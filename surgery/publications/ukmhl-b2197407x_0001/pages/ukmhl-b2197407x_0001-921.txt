887 TREATMENT OF WOUNDED BOWEL. 2. MaimselVs Method.—The ends of the bowel are first brought together by two temporary sutures, one introduced at the mesenteric border and the other opposite this. A longitudinal incision about an inch and a half long is made in the lower segment of the gut opposite the mesenteric border ; the incision begins one inch from the line of division (Fig. 328). The ends of the temporary sutures are drawn out through this incision, and by gentle traction Fig. 329.—Maimsell's Method. Second Stage : Introduction of Sntures. the divided ends of the gut are invaginated through it, the peritoneal surfaces being in contact all round. Sutures are now easily passed through all the coats of the two portions of intestine (Fig. 329). The temporary stitches are now removed, the gut drawn back, and the incision in the lower part closed with Fig. 330.—Maunseirs Metliod. Third. Stage : Closing Incision with Lembert's Sutures. interrupted Lembert's sutures (Fig. 330). Mannsell recommends stout horse- hair as the best material for the sutures. 3. FauFs Method.—A decalcified bone tube, having a needle and strong silk thread attached, is sewn with fine catgut into the upper end of the intestine. The traction thread is passed through the wall of the lower segment about three inches down (Fig. 331). The cut ends of the intestine are now sewn together with fine catgut, and the edges of the divided mesentery adjusted. By firm traction on the thread a short invagination is produced, and retained in position by three or four Lembert sutures (Fig. 332). The traction thread is then cut off short, and its ends dropped into the bowel. The principle of union of divided intestine by the formation of an invagination

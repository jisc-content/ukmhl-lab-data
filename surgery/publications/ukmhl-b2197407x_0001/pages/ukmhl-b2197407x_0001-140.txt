SPECIAL AMPUTATIONS. io8 While he is doiiijs; this, the assistant to whom this duty is entrusted, must follow the knife with his hands, grasping firmly the whole thickness of the inner flap, so as to compress the axillary artery (Fig. 50). The Surgeon should not finish cutting the flap until the assistant tells him that he holds the vessel firmly, and then he must be careful not to injure his assistant's fingers. The artery will be found to be cut long in the middle of the inner flap, and a few smaller branches may be required to be tied at its inner angle, and in the deltoid. The stump after it is healed will present the appearance shown in Fig, 52. Unless the deltoid is well developed and well covered by subcutaneous fat, it is usually impossible to make a flap sufficiently wide to form an efficient covering by transfixion, and it must then be raised by dissection.

In operating on the right side, the Surgeon, standing below the shoulder, grasps the arm and carries it slightly over the trunk ; he com- mences his incision well behind the acromion, and a short distance below the spine of the scapula, near the posterior fold of the axilla, carrying it down- wards to the level of the insertion of the deltoid, and then across the outer side of the arm and upwards to a point a little external to the coracoid process. He thus follows the ordinary rule of cutting from his left hand to his right. On the left side the direction of the incision is reversed. The deltoid being dissected up, the joint is opened and the inner flap cut in the way above described. The deltoid flap may be raised by means of a short knife, should the operator prefer it; a broad bistoury is very convenient.

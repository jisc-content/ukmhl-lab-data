335 CONTUSED AND LACERATED WOUNDS. Progress.—In the progress of a contused or lacerated wound there are two distinct periods : 1, the separation of the slough produced by the contusion; 2, the repair by granulation of the cavity left. The process by which a slough is separated has already been described on p. 270, and that of repair by granu- lation on p. 293. The Extent of the Slough depeuds not only upon the extent and severity, but also upon the situation, of the injury. If the parts around the wound be much bruised, superficial sloughing to a gi-eat extent may occur ; if the wound be deep though not extensive, there will always be danger of deep suppuration and burrowing of matter, leading to troublesome sloughing, and in some cases to secondary haemorrhage. Those wounds that are situated imme- diately over bony points—as the shin and elbow—are especially tedious, as the slough frequently implicates the fascise, and therefore separates slowly. The scalp, owing to its great vascularity, has less tendency to slough than any other part of the cutaneous suiface. In all cases of contused and lacerated wounds, in w^hich sloughing and suppuration follow the injury, there is a greater liability to the supervention of infective inflammations than in clean-cut incised wounds. In most contused wounds the extent of the slough is, to a certain extent, influenced by treatment. On each side of the wound, beyond the layer of tissue actually killed, there is an area, frequently of con- siderable extent, in which the tissues are damaged and hovering between life and death, and any additional irritation will suffice to extino-uish the remains

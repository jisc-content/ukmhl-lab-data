SPECIAL AMPUTATIONS. ii8 In operating on the left foot, the knife, a stout bistoury, should be entered immediately behind the tubercle of the scaphoid, and carried forwards to the head of the metatarsal bone of the great toe, then across the sole, and down the outer side of the foot, as far as midway between the tip of the external malleolus and the base of the fifth metatarsal bone. The two guiding points are exactly opposite each other, and if one is concealed by the swelhng of the foot, the other can usually be found. On the right foot the line of incision is reversed, being commenced on the outer side and finished on the inner (Fig. 59, b). The flap should be made long, especially at the inner side, but well rounded at the angles. For the first inch it should consist of skin and fat only, the flexor tendons of the toes being left undivided ; from this point to its base the whole of the soft parts must be dissected out from the concavity under the metatarsal bones. The sole flap having been raised, a convex incision is made over the dorsum, marking out a short flap about one inch in length, which must be raised by dissection, including all the soft parts except the tendons. The parts are well retracted, the extensor tendons divided, and the articu- lations opened by the Surgeon bearing firmly upon the anterior part of the foot, and lightly touching the ligamentous structures with the point of his bistoury. In this stage of the operation, care must be taken that the,edge Fig. 50.—A. Line of Incision for Amputa- tion of Great Toe and Metatarsal Bone. B. Line for Cliopart's Amputation. C.

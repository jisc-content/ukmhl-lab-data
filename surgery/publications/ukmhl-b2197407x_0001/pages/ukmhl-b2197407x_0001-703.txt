REDUCTION OF DISLOCATED HUMERUS. 669 passive movement is free and unaccompanied by pain, unless the muscle is stretched, while voluntary contraction of the muscle is painful, the case is probably one of bruise of the deltoid with possibly a laceration of some of its fibres. If there is slight fulness about the shoulder, with pain on passive or active movement, the case is probably one of inflammation of the joint following a bruise. At a more remote period from the injury, intense pain while at rest, aggra- vated by movement, may be due to neuritis of the brachial plexus following a strain, which may be recognized by the symptoms described in the chapter on injuries of nerves. Paralysis of the deltoid from a blow or from ivfury of the circumftex nerve may simulate a dislocation, the shoulder being flattened and the acromion Fig. •2')4.—lleduction of Uislocatioii of Humerus by elevation of tlic limb. projecting ; but here the mobility of the joint, and the presence of the head of the bone in the glenoid cavity, estabUsh the absence of dislocation. The Reduction of a dislocated humerus may be conducted on four different plans :—l, Elevatwn of the timb; 2, by manipulation; 3, by the heel in the axilla; and, 4, by the knee in the axilla. Whichever plan is adopted, if the patient be strong, it may be necessary to put him under the influence of chloroform ; when his muscles are paralysed by this agent, but little force is required to effect the reduction, the Surgeon's unaided strength usually sufficing. If more power, however, should be required than he can exercise, extension may be made by assistants drawing upon a towel properly fixed round the lower end of the humerus, or else by the pulleys attached to the same part of the limb. 1. In all cases of dislocation of the shoulder, an attempt, which will in most cases be successful, should be made to reduce the bone by simple

COMFIiESSION OF THE FEMORAL ARTERY. 53 bandage across the line of the artery, and securing it first by a few turns of a common bandage, passing in a figure-of-eight round the upper part of the thigh and the pelvis below the crest of the ilium, over which must be put a few turns of an india-rubber bandage. Compression of the femoral artery immediately below the brim of the Pif,'. 10.--Pressure with Thumbs. Application of Tourniciuet to Femoral Artery. pelvis (Fig. 19) is commonly resorted to for the temporary arrest of hemor- rhage from any part of the lower limb. The Surgeon stands by that side of the patient^ on which the vessel is to be compressed, with his back towards the patient's head and his body inclined over the pelvis. He then grasps the limb firmly with both bands, the fingers of one hand obtaining a hold on the mass of the adductor muscles, and those of the other on the posterior border of the trochantermajor. His two thumbs are placed one over the other upon the artery at a point immediately below Poupart's ligament, and exactly midway between the sym- physis pubis and the anterior superior iliac spine. Instrumental compression in this situation is employed only in the treatment of aneurism, and will be described with that disease. The popliteal artery is too deeply situated to be compressed with advantage. In bleeding from a point below the knee and above the ankle, it is better to apply the pressure to the femoral artery at the groin. The anterior and posterior tibial arteries at the ankle may conveniently be compressed during an operation on the foot (Fig. 20).

A^fPUTATION AT THE HIP-JOINT. ^47 Max Scliede has collected ."),■) cases of amputation for injury in civil practice with 39 deaths, or 70-90 per cent. Liining's carefully collected statistics of amputations for gunshot wounds show the following results : primary amputations—90 cases, 84 deaths, or 93-33 per cent.; intermediate amputations (from second to fourth day)—22 cases, 21 deaths, or 95*4r) per cent. ; secondary or late amputations—53 cases, 42 deaths, or 79-24 per cent. ; amputations in which the date is not stated— 6;') cases, 60 deaths, or 92-30 per cent. Amputation at the hip-joint for disease of the femur has undoubtedly become less fatal of late years than formerly. This is owing to the operation being performed at an earlier stage of the disease ; to a better selection of cases ; possibly to improved methods of after-treatment ; but mainly to the influence of anassthetics, and the control of haemorrhage by the use of the aortic com- pressor and elastic band. Max Schede's statistics give 153 cases with a mortality of 65, or 42-68 per cent.

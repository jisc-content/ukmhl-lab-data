124 SPECIAL AMPUTATIONS. the whole dissection of the flap, they will be divided in large numbers, greatly endangering its vitality. In the operation as performed by. Syme, the dis- section of the flap is commenced from the most prominent part of the tubercles of the OS calcis, and the knife can be kept in constant contact with the bone with the greatest ease. If, on the contrary, the incision extend far into the sole of the foot in front of the tubercles of the os calcis, it is almost impossible to dissect the flap back without the point of the knife being directed into its under surface and the vascular loops being divided. This operation is a most useful one in all cases requiring removal of the Fig. (57.â€”PirogofT's Operation. Sawing the Os Calcis obliquely downwards and forwards. whole foot. The mortality attending it is but small. The stump that is left admits of the whole weight of the body being borne upon it. Various modifications of Syme's amputation may at times be practised Avith advantage, when the soft parts covering the heel are not in a condition to form a good|basis of support. In these circumstances, the flaps may be fashioned on the side instead of from behind ; and in this way I have more than once formed an excellent covering. These lateral flaps should not, however, be made in any case that admits of disarticulation at the ankle in the ordinary way, as they never afford so good a basis of support as the integuments of the heel. Pirogoff's Amputation is characterised by the preservation of the posterior portion of the os calcis. In operating on the right side, an incision is carried across the sole of the foot fi-om the tip of the external malleolus to the corre-

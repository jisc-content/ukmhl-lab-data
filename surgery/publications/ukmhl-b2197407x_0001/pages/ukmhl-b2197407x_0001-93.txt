AMPUTATION BY THE FLAP METHOD. 6i Hey, of Leeds, and Alaiison, of Liverpool. The two former performed the operation exactly as it is done in the present day by those who practise that method (Figs. 21 and 22). The skin and fat were first divided by a single sweep of the knife and dissected up for a distance equal to half the diameter of the limb ; the muscles were then divided by another circular sweep of the knife and retracted for a distance varying from one to two inches, according to the thickness of the limb ; and the bone was sawn as high up as possible. Li the thigh and leg it was recommended by Hey to cut the posterior muscles longer than the anterior, to allow for their greater retraction. The edges of Fig. 22.â€”Amputation of the Arm by the Circular Method. Sawing the Bone. the skin were brought together in the transverse diameter of the limb, and a stump was formed with abundant covering for the bones, but necessarily with some puckering and projection at each angle. The three incisions which gained for this operation the name of " the triple incision" were, first, the incision through the skin and fat; secondly, the incision through the muscles; and finally, the circular sweep round the bone to separate the muscles for retraction. The method adopted by Alan son produced much the same result, the only difference being that he attempted to divide the muscles in such a way as to leave a hollow cone with the bone at its apex, by turning the edge of the knife obliquely upwards. This proceeding was found by other Surgeons to be inconvenient, although in Alanson's hands it produced excellent results. Amputation by the Flap Method was invented in this country by Lowdham, and was first described in a work by J. Yonge, with the extra- ordinary title of "Currus Triumphalis e Terebintho," published in 1G79.

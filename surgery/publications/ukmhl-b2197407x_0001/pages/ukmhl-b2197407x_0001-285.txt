CHRONIC ABSCESSES. 253 fascia, as in the axilla, or beneath the fascia lata, may extend through the areolar planes of the part, burrowing widely in various directions. In the medulla or cancellous tissue of bone the pus may be imprisoned by the surroundiug dense tissue and be unable to reach the surface. It is possible that very small collections of pus may become absorbed, and thus the abscess may disappear. After an abscess has burst or has been evacuated, its walls contract and become corrugated, and the cavity is gradually closed by a process of repair identical with the healing of a wound by granulation {see Process of Eepair). In some cases, however, the cavity does not completely close, but contracts into a narrow canal forming a sinus or fistula (p. 267). Acute abscesses arising in various parts of the body, as the viscera, joints or subcutaneous tissue, in consequence of the dissemination through the body of particles of infective material derived from a primary centre of inflamma- tion, and carried by the blood-stream, are termed 3Ieiastatic, and form the prominent feature of pyaemia, with which they will be described. In the neighbourhood of the alimentary canal abscesses are occasionally met with containing gas as well as pus. These are termed Tymjoanitic or Emphysematous. In some cases this is due to a definite communication with the intestines, but in others this is not so evident. These collections are often resonant on percussion, and sometimes gurgling is very distinct in them. In all acute abscesses the febrile disturbance described on p. 250 is very marked. Chronic Abscesses are often called also cold or lymphatic, or, from the tendency of some forms gradually to advance in a downward direction, gravitation abscesses. There is no sharp line to be drawn between acute and chronic abscesses.

The great majority of chronic abscesses are of tuberculous origin and the most typical form is that so commonly met with in connection with diseases of joints and bones, especially the bodies of the vertebra. The patho- logical changes met with in tubercle will be more fully described in the chapter on that disease. It will be sufficient here to state that the invasion of a part by the tubercle bacillus sets up a chronic inflammatory proces<» leadmgtothe destruction of the original tissues and the accumulation of a mass of new cells surrounding the invading organisms, and round this acrain is fi-equently a zone in which, as a result of the irritation, new connective tissue IS formed enclosing the cellular mass. In all tuberculous processes the cells enclosing the bacilli tend to undergo fatty degeneration, and thus a

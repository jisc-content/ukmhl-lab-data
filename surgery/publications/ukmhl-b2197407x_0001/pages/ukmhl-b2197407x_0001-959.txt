GANGRENOUS INFLAMMATION OF THE VULVA. 925 NOMA OF THE VULVA-GANGRENOUS VULVITIS, Gangrenous Inflammation of the Vulva of a character much resem- bling caucrum oris, and occurring under similar conditions, is occasionally met with in unhealthy, ill-fed female children, and is not uncommonly fatal. It usually attacks the surface of one labium, but soon extends to the other by contact. The parts round are swollen and inflamed, and in the centre is an ash-grey slough, which rapidly extends. The Treatment consists in wiping or scraping away the slough and applying fuming nitric acid. After this the child should be kept for some hours every day in a bath of warm boric acid lotion. When in bed, a piece of lint soaked in a solution of boric acid in glycerine and water should be placed between the labia.

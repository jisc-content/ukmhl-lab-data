SPECIAL AMPUTATIONS. 142 last A'alve, most dangerons regurgitant luBmorrhage would take place. Trans- fixion being accomplished, the anterior flap must be cut rapidly downwards about six or eight inches in length. The assistant who is to take charge of the flap passes both hands into the wound above the back of the knife, and grasps the femoral artery firmly between his fingers and thumbs (Fig. 82). As soon as he has thus secured the vessel, the Surgeon turns the edge of the knife forw^ards and completes the anterior flap. In doing this, care must bo taken not to make the flap pointed. This is best done by keeping the edge of the knife turned slightly towards the bone till the point is reached at which it is to be brought out. Also, the assistant who holds the limb must take care not to extend it too soon, but to keep it flexed and slightly adducted until the Fig. SI.â€”Ampiitation at tlie Hip-joiiit: Formation of Anterior Flap in Right Limb. anterior flap is completely cut, and the assistant who has charge of the flap must be careful not to raise it up too much nor to squeeze it laterally in grasp- ing the vessel. As soon as the knife is brought out, the assistant holding the vessel raises the flap upwards towards the abdomen. The limb, which has so far been raised, slightly flexed and adducted, must now be forcibly extended, abducted, and rotated outwards ; the capsule of the joint is then to be opened by a firm cut with the point of the knife, ks, soon as this is done, the head of the femur starts out of the socket and the operator touches the round liga- ment with the point of the knife. The assistant now allows the limb to hang down, and the head of the femur becomes separated by some distance from tlie acetabulum, and the posterior part of the capsule is brought into view and put on the stretch. This is divided with the point of the knife, and immediately it is done the assistant puts the limb in an extended position in a line with

FRACTURES. 538 and changing the cotton-wool must be deferi-ed to a latei' period. If the fracture be compound, a trap may be cut in the apparatus opposite the seat of injury, through Avhich the wound may be dressed (Fig. IGS). The advantages of the starched bandage in the treatment of fractures con- sist in its taking the shape of the hmb accurately, and maintaining it by its sohdity ; in its being hght, inexpensive, and easily applied, with materials that are always at hand. It secures complete immobility of the limb in the position in which it dries. The joints in the neighbourhood of the fractured bone are securely fixed, and the perfect adaptation of the apparatus to the inequalities of the limb prevents all movement. Thus it maintains accurately not only the length but the normal curves of the limb. From its hghtness it possesses the great advantage, in fractures of the lower extremity, of allowing the patient to move about upon crutches during nearly the whole of the treat- ment ; thus preventing the tendency to those injurious consequences that often result from prolonged confinement to bed ; and, by enabling the patient to keep up his health and strength by open air exercise, facilitating the consolidation of the fracture. In addition to this, the patient will often be able to carry on his business during treatment. By employing the starched bandage in the way just described, I scarcely ever find it necessary to keep patients in bed with simple fractures of the leg for more than from four to seven days, thus saving much of the tediousness and danger of the treatment. In several hundreds of fractures of all kinds, I employed Seutin's plan soon after its introduction into this country, putting the limb up in the starched

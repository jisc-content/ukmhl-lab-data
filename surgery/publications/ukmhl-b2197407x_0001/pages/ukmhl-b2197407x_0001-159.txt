127 FLAP AMPUTATION OF THE LEG. amputation. Holden lays down as a general rule that in amputations one inch below the head of the fibula, only one main artery—the popliteal—is divided. At two inches two arteries—the anterior and posterior tibial—and at three inches three, are cut, the peroneal being divided in addition to the two tibials. Flap Amputation of the Leg by Transfixion, which was at one time the operation usually performed in this country, is performed in the following way. The Surgeon stands with his left hand to the part to be removed, while the assistant, whose duty it is to retract the flaps, takes his stand opposite to the Surgeon. In the right limb, the point of the knife is entered at the poste- rior edge of the tibia, carried downwards for a distance of one inch and a half to two inches, then across the front of the leg to the posterior border of the Fig. 70.—Ainiiutatiou of tlie Right Leg. Transfixion of the Posterior Flap. fibula, up which the incision is made to extend to a corresponding distance. In the left leg the same incision commences on the fibular side of the limb, and terminates on the tibial. The flap thus formed, which should be broad and well rounded, is next dissected up by a few touches of the point of the knife, and transfixion of the limb is made by passing the blade across behind the bones, from one angle of the incision to the other (Fig. 70), taking care not to pass the knife between the bones instead of behind them. The posterior flap is then formed by cutting obliquely downwards and backwards ; it should be about three inches long. The bones are next cleared by a double sweep of the knife, and the interosseous soft parts divided by carrying the instrument in a figure-of-8 way between and round the bones. In doino- this, special care must be taken not to direct the edge upwards, so as to split either of the tibial arteries, more particularly the anterior ; for, as the vessel retracts above

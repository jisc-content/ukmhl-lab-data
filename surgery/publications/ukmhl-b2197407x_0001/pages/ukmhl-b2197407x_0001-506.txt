TRA UMATIC ANEURISM. 472 traumatic aneurism, communicating on one side with the artery, and on the other with the vein, which is always in a state of varix, A varicose aneurism is, in fact, a circumscribed traumatic aneurism plus an aneurismal varix. This is well rei)resented in the annexed cuts, from drawings of Sir C. Bell's, in the museum of University College, representing a varicose aneurism before and after it had been opened (Figs. 151 to 154). In this case there appears to have been a high division of the brachial, and a communicating branch below the wound, between the radial and ulnar; in consequence of which, as Fig. 153.—The same Tumour laid opeu, .sho\ving l lie Oircumsorilied False Aneurism between tlie two Vessels. Mr. Shaw informed me, the tumour pulsated as forcibly after the artery had been tied as before, the blood finding its way back through the aneurism into the veins. Gangrene of the hand and arm followed. Symptoms.—In the symptoms of varicose aneurism, we have a combination of the characters of aneurismal varix and of the circumscribed traumatic aneurism ; there is a pulsating tumour, at first soft and compressible, but, after a time, becoming more solid, in consequence of the deposit of fibrin within it; superficial to this tumour, the vein is dilated into a fusiform pouch, Fig. 154.—The opened Tumour removed from its Connections. presenting the ordinary characters of varix. The sounds heard in these tumours are of two distinct kinds : there is the peculiar buzzing thrill that always exists where there is a communication between an artery and a vein ; besides this there is a blowing or bellows sound, caused by the aneurism. These signs are most perceptible when the limb is in a dependent position ; and the sounds can often be heard in the veins at a considerable distance from the seat of injury. There is also some impairment in the nutrition and tem- perature of the parts supplied by the injured vessels. As the disease advances.

S. A.), Gross has collected the particulars of 85 cases not operated on. Of these 56 recovered and 29 died, the deaths amounting to 34-11 per cent. Tracheotomy was done in 98 cases : of these 83 recovered and 15, or 15-30 per cent., died. Durham collected 271 cases not operated on. Of these 156 recovered and 115, or 42*2 per cent., died ; whilst of 283 cases operated on, 213 recovered and 70, or 24-2 per cent., died. West (U. S. A.) has collected 1000 cases. Of these, in 63 cases the foreign body was removed by forceps, with or without the aid of the laryngoscope. Of the remaining 937 cases, 599 were not operated on. Of these 460 recovered and 139, or 23-20 per cent., died. In 398 cases the air-passages were opened. Of these 245 recovered and 93, or 27-42 per cent., died. Taking the combined results of these three tables and comparing them in reference to the particular operation performed, we find that the results are as follows : of laryngotomy there were 70 cases, in all of which probably the foreign body was impacted in the glottis, Avith 56 recoveries and 14, or 20 per cent., of deaths ; laryngo-tracheotomy, 59 cases, with 44 recoveries and 15, or 25-42 per cent., deaths ; tracheotomy was performed in 605 cases, with 449 recoveries and 156, or 25-78 per cent., deaths. The Surgeon may be hurriedly summoned to a patient, probably a child, who has " swallowed" a foreign body and is in extremis from asphyxia. Under these circumstances he should pass his finger to the back of the throat* where the foreign body may be felt and possibly extracted by using the index fingers of the two hands. Failing this, laryngotomij should at once be performed. Every moment is of consequence, and'the Surgeon who is probably single-handed, and possibly provided with no instruments beyond a penknife, is little prepared for the far more troublesome operation of tracheotomy. In the treatment of less urgent cases, emetics, sternutatories, and succus- sion of the body, are all either useless or dangerous. Inversion of the body has succeeded in several instances, and might be tried before operation is had recourse to, more particularly if the foreign body is heavy, as a coin, and is movable in the air-passage. Padley caused the ejection of a sixpenny-piece in this way from the trachea of a man, and he recommends the "supine as a safer and better position than the prone.. There is undoubtedly danger in inversion, of the supervention of laryngeal spasm, but statistics do not prove that any fatal consequences have resulted from this cause. Should, however the attempt at expulsion by inversion of the body bring on an 'attack of laryngeal spasm, it should be abandoned, as not only useless but in the hio-hest degree dangerous. When the foreign lodij is lodged in the larynx, it can be detected by laryngo- 3 H 2

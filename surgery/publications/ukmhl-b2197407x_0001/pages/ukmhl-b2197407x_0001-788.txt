INJURIES OF THE HEAD. 754 are subject to individual variations, and to a certain extent adjacent centres overlap each other. The motor region extends from the outer surface of the hemisphere a short distance on to the corresponding part of the mesial aspect. We must be cautious in transferring too readily the results of experiments upon the brain of animals, even of the higher apes, to that of man. Clinical experience in this subject is however ever increasing and tends more and Fig. 304.—Outer Surface of I^eft Cerebral Hemisijliere (Bonnet Monkey) showing the position of the Motor Areas. (Horsley and Beevor.) more to confirm the view that the results produced by injuries of the cortex iu the neighbourhood of the sulcus of Eolando are the same in the human subject as those following experimental injury of the corresponding parts in the lower animals. The evidence obtained by direct electrical excitation of the cerebral cortex in man is necessarily very scanty. The accompanying figure (Fig. 305), for which I am indebted to Victor Horsley, indicates the Fig. 305.—Outer Surface of Right Cerebral Hemisphere (Man) showing Results obtained by Electrical Stimulation. (Horsley.) results of such excitations, and a comparison of Figs. 304 and 305 at once shews that these results are uniform in the two cases. The symptoms produced by damage to the motor area of the cortex may be divided into primary and secondary, according as they are immediately induced at the time of the injury, or nppear later as the result of inflammation or spreading oedema around the injured part. When, as the result of either

If the disease be limited to the anterior part, the shaft of the bone should be cut across with a fine saw. This method has the advantage of leaving the sole uninjured. •>.

The Metatarsal Bone of the Little Toe should be removed by a racket- shaped incision, so as to avoid wounding the sole. This is best done by entering the knife just behind the tubercle of the bone, carrying it forwards Fig. 00.-Amputation of the Little Too an.l its M.tatavsal Bone by the Racket-shaped Incision. and mwards, in the line of its articulation with the cuboid, to the centre of the fourth digital interspace, and thence forwards to the web of the toe • the km e IS next carried round the plantar surface of this, the incision bein<. continued obbque^; into that which has been made on the dorsum of tlle toot (Fig. 06).

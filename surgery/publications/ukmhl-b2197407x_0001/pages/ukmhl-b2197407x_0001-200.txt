The tongue of the toad has been examined by Dowdeswell with the object of ascertaining whether the fixed connective-tissue corpuscles take any part in the formation of the new cells which appear in inflammation. The details of his observations were published in the proceedings of the Royal Society in 1876, and he gives the following brief summary of the results he obtained : " So long as the circulation continued, no change whatever took place in the connective-tissue corpuscles, either as regards form or appearance, notwith- standing that the tissue of which they formed part was beset with innumerable emigrant colourless corpuscles, or (to use ordinary language) was infiltrated Fig. 85.â€”Inflamed Fat. Showing the fat cells with leucocytes between them. The migi-ation is most abundant neai- a small vessel. Large granular cells derived from fat cells are seen. with pus." In some cases the tongue was watched for eight or even nine days. The conclusions drawn from these observations are confirmed by the miscroscopic examination of specimens of other inflamed tissues. In fat the leucocytes are found crowding between the fat cells, especially in the neigh- bourhood of small blood-vessels (Fig. 85) ; in muscle they accumulate between the fibres which themselves show no change, unless the process be very acute, and then the alteration is in the direction of degeneration, not of growth (Fig, 86). In bone the Haversian canals become filled with leucocytes ; and should the process be of sufficient intensity and duration, the solid tissue dis- appears before the new cells, while at the same time the bone-corpuscles show no change unless one of degeneration. Thus acute inflammation in its early

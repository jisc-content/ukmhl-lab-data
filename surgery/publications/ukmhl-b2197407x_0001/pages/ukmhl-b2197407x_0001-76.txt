GEXERAL REMARKS ON OPERATIONS. 44 Where the tissues are very lax beneath the fascia, it is often a convenient plan to guide a probe-pointed bistoury on tlie forefinger of the left hand, instead of using a director. The finger is the best director when it can be used, as it can be guided more or less by sensation. Occasionally in deepening a wound through very loose structures, amongst which important vessels may lie, as in removing tumours from the root of the neck or the axilla, the Surgeon may prefer to make use of a blunt instrument, and to tear the tissues instead of Fig. 7.â€”Dissection through a fascia.

He must work methodically, picking up what he intends to tear with the forceps, and being careful to tear only wdiat he has thus seized. In some cases a properly cultivated finger-nail or thumb-nail will be found a most useful instrument. PREVENTION OP HEMORRHAGE DURING OPERATIONS. In every operation involving the use of the knife, loss of blood is the primary danger to be guarded against. This may be prevented most con- veniently in the extremities by the use of the tourniquet or the elastic band, or by an assistant compressing the main artery of the limb. If the seat of the operation be such as not to admit of this, the assistant may compress the bleeding vessels as they arc divided during the operation ; and as soon as it is

$6 AMPUTATIONS. III. The circumstances connected with the amputation itself that influence materially its result are : 1. Its Seat. 2. The Structure of the Bone sawn. 3. Whether for Injury or Disease. 4. If for disease, the Nature of the affection. 5. If for injury, the Tiine that has elapsed before the operation. 1. With regard to the influence of the Seat of amputation on the result as a general rule, the risk increases with the size of the part amputated, and as the line of amputation approaches the trunk ; in fact, the nearer it is to the trunk, the greater is the danger. This is clearly shown by the subjoined table, derived from the statistics of amputation in various British, Continental, and American hospitals.* SEAT. Shoulder-joint . Arm .... Fore-arm . Hip-joint Thigh Leg . .... CASES. DEATHS.

CASES. DEATHS. PEK CENT. Shoulder-joint 19 (5 31-6 30 4 13-3 49 8 16-3 16 12 75-0 151 35 23-1 100 14 14-0 42 9 4-7 The higher death-rate in the amputations of the fore-arm was due to the fact that two were cases of disease in extreme old age, and two were performed as a last chance of saving a case of tetanus. If we turn to the records of military surgery we find similar results. In the war of the American rebellion the percentages of mortality were as follow, showing markedly how rapidly it runs up in accordance with the size of the part removed : fingers and hand, 1-6 ; wrist, 5*5 ; fore-arm, IG-T) ; arm, 21'2 ; shoulder, 39-2 ; partial of foot, 9-2 ; ankle-joint, 13-4 ; leg, 2G ; knee, 55; thigh, 64-4 ; hip, 85-7. Not only is there this increase in the rate of mortality as the operation approaches the trunk, but in the larger limbs, more especially in the thigh, eveiy additional inch that is removed appears to make a difference in this respect. Thus, in our army in the Crimea, of 178 amputations of the thigh, 44 were in the upper third, and of these 38, or 86 per cent., proved fatal ; 68 * The reader who may wish for fuller details of the stati.stics of amputations in the past and ni modern : times may refer to the Tables i)ublished in the last edition of Cooper's "Surgical Dictionary," by Mr. •James Lane; Sir J.

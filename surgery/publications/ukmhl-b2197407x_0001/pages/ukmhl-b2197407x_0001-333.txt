CIRCUMSTANCES AFFECTING THE HEALING PROCESS. 299 contains practically nothing capable of decomposing and if could always ensure that a wound should be in this state, no antiseptic ti-eatment would ever be necessary. Unfortunately this is not the case ; and, therefore,_ sonae form of antiseptic treatment undoubtedly gives an additional certainty m the treatment of wounds, more especially those with cavities, such as compound ^'lIX", union may be prevented by the introduction of the specific poison of some infective, spreading inflammation, as in some forms of septicemia m erysipelas or hospital gangrene. That these poisons are generated in hit 1, and are destroyed by antiseptics, may be considered as beyond a doubt; and this forms an additional reason for the habitual employment of these agents The use of antiseptics cannot make any wound do better than heal by first intention, a result obtained with great frequency m all well-dramed wounds kept at perfect rest in healthy subjects; but it can, and does prevent the evil consequences that may result from some accidental failure m drain- age, and thus has tended greatly to improve the average results of the treatment of wounds. There are other circumstances, apart from the local conditions with which we have hitherto dealt, that are not without influence on the processes of repair in wounds : the age, temperament, previous state of health and constitution of the patient, his occupation and usual mode of life, the situation in which he is placed after the receipt of the injury, and many other matters, must all more or less afiPect the result. The scrofulous or scorbutic diathesis, or the presence of amyloid degeneration of the liver, or disease of the kidneys, &c., must always militate against rapidity and perfection of cure. Habits of intemperance and over-indulgence, privation, exposure, bad sanitary and hygienic conditions, are all alike antagonistic to reparative action. These are points to which the Surgeon's attention must be directed, with the view of counteracting them as far as lies in his power by appropriate precautions and treatment.

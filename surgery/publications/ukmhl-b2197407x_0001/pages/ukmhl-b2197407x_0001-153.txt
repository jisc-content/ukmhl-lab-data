Disarticulation of the Foot at the Ankle-joint was first reduced by Syme to a regular operation. By its performance amputation of the leg may Fig. 63.—T. Line of Incision for Tripier's Oiieration. S.

In describing the operation on the right foot Syme's words as to the direction of the incision are : " The foot being held at a right angle to the leg, the point of the knife is introduced immediately below the malleolar pro- jection of the fibula, rather nearer its posterior than anterior edge, and then

58o SPECIAL FRACTURES. affected side, so as to relax the muscles, and supports his elbow and forearm in the sound hand, in order to take off the weight of the limb ; he is unable to raise his arm from the side, and any attempt to do so causes severe pain. When the fracture occurs near to the sternal end of the bone, it is usually, if not always, transverse. If it occur internally to the rhomboid ligament, the outer fragment is displaced forward, but remains on the same horizontal level as the sternal fragment. If the triple displacement of the outer fragment, characteristic of fractured clavicle, viz., in a direction downwards, forwards, and inwards, have occurred, then R. W. Smith believes that, however near the joint the fracture may appear to be, it must in reality Fii have occurred externally to the costo-clavicular ligament, which is too strong to admit of this displacement, or to be ruptured, and so to allow it to take place. In ordinary simple fracture of the clavicle the blood-vessels passing under the bone are very rarely, if ever, injured or even compressed. This is owing to the manner in which the outer fragment is displaced, its sternal end being pushed in front of them and to their inner side. Comminuted Fracture of the Clavicle is the result of severe direct violence. It is a dangerous accident, as the subclavian vein and adjacent plexus of nerves, or the upper part of the pleura, may be seriously injured. In a case that was under my care, the subclavian vein was apparently

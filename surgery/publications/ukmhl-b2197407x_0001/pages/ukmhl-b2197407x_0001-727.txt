693 DORSAL, OF FEMUR—SYMPTOMS. Sijniptoms.—l^ the head of the bone have been displaced aljove the oUuraior and upon the dorsum of the ilium, the hip will be found to be a good deal dis- torted, the o-luteal region being somewhat prominent, and the upper part of the thigh enlarged, in consequence of the approximation of the muscular attachments, so as to give an appearance of widening to the hip. The head of the bone can be felt in its new situation, more especially on rotating the Umb ; the trochanter is less prominent than natural, usually lying close against the brim of the acetabuUim, and being turned forwards ; it lies con- siderably above " Xolaton's line " drawn from the anterior superior spine of the ilium to the tuberosity of the ischium ; there is marked shortening, vary- ing from one to two inches in some cases, perhaps even as much as three inches. The amount of shortening will necessarily depend upon the distance to which the head of the bone is thrown wpicards on the dorsum. The position of the limb is remarkable, being distinctly rotated inwards, with the thigh slightly bent ui)on the abdomen, and the leg upon the thigh, so that the knee is semi-flexed, and raised from the surface on which the patient is lying. The foot is inverted, so that the ball of the great toe rests on the instep or against the ankle of the sound limb ; and the heel is somewhat raised. The axis of the dislocated thigh is directed across the lower third of § the sound thigh. The movements of the joint are greatly impaired; abduction and eversion are not practicable, but inversion, adduction, and a certain ^ amount of flexion upon the abdomen, can be practised. When the patient is ■ lying flat, with the knee slightly raised and advanced, the lumbar spine is on

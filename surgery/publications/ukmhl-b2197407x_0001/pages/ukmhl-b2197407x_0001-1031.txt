TREATMENT OF TETANUS. 997 to the tetanic spasms of strychnia, it was hoped that it would he found equally useful as a sedative to the spinal cord in those arising from traumatic causes. In E. Watson's hands, very successful results followed its administra- tion. Yet it is far from being a specific. I have tried it in severai cases, with no appreciable good effect. It may be given by the mouth, hypodermically, or per anum: in the form of a solution or a tincture of the extract in half- grain doses, by the mouth ; hypodermically, in doses of one-sixth of a grain ; per a7iim, in grain doses. The dose should be given at least every second hour, until complete contraction of the pupil occurs. Stimulants, as brandy, should be administered to counteract the depression that will result from the use of the drug. At the same time that recourse is had to such measures as these, it must not be forgotten that the disease is one of great exhaustion, and that the patient will die worn out, unless he be supplied with plenty of nourishment. Beef-tea and wine should, therefore, be administered by the mouth, as long at the patient can swallow, and nutritious enemata by the rectum ; and in this way the powers of hfe may be supported until the violence of the disease has spent itself. I am, however, disposed to think that even in these chronic cases, much more may be done by simple than by specific treatment. Clearing out the bowels by a turpentine enema, breaking the violence of the spasms and giving the patient rest and ease by chloroform inhalations or by chloral enemata, and keeping up the powers of the system by injections of beef-tea, egg, and brandy into the rectum, till the disease wears itself out, appear most likely to be followed by a satisfactory result, when used in addition to the hygienic measures recommended in the acute form of the disease.

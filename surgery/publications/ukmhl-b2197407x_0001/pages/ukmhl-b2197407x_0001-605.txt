TREATMENT OF UXVNITED FRACTURE. 57i perfect exposure of the ends of the fragments, the fibroi^ ^'''''^^T^^i^^^ false joint may be cut through if necessary. The end of one ot f-^^^^^ being thoroughly cleaned, it must be sawn off either obhquely or ^^^^^^^^^^^^ according to the line of the fracture, or, if more convenient, a chisel ^^^^^^^^ may be Ssed to cut it through. As a rule, a smooth and more regular su face is obtained by using the saw. The opposite fragment is then treated m the same way. The two ends are next brought in contact and wired oi P g^e^ together. In wiring the fragments a hole must be drilled oblique y fiom the surface of each into the medullary canal. A strong piece of thick, tolerably soft, silver wire must be passed through the holes, and the fragments drawn into accurate apposition. The wire may be quite safely left in the wound, and the two ends cut short and hammered down flat on the bone, so as to leave no projecting points. 14. u --p in all cases some shortening of the limb must necessarily result, but it solia union can be obtained, this is of little consequence. In operating on the forearm or leg, if both bones are affected, care must be taken to remove an equal length from each. If the fracture he very oblique, the section ot the bone must be in the same line so as to cause as little shortening as possible. Nussbaum, in a case of gunshot fracture of the ulna with loss of substance, cut awav the rounded ends of the fragments and the fibrous tissue uniting them, and transplanted into the space thus formed a slice of the compact tissue of the upper fragment with the periosteum covering it, leaving a bridge of that membrane undivided. Good bony union resulted. Operations for ununited fracture rarely succeed when the disunion is owing to other than local causes. They may, however, succeed in old people. I have united a femur that had been disunited for nearly twelve months in a man between sixty and seventy by Dieffenbach's method. The more thickly the bone is covered by the soft parts, the more likely will an operation be_ to succeed. Hence, the humerus and femur are more favourable for operation than the tibia. On reviewing the various methods that have been recommended for the treatment of ununited fracture, it would appear that if the period of normal union has been exceeded by but a few weeks, rubbing the ends of the bones forcibly together, constriction, or percussion may be tried, followed by the appli- cation of a plaster of Paris bandage. Should these measures have no effect, further efforts may be made to excite a sufficient degree of inflammation by in- jection of iodine or by subcutaneous section and scraping of the ends of the frag- ments. Should this fail, the seat of fracture should be cut down upon, and if it be found that there is firm fibrous union, the insertion of Dieffenbach's pegs might be sufficient, as if the proper amount of irritation be set up, the intervening fibrous tissue becomes converted into bone ; but if there is a distinct false joint, it had better be removed and the bevelled ends wired or pegged together. If union should fail, much may be done to relieve the patient by properly devised apparatus, but if the i'alse joint be situated in the femur or tibia, the limb may be so useless and cumbersome to him, that amputation may be required as a last resource.

The death of a part of the body is, in surgical language, termed Mortifi- cation or Gangrene. In pathological language the term Necrosis is apphed to local death generally, in whatever part or tissue it occurs ; but in surgical practice it is customary to confine it to affections of the bones or cartilages : when limited to the soft tissues of a limb it is spoken of as Spha- celation; and when accompanied by ulceration, it is called Sloughing Many other varieties of gangrene are recognized, by Surgeons. Like most other diseases, it may be Acute or Chronic in its duration. As the parts affected are moist and swollen, or dry and shrivelled, it may be divided into the Moist and the Dry or Mummified gangrene ; so again, according to its cause, it is spoken of as Spontaneous or Traumatic; and very frequently, it is arranged according to the nature of its cause under the denominations of Constitutional and Local. Besides these, various Specific forms of the disease are met with which will require special consideration.

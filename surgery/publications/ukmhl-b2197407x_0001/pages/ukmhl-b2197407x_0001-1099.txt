SCIRRHUS: '-STRUCTURE. encephaloid than scirrhous. In the lymphatic glands they are often almost as firm as the original tumour. Structure.—On cutting into a scirrhus with the scalpel, it usually creaks somewhat as it is divided, and presents a whitish or bluish-white glisten- ing surface, intersected by white bands, which apparently consist partly of new Fig. 3S9.—Scin-bus of Breast (ISS diam.). Tiie coiiimunication of the alveolar spaces between one anotlioi-, and the continuity of the contained naasses of cells are well shown. structure, and partly of included areolar tissue. This section has not inaptly been compared to the appearance presented by a cut through a turnip or an unripe pear. A curious feature of hard cancer, in which it differs from almost all other tumours, is that it becomes cup-shaped on section. This seems to be due to Fig. 300.-Scirrhus of Breast (188 diaivi.). In the alveolus which occupies the ceiiti-e of the liKure the accurat<i apposition of the cancer cells without any intervening stroma i.s clearly seen. the fact that a kind of cicatrization often takes place in the central parts, while the peripheral parts are still growing. The cells undergo fatty degenera- tion and break up. The greater part of the products of ' degeneratfon are absorbed, and only a narrow streak of graijules may be left to represent a once

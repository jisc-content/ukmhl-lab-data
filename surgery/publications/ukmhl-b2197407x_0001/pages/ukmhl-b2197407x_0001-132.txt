SPECIAL AMPUTATIONS. TOO eluded in the same way as in the transfixion method. Should the metacarpo- phalangeal articulation be opened, the phalanges must be removed, and the head of the metacarpal bone seized in a pair of lion-forceps, after which no difficulty will be found in finishing the operation. Fig. 40 shows the hand after amputation of the thumb and its metacarpal bone. The Metacarpal Bones, with or without the fingers supported by them, occasionally require re- moval for disease or injury. For these operations, which are not of a very regular kind, it is difficult to lay down definite rules ; in performing them, care should be taken to make flaps of sufficient size, and to avoid cutting into the palm if possible. It is well not to disarticulate the lower end of the bones, so as to open the wrist-joint, but rather to cut them off' a little above this with bone-forceps or a metacarpal saw. In injuries from the explosion of powder - flasks or gun - barrels, when the hand is much shattered, it is of great consequence to avoid cuttino- up the palm to too great an extent; and it is well in these cases if possibfe to save a finger, which will be of more use to the patient than any artificial limb, however ingeniously constructed (Figs. 41 and 42).

In all cases in which the extent of the injury is doubtful, the hand may be rendered

iQ72 " r -o r TUMOURS. '^^ ? ^ ing irregularly cylindrical processes communicating with each other. From the irregular course of these processes, they are cut in a variety of directions in every thin section, so that the groups of cells do not give the idea of cylinders, but rather of circular, oval, and irregular masses not in direct connexion with each other. Between these cylinders is a fibrous tissue bearing abundant vessels for the nutrition of the non-vascular epithelium. This fibrous tissue is more or less infiltrated with small round cells, iu proportion to the rapidity of the growth of the tumour. It will be seen from the above description that the structure of a squamous carcinoma, although differing in detail, is in the main similar to that of glandular carcinoma : that is to say, cells of an epi- Fig. lii'li.

As in normal squamous epithelium covering a papilla of the skin, the cells next to the fibrous and vascular tissue are softer and rounder in form than those of greater age. In the centre of the terminal portion of a cylinder of cells or in a branching process from it, the epithelium often becomes flattened by pressure, and arranged circularly so as to form a globe (epithelial nest, epithelial pearl). These nest-like formations are produced, according to Virchow, by the remarkable tendency to endogenous cell-growth exhibited by some of the central cells, and the development of large " brood-spaces " within them. The pressure produced by this formation of brood-spaces, and the endogenous cell-growth accompanying it, cause the marginal cells to become flattened and to take on a concentric arrangement. Possibly these globes may 1)6 formed in both ways ; but the appearance usually presented by them rather suggests the former than the latter process, as the central parts are most

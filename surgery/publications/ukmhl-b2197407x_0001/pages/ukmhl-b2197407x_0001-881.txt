847 GASTROTOMY. clasping hook at each end, to pass without the slightest difficulty or pain four days after it was swallowed by a gentleman about 25 years of age. Iso attempt need ever be made to extract small coins from the stomach, as they will always easily pass through the intestinal canal. If the foreign body lodges in the stomach, producing irritation with continued eiForts at vomiting, an attempt may be made to remove it through the gullet, but the chances of success are very small. If the attempt be made, an ivory-balled probang should first be passed in to ascertain the situation of the foreign body. After this has been heard and felt, we may try the plan successfully employed by Little—who removed a hooked plate containing five artificial teeth from the stomach of a woman—of introducing a " coin-catcher" so as to search for, secure, and then extract it. In doing this, there is of course a great proba- bility that the mass will be drawn up sideways ; and that it may, if broad, hitch in the pharynx, whence it must be detached as well as the Surgeon can manage by a judicious combination of force and skill. If the body be of such a nature that it is impossible to remove it through the oesophagus, and it is equally unlikely that it can pass safely through the intestines, the operation of Gastrotomy must be performed. This is seldom required except in the case of the swallowing of a fork or knife, or some such instrument, either intentionally by a lunatic, or accidentally during drunken- ness, or while performing a trick. The foreign body when of this size can usually be felt without difficulty through the abdominal wall. The operation of gastrotomy for the removal of foreign bodies has been singularly successful. Durham states that of ten recorded cases only one died, and in that one cesophagotomy had previously been performed. The operation will be described in the chapter on stricture of the oesophagus. V

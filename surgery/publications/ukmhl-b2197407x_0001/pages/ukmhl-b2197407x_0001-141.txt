AMPUTATION AT THE SHOULDER. It must be changed for a long amputating knife after the joint is opened. This method of operating is specially adapted to cases of disease, and more particularly of tumours of the humerus, by which the soft parts are stretched and thinned. Amputation by antero-posterior flaps, or Lisfranc's method, differs some- what from the operation described above. It is thus performed :—If it is the left arm that is to be removed, the Surgeon grasps the limb as near the elbow as possible, and carries it outwards nearly to a right angle with the trunk. He then inserts the knife immediately in front of the posterior fold of the axilla, and passing it forwards so that it crosses the neck of the humerus at its posterior aspect immediately below the head, he makes the point emerge Fig. 01.—Amputation at tlie Slioulder by Spence'.s Method. just in front of the acromion. The knife is next brought out in such a way as to cut a neatly rounded flap some four inches or more in length from the posterior aspect of the limb. The arm is then crossed over the body, the joint opened, and the operation linisliod in the same way as that previously described In operating on the right side the transfixion is made from a point immediately in front ot the acromion to the posterior border of the axilla. The great rapidity with which this operation can be performed caused it to be highly appreciated before he invention of chloroform. It leaves the scar, however, in a more exposed situation than when a pure deltoid flap is raised Amputation at the Shoulder ly the Oval Method.-lr, cases in which, from the state of the bone, the manipulations necessary for amputation by transfixion are impossible, the method originally invented by Larrey, or some modification

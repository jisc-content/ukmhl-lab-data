5o6 INJURIES OF NERVES, MUSCLES, AND TENDONS. support in a sling the consequence. Guthrie relates several remarkable cases occurring in military practice, of i3rogressive atrophy of a part of the muscular wall of the abdomen following blows. In Rupture of the Muscles or Tendons of the Arms or Shoulder is all the special treatment needed. When the muscles about the shoulder are the seat of injury, rapid ati'ophy is apt to ensue, probably owing to the implication of the circumflex and suprascapular nerves, and consequent interference with the ""^ ^ nutrition of the part. Fig. 157 is a good illustra- V % tion of the remote effects of such a strain of the capsular muscles of the shoulder-joint. In this case the accident was caused by severe dragging upon the arm by the reins of a runaway horse. In division of the Extensor Tendons of the Fingers—a very common accident—the tendons should, if possible, be united with catgut or tendon sutures, and the hand must be kept extended on a straight splint for three weeks until perfect union has taken place. The Flexor Tendons of the hand may also Ix- divided, either on the fingers or in the palm. In these cases the tendons should, if possible, be sutured, after which the fingers and wrist must be flexed and fixed on a suitable splint. Extensive retraction of the upper ends of the tendons often occurs, so that they can only be reached by carefully enlarging the wound upwards with strict antiseptic precautions. Should the first operation fail, or should the division of the tendon have been overlooked at the time of the injury, secondary suture may be performed after the wound has healed. In a case recorded by Mayo Robson, four and a half inches of the flexor tendon of a hopelessly smashed middle finger were successfully used to replace the tendon of the extensor indicis which had been torn away by the same injury.

FEMUR— VARIETIES. 687 commonly thrown upwards and somewhat backwards, so as to lodge on the slightly concave suiface between the acetabulum and the crista ilii, resting on the gluteus minimus, and having the trochanter turned forwards (Fig. 267) ; or the head may be thrown downwards into the foramen ovale, lying upon the obturator externus muscle (Fig. 269); or forwards and upwards upon the horizontal branch of the pubi^c bone under the psoas and iliacus muscles, to the outer side of the femoral vessels (Fig. 270); lastly he described a variety in which the head of the bone was supposed to be thrown backwards Df.Sr.OCATIONS OF THE HEAD OF THE THIGH BONE, ACCORDING TO AMTLEY GOOI'ER's CLASSIFICATION.

It has since been shown, however, that the peculiar features of this form are due not to the head of the bone sinking into the notch, but to the relation of the femur to the obturator internus muscle. The classification originally given by Astley Cooper has been slightly modified in accordance with the more accurate knowledge we now possess It has been shown by experiments on the dead body that the most important structure in the mechanism of dislocation of the hip is the ilio-femoral lio-a.

SPECIAL AMPUTATIONS. 96 man, however, it is better to save even one phalanx, as it helps somewhat to strengthen the grasp ; for the stump can be strongly flexed, partly by the action of the interossei and partly by the long flexors which form new attach- ments at its extremity. In the case of the index finger, it will be better always to leave the proximinal phalanx, the stump of which forms a useful opponent to the thumb. Amputation is frequently required at the Metacarpo-phalangeal Articu- lation. Here it may be done in two ways : either by lateral flaps, or by the oval method. If by lateral flaps, the adjoining fingers should be well sepa- rated from the one about to be removed, by an assistant who grasps the hand, so as to put the integument on the dorsum upon the stretch. The point of a bistoury is entered immediately above the head of the metacarpal bone, Fig. 35.—Amputation of tlie Index Finger. Removing the Head of the Metacarpal Bone. carried forwards to a point opposite the interdigital web, drawn across the side of the finger, and then carried a little way into the palm. This same pro- cess is performed upon the opposite side, the flaps are dissected down by a few touches of the knife, the extensor tendon is divided, the joint opened, and dis- articulation performed. The oval method, which is undoubtedly the better, as it does not wound the palm, consists in entering the bistoury at the same point as in the last case, carrying it as far as the point at which the web joins the finder which is being taken off, on the operator's right hand side ; then across the°palmar aspect, in the line of the fold in the skin at the root of the finger, to the web on the other side. Thus far the incision may be made without takino- the knife out of the wound. The oval is completed by putting the point^of the knife in the end of the first incision and carrying it upwards to I

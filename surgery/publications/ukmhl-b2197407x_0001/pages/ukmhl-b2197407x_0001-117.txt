SEPTIC DISEASE FOLLOWING AMPUTATION. 85 The causes of death amongst the uncomplicated cases were as follows :— CAUSES or DEATH. 1871—1S75. 1876—1880. 1881—18S5. 1880-1800.

The two deaths in the uncomplicated cases in the last period were after amputation at the hip-joint. These tables show a satisfactory and progressive diminution in the death- rate, especially in that arising from septic diseases. In fact, there has not been a death from pysemia after amputation in University College Hospital since 1880. Another interesting feature in these statistics is the great diminu- tion in the number of secondary amputations in the last ten years, showing the success that has attended the treatment of compound fractures. The total • number of amputations has also considerably diminished ; by no less than 30 per cent, if we compare the last five years with the first. This also is evidently in great part due to the success attending conservative surgery after injury. The amputations for disease have also considerably diminished in proportion to the patients admitted, for in 1879 about twenty surgical beds were added to the hospital. The number of amputations for disease of the knee is, in the last period, only half what it is in the first—another evidence of the advance of conservative surgery. The amputation mortality in my wards, from 1850 to 1873, was 407 per cent, for injury and 18*1 for disease, on an aggregate of 387 cases, being 25-8 per cent, for all cases. Although the improvement that has taken place generally in the ampu- tation mortality is no doubt chiefly due to the employment of antiseptics, the better hygienic arrangements of modern hospitals cannot be ignored as a factor in lessening the liability to the generation of septic diseases. Many Surgeons also, who have not adopted any special antiseptic method of treat- ment, have achieved, by a careful selection of cases, by improved methods of operating, by perfect drainage and rest, and great attention to cleanliness results which have rarely been surpassed. Spence, of Edinburgh, had once a run of 63 consecutive amputations with only three deaths. Amongst the most excellent results of this class that have been published, are those of Borland of Kilmarnock, who out of 25 major primary amputations (double amputations being excluded), had G deaths, or 24 per cent., and in G3 amputations, secondary and for disease, only 2 deaths, or 3-1 per cent. These results were obtained without chemical antiseptics, by avoiding the use of water during the opera- tion, the blood being wiped away with pieces of clean rag, and by leavino- the wound to glaze before bringing the flaps together, with perfect rest of the stump, which was dressed with a thin piece of rag smeared with lard, any dis- charge that formed being wiped away.

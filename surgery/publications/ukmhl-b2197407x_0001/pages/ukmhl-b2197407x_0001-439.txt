V CHILBLAIN. If the person who has been exposed to cold be apparently dead, he must be put in a cold room, the temperature of which must be very slowly raised. Friction, as just described, should be practised, and artificial respiration set up. These means must be continued for a long time, even if no signs of hfe appear; there being on record instances of recovery after several hours of suspended animation. Chilblain is a mild form of frost-bite occui'ring in children and in delicate adults. It occurs on the toes and fingers, and occasionally on other exposed parts, as the nose or ear. It is especially likely to occur in paralyzed or diseased hrabs. Most commonly the inflammation does not extend beyond redness and swelling, with burning pain or intense itching. In more severe cases the inflammation of the skin extends to vesication, and occasionally, when the blister bursts, a small slough of the superficial part of the cutis, or in some cases even of its whole thickness, is found beneath. This forms the so-called " broken chilblain." Treatment.â€”Very bad chilblains in children, or chilblains of any kind in the adult, are indications of some degree of debility. Healthy exercise, good diet, warm clothing, wash-leather socks, and tonics are useful. Locally, as a preventive, friction with spirits of wine or camphorated oil is useful ; in the simple erythematous stage, the application of tincture of iodine is often recommended, or soap liniment to which a little chloroform has been added. Belladonna and soap liniment in equal parts allay tiie intolerable itching. If a slough forms, boric acid lint or ointment forms a useful application. Unguentum resiuEe hastens the healing.

56 GENERAL REMARKS ON OPERATIONS. It is of the utmost importance that the bowels should be kept regularly open, as constipation is often a great trouble from the sudden confinement to bed and loss of exercise. It is needless again to insist on the great import- ance of general cleanliness and ventilation. The remote effect of the major operations is a subject that requires investigation. Do people who have undergone any of the greater operations, and who have recovered from the immediate effects, as a rule, live as long as those who have not sustained a mutilation ? I am disposed to think that they do not. When we reflect on the number of persons who, before the age of thirty, suffer amputation of one of the limbs for injury, it is remarkable how seldom one sees an old person in a hospital or elsewhere, who has lost a limb in early life. I am, of course, speaking only of amputations for injury ; for those who have undergone this operation for strumous affections or mahgnant tumours, frequently die early from recurrence of the disease m other parts of the body. So also with respect to lithotomy. Very many boys are cut for stone every year and recover ; but I scarcely recollect to have met with a middle-aged adult who had been operated on in childhood. The various Special Operations will be considered when treating of the several Injuries and Diseases for which they are required ; but, as Amputations do not readily fall under any special head, being required for a great variety of different conditions, it will be more convenient to consider them here.

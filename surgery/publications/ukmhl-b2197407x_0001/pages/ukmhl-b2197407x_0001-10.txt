VI PREFACE. Chapter on Gynfecological Surgery; and Mr. C\ Louis Taylor has given valuable assistance in carrying the work through the Press. " The Author is also deeply indebted to Mr. T. W. V. Lawrence, Curator of the Museum of University College, for the care which he has taken in supervising generally the Illustrations of the book, and for many new Figures from his pencil. Several of the old wood-cuts have been cancelled and re-drawn, and many new ones have been added. In the few instances in which a wood-cut has been copied from another work, the name of the author of the work from which it is taken has been appended to it. When no such acknowledgment is made, the figure is original, belongs exclusively to this work, and except in the case of diagrams has been drawn from nature. The Author may be excused for laying stress on these points, as many of his illustrations have been copied into other works on Surgery without any acknowledgment of the source whence they have been taken. The Author feels that a responsibility, weighty in proportion to the very extent of the wide diffusion of his instruction, is incurred by him who takes upon himself the task of teaching others that Science which underlies the Art, and that Art, the exercise of which con- stitutes the application to Practice of a great branch of Medical Knowledge, which more directly than any other Department of Medicine involves the physical well-being, and more immediately affects the life of those on whom it is exercised. It is not sufficient that the teaching of a Scientific Art, such as Surgery, should be sound in those General Laws that constitute its Principles. It must also be accurate in those minute details that are necessary to its successful Practice, and, above all, just in its estimate of the labours of others. A Teacher of Surgery, who seeks to give a true and impartial view of the subject of his tuition, is placed in much the same position as a Judo-e wbo is summing up a great cause.

INFECTIVE DISEASES OF WOUNDS. 938 limb—the inner or posterior—to a much greater extent than the other. In amputating under such circumstances, the Surgeon may often very advan- tageously so fashion his flaps as to exclude as much as possible of the affected part or side of the limb, forming them chiefly from that least affected. The principal source of danger, after amputation in these cases, is recurrence of the morbid condition in the stump, more particularly in the lower extremity. Out of twelve cases in which I have seen or done amputation for this disease this recurrence happened in seven instances. The tendency wiU be increased by the proximity of the line of amputation to the gangrenous limit. But, even under the most unfavourable circumstances, recovery will sometimes take place. Thus I have seen the flaps in amputation for spreading gangrene infiltrated with gelatinous-looking fluid, and yet recovery take place. In a man whose arm I amputated at the shoulder-joint for spreading gangrene of the limb, the infiltration had extended as high as the scapula; yet he made an excellent recovery. In the lower extremity the liability to recurrence of the gangrene is, however, very much greater ; and there can be but very little prospect of saving the patient if the thigh has once become reddened and infiltrated, even though the gangrene do not extend above the knee—invasion of the stump ensuing under such circumstances with almost absolute certainty. Much of the success of the case will depend on the after-treatment. This must consist principally of antiseptic dressings to the stump, full doses of liquor opii, and the early and free administration of stimulants, more parti- cularly brandy and wine ; attention to these points will often bring the patient through, though usually not without much difficulty and great constitutional disturbance.

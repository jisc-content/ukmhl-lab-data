886 INJURIES OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. This can be quite efficiently done by the fingers of an assistant, but numerous clamps have been devised, of which one of the best is that recommended by Makins. A simple method consists in surrounding the gut with a piece of small drainage-tube passed through the mesentery and knotted or held in catch-forceps. The segment of bowel is now removed, care being taken that the incisions are made well beyond the diseased or injured portion. If the part requiring removal is small no mesentery need be excised ; if large, a triangular piece of the mesentery should be cut away, and the edges sutured. Whatever method be employed for uniting the intestine, great care must be taken in inserting the sutures at the mesenteric border, where a narrow strip of the muscular coat is exposed between the layers of the serous membrane. The principal methods of uniting the intestine will now be shortly described. 1.

The first row approximates the edges of the mucous membrane, and the knots are as far as possible tied inside the bowel. The second row includes the serous and muscular coats, and is passed after the manner of Lembert's suture above described (Figs. 326, 327). MacCormac looks upon the inner row of sutures as unnecessary, and advises the use of a single row of Lembert's sutures only.

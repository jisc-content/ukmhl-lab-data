TREATMENT OF CATARRHAL INFLAMMATION. 237 absence of fever may possibly be accounted for by the fact that the exudation drains away from the surface and but little finds its way back into the blood- stream. Parts which have suffered from chronic catarrh, or from repeated attacks of the acute form, usually become more or less pigmented, and the sub-mucous tissue is thickened aud indurated. These signs are well seen in the mucous membrane of the bladder in cases of old stricture or stone. The treatment of catarrhal inflammation presents little that requires special notice. In the more acute forms warmth and moisture, and above all removal of the discharge and prevention of its decomposition, form the most important means of treatment. Belladonna is often of use locally in dimin- ishing pain and promoting contraction of the small arteries. In chronic catarrh, removal of the secretion and cleanliness with the use of astringents, and antiseptics, such as nitrate of silver, acetate of lead, sulphate of copper or tannin, boric acid, iodoform, &c., form the chief treatment. Any con- stitutional condition such as scrofula or gout must be searched for and treated.

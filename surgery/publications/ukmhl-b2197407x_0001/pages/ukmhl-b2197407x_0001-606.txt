572 SPECIAL FRACTURES. CHAPTEK XXI. SPECIAL FRACTUEES. In consicleriug the special fractures, we shall confine our attention to those of the Bones of the Face, Trunk, and Extremities. Injuries of the Bones of the Head and Spine derive their principal importance from their complication with lesion of the contained orguns ; hence the consideration of these will be deferred to special Chapters. FRACTURES OF THE BONES OF THE FACE. Nasal Bones.—These are usually fractured near their lower ends by direct violence (Fig. 170). There may be no displacement, but more commonly the Fig. 170.—FiiictufP of Nasal JJoiies.

The swelling and ecchymosis that usually attend this injury often render its detection difficult, and interfere with efficient treatment. The depressed bone should be raised with the narrow end of a director by which, guided by the finger outside, the fragment may be forced into proper position. To do this thoroughly it is often necessary to administer an anaesthetic. It may be necessary to insert one blade of a well-padded pair of polypus forceps into the nostril, and seize the depressed fragment between this and the other blade ap- plied externally. Union of the bone takes place very rapidly. It is often moderately firm at the end of a week and solid in two weeks. The nose without being exactly broken is often twisted to one side, more particularly if the organ be naturally long and pointed. This deformity com- pletely alters the expression of the face, often producing a somewhat ludicrous appearance. When recent, and more especially when the patient is young, it

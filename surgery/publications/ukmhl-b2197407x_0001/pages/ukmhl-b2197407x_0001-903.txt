WOUND OF THE THORACIC DUCT. 869 Baron Heinden, who was wounded in battle by a bullet, which escaped beneath the left scapula. From this wound there gradually began to flow an excessive quantity of lymph." In Quincke's case, " the pleural cavity became so full of extravasated lymph that paracentesis had to be performed to prevent sulFoca- tion, from which, indeed, the patient eventually died." Krabbel subsequently recorded the case of a boy in whom the duct was completely torn across by a fracture of the ninth dorsal vertebra, from the passage of an empty coal-truck over the back. Death occurred on the fifth day, and the right pleural cavity was found to be distended with chyle. A doubtful case also occurred to Kirchner, in a girl aged 1), who, fourteen days before, had run violently against a "window parapet.'' A litre of chyle was withdrawn by aspiration from the right pleura, and the patient recovered. Keen, of Philadelphia, has collected four cases, including one of his own, in which the thoracic duct was probably wounded during operations in the neck. In Cheever's case the patient died of shock thirty-six hours after the opera- tion. In Boegehold's case the wound was plugged and the patient recovered. In Phelps's case the point from which the fluid escaped in large quantities was ligatured seven days after the operation, and the patient made an excellent recovery. In the case operated upon by Keen the wound in the duct was closed with fine silk, and recovery followed. Â«

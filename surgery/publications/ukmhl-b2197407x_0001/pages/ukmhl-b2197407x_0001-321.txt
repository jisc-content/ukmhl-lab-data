GRANULATIOX- TISSUE. 289 vtiscularisatiou commences as soon as the inflammation ceases. Wywodzoff has found distinct links commencing to form in a wound in the tongue of a dog forty-eight hours after the infliction of the injury. Probably in a healthy wound the'process is completed by the fifth or sixth day. When fully developed the new vessels are very abundant, much more so than in healthy connective-tissue. We now have, therefore, as the uniting medium, a mass of rounded cells, amongst which ramify innumerable thin-walled capillaries—in short, a thin layer of granulation-tissue. (i ranulation-tissue differs from Fig. !)7.—Granulation-tissue, x 800. A. Suiierficial layer just breaking down into pus ; a, coagulated semi-fluid intercellular .substance; h, i)us-eells. B. Growing layer of granulation-tissue; 6, blood- vessels, imperfectly develojied ; c, granulation-cells ; c', cells with nuclei dividing; (/, homogeneous ground-substance coagulated by the hardening fluid.

The cells which compose it are in many cases some- what larger than white corpuscles, and some may be met with of a brahched form. In a wound uniting by first intention, the repair of the divided epithelium t^kes place early by a growth of the cells of the Malpighian layer. The rounded cells of the granulation-tissue. now become gradually trans- formed into connective-tissue cells ; the first change being the elongation of

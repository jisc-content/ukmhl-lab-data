The shaft is drawn inwards by the pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, and teres major, and upwards and forwards into the axilla, and towards the coracoid process, by the biceps, coraco-brachialis, triceps, and deltoid. The signs of this fracture are sufficiently obvious. The glenoid cavity is filled by the head of the bone, which can be felt in it, but cannot be made to move by rotating the shaft. Below this there is a depression causing some flattening of the shoukler, but there is no prominence of the acromion; crepitus is easily produced if extension be made to bring the rough surfaces in contact, and there is great mobility of the lower fragment, with shortening

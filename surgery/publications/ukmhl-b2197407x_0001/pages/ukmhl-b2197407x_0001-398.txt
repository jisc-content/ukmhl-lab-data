3^4 GUN-SIIOr ]VOUNDS. from photographs in the possession of the Army Medical Department at Washington, represents six inches of the shaft of the humerus with its head, which had heen thus excised ; and Fig. 112, the arm that was left. I saw the man, who is an orderly in that unrivalled collection, the Army Medical Museum at Washington, and I can testify to the utility of his arm; the bone so skilfully taken away he himself exhibited. Excision of the ivrist, in whole or in part, for gun-shot injury has not proved very satisfactory, not so much from death as from inutihty of the hand that was left. Of 27 done in the American war, only 3 died. In two instances, amputation of the forearm was practised. Gurlt has collected 133 cases with 112 recoveries, 20, or 15*15 per cent, deaths, and 1 uncertain. The steps of all the operations are the same, whether the excision of the Fig. 111. part be required for gun-shot injury, or for disease ; except that in gun-shot injury advantage may often be taken of the wound in the soft parts, by en- larging which longitudinally, the shattered bone may be readily reached. The question as to the period at lohkh amputation ought to be performed aftev the infliction of gun-shot wounds, is one of great importance, and has given rise to much discussion among Surgeons. The older military Surgeons, Pare, Wiseman, Ledran, Ranby, &c., taking a common-sense view of the question, advocated the removal of the hopelessly injured limb as soon as possible after the receipt of the injury. Wiseman's advice is to " cut off the limb quickly, while the soldier is heated and in mettle ; " and this advice has not been and cannot be improved upon. After the battle of Fontenoy, in the middle of the last century, professional opinion underwent a change upon this subject ; and Faure wrote a thesis, which obtained a prize from the French Academy of Surgery, recommending delay in amputating in certain cases.

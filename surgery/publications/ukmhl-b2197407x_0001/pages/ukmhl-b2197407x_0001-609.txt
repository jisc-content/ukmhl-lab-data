If the bone happen to be broken on both sides of this hne, the middle fragment is much dragged out of place by the depressor muscles attached to it; indeed, in all double fractures, the displacement is very great, in tractuie about the angle and lower part of the ramus, the deformity is not so great, owing to the muscles that coat and protect each side of the bone in this situa- tion preventing the fragments from being displaced. When the neck ot the condyle is broken through, that process is often much displaced by the action Fig. 17-2.—Fracture of Lower .law.

When the fracture is near the symphysis, the dental canal escapes; but when it is further back in the body of the bone, and especially near the angle, the canal must necessarily be imphcated. It is remarkable, however, that the inferior dental nerve escapes injury or division in many cases altoo-ether, in others for several days, until, perhaps, owing to great displace- ment or to some effort in reduction, it may be torn across. AVhen this happens, the soft parts of the lower lip, supplied by the mental branch of the inferior dental, are necessarily for a time deprived of sensation, but they soon recover. I have never known any permanent mischief from this cause, nor from the hasmorrhage following laceration of the inferior dental artery. The Treatment is simple in principle, but often not easy of accomplisli- ment. It consists in maintaining the parts in apposition for four or five weeks, during which time mastication must be forbidden—tlie patient living

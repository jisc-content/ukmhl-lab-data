888 INJURIES OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS. was first recommended by Jobert in 1822. His method is illustrated in the accompanying diagrams (Fig. 333, 834). Senn has recommended a very similar method ; instead of the bone tube an india-rubber ring is stitched with catgut into the proximal end of the bowel, before the invagination is made.

All the above methods of intestinal suture have been successfully employed, but at the present time it is impossible to decide which is likely to be found the most generally useful. The first two methods have the advantage of requiring no special apparatus. The Czerny-Lembert suture or some modification of it is easy to apply and has given excellent results. Objection has been raised to Maunsell's method that the sutures pass through all the coats of the bowel. The risk of leakage along the sutures is small if horsehair be used as recommended by Maunsell, whilst Fig. 334.—The Suture Tightened.

Suture introduced to give ad- ditional security. it may be advisable to insert a few additional points of Lembert suture as suggested by Stanley Boyd, who has successfully employed the methods Senn's method of so-called " lateral anastomosis" by the use of decalcified bone plates does not appear to present any special advantages in the suture of two segments of intestine of the same calibre (see Chap. LXIV.). In any case of intestinal suture additional security may be attained by adjusting an omental graft over the line of the sutures, as suggested by Senn. The sutured intestine is carefully cleansed and replaced in the abdomen,

Polypus of the uterus is a fibro-myoma, and polypus of the rectum often a papilloma, and sometimes a form of cancer. Simple polypi are usually covered by a prolonga- tion of the mucous membrane from which they grow. Thus the muco'js poly- pus of the nose is covered by a membrane bearing ciliated epithelium, Gr. Adenoma. Glandular Tumours.—These tumours resemble secreting Fig. 375.—Aflenoiiia (adeiio-.sarc^oiiia) of Mamma, rapid growth (18S diam.). This is Sfniietiiues spoken of as adeno-sareoma; tlie epithelium in the acini is arranged in several layers, the stroma contains many oval cells and some fibres. glands in structure. Secreting glands are racemose or tubular, and conse- quently adenomata are divided into two corresponding classes.

366 GUK-SHOT WOUNDS. of "shock" have come on, it then becomes a question whether immediate amputation should be practised, or the removal of the limb delayed until reaction sets in. On this point it is obviously diflBcult to lay down any very definite rule ; but it may, I think, be stated generally as the result of the experience of the best Army Surgeons, that, if the shock be not very intense, the limb may, under an anesthetic, be safely removed. Should the prostration be excessive, and there be reason to fear the possibility of internal injury, it will be wiser to delay operation. But if an unsuccessful attempt at the pre- servation of the limb be made, and if occasion for its subsequent removal should arise, the Surgeon must wait until suppuration has set in before he operates, the period of acute inflammation and septic fever being allowed to pass by. The most favourable time is usually about the tenth day. Among the cases that require secondary amputation, are any in which traumatic gangrene may happen to set in ; here the limb must always be removed with- out delay. If profuse hemorrhage from the wound occur, and do not admit of arrest by the ordinary means, secondary amputation may become necessary. So, also, when the bones do not unite, the patient being worn out by profuse discharge kept up by the presence of necrosed or carious bone, or left with a wasted, shattered, and useless limb, its removal is the only means of saving life. The high death-rate after secondary amputation in military practice is, in great measure, due to the unfavourable hygienic conditions to which the wounded soldier is usually exposed from overcrowding and want of necessary appliances. He is thus rendered peculiarly liable to be attacked by pyemia, septicemia, and hospital gangrene. The nature and treatment of gun-shot injuries of special regions, as of the head, chest, and abdomen, will be considered in the Chapters devoted to the description of Injuries of those parts.

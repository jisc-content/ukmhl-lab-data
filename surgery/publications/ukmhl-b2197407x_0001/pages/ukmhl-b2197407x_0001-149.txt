AMPUTATION THROUGH THE TARSUS. 117 troublesome, on account of the irregularity of the line of articulation ; hence it is better to saw through the metatarsus just in front of the tarsal articula- tions. A combination of these two procedures may sometimes be advantage- ously adopted; as by disarticulation of the first metatarsal bone, and sawing the rest anterior to their articulations. Tn many cases the best result will be Fig. 0?.â€”B. Line of Key's, or Tarso-Met;i- tarsal Aiiipututioii. A. Line of Clioiiart's, or Meclio-Tarsal Amputation. Fig. .j8.--Chopait's Operation. Flap formed before Di.sarticulation. obtained by simply dissecting back the sole of the foot, clearing the bones and sawing them across at a convenient line. ' Amputation through the Tarsus may conveniently be performed by Chopart's, or the medio-tarsal, operation, which consists in disarticulation in the Ime between the os calcis and astragalus behind, and the cuboid and scaphoid m front (Fig. 57). This operation may be performed in two ways either by first making the flap from the sole of the foot, and then disarticu- lating (Fig. 58); or, the joints having been cut through from the dorsum the flap may afterwards be made (Fig. 60). In the latter plan, a smoother end will be obtained by transfixing the flap as in Figure 60, and cutting it in two parts from the middle. I prefer the first plan, as it enables the Surgeon to make a more correctly fashioned flap.

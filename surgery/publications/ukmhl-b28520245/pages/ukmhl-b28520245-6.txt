4 S1TRGT?T^Y IN BENGAL. as an equally good illustration of the opportunities afforded, and the mode in which they are taken advantage of, I might adduce a recent donation of 17 large vesical calculi, presented to the College Museum by a gi-aduate whose degree is not yet a year old, removed by him, at the station of Pind Daduu Khan, within six months after joining his appointment. And I might refer to the names of O^Sliaughnessy, Brett, Wel)b, Playfair, Naisraith, Aiteheson, Partridge, Cayley and other’s, as of Surgeons who have had expei’ience in this operation, that scarcely the Frdre Jaques, Rau, or Cheseklen ever exceeded. If you will bear in mind the details I give you from the Official Records, you will see that though little may have been said on the subject, much really has been done. And as in the case of lithotomy, so it is in other matters surgical; the scrotal tumours, for example, of which the Hospitals in Lower Bengal record operations by the score. Tumours of vast magnitude removed with safety and celerity in a few minutes, the important parts involved being preserved and uninjured— a strange contrast to the descriptions still to be read in standard works on Surgery, of protracted and dangerous operations, involving, not only loss of parts, but sometimes of life. Though here I should remark, the operation has been recently performed by a Surgeon in England in the method recommended by Indian Surgeons, among the earliest of whom was, I believe, the late Surgeon Brett. Now, it is not for the purpose of animadverting on others that I say this, for to do so would be unjust; but rather to put it before you how desirable it is that we should assert for ourselves a more prominent position in the published records of our science and give our experiences to the world. It is to a Society like that I am now addressing, that we should look for the removal of this reflection on our profes- sional zeal; it is here, or in the pages of the Journal which I hope ere long will be published, that we may hope to hear, or read, valuable matter discussed, and thus preserved from oblivion. To me, the interest and importance of this Society have always presented themselves from the highest point of view, and I most earnestly call upon our native professional brethren to give it their support, not only by their subscrip- tions and presence at the meetings, but by the contribution

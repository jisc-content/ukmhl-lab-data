27 SURGERY IN BENGAL. Post Mortem.—^th December, 9 a. m.—Abdominal viscera^ liver, spleen, and Iddneys, healthy. Thorax.—Pleurae contained turbid puriform serum, anterior surface of lung" quite healthy in appearance; posterior por- tion of lung deeply congested; the left pulmonic pleura thickened, and covered with dense deeply yellow colored lymph of a puriform appearance. Lungs, chiefly posterior portions, full of patches of dead tissue, and in some places, where deeply congested, drops of pus oozed out on section and pressure; but these were inde- pendent of the dead patches. The lungs, en masse, floated in water, though the portions containing the white patches sunk. I examined them carefully under the microscope and could detect only broken down granular matter and lung tissue, (vide Sketch) no pus, or only a few globules, and these shrivelled and imperfectly developed. The patches to which I have referred were numerous, from the size of a pea to that of a rupee, and when cut into, presented a dead white appearance, with a foetid sanious fluid exuding; in some there were granular cells, pus or altered white corpuscles, and round them, in certain cases, a dark areola of congested lung tissue, and in some instances, those, I presume, of longest standing, there was pus, the result of suppuration, set up by the irritation of the pre- sence of the dead tissue, just as in the case of an ordinary boil, where the dead piece of areolar tissue (the core) is thrown off by suppuration taking place around it.

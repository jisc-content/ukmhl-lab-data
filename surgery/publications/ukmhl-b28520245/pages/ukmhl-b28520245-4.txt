SURGERY IN BENGAL. still much has been done, and is doing, as I hope to show; a knowledge, of which I would fain hope to see this Asso- ciation the exponent. It appears to me remarkable how little the subject of Surgery in India has attracted attention in the West, how little seems to have been drawn from a mine so rich in produce. This may be, no doubt, to a great extent attributed to the isolated and scattered position of the medical men in this great country, and to the paucity of Indian Journals on Medical Science in which they might make their labours known. But yet no one can turn to the pages of the Journal of the late Medical and Physical Society of Bengal, the “ Pathologia Indica'’^ of the late lamented Allan Webb, or the works of Brett, Martin, Twining, Chevers, Morehead, Carter, and others, as well as to the “ Indian Annals of Medical Science/^ or the Journals of Madras and Bombay, without being convinced that India has fairly contributed its share to the Annals of Surgery and Pathology. And this, indeed, is not more than should be expected; for to few have been given the like opportunities of dealing with disease, surgical or medical, on so large a scale, as to the British Surgeons who have spent their best years and energies in India, or to those native gentlemen who have so thoroughly grasped the Science of Medicine, as it is taught in Europe, and who have learned to practise with success the boldest operations in surgery. Isolated, cut off from professional communion with his fellows, deprived of that stimulus of contact and intercourse, which is so essential to the growth of seientifie knowledge, especially in a profession like ours, where so much depends on observation and interchange of our ideas with those of others, no wonder if the young surgeon, in the midst of a large experience, should have failed sometimes to profit to the fullest extent by his great advantages; to the extent, that is to say, he would have done, had he been in a position to talk over his cases and compare his ideas with those of his professional brethren. Such is but too frequently the case with both Native and European Surgeon in the Mofussil of India, and such, no doubt, is the reason why so little is known of his work. And

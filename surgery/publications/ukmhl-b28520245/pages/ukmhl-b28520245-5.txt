3 SURGERY IN BENGAL. and had my address no other result than that of directing attention to this subject, I should think it had fulfilled a good purpose. By the kindness of the Medical Authorities I have been enabled to collect some interesting matter in a statistical form, illustrative of the extent to which Surgery is practised in India; and I feel sure that, whether for the amount of sufier- ing relieved, or the extent of valuable information contri- buted to science, you will agree with me that it is not less interesting than valuable, and that it is, moreover, highly suggestive of the vast acquisitions that might be made to our Pathological and Surgical knowledge, were the details more thoroughly known, and the records of many years analysed. Most of my hearers, I suppose, are familiar with the standard works of Europe, at all events of Britain, on Surgery ; most of them, no doubt, are acquainted with the writings of modern Surgeons and Pathologists, on the more interesting subjects connected with those Sciences ; and yet I will venture to say that you would have difficulty in adducing even a casual reference, in any of the standard works professing to treat exhaustively of their respective subjects, to the authority, practice, or opinion of one Indian Surgeon. Let us take the operation of lithotomy, for example. The most elaborate description of all points, pathological, anato- mical, chemical, or surgical, concerned in the disease for which, this operation is performed; the fullest details, statistical and descriptive, of the proceedings and opinions of British and Continental Surgeons of eminence, who have been inter- ested in, or distinguished for, their investigation or skill in operating for this grievous disease; every fact, in short, that could be collected, carefully collated aud recorded, yet, not a word on the subject as it relates to India, where we count our operations by hundreds, I may say, and where some of our graduates have cut as many men successfully for stone as the greatest lithotomists Europe ever saw. Let me not be charged with exaggeration; I may refer to my friend Baboo Ram Narain^s experience, who, within a period of 12 years, in the Stations of Cawnpore and Buda6n operated upwards of 200 times with a loss of 7 cases.

149 INTUBATION index-finger until its upper end rests on tlie upper margin of the glottis. The index-finger is kept on the tube while the introducer is being with- drawn. The tube is known to be in the larynx by the fact that the air passes in and out through it. The silk thread is fastened to the cheek by strapping, or tied round one of the ears. In cases of diphtheria, the tube should not be left in more than a few days ; when it is being used as a dilator it may have to be worn for months. The patient should be carefully watched for some time after the introduc- tion of the tube in case difficulty in breathing should arise, as it may be necessary to remove the tube and perform tracheotomy. If the tube enters the oesophagus, it is easily extracted by traction on the silk thread. To prevent it from falling into the lower air-passages, as large a tube as will fit the larynx should be used. Should such an accident happen, the tube must be extracted by the means detailed in Chapter XI. It is not uncommon for the tube to be expelled by coughing or vomiting, and in diphtheria it may become blocked by the membrane. Under these circumstances it must be removed at once. In order to remove the tube, the child is held in the same manner as during its introduction, and the closed blades of the extractor are passed into the upper end of the tube. The blades are then opened and kept open, so as to exercise pressure on the circumference of the lumen of the tube whilst the extractor is withdrawn. The tube may also be removed by pulling on the string, guided by the left forefinger passed down to the upper end of the tube. The question of intubation ov tracheotomy for diplitheria has been much

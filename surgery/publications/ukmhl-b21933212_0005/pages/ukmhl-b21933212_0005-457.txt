AFFECTIONS OF THE VESICUL^ SEMINALES 425 peritonitis and tuberculous cystitis are apt to follow extension of the disease in this region, whilst the prostate almost invariably becomes involved. TREATMENT.â€”The surgical treatment is hmitedto cases in which suppuration has occurred, although some surgeons have removed tuber- culous vesiculae seminales before suppuration has taken place. It is doubtful whether an operation of this kind should ever be performed, as it must be very extensive, and the affection is usually secondary, and therefore does not warrant it. As soon as suppuration is evident in the neighbourhood of the vesiculae seminales, a perineal incision should be made and the surgeon should gradually separate the tissues behind the prostate until the abscess is reached and evacuated by the perineum, thus avoiding the risk of its bursting into the rectum or the bladder. The procedure is similar to that for tuberculous disease of the prostate (see p. 407), except that the separation must be carried farther up between the prostate and the rectum until the abscess cavity is reached.

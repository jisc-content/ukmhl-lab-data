AFFECTIONS OF THE TESTIS 290 When the testicle merely lies in the crural canal, the organ can be replaced in position by opening up the inguinal canal, pulling the testis out of the crural canal, and placing it in the scrotum in the maimer recommended for an imperfectly descended organ. The craral canal will then be closed in the usual manner (see Vol. IV. p. 496).

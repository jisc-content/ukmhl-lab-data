477 CHAPTER XLVII. TUMOURS OF THE BLADDER. Tumours are not uncommon in the bladder ; they may be shnple or mahgnant, and they may arise from any of the structures composing the bladder. BENIGN TUMOURS. Papilloma, or ' villous tumour of the bladder,' is common, and i:^ generally benign, although it may grow on a malignant base. Two forms are met with: the tyiie villous tumour of the bladder with long thread-like processes, and sessile warty groioihs. The villous tumours are composed of long filiform processes of connective tissue supporting blood-vessels and covered by epithelium. The growths are pedunculated, bleed with extreme readiness, and are often multiple. It is very common, on opening a bladder for a growth of this kind, to find one large villous mass with a number of smaller ones around. It would almost seem that they are locally infective, for, if a villous tumour is left unoperated upon, the bladder may become studded with little villous masses, and recurrence after operation is not at all uncommon. The fresh tumour does not always appear at the site of the original one, but may form in the neighbourhood, and be apparently a fresh development rather than a true recurrence. The warty papillomata are not so common and are firmer and bleed less readily. Fibromata, myxomata, myomata, and angiomata have been met with in the bladder ; the last of these are amongst the rarest, only two or three cases having been reported. We have had a case in which the left side of the bladder was occupied by an angiomatous growth, the only symptom being haemorrhage, without any indication as to its true source, and so profuse that no satisfactory cystoscopic examination could be carried out. The diagnosis of a naevus of the bladder was made

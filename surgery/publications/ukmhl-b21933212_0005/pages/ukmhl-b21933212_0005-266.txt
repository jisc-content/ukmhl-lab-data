234 AFFECTIONS OF THE THORAX ought not to be reduced more than 4 mm. to 5 mm. of mercury. The temperature of the air in the chamber should be from 75" to 80*^ F. POSITIVE PRESSURE METHODS. The arrangements for positive pressure are rather more complicated and require the use of a receptacle into which the patient's head is Fig. 58.—Willy Meyer's Universal Dm i erential Chamber. The cabinet receives tlie head of the patient, who lies on the operating-table in the larger room. He can thus receive the anesthetic under increased pressure—positive pressure—or he can receive it under normal atmospheric pressure while the rest of his body in the large chamber can be under decreased pressure—negative pressure. (Garre and Quincke.) inserted (see Fig. 59), except where Willy Meyer's arrangement can be carried out and a small chamber provided in which the pressure can be raised to the necessary degree (about 7 mm. of mercury).

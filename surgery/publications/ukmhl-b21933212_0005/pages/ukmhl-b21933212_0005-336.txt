CHAPTER XXX. 304 SYPHILITIC AFFECTIONS OF THE TESTIS : TUMOURS OF THE TESTIS : HERNIA TESTIS. SYPHILIS. The testis may be attacked either in the congenital or the acquired form of the disease ; in the latter case the affection usually occurs in the transition period between the secondary and the tertiary stages or late in the latter stage. In the congenital form and in the early tertiary stages the disease generally takes the form of an infiltration of the testis leading to a comparatively painless general enlargement of the body with loss of testicular sensation and, unless it is treated early and efficiently, loss of function results. This condition is usually associated with hydrocele, and when there is a hydrocele present in conjunction with enlargement of the body of the testis it is strong presumptive evidence that the affection is syphilitic. Gummata are also met with in the later stages of syphilis, either deep in the substance of the organ or upon the tunica albuginea or in both situations, and these give rise to a hard nodular testis which may also be accompanied by hydrocele although not so frequently as the other form. Gummata may also occur in the epididymis, although much more rarely than in the body of the testis, indeed, gummata may even be met with in the epididymis alone, when they usually occur in the globus major ; gummata have also been met with on the vas above the epididymis, but these conditions are rare. A gumma of the testis if left untreated softens and breaks down, becoming adherent to the skin, wliich is thinned and gives way, so that a large gummatous ulcer with a sloughy base is formed. As the gumma in most cases finds its way through the tunica albuginea this ulceration is frequently followed by a hernia testis (see p. 305). TREATMENT.â€”The treatment of syphiUtic testicle is that for syphilis in general (see Vol. I. Chap. XL). Little local treatment is

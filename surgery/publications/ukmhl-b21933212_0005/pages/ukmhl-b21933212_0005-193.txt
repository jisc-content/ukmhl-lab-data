DIVISION III. THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE BREAST AND THORAX. SECTION I.^AFFECTIONS OF THE BREAST. CHAPTER XIV. DEFORMITIES, INJURIES, INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND SYPHILIS OF THE BREAST. DEFORMITIES. The only congenital deformity of the breast amenable to surgical treat- ment is the so-called ' umbiJicated nipple ' ; a similar malformation may arise after puberty when a large amount of fat develops in the breast. In this condition the nip- ple lies buried at the bottom of a circular fossa, and in marked cases may give rise to much trouble from the accumulation of dirt, epithe- lium, and secretion. As a rule, however, the depression is not great and the deformity only re- quires treatment because of the possible difficulty in suckling. TREATMENT—The minor forms of this condition can be remedied by removing a crescentic area of skin on each side of the nipple, with its concavity towards the latter and sufficiently wide to obliterate the fossa between the skin and V. l6l M Fig. 41.—Plastic Operation for • Umbili- CA.TED Nipple." The crescentic shaded areas re- present tlie portions of skin removed. The inner and outer edges of the crescents are sewn together.

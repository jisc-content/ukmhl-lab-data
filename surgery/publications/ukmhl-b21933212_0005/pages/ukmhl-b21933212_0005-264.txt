232 CHAPTER XIX. OPERATIONS ON THE LUNGS UNDER DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE. Recently, the surgery of the thorax has been greatly advanced and altered by the introduction of what are called the ' differential pressure ' methods. These are based on the fact that the thorax in the normal state acts under negative pressure, but that when it is opened the air passing in from outside produces a condition of equilibrium, the elastic tissue of the lung contracts, the lung collapses, and no expansion takes place on inspiration. Hence it is a very serious matter to open the pleural cavity on one side, and practically fatal to open both sides. The ' differential pressure ' methods aim at preventing this collapse of the lung and at enabling the surgeon to open one or even both pleural cavities without a fatal result. There are two chief methods by which the occurrence of coUapse of the lung on opening a healthy chest may be prevented. The first is the ' negative pressure ' method, which consists in taking steps to maintain a negative pressure around the thorax after the chest has been opened ; this is the plan of which Sauerbruch is the chief exponent. The other is the ' positive pressure ' method, which has been especially worked out by Brauer, in which the pressure of the air within the lungs is increased, so as to prevent their collapse when the ordinary atmospheric air is admitted into the thorax from without. NEGATIVE PRESSURE METHODS. The method by which negative pressure is obtained is by the con- struction of a chamber around the body of the patient in which the atmospheric pressure can be diminished, while the head is not included in the chamber, and therefore the air in the lung is rmder the ordinary pressure. This chamber must be large enough to allow room for the operator and his assistant, and the smaller ones must have a smaller

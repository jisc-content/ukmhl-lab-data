238 AFFECTIONS OF THE THORAX Meltzer showed that even when both sides of the chest were opened in animals, sufficient aeration of the lungs was obtained if air was blown into the lungs at a pressure of 20 mm. of mercury through a tube passed down through the larynx to the bifurcation of the trachea. This plan has been employed to a considerable extent, and with some surgeons it has taken the place of the other methods to which we have just referred. Meltzer's original apparatus is quite simple, and is practically identical with the apparatus devised by Boyle and Gask and shown in Fig. 62. Elsberg of New York has constructed a more B Fig. 62.â€”Boyle and Cask's Intra-tracheal An/esthetic Apparatus. Air is driven from the bellows, A, through hot water in the bottle, C (the tap, B, is for air, and Bi s a reserve tap for oxygen if necessary). The air then passes through E, over the surface of the ether in the smaller bottle, and so on to the gum-elastic catheter, F. When it is desirable to give air without ether, E, Er are turned off and G is turned on. By regulating these taps, it is easy to have the whole or part of the air laden with ether vapour. The manometer, D, registers the pressure under which the air is driven into the trachea. elaborate apparatus on the same principle, which can be moved about, and which is described and figured in Vol. IV. p. 34. The patient is first anaesthetised, and then a silk catheter about 24 French gauge is passed through the glottis until it is about an inch and a half above the bifurcation of the trachea. The catheter varies in size with the age of the patient, and should only be about half the calibre of the trachea, so that the air can readily escape alongside it. The chief trouble in the method is the introduction of the tube into the glottis ; in order to avoid carrying in septic material with the tube its introduction is best effected by the aid of a Killian's or Jackson's direct laryngoscope.

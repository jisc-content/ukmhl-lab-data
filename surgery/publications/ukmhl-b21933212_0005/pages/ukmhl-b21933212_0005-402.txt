AFFECTIONS OF THE URETHRA 370 and does not enter the membranous urethra. All that now remains is to raise the handle to the vertical, and then to depress it between the thighs so as to pass the prostatic urethra. This is the so-called ' demi-tour de maitre.' (c) The third method, which is sometimes of value in attempting to pass an instrument through a narrow stricture, is the so-called complete ' tour de maitre ' (see Fig. loi). In it the instrument is passed, as in b, until the point is as far down the bulb as it will go. Instead of rotating the instrument up to the middle line it is now rotated downwards between the thighs, then across the opposite thigh, and then from that point to d Fig. ioi.—^The ' Tour de Maitre.' The arrows denote the course taken by the handle of the instrument from a to d. the middle line. During the whole manoeuvre care is taken to keep the point well pressed down in contact with the stricture. This plan has the advantage that it brings the point of the instmment into contact with various portions of the stricture in succession, and therefore it may at some point slip through the opening in it. If no stricture exists, a No. 12 English bougie wiU pass easily into the bladder—at any rate, after a little steady pressure—when introduced by either of the first two methods mentioned, provided always that it wiU pass through the external meatus, and that no attempt is made to push it on towards the bladder before the point is properly engaged in the membranous urethra. If on the other hand a stricture is present, the instrument will be arrested at that point. The surgeon must then determine whether the obstruction is due to an organic stricture or

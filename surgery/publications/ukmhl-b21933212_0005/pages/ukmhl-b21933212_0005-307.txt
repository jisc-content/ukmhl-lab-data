275 EPITHELIOMA cavernosa at right angles to the long axis of the penis on a level with the base of the flap. A few touches of the knife will suffice to separate the corpus spongiosum from the divided corpora cavernosa, and the former is divided half an inch in front of the base of the flap, cutting cleanly down on to the instrument in the urethra, which is then removed. A pair of catch-forceps is applied to the cut end of the urethra, the tourniquet is removed, and all bleeding is arrested. Bleeding vessels are generally f(jund in the centre of each corpus cavernosum, while the dorsal artery of the penis will require ligature on each side, as will also those in the septum Fiij. 68.â€”."Vmpuiation of the Penis. / shows tlic tourniquet applied, the catheter in position, and the flap marked out; this flap is reflected in //. In /// the dorsal incision has been made and the knife is transfixing the organ between the corpus spongiosum and tlie corpora cavernosa preparatory to dividing the latter. This lias been done in IV where a hole has been made in the flap (or the urethra which is in the act of being divided. V shows the stump sutmed. between the corpora cavernosa ; these may be difficult to seize and may require fine-pointed or ' mosquito ' artery-forceps. When the bleeding has been arrested, a small vertical slit is made in the centre of the flap, and through this the end of the urethra is drawn. The flap is now stitched to the skin on the dorsum, and the orifice of the urethra is secured to the aperture in the flap. It is necessary to see that this is larger than the normal cahbre of the urethra, so as to aUow for contraction during heaUng, and this is best done by slitting up the urethra for a short distance upon its upper and lower surfaces and care fully stitching the edges to the opening in the flap.

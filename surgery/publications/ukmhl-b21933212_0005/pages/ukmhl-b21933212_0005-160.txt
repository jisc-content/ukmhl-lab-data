CHAPTER XI. 128 FOREIGN BODIES IN THE PHARYNX OR AIR-PASSAGES. Foreign bodies may cause dyspnoea or actual asphyxia, whether they lodge in the pharynx about the upper aperture of the larynx or enter the air-passages proper. FOREIGN BODIES IN THE PHARYNX. Foreign bodies lodging in the pharynx and causing difficulty of breathing are usually of large size, such as masses of food or toothplates. These interfere with respiration mechanically and a sudden and fatal asphyxia may result unless prompt and effectual treatment be adopted. TREATMENT.â€”In all cases in which the patient becomes suddenly asphyxiated, either during eating or vomiting, the first thing to be done is to force open the jaws ; if no gag is at hand, the handle of a knife, a spoon, or any other convenient article, should be introduced between the teeth, and the jaws levered apart. The finger is then pushed well back into the pharnyx and swept round the orifice of the larynx in search of the foreign body which is causing the obstruction. If it is situated outside the air-passages proper, it can generally either be pulled up with the finger or pushed down into the oesophagus. When the obstruction is not easily dislodged, laryngotomy must be performed immediately (see p. 143) in order to save the patient's life. The patient may begin to breathe as soon as the laryngotomy is done, but when this is not the case, artificial respiration should be commenced, and when breathing has been re-established, the surgeon can proceed to extract the foreign body. This should be done with forceps bent at a right angle, the throat being illuminated by a frontal mirror. When the foreign body is a toothplate, the chief obstacles to removal are the sharp hooks which catch in the tissues ; these may be so firmly impacted that it is necessary to break up the plate with cutting-forceps before it

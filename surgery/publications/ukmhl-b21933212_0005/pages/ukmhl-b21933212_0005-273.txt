CHAPTER XX. THE INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS OF THE LUNGS AMENABLE TO SURGICAL TREATMENT. The inflammatory affections of the lungs which are amenable to surgical treatment are : acute abscesses and gangrene, more chronic non-tuberculous abscesses, bronchiectasis, and tuberculous vomicae. ACUTE ABSCESS AND GANGRENE. These may take the form of simple acute abscesses in the lung substance—generally near the surface of the lower lobe—or of putrid abscesses with gangrene of the lung around. Simple abscesses are rare, but occasionally occur in cases of croupous pneumonia ; not uncommonly localised collections of pus in the pleura —especially between the lobes—are mistaken for abscesses in the lung. These abscesses very soon communicate with the bronchi, and the pus is discharged through the air-passages, and healing may occur in this way. When there is no reason to suspect gangrene {e.g. no putrid dis- charge or expectoration of gangrenous shreds) some time—three to ten weeks—may be allowed to elapse before the question of operation need be urgently considered. If, however, healing does not occur, or if the sputum becomes putrid, surgical intervention becomes necessary, other- wise the patient will go downhill as the result of septic absorption and the insufficient drainage of the abscess and its extension in various directions in the lung. The diagnosis and localisation of these abscesses is very difficult, and on this point medical works must be consulted; the majority are situated low down—especially at the posterior part— and, as a general rule, the exploratory opening of the thorax should be made at the back of the chest below the angle of the scapula. A radiogram may be of vakie not only in localising the abscess, but also in showing the state of the rest of the lung. Operation.—All these operations should be performed under differential

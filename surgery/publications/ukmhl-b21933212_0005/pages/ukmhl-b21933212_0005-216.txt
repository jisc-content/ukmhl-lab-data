AFFECTIONS OF THE BREAST i84 After the flaps have been dissected up to the extent described, the next point is to detach the costo-sternal attachment of the pectoralis major. For this purpose the skin at the upper part of the wound is retracted and the fat that has been left over the clavicular fibres of the pectoralis major is dissected downwards from the muscle, until the sternal attach- ment is reached. The muscle is then split with the handle of the knife, in the direction of its fibres, at the junction of these two component parts, and the surgeon slips his hand into the cleft thus formed and lifts up Fig. 52.â€”Amputation of the Breast for Carcinoma. Culling Ihe poslerior flap. This is dissected back so as to expose the latissimus dorsi muscle. the costo-sternal portion of the muscle, putting its fibres on the stretch ; the inner margin of the incision is retracted and the sternal attachment of the muscle divided close to the bone, from above downwards. As each fasciculus of the muscle is divided, the anterior branches of the internal mammary artery come into view, and it is usually possible to clamp these before they are cut, thus avoiding a great deal of haemor- rhage. When this part of the pectoralis major has been divided, the incision is carried downwards over the upper part of the rectus and the external oblique muscles, and the fascia covering the upper part of these muscles is dissected up and left attached to the breast.

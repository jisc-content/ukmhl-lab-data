AFFECTIONS OF THE SPLEEN 66 The spleen is best exposed through a vertical incision through the outer edge of the left rectus from the costal margin to well below the umbilicus. The incision must be large enough to allow the organ to be delivered through it without the least traction. The spleen is first examined to see if there are any extensive adhesions ; if there are, the operation is contra-indicated because of the danger from the oozing which will persist after the wound is closed. When there are no extensive adhesions the spleen is delivered through Fig. 17.â€”^Transverse Section of the Abdominal Cavity, to show the arrange- ment OF the ligaments of the Spleen and the course of its blood-vessels. (Moynihan, in A System of Operative Surgery, edited by F. F. Burgliard.) the wound so that it lies upon the surface of the abdomen, and the remainder of the operation is performed outside the abdominal cavity. The greatest gentleness must be used in delivering the spleen, otherwise it may be torn and fatal hemorrhage may easily occur; the wound must be enlarged as much as may be necessary to allow of the easiest manipulation. In particular, traction upon the pedicle must be avoided, as the splenic vein is readily torn and traction may also cause profound shock from disturbance of the sympathetic plexuses. Before the organ is drawn out of the wound, the position of the pedicle must be noted so that the surgeon can at once control it should any accident occur. Fig. 17 shows the position of the spleen and the arrangement of its ligaments.

AFFECTIONS OF THE NECK 82 proceeds with the treatment of the wound. When the vessels have been tied, the condition of the nerves must be investigated, and if any have been divided, they should be sutured if possible. If the base of the epiglottis has been cut across, it should be fastened in position by two or three catgut stitches. The soft tissues connecting the hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage should then be sutured as accurately as possible ; when the incision is higher up, the muscles of the base of the tongue must be united. If the wound has penetrated the pharynx it is well to insert a small drainage tube ; if not, a tube is not necessary. When the air-passages are involved.—^The following points have to be considered : The arrest of haemorrhage, the prevention of asphyxia, the treatment of the opening into the air-passages, and the measures necessarj^ to avoid subsequent complications such as cellulitis and broncho-pneumonia. When the patient is first seen, the two most urgent points to be attended to are the arrest of hcemorrhage and the prevention of asphyxia. If the respiration is embarrassed, either from the passage of blood down the air-passages or from obstruction to the larynx by the tongue falling back, the first thing is to apply firm sponge pressure to the wound so as to arrest the bleeding temporarily, and then to open the trachea. As soon as this has been done, the patient's head should be lowered, and the opening in the trachea held wide apart so as to facilitate the escape of blood ; this may be further aided by tickling the trachea with a feather. When the clots have been coughed up, a tracheotomy tube should be introduced—and this should be a Hahn's (see Fig. 21, A) or a Trendelenburg's tube (see Fig. 21, B), if one is at hand—so as to shut off the air-passages and prevent the further entrance of blood, whilst the surgeon is attending to the wound. Should neither of these tubes be

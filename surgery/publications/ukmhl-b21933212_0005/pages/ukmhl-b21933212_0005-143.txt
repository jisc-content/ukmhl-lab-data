GOlTRE III do not enter the lobe in one or two main trunks, as is the case with the superior thyroid, but break up into a number of branches scattered over the lower part of the posterior surface, where they can be easily isolated, clamped close to the gland, and divided. If the isolation of the lobe has been carried out by peeling off the structures from the posterior surface quite close to the capsule of the gland from above downwards, it should be easy to make certain that neither the oesophagus nor the recurrent laryngeal nerve is damaged. With the upper part of the lobe the recurrent laryngeal has no connection, and if everything is cleared steadily backwards and downwards from it towards the oesophagus, the nerve must go with the structures peeled off. As the detachment Fig. 27.â€”Dislocation of the lateral lobe in Right-sided Thyroidectomy. proceeds, the tummu" is pulled steadily inwards to the middle line and is separated from the trachea. It is a good plan to cut into the gland here, and to leave a considerable portion of the gland tissue at the lower and posterior part of the lobe in all cases. The remainder of the lateral lobe is readily raised from the trachea until the isthmus is reached, and then, according to the necessities of the case, the surgeon may either remove the lobe from the isthmus or may carry his separ- ation a little further, raising the isthmus from the trachea, and finally removing the lobe and the isthmus together, leaving the opposite lobe behind. Here the operator must be cautious, as, if the pressure has been great and has lasted for some time, softening of the rings may have occurred, and damage is easUy done. In descriptions of this operation it is usual to find instructions given for passing a series of ligatures between the isthmus and the lobe in order to prevent the bleeding when the two are separated. We have, however, never found

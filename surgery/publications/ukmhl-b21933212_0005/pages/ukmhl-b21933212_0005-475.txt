443 CHAPTER XLIII. CYSTITIS. Cystitis may be primary in origin or may arise secondarily to inflam- matory conditions of other structures in the immediate vicinity of the bladder ; it may also be acute or chronic. It is most common in adult and advanced life, and is rare in young subjects, the explanation of this fact being that the various diseases so often complicated by cystitis occur chiefly in adult life. All forms of cystitis are due to bacterial infection, and in some this is the sole cause, while in others the disease is a complication of other conditions, such as stricture or enlarged prostate. The organisms producing it most frequently enter through the urethra, one of the commonest sources being the passage of instruments. The organisms may also reach the bladder from the urethra in gonorrhoea and in cases of retention with overflow, or they may And their way from the kidney when pyelitis or pyelo-nephritis is present, and possibly also sometimes from the blood, as in typhoid fever. We may divide cystitis into three large groups :â€” 1. Those in which some pre-existing condition predisposes the bladder to infection. Here the cystitis is secondary, and its treatment must be considered in connection with that of the primary condition ; examples of this are stricture of the urethra, enlargement of the prostate, and vesical calculus. 2. Those in which the bladder affection is part of a microbic disease, such as gonorrhoea or tuberculosis. These are discussed in connection with those diseases. 3- Those in which the cystitis is primary. Here, however, there are generally some previous conditions which favour the development of the organisms, especially such as interfere with the proper evacuation of the bladder or the nutrition of its walls : a typical example is cystitis in connection with paraplegia. A great variety of organisms are found associated with cystitis, amongst the commonest of which are the bacillus coli and various forms

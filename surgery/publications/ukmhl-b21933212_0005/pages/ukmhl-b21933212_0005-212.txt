AFFECTIONS OF THE BREAST i8o which leave the deeper surface of the breast and join lymphatic plexuses in the pectoral fascia, running thence to the axillary glands. This seems to be one of the commonest paths by which infection spreads in cancer Fig. 45. — Incision for removal of a Fig. 46. — Incision for removal of a Cancerous Tumour occupving the upper Cancerous Tumour occupying the inner quadrant of the Breast. quadrant of the Breast. of the breast. The lymphatics in the pectoral fascia also communicate with those in the greater pectoral muscle and thus the disease may be dis- tributed throughout that structure.

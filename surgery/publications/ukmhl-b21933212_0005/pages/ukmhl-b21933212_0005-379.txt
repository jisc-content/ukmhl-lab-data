347 FOREIGN BODIES over one end of it, after which the body can be easily seized with forceps introduced through the tube, and removed. If this cannot be done, the urethroscopic tube should be withdrawn and a pair of urethral forceps should be passed down with closed blades until they touch the foreign body, which is prevented from slipping backwards by compressing the urethra behind it. When the foreign body is reached, the blades of the forceps are widely opened and attempts are made to insinuate them between the body and the mucous membrane. If this is successful the foreign body is gently withdrawn. No attempt whatever should be made Fig. 92.â€”The Extraction of a pin from the Urethra. /, The pin lying head downwards in the urethra. //, By pressure on the head of the pin, the point, a, is driven through the sldn. ///, This is seized, pulled out right up to tlie head, rotated in the direction of the arrow and then,/K, pushed head first up the urethra and, V, extracted. to push the body along the urethra towards the meatus by squeezing the parts from outside, as this is not likely to succeed and may seriously damage the mucous membrane. If this attempt should prove unsuccessful after a short trial, it should not be persisted in, as the mucous membrane is easily damaged even by the most careful manipulations with forceps. The case should at once be treated as if the body were impacted, and the latter removed by an external incision. (b) When the body is rough, pointed, or impacted, or when the above treatment fails, removal must be effected through an external incision. The foreign body is readily defined and fixed in position by compressing the urethra behind it when it lies in the penile urethra, and all that is then necessary is to stretch the parts firmly over it and incise

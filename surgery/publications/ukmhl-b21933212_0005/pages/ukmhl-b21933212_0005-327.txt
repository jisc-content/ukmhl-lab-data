INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS 295 and the maintenance of the dorsal position. The morphine is best given in half-grain suppositories, to which may be added a quarter of a grain of extract of belladonna. Occasionally, benefit may be obtained by the administration of ten-grain doses of salicylate of soda three or four times daily. The patient should be kept on a light semi-fluid diet. As the inflammation subsides, the scrotum may be enveloped in lint thickly spread with glycerinum belladonn?e, outside which is applied a large mass of cotton-wool kept on by a lace-up bag. Compression must be employed very carefully because it may do harm if it is begim too early, and special care must be taken to see that the bandage is not drawn so tightly above the testis as to interfere with the circulation.

The method of applying the strips of strapping alternately vertically and horizontally is seen in b. In a fortnight or three weeks the pain and tenderness will have dis- appeared, leaving a hard mass in the epididymis, and at this period firm compression is useful in causing absorption of the inflammatory exudation. The old plan of strapping the testicle is very valuable. The scrotum is shaved and cleansed, the affected testis is isolated from its fellow, and a narrow strip of boric lint is wound around the scrotum above it. Over this a strip of strapping is applied circularly and tightly enough to prevent the testis from slipping up through it, and then a series of alternate vertical and horizontal strips is applied, as shown in Fig. 72, until the whole organ is covered in. The strapping is applied as firmly as the patient can bear, and should be worn for two or three days and then renewed. It should be continued until all the thickening has

vii PREFACE TO REVISED EDITION. Since the first edition of this work was published many changes have naturally occurred in the field of Surgical Treatment. Attempts have been made from time to time to incorporate the most essential of these in successive impressions, but it is always difficult to interpolate new matter of this kind satisfactorily without extensive revision of the entire work. It has therefore seemed best to revise the matter throughout and to alter in it whatsoever was necessary to bring it up to date. The original scheme of the work has been adhered to ; to depart from it would have been to abandon the fundamental idea upon which it was based. Every part of the book, however, has been thoroughly revised, and a considerable part has been re-written. The pressure of other work rendered it impossible for the original authors to undertake a task of such magnitude with any hope of being able to complete it within a reasonable time. In Messrs. T. P. Legg and Arthur Edmunds they have been fortunate in securing collaborators who have rendered their task possible, and to them they are under a great obligation. To their colleagues Dr. Silk, Dr. D'Este Emery, Dr. Arthur Whitfield and Mr. A. D. Reid, they are also much indebted for help in the several departments of treatment with which these gentlemen are specially concerned. Mr. Arthur Edmunds, in addition to his share in the revision, has provided a number of the new illustrations; Messrs. F. Butterworth and S. A. Sewell have drawn the remainder. Messrs. Down Bros., Allen & Hanburys, Barth, and others have kindly allowed the reproduction of many instrument blocks from their cata- logues. Other figures have been reproduced by piermission of their authors or publishers, and the source from which they are derived will be found duly acknowledged in the text. London, 1913.

GALL-STONES 43 symptoms of suppurative cholangitis or perforation of the galLbladder or bile-ducts. An operation for gall-stones may vary from a simple procedure to one of exceeding difficulty without there being any indication before- hand as to which it will turn out to be. It is important that the patient should be directly under the eye of the surgeon for the hrst week at least after the operation, as many points may arise in the after-treatment with which he can deal best. The preliminaries for the operation are similar to those for laparotomy (see Vol. IV. p. 208), and every precaution must be taken against shock, as, although the operation is neither prolonged nor severe in ordinary cases, Fig. 5.â€”A method of making the Bile-ducts accessible. This applies to an ordinary operating-table. (Mayo Robson, in A System of Opera/ive Surgery, edited by F. F. Burghard.) a bad case of stone impacted in the common duct may mean a most tedious and difficult operation. The bowels should be thoroughly evacuated before the operation. If chronic jaundice is present, it will be well to give two doses of 30 grains each of lactate of calcium the day before the operation, and to repeat the dose by the rectum after the operation if the coagulating power of the blood is feeble. The position of the patient on the operating-table is important (see Fig. 4). The bile-passages may be rendered accessible by placing a sand- bag about four inches deep beneath the floating ribs on an ordinary table. This throws the liver well up and at the same time allows the intestines to fall away from it downwards towards the pelvis (see Fig. 5). A good light upon the operation area is indispensable.

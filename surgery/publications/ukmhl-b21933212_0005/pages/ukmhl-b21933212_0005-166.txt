CHAPTER XII. THE OPERATIONS UPON THE LARYNX AND TRACHEA. TRACHEOTOMY. The trachea may be opened either above or below the isthmus of the thyroid gland, which lies over the third and fourth rings of the trachea ; the operation is spoken of as ' high ' or ' low,' according to the situation of the opening relative to the isthmus. In practice, however, there is no strict line of demarcation between the two operations, because it is often necessary to divide the thyroid isthmus partially or even completely. The operation in most frequent use is high tracheotomy, because the trachea is more accessible, the operation is less likely to damage important structures and can be more rapidly done, and there is less likelihood of septic cellulitis spreading from the wound into the anterior mediastinum. When, however, the operation is done in order to reach a foreign body lodged in the bronchus, the low operation is to be preferred as it enables the body to be reached more easily. When it is necessary to perform a preliminary tracheotomy for the insertion of a Hahn's canula, as in various mouth operations, it is usually best to divide the thyroid isthmus partially or entirely ; this should generally be done in the case of a preliminary tracheotomy for excision of the larynx. HIGH TRACHEOTOMY. The patient should be placed in a good light with a firm sand-bag beneath the neck so as to project the trachea forwai^d. If a general anaesthetic is employed, it should be administered very slowly so as not to increase the dyspnoea. The surgeon stands on the right of the patient, grasps the thyroid cartilage between the left thumb and middle finger and places the index upon the ponium Adami; in this way the trachea is steadied and the middle line indicated. When the chin, the thyroid

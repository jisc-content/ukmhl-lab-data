CHAPTER LI. CONGENITAL ABNORMALITIES OF THE KIDNEY AND URETER: NEPHROPTOSIS. Althoisgh the ahnormaliiies of the kidney arc not amenable to treatment they may be met with during operations and may puzzle the operator. For example, the two kidneys may be fused together to form a ' Jiorse- shoe kidney,' and this may be situated as low down as the sacro-iliac synchondrosis, the promontory of the sacrum, or even lower. Displace- ments of one kidney or of both may also occur, and the kidney may vary in form or size and may be markedly lobulated. There may be only a single kidney present. Congenital cystic disease of the kidney is usually bilateral and is not then amenable to treatment. Ahnormalities of the ureter are not uncommon. The hilum may be absent, the renal pelvis may be double, the ureter may be double at its upper part—though rarely throughout its whole length—or it may terminate in the urethra, the seminal vesicles, the vagina, or even the rectum. Congenital prolapse of the lower end of the ureter into the bladder is also met with ; it may also be acquired as the result of stenosis of the ureteral orifice. The ureter may be compressed by an abnormal renal artery, or congenital strictures may occur in it ; these conditions may be accompanied by hydronephrosis or atrophy of the kidney, and are referred to on p. 580. NEPHROPTOSIS OR MOVABLE KIDNEY. The normal kidney is somewhat movable on respiration in the vertical direction, but it should not descend to a lower level when the patient assumes the upright position. When it does so, or when the kidney comes so low down that it can be grasped and fixed between the examiner's hands the condition is abnormal. A movable kidney may be either congenital or acquired. In very rare cases there is an exceptionally long renal pedicle, and this and the

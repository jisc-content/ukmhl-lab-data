364 CHAPTER XXXVI. STRICTURE OF THE URETHRA. Under this term are included all obstructions to micturition due to alterations in the wall of the urethra. Three forms may be distinguished, namely : spasmodic stricture, in which the obstruction is due to spasm of the muscles surrounding the membranous urethra; congestive stricture, in which the difficulty is due to inflammatory swelhng of the mucous membrane, generally of gonorrhoeal originâ€”when this condition causes complete retention of urine it is associated with spasm of the membranous urethra; organic stricture, which is the most important form, and will be described first. ORGANIC STRICTURE. In this condition there is an actual organic change in the urethral wall, which leads to narrowing or rigidity of the canal. Organic stricture may be of two varieties, (i) It may be traumatic following bruising or rupture of the urethra ; in this case the stricture is due to contraction of the cicatrix formed during repair of the injury. When the urethra is torn across, an annular stricture forms ; when the tear is only partial, ridges and less complete strictures occur. This form of stricture is most common in the membranous urethra (see Chap. XXXIII.). (2) The great majority of organic strictures are inflammatory in origin, and are due either to repeated attacks of gonorrhoea or to long- continued gleet in which the inflammation does not remain limited to the surface of the mucous membrane but involves the submucous coat and even the spongy tissue. This form of stricture occurs chiefly in the spongy urethra, most commonly at, or close to, the bulb, and may spread back and involve the commencement of the membranous portion, although this is comparatively rare. Organic stricture also frequently occurs near the urethral orifice, while another common situation is in front of the scrotum at the point of flexure of the penis. The stricture

CYSTOSCOPY 497 senting the diameters in millimetres. Each instrument has an obturator, which'is used during introduction. A dilator (see Fig. 132) is used to enlarge the orifice of the urethra, and an evacuator to remove the urine which accumulates in the bladder during a prolonged examination. The evacuator consists of a rubber exhausting-bulb and 14 inches of fine rubber tubing, and, at the bladder end, a small hollow perforated metal ball. The lower bowel is emptied, and immediately before the examina- tion, the bladder is emptied in a sitting or standing position. General Fig. 133.â€”LuYs's Direct Cystoscope. The principle is similar to that of the urethroscope, shown in Fig. 95, except that here there is a suction apparatus to remove the urine. The two lower figures are the tube and obturator for the female; the two upper, those for the male. anaesthesia is necessary in nervous individuals. Local anaesthesia is obtained by cocaine introduced on pledgets of wool. Two positions are used : {a) the elevated dorsal, (b) the knee-chest. (a) The elevated dorsal position is less trying to the patient, but it is only of service in thin patients, and the atmospheric distension of the bladder is not so good. The bladder of stout patients will rarely distend at all in this position. The buttocks are raised lo or 12 inches above the table level, the speculum is introduced, the obturator withdrawn and the atmospheric pressure distends the bladder. V. K K

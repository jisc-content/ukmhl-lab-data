CHAPTER XXV. V. 273 T NEW GROWTHS OF THE PENIS. The only important growths affecting the penis are papillomata and epithehomata. WARTS. These are common in connection with gonorrhoea ; they are probably not due to the gonococcus itself, but are caused by the irritating discharge. They also occur after frequent attacks of balanitis. Gonorrhoeal warts are exceedingly common in the female, in whom they may cover the entire vulva ; in the male they may also be met with about the cicatrices of soft sores. The growths must be distinguished from condylomata, especially in the female ; this is readily done by noticing their pedun- culated character, their characteristic papilhe, and the absence of any tendency to undergo ulceration. TREATMENT.â€”The ordinary method of treatment is to snip off the warts. Single warts may be snipped off with a pair of scissors curved upon the fiat, and the bleeding stopped by a nitrate of silver point. Small isolated gonorrhoeal warts occasionally disappear if they are kept clean and dusted with equal parts of oxide of zinc, calomel, and starch, but removal with scissors is a quicker plan. When the area affected is very extensive and it is desirable to avoid leaving a large raw surface, the warts may occasionally disappear if they are kept dry and painted daily or every second day with salicylic collodion (loo grains of salicylic acid to the ounce of flexile collodion). Good results are also obtained in some cases by exposure to X-rays. EPITHELIOMA. Malignant disease of the penis is not uncommon, and it commences more frequently upon the glans than upon the prepuce. It usually begins in the sulcus behind the corona, but it may occur at the preputial ring.

PHIMOSIS 263 corona, as in the previous operation (see Fig. 65, //). Before doing this it is often possible to secure tlT.e two small arteries which enter the prepuce on the dorsum, and if this can be done before they have retracted into the loose tissue of the penis a good deal of trouble is often obviated. The adhesions are then separated as before, and the redundant mucous membrane of the prepuce is clipped away along the same lines as in the previous operation, after which the bleeding is stopped and the wound sutured. The after-treatment is similar to that of the hrst method. In all cases the greatest care should be taken to obtain complete hcemostasis. Fig. 65.—Another method of performing Circumcision. / illustrates the method of estimating the amount of prepuce to be removed. The forceps are applied to the flaccid organ in the position of the dotted outline, i.e. just in front of the greatest transverse diameter of the glans. On gently closing their blades the glans slips back and the portion of the prepuce to be removed remains in front. // shows how the divided margin of the skin has retracted behind the corona glandis. If this is not done, the penis may be much distended with blood a few hours after the operation, the unsecured vessels having retracted under the skin where they have gone on bleeding. If this happens, the child should be anaesthetised, the clots squeezed out, and the bleeding points secured. In performing this operation it is important to cut the mucous membrane of the prepuce obliquely, as shown in Fig. 64. If too much is removed, a very troublesome triangular surface will be left below the frenum, which takes a considerable time to heal and leaves a sensitive, ugly sweUing for a long time. After-treatment.—^These wounds will heal well without any dressing at all, but a common plan is to wind a strip of wet boric lint or ribbon

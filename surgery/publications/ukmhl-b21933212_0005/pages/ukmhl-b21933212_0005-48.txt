AFFECTIONS OF THE LIVER i6 attempts to clamp or ligature bleeding vessels on the torn surface of the organ are futile. The surgeon must trust to pressure, and the best way of obtaining this is to insert mattress sutures through the thickness of the liver so as to press the bleeding surfaces together over a large area, in much the same way as for similar injuries in the kidney (see Fig. 2). A large perineal needle threaded with stout catgut is thrust through the capsule some distance from the edge of the wound on one side, is then carried Fig. 2â€”SurURE of a laceration of the anterior margin of the Liver. The cUagrams show how the sutures are passed through the entire thickness of the liver in order to get a firm compression. through the whole thickness of the liver, and finally made to emerge at a corresponding point on the opposite side of the wound, where the end of the suture is caught by an assistant. The needle is then withdrawn without unthreading it and passed through the liver a second time in a similar manner an inch or so farther down the line of laceration. When its point emerges at the opposite side, the needle is unthreaded and with- drawn and the suture is tied after the assistant has approximated the torn surfaces. The suture must be tied just tight enough to approximate the cut surfaces without cutting through the friable liver substance ; if the capsule is not included in these sutures they cut through at once.

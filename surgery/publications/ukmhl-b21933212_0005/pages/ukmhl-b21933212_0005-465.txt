433 PATENCY OF THE URACHUS TRBATMEISTT,â€”If a probe shows that the urachus between the fistulous opening and the apex of the bladder is pervious, an attempt may be made to pare the fistulous opening and to bring the edges both of the urachus and the abdominal tissues together so as to give a firm union and close the fistula. Should this fail or should the lower portion of the urachus not be pervious, the fistulous track must be dissected out and the opening into the bladder inverted and closed by Lembert's sutures. In some cases the bladder is projected up in a cone-shaped manner ; in them excision of the apex of the cone, followed by inversion and suture of the edges, is the proper practice.

CHAPTER XXVI. 279 AFFECTIONS OF THE SCROTUM. INJURIES. WOUNDS. These may be incised, punctured, or contused. They rnay be limited to the skin or they may extend deeply enough to expose the testis ; the latter may be wounded or may protrude through the wound. TRB ATMEISTT.â€”The skin of the scrotum is shaved and disinfected, any bruised tags are cut away, the wound is sponged over with i in 20 carbolic lotion and subsequently with i in 2000 sublimate solution, and the edges are brought together with fine interrupted catgut sutures; drainage should always be provided. Should the testis be protruding, it should be disinfected in the same manner and replaced. If the testis has been prolapsed for some hours, an acute hydrocele may have formed, and will require tapping before reduction can be effected ; the parts should be thoroughly disinfected before the tapping is performed. The chief trouble in connection with wounds of the scrotum is the tendency for blood to accumulate in the loose subcutaneous tissue, giving rise to a large hsematoma, which may not disappear for several weeks. For this reason great care must be taken to arrest bleeding completely, and also to provide free escape for blood by means of drainage tubes. CONTUSIONS. When these injuries are severe there is extensive extravasation of blood into the loose tissues outside the tunica vaginalis, and the name scrotal hcematocele is sometimes given to this condition. In rare cases this haematoma may communicate directly with the cavity of the tunica vaginalis, in which there is then also a collection of blood. The usual causes of scrotal haematocele are blows or crushes of the part, or bleeding

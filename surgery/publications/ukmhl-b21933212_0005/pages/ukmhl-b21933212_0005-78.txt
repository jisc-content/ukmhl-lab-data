46 AFFECTIONS OF THE LIVER Cholecystotomy.—After the abdomen has been opened (see p. 44) and the condition of the parts ascertained, abdominal cloths are packed round the gall-bladder, and the fundus is drawn well up into or out of the wound; if the organ is distended, it is well to draw off the bulk of the fluid with a trochar and canula so as to prevent the bile from flooding the wound when the incision is made into the gall-bladder.

The stones are removed with forceps or a scoop (see Fig. 10), and the interior of the gall-bladder is explored with the finger, in order to make sure that all the stones have been re- moved. The opening in the fundus is now covered with a piece of wet gauze, the surgeon cleanses his hands afresh and palpates the duct from

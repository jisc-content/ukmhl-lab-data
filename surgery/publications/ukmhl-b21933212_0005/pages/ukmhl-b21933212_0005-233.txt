201 CHAPTER XVII. INJURIES OF THE THORAX AND ITS CONTENTS. INJURIES OF THE THORACIC WALL. The importance of injuries of the thoracic wall depends largely upon whether the thoracic viscera are also damaged or not. CONTUSIONS OF THE CHEST. These are generally due to severe compression—as in run-over accidents —from the impact of a spent bullet, or from a fall. The injury to the soft parts is comparatively trifling, but there may be considerable bruising or laceration of the muscles. These contusions may be accompanied by fracture of the ribs (see Chap. XVI.), or there may be severe intra- thoracic damage without any fracture. The relative frequency of visceral injury with or without fracture of the ribs depends partly on the age of the patient and partly on the nature and severity of the injury. In young children the ribs will bear much compression without under- going fracture, and in them it is not uncommon to get severe injury to the thoracic viscera alone. The rapidity with which the blow is struck is also of importance, as slow compression of the chest wall gives rise to less damage than a sudden sharp blow, because in the former case the viscera have time to accommodate themselves to the altered shape of the thorax. A peculiar condition, termed ' concussion of the chest ' or ' commotio thoracica,' is sometimes met with, in which there is fatal collapse as the result of an injury, and yet on post mortem examination no definite lesion can be found. This condition is commonly attributed to direct injury to the intra-thoracic portion of the vagus, but paralysis of the sympathetic has also been suggested ; it is also possible that it may be the result of direct compression of the heart.

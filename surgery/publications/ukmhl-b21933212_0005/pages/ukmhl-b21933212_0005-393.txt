We are in the habit of passing a larger dry mop down the tube immediately after the application has been made in order to absorb any excess. The greatest gentleness is necessary in the manipulations, as the slightest injury to the urethral mucous membrane will lead to bleeding, which obscures the view of the parts. Local applications.—The best application for granular patches is a Fig. yo.—I'uwlll's Inflating Urethroscope. The proximal end of the tube is closed by a glass window which enables the urethra to be distended by means of the bellows. The light is reflected from the handle down the tube. solution of nitrate of silver. When the mischief is comparatively extensive and scattered over the urethra, a mild solution should be employed, otherwise the reaction may be severe. A solution of five grains to the ounce will suffice in the first instance, and it will be found that the number of granular patches will steadily become less ; if necessary, stronger solutions (up to 3j or 31] to the ounce) may be applied to the more resistant points. The applications should be made at intervals of about a week, and during the time that the patient is under treatment, the general measures for acute gonorrhoea (see p. 352) should be adopted, both as

CHAPTER X. 124 PERSISTENT THYRO-GLOSSAL TRACT : INJURIES OF THE LARYNX. PERSISTENT THYRO-GLOSSAL TRACT. This embryonic structure commences at the foramen ceecum on the dorsum of the tongue and runs downwards in the middle hne of that organ, passing behind or through the body of the hyoid bone and in front of the thyroid cartilage to the isthmus of the thyroid gland ; the thyroid isthmus is developed from it. As a rule the entire tract is obliterated, but the whole or a portion of it may remain and give rise to a central fistula, the lower opening of which is situated just above the thyroid isthmus. In other cases the tract may be obliterated at both ends and an unobhterated portion in its course may become dilated, leading to the formation of a cyst, either in the neighbourhood of the base of the tongue or just in front of the thyro-hyoid membrane and extending upwards behind the hyoid bone. TREATMENT.—Of a fistula.—A thyro-glossal fistula may cause so little trouble that it may not be necessary to adopt any treatment for it. In some cases, however, the fistula discharges, and is a source of irritation and discomfort. The only treatment likely to do good is to dissect out the fistula completely. It will not close until its epithelial lining has been entirely removed, and any attempt short of excison, such as destruction by caustics or the cautery, invariably fails. The complete removal of the fistula is not easy. An incision is carried downwards from the upper border of the hyoid bone, diverging below so as to enclose the orifice of the fistula. The fistulous tract is defined by passing a probe along it, or by injecting a 5 per cent, solution of methylene blue into it, and its wall is then dissected out. In cases in which the sinus runs up near the foramen caecum, difficulty is met with when the posterior surface of the hyoid bone is reached, because it

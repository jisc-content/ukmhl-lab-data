INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS recesses in the cavity, as fresh abscesses and sinuses will almost certainly form. More than one incision may be required when the abscess has burrowed widely; in these cases a tube should be placed in each incision. Superficial suppuration may also occur in connection with a lobule of the breast; a small abscess forms between the breast and the skin and bursts through the latter if left alone. Abscesses of this type are not infrequently close to or beneath the areola. Incision and drainage will lead to rapid healing. It is not uncommon for a patient to present herself with a number of sinuses in the breast resulting from an abscess which has been imperfectly opened and drained. These sinuses will not heal unless they are opened up and the breast may become so disorganised as to be Fig. 43.â€”Breast-support. The sketch shows how the apparatus can be made to give proper support to a breast of any size by varying the relative lengths of the upper and lower borders. useless. Each sinus should be enlarged and the finger introduced so as to see that there is a free communication between the various sinuses and that every recess is drained. Tubes should be passed through from sinus to sinus or into any recess. Syringing the sinuses is inadvisable ; the drainage tubes can gradually be shortened and withdrawn and the sinuses heal one by one. When, however, the breast is completely riddled with sinuses, amputation of the gland may be the better treatment. SUB-MAMMARY ABSCESS. Acute abscesses may form deep in the breast and spread into the cellular tissue beneath it instead of travelling towards the surface ; these give rise to the acuie suh-mammary abscess. A similar condition may follow injuries, strains of the arm, or a haematoma which has suppurated. In these cases the breast is raised en masse and projects

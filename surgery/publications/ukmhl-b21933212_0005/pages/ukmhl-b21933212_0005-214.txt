If the outer end of the incision is too low, there is a tendency to the formation of a web-Hke scar across the axilla, which limits the move- ments of the arm.

If the skin over the axillary glands is bound down to them, it must be treated like the skin over the primary growth and removed widely. The importance of removing a wide extent of skin cannot be insisted upon too strongly, and the surgeon should never perform this part of the operation unsatisfactorily, from the fear that it may be impossible to bring the skin together afterwards. It will usually be possible to close the wound completely by means of tension stitches and undercutting, or by a plastic operation, but even if not, the wound can be made to heal by skin-grafting. The disadvantages of a slowly healing wound must never be allowed to weigh against the advantages of thorough removal of the disease.

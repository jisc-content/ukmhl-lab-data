171 CHAPTER XV. TUMOURS OF THE BREAST. Mammary tumours may be either simple or malignant ; with the exception of the fibro-adenomata, the former are rare. Fibrous masses may occur, but they are most often the result of previous chronic lobular mastitis which leads to the destruction of the acini, and leaves a thickening which goes on increasing in size. FIBRO-ADENOMA. This is the most common benign tunrour of the breast. Pure adeno- mata—that is to say, tumours composed entirely of acini—are rare ; in the great majority of so-called adenomata, the epithelial tubules are separated by a considerable amount of fibrous tissue, and the epithelial proliferation is probably secondary. In one form of fibro- adenoma the epithelial elements are chiefly arranged as small clusters of acini—the so-called ' acinous adenoma ' ; whilst in the other, ducts ramify through the fibrous tissue and are dilated and rami- fied—the so-called ' tubular or canalicular adenoma.' The fibrous tissue forming the bulk of the tumour may be embryonic, or at any rate highly cellular; in some cases it is myxomatous and the growth is then termed a ' myxo-adenoma.' Occasionally, the acini become dilated and form cysts, from the walls of which masses of young fibrous tissue covered with epithelium project into the cavity, forming ' infra-cystic growths.' Tumours in which intra-cystic growths are present sometimes grow rapidly and may attain a considerable size. Haemorrhage not infrequently occurs into the cyst, and rapid increase in size takes place. Sometimes the connective tissue is of the embryonic type, and in these cases the growth of the tumour may be very rapid ; this variety has been termed ' adeno-sarcoma,' but it would seem probable that the true sarcomatous tumour of the breast is one which contains either no glandular elements whatever or only the remains of tubules. These tumours are frequently encapsuled. They are generally single,

144 AFFECTIONS OF THE NECK Fig. 38). Both give an almost parallel beam of light and therefore the maximum of illumination. Briining's lamp is attached by a handle to 3 A ^ c Fig. 35.—Bruning's Bronchoscope. A is the inner tube which is passed down when the outer tube, B, is in the trachea. C shows one tube within the other ; the inner one can be protruded for a considerable distance by means of the watch-spring attached to its upper end. the outer tube and is so arranged that it can be moved up and down and from side to side, thus allowing the passage of instruments without shutting off the light. Various kinds of forceps are required for the re- moval of a foreign body ; these are introduced through the tube. An illustration of one of these forceps is shown in Fig. 37. As a quantity of mucus may be secreted during the examination, it is advisable to have a suction apparatus at hand in order to extract it, and also a supply of cotton-wool mops. Ancesthesta. — In children, a general anaesthetic is necessary, and cocaine should be used as sparingly as possible.

Chloroform is preferable to ether, as it causes less secretion of mucus. During the whole examination, a careful watch must be kept on the general condition of the patient; stimulants, oxygen, and tracheotomy instruments should be at hand in case they Fig. 36.—Bruning's Hand-lamp.

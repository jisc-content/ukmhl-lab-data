AFFECTIONS OF THE LIVER 34 the blockage becomes complete. On the other hand, the inflammation may pass on to acute suppm'ative hepatitis. Diffuse cholangitis.—^This is more common in connection with specific diseases, such as typhoid fever, appendicitis, pysemia, or dysentery. The inflammation varies much in intensity and may be suppurative or gangrenous and may be followed by most serious complications, such as septicaemia or pysemia. The symptoms are similar to those of the suppurative form, but rigors are generaUy present, the liver is markedly enlarged, and the patient rapidly passes into the typhoid state. TRBATMBISTT.—The treatment of this affection should be mainly directed to the cause, and wiU consist in removing any gall-stones that have given rise to the affection and securing efficient drainage of the bile- passages (see Chap. V.). Any abscess in the liver should be opened and drained as early as possible (seep. 23). Should no gall-stones be found in the common duct and should the gall-bladder be involved, cholecy- stostomy with drainage for a few weeks should be carried out. In all cases the common duct should be opened and a drainage tube inserted into it.

528 CHAPTER LII. INJURIES OF THE KIDNEY AND URETER. INJURIES OF THE KIDNEY. The kidney may be injured with or without an external wound. The latter group of cases is the more difficult to deal with ; the presence of an open wound simplifies the diagnosis very much. INJURIES WITHOUT AN EXTERNAL WOUND. Injuries to the kidney are most often due to crushes or blows on the abdomen or the loin ; they may follow violent lateral flexion of the trunk, and may be caused by or associated with fracture of the eleventh or twelfth ribs. They often form part of other lesions, such as fractures of the spine or the ribs, or rupture of the diaphragm, liver, spleen, or duodenum. A very important point affecting treatment is whether the peritoneum over the kidney has been torn or not, because if it has, blood and urine will escape into the peritoneal cavity and seriously complicate the case. The injury to the kidney may be limited to haemorrhage beneath the capsule, or there may be extensive laceration of the renal substance, tearing of the renal pelvis, injury to the renal vessels, or complete pulping-up of the organ. From the point of view of treatment, the following grouping of the cases may be useful:â€” 1. Injury to the peri-renal capsule alone without damage to the true capsule of the kidney or the renal tissue. 2. Bruises of the kidney, without rupture of the capsule. 3. Rupture of the kidney and its proper capsule, not e.xtending into the pelvis of the organ. 4. Extensive rupture of the kidney substance running into the pelvis. These are the ordinary severe cases met with in practice. 5. Extreme damage, the organ being broken up into fragments or entirely pulped-up.

CHAPTER XXXI. 310 HYDROCELE : HEMATOCELE : VARICOCELE. HYDROCELE. ACUTE HYDROCELE. This form is rare as compared with chronic hydrocele, and generally follows injury, or is secondary to acute epididymitis or orchitis ; some- times it occurs in connection with an inflammatory condition of the scrotum or cord, and it may accompany thrombosis of a varicocele or follow specific fevers. The surface of the tunica vaginalis becomes coated with lymph, which may ultimately cause some obliteration of the vaginal sac from adhesion of the opposed surfaces. The effused fluid coagulates readily, and as a rule is absorbed quickly when the primary cause ceases to act ; the condition may, however, become chronic. The outlines of the testicle and epididymis are lost and a smooth, fluctuating, translucent swelling is formed which is very tender, the skin over it being red and oedematous ; there is no pyrexia. TREIATMENT.â€”As this condition is a secondary one, the impor- tant point is the treatment of the primary trouble ; when this disappears the inflammation soon passes off. The treatment should be that appro- priate for acute epididymitis (see p. 293). Operative interference is seldom required, but, if the pain is great and the swelling does not sub- side, it may be advisable to puncture the sac and draw off the fluid. There is, however, danger of introducing septic material into the sac, and, moreover, coagulation occurs if blood corpuscles become mixed with the hydrocele fluid, and the sac may become filled with clot, which will delay recovery and give rise to partial or complete obliteration of the cavity of the tunica vaginalis. In these cases a small exploring- needle should be used, and any visible vessels should be avoided- The patient should not be allowed to walk about until the fluid

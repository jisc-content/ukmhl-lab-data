We shall describe the various methods of dilating the strictures first, as this is the plan most commonly employed ; even when urethrotomy is to be performed, some dilatation of the stricture must as a rule precede the operation. In examining a case for stricture by means of a bougie it is not unusual to mistake spasm of the urethra for an organic stricture, and this is

INTERMITTENT HYDRONEPHROSIS 587 lumbar incision, an incision made in its pelvis around the attacliment of the ureter, and an oval piece containing the ureteral orifice detached ; at the lower part, the incision runs about a quarter of an inch beyond the point where the ureter leaves the pelvis, at the sides the distance about half an inch, and at the upper part it is rather more. When this piece is detached, the orifice of the ureter is enlarged if necessary in the manner described above (see Fig. 1^2, A). A piece of the dilated pelvis at the lower end, corresponding in size and shape to the detached portion, is now cut awa}^ and this flap is attached to the opening thus formed (Fig. 152, B) by a double series of Lembert's sutures. If deemed advisable, a portion of the dilated pelvis at the upper part may now be cut away and the opening closed by Lembert's sutures ; in doing this, it is well to avoid making any connection between this incision and that for the attachment of the ureter, otherwise leakage may occur at the line of junction. The final result is shown in Fig. 152, C. The kidney is finally fixed high up in the loin in the usual manner, and the wound is sewn up by through-and-througli stitchesâ€”a drainage tube being left in for a few days.

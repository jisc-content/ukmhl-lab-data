CHAPTER V. 35 D 3 GALL-STONES: BILL^RY FISTULA. GALL-STONES. Calculi in the gall-bladder or the bile-ducts are rare in young sul^jects, but quite common after middle age ; they are more frequently met with in women than in men, and it is said that they occur in one out of every six persons over sixty years of age. In a large number of cases the presence of stones gives rise to no symptoms, and the affection is only discovered post mortem. The size and number of the stones vary widely ; single stones are usually large and round or oval, whilst multiple ones are smaller and have facets on their surfaces where they xwh against one another. These stones consist either of pure cliolesterin, or of this substance combined with a varying amount of bile-salts and bile-pigmentâ€”prin- cipally bilirubin ; lime-salts are also frequently present, and the stone may vary in consistence from an extremely friable mass to one that it is impossible to break up by pressure between the fingers. Anything which hinders the free flow of bile from the gall-bladder may predispose to the formation of gall-stones. A sedentary life and irregular meals may be of importance, as the gall-bladder is then not emptied frequently and regularly ; tight lacing, perhaps, has a similar effect. Heredity seems to have some distinct influence. The essential factor is the retardation of the flow of the bile, and when this occurs, organisms, such as the colon bacillus, may find their way into the gall-bladder and set up a cholecystitis of varying intensity. This gives rise to the deposit of cholesterin, which, with precipitated bile-pigment, forms the gall-stone. The actual nucleus is often a mass of inspissated mucus, epithelium, or bile-salts. Organisms, dead and alive, have been found in a large proportion of stones that have been examined from this point of view, among them not infrequently being the typhoid bacillus. Unlike pancreatic calculi, gall-stones are pervious to the X-rays. They are

496 AFFECTIONS OF THE KIDNEY AND URETER By catheterisation of the ureters, the functional value and presence or absence of disease of each kidnej^ is ascertained, and this is especially important in regard to the supposed healthy kidney when nephrectomy is proposed. Further, the position of an obstruction in the ureter in hydronephrosis can be ascertained by passing a ureteric catheter, and the relation of a doubtful radiographic shadow to the ureter is demon- strated by the passage of a bougie, opaque to the X-rays. Finalty, the introduction of opaque fluids into the pelvis of the kidnej', followed by radiography (pyelography), has proved of immense value in the early diagnosis of dilatation of the kidney, while lavage of the pelvis of the kidney in chronic pyelitis has become, in expert hands, a recognised method of treatment. There are two methods of cystoscopy—the direct and the indirect. This method was perfected by Kelly, and has been used and modified by I-U3's, Braasch, and others. Kelly's specula (see Fig. 131) are metal cylinders, 3J- inches long and of a uniform diameter throughout. There is a funnel-shaped expansion at the outer end, and a handle 3 inches long is attached to the funnel. The specula are made in various sizes from 5 to 20, each number repre- METHODS OF CYSTOSCOPY. Fig. 131.—Kelly's Female Bladder Speculum. Fig. 132.—Kelly's Female Urethra Dilator.

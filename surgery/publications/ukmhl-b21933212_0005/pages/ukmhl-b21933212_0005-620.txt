CHAPTER LVII. 588 NEW GROWTHS OF THE KIDNEY AND ITS PELVIS: HY- PERNEPHROMA: CYSTS: PERI- AND PARA-NEPHRIC TUMOURS. NEW GROWTHS OF THE KIDNEY. Benign tumours, such as myxomata or dermoids, are very rare, and are hardly ever diagnosed until the kidney has been exposed. The great majority of the new growths of the kidney are malignant, sarcoma being more frequent than carcinoma. Carcinoma usually occurs in elderly people, and is accompanied by more profuse haematuria, pain, and cachexia then sarcoma. The sympioms are often very obscure, the chief being hrEmorrhage, pain, and the presence of a tumour. Haematuria may be one of the eariiest symptoms of malignant disease of the kidney, and is often the first that attracts the patient's attention. It occurs spontaneously, is not affected by exertion, is commonly profuse, and may last for some days, ceases and reappears after a short time, and its occurrence is often ushered in by pain. The blood is intimately mixed with the urine, but is apt to clot, and the clots may give rise to renal colic. There may, however, be no haematuria if the growth does not encroach upon the renal pelvis. In many cases, especially in children, the first thing that is discovered is a tumour, especially when the growth is situated in the lower part of the kidney or when the latter is movable. As a rule, it is painless at first, but, as it enlarges, dull, aching pain may set in, referred to the spine or to some of the spinal nerves and closely resembling that due to spinal caries. It has been suggested that the development of a varicocele may be a diagnostic point. The urine is not altered in the early stages ; later on, the urea may be markedly diminished in amount, and pieces of malignant tissue may be found in the urine along with blood and clot. Cachexia and wasting soon become manifest. The growth spreads along the pedicle of the kidney, so that the mass may become adherent to

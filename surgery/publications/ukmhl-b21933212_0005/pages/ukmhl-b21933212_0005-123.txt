91 CHAPTER VIII. THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE CERVICAL GLANDS. These are among the most common and the most important affections of the neck and a variety of conditions may be met witli. Among these may be mentioned acute adenitis, tuberculosis, syphilis, secondary carcinomatous or sarcomatous disease, and primary lymphadenoma or lymphosarcoma. ACUTE ADENITIS. Acute adenitis often follows inflammation or ulceration of the mucous or cutaneous surfaces drained by the glands and may pass off when the infection is at an end. Enlargement of the cervical glands in association with tonsillitis or other inflammations about the throat and mouth, and also after boils or pediculi, is extremely common ; but the adenitis rapidly subsides when the primary source is cured unless pyogenic organisms have reached the gland in considerable numbers or unless the condition is tuberculous. If suppuration occurs, the symptoms vary according to the situation of the gland or glands affected, and may be very acute. As a rule one or two glands only are implicated and the pus forms first in the interior of the gland, but suppurative peri-adenitis soon occurs, and is indicated by induration, redness, and cedema of the skin and tissues around. TREATMENT.â€”In the ordinary acute non-suppiivativc adenitis attention must be directed to the primary trouble, but little need be done as regards the glands beyond relieving the pain, applying hot fomentations frequently, and keeping the head and neck at rest. When the acute stage has passed off, the application of glycerinum belladonnje to the surface is sometimes useful. When suppuration occurs, the abscess must be opened. It is not sufficient, however, to make an opening into a suppurating gland and introduce a tube. The pus in the early stage is often deeply seated in

521 NEPHROPTOSIS OR MOVABLE KIDNEY surgeons using silk, whilst others employ catgut or kangaroo-tendon, especially for the cases in which decapsulation has been practised. The methods of fastening the kidney are numerous, and we shall only indicate the chief points in the two methods of suturing with or without decapsulation. If siifiiriiig without decapsiildtioii is employed, the stitches should Fig. 138.â€”Nephropexy without Decapsulation. The illustration shows the method of passing the sutures through the wall of the loin after they have been inserted through the renal capsule and the kidney has been returned into place. Two sutures are used here, the ends of the upper one being made to emerge from the wall of the loin as close as possible beneath the twelfth rib. The figure shows how to pass the sutures so as to allow the cut edges of the muscles to be appro.'iimated without undue tension on the renal stitches. be passed through the posterior surface of the kidney and not merely through the convex border ; a considerable breadth of the posterior surface should be taken up, the suture emerging near the convex border. One or two stitches may be used for the upper pole of the organ ; the capsule is perforated near the inner border, but not too close to the hilum, and the thread is made to underrun the fibrous capsule, emerging again just internal to the convex border. Sutures are also passed in a similar manner at the lower end of the kidney. When all the stitches are in place, the kidney is returned into its bed and the sutures are then passed

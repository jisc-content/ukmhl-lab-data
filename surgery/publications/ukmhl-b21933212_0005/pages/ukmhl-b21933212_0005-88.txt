AFFECTIONS OF THE LIVER 56 as shown in Fig. 14. After the incision has been made, the stone is re- moved with forceps or a scoop. A probe is then passed up along the duct to see if other stones are present, and if so they are pushed downwards and extracted through the same opening. The anterior wall of the duodenum is closed as after enterotomy, the packing removed, and the abdominal wall sewn up, a drainage tube being inserted for two or three ^ days. After-ireatment.—The after-treatment is in the main that for any severe laparotomy. After the drainage tube has been removed (about Fig. 15.—^The Sling-pillow for maintaining the 'Fowler Position' after OPERATIONS UPON THE BiLE-PASsAGES. By altering the length oi the straps the patient can be made to sit more upright. (Mayo Robson, in A System of Operative Surgery, edited by F. F. Burghard.) the eighth or tenth day) the biliary fistula will gradually close if there is no obstruction to the ducts. It may break open once or twice, possibly from some slight recrudescence of cholangitis, but healing usually remains quite sound after three months. In the general treatment special care must be taken to guard against broncho-pneumonia or pleurisy, which are fairly frequent affections, and are probably due to the immobility of the diaphragm and the bases of the lungs. The best preventive is to place the patient in the ' Fowler position ' (see Fig. 15) from an early period aftei the operation.

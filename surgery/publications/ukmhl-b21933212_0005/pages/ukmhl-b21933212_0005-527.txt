CHAPTER L. 495 CYSTOSCOPY, CYSTOSCOPIC EXAMINATION OF THE URETERS, PYELOGRAPHY, AND EXAMINATION OF THE RENAL FUNCTION. By J. W. Thomson Walker, M.B., F.R.C.S. Surgeon to the North-West London and Hampstead General Hospitals ; Assistant- Surgeon to St. Peter's Hospital for Stone. Since the introducticin of the electric cystoscope by Nitze in 1880, the instrument has been gradually perfected, and at the present time cystoscopy has become the essential method of diagnosis in the majority of urinary diseases. There are few diseases of the bladder m which useful information cannot be gained by cystoscopy: there are many in which a correct diagnosis cannot be made without its use. The sound, digital exploration of the bladder, and exploratory cystotomy have been superseded by the. cystoscope. One great advantage of cystoscopy is that the walls of the bladder are stretched by the distending medium during the inspection, and every part of the viscus can be viewed ; while in other methods, such as cystotomy, the wall is collapsed and may be contracted, and the mucous membrane is thrown into folds, which may conceal some pathological condition. In diseases of the kidney, cystoscopy gives information that may not be obtainable by other methods. Localisation of disease to the kidney by inspection of the ureteric orifices, in cases in which no symptoms are present to point to one kidney or even to the kidney at all, is an important instance. Such cases as unilateral renal hgematuria without other symptoms, or unilateral renal tuberculosis with only symptoms of bladder irritation, may be quoted as typical examples of the value of the cystoscope in localising disease to the kidney. A diagnosis of the nature of the disease of the kidney may also be made by inspection of the ureteric orifice in cases in which the diagnosis is otherwise obscure.

231 SEPTIC MEDIASTINITIS sternum and point between the costal cartilages ; in cases of chronic abscess in the posterior mediastinum, it passes backwards between the ribs forming a dorsal abscess, upwards into the posterior triangle of the neck, or downwards behind the diaphragm. In other cases the abscess may open into the bronchi and the pus may be expectorated, or it may perforate the pleura and set up a pyo-thorax ; sometimes it invades the pericardium and gives rise to suppurative pericarditis. The prognosis is very serious, and the chances of recovery are very slight in acute mediastinal suppuration, the patient dying of pysemia or perforation of the pericardium or pleura, if he does not die of acute septicaemia or of the pressure effects. In chronic cases, however, the abscess frequently finds its way externally, and, if it is opened, the sjanptoms will be relieved. THE ATMENT.â€”This is a matter of extreme difficulty. If a collec- tion of pus in the anterior mediastinum can be accurately diagnosed, it may be possible to get at it by trephining the sternum and enlarging the opening so as to tap the abscess and provide for drainage ; this has been done successfully in a few cases. Should an abscess occur in the posterior mediastinum in connection with perforation of the oesophagus by a foreign body, the abscess may be reached from behind by the operation described in Vol. IV. p. i6g. The treatment of a tuberculous abscess is conducted on lines similar to those for tuberculous abscesses elsewhere.

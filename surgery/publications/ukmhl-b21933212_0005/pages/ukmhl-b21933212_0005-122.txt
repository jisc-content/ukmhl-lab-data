AFFECTIONS OF THE NECK 90 MALIGNANT TUMOURS Primary carcinomata of the neck occurring without any evident lesion of the mucous or cutaneous surface usually develop in connection with a branchiogenic cyst or cleft. They are deeply placed and very adherent to adjacent structures. They grow rapidly and sometimes simulate an abscess, the skin becoming red and oedematous over them. The fluid is of a dirty grey colour and often contains large, soft, white masses composed of squamous epithelial cells. In most cases the tumour cannot be extirpated, and partial excision leaves a foul fungating mass in the neck. The greatest care should be taken in the diagnosis, because a fungating ulcer will rapidly form if the tumour is mistaken for an abscess and incised. Endotheliomata sometimes occur primarily in the neck; the most frequent seat of origin is the carotid body. The tumour forms a soft oval-shaped mass situated beneath the sterno-mastoid muscle and about the level of bifurcation of the carotid artery. It can be moved laterally, but not in a vertical direction, owing to its intimate connection with the carotid sheath ; it may be very vascular. Removal is difficult owing to its close connection with the large vessels.

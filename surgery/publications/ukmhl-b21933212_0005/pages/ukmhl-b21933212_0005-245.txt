213 CHAPTER XVIir. INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS OF THE THORAX AND ITS CONTENTS. ACUTE OSTEO-MYELITIS OF THE THORACIC WALL. Acute infective osteo-myelitis in its typical severe form seldom affects either tlie ribs or sternum, but a less severe or sub-acute form is not uncommon as a sequela of typhoid fever and also in children in connection with acute osteo-myelitis affecting other bones. The symptoms are similar to those of the disease elsewhere (see Vol. II. p. 432), but are generally less acute in character; necrosis of the portions of the ribs or sternum affected commonly follows. The temperature is high and there may be rigors and septicaemic symptoms accompanied by the formation of a tender swelling over the affected area, the skin over which becomes oedematous and boggy and soon shows fluctuation. The sequestrum usually becomes loose in about six weeks and only involves a portion of the bone. TREATMEINT.â€”This is the same as for septic osteo-myelitis in general (see Vol. II. p. 433). The parts should be thoroughly exposed at the earliest opportunity, the pus evacuated, and the wound left open. It is best not to remove any portion of the rib in the first instance, l)ut to wait for the separation of the sequestrum, which is then taken away in the usual luanner (see Vol. II. p. 444). In cases following typhoid fever, however, the typhoid bacillus may remain in the medulla of the bone for a long period and, even if the sequestrum is taken away, healing may not occur and fresh inflammation may be set up. Hence, in these particular cases, we are inclined to depart from the general rule and remove the whole portion of the rib which is the seat of inflammation, so as to make sure of getting rid of the focus of disease.

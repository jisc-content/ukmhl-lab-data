CHAPTER XXII. 253 OPERATIONS FOR PERICARDITIS: CARDIOLYSIS: OPERA- TION FOR PULMONARY EMBOLISM: REMOVAL OF THE THYMUS GLAND. OPERATIONS FOR PERICARDITIS. Pericarditis may be simple or suppurative, acute or chronic; the acute cases belong to the department of the physician, except in so far as the removal of fluid is concerned. In simple serous pericarditis, the embarrassment of the heart's action from the pressure of the effusion may be so great that paracentesis pericardii may be required, but the surgeon is most often called in for cases of purulent pericarditis, for which incision and drainage are necessary. Paracentesis of the pericardium.—This is performed by inserting an aspirating- or large exploring-needle through the fifth intercostal space, an inch to the left of the margin of the sternum. This point is chosen so as to avoid the internal mammary artery, and it will also avoid the pleura if the pericardium is distended. The greatest care must be taken with the aseptic precautions, and it is well to divide the skin with a tenotomy knife as a preliminary measure, so that the needle may be inserted without using any force ; the needle should be passed in slowly and steadily, because a sudden thrust might injure the heart. If the aspirating-bottle is used to withdraw the fluid, it should be attached to the needle during its progress through the tissues, so as to show at once when the fluid begins to escape. The small puncture is closed by a collodion dressing. Drainage of the pericardium.—This is usually effected through an incision in the fourth or fifth intercostal space, but better room is obtained if a portion of the fifth costal cartilage is excised. An incision should be made over the whole length of the fifth costal cartilage; and special care must be taken not to wound the internal mammary artery in separating the cartilage from the surrounding structures.

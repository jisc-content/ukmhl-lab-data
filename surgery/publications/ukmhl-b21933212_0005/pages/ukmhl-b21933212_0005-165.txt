FOREIGN BODIES IN THE LARYNX AND TRACHEA 133 the tracheotomy opening. In some cases removal may be facihtated by extending the incision in the trachea downwards as low as possible ; it is always well to do this before abandoning the operation. If this method is unsuccessful, the patient should be sent to some institution where the bronchoscope is available. In some cases of long standing, empyema has resulted, the pus in the pleural cavity communicating with the foreign body in the bronchus ; should this be the case, attempts may he made to reach the foreign body from the outside of the chest after resection of one or more hhs. We have had a very satisfactory case of this kind in which a boot-button was extracted from the left bronchus through the chest wall. The great drawback, however, is the difficulty in getting the sinus in the chest wall to heal subsequently; as the aperture in the skin communicates directly with one of the larger bronchial tubes ; all attempts may fail even after a most extensive resection of ribs. These cases are dealt with more fully in connection with the surgery of the chest (see Chap. XX.).

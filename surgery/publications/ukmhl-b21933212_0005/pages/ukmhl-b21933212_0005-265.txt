DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE OPERATIONS 233 chamber for entrance and exit without altering the pressure. The patient'sheadand neck pass through an opening at one end of the chamber, and are shut off by an elastic india-rubber collar round the neck. The general arrangement is evident from Fig. 57, which shows a convenient portable chamber. One difficulty in Sauerbruch's chamber is that of communicating with the anaesthetist, which in the early model was done by means of a telephone. Lately, a piece of balloon-silk has been inserted near the head end of the chamber, through which the operator's voice can be distinctly heard. Willy Meyer of New York has converted the operating-theatre itself into a negative pressure chamber, the patient's Fig. 57.â€”Sauerbruch's Negative Pressure Chamber. This is the recent model, and is portable. It is fitted with india-rubber flanges below, so that it adheres to the floor when the air inside is being exhausted. The patient's head projects through the opening shown, and rests on the head-rest. Lighting and ventilation are provided for. The convex ends are to allow the surgeon and his assistants suflicicnt elbow-room. (Garr6 and Quincke, The Surgery of the Lung.) head being passed through an opening in the wall into a second chamber of smaller size, which may if necessary be converted into a positive pressure chamber, so that either plan can be adopted according to the requirements of the operator (see Fig. 58). The reduction in pressure should in no case exceed 10 mm. to 12 mm. of mercury; when the chest is first opened, the difference ought not to be so great. Usually, about 3 mm. to 5 mm. of mercury is sufficient until the patient becomes accustomed to it; the pressure may then be reduced to 7 mm. to 9 mm. which is the normal pressure employed. The negative pressure embarrasses the right side of the heart to a certain extent, and therefore if the heart is weak or if there is emphysema, the pressure

257 REMOVAL OF THE THYMUS GLAND according as may seem to be necessary ; it is generally easier to remove the left lobe first, as it lies at a higher level than the right. A curved transverse incision is made low down in the neck After division of the platysma and deep fascia, the inner edges of the sterno- mastoid muscles are detached and the infra-hyoid muscles divided- During respiration, the enlarged thymus will be extruded ; it is recog- nised by its pinkish or grey colour. The gland is seized with forceps and held gently forward, whilst the finger enucleates it from the loose fascia surrounding it. The vessels are secured by forceps and tied with catgut. The cavity left is not drained, the muscles are sutured, and the skin incision closed. Both the immediate and remote results would appear to be excellent. There is very little shock after the operation. The children, who are generally poorly nourished prior to the operation, begin to improve in health, and the dyspnoea and suffocative attacks disappear (see Mayo, Annals of Surgery, July 1912, and Olivier, Arch. gen. de chirurgie, February 25, 1912, and Journal de Chirurgie, March 1912).

AFFECTIONS OF THE URETHRA 36o It is of the utmost importance to observe the most rigid asepsis with all the instruments ; they should be boiled after use, and those parts which cannot be boiled—such as electric lamps—should be disinfected with formalin vapour, otherwise inoculation from one patient to another is very apt to occur. The patient is instructed to say if the point of the instrument passes over any particularly tender spot in its progress, as this is often an indication of the whereabouts of the affected area. The tube is passed in to its full length or as far as it will go. When the tube is in position, the obturator is withdrawn, and the electric light is introduced and switched on. A cotton-wool mop is passed down the tube and made to cleanse the area of mucous membrane Fig. 95.—LuYs's Urethroscope. A powerful illumination is secured by mounting the electric lamp upon a long stem so that it lights the lower end of the tube direct. The tubes are made of different lengths for the anterior and posterior urethra. The obturators are solid. exposed at the bottom of the tube. Special cheap wooden wool-holders that are burned after use are generally employed, but if these are not available, a simple plan is to roughen the end of a fine catheter stylet and roll the wool on that. The stylet is then bent at an angle of 120° about four inches from its handle, and forms a very useful urethroscope mop. Any area found to be affected receives its appropriate treatment {vide infra) as it is exposed. An important point in the technique is always to carry out the examination of the urethra from behind forwai'ds and not from before backwards, because, after the obturator has been taken out, the edge of the tube if pushed onwards, might excoriate the mucous membrane ; hence the tube should be pushed backwards as far as desired before the obturator is withdrawn. Another important point is to make the application with

485 SECTION IV.—AFFECTIONS OF THE KIDNEY AND URETER. CHAPTER XLVIII. ANATOMY OF THE KIDNEY AND URETER. ANATOMY OF THE KIDNEY. Surface anatomy.—x\ccording to Morris (' Surgical Diseases of the Kidney and Ureter'), a horizontal line through the umbilicus passes below the lower hmit of each kidney (see Fig. 128) ; a vertical line carried upwards to the costal margin from the middle of Poupart's ligament has one-third of the kidney to its outer side, and two-thirds to its inner side. On the posierior surface of the body the boundaries of the kidney are as follows:— 1. A line parallel to and one inch from the spinous processes extending from the lower edge of the tip of the eleventh dorsal spine to the level of the lower edge of that of the third lumbar (see Fig. 129). 2. A line carried from the top of this hne outwards at right angles to it for 2| inches. 3. A line carried outwards from the lower end of the vertical line for 2| inches. 4. A line parallel to the first and connecting the outer extremities of the second and third. The upper two-thirds of the normal kidney are under cover of the ribs, but the lower third descends below them. The right kidney is generally lower than the left by something like half an inch. In the hilum of the kidney lie the renal artery, the renal vein, the ureter, lymphatic vessels running to the median lumbar glands, and nerves derived from the renal plexus and the lesser splanchnic nerve. In the pelvis of the kidney the relation of the main structures is, from above downwards, artery, vein, and ureter, and from before backwards,

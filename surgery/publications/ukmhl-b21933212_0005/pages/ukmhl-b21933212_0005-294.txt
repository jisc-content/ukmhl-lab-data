In very young children the penis is often very smaU and retracts into the scrotal tissues : when this is the case, the organ can be rendered more apparent by pressing the tissue back around its root by means of the ring of a pair of Spencer Wells's forceps. Another method of performing circumcision which is very commonly employed is to take a pair of dressing-forceps and place them upon the organ just in front of and parallel to the corona glandis when the penis is lying in its normal condition. The blades of the forceps are then very A B Fig. 64.â€”Circumcision. This is the method recommended in the text.

The portion projecting beyond the forceps is clipped off with a pair of scissors and the forceps are removed. The latter must not grip the prepuce too tightly otherwise bruising may occur, which will interfere with healing.

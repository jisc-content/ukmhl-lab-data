AFFECTIONS OF THE THORAX 236 When a small chamber is used for positive pressure, difficulties arise because the anaesthetist can only handle his apparatus by inserting his arms in rubber gauntlets which are attached to the side of the chamber and which grasp his arm and hands very closely when the pressure is increased. Further, the india-rubber connection around the patient's neck at the lower part of the chamber, which must necessarily be air-tight, tends to bulge downwards when the pressure in the cabinet is increased, and may seriously interfere with the operator Fig. 60.â€”Tiegel's Portable Positive Pressure Apparatus. The details of the face-piece are seen in tlic following figure. The water-valve is seen to the left of the two oxygen cylinders. {Garre and Quincke.) or, at any rate, with the asepsis of the wound. The latter difficulty, however, does not seem insuperable. In this method also air is apt to pass down the oesophagus and lead to great dilatation of the stomach which may embarrass the heart, and has in one case at least led to a fatal result. Attempts have been made to get rid of the chamber and to use a smaller portable arrangement, of which one form (Tiegel's) is shown in Fig. 60. This consists of a face-piece, which is attached to the face by a band round the head, the part next the skin being inflated so as to prevent any escape of air; connected with this mask is a rubber

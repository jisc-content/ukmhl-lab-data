CHAPTER IV. 31 THE INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS OF THE GALL-BLADDER AND BILE-DUCTS. These may be divided into the inflammatory affections of the gall- bladder (cholecystitis), and those of the bile-ducts (cholangitis). CHOLECYSTITIS. This affection is generally acute, and may be simple or suppurative. SUPPURATIVE CHOLECYSTITIS. Suppurative cholecystitis is usually associated witli the presence of stones in the gall-bladder. In thiscondition —sometimes called empyema of the gall-bladder when the latter is much dilated—pus forms in the gall-bladder, which may become distended with a mixture of pus, mucus, and bile. In severe cases there may be a gangrenous inflammation or perforation of the wall ; the gangrenous form, which is not so common as simple empyema, may accompany typhoid fever, dysentery, or appendicitis. Empyema of the gall-bladder is generally associated with the impaction of a stone in the neck of the organ or in the cystic duct, the gall- bladder becoming dilated beyond it. There may be little or no constitutional disturbance, unless ulceration of the mucous membrane is present, but the patient usually suffers from anorexia and malaise, with pain referred to the right hepatic region, and some tenderness on palpation over it. When the gall-bladder is distended, it can be felt as a rounded swelling just outside the ninth costal cartilage on the right side. When, however, there is no distension, the true state of matters is often not recognised until the abdomen has been opened. When the inflammation has lasted for some days, adhesions occur around the gall-bladder which may become fixed to the abdominal wall,

EXTROVERSION 431 transplant the ureters into the pelvic colon, as that part of the intestine will hold a considerable quantity of urine, and the patient may go three hours or more before emptying the bowel; when the implantation is made into the vagina there is constant dribbling of urine. The great objection to transplantation into the bowel is the risk of septic mfection spreading along the ureter, but experience shows that this is much diminished when the ureteral orifices are transplanted bodily into the bowel; the valvular orifices appear to prevent the passage of infective material upwards.

The peritoneum is pushed back as a flap to shut off the general peritoneal cavity from the region of the anastomosis. A drainage tube is inserted at the side of the anastomosis which goes to the bottom of Douglas' pouch. Two or more sutures are passed, uniting the ligamentous symphysis to the fibrous tissue at the upper margin of the opening. The wound is paclicd. The sutures are tightened some days later when the wound is granulating. The wall of the bladder is carefully cleansed and then detached from the peritoneum from above downwards (see Fig. 115). Sometimes there is very little tissue between the two, and care must be taken not to open the peritoneum before the bladder is detached. In other cases there is quite a thick layer of tissue, and the wall of the bladder is dissected up easily. When this detachment has been carried down close to the ureters—which are rendered prominent by inserting bougies into them—the peritoneum is opened, the ureters are traced down to their entrance into the bladder, and the vesical mucous membrane is clipped away entirely, except in the immediate neighbourhood of the ureteral

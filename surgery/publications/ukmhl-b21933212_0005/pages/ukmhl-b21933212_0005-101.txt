69 DIVISION II. THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE NECK. CHAPTER VII. DEFORMITIES, INJURIES, INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS AND TUMOURS OF THE NECK. CONGENITAL MALFORMATIONS. The following are the chief congenital malformations which occur in the neck : Fistulae and cysts, in connection with (<?) the branchial clefts ; (h) imperfect closure of the neck ; and {c) the thyroglossal duct (see p. 124) ; pharyngeal and oesophageal hstulse and pouches (see Vol. IV. p. 119) ; dermoid cysts (see p. 89) ; lymphangiomata (cystic hygroma) (see p. 89) ; and cervical ribs. Congenital wryneck, so called, is probably a condition developed after birth, and therefore we consider it along with wryneck in general. BRANCHIAL FISTUL.E AND BRANCHIOGENIC CYSTS. These are the remains of the branchial clefts, and the position of the fistula depends upon the particular cleft from which it arises ; in almost all cases these fistulae arise in connection with the second cleft. The opening of the fistula is generally situated at the anterior margin of the sterno-mastoid muscle, just above the sterno-clavicular articulation, and it is not uncommon to find a small portion of cartilage at the orifice of the sinus. The canal is usually narrow, but well defined, and may be long and tortuous, frequently passing between the internal and external carotid arteries. At the upper part it runs along the internal carotid artery, passing under the styloglossus and stylopharyngeus muscles, and over

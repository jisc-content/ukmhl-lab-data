CARCINOMA 183 It has been shown by Stiles that the prominence of the breasts does not correspond accurately to the limits of the gland, which may extend in the form of outlying lobules as far upwards as the clavicle, as far inwards as the sternum, as far outwards as the axilla, and as far downwards as almost to reach the costal margin. In a radical operation it is important to excise the subcutaneous tissue in such a way as to remove all these outlying lobules. After making the incision, therefore, Fig. 51.â€”Amputation of the Breast for Carcinoma. Marking oul the skin incisions. The skin remaining is freely undercut so as to remove as much of the subcutaneous fat as possible. the skin is hrst raised with only enough of the superficial fascia to ensure its nutrition, and the incision is gradually deepened by undercutting the skin until it reaches the sternum on the inner side, the clavicle above, the fibres of the latissimus dorsi on the outer side, and the upper part of the rectus abdominis below. When the edge of the latissimus dorsi has been exposed, it is well to detach the flap backwards from the posterior surface of that muscle for three or four inches so that it can be pulled forward when the wound is closed (see Fig. 52).

AFFECTIONS OF THE KIDNEY AND URETER The. operative treatment will vary according to the pathological con- ditions found when the kidney and ureter are exposed. The disease may, for example, be due to a partial stricture of the ureter at the upper part, in which case a plastic operation on the ureter will be necessary {vide infra). The most common condition is, however, intermittent kinking of the ureter in connection with a movable kidney, leading to alteration in the relation of the opening of the ureter to the renal pelvic cavity [vide supra). In the early stage, fixation of the kidney high up in the loin may prevent recurrence of the trouble, but if it has existed for some time, the renal pelvis will have become dilated, and this A B C Fig. 152.â€”Plastic Operation for Intermittent Hydronephrosis. /I, shows the incision for detachment of the ureter ; B, its re-attachment to the renal pelvis lower down, the dotted ellipse being the incision for the removal of the redundant portion of the pelvis; and C the operation completed. operation alone will not succeed, and must be combined with one or other of the following procedures.^ In the earlier cases, after finding that nephropexy was useless, except in a small number of cases, owing to the valvular condition of the ureteral opening in advanced cases, attention was turned to the upper end of the ureter and its relation to the pelvis of the kidney, and attempts were made to do away with the valvular character of the opening. This was done in the manner described on p. 585 ; in several cases much improvement followed, but the result was by no means perfect. The following operation was ultimately evolved, and has answered admirably. The kidney is brought out on the loin through the usual 1 See Intermittent Hydronephrosis, by W.

INJURIES OF THE URETER 543 is due to the absence of the valvular orifice, so that, when the patient micturates, urine is forced up through the ureteral orifice, causing back- ward pressure on the kidney; probably, the more obliquely the ureter is united to the bladder, as in Witzel's method, the less is the chance of regurgitation. A catheter should always be kept in the bladder for some days after the operation, in order to prevent any distension or backward pressure. Uretero-intestinal anastomosis.â€”When the fistulous opening is in such a position that the ureter cannot be made to reach the bladder, the procedure that suggests itself is to graft the ureter into the intestine ; and this has been done with success not only for a fistula of the ureter, but also in cases of malignant disease in the pelvis blocking the ureters and in extroversion of the bladder. For choice, the grafting is done into the sigmoid flexure on the left side, and into the caecum on the right. In both cases, a method similar to Witzel's should be followed (see Fig. 148). The bad results that may follow grafting into the boicel are stenosis, with consequent hydronephrosis (which may occur after any of these plastic operations), infection by the bacillus coh communis, and infective peritonitis. In cases such as extroversion of the bladder, in which the natural ureteral orifice exists and can be grafted bodily into the rectum, the result may be excellent (see Chap. XLI.).

AFFECTIONS OF THE THORAX 240 piecemeal by cutting-forceps. The lower and middle lobes may be reached by removal of the lateral and posterior parts of the sixth, seventh, and eighth ribs. At first, only a sufficient portion of the ribs should be removed to enable the condition of matters to be ascer- tained ; more may be excised if required. The ribs should be removed sub-periosteally. A temporary resection of a portion of the chest wall may also be done. In opening the pleura, only a small incision must be made at first. If the operation is done without differ- ential pressure, the lung must be brought up to the surface and held by stitches or by forceps as the pleura is opened more widely. If differential pressure is used, this is maintained as the pleura is opened, and raised to 7-9 mm. of mercury, which is the most convenient pressure for examinations of the lung. Powerful broad retractors (Fig. 63) are used to pull the ribs as far apart as possible. As the wound in the pleura is closed, the pressure is increased so that pneumo-thorax is diminished as much as possible. If a differential apparatus is not employed the patient should be turned over and the chest compressed. The superficial parts must be carefully sutured.

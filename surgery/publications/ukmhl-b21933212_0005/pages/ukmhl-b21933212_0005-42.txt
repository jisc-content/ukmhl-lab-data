AFFECTIONS OF THE PANCREAS 10 NEW GROWTHS. Tumours of the pancreas are not uncommon, the most common being carcinoma. Other tumours, such as adenomata, or, very rarely, sarcomata, may also be found. The most frequent seat of carcinoma of the pancreas is in the head of the gland, when it may compress the bile- duct and lead to jaundice. Should this be the case, cholecystenterostomy (connecting the gall-bladder with the duodenum) may give relief to the jaundice (see p. 57). When the tumour is large and compresses the pylorus, gastro-jejunostomy may be called for, but these growths gener- ally extend rapidly and are accompanied by great pain, and it is question- able whether the operation is worth while. Attempts have been made to remove the tumour, and when the latter is in the tail of the pancreas and is movable, it may be possible to do this. Tumours in the head of the pancreas practically involve total extirpation of the gland, and this is out of the question. Encapsuled tumours have been removed by tearing through the gastro-colic omentum, opening the peritoneum over the gland and shelling out the growth. It is well to remember that the tendency to imperfect coagulability of the blood—and therefore to serious bleeding after any operative interference—is always very marked in cases of cancer of the pancreas, especially when associated with obstructive jaundice. Therefore no exploratory operation should be done in these cases unless there is some definite prospect of improving the patient's condition.

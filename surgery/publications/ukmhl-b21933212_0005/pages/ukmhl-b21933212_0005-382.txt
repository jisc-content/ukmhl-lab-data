CHAPTER XXXV, 350 INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS OF THE URETHRA. Inflammations of the urethra may be divided into two great groups: namely, venereal and non-venereal urethritis; the former being far the commoner form. GONOCOCCAL URETHRITIS. This is the name given to venereal urethritis due to a specific organism—■ the gonococcus of Neisser. This is a small coccus which occurs in pairs or groups of pairs, the opposed surfaces of the cocci being somewhat flattened. In the urethra the gonococci are present in the substance of the mucous membrane and in the epithelial cells. In the discharge they are found especially in the pus cells, some of which are crowded with the cocci during the acute stage. They occur also outside the cells, but in fewer numbers. They stain readily with aniline dyes, but are decolorised by Gram's method, and they may be cultivated, although with some difficulty, outside the body. Other organisms are often found in gonorrhceal pus, but the gonococcus has been clearly shown to be the specific cause of the disease, the others being of secondary importance, although they may help to keep up the inflammatory condition. Among these are the ordinary pyogenic cocci, and it is probably to them rather than to the gonococcus that suppurative complications, such as suppurating bubo, are due. The gonococcus especially attacks the urethral mucous membrane, but it may grow on the rectal or buccal mucous membrane to a slight extent ; it flourishes well on the conjunctiva. It may be carried to other structures, such as the various synovial or serous membranes, and set up inflammation in them. It is very difficult to extirpate the gonococcus from the male urethra, and in women it may remain for a long time more or less dormant in the folds of the mucous membrane of the cervix uteri under certain circumstances. Great care is necessary in diagnosing a case of urethritis as gonococcal,

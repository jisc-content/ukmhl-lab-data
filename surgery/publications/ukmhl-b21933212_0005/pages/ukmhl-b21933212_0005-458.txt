426 SECTION III.—AFFECTIONS OF THE BLADDER. CHAPTER XLI. CONGENITAL ABNORMALITIES OF THE BLADDER. EXTROVERSION OR ECTOPIA VESICA. In this condition, the deformit}^ varies from complete absence of the anterior wall of the bladder and the abdominal wall in front of it, together with wide separation of the pubic bones, to a small defect in the region of the neck of the bladder. In the male, complete epispadias and a rudimentary penis are usually associated with it, while in the female the urethra may also be split. It is apparently more frequent in the male than in the female ; in the former, the testicles may be imperfectly descended, and congenital hernia is not uncommon. In complete extroversion, the red, thickened mucous membrane of the posterior wall of the bladder protrudes beyond the level of the surface of the abdomen, showing the ureteral orifices at the lower part just behind the root of the penis. The urine undergoes ammoniacal decomposition, which leads to irritation and ulceration of the skin around, with deposi- tion of phosphates ; the exposed mucous membrane becomes inflamed and hypertrophied, bleeds readily, and is often papillomatous and ulcerated. The muscular coat of the bladder is very defective, so that practically nothing intervenes between the mucous membrane and the peritoneum but a little loose cellular tissue. Patients with extroversion may live for years, but death frequently occurs in early puberty from sepsis spreading up the ureters. THE! ATMBNT.—This may be either palliative or operative. Pallia- tive treatment consists in the use of an apparatus, such as Irving's (see p. 419), fitted over the exposed bladder so as to conduct the urine into a urinal, and great care is necessary to keep the parts clean and prevent decomposition of the urine and the deposit of phosphates.

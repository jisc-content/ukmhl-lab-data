DIVISION IV. 259 - s 2 THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE GENITO-URINARY ORGANS. SECTION I.—AFFECTIONS OF THE PENIS, SCROTUM, AND TESTIS. CHAPTER XXIII. PHIMOSIS AND PARAPHIMOSIS : CHANCROID OR SOFT SORE. PHIMOSIS. This is a condition in which the prepuce cannot be drawn back over the corona glandis ; it may be congenital or acquired, and varies in degree from cases in which the orifice of the prepuce is so tight that the meatus urinarius cannot be exposed at all to those in which it is only the base of the glans that cannot be uncovered. Congenital phimosis.—In the congenital form the chief trouble is at the preputial orifice—i.e. the iunction of the mucous and cutaneous surfaces. Adhesions are nearly always present between the prepuce and the glans and may be firm and dense—so that when they are separated a raw surface is left—or so slight that the two structures maybe separated without causing any bleeding. In some cases the difficulty in retracting the prepuce may be entirely due to these adhesions, and not to the narrow- ness of the preputial orifice. The prepuce is generally unduly long, and in some cases the orifice of the urethra is also contracted. The condition is accompanied by an accumulation of smegma beneath the prepuce, which may give rise to some irritation from its mere presence, but does not necessarily cause balanitis unless pyogenic organisms find entrance. Infection is, however, almost certain to occur as the child grows older, and then severe balanitis may occur. Difficulty

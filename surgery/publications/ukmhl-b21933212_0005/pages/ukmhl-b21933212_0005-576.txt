544 CHAPTER LIII. THE INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS OF THE PERI-NEPHRIC TISSUES, THE KIDNEY, AND THE URETER. The inflammatory affections that come under the care of the surgeon are practically all of a suppurative character, and may be divided into three classes: peri-nephric inflammation, pyelitis and pyonephrosis, and pyelonephritis. PERI-NEPHRIC INFLAMMATION. Non-suppurative inflammation of the tissues around the kidney may occur in connection with inflammation in the kidney itself, such as pyonephrosis or tuberculosis, and may give rise to adhesions between the capsule of the kidney and the tissues around ; this affects the question of nephrectomy, but does not of itself call for any special treatment. The important cases are those of peri-renal abscess. Abscess in the peri-renal region may be due to various causes, some of them independent of disease of the kidney ; when they arise in connection with renal disease they may or may not communicate with the interior of the kidney or its pelvis. Hence we may classify peri-renal abscesses into three groups ; those independent of disease of the kidney ; those which occur along with inflammation of the kidney, but in which there is no communication between the abscess and the interior of the organ ; and those in which the peri-renal abscess is due to a fistulous communication between the interior of the kidney and the fatty capsule. Peri-nephric suppuration, independent of renal disease, may follow injuries such as a blow on the loin, a strain, or a punctured wound not involving the kidney. Sometimes the only history is that of a chill preceding the development of the symptoms. Abscesses in this region may also result from extension of inflammation from neighbouring parts such as the appendix, the pelvis, the colon, the duodenum, or the gall- bladder. Peri-nephric abscess may also occur in the course of some general septic condition or of a specific fever ; it is not a very uncommon sequela of pneumonia.

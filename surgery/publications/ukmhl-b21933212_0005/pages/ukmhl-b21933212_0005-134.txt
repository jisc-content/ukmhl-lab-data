CHAPTER IX. THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE THYROID GLAND. ATROPHY. The thyroid gland may be imperfectly developed or completel\7 absent in infants and then the condition, known as ' cretinism,' results. Atrophy of the thyroid gland is also not uncommon in adults and gives rise to the disease known as myxoedema. Operations in which the thyroid gland is completely extirpated also give rise to myxoedema. That all cases of apparently complete extirpation of the thyroid gland are not followed by this affection, is probably explicable on the view that some part of the gland has been left behind, as even a very small portion may be sufficient to prevent the occurrence of this condition, as is shown by the absence of this disease as a result of the present practice of leaving a portion of the posterior part of the gland in aU cases of thyroidectomy. The symptoms and treatment of myxoedema do not properly belong to a surgical work; medical text-books should be consulted. INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS. ACUTE THYROIDITIS. Acute inflammation may occur in a normal thyroid or in one which is enlarged from other causes. It may follow injury or may be associated with rheumatism ; more frequently it occurs in connection with .septic conditions, especially pyaemia. It may also follow acute specific fevers, such as typhoid fever. Inflammation is not uncommon after puncture of a thyroid cyst, or the injection of a goitre when the antiseptic pre- cautions have been insufficient. The inflammation may end in resolution or lead to localised or diffuse suppuration in the gland. An abscess is I02

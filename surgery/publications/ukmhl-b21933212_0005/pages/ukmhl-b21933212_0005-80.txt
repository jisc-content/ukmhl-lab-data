AFFECTIONS OF THE LIVER 48 suture around the incision and some distance from it, and then to introduce a drainage tube of glass or india-rubber, invert the wall of the gall-bladder beyond the suture, and tie it tightly around the tube (see Fig. ii). This suture holds long enough for adhesions to form ; Fic. II.—Cholecystostomy. Drainage by means of a glass tube secured by a pursc- slring suture. This is the simplest and quickest way of ensuring a water-tight drain. The absorbable catgut suture should be stout and tied as tightly as possible round the waist of the glass tube. when it cuts its way out and the tube becomes loose, a track will be established through which bile may flow without any risk of passing into the abdominal cavity. It is well to leave the ends of the suture long so Fig. 12.—Cholecystostomy. Drainage by Kadcr's method. The stout rubber tube is first tied in by a single stitch. Then the purse-string suture is inserted as shown. As this is tightened and tied, the tube is pushed in so as to form a funnel- shaped depression; when the suture is tied, this gives rise to the characteristic nipple-like projection of the wall of the gall-bladder inwards. as to insure its subsequent removal. The drainage tube should be long and pass through the dressings, and its end is inserted into a bottle which is attached to the bandage on one side of the patient, and into this the bile is drained direct without soiling the dressings, at any rate for the

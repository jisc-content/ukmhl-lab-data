252 AFFECTIONS OF THE THORAX of the organ have been excised for tumour, but the results are not encouraging. Those interested in the subject should consult the special monographs dealing with the surgery of the lungs. DERMOID CYSTS OF THE MEDIASTINUM. These tumours, of which there are several cases on record, originate in the mediastinumâ€”usually in front of the great vessels. They are generally unilocular cysts, and may be noticed in youth or early adult life. As they increase in size, they exercise pressure on and cause dis- placement of the adjacent structures. On X-ray examination, a dark shadow is seen. They may extend up into the neck, and not uncommonly suppurate. Spontaneous rupture may occur into the bronchi or trachea; or through the skin, leading to a permanent fistulous opening. The treatment is difficult, and consists in excision, which may, however, be incomplete, and, if so, the result is not satisfactory, as a fistula, from which the contents of the cyst and pus escape, is usually left after operative treatment. In a few cases the cyst has been completely extirpated.

59 BILIARY FISTULA When the fistula is due to kinking of the cystic duct or the neck of the gall-hladder or to stricture, the abdomen should be opened, the fundus freed from the abdominal wall, and cholecystectomy performed, the cystic duct being removed with the gall-bladder (see p. 50). In doing this, great care must be taken to see that only the cystic duct is removed and not a portion of the common duct where the cystic duct joins it. 3. When the fistula is due to want of closure from faulty suture after cholecystostomy, a laparotomy should be done, the fundus separated from the abdominal wall, its edges pared, and the wound in the gall-bladder closed by Lembert's sutures in the ordinary fashion. The sutured gall- bladder should then be dropped back into the abdomen, drainage being provided down to the seat of operation (see p. 47). 4. When the fistula is due to a stone impacted in. the co)ninon duct, abdominal section should be performed and choledochotomy undertaken. Should that prove impossible, cholecystenterostomy may be done. 5. When the fistula is due to the occlusion of the common dud bv a neiv groivth, the tumour will probably be malignant and hence the advantage to be gained from operative interference for the cure of the hstula, which could only take the form of cholecystenterostomy, does not counterbalance the risks. A biliary fistula due to this cause should rarely be met with as, when the abdomen has been opened and a malignant growth occluding the common duct has been found, it will be better either to leave the case alone or to perform cholecystenterostomy at once in preference to cholecystostomy. When the fistula follows stenosis of the duct due to rupture from injury and subsequent cicatricial contraction the outlook is better, as. although it may be impossible to render the duct patent again, the flow of bile may be diverted from the fistula into the intestine by performing cholecystenterostomy and closing both ends of the divided duct.

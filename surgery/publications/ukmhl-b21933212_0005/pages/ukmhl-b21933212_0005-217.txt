185 CARCINOMA major, with the breast lying over it, should then be raised from the chest along with the underlying fascia, thus exposing the external inter- costal muscles and the anterior surface of the pectoralis minor. In doing this the attachment of the pectoralis major to the lower ribs will be divided, and at the upper part several large branches of the thoracic axis and of the external anterior thoracic nerve will be seen ; the Fig. 53.â€”Amputation of the Breast for Carcinoma. Cliai iiig the axilla. The insertion of tlie pectoralis major has been divided and the muscle cut away from the thoracic wall. The pectoralis minor has been hooked up and the fat, fascia, and glands have been dissected down from the apex of the axilla. nerves should be cut short and the vessels clamped before they are divided. The elbow should now be raised and brought a little forward so as to relax the tissues, and the clavicular portion of the pectoralis major is drawn upwards and away from the chest so as to expose the space beneath it ; the fat and fascia should be carefully dissected away from the under surface of the muscle, care being taken to preserve its nerve supply. The fascia is next divided along the inner border of the pectoralis minor, thus exposing the outer edge of the costo-coracoid

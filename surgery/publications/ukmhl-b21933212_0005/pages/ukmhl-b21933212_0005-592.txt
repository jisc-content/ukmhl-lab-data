CHAPTER LV. 560 RENAL AND URETERAL CALCULUS : SUPPRESSION OF URINE : RENAL FISTULA. RENAL CALCULUS. Renal calculi may be formed in the uriniferous tubules, the calyces, or the renal pelvis. The commonest form consists of uric acid ; next in order of frequency come those of oxalate of lime, then those composed of urates and, much more rarely, phosphate or carbonate of lime, cystine or xanthic oxide calculi. The so-called ' secondary calculi' that are deposited in a diseased kidney are mainly composed of phosphates and carbonate of lime. The nucleus of the calculus may be crystalhne or may consist of blood-clot, mucus, or caseous material. When septic changes occur in the urine, alkaline phosphates are deposited and form an outer coating to the calculus. The calculi may be multiple or single ; oxalate of hme stones are generally single. They may be rough or smooth, roundish or oval, or branched corresponding with the calyces of the kidney. The stone may be movable or fixed; massive branched calculi are usually fixed, whereas the small round ones may move freely in the renal pelvis, and cause temporary obstruction to the flow of urine by blocking the orifice of the ureter. Calculi are sometimes embedded in the renal parenchyma. Calculi may occur simultaneously in both kidneys or in one organ after the other ; they are, however, most often present on one side only. They are not common between twenty and forty years of age, and are quite rare in children. A sedentary life, debility, the use of hard drinldng-water, excesses in diet, inflammatory conditions of the renal pelvis, or septic conditions of the urine in the case of phosphatic calculi, are amongst the chief causes. They are said to occur most often in dyspeptics and neurasthenics, and are more common in males than in females.

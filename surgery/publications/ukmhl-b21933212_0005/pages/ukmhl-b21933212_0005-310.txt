AFFECTIONS OF THE PENIS 278 severe. In that case the object of the amputation is merely to get rid of the local disease and so allow the patient to micturate in comfort. In cases in which amputation of the penis is considered unadvisable, either owing to the extent of the disease or to other causes, the patient, if he suffers much on micturition, will be relieved by a median perineal section (see p. 348); it is a good plan in these cases to expose the urethra, divide it, and then isolate the proximal end and bring it out into the perineal opening. This will not only obviate passing urine over the surface of the growth, but will avoid any necessity for the use of a perineal catheter, as there is then no tendency for the perineal wound to close ; moreover, urine cannot find its way along the penile urethra to the growth. After any of these operations in which the opening of the urethra is made in the perineum the patient may be provided with an apparatus (see Fig. 69) which consists of a sort of scoop to which is attached a short tube. It enables the patient to micturate standing up ; he places the instrument between his legs and passes his water into it, the urine being carried away by the tube. It can be conveniently carried in an ordinary tobacco-pouch. Fig 69.â€”Apparatus for use apter complete EXTIRPATION OF THE PeNIS.

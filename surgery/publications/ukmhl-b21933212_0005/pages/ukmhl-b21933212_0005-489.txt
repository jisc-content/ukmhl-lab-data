CHAPTER XLV. 457 NERVOUS AFFECTIONS OF THE BLADDER. NOCTURNAL ENURESIS, OR INCONTINENCE OF URINE IN CHILDHOOD. This condition lias nothing in common with incontinence of urine met with at other periods of Hfe, and may be divided into several groups :— (a) True nocturnal enuresis.—In these cases there is perfect control over the bladder during the day, while enuresis occurs at night. The condition is probably always nervous in origin, and the act of micturition is purely reflex, being often caused by some psychical phenomenon, such as a dream. (b) Nocturnal enuresis with imperfect control during the day.—Here the patient is obliged to empty the bladder in the daytime immedi- ately the desire is experienced. This condition may be due to several causes, the commonest of which is some peripheral irritation, such as phimosis, congenital narrowing of the urethra, vesical calculus, or worms in the rectum. (c) Enuresis both by night and by day,—The probable cause of this condition is inability of the sphincter vesicfe to resist the passage of urine directly the bladder begins to be distended. In extreme cases, the sphincter is paralysed, and the urine dribbles away as fast as it is secreted, and there is therefore true incontinence ; as a result, the bladder becomes permanently contracted and not distensible. This condition is not uncommonly met with as a result of a previous over-distension of the bladder, such as may occur during specific fevers. Incontinence of urine associated with epileptiform convulsions is one of the most common forms of nocturnal enuresis in the adult male, and Trousseau held that all forms of nocturnal enuresis in adults are due to epilepsy ; micturition usually occurs at the end of the fit. Enuresis may, however, occur in the early stage of locomotor ataxia. The prognosis is very good except in the last form, and a cure is practically certain to result, though the affection may last a long time.

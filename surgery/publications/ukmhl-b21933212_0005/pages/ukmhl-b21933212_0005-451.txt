SIMPLE ENLARGEMENT 4ig drainage should be free. The large tube may be removed about the fourth or fifth day and a smaller one substituted for a few days longer. About this time, an Irving's supra-pubic box (Fig. 112) may be substituted for the dressings. If this is properly applied and fits the patient, he should be absolutely dry. The box must be removed and cleaned at least twice daily. The skin should be smeared thickly with Lassar's paste, or 40 grs. of oxide of zinc to the ounce of lanolin, in order to prevent irritation. After-treatment.—The patient should be kept recumbent for the first twelve hours after the operation and then placed in a sitting position. Shock following the operation is treated on the lines laid down in Fig. 112.—Irving's Supra-pubic Drainage Apparatus. Vol. I. p. 117. Stimulants and saline solution may be given as required. If there is severe pain or restlessness, heroin (gr. yV to gr. J) or morphine (gr. i to should be administered. At the end of the third day, a purgative should be given, and the bowels must subsequently be opened daily. Plenty of liquids are given for the first day or two, and hght solid diet may be commenced after the bowels have been moved. It is not advisable to pass a catheter per urethram until ten or fourteen days have elapsed ; any irrigation of the bladder which may be necessary should be carried out through the supra-pubic wound. As a rule, urine will begin to pass per urethram about the third week, after which the fistulous opening will soon close. Complications.—Hemorrhage.—This may continue for some days. If the irrigation with hot saline solution does not stop it, ergotinine citrate (gr- 1 ,TTT. hypodermically) or calcium lactate (gr. x, every four hours) may be given. In a few cases, secondary haemorrhage has occurred, and if E E 2

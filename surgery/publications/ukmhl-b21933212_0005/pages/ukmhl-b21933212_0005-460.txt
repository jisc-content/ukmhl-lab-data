428 AFFECTIONS OF THE BLADDER has taken place (see Vol. I. p. i6o) ; one end is then detached and the flap turned into place. When this has united, a second flap is formed in the same manner, and, if necessary, still another, until the anterior surface of the bladder is covered in (see Fig. 114) ; finally, the epispadias Fig. 115.â€”Plastic Operation for Ectopia Vesicae. First stage. A catheter has been passed into each ureter and the bladder wall dissected away from the peritoneum and retro-peritoneal tissues. This is done until about half of the bladder is freed, as shown in the figure. The peritoneum is then opened along a line which corresponds to the base of the flap at the stage shown in the figure. The patient svas a female child. is repaired. Several cases operated upon by this method have given fairly satisfactory results, but of course a urinal has to be worn constantly. In the other type of plastic operation the edges of the bladder are dissected up and sutured together. In Segond's operation, the upper part of the mucous membrane and submucous tissue is turned down and stitched to the lower edge, which has been also detached and turned up

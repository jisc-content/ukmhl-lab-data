AFFECTIONS OF THE PROSTATE 422 dilating the compressor urethrse and the prostatic urethra. The staff is withdrawn, and the right forefinger introduced along the gorget; very considerable force is often required to introduce the finger in these cases as the neck of the bladder is tightly contracted. The gorget is now withdrawn and the left forefinger is passed into the rectum. The mucous membrane on the floor of the prostatic urethra is split in a back- ward direction by the finger in the urethra working against the finger in the rectum, and the whole ring of the prostate is detached until the neck of the bladder is free and the finger passes in and out quite easily. As large a perineal drainage tube as the passage will take easily is stitched in, and the patient returned to bed. The tube is removed in two or three days, and the patient allowed to get up and move about freely. There is often incontinence for some days after the removal of the tube, but this soon ceases, and the patient can retain and void his urine spontaneously.

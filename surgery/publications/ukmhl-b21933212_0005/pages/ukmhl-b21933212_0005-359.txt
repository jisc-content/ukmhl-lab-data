327 HYPOSPADIAS C B the flap up to the free edge (see Fig. 78, B). This incision should extend just through the skin, and it will then be possible to pull apart the edges and open out the lax tissues so as to produce the condition shown in Fig. 79 ; this should be done with as little actual cutting of the tissues as possible. The next proceeding consists in passing stitches so as to slide in skin from the preputial flaps and thus cover tlie whole of the raw area with skin, part of which will ultimately line the new urethra. It is well to begin by passing a stitch through the glans (see Fig. 79), so as to hold the organ straight before passing these sutures. The first Fig. 80.â€”Urethroplasty for Hypospadias.

It will usually be found that the points c, c (see Fig. 79) will be sutured to the raw surface just below the stitch a, which has been passed through the glans. The appearance when all these stitches have been passed is seen in Fig. 80, A. The remaining raw edges of the prepuce are now stitched to those on the lateral aspect of the glans by a row of sutures. This completes the second stage of the operation, and, when the wounds A

AFFECTIONS OF THE BLADDER 452 TREATMENT.-â€”This is not particularly satisfactory. If there is any definite lesion of the alimentary tract, such as appendicitis or colitis, it should receive appropriate treatment. Diuretics, such as citrate and carbonate of potash, and urinary antiseptics, such as urotropine or cystopurine, are of some value, although they often fail. Sometimes good results are obtained by the use of an autogenous vaccine in increasing doses. Locally, daily instillations of antiseptics, e.g. I to 2 drams of i in 5000 perchloride of mercury solution, or a weak solution of nitrate of silver (J per cent.) are recommended. If there is any pus in the urine, the case should be treated as one of chronic cystitis.

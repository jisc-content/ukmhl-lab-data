CHAPTER II. INJURIES OF THE LIVER AND BILE-PASSAGES. SURGICAL ANATOMY OF THE LIVER. In the healthy adult, the inferior margin of the liver corresponds on the right side to the costal margin, and crosses the epigastrium on a level with a line drawn from the tip of the ninth rib on the right side to that of the eighth left costal cartilage, and then passes upwards and to the left to reach a point near the apex-beat of the heart ; at the linea alba it lies nearly midway between the sternum and the umbilicus. The level of the upper surface may be indicated by a line drawn from the base of the xiphoid cartilage to the right fifth rib in the nipple line, curving downwards to the sixth rib in the mid-axillary line and then backwards to the eighth dorsal spine. The limits of the right pleural cavity are of importance, especially in connection with puncture of the liver or the opening of hepatic abscesses. In front, the pleura descends to a point just behind the right seventh costal cartilage near the sternum, whilst in the right mid- axillary line it is two or three inches above the costal margin. Behind, it may extend just below the twelfth rib. By removing the tenth rib in the mid-axillary line the pleura can be avoided and the diaphragm exposed. The relation of the peritoneum to the liver.â€”The latter structure is not covered by peritoneum posteriorly, and an abscess in that situation may therefore be reached without traversing the peritoneal cavity. The peritoneum is reflected from the under-surface of the diaphragm on to the convexity of the liver posteriorly, as the anterior layer of the coronary ligament, and passes over the anterior surface of the organ and roimd its lower margin until it reaches the transverse fissure, where it is re- flected downwards in front of the structures in the portal fissure to form the anterior layer of the gastro-hepatic omentum. To the right of the portal fissure it becomes continuous with the peritoneum in 11

538 AFFECTIONS OF THE KIDNEY AND URETER of the tube has been lost as to render this impossible, grafting the proximal end of the ureter into the bladder or the bowel, or bringing it out on the skin, must be had recourse to. Ureteral anastomosis. — The different methods of uretero-ureteral anastomosis are founded on Fenger's experiments, and may be divided into four groups : (a) transverse end-to-end union ; {b) oblique end-to- end union ; (c) end-in-end union ; and {d) lateral implantation. End-to-end anastomosis, whether transverse or oblique, consists of union by Lembert's sutures. Leakage is, however, very apt to occur, Fig. 146.—Van Hook's Method of Uretero-ureteral Anastomosis by Lateral Implantation. The two left-hand figures show the appearance of the ureter when the anastomosis is complete. The X on the second figure is the point at which the ligature emerges from the lower end and is tied. {Morris.) and stenosis is almost certain to follow. End-in-end operations are only applicable when the ureter is much dilated, the plan being to puU one end of the ureter into the other and secure it by sutures. Lateral implantation is the method which apparently gives the best results, and the one which we shall describe, as the surgeon must be acquainted with it, and may have to carry it out in an emergency. Van Hook's, method is in the first place to ligature the distal portion of the ureter about a quarter of an inch from the divided end. A longitudinal incision is then made below this ligature with sharp-pointed scissors, the length of the incision being double the diameter of the tube. The proximal end of the ureter is slit up for about a quarter of an inch ; this enlarges its opening, and therefore allows for subsequent contraction. Two needles, threaded on a single catgut thread, are then passed from

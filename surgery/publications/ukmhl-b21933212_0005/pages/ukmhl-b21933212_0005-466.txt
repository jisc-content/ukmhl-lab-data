434 CHAPTER XLII. INJURIES OF THE BLADDER. OPEN WOUNDS. Open wounds of the bladder, as distinguished from lacerations or ruptures, are most commonly met with in military surgery; in civil practice they usually follow falls upon some sharp object, such as a spike, which either traverses the abdominal wall or the pelvic outlet. The bladder may be wounded in operations, such as excision of the rectum, hyster- ectomy, or operations for femoral hernia, or portions of the organ may be removed designedly, as in cases of malignant growth. In all these cases there is an external wound in the region of the bladder from which urine escapes continuously ; under such circumstances the only alternative diagnosis to wound of the bladder would be wound of the ureter. TREATMENT.—The treatment of these injuries must be directed firstly to the repair of the damage to the bladder wall, and, secondly, to the provision of drainage so that urine shall not collect in the peritoneal cavity or the pre-vesical cellular tissue. The first thing to do is to expose the seat of injury thoroughly. When the bladder has been wounded accidentally, or intentionally, during the course of an operation, the seat of the injury will be exposed to view, the edges will be cleanly cut, and the obvious pro- cedure is to suture them at once (see p. 437). In the case of accidental wounds, the procedure wiU depend on the situation and the nature of the injury, especially on whether the injury affects the extra-peritoneal portion of the bladder or whether it communicates with the peritoneal cavity, and also on whether it is a clean-cut or a contused wound, such as may be caused by a bayonet or a buUet. In any case, the bladder should be exposed from the front, and if a communication with the peritoneal cavity is found, the abdomen should also be opened. When the opening is more or less clean cut—as in punctured wounds—it should

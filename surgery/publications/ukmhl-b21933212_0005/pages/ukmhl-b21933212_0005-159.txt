INJURIES OF THE LARYNX 127 over the crico-thyroid space, its edges are well retracted, the muscles are separated, the crico-thyroid membrane is opened by a transverse incision, and a suitable laryngotomy tube (see Fig. 29) is inserted. At the same time the surgeon should enlarge the incision upwards, expose the alse of the thyroid cartilage, bring the fractured portions into apposition and secure them by a few catgut sutures. As a rule the laryngotomy tube can be left out after five or six daj^s. WJien there is no impediment to respiration, it is unnecessary to have recourse to any active treatment if the patient can be kept under close observation. A suitably moulded poroplastic collar should be worn, and union takes place readily. Should cedema of the glottis supervene, intubation of the larynx or tracheotomy (see p. 134) may be called for. Should the patient be so situated that the surgeon is not readily available in case urgent symptoms arise, it will be safer to perform tracheotomy (see p. 134) in the first instance, or at any rate immediately on the appearance of the slightest swelling.

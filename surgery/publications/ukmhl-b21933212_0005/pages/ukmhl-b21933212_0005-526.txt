AFFECTIONS OF .THE KIDNEY AND URETER involved. The following points are of use: Pain—especially the char- acteristic kidney pain—shooting down the ureter and into the groin, when constant and referred to one side only, practical^ points to that side as the seat of disease. It is stated that pain may be referred to the side opposite to that affected, but it is very doubtful whether the whole pain of the patient is ever so referred, and indeed whether pain is even really present on a side where the kidney is healthy. Further evidence is obtained by palpation of the kidney ; in some cases the presence of an increased amount of pus or blood in the bladder, after palpation of a particular kidnejr, may indicate which side is diseased. In cases of doubt, examination of the ureters and the orifices by the cystoscope should always be undertaken, and is of the greatest help.

INJURIES OF THE GALL-BLADDER AND BILE-DUCTS 19 communication established between the gaU-bladder and the intestine may lead to septic infection of the bile-passages. We should prefer not to perform this operation at the time the duct is sutured, but, havmg united the duct and provided free drainage, to wait and see whether union of the common duct occurs. Should this happen, the cure will be complete, while, should union fail and a biliary fistula persist, cholecystenterostomy may be undertaken for its cure as a secondary operation.

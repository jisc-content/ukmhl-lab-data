580 CHAPTER LVI. HYDRONEPHROSIS. Two varieties of this condition may be met with: namely, persistent hydronephrosis and the intermittent form. PERSISTENT HYDRONEPHROSIS. Distension of the pelvis of the kidney may be due to various catises, chiefly such as produce obstruction to the escape of urine from the kidney. This must be incomplete at first, as sudden and complete obstruction to the flow of urine leads to atrophy' of the kidney rather than to hydronephrosis. The most common seat of the obstruction is in the ureter, and this may be congenital or acquired. Narrowing of the ureter may be congenital, but, as a rule, the typical chronic hydronephrosis is due to some obstruction which forms after birth. Any interference with the escape of the urine from the pelvis of the kidney may give rise to hydronephrosis, provided that the obstruction is not complete from the first. This may be due to blocking of the lumen of the ureter by calcuh or tumours ; to inter- ference with the flow of the urine by kinks, twists, or valvular obstructions; to thickening of the wall of the ureter as the result of inflammation, which may be simple and lead to strictures, or tuberculous ; to pressure on the ureter from outside—usually by tumours, such as a uterine cancer; or to causes situated lower down in the urinary tract—-such as stricture of the urethra, enlarged prostate, or tumours in the bladder pressing on or involving the ureteral orifice. The condition may be unilateral or bilateral. In the majority of cases it is unilateral, but in a certain number, and especiaUy when it is caused by a tumour in the pelvis, it is bilateral, although it is then generally more advanced on one side than on the other. A smaU hydro- nephrosis is a comparatively common condition, but large hydronephrotic tumours are much rarer, for, unless there be some outlet for the urine,

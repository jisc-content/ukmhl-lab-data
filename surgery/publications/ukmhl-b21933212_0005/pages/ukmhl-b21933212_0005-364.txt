332 AFFECTIONS OF THE URETHRA c e in Fig. 86. The raw surface of this flap is then folded on itself so as to cover the ventral aspect of the penis with skin, and the wound in the scrotum is closed with a row of sutures. The terminal portion of the urethra is completed at a subsequent operation, either by turning over the prepuce, if there is enough of this structure left (see Fig. 87), or by some other means, such as that shown in Fig. 88. This deformity is the reverse of hypospadias; the upper wall of the urethra being deficient. It is much rarer than hypospadias and; although Fig. 89.—^Thiersch's Operation for Epispadias. /, Incisions for raising two flaps, abdc and eflig.

This diagram also shows how buried sutures are avoided, and yet the flaps are properly secured. the cleft may be limited to the anterior part of the urethra; it commonly extends into the neck of the bladder and is usually associated with ectopia vesicas (see p. 426). In the complete form of the affection, true incontinence of urine is present, but when the cleft is limited to the anterior part of the urethra, the patient may retain control of the urine. The penis is usually curved upwards by fibrous bands passing from the symphysis pubis to the middle line of the dorsum of the penis, and the patient suffers from even more disability than in the corresponding degree of hypospadias. TREATMENT.—This resembles that for hypospadias. The slighter forms of the deformity, in which the urethra is cleft only where it passes through the glans, do not call for operative interference.

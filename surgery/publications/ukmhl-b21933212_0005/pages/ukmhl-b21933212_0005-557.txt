NEPHROPTOSIS OR MOVABLE KIDNEY 525 at the outer end, and running across the kidney rather below its centre. The capsule is now stripped off as far as the outer border and lower end of the kidney, so as to form two flaps, the greater part of the posterior surface of the organ being thus decapsulated (see Fig. 143). The fatty capsule and these flaps are held out of the way while the kidney is turned back and placed exactly in the desired position on the posterior wall Fig. 142.â€”Anterior Retro-peritoneal Nephrope.w. The rectus is shown exposed by the division of its sheath so as to allow the peritoneum to he opened and the abdominal viscera examined. of the abdomen. The capsular flaps are then stitched to the muscles around the outer and lower border of the kidney, so as to keep the raw posterior surface of the organ in close contact with the muscles ; the peri-renal fascia is also stitched down at the lower part so as to form a shelf, which gives additional support to the lower end of the kidney (see Fig. 144). The peritoneum is allowed to fall back in position, and a few stitches will bring the deeper muscles together, while the edges of the external oblique are brought together by mattress sutures and subsequently by a continuous stitch.

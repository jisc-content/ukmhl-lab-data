FOREIGN BODIES 349 upwards towards the abdomen. An incision is made in the middle line of the perineum over the instmment; this incision should be from an inch to an inch and a half long and terminates about half an inch in front of the anus. The urethra is opened by cutting upon the end of the groove, the edges are seized with catch-forceps and held aside, and the instrument withdrawn ; the foreign body can generally be seen by the aid of a good light, and may be grasped in forceps and removed without any damage to the urethral mucous membrane. The urethral incision may be left to close spontaneously, or it may be approximated by a few fine catgut sutures. We prefer the latter method, and do not leave a catheter permanently in the bladder, but pass a No. 8 gum-elastic instrament every six hours for the first two or three days so as to draw off the urine. This can be done without risk to the union of the incision in the floor of the urethra if care be taken to keep the point in constant contact with the roof as it is passed along the canal. No sutures are inserted in the skin-wound ; an antiseptic dressing is merely applied over it, and after the third day the patient may be allowed to micturate naturally.

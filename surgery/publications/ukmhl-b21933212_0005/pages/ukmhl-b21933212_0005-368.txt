336 CHAPTER XXXIII. INJURIES OF THE URETHRA. Owing to its protected position, the urethra is not often the seat of penetrating wounds, but these may occur if the patient falls astride a sharp object. The most common injuries are contusions or rupture of the urethra without a wound of the skin. Damage done to the urethra by the passage of instruments is more appropriately dealt with in connection with stricture of the urethra (see Chap. XXXVII.). PUNCTURED AND INCISED WOUNDS. Punctured wounds usually only require simple dressing. Healing is rapid and satisfactory, and the cicatrix does not give rise to trouble from contraction. The treatment of incised wounds varies according as they are parallel or transverse to the long axis of the urethra. In the former case the wound does not gape, and it is merely necessary to clean it up and see that the opening in the skin is sufficiently free for drainage ; catgut sutures may be used to keep the edges of the urethra together, but they should not penetrate the mucous membrane. The patient is allowed to micturate naturally. In these cases there is Uttle tendency to subsequent stricture as the cicatrix is in the long axis of the canal. If, however, the wound is transverse or oblique to the long axis of the urethra, a stricture will occur unless the cut edges are accurately united. A full-sized sterilised red-rubber catheter should be passed into the bladder, if possible—or at any rate down to the seat of the injury—and then the urethra should be exposed by a free longitudinal incision through the soft parts over it. The cut edges of the urethra are indentified and accurately united with fine absorbable catgut, the urethra being freed if necessary so as to allow the edges to come together without tension. The sutures should be passed in Lembert's fashion, avoiding the mucous membrane ; the soft parts superficial to the urethra, and the wound in

GOlTRE 109 and fastened beneath the chin. The superficial structures below the incision are also freed in a similar manner as far down as the top of the sternum. During this part of the operation, care must be taken not to exert any pressure upon the tumour or the larynx so as to avoid interference with the breathing. The next point is to divide the deep cervical fascia in a vertical direction in the middle Ime, until the true capsule of the growth is exposed (see Fig. 26). If this is done in the middle line, little bleeding will occur. Care must be taken only to carry the incision down to the capsule of the gland and not through the latter, otherwise the bleeding may be embarrassing. The presence of the thin-walled veins will indicate that Fig. 26.â€”^The vertical incision in the deep fascia in Thyroidectomy. When the tumour is very large it may be advisable to substitute a free transverse incision through muscles and fascia for the one shown above. the capsule has been exposed. The finger is now slipped in beneath the infra-hyoid muscles and can, with very little aid from the knife, readily peel the fascia and muscles off the lobe of the thyroid and expose it freely. Any veins divided should be immediately clamped. The infra-hyoid muscles should be raised from the isthmus on both sides of the middle line ; on the side on which the lobe is to be left they need not be further detached ; on the side from which the lobe is to be removed the muscles should be peeled well outwards ; they may be very much thinned and flattened when the tumour is large and care must be taken not to tear them. Should the swelling be very large, it may be necessary to divide them a little below their origin and turn the ends out of the way, suturing them together subsequently at the end of the operation. At this stage there is practically no bleeding ; only a few small veins require clamping. The clearing of the lobe to be removed should be continued with the

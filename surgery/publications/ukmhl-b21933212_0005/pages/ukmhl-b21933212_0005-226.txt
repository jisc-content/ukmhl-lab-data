194 SECTION II.â€”AFFECTIONS OF THE THORAX AND ITS CONTENTS. CHAPTER XVI. FRACTURES OF THE RIBS, COSTAL CARTILAGES, AND STERNUM. FRACTURE OF THE RIBS. These injuries are most common during adult life ; when growth is complete, the ribs become less elastic and the cartilages more ossified and brittle, and fracture is therefore more likely to follow comparatively slight violence than in the young in whom the ribs are more elastic and may bend without breaking. Fractures of the ribs are more common in men than in women, and may be due to either direct or indirect violence. The seat of a fracture from direct violence corresponds to the point of application of the force, and the ends of the bones are driven inwards and the inner surface of the rib is more spHt up than the outer. Unless the violence is severe or the rib is fractured in more than one place, the elasticity of the bone causes it to resume its normal outline almost immediately; but before this occurs, the sharp edges may have lacerated the intercostal vessels or punctured the pleura or the lung when they were driven in. The commonest cause of fracture of the ribs is, however, indirect violence causing compression of the chest from before backwards or from side to side. Under such circumstances the ribs are bent beyond their limit of elasticity, and give way at the point of greatest stress. In antero-posterior compression, which is the commonest form of injury, the fracture occurs either about the mid- axillary line or at some point between that and the angle of the ribs. In this form of fracture the broken ends of the bone bend outwards, and the deeper structures are rarely injured except when the thorax

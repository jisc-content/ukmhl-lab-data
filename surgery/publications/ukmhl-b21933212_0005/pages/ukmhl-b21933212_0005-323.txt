291 u 2 CHAPTER XXVIII. INJURIES AND INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS OF THE TESTIS. INJURIES. The treatment of punctured or incised wounds of the testis is similar to that of wounds in generaL CONTUSIONS. When the testicle is bruised, ha;morrhage occurs beneath the tunica albuginea ; if much blood is effused and cannot escape, complete atrophy of the testis may follow. After the accident there is rapid swelling of the organ, accompanied by intense pain, some collapse and nausea. In bad cases the pain is so severe as to cause the patient intense agony. In some cases the tunica albuginea may be split and the testicular substance may bulge out through the rent, and blood may accumulate in the tunica vaginalis and form a hcematocele. TREATMENT.â€”In slight cases the application of iced lotions or an ice-bag may be suiticient, but if there is much extravasation it is essential to allow the blood to escape in order to avoid atrophy of the testis. This is readily done by means of an incision through the tunica albuginea, made by a tenotomy knife introduced through the scrotum over the body of the organ. This allows blood-clot or oozing blood to escape, and healing is rapid. When a hiematocele is present, and persists, it should be opened up (see p. 319), and if a rupture of the tunica albuginea is present it may be stitched up with catgut sutures. LACERATED WOUNDS. When a lacerated wound of the scrotum involves the testis, the best treatment in most cases is to remove the organ at once, as the testis

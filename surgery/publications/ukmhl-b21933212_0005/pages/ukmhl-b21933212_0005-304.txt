AFFECTIONS OF THE PENIS 272 GANGRENE OF THE PENIS. This is of very rare occurrence, and is practically always of the moist variety ; the most usual causes are constriction of the organ by some unyielding substance—such as a ring or a hgature, very tight paraphimosis, or extravasation of urine following a calculus impacted in the penile urethra. It may also occur after specific fevers, such as typhoid or smallpox, and in connection with diabetes, alcoholism, or Bright's disease. TREATMENT.—-When the gangrenous patch is small and not spreading, the penis should be disinfected and boric fomentations appUed until the sloughs have separated, after which skin-grafting may be required to cover the raw surface left. When the whole thickness of the organ is affected, it may be necessary to amputate the penis (see p. 274) well above the line of demarcation or to open the urethra in the perineum and establish a permanent opening in that situation. INDURATIONS OF THE CORPORA CAVERNOSA. Extensive localised indurations of the corpora cavernosa may be met with and lead to difficulty in erection or to lateral deflection of the organ, accompanied by much mental distress to the patient. These indurations may follow injury or be due to gummatous infiltration, but in most cases no cause can be traced. Microscopic examination shows an increase of fibrous tissue accompanied by endarteritis. Except for the local inconvenience, the condition is not serious. TREATMENT.—Operative interference is useless in these cases, because the scar produces the same inconvenience as does the thickening, and, moreover, it does not check the spread of the induration. Good results may, however, be obtained by the use of radium; but in order to obtain these, 100 milligrams should be employed and kept in contact with the indurated patch for about eighteen hours.

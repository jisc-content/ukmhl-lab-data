SECTION II.—AFFECTIONS OF THE URETHRA AND PROSTATE. CHAPTER XXXII. CONGENITAL MALFORMATIONS OF THE URETHRA. These conditions are rare; the most important are hypospadias, epispadias, and complete or partial occlusion of the urethra. Abnormal communications between the urethra and the rectum are described in Vol. IV. Chap. XXXIV. CONGENITAL STRICTURES. Congenital strictures of the urethra are met with in various situations ; for example, the stricture may be situated at the external meatus, in the penile portion just behind the ossa navicularis, or close to the prostatic urethra, and it usually takes the form of a valvular fold or diaphragm. In the adult, the meatus will normally admit a No. 12 Enghsh bougie, and in children of two or three years it should admit a No. 4 or 5 ; if this is not the case, the meatus must be considered unduly narrow. Narrowing of the external meatus is not uncommon in conjunction with phimosis; in all cases in which circumcision is performed, the meatus if too small, should be enlarged. The irritability of the bladder, for which circumcision is often performed, may be really due to this cause and when the symptoms are not relieved by circumcision, the reason 322 Fig. 76.—The method of enlarging an unduly small Meatus. In the left-hand figure, the director is shown introduced into the meatus. In the right-hand one, the meatus has been slit up and the sutures inserted.

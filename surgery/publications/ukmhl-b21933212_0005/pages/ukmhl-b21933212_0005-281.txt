CHAPTER XXI. 249 PULMONARY ACTINOMYCOSIS: HYDATIDS OF THE LUNG AND PLEURA: NEW GROWTHS OF THE THORAX. PULMONARY ACTINOMYCOSIS. This is a rare affection, and may result from inhalation of the fungus, by extension of the disease from the oesophagus or other adjacent organs—such as the liver—or as a result of embolism. In the early stages, the symptoms are obscure, but as the disease spreads from the lung to the pleura and thence to the chest wall, the probability of accurately diagnosing the condition increases. It may be recognised comparatively early by the expectoration of the characteristic fungus; in other cases it may not be diagnosed until the chest wall has become involved and sinuses have formed, giving the characteristic discharge. TREATMENT.—These cases have been treated with more or less success partly by the administration of large doses of iodide of potassium, and partly by opening up the mass and scraping it away as completely as possible with a blunt spoon or with the aid of the diathermic cautery. These masses are often extremely vascular, and there may be much difficulty with haemorrhage so that the surgeon may have to plug the cavity firmly in order to arrest the bleeding, unless the diathermic cautery is employed. Repeated scrapings will probably be necessary. By resection of the chest wall, indurated masses in the lung may be excised when the disease is localised. HYDATIDS OF THE LUNG AND PLEURA. Hydatid disease is not very uncommon in the lung ; from 7 to 12 per cent, of all cases of hydatid cysts occur in that organ, and the cysts are met with especially in the lower lobe of the right lung. The disease may commence primarily in the lung, or may be secondary to the bursting of a hydatid of the Uver through the diaphragm into the pleural cavity,

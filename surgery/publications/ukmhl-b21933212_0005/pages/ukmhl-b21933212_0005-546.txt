514 AFFECTIONS OF THE KIDNEY AND URETER LAVAGE OF THE RENAL PELVIS. In a few cases of intractable pyelitis, lavage of the renal pelvis has been followed by cure. A solution of boric acid, nitrate of silver (i in 8,000), or protargol (i in 1,000) may be used. The ureteric catheter is passed, and the contents of the pelvis run off. The solution is instilled very slowly by means of a ureteric catheter syringe, about one half-dram being used at a time, and the fluid then allowed to flow out. The lavage may be repeated once a week.

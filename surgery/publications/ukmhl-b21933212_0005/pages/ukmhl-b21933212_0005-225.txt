CARCINOMA 193 in the breast, it is unnecessary to remove more than the lower mass of glands from the axilla, and the dissection need not extend upwards above the pectoralis minor. DUCT PAPILLOMA AND DUCT CARCINOMA. Papillomata may form small tumours projecting into the galacto- phorous ducts and blocking them so as to give rise to dilatation behind. They bleed readily, and one of their symptoms is the escape of a clear or bloody discharge from the nipple. On examining the breast in the early stages nothing may be discovered, but a small tumour may generally be felt later on beneath the nipple or areola. It is quite im- possible to diagnose a duct papilloma from a duct carcinoma in the early stages, although the latter may be suspected when the discharge always contains blood ; later on, the carcinoma forms a larger tumour and follows a course similar to that of the ordinary form of cancer, though it is apparently less malignant. TREATMENT.â€”In all cases the part of the duct involved should be excised if it can be localised, and if examination of the specimen removed shows it to be simply a pedunculated papilloma projecting into the duct, the surgeon may be content with the local removal ; should there be any evidence that the epithelial elements are infiltrating the tissues around, however, the case will be one of duct carcinoma, and the surgeon should at once proceed to remove the breast completely. A rapid section, cut and stained at the time of the operation, is of great value in deciding this point. If the case is seen at an early stage, an exception may possibly be made to the ordinary rule of removing the axillary glands at the same time, but if the disease has extended beyond the wall of the duct or if there is any sign of enlargement of the glands in the axilla, the complete operation for cancer of the breast should be undertaken (see p. 181).

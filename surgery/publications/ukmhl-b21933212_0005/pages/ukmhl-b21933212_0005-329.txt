INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS thrust through the scrotum, and the tunica albuginea is incised for about an inch downwards from the globus major; care should be taken to avoid injuring the epididymis. In some cases several small stab-wounds into the testicle will be sufficient. The exudation which remains in the body of the testis after the acute attack is smaller and less persistent than that met with after acute epididymitis. In acute orchitis, however, the surgeon not infrequently has to deal with suppuration, which is uncomnron in epididymitis. The onset of suppuration may be inferred when the temperature is high and irregular, the pain continues in spite of rest, the swelling increases, and the oedema of the scrotum becomes more marked. Should pus form in the epididymis, a fluctuating spot soon betrays the existence of an abscess, but in orchitis it is often a long time before the tunica albuginea softens sufficiently to allow the abscess to come to the surface. As soon as the existence of an abscess is certain, it should be evacuated, and, as a rule, healing occin's without a hernia testis. Occasionally, however, it will be necessary to perform castration—especially in cases of septic inflammation of the body of the testis with numerous small scattered abscesses—both because evacuation of one abscess may not relieve the others and also in order to avoid the risk of general septicaemic infection. Under these circumstances the best plan is to divide the cord above the scrotum, and remove the whole of the affected area along with the testicle without opening the abscess.

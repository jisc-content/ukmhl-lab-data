579 RENAL FISTULA through the thin wall of the pelvis itself. If, on the other hand, it has been done for a tuberculous and septic pyelitis, it will not close unless the tuberculous disease has been cured, and the only method of getting rid of the fistula is by nephrectomy ; indeed, in some of these cases, the drainage is only a temporary measure preparatory to a nephrectomy. When the fistula is due to an accidental wound of the pelvis of the kidney, and the organ itself is healthy and the ureter patent, it is probable that, if the sinus does not close after the establishment of efficient drainage, it may be cured by cutting down on the kidney, and stitching up the wound in the renal pelvis. When the fistula is due to disorganisation of the organ from suppuration or from tuberculous disease, nephrectomy is clearly indicated, if the condition of the opposite kidney permits. Before determining on nephrectomy, it is of the highest importance to ascertain the condition of the opposite kidney, and also whether the urinary fistula is completeâ€”that is to say, whether all the urine from the affected kidney passes through the loin. These questions are discussed in Chap. L.

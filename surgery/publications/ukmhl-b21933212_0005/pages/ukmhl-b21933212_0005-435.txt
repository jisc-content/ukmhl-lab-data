403 INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS made on the prostate in the downward direction; after two or three sittings, the pressure may be increased. At first the massage may be done every second or third day, and finally daily. In long-standing cases, tonics—such as iron and nux vomica—should be given in combination with ergot (lll^x-I1\xx of the liquid extract, three times a day) ; sea-bathing or a sea voyage are often useful in young men who have had gleet for a prolonged period and are much run down in health and spirits. It is well to pass a full-sized, well-warmed bougie every third day; this dilates the prostatic urethra, and squeezes out superficial collections of mucus from the orifice of the glands. In all these cases, the vesiculae seminales should be examined per rectum, because if they are inflamed, the prostatic condition will not get well until the vesiculitis has been cured (see Chap. XL.). Vaccines prepared from the organisms present may be employed. Gouty prostatitis.—Prostatic irritation may be connected with gout. The attack generally occurs at night, and there is urgent painful micturi- tion, the urine being very acid and depositing urates and mucus in large quantities. The prostate is very sensitive for a time, and retention of urine may occur. The treatment is mainly that for the milder forms of acute prostatitis combined with the administration of drugs suitable for gout, and the affection reachly subsides.

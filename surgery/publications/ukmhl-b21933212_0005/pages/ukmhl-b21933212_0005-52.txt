20 CHAPTER III. ABSCESS, HYDATIDS, AND TUMOURS OF THE LIVER. ABSCESS. The only inflammatory affection of the liver coming under the notice of the surgeon is hepatic abscess ; suppuration in the gaU-bladder is dealt with separately (see Chap. IV.). Suppuration in the liver may take the form either of small multiple abscesses scattered through the organ, or of one, or at most two or three, large circumscribed collections of pus. The small multiple abscesses are practically always associated with pyaemia, either general or portal (suppurative pylephlebitis), and, as surgical measures are of no value in these cases, we need not discuss them further. The larger circum- scribed abscesses, however, are of great importance, and may be divided into two groups : namely, those met with in temperate climates and resulting from the various causes enumerated below, and those associated with dysentery—the true tropical abscess. Suppuration in the liver sometimes, though rarely, occurs without any apparent cause—the so-called ' idiopathic abscess '—and is due to micro-organisms which probably find entrance by way of the portal vein. In the great majority of cases, however, a primary cause may be traced. Liver abscess may be associated with injuries of the head ; here the infective material apparently spreads, not in the form of true emboli, but by the micro-organisms present in the blood, which locate themselves in the liver. Pylephlebitis—which occurs in connection with septic processes, such as appendicitis or ulceration of the bowel affecting the terminals of the portal vein—may give rise to septic emboli and multiple abscesses. Foreign bodies, such as needles that have found their way into the liver, injuries to the organ, or sepsis following injuries to other organs or operations in the portal area—such as those upon the rectum— are well-known causes of the affection ; among others may be mentioned parasites in the bile-ducts. Suppuration in the liver may also arise in

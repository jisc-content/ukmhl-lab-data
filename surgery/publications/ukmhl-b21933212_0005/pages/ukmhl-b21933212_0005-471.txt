On the one hand, there is apt to be irritation of the bladder and sepsis if a catheter is tied in ; Fig. 121.—Repair of a laceration of the Bladder e.xtending into the Peri- toneal Cavity.

Then the rest of the peritoneum is closed and tiie extra-peritoneal portion of the laceration is sutured. on the other, there is a possibiHty of leakage under the strain of passing water if no catheter is employed, and the variations in size of the bladder as it becomes distended and empties itself may cause the stitches to cut through.

CHAPTER XXVIL 284 ABNORMALITIES IN THE DESCENT OF THE TESTIS. Abnormalities in the descent of the testis may be divided into two large groups, in one of which the testicle has not descended sufficiently far {retained testis), while in the other the organ has found its way into some abnormal position {eolofia testis). RETAINED TESTIS. The testis may be arrested in any part of its course from the back of the abdomen to the bottom of the scrotum ; the condition may be unilateral or bilateral. When the testes have not passed out of the inguinal canal, the funicular process of peritoneum which descends with them is practically always open; and therefore the majority of cases are complicated by a congenital inguinal hernia. Even when a hernia is not actually present at first it is always liable to occur later on. When the testicle has not reached the scrotum, that side of the scrotum is usually imperfectly developed. Undescended testes are seldom developed properly, and some hold that they are functionless when they lie in the inguinal canal ; this, however, is not definitely proved, and in any case it would appear that if they are brought down into the scrotum sufficiently early in life they may grow and become active. When the testicle is retained in the inguinal canal, various abnormal conditions may arise. Besides the possibility of becoming functionally useless, the testicle is liable to attacks of acute inflammation not only from causes that give rise to a similar condition in the normally placed organ, but also from the pressure to which the displaced organ is subjected, and from the greater liability to injury from sudden movementsâ€”such as violent flexion of the hip-joint and blows or kicks on the groin. There is, moreover, a special tendency for the testis to undergo partial or complete torsion, so that the cord becomes twisted and the organ may have its blood-supply so gravely interfered with that it becomes gangrenous.

CHAPTER XXXVII. 398 INJURIES AND INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS OF THE PROSTATE. INJURIES. Injuries from external violence are very rare, and are usually caused by falls upon pointed instruments or by severe contusion of the perineum ; the prostate may also be injured during the passage of instruments into the bladder. The chief dangers of these injuries are extravasation of urine and septic infection, the latter being particularly prone to occur owing to the large size of the venous prostatic plexus. TREATMEHnTT.-â€”The main points in treatment are to provide free drainage and to take measures for securing asepsis of the urine. When the injury is due to severe contusion of the perineum, there may be so much swelling around the urethra as to render drainage of the bladder by a catheter difficult, and it wiU then be best to perform a median perineal section (see p. 348), and drain the bladder by a perineal tube. This may be left out in ten days or a fortnight, a catheter tied into the bladder through the urethra (for details see p. 342), and the perineal wound allowed to heal. Should the prostate be very severely damaged, it may be difficult to pass a catheter, or even to find the way into the bladder after a perineal section ; under such circum- stances, the best plan is to open the bladder above the pubes, when the vesical orifice of the urethra can be identified, and a bougie passed downwards through the urethra, to which a catheter may be attached and pulled up from below (see p. 342). Urinary antiseptics (see p. 446) should be given and the bowels kept freely open; morphine and belladonna suppositories may be required for the relief of pain. INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS. Inflammation of the prostate may be either acute or chronic, the acute form affecting either the glandular foUicles or the organ as a whole. When suppuration occurs, the abscess is sometimes peri-prostatic.

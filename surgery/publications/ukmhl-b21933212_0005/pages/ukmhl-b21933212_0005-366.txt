AFFECTIONS OF THE URETHRA 334 The final stage consists in connecting the proximal end of the new urethra with the bladder, and for this purpose Thiersch uses flaps fashioned as shown in Fig. 90. The edges of the defect are pared and the first flap (a) is turned with its epithelial surface downwards so as to lie in the triangular space, to which it is stitched. The second flap is made to cover the raw outer surface of the first. The raw surfaces from which the flaps are raised may be aUowed to heal by granulation or can be skin-grafted. The difficulty about this operation is to secure union if urine is allowed to pass along the new urethra before healing Fig. 90.â€”Thiersch's Operation for Epispadias. This shows the final stage, iu which the new urethra is connected with the orfice at the neck of the bladder. /, shows the two flaps, a and 6, marked out. In//, the flap, a, is reflected and sutured to the pared edge of the new urethra, so that its raw surface is outside. In ///, this is covered in by the flap, b, which has its cutaneous surface outside. is complete, and the best plan is therefore to make a button-hole opening in the perineum, insert a tube through it into the bladder, and drain the organ in this manner for the first five or six days. The tube is left out when union of the flaps is complete and the perineal openmg is allowed to close. The chief objection to this part of Thiersch's operation is that the reflected flap carries with it hairs which grow into the urethra and may cause trouble from the deposition of phosphatic concretions upon them. Radium or X-rays should therefore, in the first instance be employed so as to depilate the part ; the depilation, however, is often only temporary.

283 TUMOURS EPITHELIOMA SCROTI. This disease has received the distinctive name of ' chimney-sweep's cancer,' but it appears not to be Hmited to this trade, as it occurs also in paraffin workers, and in others in whom the scrotum is hable to irritation from the material in which they work. Cliimney-sweep's cancer usually manifests itself as a small, hard, warty scrotal growth, covered with a firm scab, and increasing very slowly at first. It may be several years before it assumes active growth ; but, however slow its early stages may be, a period comes at which it assumes the characters of an ordinary epithelioma, and it is then followed by rapid enlargement of the inguinal glands and general dissemination. TREATMENT.â€”Early and free excision must be carried out as for malignant disease elsewhere ; any suspicious warty surface on the scrotum should be removed freely even though there may be no history of rapid growth. The incision should be elliptical and go at least an inch wide of the base of the tumour in all directions ; the whole thickness of the skin and dartos should be taken away. Castration may be necessary if there is any adhesion of the scrotum to the testis, but in ordinary cases this is not required. The inguinal glands on the same side as the tumour should be extirpated. There is nothing special in the treatment of this affection except to bear in mind that the apparently benign character of the growth in the early stages should not mislead the surgeon as to its true nature.

298 proportion to the otiier. To obviate certain diffi- culties, nature has wisely ordained a peculiarity of structure to the foetal cranium, the mechanism of which is so admirably formed, that its head is less compact than that of the adult, the cranium being connected by synneurosis or ligamentous sutures, forming fontanels which are more yield- ing and numerous, consequently are better adapted for the head passing through the windings of the pelvis, than if they had been firmly joined together. The growth of the foetus varies very much dur- ing the different stages of utero-gestation. The embryo increases more rapidly in size in the first weeks of conception, than after it acquires the fcEtal state, though this increase is supposed to have various stages of irregularity till gestation be completed. Few accoucheurs have had opportunities of ascer- taining with precision the diversified growth of the foetus in the earlier periods of its developement. According to Soemmering, we find that the increase of the foetus does not observe any uniform ratio. During the first weeks after conception its increase is most rapid, during the second month a little arrested in its growth ; increased during the third, and in some degree retarded at the commencement of the fourth ; from the latter end of the fourth to the sixth increased, from which period till gestation is perfected, the growth is not

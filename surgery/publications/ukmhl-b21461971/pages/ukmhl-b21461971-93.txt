85 stone from two patients by the High Operation, when I could not effect the same in periueo, by the Lateral Method; and 1 never yet met with an instance where the High Operation was performed, and the patient could not be freed from the stone thereby, though it had in some cases been very large." M. Deschamps relates a successful case of the High Operation after a failure by the me- thod in perineo. The advantages attending the High Operation. 1. _It is attended with less pain, and generally performed in less time than the Lateral Operation. 2. No danger from haemorrhage or risk of wounding the pudical artery. 3. —,]Vo fear of wounding the rectum, or in- jm'ing th(i seminal ducts. 4. —No wound inflicted either on the prostate gland, or neck of the bladder. 5. —Whatever be the size or situation of the stone it may more readily be extracted by the High than by the Lateral method. 6. —No fear of being plagued with a fistula, or incontinence of urine.

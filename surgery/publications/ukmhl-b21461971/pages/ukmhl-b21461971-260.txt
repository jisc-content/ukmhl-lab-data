250 tions, I may be allowed to suggest the propriety of establishing it as a general rule of practice, that every possible means of resuscitation be as- siduously employed for some time, after all visible signs of life have disappeared, or as long as the body retains the least degree of warmth. In some perverse instances, I have found the adhesion of the placenta to the uterus so firm and complete, as to appear on examination to be only one viscus, in which case, if neither flooding nor other untoward circumstance occurred, I deemed it proper to withdraw my hand and wait till the natural contractions and expulsive efforts returned, after which the placenta might be in some degree disengaged from the uterus. Tf in such circumstances, extraction be found neces- sary, the operation will be more easily accom- plished, and the patient will be exposed to less risk, than if undertaken in the first instance, prior to the recurrence of uterine action, and while the two organs are so firmly connected together. Philip Pue, a celebrated accoucheur of Paris, in bis Prax. Obstetr. 2. Chap. ยง 2, relates an instance which happened in his own practice, when being called to perform the Caesarean Section on a pregnant woman, whom he supposed to be dead, on cutting the integuments of the abdomen, he perceived, though too late, a trembling of the woman's body, and evident motion of her legs, and grinding of her teeth. This mistake he ob- served, so filled his mind with terror that he vowed never m fa- ilure to attempt the like operation.

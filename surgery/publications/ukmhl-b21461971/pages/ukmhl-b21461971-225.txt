We may look upon a passive state of the uterus as a frequent cause of flooding and which requires unceasing attention in the ac- coucheur. Notwithstanding this precaution, the placenta will sometimes be eventually retained in the uterus and a part of the mass become putrid, which may be known by the fetor of the discharge and distention of the uterine region, in which case the hand may be conducted into its cavity, and the whole of the placenta scooped out of its recess. In order to excite uterine contractions and pre- vent heemorrhage, the hand should be still retained in the cavity, as a stimulus, and kept moving against its internal surface till that organ has fully

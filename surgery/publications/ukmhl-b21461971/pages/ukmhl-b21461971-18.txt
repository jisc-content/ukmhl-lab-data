10 WG are enabled to explain the diversified symp- toms so pften equivocally manifested in the mor- bid affections of the bladder and the neighbouring parts. Such an assemblage of muscular and ner- vous actions is formed in this part of the system, as to occasion a frequent exposure to pain and disease, and therefore to require the most prompt and judicious treatment. Indeed no subject in the whole circle of surgical science appears of greater importance than lithotomy and the diseases associ- ated therewith; nor is there any which renders more necessary a competent view of the anatomy of the parts in all their bearings ; an accurate knowledge of which is indispensably requisite, when con- templating an operation of such vast moment. There is a progressive evolution which cha- racterises the human body ; and various diseases invade certain parts of the system as life advances, though in their first stage they ai^6 of a latent and obscure nature : none however appear more fre- quently than morbid affections of the prostate gland. This progressive change of organic struc- ture is perpetually acting on the living body, and appears inseperable from human growth and de- cay. The prostate gland and neck of the bladder, from their vascular texture and situation, are per- haps more exposed to disease than most other parts of the system from pecuhar causes : among which are high living, constipation of the bowels,

187 with wliich the fa?tal head descends through its apertures during the process of natural labour; tlie cranium of the foetus being composed of several distinct and separate flexible bones con- nected by synneurosis, its membranes become com- pressed and overlay one another, consequently the volume of the head is materially reduced in its dimensions,^^ in proportion to the force of ttterine action, and the opposing obstacles whicii accompany labour. This agency is accomplished by the reiterated action of the uterus, which forces the edges of the bones of the cranium over each other without injury to the child or mother ; which effect in the reduction of bulk, could not possibly take place, vifs . the cranium had been formed of one solid bone, or the pelvis had been differently constructed. The distinctive marks which so manifestly characterize the difference be- tween a male and female pelvis, must arise fi om the intentions of Providence in furnishing the fe- male with a frame so admirably adapted for the safety of the child during labour, as well as her be- ing qualified in other respects to become a mother. The cavity of the female pelvis, when exempt from disease, is much more capacious than that of the male, the perpendicular dimensions greater, as also the ti ansverse diameter. The crista of the ilia and the tuberosities of the ischia, are likewise more expanded outwards,

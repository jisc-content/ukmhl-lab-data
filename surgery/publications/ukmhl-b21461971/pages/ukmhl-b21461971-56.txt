48 danger; whilst, on the other hand, a sound con- structed similar to that represented in the annexed plate, with a small bulbous point, adapted to the natural diameter of the urethra, and that part of the instrument from the bulb to the handle, ipuph reduced below the ordinary size, will ma- afetly distend the urethra as it passes along its course, with comparatively little friction, much more ease and safety to the patient, as well as freedom to the surgeon; and on having entered the bladder it can be moved in any direction, with- out exciting undue irritation, or being embraced and obstructed by the action of the urethra and itSi coajutant muscles. Consequently the stone is more readily found by this instrument, than one of an equal diameter throughout. There are two methods of treating calculous affections of the bladder described by authors. One is radical, by the surgical extraction of the stone ; this is the operation of Lithotomy. The other is palliative, by administering lithontriptic medicines in different ways, with a view of dis- solving it in the bladder. Notwithstanding the attention of the faculty to the method of chemical counteraction, it is but too true, that hitherto aill attempts have proved ineffectual. Though the dissolution of calculi in the urinary bladder has been attempted long ago by means of medicines internally, as well as by

408 the liand or hands wlieii presenting at the brim of the pelvis by means of a plug, till the head of the foetus had pressed that aperture. Those who are acquainted with the dimensions of a well formed pejvis, and its relative apertures of adaptation to the head of the foehis, must, be aware that the pelvic cavity, if divested of its soft parts, would generally exceed the diameter of the fcetal cranium and integuments by at least a quar- ter of an inch, which provision of nature mani- festly renders the trifling impediments caused by the transmission of the hand in union with the head of little moment. For if the capacity of the pelvis did not invariably exceed the bulk of the head during its progressive evolution at birth, the labour would be inevitably tedious. These re- spective adaptations of structure and capacity connected with the winding irregularity of the cavity, appear intended as subservient to the up- right position of the human body, and mate- rially obviate many casualties which would unavoidably await the the gravid female, were the pelvic apertures augmented much beyond their natural standard. Among the evils which the unnatural extent of the capacity and dimensions of the pelvis would create, are the premature descent of the fcEtus in utero, ?l prolapsus of the unimpregnated uterus, relenlion of urine, and laceration of- the

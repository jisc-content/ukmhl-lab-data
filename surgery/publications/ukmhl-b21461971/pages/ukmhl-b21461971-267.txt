257 III. ON'the MOllBID AND PRETERNATURAL ADHE- SIONS OF THE PLACENTA TO THE UTERUS. The morbid attachment of the placenta to the uterus is fortunately not a frequent occui-rence. From its peculiar vascular structure, and suspen- sion in a cavity, exposed to the vicissitudes and evolutions consequent on the phenomena of men- struation and gestation, it is less subject to disease than at first view would appear probable; never- theless it occasionally happens that the functions of this organ become interrupted, and assume a scirrhous or cartilaginous state; and in some more rare and inveterate instances, an ossification of the blood vessels takes place. Where these ma- ladies exist during a state of gestation, the pla- centa may be suspected to partake in some degree of the same diseased structure and condition; in which state it is obvious that so formidable an obstacle, opposed to the separation of the pla- centa, will be proportionate to the extent and dejjree of the diseased attachment. In some instances of morbid adherent placenta 2 k .

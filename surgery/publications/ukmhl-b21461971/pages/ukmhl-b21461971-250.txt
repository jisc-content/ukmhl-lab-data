240 Plugging-the vagina and nioiitli of the uterus completely willj lint, tow, or sponge soaked in a strong sohition of alum, with equal portions o( cold water and vinegar firmly supported by ihe T bandage, and by allowing the [)lug to remain a few hours in this position, keeping the patient cool and quiet in a horizontal posture. '^I'hus a coa- gnlum will probably form, and the haemorrhage cease. The bandage may then be removed, and the placenta and plug will be generally expelled at the same time, by the united eftbrts of the abdominal muscles and uterus. Should any flooding ensue, recourse may be had to replacing the plug, and adjusting the bandage as before- mentioned, and from its utility in checking ha;- morrhage, (particularly after premature births) I have frequently witnessed the most decided benefit. But when this is adopted after dv^^livery at full time, much caution will be required ; for the uterine parietes being more expanded and less disposed to contract after gestation is conq^leted, than in cases of abortion, and the bloofl vessels having poured out their contents into the uterine cavity, should the plug be fixed in the vagina, the uterus would be again distended, if the haemorr- hage be profuse, and thus its contraction wo\ild be prevented whether the evacuation proceed from arterial or venous sources, or both.

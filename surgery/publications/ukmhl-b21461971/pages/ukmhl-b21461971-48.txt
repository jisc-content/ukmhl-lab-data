40 Sir Everard Home has published ineasureinents, taken from casts, of the widths of the canal of t'he urethra, at different parts; but from the obser- vations 1 have been able to make, there is reason to believe that he has much overrated its diame- ters throughout when appHed to the living subject iu its natural state. When affected with inflam- mation the canal becomes manifestly diminished; and a bougie, or catheter of the ordinary size and construction, if passed far into the urethra, will have a greater friction upon its sides than one of a less diameter with a small bulb, the chief re- sistance to which is almost wholly confined to that part. On gauging the caliber of the pros- tatic portion of the urethra in the adult subject, I find the average diameter to be from four to five lines; and as the structure of this part of the urethra is less capable of distention than the othei-, it is obvious that the diameter of the catheter should be proportioned to it. The pain so frequently excited, and the per- plexity attending the introduction of any foi m of instrument into the bladder, when the patient is tortured with calculus, have been noticed by most practitioners who are versed in this branch of surgery; and it is a matter worthy of attention, and which thejunior practitioner should invariably bear in mind, that there is a considerable differ- ence between passing the sountf on the dead and

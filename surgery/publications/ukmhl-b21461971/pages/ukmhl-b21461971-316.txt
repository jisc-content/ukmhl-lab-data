306 have succeeded with safety both to mother and chihl with that instrument in several instances, where the Forceps had been previously tried with- out effect: and in others, where the precedhig births had been terminated with the Crotchet, in which cases no part of the superior aperture of the pelvis presented a space equal to three inches. I consider the living fatus a merely passive body during its passage through the pelvis; though after death, when putrefaction has taken place, it is well to bear in mind that the bones of the cranium and their connecting membranes will give way more readily, and pass through a less space than when alive. However, I am well aware that examples may be adduced where the head has undergone a greater reduction by compression than what has been above stated, without proving fatal; never- theless I would have it understood, that though there may be exceptions from this rule, yet the danger incurred will be proportionate to the yield- ing condition of the sutures, and length of time which the foetal head occupies in the passage: hence it is indispensably requisite to view the ad- measurement and dimensions of the pelvis and cranium of the foetus in conjunction with each other, in every state and under every modification of artificial assistance. Some difference may nevertheless result from

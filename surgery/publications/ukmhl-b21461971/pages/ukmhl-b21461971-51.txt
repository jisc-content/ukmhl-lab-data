With regard to the convexity of such instrument, every surgeon will perhaps find it most convenient to be governed by his own ideas and experience, as a dexterous operator will seldom fail of effecting his purpose whatever degree of curvature it may possess. A calculus, by its own weight, may be lodged near the cervix of the bladder, immediately be- hind the prostate gland, in which case a sound with a less curve than ordinary will more readily come in contact with the stone, and if it be lodged near the fundus, or in its anterior part, one more bent will generally detect the stone sooner. An indurated and enlarged prostate gland, pro- duces symptoms occasionally much like those of stone in the bladder.

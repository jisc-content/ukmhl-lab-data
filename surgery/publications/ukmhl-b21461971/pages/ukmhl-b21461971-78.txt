He practised lithotomy at ^Zexawrfna, during the time of Herophilus and Erasistratua; about 150 years subse- quent to the time of Hippocrates; and il/eg-ej likewise practised the Celsian operation at Rome, in the reign of Avgustus. We are indebted to Andreas de Cruce, for the invention of a pair of Forceps, for the purpose of breaking stones in the bladder; this instrument, we are told, failed of effecting this purpose, in the deplorable cases of the celebrated Archieter, and Professor Borrichius, who were cut for the stone, but it being too large to be extracted, they died in less than three weeks afterwards.

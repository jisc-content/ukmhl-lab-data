297 it, would be useless, since the clioice of the most proper methods for terminating the delivery in a given case, cannot depend on a line more or less in the diameter of the pelvis. According- to these data, the knowledge of this tliameter is easily obtained. " It is fom- inches when the external thickness of the pelvis measnres seven; it is but three when the latter only measnres six ; and but two when it does not exceed five, &c. I suppose the woman to be thin, as most of them are who have been ricketty." Though by the use of the Callipers a tolerable accurate gauge may generally be attained of the distance between the pubis and promontory oi" the sacrum at the superior strait; yet it must be acknowledged that this instrument affords veiy little advantage to the accoucheur, when applied to any other of the pelvic diameters : and in cases of exostosis the admeasurement will be equally uncertain when attempted at any given point of the concavity. Hence may be seen how much more limited this mechanical invention is in its application and use, than the fingers of the ac- coucheur when properly adjusted. In considering the descent of the fioetal head through the extended apertures of the pelvis, it- will appear manifestly necessary that the dimen- sions of the one should bear some mathematical 2 p

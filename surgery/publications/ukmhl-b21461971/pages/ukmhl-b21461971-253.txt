243 unnecessary or impracticable to effect the trans- mission of the contents of the ovum, and when the sanguineous discharge has been unabated for a long- time, the accoucheur may, with propriety, in addition to the fore-mentioned measures, have recourse to opium, astringent injections thrown up the vagina uteri, and cordials as auxiliary re- sources ; particularly if the sufferer be advanced in years, and the system much reduced. Spasmodic affections of the uterus present va- rious degrees of irregular contractions, and often prove embarrassing to the accoucheur, when occurring during the extraction of the placenta. In the longitudinal form of contraction, the fundus uteri assumes a state of atony, whilst the inter- mediate muscular fibres of that organ support a spasmodic action, and it becomes constricted in the middle in the hour-glass form; by which irre- gularity of contractile power and structure, the placenta, when attached to the fundus, gets en- cysted or lodged in the upper chamber beyond the second entrance. This compound and oblong form of contracted uterus, may be ascertained to extend its fundus upwards above the umbilicus, by the application of the hand on the hypogastric region, and its structure will appear to the touch as though it was encircled with a tight ligature, leaving a transverse sulcated impression on the part.

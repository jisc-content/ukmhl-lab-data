30;3 when the pelvis is ascertained to measure no more from pubis to sacrum, or in any other direction of the aperture at the brim than 2^ inches,* I am persuaded from long experience, that no mature foetus can possibly be extracted by any known mechanical power, through a space of these di- mensions without inevitable destruction to the child, and consequent risk to the mother. It will be evident from these facts, that it is in this inter- mediate degree of distortion (comprising not more than a quarter of an inch) betwixt the possibility of effecting delivery without injury to the mother or foetus with the Forceps or Lever, and that ex- tent of deformity which requires the application of the Crotchet, that premature delivery seems most likely to be advantageously produced. In such cases this method is preferable to the sacri- fice of a mature foetus by Embryulcia, whilst un- avoidably endangering the life of the parent. Here a question naturally presents itself to every accoucheur who deliberates on the subject; meter was ll inches, and the distance from the protuberance of one parietal bone to the other was reduced by pressure to nearly Ih, inches. Notwithstanding the degree of compression which the brain must have sustained by long continued action of the uterus, and though delivery was effected with the Lever, both mother and child recovered. Cases of this kind are vei-y rare, and form no general rule of practice. * Vide Synoptical Table at the end.

63 patient appear healthy and not plethoric, bleeding may be dispensed with, provided a few doses of purgative medicines, of the saline kind, be given occasionally for a few weeks before the operation. If, on the contrary, the patient be advanced in years, and greatly reduced by continued suffering, it may be proper to recommend a good nourishing- diet joined with rest, and if there is much pain he should be kept in a recumbent posture, with the pelvis raised so that the stone may m>t press on the neck of the bladder and cause irritation, or retention of urine. It is always proper, an hour or two before the operation, to administer an aperient enema to the patient to clear the rectum, lest its distention should expose it to injury. Let me, in this place, remind the lithotomist, that his chief aim ought primarily to be directed to the safety of the patient, whose constitution and habits should be minutely examined, and every symptom be well considered, before he resolve on one of the most important and eventful opera- tions in surgery, where even under the most promising circumstances there is always danger: and ultimately bear in mind, that the extraction of the stone is only one step towards effecting a cure, as the after treatment of the patient demands an equal share of attention from the surgeon as the former.

When the spasm which affects the funis is relaxed and flooding ensues, the ope- rator may have recourse to extracting the pla- centa at discretion, being governed in his steps by the urgency of the symptoms, and state of the pa- tient.

These different forms of spasmodic action of the uterus, have been observed by most writers on midwifery; and I am induced from long ob- servation to believe, that this morl)id uterine ac-

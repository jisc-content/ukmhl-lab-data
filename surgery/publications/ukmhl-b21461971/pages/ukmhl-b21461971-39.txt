31 The concealed situation of these parts, parti- cularly when combined with calculous aflections, the ambiguity of the symptoms, the associated action of the muscles of the pelvis, and the varying nature of the diseases connected with them, evidently shew the insidious progress and extent of such morbid phenomena; at the same time these causes account for the obscurity which marks the symptoms, and so often retards our efforts in determining the true mode of treat- ment. Though most surgical authors have enumerated various symptoms as unequivocal indications of the existence of stone in the bladder, yet the proofs which usually characterize the disease, are so extremely complex, that in this peculiar de- partment there is great difficulty in discriminating between the sympathetic affections of the bladder, and the genuine source of the disease. The operation of sounding the bladder for the purpose of discovering a stone, is in general so slightly noticed by surgical writers, that we might suppose it not of much importance ; but as we never can be certain whether there is or is not a stone, without the introduction of some instru- ment for this purpose, it is presumed no apology is necessary for these remarks ; more particularly when it is evident that such research cautiously made, frequently leads to the discovery of other

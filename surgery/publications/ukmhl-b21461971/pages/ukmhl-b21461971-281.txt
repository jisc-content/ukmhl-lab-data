271 after tlie birth of the first child, an hainiorrimge may follow and prove dangerous to the uterine foetus, or if one placenta be detruded, whilst the the other remains in the uterus, the woman would be exposed to flooding, and danger might fol- low ; because, occasionally the placentae adhere to each other, in which case, they have generally the chorion as a common investment. But each foe- tus possesses its distinct amnios, and they are most frequently united together by intervening mem- branes, so that the vessels of the one, anastomose with those of the other. In twin cases, when the term of gestation is completed, the uterus is usually more distended than when occupied by only one ovum and foetus, and if the extrusion of the placenta be artificially accelerated, and the secondary contractions of the organ do not follow in due time, haemorrhage will be the con- sequence ; as the diameter of the uterine vessels in these cases are more distended and -cai^not so readily contract as in single birth, where the uterine surface occupies a less space, and the muscular fiibres have not been too much ex- panded. The measures to be pursued on this occasion, must have for their object, the re-excite- ment of uterine action, and the adoption of the forementioned remedies both externally and internally, according to the exigency of the symptoms.

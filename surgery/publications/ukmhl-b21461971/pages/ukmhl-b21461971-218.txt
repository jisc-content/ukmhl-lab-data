On inspecting the state of the parts, 1 ob- served the uterus lying without the vulva, and the placenta firmly attached to its fundus, which organs reached midway to the woman's knees; fortunately, their^adhesion to each other was so complete, that little haemorrhage had ensued, this may be ac- counted for, by the inversion taking place so soon after birth, and before the uterus was allowed to act and separate from the placenta. Upon reflecting a few moments on the nature ot the case, and the impossibility of a body like this, the magnitude of which exceeded that of the head of the child, repassing through the neck of the uterus, I, without delay, grasped the whole substance between my hands and by uniform pressure, con- tinued for a few minutes, the blood oozed out, and it became considerably diminished. I then separated the placenta from its attachment to the uterus, and effected its reposition, by placing the points of my fingers against the fundus, and pushing it through its neck, and the inverted vagina, till the whole hand had completely passed the superior aperture of the pelvis, and entered into the proper cavity.

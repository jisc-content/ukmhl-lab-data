64 ON THE OPERATION OF CELSUS, OR THE APPA- RATUS MINOR, USUALLY CALLED THE LESSER APPARATUS. OR CUTTING ON THE GRIPE. The Celsian method of operating for the stone is the most ancient species of lithotomy with which we are acquainted; and though we are greatly indebted to this author for the minute description he has given of it, it is generally believed that he was not the original inventor. Yet it appears to have been the chief mode of operating practised by the Greeks and Romans, during the space of sixteen centuries, and till the apparatus major became known. Various conjectures have however been ad- vanced by authors, respecting the exact method in which Celsus operated, but he describes it nearly as follows: " Since (says he) after the body being duly prepared the patient must walk about, that the stone may descend towards the neck of the bladder, which will be known by introducing the fingers after the manner I shall hereafter mention in describing the operation: when thus assured that the stone has fallen down, the boy being made to fast for one day, the opera- tion must be performed in a warm place as follows.

163 much obscurity, as the latter-mentioned author confesses in his observations on this disease ; and in which he seems also to lament the want of a systematic arrangement of these morbid affections. " If an arrangement (says Mr. Abernethy*) of tumours was once made, so that the history of each species could be particularly marked, we might perhaps be able, from this circumstance, to form a probable opinion of the nature of the tumour, 3ind of the mode of treatment which it would require." Here then we may pause, while so able a phy- siologist is left to doubt on the possibility of clas- sification. Hence I am disposed to believe, that the distinguishing characters of most tumours are so equivocal in their nature and structure, that they can only be determined and arrested in their pro- gress by an attentive observation of their situation, texture and symptoms; consequently any mode of treatment founded on mere classification must be precarious and uncertain. Thus situated, let us then seek for information by an observance of the physiological analogy which exists between the exuberances in the vege- table, and those of the animal kingdom, and en- * Mr. Abernethy, in his work on tumours abotc alluded to, has nevertheless aUcrapted a tlassificalion.

88 oil all occasions would, I conceive, be wrong, for each has its advantages (like many other sur- gical operations) of being peculiarly adapted to a distinct mode of operating, according to cir- cumstances. It is evident that stones of a mag- nitude too large to be extracted by the lateral method, may, without difficulty, be removed by the Hypogastric section; and as the danger at- tendhig the former is generally in proportion to the si2;e of the stone, I feel disposed to give a pre- ference to the High Operation in all cases where it can be previously ascertained that the stone ex- ceeds the bulk of a hen's egg. Should, however, the surgeon have proceeded inadvertently so far in the Lateral Operation, as either to be under the absolute necessity of breaking the stone in the bladder owing to its size; or of extracting it by undue force, and lacerating the contiguous parts ; or if the calculus be found lodged in a cyst, or adherent to the inner coat of this viscus; he would afford the patient a greater chance of surviving the operation by abandoning his project; and im- mediately have recourse to the High Operation, or what is called the operation en deux temps, where the incision is made at one time, and the stone extracted at a subsequent period, after the inflam- mation has subsided ; by this mode of proceeding the bladder would collapse, the wound in the hypogastrium heal, and the urine dribble through

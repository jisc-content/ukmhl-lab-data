What might sometimes succeed, might at other times be in- jurious ; and though we are in possession of che- mical liquids that will readily dissolve calculi when out of the bladder, yet the same menstruum when injected into the cavity of this viscus, would produce intolerable pain and inflammation. The internal coats of this organ are so irritable, that scarcely any other fluid than what it is des- tined by nature to retain (except such as are of a mild nature) can be used, without producing pain or being instantly rejected. Though we cannot expect either to cure diseases of the bladder, or completely dissolve calculi* when once formed, by these means^ yet I have frequently had re- course to the use of the vesicae lotura with ap- parent benefit. The injections I have most ge- nerally used are oil, warm ivater, solutions of opium, or belladonna in water and diluted muria- tic acid, with or without the addition of mucilage.

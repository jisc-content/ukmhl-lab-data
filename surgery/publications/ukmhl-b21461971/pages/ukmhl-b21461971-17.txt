It is not ray intention, in these preliminary re- marks, to enter minutely into the description and method of treating the morbid affections of the urinary organs in general: I purpose merely to touch on a few particular diseases more intimately connected with Lithotomy. A comprehensive knovvledge of the structure of the pelvis, and functions of its connected viscera, and the mutual relations and sympathies which each organ bears to the respective diseases to which they are liable, is indispensably necessary to direct the medical enquirer to their true source and diagnosis, as well as to the most appropriate remedies. By this mode of research, it will be ascertained that a muscular nervous structure be- longs to these parts, and that they are endowed with great sympathy ; which, when assailed by disease, excites impressions on one organ that are translated to some other remote |jart; and thus by a law of association in the animal economy, B

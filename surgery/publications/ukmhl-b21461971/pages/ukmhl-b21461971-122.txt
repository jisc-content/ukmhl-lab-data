The staff is then to be taken out, and the fore finger passed into the opening on which the forceps are conducted into the bladder, the stone taken hold of and extracted. On comparing the result of Cheseldens practice with the knife, and the present method of operat- ing with the gorget, we are led to draw this galling conclusion; that his success surpassed that of most modern lithotomists. " Let (says a modern author,) surgeons search the records of hospitals, for the operation of lithotomy since the invention of the gorget; let them recall to mind the number of cases in which the gorget had slipped betwixt the rectum and bladder; in which the incision had never reached the stone; in which the unsuccessful operator had imputed his mis- carriage to the stone being engaged in a sack;— let them recall to mind the operations of the present day, and say, if they ever heard of, or experienced success like this ?"—Allan on lithotomy.

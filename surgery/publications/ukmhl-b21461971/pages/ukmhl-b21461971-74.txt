66 fingers too rudely round the stone, by which the bladder might be injured. And this must by no means be rashly done, as too frequently it is, but with all possible prudence, for a hurt of the blad- der in that way may cause convulsions and death: first of all, let the stone be sought for at the neck of the bladder, where, if it be discovered, it is more easily turned out through the wound; for unless the stone be thus distinctly perceived by its proper marks, the operation should not be attempt- ed. But if the stone be not either at the neck of the bladder, or have receded from it, the fingers must be pushed deeper towards the bottom of the bladder, and the right hand also be carried be- hind the stone, must help to work it forwards ; and when the stone is within the gripe it must be the more cautiously and carefully handled in propor- tion as it is small and smooth ; for a small and smooth stone is apt to slip back, and to occasion much handling and teasing of the bladder.

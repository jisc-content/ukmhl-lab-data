If after a considerable interval the detention of the placenta denote a state of decomposition and putrefaction, at this period it may happen that a natural separation, or exfoliation from the uterus takes place, and the fungous mass will be discharged spontaneously and haemorr- hage follow. If, however, the substance should be loosely detained either in the uterus or any part of the passage, it ought to be brought forth without delay by means of art; at the same time cautiously extracting every portion of the membranes, and allowing the hand to remain constantly moving in the organ till its cavity be amply diminished by muscular contraction, while the remaining coagula will be propelled along with the retraction of the hand, by which means the hemorrhage will generally cease.

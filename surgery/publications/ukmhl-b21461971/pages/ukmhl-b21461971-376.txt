366 At tliis period of the operation the woman was seized with a violent labour pain, which threatened a prolapsus of the uterus and its con- tents through the abdominal wound; to prevent which, I placed both hands steadily against the propelled parts and desisted from proceeding in the operation till the uterine action ceased. An aperture was next cautiously made with the scalpel through the substance of the womb, suffi- cient to admit two fingers, and dilated with the bistoury in a similar manner and direction, with the outward wound of the integuments. The placenta was fortunately not in the way of the incision of the uterus. The nates and scrotum of the foetus presented at the artificial wound ; and Mr. Cort pressed the obtruding intestines backwards, whilst I passed the fore finger of each hand beyond the groins of the child, and extracted it by the breech as far as the neck, around which the uterus quickly con- tracted, so as to retard the delivery of the head ; I then made rather a powerful extension of the body, (with the fingers placed as before-men- tioned) which soon detached it, whereby a fine healthy male child was extracted alive. On the accession of air into the lungs it cried loudly, a's' is usual when born in the natural way; the umbilical cord being then tied and divided the child was handed to the nurse.

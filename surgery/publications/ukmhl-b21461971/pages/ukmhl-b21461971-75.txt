67 presented to the wound also. Whereas when the stone is round, there can, from the figure of the stone, be no difference in which position it is pre- sented ; but from its roughness there may; if in a rough stone there be one smooth part, let that part come foremost. Matters being thus prepared, the incision is to be made through the skin down to the neck of the bladder, of a lunated form, not tar from the anus, and with the horns of this lunated incision looking towards the hips. Then, in the deeper and narrower part of the wound, is to be made a second incision, also transverse, into the neck of the bladder itself, till the flowing out of the urine shews the incision to exceed in some degree the size of the stone. Those who, for fear of fistulas, (which the Greeks call Uriades,) make their incision too small, fall another way into the same, or greater danger; for the stone, being thrust strongly forwards into the wound, must force an opening where it does not find one sufiicientfor its exit, a thing especially dangerous when the stone is rough or of an unfavourable form, for thence arise sometimes haemorrhages, or convulsions of the nerves, which, although the patient may escape, yet the fistula must be much wider, when produced by laceration of the neck of the bladder, than by incision. The neck of the bladder being thus opened, the stone itself comes into view, which, if small, is to be got out

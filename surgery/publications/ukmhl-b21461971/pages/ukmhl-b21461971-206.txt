19G vent a (liniiiiiilion of the diameter of the uterine vessels, a degree of haemorrhage will necessarily follow, which indubitably calls for the aid of the accoucheur. If the accoucheur, immediately on the termina- tion of labour, and before having waited to ascer- tain the inadequate functions of the uterus, in- stantly begin to pull at the funis, or force his hand into that organ, and drag the placenta out hastily, he will frequently hazard the life of the mother, by inverting the uterus, or inducing ha3- morrhage by a disruption of the cord, or partial separation of the cake from the uterine surface. This mode of practice, though formerly much pursued, has, it is presumed, among rational and enlightened practitioners, for some time past been yielding to more judicious measures. The parturient condition inevitably exposes women more frequently to uterine haemorrhage than to any other incidental disease; and when the discharge is excessive, it tDccomes exceedingly alarming to the accoucheur and dangerous to the patient, in proportion to the extent to which the bond of union between the placenta and the uterine surface is affected, and the quantity of blood lost in a given time.

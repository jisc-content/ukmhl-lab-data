295 confoniiatiou incidental to the difierent diameters of the pelvis during parturition, to resolve in every exigence, how long we ought to rely on the powers of nature, and when these are deficient, to select the best means which art can suggest, in order to accomplish the delivery with becoming expedition, are essential requisites in every accou- cheur competent to exercise the obstetric art. Though in this country Pelvimeters are rarely used for gauging the pelvis, yet on an occasion of such vast importance, every means should be em- ployed to attain this point with as much accuracy as possible ; for on our decision rests both the fate of the mother and unborn foetus entrusted to our protection. To those whose opportunities of practice have not furnished them with a sufficient faculty of discrimination by the touch pervaginam, to be enabled to ascertain to a tolerable degree of exactness, the various characters and degrees of distortion to which the female pelvis becomes liable by disease, I have thought proper in this place to describe the mode of using the CaUipers,* an instrument used by Baudelocque, as being more easily applied to the patient than any other with which 1 am acquainted. * Mr. Coutouly, of Paris, invented a Pelvimeter so constructed as to be applied in the cavity of the pelvis_. a plate of wiiich may be seen in Aitkin's Midwifery.

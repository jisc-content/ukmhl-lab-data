In these cases I have more than once been able to retrace the cause to an injury inflicted on the uterine region during gestation, or from some more obscure cause. Under these afflicting cir- cumstances, every attempt to effect a disunion should be the result of great deliberation and care. To whatever extent such attachment exists, and after the accoucheur has waited the appro- priate time for the efforts of nature without pros- pect of advantage, he may commence the opera- tion by conveying one hand cautiously into the uterus, whilst the other is applied on the hypo- gastrium to stay that organ. If only a few lobes of the placenta be identified with the surface of the uterus, the extraction may generally be ac- complished by beginning at the in-edges, and peeling off the morbid adhesions from the uterus, thus gradually separating the different portions in succession, till a complete disunion be attained, and the substance of the placenta being grasped in the hand, the whole may be brought forth with- out further trouble. By this delicate mode of proceeding subsequent haemorrhage will generally be prevented; but if the mouth of the uterus should remain in a flaccid and extensible condition, it announces a more

350 for the preservation of the foetus, lliaii any other mode yet adopted ? Manual assistance sometimes becomes neces- sary, even where the capacity of the pelvis bears a favourable relation to the head of the foetus.* This may be caused by the head becoming pro- pelled into an improper axis of the pelvis ; though the expulsive efforts of the uterus, even when con- tinued for several days, would scarcely be sufficient to effectuate delivery without the aid of instru- ments. Yet in such instances, where the head has become thus permanently locked in the pas- sage, the Crotchet may be eventually requisite; when it is to be particularly observed, that the succeeding labour may terminate without instru- mental aid with perfect safety both to mother and child. Hence it appears manifestly absurd to conclude, that on all occasions where the Crotchet has been once used, a similar obstacle may ob- trude, and render the same means necessary in every subsequent instance. This circumstance un- doubtedly demands the strictest attention from the accoucheur, lest the life of the fcetus be wan- tonly sacrificed, through the indiscriminate adop- tion of a foAuer mode of operation. * This nvdl-position of the foetal head, is frequently occasioned by the iuadvortance or importunity of the accoucheur rupturing the membranes before the head has become engaged iu ihc brim of the pelvis.

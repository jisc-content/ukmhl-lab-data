121 Cases of an uncommon nature will sometimes occur, where, from necessity, the surgeon may be induced to deviate from the common plan of operating. Under such circumstances some authors have adopted the project of making an opening directly into the bladder from the vagina; by which route the forceps is conducted into that viscus, and the stone extracted. Though Gooch relates , three successful cases of this mode of operating for the stone, it has not been admitted into general practice; and it is to be observed, that by cutting through the vagina into the bladder, these parts are so situated in the pelvis, that in all pro- bability the incision will either leave a fistulous opening, or produce a cicatrix in the vagina. Should the woman afterwards become pregnant, this unyielding condition of the passage, would prove a material obstacle in delivery ; and a lace- ration of the vagina and an incontinence of urine be the result. The infi-equent occurrence of the disease in females, and the few examples on record of this mode of operating, wholly deprive us of estimating its comparative success, with that of dividing the urethra; nevertheless these successful cases, at least convince us, that wounds of the body of the bladder made through the vagina, are not incurable. This fact is established by the testimony of different authors. See Rousset^ Hildanus, Rui/sch, and Tolet,

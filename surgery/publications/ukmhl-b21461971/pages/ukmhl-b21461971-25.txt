On some occasions it may be requisite to con- tinue the practice for several weeks, particularly in cases of paralysis of the bladder, and affections of the spine from injury: in such instances it is indispensably necessary to take out the instru- ment every sixth or eighth day, to clean it from incrustations which unavoidably form about the point, and which would, if neglected, occasion much pain and irritation of the urethra on its being withdrawn in that state. Before the use of the catheter be wholly relinquished, it is always requisite to leave it out occasionally, for a given time, that the patient may ascertain if he can make water without it; for whilst the expulsive powers are inadequate to empty the bladder, its application may be still requisite. But if this precaution be wholly neglected, the bladder may lose the power of expanding and contracting, and thus its functions be irreparably lost.

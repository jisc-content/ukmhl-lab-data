Having obtained permission to inspect the body, I found on tlissection the dimensions and structure of the bones of the pelvis as follows:â€”The con- jugate, ov antero-posterior diameter, from the sym- physis pubis to the promontory of the sacrum, measured barely two inches and a half, and the antero-posterior dimensions on each side of the sacro-iliac symphysis between these two points, were in some places under, and in others a few lines more than two inches and a half, and the transverse diameter inches. The rami ischia approached so near each other, that the space left betwixt them would scarcely admit one finger in any part; and on the intro- duction of the hand into the uterus when proceed- ing to turn the foetuses, these bones receded from each other very considerably ; and the same yield- ing effect was observable in the superior strait, though in a much less degree.

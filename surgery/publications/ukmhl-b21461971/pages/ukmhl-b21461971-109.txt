101 the foetus with the forceps. If there should be much resistance from the action of the muscles of the pelvis and abdomen, the surgeon should desist from extracting, and wait a given time till the spasm be relaxed by rest, or the administering of a strong opiate; after which the stone will be more readily extracted, and less injury inflicted on the parts in its passage. The opposing obstacle to the ready extraction of the stone, will in most instances be found to arise from the wound made with the gorget being too small, which defect, the operator is sometimes compelled to rectify, by extending the incision in a lateral direction, by means of the probe-pointed bistoury. Hence the transmission of the stone with the forceps, becomes dangerous to the patient, tedious and embarrassing to the opera- tor, chiefly in proportion to its relative size and situation with the opening through which it has to pass. The stone may be either situated at the fundus of the bladder, behind the prostate and below its neck, above the pubis, screened in a cell, or ad- herent to the coats of this viscus; so that if the surgeon cannot easily seize it with the forceps, 1 would recommend the use of the /Scoop or Lever, as a useful adjunct, and one less liable to inflict injury on the surface of the bladder than the forceps.

In order to expedite the healing of the wound, made by hypogastric section, a flexible' gum catheter should be passed up the urethra, and be permanently fixed in the bladder, so that the urine may escape as it accumulates, and the receptacle remain in a state of contraction, till the wound is healed. This process will add greatly t&. the success of the operation. Instances of stones being found sacculated or adherent in the bladder are very rare, as no such eventhas occurred to me; and though we frequently hear of cases in private practice of this description, I a'm induced to believe, that the incidental em- barrassments sometimes attending the operation of lithotomy are too frequently imputed to such morbid occurrences'^* as ^ an apology for inadvert- ence, or unskilfiil pl-actice. The'presence of encysted or adherent stones in the bladder, has nevertheless been doubted by some surgical writefs.^ On thisi' subject, the * Aiiioiiir authors who embrace this opinion, are Ronsset, Collet, and Tolet. , - M

251 When the uterus manifests its natural contrac- tions, at regular intervals during labour, or subse- quent to that event, the expulsive powers are alone usually sufficient to dislodge its contents, with- out artificial assistance; but in those morbid cases, where the detention of the placenta arises from the permanent contraction of its muscular fiibres, the rational and prudential interference of art becomes necessary, after a lapse of time, ac- cording to the symptoms and circumstances of the case. In those more complicated affections result- ing from a full parturient state, and where the neck of the uterus spasmodically contracts on a small portion of the substance of the placenta, before it is allowed time to be expelled from its recess, or the funis becomes embraced by inordi- nate action, we meet with an important barrier to its natural ejection; and when haemorrhage is a prominent symptom, the accoucheur should be guided in his proceedings, by the distension of the uterus, state of the os tincee, and the fluidity, and. quantity of blood lost in a given time. In these cases, a circumspect mode of treatment, and extraction, should be promptly adopted, accord- ing to the nature and urgency of existing symp- toms, as an apparently trifling delay may some- times expose the woman to irretrievable debility or imminent danger.

The same mode of proceeding may be adopted with advantage when the breech, or any otiier part of the fcEtus presents'with the funis, provided the pulsation be perceptible in the cord. When the head of the fcctns has descended so far in the pelvis as to become permanently wedged in that tube, and either the funis or one or both arms protrude at the vulva, then every attempt to turn the child should be abandoned, and the fore-mentioned^mode of treatment, by the use of the opiates, &c. be unremittingly adopted; and eventually the uterus will unfold its orifice, and by its impelling powers, if the pelvis offer no obstruction, the presenting parts will sometimes so accommodate themselves to the figure of the different apertures of the pelvis whilst passing through it, that delivery] will take place without the use of instruments with safety. If these measures fail, then the use of the For- ceps or Lever may be admissible, and delivery will, even under these afflicting circumstances, be sometimes crowned with success; for the pre- sence of one or both arms does not preclude the use of these instruments when the extremities have been previously pushed from their situation to- wards the ischiatic notches; for on the other

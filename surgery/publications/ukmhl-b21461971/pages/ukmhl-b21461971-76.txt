m with the fingers alone, the fingers of the left hand pushing it forward from within, whilst the fingers of the right hand help to pick it out: but if it be larger, a hook, made on purpose, must be passed in behind it, the slender extremity of the hook should be flattened and bent into a semicircular form, smooth on its back part, where it presses against the parts, and rough within where it touches the stone; and it should be rather long, for a short hook has little power. " When the hook is fixed behind the stone, it must be moved from side to side, to work the stone forwards; for the stone, if it be fairly em- braced by the hook, moves along with it; whereas, if you merely press upon the stone without mov- ing it thus from side to side, it will slip, and escape again into the bladder, and the point of the hook will strike against the edges of the wound, the danger of which we have already explained. Having obtained a good hold of the stone, you are to perform, at one moment, three several motions, viz: from one side to the other and directly forwards, but all quickly; taking care first to draw the stone a Httle downwards. " Finally, the handle of the hook must be raised, that the lower end may pass deeper behind the stone, which may then be more easily extracted. The stone, if it be not easily catched from above, maybe removed by slipping in the hook at one side."

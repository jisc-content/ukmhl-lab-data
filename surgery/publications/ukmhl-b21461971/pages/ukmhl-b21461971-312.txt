302 in the course of the head throuf^li the pelvis did not take place, and the fontaneUa were pressed out of its natural direction, the labour would prove tedious, and probably might terminate in a face presentation. The Forceps and Levei- are instruments well calculated for extracting the foetus alive, within certain degrees of difficulty and deformity, and claim a preference over other mechanical inven- tions when used with judgment and caution. If the superior strait of the pelvis from the symphysis pubis to the os sacrum, or in any part from the anterior to the posterior point, exhibit a space for the reception of the head equal to three inches in diameter, we may not altogether abandon the hope of extracting a living mature child through such contracted limits with either of these instru- ments: and if the child's head be small, and the bones not too firmly ossified or connected by synneurosis membrane, to move a little over the edges of each other, while at the same time the volume of the head becomes lessened by the com- bined power of the uterus and abdominal mus- cles; in these cases, by the united aid of these natural agents, delivery may be sometimes effected, if the superior diameter of the pelvis does not in any part exceed 2| inches * On the contrary, * In a case of this description I had once the curiosity to measure the head of the child soon after birth ; its longest dia-

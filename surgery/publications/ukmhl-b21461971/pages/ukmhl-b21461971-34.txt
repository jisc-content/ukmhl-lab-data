26 They assumt^ different degrees of excitement ac- cording to the age and temperament of the patient; sometimes inciting wavering pain along the pos- terior portion of the urethra as far as the neck of the bladder, and inducing nervous and spasmodic con- tractions of the sphincter vesica; hence a degree of sympathetic uneasiness, attended with unavail- ing endeavours to micturate; aggravated by the combined action of the abdominal muscles and bladder rendering the disease still more distressing to the patient. Such derangement of the functions of the cjacu- latory ducts occasionally tends to the formation of Carunculi^ and materially opposes the passing of any instrument by the urethra with safety during a state of high inflammation and in-itation ; and in some cases where the catheter has been used, no water could be found in the bladder, and yet the propensity has still remained. In other in- stances the bladder has been distended with urine and the patient unable to void its contents, owing to the sphincter muscles, which surround the neck of the bladder and posterior part of the urethra, not acting in consent with those of the diaphragm and abdomen. For unless the expulsive and retentive powers which govern this agency, har- monize with, each other, the voluntary evacuation of the urine is wholly prevented, though the pro- pensity exists in a painful degree.

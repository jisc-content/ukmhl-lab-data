54 the stone by the percussion of the two bodies coming in contact; and a slight shock or clank is communicated to the surgeon which can scarce- ly be mistaken. Some surgeons prefer a hollow sound, suppos- ing the escape of the in-ine through the tube will bring the stone more immediately in contact with its point; but if the bladder be empty, which is frequent- ly the case during the process of sounding, the object in view is wholly defeated. Nevertheless the improved sound, as before recommended, possesses all the advantages of a hollow instrument, being nUich smaller in diameter than the canal of the iirethra from the anterior part of its bulb to the handle; and if the bladder be distended with urine, it will generally pass off gradually by the side of the sound in a way which will afford the surgeon time to explore the cavity of the organ more advantageously, than by a hollow one through which the urine escapes more rapidly. If, on the introduction of the sound, the point should be interrupted in the passage by any of the furrows or lacunce of the urethra, the surgeon should wholly (and not in part as is usually di- rected) withdraw the instrument and make a second effort, lest its point be inadvertently forced through the side of the urethra and a false passage be made ; to avoid which the fore finger may be introduced into the anus to raise or guide the point

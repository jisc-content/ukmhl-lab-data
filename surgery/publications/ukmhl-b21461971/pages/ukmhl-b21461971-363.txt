353 <legree of distortion of the pelvis, as specified in the Synoptical Tahle. Though well aware that the success of premature induction depends much on accurate tactile ad- measurement of the apertures of the pelvis, I must acknowledge that the acquisition of this indispensable recjuisite in the obstetric art, owing- to inattention and the fallibility of human judg- ment, is liable to occasional errors. To facilitate future enquiry on this subject I have tliought proper to add a Synoptical Tahle of the various degrees.of distortion incident to the female pelvis, which are likely to occur to the accoucheur in his practice. To these variations of deformity are annexed different methods of delivery, as distinctive guides for the practitioner. Still he should bear in mind the absolute impossibility of determining the mean degree of compressibihty which the cranium of the fcetus may undergo by the efforts of the uterus, exerted upon that body during labour, and also the difficulty of fixing, in a tabular form, within a fraction, every possible deviation betwixt the natural dimensions, and the greatest degree of distortion. 2 Y

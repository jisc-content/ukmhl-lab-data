359 raised by pillows, I began by making a longitu- dinal incision five inches and a half in length, as high as the navel parallel to the linea alba, and about two inches to the left of that line. The integuments and the left rectus muscle being cut through, a small opening was made through the peritoneum at the upper part; and by means of a probe-pointed bistoury, this membrane was dilated to the same extent as the external parts.* The uterus was now exposed to view and an incision of the same length was continued through it. The child presented with its breech, and was extracted through the artificial opening, but unfortunately was dead, yet did not shew any material signs of putrefaction. The placenta and membranes were then extracted with the greatest ease. The uterus was very thin, scarcely ex- ceeding that of the peritoneum, and equally so through the whole extent of the incision. No at- tempt was made to examine the pelvis from the abdominal wound. The hands of a female as- sistant were applied on each side of the abdomen, to prevent the admission of external air, and to press out any blood that might be difi'used among * It may be requisite to state, that at the commencement of the operation Mr. Hawarden was suddenly seized with a violent fit of syncope, which wholly incapacitated him firora attending to the steps of the operation, and having no other professional person present, I was obliged to be assisted by a female attendant.

This may be suf- ficiently exemplified by an inspection of the multiplicity of gorgets displayed at Savigneijs Surgeons' instrument maker, London. I acknowledge that an expert surgeon, well acquainted with anatomy, may perform this opera- tion with the gorget with safety, if the stone be small; but if its bulk equal that of a hen's egg, the wound will be obviously inadequate to admit the stone and mouth of the forceps without lace- rating the cervix visicae or w^ounding the adjacent parts. These accidents have been known to occur in the hands of surgeons of the first eminence, and on dissection after the patient's death; such disastrous events have been known to follow the use of this dangerous instrument more than any other. Some staff's are constructed with a stop at the termination of the groove, in order that the point of the gorget may not pass further into the bladder and do mischief. This contrivance will no doubt in ordinary cases answer the purpose for which it is intended; but if the bladder be collapsed and the stone fixed at its neck, I am appreheptsive that the gorget when passed on such a staff will only effect a partial division of the left portion of the .|land, and in such a position of the stone if .a B

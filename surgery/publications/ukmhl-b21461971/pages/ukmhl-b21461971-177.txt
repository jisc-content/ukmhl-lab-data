Such, for instance, are warts, corns, wens, nodes, and gailie-quercus. These varieties of diseased structure, appears too ambiguous in their nature to admit of any regular classification, and consequently can lead to no systematic method of surgical treatment, founded on such hypothesis. , - Un*? ♦•Uirin- The excrescences of plants most certainly bear a near relation to the phenomena and growth of tumours on the human body, and a minute atten- tion to the treatment of diseased structure in vege- tables, may enable the surgical enquirer to insti- tute a more rational and scientific mode of treating tumours of the human body. It is worthy of remark, that in the economy of tumours they rarely continue in an insulated state for any considerable length of time, but by ac- Y

415 hand, by either attempting* to turn the foetus or extract it by pullinoj at the arms would be useless, as there may be reason to suppose a deficiency of space in the pelvis, and if the child be dead, then, as a last expedient, the head may be open- ed, the brain evacuated, and delivery be termi- nated with the Crotchet. When one arm only presents, and the head advances in a proper direction, there appears no necessity of either attempting to reduce that ex- tremity or reversing the foetus, for this appen- dage presents only a trivial encroachment on the dimensions of a well-formed pelvis ; and if its diameters are not much below the natural standard and the head ceases to advance though the pains are strong, the Lever may be requisite, and should be applied to the opposite side on which the arm rests. But when both superior extremities advance in progression with the head, and occupy the upper entrance of the pelvis, the case wears a more formidable aspect, and this in proportion to the capacity of the pelvis and action of the uterus, and rigidity of its cervix. Nevertheless if these eventual circumstances, when taken collectively, have an auspicious appearance, we are justified in resigning the event of the case to Nature, as her efforts will be generally efficient, without hav- ing recourse to manual assistance.

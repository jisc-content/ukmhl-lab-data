161 I A CASE or TUMOUR ON THE NOSE, WITH PHYSIOLOGICAL REMARKS, - The peculiar character of this anomalous af- fection, together with some preliminary observa^ tions on the physiology of tumours in general, on the difficulty attendant on their classification, and on their affinity to certain protuberances observable on the bark and leaves of trees, may not be unacceptable to the reader. These hints may probably suggest an enquiry into the analogy which exists between the animal and vegetable kingdoms, in the production and structure of su-r perfluous parts, and be the means of instituting a more rational mode of treating such morbid affec- tions, than what at present is adopted amongst practitioners of surgery.

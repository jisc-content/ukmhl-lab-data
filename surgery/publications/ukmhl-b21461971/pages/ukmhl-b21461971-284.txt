274 that a profuse discharge of blood succeeded every pain, on requesting her to be conveyed to the bed on which I left her the day before, siie at- tempted to walk up stairs, and before she could reach the bed, a violent pain seized her, which instantly expelled the placenta, and disparted the funis about six inches from the child's navel. A great effusion of blood followed, and the wo- man fainted ere she could be laid down on the bed. In this alarming situation, and without hesitation, I determined to effect the delivery of the foetus by turning, and on- passing the hand up the vagina, I found the orijicimn uteri in a lax and dilated state, and the shoulder present- ing at the brim of the pelvis, and by conveying the hand past the projecting part of tlie foetus, I laid hold of its feet, and brought them down through the pelvis, whilst the shoulder receded backwards into the cavity of the uterus, and thus accomplished the delivery in a few minutes. The child appeared feeble, but soon recovered on being placed in a warm bath. A considerable haemorrhage followed the birth, on perceiving which, I returned my hand into the uterus, and by keeping it moving therein, for a short time, its contractions were renewed, the hand was then withdrawn, and the flooding abated, and though Jthe woman appeared much reduced by the loss of blood, she soon recovered.

By these steps the surgeon will generally be able to discover the stone, or otherwise form a more correct idea of the cause and nature of the disease. When a surgeon is called upon to perform the operation for the stone, without having previously seen the patient, he should make himself fully satisfied by passing the sound and actually feel- ing the stone himself, before he proceeds in the operation : for though the calculus may have been discovered by another practitioner, even the day before, yet this is insufficient to justify an operation. It has long been an established rule of practice, never to operate unless the stone could be dis- tinctly felt by the surgeon at the precise time of operating, and the propriety of this valuable maxim has no doubt advantageously influenced the conduct of surgeons on many occasions. This has been manifested in some instances where the stone has been evidently struck with the sound on a first trial, and has eluded every possible research on a subsequent attempt; and after the patient's death, the calculus has been found pro- truded through ihe/asciculi of the muscular fibres

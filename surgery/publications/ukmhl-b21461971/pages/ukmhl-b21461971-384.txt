574 noticed also som6 marks of inflammation spread over the greatest portion of the omentum, but more distinguishable on the inferior margin. There was no distension of any of the abdominal viscera, neither flatus nor accumulation of fÂ«ces in any of the intestines. On viewing the uterus in situ, it did not seem much larger than what is presumed usual at the same period, subsequent to delivery on ordinary occasions. The incised edges of the wound of the uterus, assumed a healthy appearance, biit were not in close contact, nor was the cavity wholly closed ; though the incision was reduced by the contractile powers of the organ to about one-third in extent to what it was before the wound was closed by the sutures, soon after extracting the placenta. In order to inspect the internal lining of the uterus, an incision was ex^ tended downwards to the cervix, the margin of the wound appeared about an inch in thickness, and exhibited throughout a uniformity of texture. The OS uteri seemed in circumference equal to a half-crown piece, or sufficient to admit the points of two fingers. There was no inflamma- tion existing either on the anterior or posterior surface of the uterus, except a few small specks, surrounding some of the punctures made with the needle by sewing up the wound at the time of the operation.

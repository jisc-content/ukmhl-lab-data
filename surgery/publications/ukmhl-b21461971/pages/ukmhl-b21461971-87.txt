79 analogical reasoning advanced by Roussct, we find no examples recorded of the high operation till about the year 1719, except a few soHtary J; instances. Tolet, in his Treatise of Lithotomy, published in the year 1683, page 76, says that " Mr. Jonnot told me that Mr. Bonnet, a chirurgeon, who heretofore practised Lithotomy in the Hotel Dieu of Paris assured him, that he had cut in that manner. " Mr. Petit, a master chirurgeoti of that hospital, told me that he had seen Mr. Bonnet practise it upon a young girl, and Dionis likewise concurs in the same opinion." Greenfield, an English sur- geon, in his Treatise on the St07ie and Gravel, published in the year 1710, at page 152 says, " I once had a patient in Long Lane, in Moor- Jields, upon whom I was obliged to perform the High Operation, and very successfully extracted the stone, by making an incision near the groin, the patient soon recovering; which shews that wounds in the fibrous parts of the bladder are not always mortal." About the beginning of the seventeenth century this important discovery as- sumed a new era in Lithotomy, and we find Douglass, Cheselden, and Proby adopted this method in England, soon after which it became practised in France by the celebrated Morand.

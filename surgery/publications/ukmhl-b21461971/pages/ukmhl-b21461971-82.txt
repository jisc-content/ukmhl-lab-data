The urethra was next divided from its bulb to the commencement of the prostate gland ; and this was usually done by reversing the edge of the knife, and finishing the incision, by dividing the canal of the urethra upwards in a direction to- wards the pubis of the patient. The urethra being thus laid open, the surgeon was to take hold of the staff with one hand, and with the other to push a male conductor along its groove into the bladder; the staff being then withdrawn, a female grooved conductor was guided along the other into its cavity.

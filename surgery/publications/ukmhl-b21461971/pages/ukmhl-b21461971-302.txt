292 to be conducted to the brim, where the admeasure- ment may be generally ascertained, to the space of a few lines, by alternately placing- them dia- gonally in the superior strait in the following manner: ' I. —If when the hand* is conveved through the vagina to the brim of the pelvis extended, and the fingers kept close together, the side of the fore-finger touch the os pubis, and that of the little one, the projecting angle of the sacrum ; the distance will be about three inches. II. —If on moving the little finger out of the way, and placing the other three conjunctively, in the same diagonal direction as before directed, and their sides come in contact with the pubis and promontory of the sacrum ; we may conclude that the space betwixt these two opposing points, is little more than 2 inches, an opening through which no mature foetus can possibly be extracted alive, nor even if we suppose the space to be 2^ inches. III. —When only two fingers can be placed edgewise in the foie-mentioned manner, and be- twixt the two angles of the short aperture of the pelvis, the extent will not exceed 1^ inches. * A tolerable sized hand methodically directed up the vagina, will readily pass through the apertures of a pelvis, the small diameter of which docs not exceed 2£ inches from the pubis to the sacrum, even if the lateral dimensions are contracted.

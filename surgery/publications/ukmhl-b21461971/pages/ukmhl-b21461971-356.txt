346 female pelvis (except in cases of Malacostenn, or under some very peculiar circumstances) acquire little or no augmentation during the process of labo*ur, therefore our hopes must rest chiefly on uterine action combined with the degree of com- pressibility in the fcetal cranium; and this is so variable that scarcely two fcetal heads will be found to yield with the same facility to an equal degree of expulsive uterine power when passing through the pelvic passage. Yet this body will sometimes become modelled in a wonderful man- ner to the winding apertures of the pelvis; and in some instances of distortion, I have observed after birth an evident depression of a portion of the cranium and denudation of the integuments which had been caused by the projecting angle of distortion, opposed against the head of the fcetus during labour : but such injury alone, except m very long and tedious labours, will seldom become dangerous. Nature has imparted to the bones of the cranium such flexibility, that they will sus- tain considerable pressure without any palpable marks of injury either to the cranium or the functions of the brain. Perhaps this important to be applied to the pubis, to relax the symphysis of those bones .vith the view ol-affording the child a free passage by their giving xvaydnring labour.-Vide Chap. 10, Opuscul. and Physiolog. and Auatom. lib 2.

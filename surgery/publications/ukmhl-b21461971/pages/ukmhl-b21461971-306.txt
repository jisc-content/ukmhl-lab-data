296 " To determine how much the superior strait is defective in the diameters, and measure it by means of the compasses, we take the thickness of the woman from the middle of the mons veneris to the centre of the depression of the base of tlie sacrum posteriorly, by applying one of the points of the instrument before, againsl the symphysis of the pubis; and the other behind, a little under the spine of the last lumbar vertebra: and deduct three inches from that thickness in women that are thin, for the base of the sacrum, and the anterior extremity of the ossa pubis ; the thickness of these latter being at most but six lines, and that of the base of the sacrum two inches and a half; and so constantly so, that I have not found a differ- ence of a line in about five and thirty pelves, dis- torted and contracted in all manner of ways, and in all possible degrees. This subtraction of three inches from the external thickness of the pelvis, in the said directions, is also sufficient when the lustiness is moderate; and ^ye may add one or two lines more, when it is excessive, because the fat which forms the mons veneris, easily shrinks under the lenticular extremity of the compasses. The result of this procedure is so exact, that the pelvis measured with the common compasses after opening the body, was not above a line over or under my estimation in any one of my experi- ments. A greater precision, if we could obtain

347 organ is comparatively less affected by injury during parturition, or in early infancy, and before it has acquired the faculty of associating the dif- ferent impressions of sensation, than at a more advanced period of existence ; nevertheless, if the scale of disparity between the diameter of the pelvis and the head ogf the foetus be very consi- derable, so that the existing disproportion at any parturient period of gestation amount to f of an inch, it is highly probable that not only a depres- sion of the cranium of the foetus may take place, but a detachment of the pericranium and dura mater ; hence internal extravasation and conse- quent derangement of structure will ensue, and the vital functions of the brain be either greatly impaired or wholly destroyed : particularly if either the Forceps or Lever have been used to facilitate the birth. I am much mistaken if I have not, in many instances, been able to trace to this source some lamentable instances of de- ranged intellect and hydrocephalic affections in children thus barbarously used during delivery.

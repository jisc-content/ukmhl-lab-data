116 The stone may be extracted from women either by the high, or the lateral operation; but the lateral method being comparatively easy, when contrasted with that in men, it is usually preferred. It may be performed in various ways ; but the most usual method consists, in passing through the meatus urinarius into the bladder a grooved director or staff, nearly straight; the grooved side is turned obliquely downwards and outwards, in a direction almost parallel with the ramus of the left OS ischium. The operator then holds the staff firm in his left hand, whilst he conveys the beak of the cutting gorget into the sulcus of the staff, and makes the necessary incision by gently pushing it along, till it has entered the cavity of the bladder. The stone is then to be extracted either by the fingers of the surgeon, or by means of the forceps; some surgeons make use of a con- ductor, on which the forceps are conveyed into the bladder. The records of surgery, furnish us with instances of stones of an enormous size being either na- turally voided, or artificially extracted from the urethra, by means of dilatation of the meatus urinarius. Such, for example, is the case related by Borelli, (cent. % obs. 22.) of a stone coming spontaneously from a female, the size of a goose's egg. Kirkringius and Bartholin have each de- scribed one as large as a hen's egg.

On the other hand, where gestation is completed and these means fail in suppressing the flooding, or preventing mcreased tension of the abdomen, and the uterine action recurs at regular intervals, and the woman exhibits symptoms of multiplied danger; we may first rupture the membranes and if the haemorrhage be not soon suppressed, it may be prudent to proceed to deliver by cautiously insinuating the fingers successively through ihe os uteri by the side of this viscus, till the whole hand has gained admittance. The feet of the foetus may be seized by the hand, the body turned, and delivery effected in the usual way.

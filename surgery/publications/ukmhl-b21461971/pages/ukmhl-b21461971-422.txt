412 l-emark is peculiarly applicable to the present en-' quiry. The analogy which exists between the natural and preteratural presentations in quadrupeds and bipeds may tend to illustrate this observation; the most frequent presentation in the former species of animals is with the two fore feet preceding or accompanying the head. Now taking into con- sideration the similarity of anatomical structure in the conformation of the bones of the brute and human pelvis, there is reason to believe that this parturient process is effected with equal fa- cility in each species* I know from observation that delivery will take place in quadrupeds with- out manual assistance, whether or not the fore^ feet of the young advance along with the head, for their being absent renders this position to be classed by authors (on animal parturition,) among preternatural presentations. If the accoucheur has the whole management of a case from the precise time of the discharge of the liquor amnii, and the hand and head of the foetus are found by a common examination to pre- sent together, the pelvis being well-formed and the uterus dilated, the recession of the hand may be frequently accomplished by raising it up dur- ing the absence of uterine action, and supporting it at the brim of the pelvis on the extremity of the fore and middle fingers, conducting it posteriorly

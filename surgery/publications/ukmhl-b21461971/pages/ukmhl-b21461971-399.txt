Authors have detailed a great variety of causes to account for preternatural presentations of the foetus. Such, for instance, as distortions of the pelvis; peculiarity in the figure of the uterus, and the manner of the ovum passing into it; the superabundance of the liquor amuii, and the precipitate way in which it is discharged from the bag; the irregularity of nature in implanting the funis into the abdomen of the foetus ; frights, and sudden shocks of the body. As the proximate cause of the adverse presentations of the child appear to be involved in much mystery, and we have no controul over these mechanical and adventitious events, little advantage can accrue to the accoucheur from any conjectural reasoning on the subject. Notwithstanding which, a more correct knowledge relative to the charac- teristic functions of the uterus has been acquired by modern physiologists, and consequently a more rational arid effective mode of conducting the parturient process been adopted. In all mal-positions of the foetus, the difficulty of turning is augmented more or less in proportion to the action of the uterus, the extent of its orifice,

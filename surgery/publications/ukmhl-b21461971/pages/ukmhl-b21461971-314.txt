i 301 what degree of compressibility is the mature fatal cranium capable of fcustainiug without destruction, during its passage through a pelvis of given di- mensions, and what is the proportion of difliculty in this case compared witii the delivery of a pre- mature foetus of seven months? This question is not easily solved, owing to our inability to deter- mine the bulk of every foetal head, and the di- mensions of the cavityof every individual pelvis, as well as the power of uterine action during laWur. We may have a general idea of the fiffure and extent of the child's head, both before and after birth ; but as no two heads nor pelvises are found in either state uniformly alike, the dif- ficulty of forming a previous judgment becomes unavoidably increased. The solidity of the foetal head, and the reaction of the bones of the pelvis upon that body, are so variable in different children and in different stages of labour, that no exact criterion can be formed before birth. However, I will venture to hazard an opinion that the component parts of the mature foetal head when exposed to the risks attendant on 9iatural parturition, will bear a reduction in size by pressure during its evolution through the pelvis, from I to 1^ an inch without proving fatal; but when the volume of the head becomes diminished beyond this, either by the use of the Forceps or J^ever, or other mechanical power, their appUca-

2()5 fectious, such as liyclati(ls * Polypus,'! Moles, Tyujpaiiites, spongy Tubercles, Scirrhus and Can- cer: but genuine sarcoma:l;of the body of the woiiib is not so frequent an occurrence as in the neck, or cervix, and such disease more conniionly in- vades this part of the viscus in advanced life, about the period of the final cessation of the menses than at an earlier period. This may perhaps depend on the cervix uteri being more glandular than other parts of the organ. Goagula of blood or fungous excrescences formed in the vagina,: or uterus have been frequently distinguished by the terra mole, or polypus, and have in some instances acquired such a degree of firmness and apparent vascularity, that, when implanted in the uterine cavity, they have so far distended its parietes as to exhibit the appearance of a state of gestation. * A case of hydatids io a woman three iiionths advanced in pregnancy, occurred to nie some years ago. The foetus appeared in a shriveled state, arid the placenta le^s vascular than usual, alid th^ quantity of hydatids expelfed'amounted to more than a gallon. These pellucid hydatids bore a great afhnity in structure, size, and general appearance to the vesicular congeries of frog spawn produced during the spiring season. t See M. Herhiniaux's Traile sur les Polypes de la Malrice, and also Levret on the same subject. X I have attended a case of sarcoma of the uterus, as large as ijie head of an adult. 2l

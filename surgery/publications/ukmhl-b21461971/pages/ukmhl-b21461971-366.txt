356 of the head of the thigh bone, on tlie left side. This produced a shortening of the limb, and of course a limping. Soon after her recovery from this injury she became pregnant, and on Friday, November 22iid, 1793, she was seized with labour pains, being then at the full period of utero-gestation. Tlie midwife who attended her in her former labours was sent for on this occasion, but having Avaited with her several .days, without the least prospect of delivery, she thought it advisable to have more assistance, especially as the waters were discharged on the second day of the labour, and no part of the child could be ascertained to present within reach. On Tuesday the 26th, 1 was desired to meet Mr. Hawarden of Wigan, ^ upon a consultation on this case, but arriving a little before him, I examined the parts per vaginam, and was extremely surprised to find that I could barely pass my finger between the ossa pubis and the last lumbar vertebra, so great was the narrowness at the brim. Besides this, the outlet was so much contracted that it was with some difficulty I could introduce three fingers at that part. After asking some questions, I was informed of the accident. This information induced me to repeat my examination with more exactness, in order the better to ascertain the precise dimensions.

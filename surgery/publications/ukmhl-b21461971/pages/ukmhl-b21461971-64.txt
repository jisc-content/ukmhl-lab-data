Prior to sounding this viscus the surgeon should inform himself of its shape, size, structure and connection with the relative situation and alteration of its bulk from a state of repletion to collapsion, and likewise the extent of expansion of the peritoneum, as a wound of this membrane would permit the urine to pass into the abdominal cavity and expose the sufferer to great danger.

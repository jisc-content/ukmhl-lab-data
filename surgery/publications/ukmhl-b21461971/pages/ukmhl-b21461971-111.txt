103 wards extracted by compounding the lateral with the anterior mode of operation above the pubis. Cases sometimes occur, where the advanced age of the patient, or certain organic diseases or peculiarity of circumstances, wholly debar the propriety of attempting the operation in any form. On such occasions palliative means have been attended with advantage; and Dr. Douglas,* re- commends making an artificial opening into the urethra through the perineum, by which aperture the patient may introduce a probe, and push back the stone to relieve the paroxysms and suppression of urine. In a project of this kind, and where the calculus is indentitied to be small, the artificial opening might probably be dilated, so as to allow the stone to be extracted either in the way recom- mended, by distending the meatus urinarius on women, or by means of Mr. Arnott's dilator. See also the Medico Chirugical Transactions, vol. xi. page 349, where there is an account of a case in which numerous calculi were extracted from the urinary bladder, without the employment of cut- ting instruments, by Sir Astley Cooper. It has been the practice of some ancient lithoto- mists in cases where the stone was either very large, * Phil. Trans. 1727, vol. 35, page 318.

188 the concavity of the sacrum more extensive, the symphysis pubis is wider in the female, and the angle of the arch more obtuse, consequently the OS coccygis is at a greater distance from these points, and the space greater. This invariable peculiarity of formation in the female pelvis, ap- pears admirably adapted by the author of nature for the more easy reception and egress of the foetus during the process of parturition. If not designed for this wise purpose, whence arises the' sexual difference in this respect ^iui v^ '(Thus labour is evidently facilitated and not retarded by the adaptations of Providence. Daily observation likewise evinces the peculiar and appropriate proportions which exist through- out the quadruped creation, between the capacity of the male and female pelvises, and the respec- tive size of the foetal head; and sufficiently prove by analogy the intentions of the Deity in this particular instance, in assigning a free exit for the foetus at the time of birth; iow si^dw 8ft Among the pre-eminent and concurrent circum- stances in human parturition, is the number of sutures and flexible bones, which form the cranium of the foetus, compared with those of the adult, together with the favourable presentation of the head of the foetus almost invariably corresponding with the longest diameters of the pelvis, as it >vinds through the cavity at birth.

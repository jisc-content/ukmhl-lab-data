The substance of the gland is apt to become inflamed from various causes, which may proceed to the formation of an abscess, and terminate in sup- puration of one or more of its lobes. Occasionally a deposit of puss is also formed in small sacks or follicles; and this species of diseased pros- tate usually produces retention of urine, by pressing on the sides of the urethra, and dimi- nishing its diameter. Sometimes an abscess will form in the vicinity of the gland, and either burst into the bladder during the introduction of the catheter, or the puss be discharged through the instrument, aud pass off spontaneously. In either case it may be prudent to allow a flexible catheter to remain in the passage for a few days, to aid the further evacuation of the contents of this viscus so long as the discharge appears purulent; or until the gland subsides to its natural and healthy state, or the wound is healed, to prevent the urine getting diffused in the pouch of the abscess, and thus irritating the surface of the sore, and preventing its healing. In some more rare instances, a portion of the posterior, or middle lobe of the gland becomes enlarged, pro- jects into the bladder, and hermetically closes the opening of the urethra, so that the point

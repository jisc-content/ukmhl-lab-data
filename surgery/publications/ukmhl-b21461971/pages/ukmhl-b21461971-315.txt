2 Q tiou becomes proportionately daiig;erous both to the child and mother. If the bulk of the head be reduced hi its di- mensions further than the extent above mentioned, by one ofthepam^aZ bones passing over the other, and tlie pericranium and dura mater become de- tached, vi'hile pressure on the brain is continued for an undue time, a degree of plethora and in- ternal extravasation will take place on that deli- cate organ, and death ensue either during labour or soon after it. Yet, under these precarious cir- cumstances, the natural spheroidal figure of the fcEtal head may sometimes by pressure be changed into another more favourable form, and pass with impunity through a pelvis, the conjugate diameter of which at the brim, does not exceed 2f inches, if the mother be strong and the uterine action powerful. Hence will appear the impropriety of using the Crotchet without great circumspection, on the presumption that the child cannot be other- wise born alive. In some peculiar forms of distortion, where the projectiiiig-angle of the sacrum is , contorted in a lateral direction, there is a greater space left on the contrary side. In this diverse structure of the pelvis, and where the most favourable part of the head of the fcetus rests at the widest part of the aperture, I am induced to believe that the Lever has a decided preference over the Forceps; for 1

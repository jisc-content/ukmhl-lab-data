Yet the discharge will be repressed, and in this way profuse uterine haemorrhage may be restrain- ed ; and in cases of great exhaustion, during the formation of coagiila in the ends of the bleeding vessels, immediate danger be frequently averted. Hence uterine haemorrhage subsequent to the middle period of gestation and parturition, in whatever degree it presents itself, or however insidious its nature may be, requires from the accoucheur the most unremitting attention. It may be venous, as well as arterial, so that the application of the plug, assisted with the bandage and pressure on the abdominal region, with the view of promoting coagulation of the effused fluid, appears an eligible and probable means of afford- ing relief. It frequently gives time for the vvo- man to recover from the state of apparent exhaus- tion, to which she has been by depletion exposed, 2 H

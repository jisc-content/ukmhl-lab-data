Upon the whole, therefore, we should avoid a too precipitate use of instruments on the one hand, and exposing the mother or child, or both, to imminent danger, by waiting too long on the other; all these circumstances must be maturely considered and compared with each other, such as the nature and power of the uterine pains, the length of time the woman has been in labour, the symptoms which may arise, the advances the head has made, the nature of the presentation, the form of the pelvis, the state of the soft parts, &c.

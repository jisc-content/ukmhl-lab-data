14 no stricture in the urethra, is attended witli ev^ dent advantage. On other occasions the gland may he invaded with an irrei^ular swelling, and greatly increase the prostatic curve of the urethra, thus distorting the passage so as to cause peniia- nent retention of urine. I have attended many cases of this description, and have sometimes succeeded in employing a catheter less curved than ordinary ; on otiier occasions, one more bent has seemed to pass into the bladder with greater freedom when assisted with the finger in tlie rectum ; but in cases so complicated, and where the passage is become much diminished and contorted by disease, this is mere chance, and the surgeon is left to grope his way, as it.were, in the dark in the best manner he can. An indolent and less sensible enlargement of the gland some- times occurs, distinguishable from phlegmonous inflammation, which is notunfrequently combined with a scrophulous diathesis, and which does not altogether produce constitutional irritation further than what is excited by occasioiial interruptions of the flow of urine. This may be relieved by a judicious introduction of the catheter; and if much difliculty be experienced, rather than having it to pass as often as the patient has occasion to evacuate his urine, lie may retain it in the bladder for a given time ; during which the urine may be evacuated ad libitum, either wlioUy or in part.

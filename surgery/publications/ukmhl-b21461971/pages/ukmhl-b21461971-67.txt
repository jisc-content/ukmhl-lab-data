When the surgeon is employed in sounding the bladder in cases where the discovery of the stone is difficult; he should place the patient in different positions, and use every possible means with great diligence to reach the stone at the first attempt; as there is often a degree of reluctancy in the patient submitting to a second examination. When sounding a patient for the stone under some indurated conditions of the bladder, the surgeon should not only make very accurate search, but be scrupulously cautious in deciding on the presence of a stone in this viscus, lest the * Sometimes the surgeon when passing the catheter or sound may encounter a calculus in the posterior part of the urethra ; in which case he should not attempt to push it back iuto the bladder, but whilst the instrument is in the passage, he may pass the fore finger up the rectum, and by pressure on the prostatic and membranous parts of the urethra endeavour to press it forwards; then by placing the finger on the perineum behind the stone as the catheter is withdrawn, the calculus will follow. If these expedients fail, an incision may be made on the stone, and it may be extracted through the opening.

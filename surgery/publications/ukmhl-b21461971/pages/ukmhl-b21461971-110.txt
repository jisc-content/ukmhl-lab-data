102 By this simple instrutiient, when employed in complex cases, the stone will in genertil be more readily found, and extracted with greater facility, and without the risk of its breaking; an accident which should always be avoided if possible, for, however well the bladder may be washed out with injections, there is always danger of fragments remaining, which may serve as nuclei for the future formation of stones. Cases occasionally occur where the stone is too large to pass between the converging tuberosities of the ischii; in such instances, surgeons have sometimes succeeded in breaking the stone, and different instruments have been invented for the purpose. But a number of. cases are recorded by authors, where the stone could neither be broken in the bladder, nor extracted by the incision in the perineum. The case of Sir AÂ¥alter Ogilvie, as related by Sir James Earle in the Philosophical Transactions, is one among many others of this description. Nevertheless, if the surgeon will avail himself of his knowledge of the size of the stone, by means of the finger passed up the rectum prior to the operation, he will not be brought into this dilemma, but select the high operation in pre- ference to the lateral method; as instances have occurred where the surgeon has been foiled in this stage of lithotomy, and the stone has been after-

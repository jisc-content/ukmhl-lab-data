378 pose. Mr. Barlow readily yielded to my solici- tation, and accompanied me to the patient's house about twelve o^clock the same evening, when we found her in a state of delirium ; after waiting for some time she became sensible and more composed. " Mr. Barlow now made the necessary exami- nation per vaginam, and remarked that the pelvis was more distorted by a state of 3Ialacosteon than ^ on her preceding labour, on which occasion he had been compelled to deliver with the Crotchet. Â« On consulting together on the propriety and mode of delivery most proper to be adopted, it was our united opinion that the possibility of effecting this purpose with the Crotchet was doubt- ful, and if attempted she might expire under the operation, and as there was reason to believe the child to be alive, we concluded the Caesarean section to be the most justifiable mode of pro- ceeding. Our sentiments were humediately communi- cated to the woman and her friends, who ex- pressed a wish to have the aid of Dr. Chew on the occasion; a messenger was immediately dis- patched, and in a short time he arrived, and on having made a minute investigation of the state of the pelvis and condition of the woman, he coincided in our decision on the propriety of the operation, and she without hesitation submitted to our proposal.

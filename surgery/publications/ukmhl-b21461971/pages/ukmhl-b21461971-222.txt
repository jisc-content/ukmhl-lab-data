2i2 is an essential point lor the accoucheur to keep in view, and not unfrequently liolds out a cheering prospect, even when danger appears approaching. When no flooding or other urgent symptoms occur, and the uterus assumes a state of perma- nent torpor, we may with safety withhold these manual means, and wait even two or more hours before attempting extraction by artificial efforts,* * Mr. Turnbull, in his history of a case of Extra Uterine Gestation, Page 22, says, " I have not, as yet experienced any mischief from allowing the placenta to remain in uterine cases; but I have often been a witness to much injury being done, in precipitating its expulsion by rash introduction of the hand, for the purpose of tearing and extracting this substance from the ex. tremely tender and irritable interior surface of the uterus.

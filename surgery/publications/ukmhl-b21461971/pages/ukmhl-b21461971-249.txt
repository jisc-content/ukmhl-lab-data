But at this premature period of gestation, unless ha;morrhage or convulsions occur, we need not be over-solicitous about the deliverance of the placenta. I would rather leave it to be expelled by the efforts of nature, which will generally be effected with perfect safety in less than twenty-four hours after the birth of the child. When there is a partial detachment of these two organs, accompanied with flooding, spasm, and rigidity of the os tincae sufficient to preclude the admission of the hand with safety under these adverse circumstances, it has been the practice of some authors to extract the pla- centa by means of instruments constructed for that purpose; but this dangerous and unnecessary expedient is now exploded.* If the patient should appear much exhausted by a continued emission of blood from the uterus, I would, in the first place, earnestly recommend palliative measures, such as injecting a full stream of cold water into the vagina, the application of a solution of ice or nitre in cold water, put into a bladder and laid on the region of the uterus and pubis, together with the use of such medi- cines as have been already mentioned. * See BurtGu's System of Midwifery, and Levret's V Art des Accouchmens.

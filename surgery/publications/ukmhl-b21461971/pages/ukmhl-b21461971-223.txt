213 during which interval the accoucheur should occasionally ascertain the state of the os uteri, lest internal haemorrhage, or a contraction of the cervix takes place. Gentle frictions may be used with advantage on the hypogastric region, and mild cordials cautiously administered into the stomach, to excite the vital functions, and pro- mote the extrusion of the placenta. Should the uterus shew no disposition to con- tract, on the extraction or natural expulsion of the placenta, and syncope and hemorrhage ensue, the accoucheur should immediately pass his hand into the uterine cavity, \vhere it may be moved about until its contractile functions are restored, after which the hand may be gradually withdrawn, together with any remaining portion of coagula or loose fiUaments of the chorion or amnion, tioners advocating the propriety of leaving the expulsion of the placenta wholly to nature. Nevertheless we are informed, that on two or more occasions the placenta was retained after birth for the space of one or two weeks, and was afterwards expelled in a state of putrefaction, and the women died the same day. And in other instances it remained adherent with comparative impunity for more than twenty-four hours. On a dispassionate and retrospective view of the subject, these deplorable incidents ultimately determined Dr. Hunter to adopt a contrary course of practice during the remainder of his life; since which period the mode of submitting the exclusion of the placenta wholly to the agency of nature has been greatly modified.

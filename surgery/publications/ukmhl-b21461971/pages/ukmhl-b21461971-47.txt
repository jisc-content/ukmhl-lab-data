39 aloiiff tliis sensible membrane, the extent of sur- face on which it acts, unavoidably excites the connecting muscles into inordinate action, which the will of the patient is unable to control. By the same law of excitement in any part of the system, inflammation, swelling-, and distention are produced. Thus it is easy to explain how inflammation of the mucous coat of the urethra tends to diminish the diameter of the canal, and cause retention of urine. The levator ani ; compressor prostatas and accelerator urincB, so effectually embrace the canal of the urethra, that when this sensible internal membrane is influenced by the undue action of these muscles, and is either irritated by the passing of an instrument, or from any other cause, the diameter of the urethra is proportion- ably diminished. The canal of the urethra presents different degrees of diameter at several points in its healthy state, and its" lining also possesses great vascu- larity and sensibility of texture ; but the irritation of this delicate membrane, is in some degree mitigated by the bland mucus excreted from the follicles of the different glands of the urethra, which lubricates the passage, defends it from the acrimony of the urine, and considerably facilitates the introduction of any instrument along the passage*

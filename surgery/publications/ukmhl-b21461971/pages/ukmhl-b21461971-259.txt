249 of dissection. In a treatise on this subject by Or. Engletnan, there is a case of a woman who soon after delivery, lay for upwards of a quarter of an hour apparently dead. A maid servant anxious for the recovery of her mistress, applied her mouth to her's, and blew with all her force, and in a little time the woman revived. The reader can scarcely help being struck with the coincidence of this method of resuscitation with that adopted by Elisha, in the case of the Shu- nammite's son, as recorded in the ?nd Book of Kings, chap, iv, verses 34 and 35. Without recapitulating the various remedies which have been pointed out by writers, as ap- plicable to cases where the vital principle* has been suspended, or attempting to establish a cri- terion of death,f under such complicated affec- * Galvanism, in my opinion, ranks among the most promising agents for reanimation. t It is a melancholy reflection to read of instances where per- sons have apparently died suddenly, and been prematurely com- mitted to their graves; such facts, however, may be found in the works of different authors.

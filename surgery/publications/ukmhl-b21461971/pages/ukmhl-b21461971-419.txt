This last un- pleasant accident, I ani led to believe, is some- times incurred by the officious application of counter-pressureiindul5^ exerted by the accoucheur to the framum laUdrnm, against the part where the greatest presisurte is made by the head of the foetus, as it diverges under the arch of the pubis. In a AVell formed pislvis the arch of the female pubis is somewhat larger than that of the male, designed, no doubt, for an easier passage of the head of the child during parturition. But in a de- formed pelvis, the ossa ischia generally approx^ imate each other in a more acute angle, and expose the perineum to'laceration by not allow- ing the vertex to occupy the arch of the pubis at birth. To prevent which, the accoucheur should apply pressure with the points of his fingers against the vertex of the fcetal head, as it emerges under the arch of the pubis during every labour-pain, and thus oppose its advancement for a given time, till the soft parts havfe' become re- laxed and ■ distended sufficiently for' the' labour ■ 'to terminate with safety.

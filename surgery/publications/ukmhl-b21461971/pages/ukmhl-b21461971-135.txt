127 is to make the incision from its commencement in the integuments below the scrotum to its ter- mination below the anus, and through the inter- vening muscles, prostate gland, and neck of the bladder, to an extent proportioned to the size of the patient, and sufficiently to admit the forceps, and extraction of the stone without bruising or lacerating the contiguous parts. But this cannot be effected unless the whole of the incision be made more extensively than what most modern operators are in the habit of doing, and hence I am per- suaded, results the disparity of success. An ample division of the parts concerned in the operation always facilitates the extraction of the stone, discharge of urine, or blood, from the wound, prevents subsequent inflammation, and greatly expedites the patient's recovery. On comparing the cutting part of most gorgets now in use, with the extent of the prostate gland, from its apex to the base, where it surrounds the cervix vesicae, it will be evident that such con- struction is inadequate to effect a complete section of this organ even in its natural state; but when enlarged by disease, as it frequently is in calculous affections, such defect is still more manifest and the danger resulting is proportionably greater. Under such circumstances is it possible without incurring danger to the patient to extract a stone from the bladder, the dimensions of which, together with

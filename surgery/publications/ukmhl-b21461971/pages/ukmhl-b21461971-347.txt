It must be allowed that a living mature fcetus Jiiay occasionally be born, where the conjugate <lian]eter of the brim of the pelvis does not reach 3 inches. To corroborate this fact, I am confi- dent that in several cases the lives both of mother and child have been preserved by means either of the Lever or Forceps within this given space. On one woman I employed this mode of deli- very by the Lever with success, in seven succeeding births, where the Crotchet had been used by other practitioners three or four times in preceding cases. Yet it is to be acknowledged that like all other rules there are occasional exceptions to the pro- priety of its adoption, owing to the varying struc- ture and capacity of the pelvis, the flexibility of the cranium, and the expulsive power of the uterus, I am nevertheless inclined to believe, that the majority of mature children will perish either during labour or soon after birth, when the antero- posterior diameter of the superior aperture of the pelvis is not more than 3 inches. Much how- ever will depend on uterine action, and the reduc- tion of the bulk of ihe foetal head. I have before remarked, that the size of the , head of a male child is generally greater, and more compact than that of the female; and in cases where the pelvis is contracted only a very few lines, this trifling variation, when combined with 2 u

310 want of accuracy in discriminating- between tlir relative size of the foetal liead, and the dimensions of the apertures of the pelvis, through which it must necessarily pass; and on the otlier to the various contingent events unavoidably linked with malformed pelvis and uterine passivity. I have thus pointed out with as much precision as I am able, the minimum or intermediate diameter of i* of an inch as the most warrantable space allotted for the success of this species of operation, when performed about the end of the seventh month of gestation ; before or after which period it appears from these data, an unjustifiable pro- cedure, and not likely to be attended with success to the foetus. When this operation is determined on, and the dimensions of the pelvis are such as promise success, we ought to select the time for its com- j)letion with the utmost care, in order that the child may derive every possible advantage for acquiring an uninterrupted birth, for the nearer the recurrence of the operation to the period de- creed by nature, and the greater will be the pro- spect of a successful issue. It is evident that premature delivery, like many other operations, requires a suitable time to be selected for per- forming it. (Viz.) When the short diameter measures from 2^ to 2| inches.

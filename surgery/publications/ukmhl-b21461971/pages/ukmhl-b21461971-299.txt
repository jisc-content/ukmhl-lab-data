To become sufficiently acquainted with the fun- damental principles of midwifery, and to ascer- tain the exact dimensions of the various apertures of the pelvis, is a matter of the greatest moment to the accoucheur, before he determines on any artificial mode of delivery. The want of the ncr cessary knowledge acquired by the touch, may unwarily involve the practitioner in irretrievable mischief, when the extent of the deformity of the pelvis does not in reality warrant the application of instruments. The distortions of the female pelvis are gene- rally induced by Rachitis,* in the infantile state, or by Malacosteon and Exostosis in the adult, and sometimes fracture or dislocation of the bones of the pelvis, occasioned by accident, may produce an effect equally afflicting or unfortunate in its nature. * It is asserted by Dr. Osborn, that Rachitis or Mollilies Ossium, is a disease " to which quadrupeds under no circum- stances, are ever subject." On this account I may be allowed to differ in opinion from this author, for I have known many young pointer dogs afflicted with this disease chiefly in their legs, in consequence of being starved, when on having been indulged with warmth and better food, they have acquired a degree of strength equal to others of the same species, though their legs were visibly bowed afterwards, and their speed much impaired. 2o

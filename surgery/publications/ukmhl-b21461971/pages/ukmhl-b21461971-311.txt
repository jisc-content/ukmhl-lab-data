301 of the crauiuni, and the degree of resistance op- posed by the pelvis, and the irregular action and power of the uterus during its passage through that cavity. Without enumerating the various positions which the foetal head assumes on the approach of labour, it may be necessary to state, that the general and most natural presentation, is the vertex nearly in the axis of the pelvis, with the ears rather in a diagonal direction between the pubis and sacrum, and the occiput inclined towards one ilium, and the face towards the other. The cause of this part of the head descending first into the brim of the pelvis, may be owing in some measure to the foramen magnum being situ- ated nearer the occiput than the face, conse- quently is more mechanically inclined to be first pushed into the superior aperture of the basin, by the action of the uterus on the commencement of labour ; sometimes, however, the anterior fon- tanella may, on the approach of parturition, be perceived by the touch to present in the axis of the superior strait; but this trifling deviation is generally rectified by the repeated efforts of the uterus, which force the vertex into the centre of the cavity, whilst the chin becomes reclined upon the breast, and the face turned into the hollow of the sacrum, and thus the natural process of par- turition is accelerated. If this fortunate curve

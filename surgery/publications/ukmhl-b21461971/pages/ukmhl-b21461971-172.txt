Whoever surveys the structure and functions of the animal and vegetable creation, will find a much greater and nearer resemblance than at first would appear to be the case; for if we look at the stamina of plants, they will be found to con- sist, of fine capillary tubes, which run parallel with each other, and the bark of trees is double, like the skin of animals. On viewing the interior parts, there will be found distributed the paren- chymous, resembling the fibrous, and in the centre the pith or medullary substance, as also air vessels, lymphatics and lacteals. On a retrospective view of the great difficulty of exactly ascertaining the respective boundaries which appear to separate the animal fi'om the vegetable kingdom, and considering the unifor- mity of the structure and functions of the relative orgajis destined for nourishment and growth, from their infant state to the period of old age and decay, it will appear evident from such research, that both these departments of natuce are influ- enced by similar laws ; and that the Deity, in the exercise of his agency, has been governed by the same model in each system.

rently humiliating- still there exists an analogy in respect to growth, so that the occasional excre- scences of trees, and the preternatural tumours sometimes formed on the human body are pro- duced and generated by a vital action in both cases similar. When a plant, for instance, is wounded by some external cause, there takÂ«e place a copious ex- udation of lymph from the wounded part ; and if the injury be not mortal, granulations shoot out from the surrounding vessels, the part becomes healed, and a cicatrix is formed, similar to what takes place in the bodies of animals. Little as these crude remarks may appear to possess, either of novelty or interest, yet if we take a glance at the organization of the lower order of the living system of nature, and compare the simple with the more complicated and exalted animals, we shall invariably find the wants of the former more limited and supplied with greater facility than the latter. It will appear useless in this place to enter into an enquiry respecting the functions and economy of organized beings in general; suffice it to say, that all the varied actions of the animal and vege- table creation may be referable to some physical law\ Hence it follows, that there is no apparent distinction between the natural and unnatural

For if the internal effusion be so trivial that no distention of the abdominal parietes be perceptible to the touch, nor the discharge outwardly so copious as to produce any obvious effects on the system, the loosened part of the mass mav be allowed to remain for a time in the passage with impunity, audits presence may tend to tlie formation of coagnla, or com])ress the apertures of the blood vessels which open into the uterine cavity, and thereby diminish the impetus of the discharge till a more favourable opportunity offer for extracting the remaining adherent j)or- tion bv art, or the uterus resume its action and disburden herself by the efforts of nature.

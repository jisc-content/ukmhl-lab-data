15 The instrument, however, should be taken out occasionally and cleaned ; and if the urine is not discharged naturally by the action of the bladder during this interval, it may be replaced for a cer- tain period. This mode of distending the passage and allowing the parts time to regain their ordi- nary functions, may be advantageously adopted in many cases of morbid retention of urine, arising from inflammation, irritation, or indurated strufcture of the prostate gland. Another and no less perplexing cause of retention of urine, proceeds from active inflammation of the prostate gland, extending up the urethra, the tender vessels of which become so surcharged with blood, that on every gentle attempt to introduce the catheter, the eyes of the instrument get so com- pletely blocked Up before it enters the bladder, that no urine can pass through the tube. In this case the gland is usually of a spongy texture, and the blood often recedes into the cavity of the bladder, and from its gravity naturally occupies the lowest part, whilst the urine remains above. To obviate any obstruciibn ill the catheter, 1 usually plug up the eyes of the instrument with wax before 4ts''introduction, and when the point ha.^ reached the fundus vesica, I withdraw the stillct, and if the wax does not dissolve by the heat of the part in due tito'e, I then place my mouth io the open end, and by blowing forcibly

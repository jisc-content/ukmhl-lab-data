In some inslaiices a person will scarcely bear tlie loss of a small })ortion of blood, without iiicm'riug danger, while another under apparently similar circumstances will lose many pounds with comparative impu- nity ; and in some plethoric habits, where the circulating system has been much accelerated by tedious labour, there is frequently a considerable flux of blood immediately succeeding the birth of the child, and before the uterus has had time to contract, and eject the placenta; which dis- charge, if neither profuse nor incessant in a full state of body, may be attended with advantage to the patient, by unloading the turgid vessels of the uterus, and preventing subsequent fever, &c. If, however, the woman be debilitated by active haimorrhage without intermission to an alarming extent, exhibiting the usual symptoms of danger, we must in this case proceed to ex- tract the placenta without delay, as a trifling loss of blood when uninterrupted, may eventually prove fatal in a robust as well as in a delicate constitution. We cannot always draw a certain prognosis from the cause of the hajmorrhage, nor judge the instrutnent, by which process the temperature of the uterus and vagina are reduced below their ordinary standard, and the distended bladder pressing on the extremities of the bleeding vessels of that organ, ihc lutnionhagc uii.y be further restrained.

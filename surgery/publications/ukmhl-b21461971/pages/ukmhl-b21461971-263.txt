In this situation it should be kept moving for the space of ten or fifteen minutes, or till the spasm of the cervix uteri be overcome. The stimulating motion of the hand will, in some de- gree, expedite the operation; if the adhesion should be complete, the disunion is much fa- cilitated by a gentle pressure made with the other hand upon the hypogastric region, to steady the uterus.* The separation of the placenta from the upper part, must be first gradually and cautiously attempted by insinuating the ends of the fingers betwixt the membranes and uterus, and sliding the hand from side to side; a dis- union will thus be produced, as though it were done by a cutting instrument, through the whole extent of the attachment; and the cake, if pos- sible, should be preserved entire and brought to the cervix uteri, where it may be allowed to re- main till the cooperating efforts of the fundus assist in propelling it forwards; by which action, the whole placenta will be excluded, and the operator's hand may then be withdrawn along * This proceeding is indispensably necessary on all occasions which require the hand to be passed into the uterus, whether in cases of adherent placenta, or in preternatural presentations of the fuel us when employed in tinning.

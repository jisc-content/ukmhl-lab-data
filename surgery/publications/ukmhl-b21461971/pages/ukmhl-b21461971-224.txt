In these perplexed cases, attended with syncope and depression of the vital energy, it requires much discrimination and judgment to determine the precise time, and to what extent the administering of cordials may be requisite ; for it is to be feared that they are often used indis- criminately and to an injurious degree, both externally as well as internally. Opium given in very large doses has been re- commended on high authority as being almost a specific in uterine haemorrhage, but an implicit reliance on its efficacy does not, from my expe- rience, warrant such conclusion ; it is nevertheless a valuable adjunct in many affections of the uterus, particularly in convulsions and irregular spasmo- dic contractions of its muscular fibres; but in cases of syncope, connected with flooding, if in- tended to produce a sedative effect on the system, it may so far retard arterial action as wholly to suspend the vital functions and expose the patient to imminent danger. It is the peculiar lot of some females to be

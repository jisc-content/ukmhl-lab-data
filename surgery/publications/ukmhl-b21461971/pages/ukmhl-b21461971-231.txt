It will nevertheless be always necessary to bear in mind the equivocal nature of uterine he- morrhage, as every discharge of blood from the uterus is not an invariable and sufficient justifica- tion for the immediate extraction of the placenta. Sometimes a passive discharge of blood or vent of coagula will at intervals take place, in which case, it becomes necessary to keep in view the strength of the patient, and the quantity and quality of the evacuation,* before manual as- * In a few instances of profuse haemorrhage from the uterus, I have adopted the use of cold water injected into its cavity with advantage, by means of an apparatus similarly constructed to the one described by Jesse Foot, in his cases of the practice of Vesicae Lotura, with the addition of a bladder fixed to the end of the flexible tube or catheter, which may be conveyed in a collapsed and empty state into the uterus, where it is to be retained as a receptacle for the cold water when forced from Ihe elastic gum bottle previously adapted to the otijer end of the catheter. This mode of suppressing hairaorrhage, by the application of cold to tiie intenial superfice of the uterus, may be repeated as often as deemed necessary, by alternately evacuating and re- newin" the contents of the bladder, and without withdrawing

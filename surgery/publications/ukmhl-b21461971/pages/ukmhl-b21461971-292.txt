282 <liinensions, positions, and relative proportions wliicli the inotlier's pelvis and tlie cranium of the child, bear to each other. It seldom hap- pens indeed, that the size of the fcetal head is so exactly adapted to the capacity of the pelvis, as to require no force to squeeze it along ; but although the head should be a little too large for the passage, yet the sutures suffering the bones to lap over each other, the head there- by lengthens, so as to be forced through the space by the pains, unless the pelvis happen to be very much distorted, or the bones of the cranium unusually ossified. But supposing these circumstances to occur, let us see what will be the consequence of a large head in the event of labour. In the first place, it will require longer time, and greater efforts to force it through the upper part of the pelvis; but by means of the sutures crossing each other, its bulk will be so diminished, that at length it will be forced down to the middle of the cavity of the pelvis. Here the space becoming again somewhat more contracted, the head will be re- tarded and cannot advance till such time as it is further lengthened, after which, however, if the pains are strong, it will be gradually pressed down to the lower part of the aperture, and be protruded through the os externum. The over- laying of the bones of the cranium, is a fortunate

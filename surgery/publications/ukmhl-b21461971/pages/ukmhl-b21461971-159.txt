From this period, the wound assumed a granu- lating and healthy appearance, and the urine was voided voluntarily through the urethra in increased quantity; in the space often weeks, from the time of the operation, the wound was completely healed, and the man retnrned home in a state of apparent good health, being able to retain his urine in considerable quantity, and propel it at pleasure. On a minute examination of the state of the prostate gland at this period, by the finger in ano, its size appeared very much diminished from what it was prior to the operation.* This man lived many years after the operation, during which period he enjoyed a tolerable state of health though the pre-disposition to the formation of stone still existed in the system ; for he informed me that he had passed two small calculi by the urethra, and his urine was mixed with sabulous matter. * It is very probable, that if the gorget had been used in this case, it would not have divided more than half of the left portion of the prostate gland, consequently the incision must have been quite inadequate for the free extraction of the stone, and pro- bably too small to admit the blades of the forceps without miicli violence; and owing to the indurated structure of the gland opposing sucli a degree of resistance to its introduction into the bladder, it is very Hkely that, during the attempt to accohiplish this step of the operation, the prostate gland must have been severed from its connection with the membranous portion of the urethra, and the posterior part of the bladder become iransiixcd.

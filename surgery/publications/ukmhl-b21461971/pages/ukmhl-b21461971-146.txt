It may generally be secured by means of the needle and ligature after the stone has been extracted; but if this expedient fail, compression must be applied by inserting into the wound a canulafrom three to five inches in length, adapted to the size of the patient, and depth of UiP, wound; with a piece of dried sponge slightly tied round it so as to allow it to swell by imbibing moisture: thus serving to compress the divided ends of the vessel under the edge of the os ischii, while the tube may answer as a vehicle for the free discharge of the urine or blood which may have accumulated in the cavity of the bladder. The transversalis perinei is always divided in the operation, be- cause its course is directly across the perineum, and cannot escape the knife, and immediately on its division blood is profusely discharged ; but if the surgeon will pause a few seconds, the artery will retract among the cellular substance, and the haemorrhage cease spontaneously. Sometimes the arteries about the prostate gland are aug- mented by disease, and when divided the blood is apt to make its way into the bladder: this spe- cies of hsemorrhage is only discovered some hours after the operation by the patient appearmg rest-

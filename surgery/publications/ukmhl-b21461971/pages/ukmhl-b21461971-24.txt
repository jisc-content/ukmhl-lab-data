To prevent unnecessary irritation of the parts, by having recourse to the use of the catheter as often as the patient has a call to micturate, having once succeeded in its introduction, I generally prefer leaving it in the bladder; as the urinary organs are easily excited to inflammation by fre- quently passing the instrument. In most cases of diseased prostate gland, or affections of the bladder, accompanied with re- tention of urine, I have long been in the habit of retaining the flexible pewter catheter in the bladder, by first "passing the instrument in the usual way, and then introducing a finger up the rectum, pushing it upwards so that the concave part near the point will hook behind the os pubis, and remain permanently fixed ; I then plug up the open end of the catheter with a piece of cork, which may be taken out and replaced when the patient has a call to evacuate his urine. In cases where the coats of the bladder have ap- peared in a state of great irritation, or inflamma- tion, I have tied a small bladder to the open end of the catheter to receive the fluid as it dribbles

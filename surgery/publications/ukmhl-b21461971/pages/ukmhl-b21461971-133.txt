125 stone without lacerating or bruising the passage. This method of operating I have adopted on females, and it appears so manifestly simple, that it wholly supersedes the use of the sound, grooved staff, and gorget, and is less liable to expose the patient either to incontinence of urine, or fistulous opening of the vagina, than by the common mode of operating with the gorget. The vesico-vaginal fistulas and incontinence of urine incident to females subsequent to the use of the gorget in this operation, are always distressing to the patient, and troublesome to the surgeon. This is sufficient to inspire a dread of its use ; and the attempts made by the faculty to obviate so disastrous an occurrence, have in a great measure failed of effecting so desirable an end. The late Mr. Hey recommends a cylindrical piece of linen formed into a tent and introduced up the vagina, with a view of supporting the incised edges of the wound during the progress of the cure. With the same intention recourse may be had to the introduction of a canula fixed in the passage, made of elastic gum, and resem- bling in shape a clyster pipe, but somewhat thicker (if used on an adult.)

It greatly facilitates the dis-

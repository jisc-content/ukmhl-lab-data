123 to happen than after the urethra has been distended beyond its muscular power by artificial means. On reflection, it will appear evident that by making an effectual opening into the bladder, in a lateral direction with the gorget for the easy trans- mission of a large stone, there will be some risk of either cutting deep into the vagina, or dividmg the pudic artery on the left side ; in the first in- stance, an incontinence of urine will follow, and in the latter, the patient will be exposed to danger from hemorrhage ; to obviate these disastrous events, the use of a gorget constructed with a double cutting edge, by which the canal of the urethra may be equally divided transversely on both sides, will form a greater opening for the exit of the stone, leave the vagina untouched, and the pudical vessels exempt from injury. It is in reference to these parts, that the success attending the lateral operation on women chiefly consists : and it must be confessed, that there is al- ways difficulty in avoiding them when we are com- pelled to make an incision to a certain extent, sufficient for the admission of a large stone with facility and safety.

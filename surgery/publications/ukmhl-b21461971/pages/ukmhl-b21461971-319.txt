309 place, to state the circinnscribed dimensions of the apertures of the pelvis, wherein it is most likely to meet with success. Under these incidental constructions of female deformity, I presume that a pelvis, the small di- ameter of which measures from pubis to sacrum, about 2^ or 2| inches, appears to favour the utility of this mode of delivery more than any other given dimensions. For on the one hand it is sufficiently evident, that where the pelvis measures 2| inches, the Forceps or Lever may be advantageously used; but a mature foetus cannot be born alive, when the extent of space is under 2^ inches, in which case the Crotchet becomes necessary ; and should the superior aperture measure only 1^ inch in the widest part of its conjugate diameter, the only resource for the safety of the mother and fcetus, is the CcBsarean Operation; and, in this high degree of difference, premature delivery can avail nothing towards preserving the life of the fcetus. See Synoptical Table. If it be proved that this operation cannot be performed with safety to the child, except where there is a space existing in some part of the su- perior aperture, adequate to what has already been stated, then it will follow that this mode of delivery must be very much limited, insomuch that a considerable degree of hazard to the foetus will always attend it, owing on the one hand to a Â»

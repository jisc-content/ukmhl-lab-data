The extent of uterine haemorrhage in abortive cases, is not always commensurate with the stage of gestation, but is dependant on a combi- nation of contingent and constitutional causes peculiar to the sex; and particularly imputable to the imperfection of the connecting media be- tween the placenta and uterus. . Hence our endeavours to control any profuse discharge, should be chiefly directed to abate the general circulation of the system, excite the con- tractions of the uterus, and diminish the ex- tent of surface formed by the disunion of the placenta from its site of the uterus, and the dia- meter of the blood vessels which enter the cavity of that viscus.

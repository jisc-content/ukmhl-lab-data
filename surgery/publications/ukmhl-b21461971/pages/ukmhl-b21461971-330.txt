320 excite additional ardour in the practitioner, to rescue these puny beings from an untimely grave. In the Second Book of Esdras, chap, 6. ver. 21, there is a pointed allusion to the present subject, "The women with child shall bring forth untimely children, of three or four months old ; and they shall live and be raised up." Avicenna, an Arabian Physician, declares he has seen lively children born and reared in the sixth month. Hieron 3Iantuus, says he knew a Butler of Ki7fO' Henry's of France, that was born in the fifth month, who when he wrote was alive and of a good age. See Lib 4, chap. 41. Hieronymus Cardanus asserts, that he knew an instance of one Clara of eighteen years of age, who was born on the one hundred and forty eighth day from the time of conception. See Lib I. Afpho7ius Ca- ranza cites several authors who allow that children may be born alive and survive as early as the sixth month, such authors for instance are Johan JJro- deus. Jacobus Segarro\ Henricus Salmulhus, IJo- ratius Augenius, and Claudius Geardimis. Â¥ide chap. 9. Alphonsus de Sancta Cruce gives his testimony to successful births under six months. We have an instance recorded of a foetus living at the early period of five months. See Brouzet Essai sur 1" Education Medica, Page 37 & Seq.

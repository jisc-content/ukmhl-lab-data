From one mastoid process to the other, along the base, is about two inches; from chin to cheek is three inches."

This difference of sex cannot be known before the child is born, and the dispro- portion being trifling, could not influence the pro- ceedings of the accoucheur, were he previously acquainted with the fact. The next question which presents itself, is in what degree of distortion of the pelvis it becomes expedient to have recourse to this operation ? This point will not be easily ascertained with mathematical precision, unless the accoucheur be allowed to make an examination j^er vaginam; and as this delicate step is not altogether attain- able during the earlier months of gestation, and before the propriety of premature induction has been determined on, it becomes requisite in this

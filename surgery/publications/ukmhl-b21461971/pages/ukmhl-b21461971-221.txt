211 litems will be better able to effect the extractiou through the axis of the brim, cavity, or outlet of the pelvis, than when employed in a contrary direction. When the separation and detrusion of the pla- centa do not yield to these simple cautious means, and the secondary pains fail to recur at the usual period, and the os uteri is contracted, it is better to desist from further attempts for a given time, lest a partial detachment should take place, and an unhitermitted hemorrhage ensue, which might urse as to introduce the hand into the uterus, when otherwise there would have been no necessity for such interference. This degree of depletion might reduce the patient to a state of langour before the placenta could with propriety be ex- tracted ; so that should she survive for a period, it is more than probable a state of debility would supervene, and dropsy take place, either soon after or posterior to the usual term of gestation. We ought, therefore, to proceed with the utmost deliberation and caution, and not to hasten the removal of the placenta, unless led to such ef- forts by a profuse or insidious haemorrhage be- fore the usual tokens of uterine action be mani- fested, which propitious event will generally, in due time, realize our expectations, and crown our future proceedings with success. The active state of the uterus in these cases,

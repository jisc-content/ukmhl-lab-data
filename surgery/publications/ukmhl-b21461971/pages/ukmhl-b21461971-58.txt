On other Occasions when certain lithontriptic fluids have been injected into the bladder, the pain excited and the injury inflicted on that organ, have been so great as to deter modern surgeons from attempting to dissolve urinary calculi by this process. Still it is to be regretted, that we are yet ig- norant of a specific chemical agent adequate to dissolve a stone in the living bladder when too large to pass naturally by the urethra; and till this arcanum has been discovered, lithotomy will ever remain an indispensable expedient. It would be foreign to my present design, to enumerate the various preposterous medicines which have at different periods been administered to abate the distressing symptoms of this disease,

38 The whole canal of the urethra, even when exempt from disease, appears to possess a degree of contractile power, which prevents the invo- luntary issuing of the urine, and also slightly im- pedes the advancement of any instrument up the passage. In these circumstances, when the pros- tate gland is diseased, and inflammation has spread over the whole member of the urethra, whether produced by stone or other morbid affec- tions, the patient experiences a more than usual desire to micturate; and thus the reiterated exci- tation of the sphincter muscles of the perineum, and adjacent parts, presents an obvious barrier to the introduction either of the sound, staff, cathe- ter, or bougie. The urethra being designed for conveying the urine from the bladder, is surrounded by a vas- cular cellular texture, named Corpus Spongiosum, and lined internally with an exceedingly delicate rugose membrane, endowed wdth great sensibility and some elasticity. The posterior, or prostatic portion of the urethra and neck of the bladder, is also encircled by a particular fasciculus of muscular fibrers, and is subject to great sympa- thetic irritation and contraction. This is exem- plified by a* variety of instances, both in health and disease; for in the latter case, when the ' urethra is in a; state of inflammation or irritation, on attempting to pass a common sound, or bougie

275 Cases of twins, with the intervention of se- veral days between the births of the children, are recorded by most writers on midwifery; but a simihir interval happening betwixt the delivery of the two placentas, subsequent to the foetuses, is a more uncommon occnrrence. Such a case I met with some years ago. The woman had been de- livered, during my absence, of two fine healthy children. On my return the next day, I found her restless and labouring under much pain, and slight haemorrhage at intervals; I prescribed an aperient mixture, which produced three evacua- tions from the bowels, and at bed time a draught containing 30 drops of Tinct. opij. On the following day, I called again, and per- ceiving her much in the same state as on the preceding, I was induced to lay my hand on the abdomen, which appeared uniformly distended as higli as the umbilical region, and rather tender on the application of pressure. These symptoms led me to suspect the uterus was distended with coagulated blood, and I gained permission to pass the hand up the va- gina ; and to my surprise, found the orificium uteri wholly occupied with a j}lacejita, which I readily extracted, and a large gush of offensive coagula immediately followed. Soon after this event the woman expressed herself as being much relieved by the change.â€”

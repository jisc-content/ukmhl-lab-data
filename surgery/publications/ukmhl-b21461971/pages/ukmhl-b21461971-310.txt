300 riods my observations coincide chiefly witii those of Burns. See on this subject Mauricean, Schu- rigius, Kerkringius, Ruysch, Riolanus, Burton, Hmiter, Johnson and many others. Abstinence and depletion of the system have been proposed as a means of retarding the growth of the foetus in utero, with a view of rendering labour less difficult where the pelvis is faulty, but unless this project be scrupulously enjoined by the mother during the whole time of pregnancy, there is reason to believe that its effects would be wholly abortive, and might in certain conditions of the constitution do harm if carried to this extent; nor is it in the power of the accoucheur to discriminate in which cases such forbearance might be advan- tageously pursued, even if it was found efficacious: for in the lowest orders of society where women subsist invariably on a spare diet, we find their offspring in no respect reduced below the ordinary size of those females who live in a state of uninterrupted affluence; therefore this scheme appears too uncertain in its effects to be relied on as an expedient in cases where the diameters of the female pelvis are much abridged. The walls of the pelvis are firmly connected together, and the change which the foetal head is constantly undergoing as gestation advances, always presents an obstacle to the safety of pre- mature delivery, owing to the uncertain magnitude

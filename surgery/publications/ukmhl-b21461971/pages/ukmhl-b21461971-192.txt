]82 iriliabitaiits of dillereiit nations who dwell in the torrid andyhV*V/zones, and niost unpoHshed parts of the globe where luxul-y has found no abode, we are informed it is not very uncommon to ob- serve labour terminate with little or no appearance of pain, or indication of sorrow on the counte- nance; and in such uncivilized states of society -HifJ- ■ . ■■ as they are delivered. Dr. Bancroft says " that child bearing is attended with so Httle pain in Guinea, that tlie women seem to be exempted from the curse inflicted upon Eve." See also an interesting account of the customs of the North Amrrica Indians in Dr. Rush's Medical Inquiries, Vol. I. " during pregnancy (he remarks) the women are exempted from the more laborious parts of their duty: hence miscarriages rarely happen among them. Nature is their only midwife, their labours are short and accompanied with little pain, each woman is delivered in a private cabin, without so much as one of her own sex to attend her, after washing herself in cold water she returns in a few days to her usual employment ; so that she knows nothing of those accidents which proceed from the carelessness or ill management ofMidwives; or those weaknesses which arise from a month's confinement in a warm room." The London Practice of Mid- wifery contains a case of a woman being delivered in her sleep. See also Baynard on Cold Bathing, Page 173, and Brooks's Natural History, Vol. I, Page 175. It may appear strange, (though true) that it is at the present time, the custom among many nations of North America, for the husband to betake himself to bed the moment that his wife is delivered. T'lis ridiculous custom is now practised in the Can- ton of Bern, and is called /aire couvade. Mark Paul observed this among the Tartars, and Herodotus, also found it practised among the Scylliiaus.

These different morbid affections and degrees of distortions incident to the female pelvis, the accoucheur should keep in view, when making the admeasurement per vaginam by the touch, or with the callipers. Under such a variety of distortions to which the pelvis is subject, it is no easy matter for the ])ractitioner to ascertain on all occasions, whether the defect be so great as to preclude the possi- bility of the head of the fcetus from passing through its apertures with impunity. Impressed with a sense of this difficulty, accoucheurs have exercised their ingenuity, and invented different

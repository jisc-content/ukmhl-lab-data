feec. 37, Forestus de morbid Malierum, lib. 28, 2(5R iion on the region of tlie uterus, and the use of detergent injections thrown up the vagina, or fconveyed into the.cavity of tlie uterus itself, have been recommended for tlie purpose of exciting the propulsion of its contents, and of rendering the application of ligatures more manageable. If these indications fail, obstetrical writers have had 'recourse to a variety of uncouth instruments, the construction and management of which appears equally incommodious and dangerous, whether exercised on the os uteri, with intent to dilate its orifice, or employed in abstracting the ex- uberant contents of the womb. Some of these antiquated inventions, 1 am happy to say, are now discarded, and modern authors have substituted instruments much better adapted for the purpose. Those chiefly used on these occasions by the an- cients were. Forceps, Ligatures, Hooks, Probes, Pinchers, Dioptra, Sj)eculum Matricis, Gryphon's Talon, &c. For a sight of such inventions, and <in account of their respective uses and modes of application, the reader is referred to the works of Celsus, Paulug, Scultetus, Avicenna, Hilda- nus, Roonhiiys, Levret, Sigusmunda, Pare, Mau- riceau, Dionis, Heister, Astruc, Clarke on Fe- male Diseases, Bibliotheca Anatomica, Medica Chirurgica, Vol. 3d, Bonetus Sepulcret. lib. 3,

When the pelvis measures barely 2f inches id the superior strait, it would be extremely hazard- ous to attempt to turn the foetus, and in most cases utterly impossible to accomplish delivery without lessening the volume of the head by evacuating the brain; and should the small diameter of the Superior aperture rfeach 3 inches, the head of a mature foetus may under certain favourable con- ditions of structure and position, occasionally be- come moulded to the passage, and pass uninjured either by the efforts of nature or manual assistance. Still I am disposed to conclude, that were a just estimate to be formed of the fatality atten- dant on the foetus, in this last stated degree of distortion of the pelvis, the balance w^ould pre- ponderate on the destructive scale, even under the most skilful management. Granting this inference to be just, does it not api)ear that premature delivery offers a more fa- vourable resource, when the superior aperture of the pelvis measures from pubis to sacrum, or m any other of its diameters, between 2J to 2| inches,

Little or no information is extant of the pro- o-ressive state of midwifery, from the time of Hippocrates to that of Celsus,* a cotemporary of the Emperors Augustus and Tiberius., This I author, however, (though probably not am ac- i, coucheur,) claims the merit of being the first who t directed the introduction of the hand into the uterus with the viiew of extracting a retained pla- centa; but at what precise time, or on .what . particular occasion, this method of practice was ^ founded, we are at a loss to conjecture ; neverthe-* less, it is evident, from the subsequent records of the obstetric ai't, that very opposite methods of, conducting the operation, were countenanced by different writers, ia most parts of the civilized globe, for the space of several centuries.

Soon after his arrival, I introduced a flexible metallic catheter into the bladder, fitted with a small cork to plug lip the end: the fore finger being passed up the rectum, served to bend the apex of the instrument behind the ach of the pubis, where it was per- manently fixed, so that he could remove the cork, and evacuate his urine, ad libitum. The use of the finger in the rectum, whilst passing the instrument, afforded me an oppor- tunity of ascertaining the morbid indurated state of the prostate gland, which was greatly en- larged, and in a very rigid condition* Not- * Tlie symptoms of stone in ll)e bladder, and a morbid con- dition of the prostate gland being in some respects similar, it is liighly necessary that the surgeon should invariably pass the finger up the rectum prior to the operation, and if the gland be enlarged, it will be discovered by this means with miich facility. By such timely investigation, the surgeon will bie governed in the various stages of the operation, and be enabled to form a pretty accurate idea of the determinate extent of the incision of the neck of the bladder and necessary distension of the blade of the bistouri cach^, prior to its introduction into the organ, pro- vided the surgeon uses this instrument.

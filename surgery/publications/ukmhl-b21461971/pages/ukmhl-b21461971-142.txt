131 ON THE USE OF THE BEAKED LITHOTOMY KNIFE OR BISTOURY, AS REPRESENTED IN Plate I. Fig 2. Perceiving such a degree of prejudice to prevail among surgeons of the first eminence in favour of the gorget, and being myself fully con- vinced of its imperfections, I have invented a substitute which appears to combine in itself all the advantages of the Gorget, Knife, and prohe pointed Bistoury without their imperfections. When used as a gorget the surgeon will per- ceive its cutting edge to be so far elevated above the groove of the staff, that it makes its way through the prostatic part of the urethra into the bladder with greater facility and less danger to the patient than either the common gorget or bistoury; and on withdrawing it in a horizontal direction the section of the prostate gland and neck of the bladder may be extended to whatever space it may be judged requisite. I have operated with this instrument several times both on young and old subjects with perfect ease and success; and, from its simplicity and manner of dividing the necessary parts, I have little doubt but upon an impartial trial, it will be found hereafter to supercede every other instru- ment yet brought to notice.

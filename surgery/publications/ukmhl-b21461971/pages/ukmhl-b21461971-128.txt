120 bladder; the pipe is then drawn forwards with the stone concealed tliereiii, and extracted. The various projects adopted by authors, of mechanically dilating the urethra for the purpose of removing calculi from the urethra or bladder may no doubt be practised with safety within certain limits, where the circumference of the ex- isting stone and the diameter of the canal of the urethra bear no great disparity to each other; but in cases where the size of the stone far ex- ceeds the capacity of the urethra, the method of dilatation has sometimes proved insufferably pain- ful and tedious and an irreparable incontinence of urine has been the consequence. Douglas nearly a century ago recommended the extraction of small stones by dilating the urethra, but if the stone be known to be large, he proposes in preference the High Operation. Morand seems to embrace the same opinion for he says, " as for the woman, I believe, that if the stone be small, the common method is preferable to the high operation ; but, if large, the apparatus altus is better than the ordinary method, because of the incontinency of urine, which happens through the laceration, and extravagant dilatation of the sphincter caused by the passage of a large stone."

This important branch of surgery began to be cultivated with unexampled ardour during the early part of the seventeenth century, and fur- nishes interesting lessons of instruction to the surgical enquirer. The lateral operation, as promulgated by Frere Jaques, appears to be the natural result of suc- cessive improvements made by many ingenious lithotomists, among whom may be ranked Morand, in France, Raiv, in Holland, and Cheselden, in England. Subsequent to this epoch, Morand, a member of the Royal Academy of Surgery at Paris, reasons very dispassionately on the different methods of lithotomy, as practise<l in his time, and says, that " all of them may be used with propriety, as the circumstances of the patient require." He con- siders a variety of methods an advantage, rather than the contrary, and would refect no plan of operating which had reason and experience to* justify it. o

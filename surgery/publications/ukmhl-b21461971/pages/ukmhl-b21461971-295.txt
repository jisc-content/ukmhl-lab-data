285 cannot be delivered with safety. And it ought to be remembered, that by waiting in this manner we gain a double advantage; first, from the lengthening of the foetal head, and next from its being forced low down into the pelvis, so as to render its extraction by instruments more safe and easy. In cases where the pelvis is consider- ably distorted, the head of the foetus, if not too firmly ossified, will generally be lengthened more than in any other instances, and sometimes the labour will terminate unexpectedly by the efforts of nature; in other cases, though apparently similar, the head may be firmly ossified and get locked in the pelvis, (if the diameters are equally contracted,) insomuch that it can neither be forced down by the pains, nor be extracted by instru- ments, without first evacuating the brain and diminishing the volume of the cranium. Since, therefore, the advantages of waiting are so very great, and since nature often does the business when we should have least expected it, we ought not to have recourse to the use of in- struments, till from the circumstances of the case we are fully convinced that they are absolutely required. It is a nice point to determine on these occa- sions how long we ought to withhold our assist- ance ; if we are in too great haste to deliver, and the mother or child should suffer injury in con-

On consultinsr the works of different writers on midwifery, there is a considerable difference in their respective statements of the mean dimensions of the heads of children at the time of birth; and on comparing the measurements 1 have taken, I find that they accord the nearest with the state- ment given by Burns. "The longest diameter (says this author) of the head is from the vertex to the chin, and this is near five inches. From the root of the nose to the vertex, and from the chin to the central portion of the sagital suture, measures four niches. From the one parietal pro- tuberance to the other, in a transWrse line, mea-

which the head l)ecomes impelled against the angles of the superior aperture of the pelvis, and acts like a wedge in forcing the passage open, while in affections of Exostosis no such change is produced. Eight cases of this species of progressive de- formity have fallen under my notice; in one of which the projection of the last lumber vertebra, at its union with the angle of the sacrum was so much bent forwards into the cavity of the pelvis, that on the introduction of the fore-finger up the vagina, a protuberance was presented to the touch very much resembling the head of the foetus, pretty far advanced into its cavity.* On carrying the finger a little higher anteriorly past the pro- jection, 1 could with some difficulty ascertain the head of the child ; but on moving it around, the distortion appeared so great, that the whole circumference did not exceed that of a half crowu piece. This occurrence was on the 29th of April, 1792, at which time I delivered the woman with the Crotchet, and the bones of the pelvis receded considerably to the impulsive efforts, during the * This protuberance had been mistaken for the presenting part of the child's head by the attending practitioner, who had previously to my being called in, been in attendance' two days and nights, and had determined on perforating the head with tUc .scissars before my arrival at the patient's house. 2t

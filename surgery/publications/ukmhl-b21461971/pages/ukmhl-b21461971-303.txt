293 From this last limited extent the accouclieur may feel assured that when the period of gestation is completed, except a greater distance can be obtained, in either of the lateral diameters of the superior aperture, no other mode of deli- very is so eligible for the safety of the mother, as either the Crotchet or CsBsarean section. If the accoucheur be not primarily acquainted Avith the measurement of his hand, and fingers when placed in conjunction with each other, he may after having explored the different apertures of the pelvis, apply his hand to a graduated scale, and he will thereby be enabled to supply the de- ficiency. In some peculiar conformations of the pelvis, it happens that where the projection of the sacrum is by disease or accident, contorted in- wardly and laterally, that the opposite aperture offers a larger space for the reception of the foetal head than what is the case in a natural state; and when using the fingers as a pelvimeter it is indis- pensably necessary to attend to this circumstance, as a knowledge of snch irregular conformation may govern our future plan of conduct. If igno- rant of this, by such an avenue left for the entrance of the foetal head, delivery will in some instances be terminated with safety to the child without manual assistance; and in others if the Lever or Forceps be necessary, when used with caution, the lives of both may be preserved.

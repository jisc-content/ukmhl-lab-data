210 funis, aiul partial disuiiited surface of the retainecl mass from the uterus. On all occasions where the introduction of the hand mto the uterus is re- quired, it is necessary that the contents of the bladder and rectum be previously emptied ; and though I believe it contrary to general prac- tice, it is more eligible either when extract- ing the placenta, or turning the foetus in utero, to introduce the hand in such a way that the palm be directed towards the pubis and abdomen of the woman. On whatever side the woman be laid, by this means the hand is with greater facility conducted to the feet of the foetus or placenta, particularly in women with pendulous bellies where the uterus is pushed out of the axis of the apertures of the pelvis. The hand of the accoucheur thus conducted into the efFected without using great violence and exposing the woman to imminent and unnecessary danger ; and supposing it to be ac- complished in this way, the placenta will have to be disparted in the uterus and afterwards extracted, and great risk incurred of a second inversion, which presents a material objection to this mode of^'proceeding. The more rational and less injurious method appears to be in all cases, whether the placenta be at- tached to the uterus, or otherwise, to compress the whole sub- stance between the hands like a sponge, by which the blood will escape, and the uterus be diminished in size ; and the placenta, if adherent at the same time, will be separated, so that its re- duction mav be safely and readily accomplished without further interference by the method above adopted.

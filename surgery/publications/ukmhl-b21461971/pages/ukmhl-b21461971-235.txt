225 a temporary suspension of hemorrhage occurs, we are not in this situation to look at the bright side of the case, but steadily apply whatever remedies we may think proper, and watch every change of symptom with unwearied attention, foregoing all other interested views and engage^ ments, whatever may be the result. It is however on the whole desirable, and what I wish to inculcate, that the expulsion of the placenta should follow the delivery of the child in the space of from one to two honrs, according to the exigency of the case, rather than be left entirely to the efforts of nature, or be extracted immediately on the birth of the child, Should a profuse uterine haemorrhage take place on the delivery of the child, and before the exit of the placenta, and continue without restraint to discharge florid blood from tlie uterine vessels opening into its cavity, it is truly alarming, and calls for immediate assistance. Thus situated, the urgency of the case justifies the propriety of promptly removing the contents of the womb, without delay. Hence we should not halt at this stage, nor hesitate and falter between the contrariety of opinions on this obstetric question, as the OS uteri may by delay, become perma- nently contracted on the placenta, and defeat our attempts to introduce the hand, and thereby exr pose the woman to much hazard, Pursuant to

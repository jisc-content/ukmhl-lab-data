194 The advocates for immediate extraction, con- sider the placenta, an inanimate substance, and suppose it would produce dangerous effects to the mother, if allowed to remain in the uterus, after the birth ; or if the os uteri should contract before it was extruded, manual attempts would then be wholly impracticable: and also that it is an ex- traneous mass, which if left in the uterus, injurious effects would follow. Experience however, the most unerring guide, has proved each of these opinions to be incorrect, as far as relates to their being invariably relied on, and adopted as general methods of practice. Impressed by aconviction of the efficacy of nature in most instances, I am led to believe, that when art is unnecessary, manual interference becomes injurious; this is manifested on no occasion more clearly, than when the membranes are artificially ruptured during parturition, which generally in- duces a premature suspension of uterine action, before its orifice is disposed to yield naturally. Protracted labour is thereby incurred, together with a train of subsequent evils, inseparably con- nected with the whole parturient and puerperal condition; hence it is evident, that no officious interposition should take place between the ex- pulsive action of the uterus, and the advances of the head of the child in the passage, during the regular process of a natural labour, and where the

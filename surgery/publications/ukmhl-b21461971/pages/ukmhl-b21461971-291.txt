As the female pelvis is liable by disease to be contorted into different shapes and to suffer various degrees of distortion, so that delivery per vias naturales, is, in some instances, utterly impracticable; in these diversities of morbid curvature, art has furnished us with means of accomplishing delivery in several ways, accord- ing to the exigency of each deviation from the natural standard. Authors, however, even in the present improved state of midwifery, differ in opinion on many important points of practice, relative to the difficulties in question. It is therefore to be hoped that every laudable attempt to lessen the intricacy and dauger of parturition, will excite free enquiry and even- tually promote the general good. Before I proceed further, let me call the attention of the reader to the powers of nature in cases of labour, and request him to keep in view the relative pro- portions which the foetal head present to the re- spective apertures of the pelvis, in every individual case.

41 on the living subject, and therefore any inference drawn from the former to the latter operation must be inaccurate. The muscles subservient to the organs of urine, in the defunct state, have wholly lost their tone and po^er of contraction; and consequently oppose comparatively little re- sistance to the instrument in the passage. I would not have it supposed from these re- marks, that I by any means wish to discourage the anatomical student from exercising his talent on the dead subject, and I earnestly entreat him, to avail himself of every suitable opportunity of acquiring practical dexterity in this operation, but still to bear in mind the existing difference above alluded to; for the well regulated use of the sound, OT catheter, as exercised by the sur- geon, seeins to require something more of dex- terous movement, to enable the operator to aic- complish his purpose with* ease and propriety, than any other surgical operation. These ac- quirements, which result only from anatomical skill and practice, will greatly assist the surgeon in the mode of treatment, and plan of operating in the diseases incident to the peltic cavity: nor, without these essential requisites can h^'Compre- hend the reason of the difficulty in the introduction either of the catheter or sound, or know the causie of his inability to discover the stone, iri compli- cated cases. ^lii-'^/^S F

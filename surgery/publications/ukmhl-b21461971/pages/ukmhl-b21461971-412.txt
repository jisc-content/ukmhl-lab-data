For in cases where such an instrument as the Crotchet can be used with safety to the mother, so high in the pelvis or uterus as to effect a sepa- ration of the head from the body of the foetus, (the pelvis obviously well-formed) it is manifest that the hand of the accoucheur might with equal facility be conducted into the uterus, and the child turned by bringing down the feet. Or if this expedient fail, it may then be requisite to fix a noose over one or both ankles, and pulling at the ligature in a wriggling or recij)rocal direction with one hand, whilst raising the shoulder and body of the child towards the fundus uteri with the other, the process of turning may be accom- sit qui, priori similis, in interiori tantum parte pertolam aciem exacuitur.

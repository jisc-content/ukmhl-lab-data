The eminent French surgeon Le Peyronie operated in similar circumstances. See also a fatal case of a patient cut for the stone where none existed, in Desaulfs Parisian ChirurgicalJournal. There are certain diseased affections and pecu- liarities of the system which render lithotomy either unfavourable for a certain time, or wholly improper, though we are fully assured of a stone in the bladder.

I ' }46 scalpol, ill a line with Die external incision, where the resistance opposed the greatest obst^le; in this manner sufficient room was made, and the transmission of the stone effected. It was of an oval shape, and its long diameter 2.25, and its short 1.75 inches. A female sound was then passed into the bladder, and another stone de- tected larger than tlie first, and which was ex- tracted with proportionate difficulty. It was also oval, but measured 2.6 inches one way, and 2.1 the other. From the different situations in which I had an opportunity of recognising the prostate gland of this patient, both by the finger passed up the rectum, and through the v^ourid in perineo, its lateral lobes evidently pressed considerably on the rectum, and appeared the shape and size of the gizzard of a goose. Several arteries were divided in the operation, wliich required the ligature, and there remained a considerable oozing of blood, which appeared to come from the divided edges gland, to afford the stone a free exit; yet its extent was far greater than what could )je made with the gorget; hence may be seen the advantage which the bistouri possesses over tiie gorget; for the surgeon has it in his power to adapt the blade of the bistouri to the exigency of every individual case, prior to its introduction into the bladder, and should; the stone be found either of unusual magnitude, or less than what was suspected prior to commencing the operation, the screw of the handle may be elevated or depressed whilst the apex is in the bladder, and the cutting edge regulated to any given extent.

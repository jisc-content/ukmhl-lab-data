132 the gtoiiiid of its being liable to wouvid the vesi= cul(E siminales, an imputation by no means tenable; for on a retrospective enquii-y, and examination into the reality of this alleged circumstance, from patients on whom I have operated, I have found neither impotcncy nor cdrophy of the testes to have occurred in auj^ sirigle instance. Allowing the seminal duct to be divided in the operation, either with the bistouri or other instrument, it is more than probable that it would heal along with the rest of the wound, and its functions be restored after the operation. And if the cells should be obliterated, 1 am induced to believe from obser- vation and facts recorded, that the seminal vessels on the opposite side being perfect, will alone be found adequate to supply the deficiency. Heister says, " though the vesiculae seminales may be, and very often are, wounded both in the Apparatus Minoi', and in the Lateral Operation, as Le Dran, and others have observed; yet it is not generally attended with any bad consequence^ as the parts readily heal up with the rest that are divided." Objections of this soi% relative to the use of the bistouri cache, appears to be merely founded on hypothetical principles unsupported by facts. A knowledge of the physiology of i\\e duplicate organs subservient to the secretion of semen and phenomena of generation, so wisely provided by

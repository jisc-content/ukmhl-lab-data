34^ ^vhere either the pelvis was distorted, or some huprudent and oflicious steps of the accoucheur eventually produced the loss of the fcetus by this clandestine mode of delivery * Such, for example, are those related by Smellie, Gif- fard, Dease, Nihell, Portal, La Motle, Perfect and Ambrose Parey, M'here the head of the foetus was separated from the body, aud left in the Uterus, or cavity of the pelvis. Fielding Ould gives an example well worth attention, of a woman whose pelvis was much distorted, in which case he turned the foetus with a view of facilitating delivery ; unfortunately, he adds, " after many vain endeavours, I was at last obliged to separate the body from it (the head) by turning it round, whereby the neck was dislocated." Though the extent of distortion in this case is not precisely mentioned by the author, yet it must ' have been considerable ; and had he availed himself of a knowledge of the diameters of the pelvis, together with the relation it bore to the foetal head, prior to turning the child, in all pro- , bability he would have saved its life, and spared himself some unnecessary fatigue, and doubtless, * This fact I have been abundantly convinced of in those cases of distortion of the pelvis wliere the presentation has been preternatural, which occurrence I am induced to believe takes place more frequently where the pelvis is distorted than other- wise.

122 Tlie Recto-vesical operation of lithotomy has been practised in a few instances with success, both in this country and on the continent. Pro- fessor Dupuytren, of Paris, has perfornaed it with success as also an Italian surgeon, Dr. Barbantini, who has published a pamphlet on the subject. On a reference to the anatomy of the parts con- cerned in this mode of operating, it is evident that the incision of the rectum does not encounter any blood Tessels or parts directly interesting to life; and the converging rami of the ischium oppose less resistance to the extraction of the stone, than when the opening into the bladder is made in the usual place, below the pubis where the space is more limited. The recto-vesical fistula presents the most valid objection to this method of operating either on the male or female. The female urethra will permit a more free motion of the sound when searching the bladder, than that of the male, which enables the surgeon to judge more correctly of the size, situation, and shape of the stone, and greatly tends to point out the most safe and easy method of extraction. For unless the stone be of such a size as to afford a prospect of passing through the meatus urinarius by simple dilatation, without the use of undue force, I should be induced to make a lateral division of the urethra, by means of the Bistouri Cach6; as an incontinence of urine is less likely

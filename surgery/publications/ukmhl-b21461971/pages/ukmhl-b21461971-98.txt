Couillard, a French surgeon, relates several observations of encysted stones in the urinary bladder; when the stone is adherent he proposes injections of tripe broth thrown into the bladder to detach them. The same author says, that in probing a patient, he found the stone encysted; notwithstanding which, he undertook the opera- tion, being determined to tear the cysts, which he did with success, and extracted a stone as large as a hen's egg. The cyst was afterwards ex- pelled through the wound, and contained two hundred small stones, after which the paitent recovered. See latro-chirurg. obs. 2, 3, 12. M. Desault in the Parisian Chirugical Journal, has given a plate, representing an instrument he has invented, called a Kystitome, for the purpose of extracting adherent or encysted stones. The Lever or Scoop of which I have furnished a plate, appears to me to be better adapted for exploring the cavity of the bladder, with a view either of detaching enchased or sacculated stones, or of extracting them with safety, than any other instrument with which I am acquainted.

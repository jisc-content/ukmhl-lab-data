230 or inorhid aflTection of the placenta is the conse- quence, and a dispartin-^ of the connecting blood- vessels of the two organs the result. Such an oc- currence may be ascertained on an enquiry into the proximate cause, by a careful examination of the uterine region, which on pressure will give pain to the patient; and the distended ;?ane^e* will some- times also disclose the part of the viscus where the collection is seated, as though it were in a bag from which no discharge takes place externally to forewarn the accoucheur of danger. If the breach is considerable and the fluid be pent in this enclosure for a space of time sufficient to produce a vitiation of its contents the expulsive action of the uterus will probably be excited pre- maturely and labour follow; during this event clots of collected blood will be occasionally forced out, and should this evacuation be accompanied with active haemorrhage in the early months of gestation whether proceeding from fluid blood escaping outwardly or from internal disruption of the vessels which communicate with the ma- ternal portion of the placenta, the os uteri being at the same time rigid and but little dilated, the course to be pursued ought to be first directed towards checking the hemorrhage, by securing a recumbent posture, cold applications to the abdo- minal, region, plugging the vagina, and injecting a cold opiate clyster up the rectum, which will be

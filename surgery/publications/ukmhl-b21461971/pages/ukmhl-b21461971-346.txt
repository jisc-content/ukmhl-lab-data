duclion in this calamitous sitnation may Ijo made a matter of choice, may it not be allowable on dis- passionate reflection, for the mother to exercise her own jnflgnieat on the occasion, after being made acfjuainted with the probable result of each operation ? It is incumbent for the accoucheur ahvays to ascertain, if possible, the true cause of deformity in the pelvis, as there is more reason to ex'iiect a favourable result to the woman when this impedi- ment to delivery is occasioned by an accident, or injury inflicted on the bones of the pelvis from which the woman has recovered; and also in cases where the deformity is caused by Exostosis, than from a state of 3Ialacosteon where the system is morbidly afl^ected. In cases of this nature, and where the diameter of the superior aperture mea- sures no more than 3 inches from pubis to sacrum, or in either of its lateral diameters the head of the foetus will generally, by the repeated action of the uterus upon its body, be forced to a certain distance within the brim of the pelvis. When this process is so far advanced, and the head remains permanently fixed in the supeiior strait, it will be prudent to attempt delivery w ith the Lever; for I have in many instances succeeded with perfect safety both to mother and child with this instrument, even in cases where the Croichci has been used in the preceding births.

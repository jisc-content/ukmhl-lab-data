These are accidents to which it would be less exposed at an earlier period ot pregnancy under similar circumstances during its evolution from the womb. On these grounds we may account for the greater probability of rearing a premature foetus of seven, than one at eight months. There is therefore no reason for be- lieving any thing ominous in numbers; nor can I imagine any other method of elucidation,- than what is thus supported by observation and ex- perience. It may perhaps be regarded by some practi- tioners a matter of more curiosity than utility, to enquire into the history and success attendant on premature induction, and the prospect of rearing children born before the completion of the term of utero-gestation ; but the importance of the at- tempt will be readily acknowledged by every accoucheur who contemplates the subject in a moral point of view; and it is hoped that the instances on record of premature births hereafter adduced, in support of the operation, will tend to

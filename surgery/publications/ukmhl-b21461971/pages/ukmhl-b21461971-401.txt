On taking a firm hold of the feet,* they are to be brought down into tiie vagina, by a rotatory manner of proceed- ing; the shoulder will retract and delivery be effected, partly by the efforts of the mother, and partly by the accoucheur, according to the ur- gency of the case ; the success of which depends more on the prtidence and dexterity of the oper- ator, than on his strength. If on the effusion of the liquor amnii, the shoul- der be propelled low in the pelvis, and become wedged in this position, any attempts to turn the foetus will be hazardous, and the difficulty will be commensurate with the action of the uterus, and its degree of dilatation and rigidity. During the presence of these formidable obstacles, the accoucheur should be cautious of exerting much force in attempting to introduce the hand ; or what is equally dangerous, to raise the shoulder, lest a rupture of the uterus be the consequence. For it should be observed as an axiom in prac- tice, that no attempts to turn the fcetus should be made whilst the os uteri is rigid and contracted. In these cases the precipitate and premature prac- tice of rupturing the membranes, can scarcely be too scrupulously avoided, as this untimely event * Sometimes both feet cannot be seized at the same time, in which case deUvery may be attained by the aid of one.

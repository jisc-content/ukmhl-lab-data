I endeavoured to excite the action of the uterus by the motion of the hand in its cavity, but to no effect; and another and more efficient expedient occurred to me, which I immediately adopted, by passing both hands over the external surface of the uterus and endeavouring to bring in contact its interior surface, together with the incised edges of the wound Thus applying a uniformly continued pressure for a considerable time, I was able to perceive its bulk evidently lessen, and the heemorrhage greatly diminish, as though I had been compressing a sponge. Whilst waiting for the natural contraction of the uterus, I observed several vessels still pouring out a quantity of blood from the incised edges of that organ which did not wholly yield to the pressure, however applied, and fully aware of the danger attending the effusion of blood into the cavity of the abdomen, and being unfortu- nately at this critical period of the operation wholly deprived of Mr. Cort's aid, in consequence of indisposition, I was induced, in this dilemma, to pause for a short time.

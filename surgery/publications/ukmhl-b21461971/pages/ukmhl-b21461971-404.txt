394 extremities, and to reiiiaiii stationary, the ute- rus being completely dilated, and the mem- branes whole, turning may be advisable. But if all these circumstances be not combined, it is better to wait, if it can be done with propriety, for a more favourable conversion of the foetus; and thus, by a strict observance of these measures, a labour may sometimes be terminated naturally, which otherwise would have proved preternatural. Such occurrences are, however, rarely noticed by accoucheurs, and hence a very limited conception can be formed of their nature and results, unless acquired by much practical attention. The presence of an arm in the vagina, when the shoulder occupies the superior aperture of the pelvis, with the os uteri only partially dilated and the uterine action irresistible, is an obstacle suffi- cient to oppose the propriety of the introduction of the hand for the purpose of reversing the foetus, and extracting it by the feet, and this should not be attempted till the uterus has been appeased by bleeding and opiates. In such circumstances, an attempt to reduce the arm when thus protrud- ing, or to extract the foetus by violence, is neither necessary nor altogether practicable, even if the oriacium uteri were relaxed and dilated to its full extent.

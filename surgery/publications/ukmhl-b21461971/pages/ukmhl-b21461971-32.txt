24 strament. To obviate this impediment, a cathe- ter slightly curved, and pressure made on the region of the bladder, will promote the discharge of the urine when aided by a varied position of the body of the patient; and by way of conveni- ence the instrument may be retained, and the water taken off when required. In this species of retention of urine, the catheter appears indispen- sably requisite before other means can be adopted with propriety; and an early introduction is always requisite, though it only afford temporary relief; the state of the spine should not be over- looked, but must be treated according to the nature of the case. There is in some peculiar constitutions, either a wrong distribution, or a deficiency of nervous energy in the organs of urine which produces paralysis of the bladder. Such a case I have at this time under my care ; the person in other re- spects enjoys a tolerable state of health, and is able to follow his occupation; he has for several years been under the necessity of evacuating his m-ine himself, being furnished with a flexible catheter for the purpose, and which he always carries about with him. Not very dissimilar to this affection is that which is produced fi-om disobeying^the calls of nature;* * It is said that Tyclio Brahe, the celebrated astronomer, died from this cause.

The surgeon then^ begins the incision of the in- teguments with a scalpel a little below the termi- nation of the scrotum, and rather on the left side of the raphe, dividing the skin and cellular sub- stance downwards in an oblique direction, and in an equal line between the tuberosity of the left ischium and anus, to the extent of four inches and a half, (if an adult,) and ending the incision an inch below the approximation of these two parts. He next proceeds to divide the muscles of the pe- rineum, as before mentioned, (p. 97,) and lays bare the whole of the membranous part of the urethra, without interfering with the bulb; he now searches for the staff, and on pressing the fore finger of the left hand against its sulcus, with the edge of the scalpel turned upwards, he divides this membrane completely from its commencement at the anterior part of the prostate gland to the bulb.

165 'It is a fact known to physiologists, that the animal and vegetable actions are supported and carried on by a process of living and active vessels not very dissimilar from each other; consequently we occasionally witness monstrosities and^defor- mities in each kingdom, while the different states of infancy, maturity, and decay, are marked with as much seeming regularity in vegetables as in the most perfect animals. A plant can no more live without leaves and air vessels, than an animal without cuticle and lungs* Is not then the mo- tion of the sap in plants like that of the blood in animalS) produced chiefly by the action of atmos- pheric air, combined with external heat? The deformities we behold in vegetables can frequently be traced to some accident, or chemical fault in the soil; and those preternatural deviations from nature belonging to the human subject may not unaptly be exemplified by the analogy of the vegetable kingdom, in the process of healing of wounds in trees, &c. &c. We have many important facts to corroborate this opinion, which shew that the fibres and vessels of animals and vegetables are possessed of a won- derful capacity of expanding and inosculating themselves into each other, of carrying on a reci- procal circulation and becoming endued with the power of either restoring lost parts, or causing

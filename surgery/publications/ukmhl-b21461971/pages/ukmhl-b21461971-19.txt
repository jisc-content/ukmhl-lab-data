Tliese excite luidue action of the blood vessels of the j^erineum; and the prostate gland in advanced life being more disposed to enlargement than at an earlier period, the orifice of the bladder becomes in part blocked up, so that the urine seldom gets com- pletely evacuated and a sediment is left behind. When there exists in the constitution a predispo- sition to the formation of calculi, portions of gravel which pass from the ureters are retained in the cavity of this receptacle till a nucleus is formed ; and this may be one way in which calculi are pri- marily produced, and eventually become increased to a size too large to pass through the urethra naturally. Thus one disease frequently tends to aggravate another, and in this instance a retention of urine at intervals occurs; hence the aid of the catheter is required as a means of affording tem- porary relief to the patient. Most diseases of the urinary organs are marked by various diagnostic symptoms peculiar to them- selves, though often participating in some degree with other affections of the neighboui'iug parts. The symptoms attending a diseased prostate gland, and those of calculi or a morbid affection of the coats of the bladder, are so associated with each other, that no true diagnostic can be fmmed without an actual investigation, either by means of the finger passed up the rectnm, or by the sound

Premature delivery is practised under certain peculiar circumstances of deformity, for the purpose of giving the mother a chance of bearing a living child which would otherwise have eventually perished under the hand of the operator, at the full period of ges- tation. On this obstetrical subject, it is essentially ne- cessary for the accoucheur to attend to the dis- tinctive form, diameter, axis, depth, and obliquity of the female pulvis. On the various methods of delivery, in cases of deformity, it will be indis- pensably necessary as I proceed in this enquiry, to make a few observations, without examining minutely, the advantages and inconveniences re- sulting from these respective methods of operation as generally practised. The diversities of distortion incident to the fe- male pelvis, are frequently such as to involve the accoucheur in some degree of perplexity respect- ing the best mode of delivery to be adopted, for the safety of the mother and child ; and various are the resources which have been recommended for that purpose. The cruelty too frequently inflicted on the foetus, by the use of the crotchet, and the danger attendant on the mother, under certain degrees of distortion, are reasons for the induction of premature labour, with a view of preserving the

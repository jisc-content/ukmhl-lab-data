In this species of nial-presentation, and under the circum- stances above-mentioned, the arm of the foetus, however swollen or situated, cannot wholly resist the operator's efforts if judiciously exerted, for the trifling- bulk of the accoucheur's hand, when combined with the arm of the child, can never exceed that of the body or head of a mature infant, consequently can present no powerful ob- struction to the process of turning and delivering by the feet, when skilfully conducted. Oil some occasions, though the shoulder of the foetus originally presented alone, yet when the orificium uteri is become dilated and a rupture of the membranes takes place, the arm will, by the efforts of the uterus, be forced into the vasina and the hand be protruded at the os externum, or be bent in the passage, so that tfie elbow will supply its place externally. In this posture of the foetus some authors have suggested that deli- very might be effected by pulling at the arm ; others have directed to return it into the uterus and extract the foetus by the feet; whilst a third has amputated the arm at the shoulder joint, or twisted it off.

69 Notwithstanding the antiquity gf this mode of operating, I am induced, on a careful attention to tlie different steps and stages of the apparatus minor, as described by Celsus, to believe it in no respect an uneligible operation, when confined to young subjects. The method is simple and less burthened with instruments than any other plan of operation by the lateral passage, and greatly resembles the mode adopted by Cheselden and Raw. The manner of cutting on the gripe has been much modified since the time of Celsus, for instead of making a lunated incision, lithotomists have cut directly on the stone, in a line approaching nearly to the method of the lateral operation, as prac- tised at the present day with much success, and without exception to the patient's age. See GroenevelVs Dissertatio Lithologica, and the de- scription of the operation given by Alhucasis. The valuable record which Celsus has left for our instruction, in every respect deserves our commendation and attention, both regarding the operation and after-treatment of the patient.* He * "Proximo die, si spiritus difficilius redditur, si urina non excedit, si locus circa pubeni mature intumuit, scire licet, in vesica sanguinern concrelum remansisse.

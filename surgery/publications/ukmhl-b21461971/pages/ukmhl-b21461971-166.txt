158 came in view, and the muscular fibres rather receding before the edge of the knife, induced me to make a small puncture at tlie upper part of the wound, through the parietes of this viscus, from which flowed a portion of urine. By dividing the bladder with a probe pointed bistoury down- wards to the corresponding extent of the incision of the uterus, I M'as enabled to pass the fore- finger of the left hand into the cyst, wherein the stones were lodged; along which I conducted a small pair of forceps, and in the space of a few minutes extracted ten stones, all of which, ex- cept one, were alike, both in size and form; pre^ senting a peculiar porcelain polish, with their triangles as neatly rounded off, as if executed by an artist. .i/There was scarcely any blood lost during the operation; nor did the woman appear to suffer much pain. ^' lisBefore the wound was closed, I was anxious to ascertain whether the uterus and bladder by their long contact had become united by the adhesive process of nature; and on attempting to insinuate the point of the probe by the wound betwixt the edges of the incised organs, they appeared to have formed so complete a coalescence, that it became quite impracticable to effect a separation at any part of the incision.

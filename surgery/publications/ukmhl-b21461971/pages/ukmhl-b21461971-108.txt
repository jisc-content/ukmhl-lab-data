100 the assist ant, which he elevates to nearly a right angle vvitli the body of the patient, and raising himself from his seat with the staff in the left hand, and the gorget in the right, he makes a uniform pressure with one hand against the other, to main- tain their junction, gently pushing the gorget along the groove; at the same time gradually depressing the handle, so that its beak may be elevated in a direction with the axis of the bladder, till it has evidently divided the prostate gland, and passed into this viscus. This event is usually announced by a gush of urine escaping through the wound. The surgeon then keeps the gorget steady, lest its sharp edge should do injury, whilst he withdraws the staff, and passes a suitable pair of forceps along the surface of that instrument into the bladder. Or he may first cautiously with- draw the gorget immediately after it has entered this viscus, and conduct them along the side of the staff into the bladder: or what is preferable, the surgeon may insinuate his finger up the wound, on which the forceps may be slided into the cavity of this viscus, the stone be taken hold of and extracted carefully and deliberately in the axis of the outlet of the pelvis, by inclining the handles downwards in a direction with that part of the wound which opposes the least resistance, and in a way some- what similar to the method employed by an ac- coucheur, when artificially delivering the head of

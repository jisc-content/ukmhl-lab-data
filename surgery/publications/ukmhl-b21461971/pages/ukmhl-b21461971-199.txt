189 ^On t\m subject, it is remarked by Dr. Deiimaii, that " it is evident beyond all doubt, if this pro- vision had not been made, that many children must have been destroyed at the time of birth; or their parents must have died undelivered." These observations will appear confirmed by advertinj^ to the fact, that the parturient process of the lower^ classes of animals, which continue in their natural condition, has deviated comparatively little, from the state in which they were originally placed by Providence ; while those which have been brought into a state of domestication, have had their sufferings proportionably increased. Hence we are led to infer from analogy, that the parturient process is greatly deranged both in the higher and lower orders of animal creation, by artificial modes of living among brutes, and a relaxed state of moral discipline in human society. 3 This diversity in parturition may be further ex^ emplified, by referring to the inhabitants of foreign countries where women exist in comparative sim- plicity, and where labour is easily achieved. This remarkable fact being known, shews that the differenceiiitt' the event of child-birth does not wholly depend on the effects of climate, or the diversities of bodily structure. For example, let the uncivilized female be removed to this land of luxury, and her easy process of labour would readily convince the observer of the fact. Or let

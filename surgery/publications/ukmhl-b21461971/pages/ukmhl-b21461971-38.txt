30 ON THE SYMPTOMS OF STONE IN THE BLADDER, AND METHOD OF SOUNDING. Notwithstanding the elaborate researches of modern authors, the proximate cause of the pro- duction of urinary calculi appears still involved in some degree of obscurity; and different opinions are assigned on this important subject. Among Avhich may be enumerated, a peculiar structure or action of the excretory vessels of the kidneys,* and particles of blood, or inspissated matter de- posited in the infundibula, by which, on their passing along the preters into the bladder, through affinity with urine, a nucleus is formed in one,.qr, other of these receptacles, too. large to, be evacu- ated by the urethra. Or they mayj)t>A; produced by some peculiarity of constitution, or morbid condition of the part in which such depositions are formed. Few diseases,,,:tj|. which the human body is liable, are more distressing to the patient, or more dangerous in their tendency, than those of the urinary organs; and when accompanied with stone in the bladder, the pain and irritation , excited thereby, present one of the most deplo- rable maladies to which the system is subject. * This was the opinion of Platner.

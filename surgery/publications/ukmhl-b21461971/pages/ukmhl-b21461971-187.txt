The pains of labour appear to be commensurate with the deterioration to which civilized communities are subject. The obscurity which hangs over the history of the first birth, leaves the medical enquirer to mere conjecture respecting the method adopted with regard to the placenta in the case of the first offspring and during the antediluvian ages; and were it possible to discover this, such research would not satisfactorily elucidate the present sub- ject. For as the first woman existed in a state of uncorrupted simplicity, it is reasonable to conclude that little or no manual assistance for the extrac- tion of the secundines was necessary ; and if the human race had continued in its primitive state, it is very probable that there would have required no other aid for the expelling of the placenta than what is natural to the inferior species of the animal creation. Hence we might on a slight view of the subject * It is a remarkable fact and should not be overlooked, that there have been no bodily deformities observed among the native Indians of North America ; and also that fevers constitute the only diseases of importance to which they are liable.

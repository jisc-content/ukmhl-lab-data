See his Treatise on the High Operation. it is evident that there is much uncertainty in the capacity and retentive powers of this recep- tacle. In order, however, to ascertain the pleni- tude of the bladder, the finger of one hand of the surgeon may be introduced into the anus of the patient, and the other hand be laid on the hypogastrium; and by an alternate pressure from these two points, the surgeon may form a tolerable idea of the capacity of this viscns, and be enabled to ascertain, in some degree, the size and situa- tion of the stone, the state of the prostate gland, and structure of the bladder; or by observing the quantity of urine voided by the patient at different intervals before the operation. This, I conceive, is the most certain way to ascertain the quantity of fluid which may be injected into this organ with impunity, for the capacity of the bladder will de^

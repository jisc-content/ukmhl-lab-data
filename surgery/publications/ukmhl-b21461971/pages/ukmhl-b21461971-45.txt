37 yel I am induced to believe that a solid one of steel will produce a more distinct and characteris- tic sensation to the touch, than one of silver or any other ductile substance; as the undulations of the urine, when issuing through the eyes of the instrument, may impose on the sensation of the surgeon, and embarrass his judgment. - After the many different attempts made by modern surgeons in the construction of instru- ments employed in Lithotomy, the thickness of the sound, more than any other circumstance, seems to have escaped their attention. With the view of obviating certain difficulties, which frequently occur when searching for the stone in the bladder, I am induced to make a few observations on the use and construction of the sound, as represented in the annexed plate ;^ >i>'/â€¢ ] which instrument I have been in the habit of using for several years past, and which is now pre- fierred by many surgeons of this county. This instrument will be found to pass along the canal of the urethra, and be moved when in the cavity of the bladder, with greater facility by the sur- geon, and ease to the patient, than those modelled in the ordinary way. Consequently, when there exist much disease and irritation of the parts, the calculus is more readily discovered, and be- comes more tangible, than by one constructed in the ordinary way.

143 withstaiKliug the antiphlogistic mode of treat- ment was rigourously adhered to, there remained a considerable degree of soreness on the region of the pubis, attended with quick pulse and fever, insomuch that I did nottlien propose the operation- of lithotomy, being aware of the consequences that might ensue from the attendant symptoms', excited by irritation, and the effects of calculi, on the coats of the bladder; nevertheless, the tension and soreness of the abdomen gradually abated, and the operation appeared admissible;* after being determined on, and the preparitory regimen adopted, 1 performed it on the 17th instant attention to the s^'mptoms, be distinguished from an irritable or indurated state of that viscus; for in the former affection, and during the discharge of urinei the pain increases at the glans- penis till the last drop is voided and subsides gradually; while in the latter case, relief is observed to take place in a reverse ratio,- for as soon as the water begins to flow the patient is some- what relieved, and when the whole is evacuated there is com- paratively little pain left, and the expansive functions of the bladder are sooner restored, * It does not appear from the result of practice, that simple irritation excited by calcuU in the bladder, is an insuperable ob- jection to lithotomy, when performed during an interval of cessation from pain ; but if there exist in the system any nephritic affection, or insidious morbid action lurking in any organ, either remotely or immediately essential to hfe, the danger becomes manifestly increased, and the operation should be undertaken with great caution, and deferred, if possible, till such symptoms, wholly cease, and the irritation of the system subside. /

152 A CASE OF LITHOTOMY ON A FEMALE, COMPLI- CATED WITH PROCIDEN'J lA UTERI, PROCIDENTIA VESICAE, AND INVERTED VAGINA. Mary Barnhill, aged 52, an inhabitant of Blackburn, is the subject of this interesthig case. In the 24th year of her age, she bore an illegitimate child at the full period of gestation, about 32 years ago ; and whether to impute the cause of her affliction, which commenced soon after de- livery, to some improper interference of the attending accoucheur during that process, or to a relaxed state of the ligaments of the uterus, it is not at this remote period easy to determine ; more particularly, as this part of the history of the ex- isting malady, is taken from the woman's own narrative. She states, that a few days after labour, she was seized with a painful pressing sensation about the groins, w^hich eventually produced a tumour that descended through the vagina, and appeared protruded at the external parts, and kept advancing downwards between the thighs and increasing in- size, without interruption, to nearly the dimensions of the annexed Plate, in less than two years subsequent to the time of parturition.

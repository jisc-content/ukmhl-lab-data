400 under certain parturient conditions, which are generally concealed from us, will sometimes take place ; and granting to tlie inherent efforts of the uterus its fall power, there is reason to believe, that were every case of the presentation of the shoulder left entirely to the efforts of nature many lives would be thereby sacrificed, which by a timely and well-regulated interference, might be preserved. It is, I presume; only a very rare occurrence when the evolution terminates the deli- very, and that almost always with destruction to the child ; and it is not a little surprising, that the discovery of such a phenomenon should have es- caped the notice of all authors anterior to the time of Schoeriheider^ and the late Dr. Denman, more especially during that period when the art that a scarlet thread was tied upon the hand, and was the latter of the two children which came forth. How this reversion of the fcetus in utero was effected, I will not attempt to explain ; but it appears the midwife was a little surprised at the occur- rence, for she exclaimed, " How hast thou broken, forth ! this breach be upon thee !" which expression is evidently a convincing proof that such incident was uncommon in her practice : and that she was hot in the habit of turning the foetus and delivering by the feet. Docs not the successful event of Titmar's case abundantly prove what it is my wish to establish in the following pages, namely, that the indiscriminate practice of turning in presentation of the hand, too generally adopted by practitioners of the present day, is improper? >uÂ». * Acta Havn.

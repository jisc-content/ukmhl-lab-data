294 This tactile method of [)roceet]ing, will generally furnish the accoucheur with an adequate know- ledge of the dimensions of the pelvis, in almost every degree of morbid and mal-formed structure. In such adverse and distorted cabes, it requires more than ordinary circumspection to select the most eligible resources for ensuring a happy event both to mother and child ; and it is incumbent on the accoucheur in every preceding instance, where he has been under the necessity of terminating delivery with the Crotchet, to procure the precise dimensions of the pelvis in all its diameters before he leaves the woman, in order that he may be armed with every requisite auxiliary in future labour, and this information may be most satis- factorily acquired by means of the touch as has been before mentioned. As the pelvic cavity is completely lined with Heshy texture, the apertures will, it is presumed, be varied a few lines less or more in proportion to the extent of difficulty, and the duration of labour ; and these essential circumstances the accoucheur is particularly requested to bear in mind as he proceeds in this enquii-y, in order that our ad- justments may agree as to the relative proportions between the capacity of the foetal head, and the cavity of the mother s pelvis duruig labour. To accjuire with mathematical precision by means of the touch, the diversities and disproportions of mal-

By this enquiry the accoucheur will be enabled to regulate his proceedings. Thus situated, it may be prudent to accomplish delivery by taking hold of the funis with one hand, and keeping it distended, while the fingers of the other are insinuated along the cord; by which means the position of the placenta may be adjusted, and if no other obstacle intervene, it may be extracted without delay as before directed. If, nevertheless, its detention in utero arise from a temporary defect or suspension of the contractile powers of that organ, in consequence of being harrassed by officious interference or exhausted by protracted labour, in either case, by gentle pressure on the abdomen with the hand, the substance of the uterus in the region of the pubis will convey an uncontracted and flabby feel to the touch, and not that tense globular sensation which is usual in cases where art has not interposed, and where nature is able to effect her own purpose.

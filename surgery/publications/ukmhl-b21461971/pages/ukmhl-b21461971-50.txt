42 In some instances of retention of urine, which have fallen under my notice, connected with morbid affection of the neck of the bladder, and prostate gland, the patient has suffered by the violent and ill directed efforts of the surgeon, occasioned by a negligent deviation in the position of the patient during the operation, or by rash and improper guidance of the instrument. The certainty of accomplishing this operation without embarrassment, arises from bearing in mind the relative curvature of the instrument, and canal of the urethra, as its point traverses along from the glans penis, to the entrance of the bladder. The obstacles and perplexity connected with the treatment of the diseases of these organs, are often so peculiarly complicated, that it requires the greatest caution in the surgeon, to pass an instrument into the bladder without inflictins: injury to the patient. Hence the catheter, staff', or sound, bear such affinity of construction and method of introduction to each other, that I wish these remarks to be considered as equally ap- plicable to each respectively, unless otherwise specified. To accomplish this delicate and sometimes difficult operation with ease and facility, the sur- geon should be furnished with a variety of sounds of different degrees of curvature, length, and diameter, adapted to all ages.

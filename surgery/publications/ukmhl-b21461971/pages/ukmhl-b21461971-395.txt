385 and roll the woman and make her jump on the bed ; and if these means failed, he further advises to dismember the foetus, and extract it with in- struments ; for he allows no species of presenta- tioa to be natural except that of the head alone first presenting-. This sentiment was so generally adopted that Pliny* established it in his time as an axiom, that the order of Nature is to enter into the world by the head, and to go out of it by the feet. Aristotle and Galen were of the same opi- nion, and regarded the delivery by the feet as foreign to nature. A mong other authors who embraced the same doctrine, are Mercurialis, Galeatius, Lazarus Pe, Eucharius Rhodion, Marcetus, Varundus, and Perdulcis; and Riverius, a Physician of great reputation, even in the year 1657, condemned delivery by the feet. oranes diraissis nianibus crura appreliendant, eamque crebro in lecte concutiant, facta in humeros rejectione ut in ampliorem locum concussus foetus convertatur et naturaliter piodire posset. De foetus in utero mortui exsectione.â€”Tom. 12, Pa^. 551. Ibid Pag. 768. * Pliny was cotemporary with the Emperors Vesjmsian and Titus, and though not himself a Physician, yet in conde/nning the dehvery by the feet as being unnatural, we may from hence form a pretty accurate knowledge of the general practice of the times in which he lived ; for he expressly says, " Tliat liiey called tiie children which were born in this manner Agrippas; importing th;it they were born with much pajii." 3 c

115 ON LITHOTOMY ON WOMEN. The female sex are much less liable to stone in the bladder than males, and consequently seldom require the operation. The reason is obvious; for the neck of the female bladder is not surrounded with the prostate gland as in men, and the urethra is much shorter, less curved, and more exten- sible. These circumstances render the sponta- neous expulsion of calculi a more common occur- rence : and hence we can account for numerous instances of very large stones having been naturally voided through the urethra, or extracted by that passage, after being artificially dilated. The chief symptoms of stone in the bladder of women, are, a burning heat at the extremity of the meatus urinarius, a bearing down of the uterus^ with frequent inclination to go to stool; in other respects, the symptoms are similar to those in men. To the danger and inconveniences attending the Marian operation, and the advantages deduced by the lateral method on men, may be ascribed the present mode of relieving M'omen from the stone by means of the gorget, instead of that by dilatation.

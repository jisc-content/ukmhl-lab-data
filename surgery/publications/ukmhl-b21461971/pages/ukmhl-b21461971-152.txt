' 144 (November,) in the presence of two assisting surgeons and the necessary attendants. Tlie pa- tient being placed and secured in a horizontal po- sition upon a steady table of commodious height, and supported by pillows under the shoulders with the breach projecting a little over the edge of the table, the first stages of the operation were conducted in the usual manner, and with tolerable facility. On the membranous portion of the urethra being laid open with the scalpel to the commencement of the prostate gland, the beak of the bistouri cache was inserted into the groove of the staff, the handle of which was taken hold of with the left hand, and raised from the right groin of the patient to nearly a right angle with the body; the bistouri was then pushed gently for- wards into the bladder and the staff taken out; the cutting edge being raised from its sheath and turned rather laterally towards the left ischia of the pa- tient, it was withdrawn nearly in a horizontal direc- tion ; and in executing this step of the operation, I perceived an unusual resistance and grating, as if cutting through a cartilaginous substance. The fore finger of the left hand was now passed as high as possible into the bladder, through the opening made by the bistouri, ^and with difficulty the sm'face of a stone w^s felt; for, owing to the patient's state of corpulency, the cliief part of the hand became buried in the woiuid.

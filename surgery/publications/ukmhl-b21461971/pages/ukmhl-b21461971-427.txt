417 this sjDecies of mal-positiou, is not necessary, noi- ls the reduction of either of the superior extremi- ties absolutely requisite, when the pelvis is known to be well-forined, except by means of plugging, as before directed, under certain peculiar condi- tions, and previously to the head being fixed in the superior aperture. Under these circumstances it will be w^ll to bear in mind the extent of the powers of nature; yet it may not be on every occasion the most prudent step to rely wholly on her efforts. For if when called to a woman in labour of her first child, with one or both hands presenting and the head halting on the brim of the pelvis, the liquor amnii evacuated and the os uteri amply dilated, I should not hesitate to intro- duce the hand, and turn the foetus by bringing down the feet. Still I am fully aware that cases will occasionally occur, where the accoucheur may with propriety exercise a choice either of leaving the event wholly to nature, or having re- course to art; for it is extremely difficult to adapt rules of practice to every variety of presentation, and the accoucheur will on many occasions, be under the necessity of adopting measures for which writers on midwifery have not furnished him with precepts.

For it is evident that women inured to the European modes of life, cannot with impunity during labour, use the same exertions as those whose habits have been more consonant to the dictates of nature. The expulsion of the placenta and its mem- branous attachment is generally the work of nature, which is indicated soon after the termi- nation of labour, by a continuance of the inherent paroxysms of uterine action, aided by the powers of the abdominal muscles and diaphragm which expel the child; and this is usually completed in the space of ten or fifteen minutes after the birth.

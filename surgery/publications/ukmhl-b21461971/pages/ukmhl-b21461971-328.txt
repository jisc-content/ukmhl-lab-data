318 fluctuating by the interposition of casual agents luider such contrary circumstances, tliat it is altogether improbable that it should be influenced by the power of such periodical seasons. It is probable from the physiology and history of utero gestation, that the foetus makes constant and progressive advances towards perfection and vigour, from the time of conception to the full period of pregnancy. It may however, be proper to advert to the probable causes of a foetus born at the eighth month of gestatior), being more feeble and less likely to survive its birth than one of seven months, as Hippocrates and many other Physicians main- tain. It is granted that there are more seven months children reared than those of eight, and daily observations sufficiently prove that abortions take place more frequently about the seventh month than at any other period of gestation. To account for this fact, it may be remarked, that there is comparitively a greater yielding of the cervix uteri at this time, than at the eighth month. The functions of the uterus manifest less resis- tance to the causes which oppose parturition, and its neck unfolds its contractions with greater fa- cility. The foetal head is also somewhat less, and parturition is rendered easier. During no stage of gestation docs the uterus perform its per-

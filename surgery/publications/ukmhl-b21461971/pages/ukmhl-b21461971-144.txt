If, however, these means fail in subduing the inflammation, and pain and tension of the abdomen continue, it will be expedient to repeat the warm bath two or three times a day, together with bleeding both locally and generally. Blisters and fomentations of the abdomen, aided by the free use of emollient clys- ters and purgatives, must be assiduously em- ployed to repel the attack. On some occasions frequently bathing the w'ound and neighbouring parts with cold water may be useful, and tend to abate inflammation and prevent haemorrahage. In the treatment of patients subsequent to litho- tomy, the practitoner should bear in mind that a feeble pulse is a frequent attendant on all abdo- minal inflammations; and he ought not to be deterred from the use of the lancet, by such fallacious symptoms, but on all occasions keep in view the age and plethoric state of the pa- tient, and regulate the treatment accordingly; for in old emaciated subjects the antiphlogistic mode should be pursued with great caution, particularly after a tedious operation, lest the patient should sink from exhaustion^

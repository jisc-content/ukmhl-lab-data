387 Mosch'um, Paulus jEginelta, Seraphion, Avicen- no, P/iilomenes, Mariuello, and Albucasis, who all recommend delivery by the feet in certain preter- natural presentations. Hence it appears that this contrariety of proceeding was disputed till nearly the close of the sixteenth century, and together with some rude and uncouth projects in the art was the mode chiefly adopted till the time of Ambrose Parey, who about this period published his work on the Generation of Man; wherein he boldly rejects the preposterous customs so long established by preceding authors, and expressly points out, with much precision, the great im- provement in the obstetric art by turning the foetus and delivering by the feet, in all unnatural pre- sentations.* During the latter part of the fifteenth century this important art assumed a new era. But im- , X * Parey may also justly be ranked amongst the first who introduced the practice of turning the foetus in cases of uterirfe hsemorrhage ; though his work is silent on that head^ yet his pupil Guillemeau acknowledges this when attending Mad. Simon, daughter to Ambrose Parey. Louisa Burgeois, who published a Treatise on Midwifery, about the year 1609, mentions this mode of deHvery in cases of flooding during pregnancy.â€”See Chap. 4 and 5. Puzos, a celebrated accoucheur of Paris, likewise claims our early acknowledsfment for having so ably illustrated this subject. See the Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Surgery at Paris.

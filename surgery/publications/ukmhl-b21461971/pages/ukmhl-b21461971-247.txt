The uterus, like other muscular organs, is oc- casionally liable to irregular actions of its fibres, either during the period of parturition, or after- Avards; and this is a frequent and important cir- cumstance attendant on uterine haimorrhage. The spasmodic action of the uterus may, 1 conceive, be very properly classed under two distinct heads, namely, simple and compound.

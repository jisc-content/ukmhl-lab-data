STRUCTURE OF THE SHOULDER-JOINT. 415 from injury by the tendinous insertions of muscles, the capsular ligament itself is thickened, and is capable of sustaining great vio- lence ; and this difference is remarkably shewn in that part of the ligament which is placed in the axilla, it being of a strong tendinous nature. Four muscles are destined to move the os humeri, and to Muscles of |strengthen the capsular ligament. The first, the supra-spinatus, fJthTjoint which arises from the fossa supra-spinata, covers the head of the bone, blends its tendon with the capsular ligament, and is inserted into the larger tubercle; the second, the infra-spinatus muscle, which proceeds from the fossa infra-spinata, adheres to the back part of the capsular ligament, and is also fixed to the greater tubercle; the third, the teres minor, which arises from the lower edge of the scapula, adheres to the back part of the capsular ligament, and is inserted into the greater tubercle, and into the cervix humeri; the fourth, is the subscapularis muscle, which fills up the venter, or inner concave surface of the scapula; it passes over the inner side of the head of the bone, and is fixed to the smaller tubercle, firmly adhering to the capsular ligament as it passes over its inferior and inner surface. It is between the sub- iscapularis muscle, and the teres minor, that the capsular ligament is found of great strength, as there are no muscles inserted into that part to protect the joint from injury. The deltoid muscle, the coraco-brachialis, and the teres major, Muscles of which are also muscles of this joint, are not united with the t0 the capsular ligament as the other muscles, being only destined for the motion, and not particularly for the projection of the shoulder- joint. The tendon of the long head of the biceps protects the upper Tendon of the |part of the joint, where it otherwise would be weak ; for this blcePsâ€™ tendon is situated between that of the supra-spinatus and sub- scapularis : it arises from the upper point of the edge of the glenoid cavity of the scapula, and passes over the head of the bone into the groove between the two tubercles and the portion of the capsular ligament.

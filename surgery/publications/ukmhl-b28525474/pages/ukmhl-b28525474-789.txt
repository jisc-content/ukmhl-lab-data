ON CRURAL HERNIA. 125 of the inguinal hernia is above the spine ; also, by drawing down a femoral hernia, Poupart’s ligament may be traced above it, i which it cannot be if the disease be inguinal. I have seen a case of enlargement of the femoral vein, which Varicose vein, i had somewhat the appearance of a femoral hernia, but it was readily detected, by pressing on the iliac vein above, while the patient was recumbent, when the tumour immediately appeared. Femoral hernia is most frequent upon the right side, probably This hernia on account of most persons employing that side in the greatest ^^right side0" degree. Women who have borne many children are more liable to this Mothers liable disease than others, which arises from the extension of the abdo- t0 lt- Iminal parietes during gestation, causing a more relaxed state of the parts ; also, old persons are more frequently troubled with this disease than the young. Most frequently the protruded part in femoral hernia is small Most frequently intestine, very rarely only omentum, but occasionally both intes- tine and omentum. I have seen the coecum in a femoral hernia i on the right side, and the ovaria have also been found in the her- j nial sac. The femoral hernia is produced by the same causes as occasion Causes, the formation of inguinal hernia, except that I do not recollect a single instance in which this disease has been originated by a blow. — EXPLANATION OF PLATE X.

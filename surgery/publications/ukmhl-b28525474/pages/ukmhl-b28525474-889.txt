213 WOUNDS OF THE CHEST AND LUNG. WOUNDS OF THE CHEST. These are also of two kinds :—First, wounds of the parietes. Second, wounds of the viscera. Wounds of the parietes are not attended with much danger. A boy fell from a tree upon some pales, which entered his I chest between the seventh and eighth ribs, tearing his intercostal muscles freely. The air rushed violently into his chest at each respiration, and was again expelled, when the anterior surface of the lungs appeared at the wound. The edges of the wound were I brought together by adhesive plaister, a roller was applied tightly round the chest to confine the motion of the ribs, and he was bled very freely. He did extremely well. A man was brought into St. Thomas’s Hospital who had been stabbed between the cartilages of his ribs ; he bled very profusely, and I thought the internal mammary artery was wounded, but the bleeding soon subsided, and he recovered. The treatment in wounds of the parietes of the chest, is to promote as much as possible the adhesive inflammation, to close the wound externally. If there be bleeding from the intercostal artery, the finger should be pressed upon the orifice of the vessel, until the disposi- tion to haemorrhage ceases. A man died in Guy’s Hospital, who had been wounded through :he intercostal muscles with an iron spindle, the wound healed, but etanus supervened, of which he died. Upon inspecting the chest ifter death, the lung was found to have assisted in closing the vound, by adhering to the injured pleura. OF WOUNDS OF THE LUNG. When this happens, the circumstance is known by the patient’s oughing up florid and frothy blood ; by free bleeding from the vound, if sufficiently large to permit its escape ; by considerable iritation and tickling in the larynx, and by dyspnea.

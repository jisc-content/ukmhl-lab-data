DISLOCATION OF THE TARSAL BONES. 395 of the tibia inwards is produced, and the foot is elevated between the two malleoli. The treatment required in this case is the same as in the dislocation inwards. Oblique compound fractures into the ancle-joint generally do well if care be taken to produce adhesion of the wound, which is to be effected by applying lint, imbrued in blood, to the lacerated skin, and by leaving it there until it separates spontaneously. The same bandages and splints are required as in simple fractures, but the position must be varied according to the situation of the wound. Even if suppuration occurs the patient will generally recover, unless he be much advanced in years. But if, with compound fracture into the joint, there be much com- minution of bone, and haemorrhage from any large vessel, it will be proper to amputate immediately, more especially if the patient be obliged to obtain his bread by his labour; for after recovery, under great comminution, the limb will bear but slight exertion. DISLOCATION OF THE TARSAL BONES. SIMPLE DISLOCATION OF THE ASTRAGALUS. The astragalus is connected above and on each side with the tibia and fibula by its trochlea; below it has articulatory surfaces for its junction with the os calcis, to which it is united by means of a capsular and strong interosseous band of ligament; and anteriorly to the os naviculare, by a capsular, broad, and internal lateral ligament. A simple dislocation of the astragalus some- times, though rarely, occurs; a compound luxation is still more rare. I A simple luxation of the astragalus is a most serious accident, being very difficult to reduce ; and should the reduction not be effected, the patient is ever after doomed to a considerable degree of lameness.

370 TREATMENT. The fibrinous calculus, observed by Dr. Marcet, was probably formed from the fibrin of blood which had accidentally escaped into the bladder: it possessed the usual character of fibrin. Mr. Brande analyzed one hundred and fifty stones, from the collection of Mr. Hunter, and the materials of which they were composed were as follow: Uric acid 16 Uric acid plus, triple phosphate minus 45 Uric acid minus, triple phosphate plus 66 Triple phosphate 12 Uric acid on phosphate nuclei 5 Oxalate of lime 6 In addition to these, Dr. Wollaston found one of the cystic oxide; but Dr. Marcet met with this stone in the kidney: it is not composed of lamellae, like the other calculi. TREATMENT. Medical treatment. Cose. With respect to the medical treatment of calculi, I do not believe in the power of chemistry to dissolve a stone in the bladder, if it acquire any considerable magnitude. The medicines, given for this purpose, become so much changed in their passage through the circulating and secreting system, that their chemical influence is in a great measure destroyed. They may alter the surface of a stone, so as to render it soft and less irritating; but they do not prevent a calculous secretion. Dr. Baillie and myself attended a gentleman from Birmingham, who secreted a large quantity of triple phosphate, which appeared in white crystals in his urine: we gave him the muriatic acid, and the secretion of the triple phosphate ceased, but uric acid was produced in equal abundance: he had then alkalies given to him, and the triple phosphate reappeared; he was at length, but not under many months, cured by attention to his diet and general health.

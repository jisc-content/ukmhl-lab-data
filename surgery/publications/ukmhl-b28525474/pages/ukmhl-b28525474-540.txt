A probe being introduced, it passes into the suppurating- cavity communicating- with the rectum. In this case it will be proper to perform the operation which has been described for the first state of fistula when there is an opening externally, and within the rectum. The fourth and last state is, that in which the sinus or sinuses extend from the anus into the nates. The practice I pursue is, then to divide the opening in the nates through the external skin, but leave that near the anus at first undivided, and when I have healed this part, then operate upon the other in the same manner as in the second kind of fistula. OF TREATMENT AFTER THE OPERATION. When the fistula has been divided, put dry lint into the wound, and compress the part until all bleeding has stopped. On the following morning apply a poultice, and in two or three days the lint will separate. Then pass a probe into the wound often, to prevent the union of the sides of the sinus for five or six days from the operation, and continue to poultice; but after this time, when granulations arise, it is right to introduce lint into the wound, and prevent their inosculation, until the wound, gradually granulating every where, the cavity becomes filled. If lint be introduced into the wound on the second, or third, or following days from the operation, great pain is given, and much inflammation is excited, so that there is danger of fresh suppuration: wait, therefore, until the inflammation has ceased, and then introduce but a small quantity of lint, and with great gentleness. If the sore be very indolent, occasionally purge the patient, and give him the confectio piperis, which produces very healthy granulations, and apply to the wound lint dipped in a solution of the sulphate of copper, or spread with the unguentum hydrargyri nitrico oxydi.

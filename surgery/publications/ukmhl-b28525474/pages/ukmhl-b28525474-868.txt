192 ON THE TREATMENT OF Frequently wounded. High up in the groin. RADIAL ARTERY. This artery is much more frequently wounded than the ulna, being in every respect more exposed. The application of two l ligatures is equally necessary, as in the ulna, and for the same reason. This vessel is readily found on the outer side of the flexor carpi radialis, and it is not accompanied by any nerve of magnitude. OF THE PALMAR ARTERIES. Wounds of the palmar vessels are very frequent, but generally the bleeding may be stopped by steady and continued pressure, by means of a compress and bandage, and by a tourniquet on the brachial artery; the application of cold, and attention to position, â–  will materially assist. Should these means fail to arrest the bleed- ing, and if the openings of the divided vessel cannot be easily found, it will be necessary to secure the ulna, or radial arteries, or both; as from the very free communication of these vessels, the securing of one only, will not, in many instances, prevent further bleeding. It will be best, however, in wounds of the superficial palmar arch, under such circumstances, first to put a- ligature upon the ulna artery, and then try pressure again, before the radial is taken up ; which should not be done unless a trouble- some haemorrhage continues. On the contrary, should the deep palmar arch be the seat of injury, and it become necessary to secure an artery, the radial should be first tied, and afterwards, provided the bleeding does not stop, the ulnar should be likewise secured. OF THE FEMORAL ARTERY. If this artery be wounded high up in the groin, the finger must be thrust into the wound to stop the bleeding, until a compress can be applied upon the pubes, and the vessel be secured.

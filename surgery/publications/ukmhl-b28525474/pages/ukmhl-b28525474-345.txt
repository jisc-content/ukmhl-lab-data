OF THE DISSECTION OF THE INGUINAL CANAL. 281 There is a second artery in the spermatic cord, which begins from one of the vesical arteries, a branch of the hypogastric, near the remains of the umbilical artery, where several vesical branches arise. This deferential artery divides into two sets of branches, one set descending to the vesicula seminalis, and to the termination of the vas deferens; the other, ascending upon the vas deferens, runs in a serpentine direction upon the coat of that vessel, passing through the whole length of the spermatic cord; and when it reaches the cauda epididymis, it divides into two sets of branches—one advancing, to unite with the spermatic artery, to supply the testicle and epididymis—the other passing backwards to the tunica vaginalis and cremaster. THE ABSORBENT VESSELS OF THE TESTICLE. These vessels arise both from the coats of the testicle and from its internal structure. They unite upon the cord, and form three or four trunks, which ascend upon the spermatic veins :— they pass through the inguinal canal, and when they enter the cavity of the abdomen, their numbers are diminished, but their size is increased;— they ascend with the spermatic vein, on the right side quit it to cross the vena cava, and terminates in three or four absorbent glands by the side of the aorta , near the origin of the spermatic artery. On the left side, they pass into glands in contact with the aorta, just below the renal artery. The absorbents of the tunica vaginalis terminate in those of the testis. OF THE DISSECTION OF THE INGUINAL CANAL. This canal is bounded at the lower part by the external abdominal ring, formed by the tendon of the external oblique muscle; at its upper part by the internal ring, formed by the fascia transversal is. In dissecting it, after removing the integuments, the superficial fascia of the tendon of the external oblique muscle is laid bare. Absorbents. Inguinal Canal.

55 OF THE REDUCIBLE INGUINAL HERNIA, ETC. The enlargement of the uterus in pregnancy sometimes occa- sions hernia, but less frequently the inguinal than the other spe- cies. Distention of the stomach operates in a similar way. A frequent and forcible pressure or shaking of the viscera down- wards, as happens in riding in rough carriages, is a common cause of this complaint. In the town of Yarmouth, where I for- merly lived, I knew many persons who had this disease brought on by riding in the small carts peculiar to that town, and which, from being constructed without springs, were rough and uneasy, and shook the rider in a very severe manner. Coachmen who are much upon, and persons who ride rough going horses, are for the same reason liable to this complaint. The cavalry are much more subject to it than the infantry; and I have known chil- dren in whom it has been produced by frequent riding in company with older persons, and constantly going a pace uneasy to them. Jumping operates in the same way, often suddenly. I have known many persons, after much of this exercise, complain of a pain in the groin, which was soon followed by hernia. In these and every other cause of the complaint, an upright posture of the body strongly contributes to its formation, by keeping up the pressure of the viscera on the lower part of the abdomen. LECTURE XLII. â€¢ OF THE REDUCIBLE INGUINAL HERNIA, AND USE OF TRUSSES. Hernde are found in the three following conditions, reducible, irreducible, and strangulated. The reducible is that state in which the protruded parts may be returned into the cavity of the abdomen; and as it is attended with no immediate danger to the patient, frequently induces in his mind a false idea of security. A person under these circum- stances lives in continual danger, as numerous accidental causes may produce strangulation of the prolapsed intestine, the conse- Reducible ingui- nal hernia.

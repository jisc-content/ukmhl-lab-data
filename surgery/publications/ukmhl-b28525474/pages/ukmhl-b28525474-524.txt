OPERATIONS FOR RETENTION OF URINE. 408 Situation. Size. Composition. Operation to extract them. Causes. continues, I am advised to go to the coast.” On putting my finger under his tongue, I felt a calculus, which I immediately removed, and in a week he was well. These calculi are generally situated in the trunk of the duct, but sometimes in its branches within the substance of the gland. The largest I have seen was of the size of an almond deprived of its shell; I have seen one fluted so as to allow of the passage of the saliva through the depression. They are composed of phosphate of lime. The operation for their removal is to be performed as follows :— the' cheek is drawn back by means of a blunt hook introduced at the angle of the mouth ; the duct is pressed upwards by the finger of an assistant, placed under the lower jaw : an incision is then made, with a pointed and curved bistory, upon the stone from under the tongue, within the mouth, so as to divide the lining membrane of the mouth and open the submaxillary duct; the stone being exposed, is to be brought from its situation by means of a small hook which is to be passed under it. If the stone be deep seated in the substance of the gland, a small pair of forceps are required to extract it. LECTURE XXXIII. OPERATIONS FOR RETENTION OF URINE. It is not my intention, in the present Lecture, to enter into a detailed description of the causes which give rise to the retention of urine ; but merely here to state them generally, and at a future time give a more particular account of each. The causes which I have known produce retention of urine in the male are: 1. A narrow orifice to the urethra. 2. A congenital obstruction in the urethra. 3. Permanent stricture.

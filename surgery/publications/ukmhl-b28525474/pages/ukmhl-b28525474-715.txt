In an old irreducible hernia the omentum often becomes dis- Diseased eased. I have seen it affected with schirrus, that is not the schirrus which terminates in cancer, but forming a large and very firm tumour. A specimen of this form of the disease is preserved in the Museum of Saint Thomasâ€™s Hospital. Hydatids have been known to be produced in it, but I have never seen an instance of it. When suppuration occurs, it produces an external abscess. An instance of this happened in a woman who had an abscess in the omentum which had arisen from an old irreducible omental hernia. STRANGULATED HERNIA. This form of the disease consists, not only of an irreducible | state of the intestine or omentum, but of such a compression of the blood-vessels as to excite inflammation, and totally to interrupt the ! passage of the faeces through the strangulated portion.

To these succeed frequent eructations and vomiting, and presently, as an antiperistaltic motion is established through the intestine, bilious matter is brought up. Indeed, when the strangulation has taken place in the colon, I have seen faeculent matter discharged by vomiting, a circumstance which is accounted for, when it is considered that the valve at the end of the ilium is often imperfect, and especially that an antiperistaltic motion will reverse the operation of this 1 valve as well as of the rest of the intestinal canal. I have seen this symptom so often, that I can entertain no doubt on the 1 subject. An obstinate constipation attends the vomiting, so that no stools First stage, f 2

OF WOUNDS OF JOINTS. 225 by their irritating the wound; and if adhesion or granulation have taken place to close the wound, such tubes tear it open again and destroy the process of restoration. LECTURE LI. WOUNDS OF JOINTS. These accidents are hut trivial, or very dangerous, as the surgeon is directed by proper principles, or is ignorant of the treatment which they require. If the patient has a poultice applied, or if the utmost attention Improper treat- be not paid to the immediate closure of the wound, inflammation me'U' of the synovial membrane arises, and suppuration ensues. The most violent constitutional irritation succeeds,—shivering, heat, flushing, and profuse perspiration; generally, great swelling and excessive pain in the joint. Abscesses form in different parts of the joint, one succeeding another, until the strength becomes ex- hausted. In young and healthy constitutions, these wounds in the largest In young or old joints are recoverable from; but, in aged and weak persons, they persons’ destroy life. Upon dissection in the first stage, suppurative inflammation of Dissection of. the synovial membrane is found ; in the second sta^e, the ligaments of the joint are thickened, and the synovial membrane in part ulcerated, in part granulating. The cartilages are absorbed; granu- lations arising from some parts of the bones, and exfoliation taking place from other portions. Recovery from these injuries when inflammation has followed, Anchylosis, is by adhesion, so as to destroy the synovial surface; or else

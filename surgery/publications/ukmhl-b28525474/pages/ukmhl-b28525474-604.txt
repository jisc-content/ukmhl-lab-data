488 OF AMPUTATION AT THE IIIP-JOINT. Vessels. Dressing. Femoral artery to be secured first. Mode of doing it. Operation. The following vessels will require the application of ligatures; the femoral branches of the profunda, and sometimes the sciatic. The integument is to be brought over the end of the stump from side to side, and confined by straps of adhesive plaster, after which the patient is to be placed upon his back in bed, and a pillow should be put under the upper part of the thigh so as to elevate the stump. OF AMPUTATION AT THE IIIP-JOINT. In this amputation it is decidedly the safest plan to secure the femoral artery by a ligature at Poupart’s ligament, as the first step of the operation. An incision is begun two inches above the middle of Poupart’s ligament and is extended two inches below it: the femoral artery is to be laid bare, and the ligature introduced at the centre of the incision is to be tied upon the denuded vessel opposite Poupart’s ligament, and above the arteria profunda. A long catling is then used to make the inner incision through the integument and muscles. This incision is to be begun at the lower part of that which was made to expose the artery, and it is to be carried from thence on the inner side of the thigh obliquely downwards, and is then continued on the outer side of the thigh below the trochanter major to the point at which it began ; in this way a larger portion of integument is left to form a covering to the stump than would be produced by a circular incision without obliquity. In the same line a second incision is to be made to divide the muscles, but the edge of the knife is to be inclined obliquely upwards towards the joint, and the integument and muscles being drawn back, those of the latter which are inserted into the trochanter major should be cut through. A third incision is to be made to divide the psoas and iliacus internus muscles and the forepart of the capsular ligament, when

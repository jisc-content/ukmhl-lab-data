In a healthy constitution they are little dangerous, as the cellular tissue adheres over the apertures which have been made in them, and inflammation speedily closes them. I once saw the axillary vein wounded in removing a scirrhous gland from the axilla; a dossil of lint was placed in the wound, and the arm was confined to the side, when no bleeding of consequence ensued. In unhealthy constitutions they inflame and suppurate ; they also ulcerate, and sometimes life is destroyed, by bleeding or by the in- flammation extending to the large vein, and to the heart. Several cases of this kind I have witnessed; and in the greater number the wound of the vein had been made to abstract blood for inflammation of the lungs; and I have thought that the inflam- mation of the vein was the result of the impediment to the pulmo- nary circulation.

ON HYDROCELE. 239 the aneurismal bag be not very large, you may cut immediately across it; apply a piece of doubled lint, then adhesive plaster, and over the whole a roller. If the swelling is small, that is not larger than a walnut, adopt another mode, which is to make a circular incision completely down to the occipito-frontalis tendon. In this manner the connexion between the blood vessels and the aneurism is destroyed: and, by applying a dossil of lint and strips of adhesive plaster, you speedily succeed in getting rid of the disease. I saw a case of aneurism of the posterior aural artery, and for its cure, tied all the vessels which were leading to and from it. I should have done better, by making the circular incision, that I have just described, round the tumour. LECTURE XXIII. ON HYDROCELE. Hydrocele is an accumulation of water in the tunica vaginalis Definition, testis; the anatomy, therefore, of those persons who say that the fluid is contained between the tunica, albuginea and the tunica vaginalis is exceedingly faulty. Such a description is entirely false; and I scarcely need tell you, gentlemen, that the water is completely enclosed in the cavity of the tunica vaginalis. If the question were put to you, where is the water situated in hydrocele ? the answer would be what I have just stated; and if you gave any other, it would be directly perceived that your knowledge of the anatomy of the part was but imperfect. The situation of the water in hydrocele is precisely similar to Hydrops water in the pericardium; and what should we say of the man who Perecardu* would assert that this water was contained between the pericardium and heart ? Why, gentlemen, we should feel assured that he was entirely ignorant of the matter, for water in the pericardium is

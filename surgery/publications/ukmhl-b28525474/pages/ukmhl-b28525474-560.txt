444 Two kinds. Symptoms. LECTURE XXXVI. PARACENTESIS OF THE ABDOMEN. Dropsy of the abdomen is of two kinds : First, Peritoneal, or ascites ; Secondly, Encysted, or ovarian. OF ASCITES. The first symptoms of this disease is an unnatural sense of fulness in the abdomen after taking food, which renders it neces- sary to loosen the clothes; next, an increase of the lower part of the abdomen, observable at all times whilst the patient is in the sitting posture. When the patient lies down, the increase in the abdomen is general, and the enlargement is accompanied with an unusual tension; as if the abdomen were inflated In the sitting posture, a fluctuation can be perceived in the hypogastric and lower part of the umbilical regions, by placing the finger on one side and tapping on the other. In the recumbent posture, the intestines appear to undulate in the cavity, having more than their usual motion. As the disease increases, the swelling extends from the lower to the upper part of the abdomen, occupying the whole cavity. Little pain is felt, but considerable inconvenience arises from the distension, more particularly when the patient is in the recumbent position, on account of the action of the diaphragm being impeded. In proportion as the distension is greater, the fluctuation becomes distinct; and when the tension is extreme, the gentlest tap on the abdomen leads to a perception of the fluid. The secretion of urine is scanty. The enlargement of the abdomen is followed by swelling of the legs, either from the pressure of the fluid upon the veins returning the blood from the lower extremities, or from the general debility which accompanies this disease. I have known, when the omentum has been very considerably thickened, the perception of

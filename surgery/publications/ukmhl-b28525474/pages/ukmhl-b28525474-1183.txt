The first vertebra of the neck is united to the second by means Transverse, of a transverse ligament, which is also fixed to the first vertebra on each side, and passes behind the dentiform process of the second vertebra. The spinal column, from the two important purposes which it serves, namely, that of supporting the head and all that part of the body situated above the pelvis, and also from its containing and protecting the spinal marrow, upon which the volition and sensa- tion of the extremities depend, is, by the number of its bones, the strength of its joints, and its connection with the bones of the chest, most carefully protected from external injury. The effects w'hich are produced by violence done to the spinal Effects of in- cord are very similar to those which are produced by injuries to jmie5' the brain ;—for example :— Concussion. Extravasation. Fracture. Fracture with depression. Suppuration and ulceration. CONCUSSION OF THE SPINAL MARROW. When a person receives a very severe blow upon the spine, or, Concussion, from any great force, has it very suddenly bent, a paralysis of the parts beneath will frequently succeed, in a degree proportionable to the violence of the injury; but after such an effect, the person, in general, gradually recovers the motion and sensation of the parts.

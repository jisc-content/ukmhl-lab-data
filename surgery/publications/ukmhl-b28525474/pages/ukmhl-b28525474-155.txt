Some sores have their edges very much everted, and this affection With everted is commonly symptomatic of a cancerous diathesis; the usualedgeb' methods of treatment practised in these hospitals is to poultice such ulcers; to attend particularly to the condition of the general health, until the edges have resumed a natural and healthy state. The admirable mode recommended by Mr. Baynton, should be had recourse to, which, by approximating the sides of the wound, and thus facilitating the processes of granulation and cicatrization, will more surprisingly contribute towards the completion of the object we have in view. LECTURE XIV. ON GANGRENE. Having traced inflammation through its adhesive, suppurative, and Gangrene, ulcerative stages, I shall now proceed to consider it in its most destructive form, namely, when it exists in such excess as to pro- duce gangrene. We find that inflammation, when it is extremely active, occasions a destruction of vital power. At other times, when there is a less degree of inflammatory action, but where the powers of the part are feeble, the life of the part will also be destroyed ; so that gangrene is produced either by an excess of inflammatory action, where the powers are natural, or by a less degree of inflammatory action, where the powers of the part are feeble. Gangrene may be considered as a partial death. This is its D finition definition: the death of one part of the body, while the other parts are alive. The symptoms of gangrene differ according to the manner in which it is produced. When gangrene is the result of high and active inflammation, the pain attending its production is exceedingly Symptoms.

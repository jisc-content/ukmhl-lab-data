FRACTURES OF THE KNEE. .â€˜351 though a little smoothed. The upper portion of bone has its broken cancelli covered by a slight ossific deposit, so that there is more ossific action in the upper than in the lower portion of the bone, and certainly much less than in bones which do not form a part of the joints. The internal articular surface of the bone pre- serves its natural smoothness. Blood is immediately deposited in the place of the injured ligament; but this in a few days is ab- sorbed. Inflammation arises and pours out adhesive matter, which extends from one edge of the lacerated ligament to the other, and even between the bones, to each of which it is firmly united. Vessels shoot from the edges of the ligament and render the new substance organized, and produce a ligamentous structure similar to that from which the vessels shoot; this substance is not, however, always perfect, for I have seen apertures in it; but this will greatly depend upon the extent of the laceration of the ligament, and the too early use of the limb. In the dog and in the rabbit, or almost any other quadruped, it is possible by experiment to trace the mode of union of this bone. Experiment I. I drew the integuments much aside in a rabbit, and dividing them, placed a knife upon the patella and struck it lightly with a mallet; the bone was broken and directly drawn up by the action of the muscles. I let the integuments go, and the wound was not opposite the fracture. In forty-eight hours I killed the animal and examined the part. The bones were separated three quar- ters of an inch, and the intervening part filled with coagulated blood. Experiment II. I repeated the former experiment, and killed the animal on the eighth day, and found most of the blood absorbed, and adhesive matter occupying the space between the bones. Experiment III. The former experiment repeated; the animal examined on the

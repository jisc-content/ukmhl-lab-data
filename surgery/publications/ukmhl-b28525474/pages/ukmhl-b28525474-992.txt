Cause of the want of union. Want of proper apposition. 308 FRACTURES OF TIIE UPPER PART OF THE THIGH-BONE. and that I have not yet met with a single decisive example of it*. As a proof that the general principle which I have stated is correct, I subjoin the following account of forty-three cases, from different collections, of non-union by bone, in fractures of the neck of the thigh-bone. In the collection at St. Thomas’s . . 7 specimens, In the College of Surgeons . . 1 ditto. In St. Bartholomew’s .... . 6 ditto. At Dublin . 12 ditto. In Mr. Langstaff’s, of Basinghall-street . 6 ditto. In Mr. Bell’s and Mr. Shaw’s . 6 ditto. In Mr. Brookes’s .... . 2 ditto. In Dr. Monro’s ..... . 2 ditto. Mr. Mayo’s collection . 1 ditto. Total . 43 To these I have to add another, from an experiment upon a living animal; while, on the contrary, only a single instance meriting a moment’s attention has yet been produced: in this case, the same appearances were found in both the thigh-bones; and . even these resembled what I have several times observed in the dead body, arising from a softened state of the bones. I have given a plate of some of these appearances, and the preparations I shall at all times be happy to shew to any of my professional brethren who may wish to see them. Having thus explained the ordinary result of these cases, in re- lation to their want of union, I shall now proceed to state the reasons which may be assigned for the absence of ossific union in the transverse fracture of the neck of the thigh-bone within the capsular ligament. The first reason is the want of proper apposition of the bones : * In Mr. Cross’s account of his visit to the French hospitals, some interest- ing matter upon this subject will be found.

383 DISLOCATIONS OF THE ANCLE-JOINT. falling, overturned the cart, and threw Price’s legs under one of the shafts; in endeavouring to extricate himself he received a severe injury to the right ancle. By the direction of Mr. Parratt, he was immediately conveyed to St. Thomas’s Hospital, where I saw him; and on examination found that the tibia had been dis- located forwards and a little inwards, its inferior extremity resting on the fore part of the astragalus and os naviculare: the deltoid ligament must have been torn through, as the inner malleolus was not fractured. The heel projected very considerably, and the foot was turned outwards in a slight degree and downwards, the toes being pointed. The fibula was fractured about two inches above the external malleolus, at which part there was a considerable de- pression. The reduction was very easily accomplished by flexing the leg on the thigh, which was firmly held by my dresser, Mr. Campbell, as I drew the foot downwards and forwards, and pressed the tibia backwards. The limb was placed in the flexed position, on the heel; since which time the patient has been perfectly tran- quil, and the limb remains in its proper position. Experiment. I was anxious to ascertain what steps nature pursued in order to restore a part in which the extremity of a bone, forming a joint, had been sawn off; and I therefore instituted the following experi- ment. I made an incision upon the lower extremity of the tibia, at the inner ancle of a dog, and cutting the inner portion of the ligament of the ancle joint, I produced a compound dislocation of the bone inwards. I then sawed off the whole cartilaginous extremity ot the tibia, returned the bone upon the astragalus, closed the integu- ments by suture, and bandaged the limb to preserve the bone in this situation. Considerable inflammation and suppuration fol- lowed; and in a week the bandage was removed. When the wound had been for several weeks perfectly healed, I dissected the

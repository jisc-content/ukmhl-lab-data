PLATE XVI. 1. A dislocation of the ulna backwards. a, Os humeri. b, Ulna. c, Radius. d, Insertion of the biceps flexor cubiti into the tubercle of the radius. e, Olecranon thrown behind the os humeri. f, Some appearance of injury to the internal condyle of the os humeri. 2. Opposite view of the same preparation. a, Os humeri. b, Ulna. c, Radius. d, Insertion of the biceps into the tubercle of the radius. e, Olecranon thrown backwards. j\ Head of the radius, which, by its pressure against the ex- ternal condyle of the os humeri, has produced a socket there for itself. 3. Dislocation of the Radius. The bone is thrown upon the external condyle, and upon the coronoid process of the ulna. a, Os humeri. b, Ulna. c, Radius. d, Olecranon. e, Head of the radius. The coronary ligament and a part of the interosseous ligament is torn through, and the head of the bone is thrown upon the coronoid process of the ulna, and external condyle of the os humeri.

142 TREATMENT OF REDUCIBLE UMBILICAL HERNIA. In adults. In very fat per- sons. When very large. pass under the pelvis, between the thighs, to prevent the belt from slipping. For the adult, or even for children, when the hernia is of small size, a spring truss may be employed, made on the same principle as that directed for inguinal or femoral protrusions. The pad of the truss should cover the opening through which the viscera es- cape ; and the spring should pass from the pad to the back of the patient, a little beyond the spine ; and a strap should be continued from the spring to the pad, to complete the circle. When the patient is very corpulent, so that the navel is deep, the portion of ivory may be advantageously placed under the pad of the truss, the more effectually to close the opening of the sac; and this is much better than having a conical pad, which is liable to shift its position when the patient is in motion ; but the half globe of ivory does not follow the motions of the pad. Very large herniae, accompanied with a lax state of the abdo- minal parietes, require a different form of truss, as it is necessary to make a more extended pressure. The pad of the truss, there- fore, instead of being only of sufficient size to cover little more than the orifice of the sac, must be of considerable extent, so as to press upon a large space round the hernial opening, and thus support the parietes as well as the hernia, which will render the patient comfortable, although there is not any prospect of thus effecting a cure.

Simulates carotid aneu- rism. 204 ON aneurism of tiie aorta. him to examine the body of this person; we found a small pouch, just behind the sternum, proceeding- from the curvature of the aorta. It was of very great importance that a ligature had not been applied: the sac would have been cut through, and destruction of life taken place. The late Mr. Burns, of Glasgow, who was an excellent anatomist, and who published a capital work on the surgery of the head and neck, wrote to me to say that he had a case of aneurism above the clavicle, and entertained some thoughts of tying the subclavian artery for it, and asked me some questions relative to it, to which I returned an answer, and said to him, take care, do not deceive yourself, for what often appear to be aneurisms of the subclavian artery, are really aneurisms of the aorta. The operation was not performed. (It is mentioned in Mr. Burns’ work.) The patient afterwards died, and on examination it was found that it was an aneurism of the aorta; therefore I mention this to put you on your guard, for after what you have lately seen at Guy’s Hospital, don’t think the operation an easy one, and that it would add greatly to your credit to perform it. You might very easily mistake aneurism of the aorta for aneurism of the carotid or subclavian arteries. ANEURISM OF THE ANTERIA INNOMINATA. These cases in general do not allow of an operation being per- formed; there is no room for the ligature. Dr. Mott, of America, has put a ligature on this vessel; and for a time the patient appeared to be doing well; but he afterwards died. The operation did him much credit: few would have dared to perform it; and those who might have dared, probably would not have known how. Dr. Mott is an excellent anatomist, and an industrious man. ANEURISM OF THE DESCENDING AORTA. When the descending aorta is the subject of aneurism, in its course through the posterior mediastinum, it very often breaks into

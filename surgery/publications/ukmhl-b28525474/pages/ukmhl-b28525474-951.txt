PARTICULAR DISLOCATIONS. 271 John Lee, aged thirty-three, of a strong and robust constitution, Case, in passing over a foot-bridge, October 9th, 1819, fell from a height of about four feet on a large stone, and dislocated his left hip. I did not see him until the fourth of December, when I found the limb full three inches shorter than the other, the knee turned in, the foot directed over the opposite tarsus, and the trochanter major brought nearer the spinous process of the ilium. On laying the man on his face, the head of the femur and trochanter could be distinctly seen on the dorsum ilii, so as to leave not the slightest doubt of the nature of the injury. With the assistance of a neigh- bouring practitioner, I immediately set about to reduce it. A girth was applied between the legs, and a bandage over the knee, to fix the pulleys, &c., in the usual manner. I then made the ex- tension downwards and inwards, crossing the opposite thigh two- thirds downwards: and immediately when the extension was commenced, I gave him a solution of two grains of tartar emetic, which was repeated five times every ten minutes, but it produced eery slight nausea. I shortly after bled him to sixty ounces without syncope; and after keeping up the extension gra- dually for about two hours, with all the force one man could em- ploy with the pulleys, we found the limb as long as the opposite; we then endeavoured to lift the head of the bone over the acetabu- lum, by means of a towel under the thigh and over one of our heads, at the same time rotating the limb outwards with all the force we were able to exert; the foot at length became somewhat turned out, and the head of the bone to be less distinctly felt, and in about half an hour we heard a grating of the head of the bone, when the man instantly exclaimed it was replaced *; and, upon examination, finding the foot turned out, the limb of its natural length, and no appearance of the head of the bone on the dorsum ilii, we concluded it must be within the acetabulum, and desisted from any further violence, put the man to bed, and tied his legs • In dislocations which have long remained unreduced, the bones do not usually snap into the socket at its reduction.—A.

On examining the body after death, a portion of the ilium was discovered passing by the right side of the rectum to the ischiatic notch, through which a fold of the intestine was protruded into a small hernial sac, to the inner surface of which the intestine was adherent. The strangulated part of the gut, and about three inches of it on each side of the stricture, was very much disco- loured. The intestines between the stomach and protruded por- tion were distended with air, and had a few livid spots upon them. The intestines from the stricture to the rectum were very much contracted, particularly the arch of the colon. On carefully dissecting the parts after I had removed them from the body, I found a small orifice in the pelvis, anterior to, but a little above the sciatic nerve, and on the fore part of the pyriformis muscle. This opening led to the hernial sac, which was situated under the gluteus maximus muscle, and in which the intestine had j been strangulated. The orifice of this hernial sac was placed anterior to the internal iliac artery and vein, below the obturator artery, and above the obturator vein; its neck was seated before the sciatic nerve, and its fundus was covered by the gluteus maximus muscle. Below l the fundus was the sciatic nerve, and behind it the gluteal artery; above, it was placed near the bone. Should the existence of such a hernia be ascertained, it might, if reducible, be prevented from protruding by the application of a spring truss ; but should it become strangulated, and an opera- tion be deemed advisable, I should recommend the division of the stricture to be made directly forwards.

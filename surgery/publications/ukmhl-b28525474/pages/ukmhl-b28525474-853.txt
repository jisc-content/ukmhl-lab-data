OF PUNCTURED WOUNDS. These wounds are produced by pointed bodies, as needles, Danger of. scissors, hooks, points of broken bones, &c.; and the effects which follow them are often highly dangerous, by occasioning inflamma- tion of the absorbents ; or when tendinous structures or nerves are injured. OF THEIR EFFECTS UPON THE ABSORBENTS. A slight wound through the skin into the cellular tissue, will be sometimes followed by severe pain in the part, a blush around it, and by the absorbent vessels forming red lines, from the wound to the absorbent glands in which they terminate. Of this effect I have seen very many examples, and I have been Consequences, a sufferer from it myself. Abscesses sometimes form upon the absorbents, in their course to the axilla, or to the groin; and i sometimes in the glands in which they terminate; and in very irritable persons death sometimes ensues; and the following ex- ! ample of it I had an opportunity of inspecting. A West Indian, studying at Guyâ€™s Hospital, wounded his fin- Case, ger, the absorbents of his arm became inflamed, and he laboured under excessive irritative fever; the veins seemed to suffer also from inflammation communicated to them, for his limbs became almost incapable of motion, from the violent pain produced by bending any of the joints, and the superficial veins of his limbs were very tender when pressed. He died in six days after the attack, and I inspected his arm. The absorbents of the limb were highly inflamed; and in the axilla matter was effused, not in a separate abscess, but in a sheet of suppuration in the cellular tissue, between and around the absorbent vessels. I was not per- mitted to inspect the body further. vot. II. N

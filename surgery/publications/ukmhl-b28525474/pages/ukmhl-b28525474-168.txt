TREATMENT OF GANGRENE. 134 Hydraulic Power. First applied. To prevent Gangrene. thrown into one of very small diameter, the result is, an exceed- ingly great accumulation of force. Thus we see that piles which are driven into the beds of rivers, by the force of immense weights acting upon them, are raised by the admission of a very small quantity of water under them, upon the principles which I have just stated. Mr. Reedâ€™s syringe is formed upon this principle, and the valves are, besides, different from any which had been previously employed in similar instru- ments. With respect to the medical application of the syringe, how- ever, for the purpose of removing poisons from the stomach, we are indebted for it to Mr. Jukes, a surgeon at Pimlico, who published an account of it in the Medical and Physical Journal for November, 1822, p. 285; and a further account in the same journal for June, 1823. Mr. Jukes originally employed a gum- elastic bottle to be applied to the tube ; but the improvemnt of a syringe was suggested by Mr. Bush, of Frome. LECTURE XV. TREATMENT OF GANGRENE. In the last lecture we defined gangrene as a partial death; we described to you the symptoms which attended it, when it was the result of high and active inflammation, and when it was the result of a low degree of heat. We shall now proceed to consider the treatment which is usually employed to prevent gangrene, and to prevent the sloughing process. You must endeavour to soothe the parts by the applica- tion of leeches, with a view of checking the excess of action. It generally happens, in cases of gangrene, that the body will not bear any considerable degree of depletion; but local depletion, by

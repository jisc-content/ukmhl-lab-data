Umbilical hernia becomes irreducible from the same causes as Causes, the inguinal does; viz. adhesions of the intestines or omentum to the inner surface of the sac, or a growth of omentum, rendering it too bulky to repass the opening by which it escaped. Under these circumstances, the hernia sometimes acquires an Becomes very enormous size, more particularly in women whose abdominal pa- ldrge‘ rietes have been weakened by frequent pregnancy; and I have in such persons seen the pudendum entirely covered by the hernial swelling. The umbilicus in these cases is brought nearer to the pubes than natural, by the constant weight and drag of the hernia.

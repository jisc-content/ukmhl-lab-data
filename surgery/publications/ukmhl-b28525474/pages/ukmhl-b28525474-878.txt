202 WOUNDS OF THE STOMACH. Treatment. Rare. Dangerous. Mr. Scott’s case. for strangulated hernia ; in which case the intestine has been accus- tomed to violence. In the treatment of these wounds, it is best to make interrupted sutures; the needle should penetrate the skin and muscles, but not the peritoneum. If the muscle be not included in the ligature, a hernia is sure afterwards to form ; and if the thread is introduced through the peritoneum, it adds much to the danger of abdominal inflammation. Between the sutures, strips of plaister, or of lint dipped in blood, should be applied, and the patient should be freely bled from the arm. If the local inflammation be great, leeches should be em- ployed ; purgatives must be avoided, and food must not be given for several days. OF THE SECOND KIND OF WOUND OF THE ABDOMEN. Wounds of the abdomen, extending to the stomach, or intestines, are extremely rare. Their danger is much lessened, if the wounded portion of the viscus protrudes through the opening in the parietes; for, if not, they are generally fatal. WOUNDS OF THE STOMACH. The best case which I have heard of, is related by Mr. Scott, in the medical communications, from which the following account is taken:— “During the election for Weymouth, in March, 1784, Charles Thomas, a seaman, aged twenty-five, of a strong and healthy con- stitution, had the misfortune to receive a thrust with a small-sword on the left side of his body. The sword passed in between the second and third of the lower false ribs, and penetrated into the cavity of the abdomen in an horizontal direction, to the extent ol more than five inches, as appeared afterwards by the mark upor the blade. *

OF THE SPERMATIC VEINS. 280 but one divided into two, three, or more vessels, beside some small communicating branches. When examined below the external ring, they will be found as follows :— Three sets spring from the testis, one from the rete and tubuli, * and another from the vascular layer of the tunica albuginea, and a third from the lower extremity of the vas deferens. The veins of the testis pass in three courses into the beginning of the spermatic cord; two of these quit the back of the testis—one at its anterior and upper part, and a second at its centre; and these, f after passing from two or three inches, become united into one. , The other column accompanies the vas deferens. There is also a large vein just above the testis, which crosses to join the three columns. The veins of the epididymis are, one from the caput, another , from its body, one from its cauda, and another from its junction with the vas deferens, besides some small branches; they terminate in the veins of the spermatic cord. The veins of the cord below the external ring divide into numer- J ous branches, which are not only turned and twisted upon each i other, but very frequently communicate; so that, although they have valves, like other veins, they may be injected contrary to the ‘ course of the blood, by the injection traversing from one to the other. These vessels have been absurdly called the vasa pampyniformia. When we consider the length of the spermatic arteries and veins, and the numerous convolutions which they make, and remember that they are living tubes, whose directions are constantly changing, it must be obvious that nature has designed to make the circulation slow, the secretion elaborate, and that she has defended the tender structure of the testis from the danger of an impetuous current. This tardiness of circulation is further secured by the number and great size of the spermatic veins, when compared with their accompanying arteries.

INGUINAL HERNIA. 45 part of the rectus muscle. The external iliac artery and vein are directly behind this internal abdominal aperture, and this opening is the beginning of the inguinal canal, in which the spermatic cord is next continued. The inguinal canal is bounded anteriorly by a superficial fascia, Boundaries of from the abdominal muscles, and by the tendon of the external canal!8"'13' oblique; posteriorly, by the fascia transversalis, and by the tendon of the transversalis muscle; above, by the edges of the internal oblique and transversalis muscles, and below by Poupart’s ligament; the canal is about two inches in length, and terminates at the external abdominal ring. The external abdominal ring is formed by two columns of the External ring, tendon of the external oblique muscle united by fibres from Pou- part’s ligament; the upper column is inserted into the symphysis pubis, the lower column into the tuberosity of the pubes, the pubes bound the opening below; between these columns the spermatic cord passes; and from the edge of the ring, as well as from the surface of the tendon of the external oblique muscle, a thin fascia descends, uniting the cord to the edges of the opening, and passing down upon it to the tunica vaginalis ; this fascia is then situated between the skin and the cremaster muscle; which muscle arises within the inguinal canal from the internal oblique muscle; it descends with the spermatic cord, and passes through the external abdominal ring ; spreading over the fore and lateral parts of the cord as far as the tunica vaginalis, into which it is inserted. Behind the fascia and cremaster muscle the spermatic cord is Spermatic cord, found passing to the testis; it is covered by the tunica vaginalis, and is composed of the spermatic artery and vein, absorbents, and nerves, with the vas deferens and an artery accompanying it. The oblique inguinal hernia first enters the upper opening of the inguinal canal, or internal abdominal ring, so that at its com- mencement it is placed just mid-way between the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium and the symphysis pubis, and close above Poupart’s ligament; it has the spermatic cord behind it, and the epigastric artery to its inner side : when in the inguinal Origin and course of the hernia.

DISLOCATIONS OF THE CARPAL BONES. ■171 pressure upon the displaced part, the fracture was easily reduced. There was much extravasation and pain; six leeches were applied, afterwards evaporating lotions, and two long splints ; and as soon as the swelling had in some measure subsided, strips of soap plaster. At the end of six weeks the fracture was firmly united; but the motions of the wrist are still imperfect, and she cannot grasp any thing. Ganglia are sometimes mistaken for this accident; but in such cases a smart blow with a book will disperse the swelling, and dispel the cloud of doubt which enveloped the mind of the sur- geon. The os magnum and the cuneiform bones, from relaxation of Relaxation of their ligaments, are occasionally thrown somewhat out of their t,ie carl,ul j°mt- natural situation, so that when the hand is bent, they form protu- berances at the back of the wrist. This state is productive of so great a degree of weakness, as to render the hand useless unless the wrist be supported. I was consulted by a young lady, a patient of Mr. Cumming of Chelsea, who had such a projection of the os magnum, that she was, in consequence, obliged to give up her music and other ac- complishments, on account of the attendant weakness; for when she wished to use her hand, she was compelled to wear two short splints, which were adjusted to the wrist, and bound upon the back and fore part of the hand and fore arm. Another lady, who had a weakened state of limb, arising from a similar cause, wore, for the purpose of giving it strength, a strong bracelet of steel chain, clasped very tightly around the wrist. But the supports generally directed to be worn in these cases are straps of adhesive plaster, and a bandage over the wrist to confine and strengthen it. The effusion of cold water upon the hand from a considerable height is also employed, and the part is afterwards rubbed with a coarse towel, to give vigour to the cir- culation, and strength to the joints.

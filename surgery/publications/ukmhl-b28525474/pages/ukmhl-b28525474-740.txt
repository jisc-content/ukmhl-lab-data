88 OF THE OPERATION FOR Stricture in the inguinal canal. extremity for about a quarter of an inch, sharp for half an inch, and then again blunt, only cutting so far as is necessary to divide the stricture, without endangering the neighbouring parts. I have occasionally practised, and have for some time recom- mended in my lectures, the following mode of dividing the stric- ture without including the sac* The tendon of the external oblique having been divided a little above the external ring, the sac is gently drawn down, while the muscles are drawn up by an assistant. In this way the stricture is brought into view, and can be divided without risk, and without including the peritoneum. I was led to adopt this by the result of a case, in which I had reason to doubt whether the aperture in the intestine was not caused by the knife; when the stricture is not in view, the intestines cannot be completely secured from danger; the knife is passed blindly upon the finger as a guide, and in dividing the stricture has been known to wound the intestine. An advantage is derived from dilating the stricture without cutting the sac itself, for there is no danger of injuring the in- testine with the naked edge of the knife, which I have twice lyiown to happen when the stricture was divided from within the sac; in one case the patient died from the contents of the intestine escaping into the abdomen, in the other the intestine was obliged to be re- tained in the sac to allow of the escape of the faeces by the ex- ternal wound. An additional advantage is derived from this method of dilatation, viz. that if by any mistake of the operator the epigastric artery is cut, as the peritoneum is undivided, the flow of blood would be immediately perceived, and then the vessel might be secured; whereas if the sac is included in the incision, the artery would bleed into the abdomen, and the consequences might be fatal, without the cause being known but by dis- section. The second seat of stricture is in the inguinal canal, and is formed by the sac itself in the following way:â€”a person becomes the subject of oblique inguinal hernia, and the pressure on the neck of the hernial sac at the internal ring, creates a thickening of

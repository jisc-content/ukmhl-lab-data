OF FEMORAL HERNIA. 41 tissue, which serves to unite the fascia transversalis, where it de- scends to form the anterior part of the femoral sheath, with Pou- | part’s ligament itself. This structure has been much noticed of late, because from its position, stretching across the upper and fore part of the femoral sheath, it must in many cases, doubt- less, assist in forming the stricture, when the hernia becomes strangulated. From the preceding account, it will be perceived that the only Course of place at which the viscera can escape from the abdomen into the femoral hernia- thigh, is at the crural ring. The hernia passing through that aperture enters the inner or wide part of the crural sheath, and descends beneath Poupart’s ligament and the superior extremity of the falciform process, as far as the saphenous opening of the fascia lata. In this situation the hernia bulges forwards, passes through that aperture, and thus reaches the hollow placed at the upper and inner part of the groin; and if the protrusion acquires any considerable bulk, it then turns upwards and rather out- wards over Poupart’s ligament, so that the external swelling in these cases is situated in some degree on the lower part of the abdomen. The peculiar course of the femoral hernia is deter- mined by the anatomical connexions already pointed out; thus, when the tumour has reached the saphenous opening, it neces- sarily passes forwards through it: first, because the inner wall of the femoral sheath, which above is separated from the vein, in this situation becomes closely applied to that vessel, and thus op- poses the further descent of the hernia; and, secondly, because at the saphenous foramen there is less resistance than elsewhere. The ascent of the hernia towards Poupart’s ligament is principally owing to the resistance of the superficial blood-vessels of the groin. If we wished, for the sake of illustration, to institute a com- parison between the anatomy of inguinal and femoral hernia, we should say, that the crural ring, at which the protrusion first quits the abdomen, corresponds to the internal abdominal ring ;—the short passage beneath Poupart’s ligament, and the falciform pro-

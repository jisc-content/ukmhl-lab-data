ON DISLOCATIONS. Definition. Necessity of prompt assist- ance. Instances of mistake. DISLOCATIONS IN GENERAL. A dislocation is a displacement of the articulatory portion of a bone from the surface on which it was naturally received. Of the various accidents which happen to the body there are few which require more prompt assistance, or which more directly en- danger the reputation of a surgeon, than cases of luxation. If much time shall have elapsed before the attempt at reduction is made, the difficulty of accomplishing it is proportionably in- creased, and not unfrequently becomes insuperable : and if the nature of the injury be unknown, and the luxation consequently be left unreduced, the patient will remain a living memorial of the surgeon’s ignorance or inattention. “ What is the matter with me ?” said a patient who came to my house, placing himself be- fore me and directing my attention to his shoulder : “ Why, Sir, your arm is dislocated.”—“ Do you say so ! Mr. told me it was not out.”—“How long has it been dislocated?”—“Many weeks,” he replied.—“ Oh, then you had better not have any attempt at reduction made.”—He said, “ Well, I will take care that Mr. has no more bones to set; for I will expose his igno- rance in that part of the country in which I live.” He was a man of malevolent disposition, and carried his threat into execution, to the great injury of the surgeon, who was also frequently reminded of his want of skill, by meeting his former patient in his rounds; and what was worse, by hearing the following observation fre- quently repeated: “ Mr. is a good apothecary, but he knows nothing of surgery.” i K 21 ill 1 k Sil ■ i If in " 'i :

TREATMENT OF THE REDUCIBLE FEMORAL HERNIA. 129 TREATMENT OF THE REDUCIBLE FEMORAL HERNIA. From the small size of the opening through which femoral hernia passes, the patient is in great clanger from strangulation, unless proper means be adopted to prevent the descent of the viscera. The employment of a truss is the only method by which the safety of a patient can be secured; but the truss required for femoral hernia must be of somewhat different construction to that which is required in inguinal hernia. The pad, instead of being continued nearly in a straight direc- tion with respect to the spring, as when required for inguinal hernia, should project downwards, nearly at right angles, to the spring, that it may effectually press upon the opening through which the hernia protrudes under Poupart’s ligament, and also upon the upper part of the thigh. The truss should be constantly worn, as for inguinal hernia, to prevent the protrusion of the hernia, and also with the view of ob- literating the mouth of the sac, and curing the disease. It is very rare, however, that a cure is effected in femoral hernia by means of the truss, but still it is right that it should be con- stantly kept on. I have known many instances in which the con- stant application of the truss has not produced the smallest apparent alteration in this hernia ; the reason is, because Poupart’s ligament, and the fascia lata, support the pressure of the truss, and the con- stant variation in the tension of these parts on every movement of the body, prevents the steady pressure necessary to produce a gra- dual closure of the opening. In some cases, when the opening of the femoral sheath is large, it will be necessary to have a larger pad and a stronger spring to the truss, and the pad may be more effectually kept in place, by means of a strap passed from it round the upper part of the Danger of strangulation.

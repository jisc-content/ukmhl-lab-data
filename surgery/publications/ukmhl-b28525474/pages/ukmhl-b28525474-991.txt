FRACTURES OK THE UPPER PART OF TIIE THIGH-BONE. ,‘507 to learn, but also to abandon those false impressions which hypo- thesis is sure to create. Nothing is known in our profession by guess; and 1 do not believe, that from the first dawn of medical science to the present moment, a single correct idea has ever emanated from conjecture. It is right, therefore, that those who are studying their profession, should be aware that there is no short road to knowledge; that observations on the dis- eased living, examinations of the dead, and experiments upon living animals, are the only sources of true knowledge; and that inductions from these are the sole basis of legitimate theory. In all the examinations which I have made of transverse frac- tures of the cervix femoris entirely within the capsular ligament, 1 have never met with one in which a bony union had taken place, or which did not admit of a motion of one bone upon the other. To deny the possibility of this union, and to maintain that no ex- ception to the general rule can take place, would be presumptuous; especially when we consider the varieties of direction in which a fracture may occur, and the degree of violence by which it may have been produced: as for example, when the fracture is through the head of the bone*, and there is no separation of the fractured ends; or, when the bone is broken without its periosteum being I torn; or, when it is broken obliquely, partly within and partly ex- ternally to the capsular ligament: but I wish to be understood to say, that if ever it does happen, it is of extremely rare occurrence, * Some pains have been taken to impress the public mind with the idea, that I have in this work denied the possibility of union of the fracture of the neck of the thigh-bone ; and therefore I beg at once to be understood, that I believe the reason why fractures of the neck of the thigh-bone do not unite is, that the ligamentous sheath and periosteum of the neck of the bone is torn through; and that there is, in consequence of this circumstance, a want of nourishment of the head of the bone. But if a fracture should happen without the reflected ligament being torn, I can readily believe that as the nutrition would continue, the bone might unite. But the character of the accident would differ: the nature of the injury could scarcely be discerned, and the patient’s bone would unite with little attention on the part of the stirgeon.

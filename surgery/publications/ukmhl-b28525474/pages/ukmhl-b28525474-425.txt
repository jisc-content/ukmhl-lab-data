315 OK THE TREATMENT OF THIS DISEASE. “ I consider my symptoms might have originated in an injury I received upon the cord, some time before the symptoms began.” Master H. aged 14, has a~teazing and aching pain in the testis. Case* 1 Exertion brings on the pain; leaning forward increases it. He cannot walk one hundred yards but he has pain in the groins, loins, thigh, and leg, to the foot, on that side; the testicle is tender to the touch. The recumbent posture relieves him, unless he has catarrh, and then he has the pain even in bed. DISSECTION. I have removed the morbid part in three instances; and I thought, in the first case, the centre of the epididymis was diminished, and that the disease might be produced by an accumulation of semen behind it, and that the obstruction might produce the pain; but I am inclined to believe that the disease is in the nerve, as in the other two cases there was no marked disorganization. It seems to me to be a species of tic douloureux, supported by the . constant functional changes to which the part is liable; for if it arose from organic change, it would not, as it does, cease for a considerable time, and then relapse. OF THE TREATMENT OF THIS DISEASE. The remedies I have seen most useful have been small doses of Medicines, the oxymurias hydrargyri with the compound decoction of sarsa- parilla, given twice per diem, and continued for a length of time. The application of a belladonna plaster to the part, and opening a blister at the groin, and dressing it with ung: cetacei et opii. A Change of sea voyage to a warm climate, I have known improve the patient, climate’ from the rest and change of constitution it has produced. It will be right to try arsenic, which has considerable power over tic douloureux; to give Quinine, as bark relieves it; also to try steel, as it has been recommended by Mr. Hutchinson, of Southwell; but at the same time to deplete the part by leeches, and lessen the nervous Local bleeding.

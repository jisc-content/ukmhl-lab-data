426 Two states. Of the external Internal. Occasion pro- lapsus ani. OF PILES OR HEMORRHOIDS. These are found in two states, viz. a varicose enlargement of a vein; or an excrescence arising from its adhesion and organization. The first is external or internal. The symptoms of the first are an external swelling, which feels round and hard, which is painful at the passage of the stools: is hot and itches at other times. It sometimes bursts, and discharges blood with the stools. In a few days it declines and disappears. Sometimes it becomes inflamed, and very acutely painful; and it now and then suppurates, and lays the foundation of fistula. If cut into before suppuration, a large and very solid clot of blood passes from it. Repeated returns of this complaint engender an excrescence, which arises from the swelling having undergone adhesion, and become organized, forming a cutaneous tumour which is very vascular. The skin over it is thin,â€”the substance very irritable, and pains shoot from it into the rectum to a considerable height from the anus. I have known a person confined to her bed from the excoriation and suffering produced by such excrescences originating in external piles. The internal piles are originally enlarged veins: they produce pain about the sacrum, bleed frequently, and render the passage of the motions difficult; and the stools are often mixed with blood. At length many of these become obliterated by adhesion, and form very vascular pendulous tumours in the entrance of the rectum. They often occasion prolapsus ani; the patient feels as if there was more motion to discharge, and he forces the rectum until a part of it becomes everted, and the internal piles appear externally, thus producing prolapsus ani. The patient, after each evacuation, is obliged to return these with the finger; the evacuation is in consequence highly painful, tedious, and very often the return of the part is exceedingly difficult.

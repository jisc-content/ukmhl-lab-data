335 SCIRRHOUS TUBERCLE, OR CANCER. Anxiety of mind, tending to the presence of slow fever and sup- Influence of pressed secretions, are the predisposing causes of the complaint. A predisposing mother watching with anxiety a near and dear relative in sickness; t0 scirrhus. deprived of her natural rest, and inattentive to the deviation from health in her own person, is often afterwards affected with this disease. A person, the prey of disappointment from reduced circum- stances, and struggling against poverty, when her prospects begin to brighten, finds a malignant tumour in her breast; costive state of bowels, a dry skin, a paucity of other secretions have attended this anxious state of mind, and laid the foundation of that destruc- tion which awaits her. In the examination of persons who have died from this disease, | besides the affection of the neighbouring glands, scirrhous tubercles are found in many other parts of the body, but more particularly in the thoracic and abdominal viscera. j In addition to the scirrhous deposit in the sternum of Mrs. Edge Case, i (already mentioned,) scirrhous tubercles were found in the following , situations: In the integument covering each breast; in the glandular struc- ture of the breast itself, and in the neighbouring absorbent glands; also in the substance of the pectoral and intercostal muscles. Thorax—On the pleura of each side, and on the pericardium, the cavities of which contained water; also in the substance of each lung. Abdomen—In the liver, pancreas, mesenteric glands, and uterus. In the dissection of another patient, who died with an ulcerated case cancer on the right breast, scirrhous tubercles had formed in the direction of the internal mammary artery on each side, but more particularly on the right; also in the intercostal muscles. The surface of each pleura, and the substance of each lung, exhibited numerous similar tumours. The bronchial glands were also enlarged i from the same cause.

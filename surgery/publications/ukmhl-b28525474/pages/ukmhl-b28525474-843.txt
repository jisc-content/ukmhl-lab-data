INTESTINE WITHIN THE ABDOMEN. 167 i previously very healthy and active. The case terminated fatally, two days after the commencement of the symptoms; and on ex- amination after death, the intestine was found in a gangrenous state. A case in which a portion of small intestine had protruded Case, through an opening in the mesentery, and become strangulated, occurred under the care of Mr. Palmer, of Hereford, The symptoms were severe, but the patient survived until the ninth day from their commencement. Dr. Monro has related a case of this nature in his work on crural hernia. Mr. Hodson, of Lewes, attended a young man who died in con- Case, sequence of the strangulation of a fold of small intestine, which had protruded through an aperture left in an adhesion of the omentum to the peritoneum. I have a very excellent specimen, showing the strangulation of Case, intestine by elongated membranous bands. It was taken from the body of a patient of Mr. Weston’s, of Shoreditch. The patient was eighty-five years of age, and resided in Hoxton Workhouse. He was seized with symptoms of strangulated hernia, in con- sequence of which Mr. Weston was sent for, who, on examining the man, found a hernia on the right side, which he soon reduced by the taxis. The symptoms, however, continued, and the patient died. On examining his body after death, I found that the in- testine had been returned into the cavity of the abdomen, but that two folds of it were entangled and strangulated by a long mem- branous band. In the Museum at Guy’s Hospital is a beautiful preparation, Specimen in showing a considerable portion of the small intestine, surrounded GuysMuseum and strangulated by the appendix vermiformis ; but I am not ac- quainted with the history of the patient from whom it was taken. As the precise nature of any of the above cases could not be ascertained during the lives of the patients, no benefit could be de- rived from surgical aid.

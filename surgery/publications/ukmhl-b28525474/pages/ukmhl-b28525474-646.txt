PLATE I., CONTINUED. /, Is the saphaena major vein of the leg going through the fascia to enter the femoral vein. 7ii, Another part of the same fascia, which arises from Pou- part’s ligament, and joins with the fascia lata, which it assists in forming. 71, The tendon of the external oblique muscle cut open to shew the parts which are situated behind it. o, The internal oblique muscle; its lower edge, which arises from Poupart’s ligament, is raised and turned to shew the parts behind it. It is inserted into the pubes behind the upper column of tendon which forms the abdominal ring. /;, The transversalis muscle. Its lower edge also arises from Poupart’s ligament, but is here raised and turned up. In its natural state it runs over the cord to be inserted into the pubes behind the abdominal ring, which it serves as a valve to close posteriorly. q, A fascia, connected with Poupart’s ligament, which runs up- wards to the transversalis, and unites itself to the posterior part of the transverse muscle and its tendon, and thus prevents the bowels from slipping between the lower edge of the muscle and Poupart’s ligament, or between the fibres of the muscle itself. That portion of the fascia which is placed between the spinous process of the ilium at b, and the hole r, is strong; but that between the hole r, and the pubes, is often little more than condensed cellular membrane, as that part is strength- ened by the tendon of the transversalis, and by the epi- gastric artery. A portion of the fascia is fixed in the pubes, and another part of it passes behind Poupart’s ligament to unite with the femoral vessels. r, The place at which the spermatic cord goes into the abdo- men. The fascia situated on its outer side and lower part, is of considerable density, but becoming thin upon its inner

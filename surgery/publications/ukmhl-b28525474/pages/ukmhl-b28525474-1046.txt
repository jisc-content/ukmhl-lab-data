35S FRACTURES OF THE KNEE. in our power must be used for that purpose. I know well that Case. Treatment. From violence or ulceration. from the separation produced in the bone; but if that cannot separate, and its parts remain in contact, ossific union may he produced. In the summer of 1819, Mr. Marryat was thrown from his gig as he was passing along the Strand; by the fall he fractured his patella transversely and the lower portion of the bone was also broken perpendicularly, so that it was divided into three pieces. The transverse fracture united, as usual, by ligament; but the perpendicular by bone. Mr. Parrott of Tooting, who also attended the case, writes in these words: “ Dear Sir,—I have great pleasure in replying to your letter. The longitudinal fracture of the patella of Mr. M. has become very 1 firmly consolidated; but there is a line or ridge to be traced upon the surface of the bone, which marks distinctly the place where it had been separated.” , In the longitudinal or perpendicular fracture of the patella, the J°P best treatment consists in extending the leg, and in using local depletion and evaporating lotions: in a few days a roller should be applied around the limb, and then a laced knee-cap, with j a strap to buckle around the knee above and below the patella, ' and a pad on each side to bring its parts as nearly as possible into contact. 1 COMPOUND FRACTURE OF THE PATELLA. These fractures occur from injury, or from an ulcerative process If* under peculiar circumstances. If the laceration be extensive, or the contusion very consider- able in these cases, amputation will be required ; but if the wound be small, and the patient be not irritable, and no sloughing of the integuments or ligament be likely to occur from the nature of the accident, it will be best to try to save the limb. The prin- cipal object is, to produce adhesion immediately ; and every means 1

1G6 OF STRANGULATION OF THE Appearances. Dr. Jones’s case. Causes. Case. The abdomen having been opened, and the omentum and large intestines turned up, a tumour was discovered on the left side of the cavity, extending from over the left kidney, to the edge of the pelvic cavity, the lower portion being situated in the fold of the sigmoid flexure of the colon. The large intestines took their usual course, only that the coecum was nearer to the centre than in common. On the left side, the colon was raised by the tumour. The duodenum, a small part of the jejunum, and termination of the ilium, were the only parts of the small intestines to be seen, on first opening the abdomen, all the rest being situated in the sac, i, having protruded by an aperture on its right side, which was large „ enough to admit two folds of intestine in a distended state. The sac was formed by the peritoneal layers of the mesocolon. Dr. Jones, of Barbadoes, sent me a drawing, exhibiting the larger part of the moveable viscera, between the layers of the peritoneum, as found when examining the body of a patient he had attended. OF STRANGULATION OF THE INTESTINE WITHIN THE ABDOMEN. This I have known to occur in several different ways. First.—From the intestine protruding through an aperture in the omentum, mesentery, or mesocolon. ft Second.—From the same circumstance occurring when small openings are left in the adhesions formed in consequence of in- flammation. I Third.—From a membranous band formed at the mouth of a hernial sac, becoming elongated, and entangling the intestine when it has been returned from the hernial sac. Fourth.—From the appendix vermiformis entangling the in- testine. Mr. R. Croakes, surgeon, of Barnsley, in Yorkshire, sent me ' the account of a case in which a portion of intestine had been pro- truded through an opening in the omentum, and had become strangulated. The patient was eighty years of age, and had beer |

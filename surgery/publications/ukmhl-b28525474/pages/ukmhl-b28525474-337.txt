279 OF THE SPERMATIC VEINS. When the artery reaches from one to three inches from the epi- didymis, varying in different subjects, it divides into two branches, which descend to the testicle on its inner side, opposite to that on which the epididymis is placed; one passing on the anterior and upper, the other to the posterior and lower part of the testis. From the anterior branch, the vessels of the epididymis arise: First, one passes to its caput; secondly, another to its body; and, thirdly, one to its cauda and the first convolutions of the vas deferens, communicating freely with the deferential artery. The spermatic arteries, after giving off branches to the epididymis, enter the testis, by penetrating the outer layer of the tunica albu- ginea; and dividing upon its vascular layer, they form an arch by their junction at the lower part of the testis, from which numerous vessels pass upwards; and then descending, they supply the lobes of the tubuli seminiferi. Beside this lower arch, there is another passing in the direction of the Rete, extremely convoluted in its course, and forming an anastomosis between the principal branches. OF THE SPERMATIC VEINS. There are two veins at their terminations in the abdomen; for Spermatic they may be said to begin at the extremities of the arteries in the vtims' testis, and to terminate in the abdomen. On the right side, the spermatic vein ends in the inferior cava, nearly opposite to the origin of the spermatic artery; and on the left side, in the renal or emulgent vein. They enter the abdomen at the internal ring, and pass in contact with the arteries, near to the kidneys, before they quit them to terminate in the manner which I have stated. Two or three veins often accompany each spermatic artery in the abdomen; and similar branches also cross upon the coats of the artery, and form several anastomoses; but they unite into one before they terminate. In the inguinal canal they are placed with the spermatic artery;

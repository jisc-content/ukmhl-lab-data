Before I proceed to mention these, I will give you a brief account of the nervous system; a correct knowledge of which, however, can only be acquired by assiduity in the dissecting room. The nervous system is composed of the following parts, viz. brain (which is divided into cerebrum, cerebellum, and medulla oblongata), medulla spinalis, and two sets of nerves—one set issuing from the brain, and the other from the medulla spinalis. Beside these, there is also the grand sympathetic nerve, which may be said to form a system in itself, it communicates with most of the nerves of the brain, and with those of the spinal marrow; it forms by its branches a large ganglion, or several ganglia, called the semilunar, situated behind the stomach, and a plexus proceeds from this, which distributes branches to the greater part of the abdominal viscera. The nerves are freely distributed to every part of the human frame, and are the means by which all voluntary and involuntary motions are maintained. It is impossible that a mere description of the nervous system, in this place, however minute it might be, could make you sufficiently acquainted with its anatomy; for this can only be obtained by the most careful and attentive examination of the dead body. It is necessary, however, for you, at this moment, to bear in mind, that an immediate communication exists between the stomach and brain, by means of the eighth pair of nerves, or par vagum; for unless you do this, it is probable that an important symptom, which 1 shall presently mention, attendant on injuries of * If no vesication have taken place, I have always found a strong solution of nitrate of silver, applied as a lotion, then powdered with flour, a most effectual remedy.—L.

X s' WOUNDS OF PARTICULAR ARTERIES. 191 light bandage to stop the haemorrhage. Great tumefaction suc- ceeded about the shoulder, gangrene began in the arm, great constitutional irritation followed, and the man died. Upon exami- lation of the body after death, it was found that after the fracture jf the clavicle, the scapula was forcibly drawn back, so that the subclavian artery was torn through, but a cord of cellular mem- crane united its ends, so that the extravasation of blood had been yery slight. AXILLARY. ! Mr. Key operated, and tied the subclavian artery, on account pf an aneurism of the axillary artery, which had been produced by |i forcible extension of a dislocated os humeri. BRACHIAL ARTERY. This artery I have often known wounded in bleeding. A slight bandage, and a thick dossil of lint as a compress, have succeeded in healing the artery. If aneurism forms, the tourniquet should be employed, as I lave described ; and if this does not succeed, apply a ligature ipon the brachial artery. Make an incision in the middle of the arm, on the inner side of the biceps, and take care to exclude the !/ein and median nerve from the ligature. ULNAR ARTERY. The wounds of this artery are usually at the lower part of the ore arm, where the vessel is situated, between the tendons of the jlexor carpi ulnaris, and the flexor profundus; it is accompanied iy the cubital nerve, which is placed close to the artery, and .vhich must be carefully excluded from the ligatures. On account if the free anastomosis between this artery and the radial, the application of two ligatures, one above, and another below the opening into the vessel, is absolutely necessary to effectually stop he haemorrhage.

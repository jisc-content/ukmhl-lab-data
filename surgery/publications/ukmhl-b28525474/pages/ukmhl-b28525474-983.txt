FRACTURES OF THE UPPER PART OF THE THIGH-BONE. 299 bone ; for, whilst there are received into the hospitals of Guy’s and St. Thomas’s, (containing about nine hundred persons,) not more upon an average than two such dislocations in a year, the w’ards are seldom without an example of fracture of the upper part of the thigh-bone. DIFFERENT SPECIES OF FRACTURE OF THE UPPER PART OF THE THIGH-BONE. The different species of fracture of the upper part of the thigh- bone, as already observed, are three in number. First: That in which the fracture happens through the neck of the bone entirely within the capsular ligament. Secondly : A fracture external to the ligament, through the neck of the thigh-bone at its junction with the trochanter major; by which the trochanter is split, and the neck of the thigh-bone is re- ceived into its cancelli. Thirdly: A fracture through the trochanter major, beyond its junction with the cervix femoris. FRACTURES OF THE NECK OF THE THIGH-BONE, WITHIN THE CAPSULAR LIGAMENT. The appearances which are produced by this fracture are as fol- low :—The leg becomes from one to two inches shorter than the other ; for the connection of the trochanter major with the head of the bone, by means of the cervix, being destroyed by the frac- ture, the trochanter is drawn up by the muscles as high as the ligament will permit, and consequently rests upon the edge of the I acetabulum, and upon the ilium above it. The difference in the ! length of the limbs is best observed by desiring the patient to place himself in the recumbent posture on his back, when, by comparing i the malleoli, it will be generally found that one leg is shorter than \ the other. The usual state of the limb is, that the heel on the in- jured side rests in the hollow between the malleolus interims and tendo achillis of the other leg ; but there is some variety in this respect; a fork is sometimes formed in the trochanter minor, which Appearance.

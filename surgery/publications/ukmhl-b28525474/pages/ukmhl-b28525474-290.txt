252 ON THE CURE OF HYDROCELE. Theoperations The operation by incision. absorption in the parts, and what we do to facilitate the operation of these remedies, is, to have a bag or suspensory truss to hold the scrotum, and this is fastened by two tapes round the abdomen, just below the umbilicus, and kept constantly wet with those fluids, in order to stimulate the absorbents; therefore be on your guard about performing an operation for hydrocele in young persons, as the cure can be effected by absorption alone; there are a few exceptions, however, to this rule, but they are exceedingly rare, as in almost every case of hydrocele in young persons or children, the water will be absorbed. With respect to the adhesion of the tunica vaginalis in the cure of hydrocele, this is effected in three ways, by injection, seton, or incision; but the use of injection does not always produce adhesion of the tunica vaginalis ; here is a specimen (pointing to one on the table) which was taken from a captain of a ship one morning, on whom I performed the operation for hydrocele by injection, by which he was relieved of every symptom of the complaint; several years after this he was taken extremely ill, and I was consulted by his attendant surgeon; he was dying of some organic affection; I desired the surgeon to remove the testicle and tunica vaginalis frorti the side on which the operation had been performed, as soon as the patient was dead, which was done; on examination it was found that the tunica vaginalis did not adhere completely, there were'a few adhesions in some parts but not generally; the injection did not produce adhesion, but a new series of actions was set up, a deposit was secreted, and the ends of the arteries were sealed, so that any further secretion was prevented. The process of granulation is set up when an incision is made in the scrotum, and extraneous bodies introduced, but this requires considerable caution ; some surgeons use one mode of cure, some another; various are the operations which have been proposed, but most have now yielded to that of injection. In the operation by incision you divide the scrotum and tunica vaginalis, on the front part, so as to allow the water to escape, but it was soon found that this was not sufficient to effect a cure, and it was then recommended,

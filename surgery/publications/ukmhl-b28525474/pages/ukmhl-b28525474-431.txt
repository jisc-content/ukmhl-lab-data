321 DISSECTION. organ are of the hydatid kind. I have twice seen swellings not of this description, rather than the hydatid; but generally the largest I in the breast are of this kind. One, which I removed, with Mr. Cline, from Lady Hewett, weighed nine pounds. From Mrs. King, at Charing Cross, I removed one which | weighed thirteen pounds ; but frequently they are removed when still small, under a supposition that they are scirrhous tubercles. These swellings are pendulous, and the whole breast is very moveable even when large ; they are generally unattended with pain, although to this rule there are exceptions, and the constitu- tion is but little disordered. The absorbent glands, â€˜in the most aggravated form of this complaint, are undiseased, so that it does not extend by absorption. Inflammation sometimes takes place in one of the cysts ; and, inflammation when the cyst ulcerates, serum mixed with mucus, and occasionally ofthecysts- with a little matter, is discharged; the wound then heals, and the cavity seems obliterated ; but the disease again ulcerates in other parts, and passes through the same process. It is a complaint I have seen at all ages after twenty, but more frequently in advanced age than in youth. DISSECTION. Upon dissection, the breast is found to be consolidated by the adhesive inflammation, so as to form a very firm swelling in some parts, but in others it contains cysts distended with serum. The cysts vary in size; some of them contain mucus mixed with pus. The cysts which I have seen in the breasts have been of three kinds. First, the globular hydatid, like that which is found in the i liver, contained within a vascular cyst. A second species, com- i posed of numerous membranes, which may be peeled from each other, like the concentric lamellae of the crystalline humour. But i tumours of the breast are sometimes composed of simple bags, which | contain and secrete the serum, or watery fluid, within them. Y

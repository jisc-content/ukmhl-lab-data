DISLOCATIONS OF TIIE CLAVICLE. 405 in part rounded, and in part depressed; and both are covered by an articular cartilage similar to that of the other joints. A cap- Cartilage, sular ligament proceeds from the end of the clavicle to the edge of the articulating surfaces of the sternum, and it is strengthened by short ligaments, which pass directly from one bone to the other. Within the capsular ligament is situated the inter-articular cartilage, joined at the upper part of the joint to the clavicle, and to the capsular ligament; and, below, to the edge of the articular surface of the sternum, and to the capsular ligament; it is inclined under the end of the clavicle with the capsular ligament, so that the clavicle rests upon its surface, and it is also interposed between that bone and the sternum. Of that portion of this cartilage which is inclined to the clavicle, only about one half is smooth, to allow of the motion of that bone, and this is its lower and anterior part. The residue of it adheres to the articular cartilage of the clavicle, forming a flat, rough surface; but on the side towards the sternum, the inter-articular cartilage forms a smooth and concave surface, which allows of its free motion on that bone. The inter-articular cartilage is placed not perpendicularly, but obliquely; its upper end is inclined inwards, and its lower end outwards, towards the first rib. From the upper point of the clavicle proceeds an inter-clavicular ligament, which adheres to Inter-clavicular the capsular ligament, and slightly to the sternum ; and traversing 1|gament- the upper and back part of the sternum, it is fixed in the extremity of the opposite clavicle, and unites very strongly one clavicle to the other. The clavicle is also joined to the first rib by a clavicular-costal, Clavicular-cos- or as it is called, rhomboid ligament, which proceeds from the ta' â€™'g31116111- inferior edge of the sternal end of the clavicle to the cartilage of the first rib. The motion of the clavicle, as well as that of the sternum, Motion of the forwards and backwards, is performed upon the smooth surface L'J'lcle' of the inter-articular cartilage, which is applied to the sternum; whilst the motion of the clavicle, upwards and downwards, is *

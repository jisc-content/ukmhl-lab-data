DISLOCATIONS or THE wrist-joint. 4GG Symptoms. Diagnostic marks. Mode of re. duction. Case. DISLOCATION OF THE ULNA. As this bone does not form a part of the wrist-joint, but is re- ceived into a capsular ligament of its own, and is separated from the wrist by a moveable cartilage, it is more frequently dislocated, separately, than the radius. When this accident occurs, the sacciform ligament is torn through, and the bone generally projects backwards, without any accompany- ing fracture of the radius. It rises and forms a protuberance at the back of the wrist; and although it is easily pressed down into its natural position, yet so soon as the pressure is removed the de- formity returns, as the lacerated ligament has no longer the power to retain it in its place. The diagnostic marks of the injury are, the projection of the ulna much above the level of the os cuneiforme, and altered position of the styloid process, which is no longer in a line with the metacarpal bone of the little finger. The reduction is accomplished by pressure of the bone forwards, which brings the ulna into its natural articular cavity by the side of the radius; and to retain it in this situation, splints must be placed along the fore arm, in a line with the back and palm of the hand; the splints should be padded throughout; but upon the ex- tremity of the ulna a compress of leather should be placed, to keep it in a line with the radius; a roller should then be applied over the splints to confine them with sufficient firmness. COMPOUND DISLOCATION OF THE WRIST, ULNA PROJECTED, AND FRACTURE OF THE RADIUS. John Winter fell from a ladder on his hand and knee; the hand was bent back, and the ulna protruded at the inner part of the wrist. Mr. Steel, of Berkhampstead, attended; the bone was re- duced, a roller was put around the wrist, and the wound healed very soon by adhesion. In seven weeks he was well, excepting that a slight swelling of the tendons remained for a few weeks longer.

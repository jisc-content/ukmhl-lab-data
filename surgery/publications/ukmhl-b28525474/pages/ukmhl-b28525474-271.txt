ON THE TYING OF ARTERIES. 257 account of a case, in which an operation had been performed for this disease, and it proved fatal. When the accident has recently occurred, it may be cured by the Treatment, following plan.

This then is the part where the vessel may be most easily and safely tied. In aneurism of the ulnar arteiy, situated at the wrist, it is right to open the sac, to tie the artery above and below the opening, taking care to exclude the ulnar nerve, which closely accompanies the artery. TYING THE RADIAL ARTERY. In aneurisms of the radial artery at the wrist, which are frequently

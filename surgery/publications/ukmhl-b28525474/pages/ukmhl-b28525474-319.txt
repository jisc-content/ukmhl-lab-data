PLATE III.—ANATOMY. Fig. 1. Shows the external portion of the tunica albuginea cut open, and turned aside to show the internal vascular layer, with the spermatic artery taking its tortuous course upon it. With care, this layer may be entirely dissected from the thicker tendinous coat. ff, spermatic cord. b b, external portion of the tunica albuginea cut open. c, the internal vascular layer. Fig. 2. Minute injection of the spermatic artery; yet the vessel is filled with a coarse injection. «, the spermatic artery sending branches to the cord. b, arteries of the epididymis. c c c, spermatic artery in the testis, displaying its arches below, and its inverted branches first ascending and then descending. d, another, and superior arch in the mediastinum. e, artery accompanying the vas deferens, arising from a vesical artery of the hypogastric. Fig. 3. Shows the deferential artery. a, the testis. b b, vas deferens. c, spermatic artery. d d, the deferential artery anastomosing with the spermatic. Fig. 4. 'Perpendicular and longitudinal section of the testis. a a, mediastinum testis. b b, the lobules of the tubuli attached to the mediastinum, and proceeding to the tunica albuginea, on which the vascular enveloping membrane appears.

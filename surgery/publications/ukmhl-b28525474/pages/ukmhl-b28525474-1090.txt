398 DISLOCATION OF THE TARSAL BONES. from the hospital in five weeks, having the complete use of his foot. DISLOCATION OF THE OS CUNEIFORME INTERNUM. I have twice seen this bone dislocated: once in a gentleman who called upon me some weeks after the accident, and a second time in a case which occurred in Guy’s Hospital. In both these instances the same appearances presented themselves. There was a great projection of the bone inwards, and some degree of eleva- tion, from its being drawn up by the action of the tibialis anticus muscle ; and it no longer remained in a direct line with the metatarsal bone of the great toe. In neither case was the bone reduced. The subject of the first of these accidents walked with but little halting, and I believe would in time recover the use of the foot, so as not to appear lame. The cause of the accident was a fall from a considerable height, by which the ligament was ruptured which connects this bone with the os cuneiforme medium, and with the os naviculare. The second case, which was in Guy’s Hospital, my apprentice Mr. Babington, informed me, happened by the fall of a horse through ; which the foot was caught between the horse and the curb-stone. The treatment of this injury will consist in confining the bone in its place by at first binding it with a roller dipped in spirits of wine and water, with which it must be constantly kept wet: when the inflammation is subdued, a leathern strap is to be buckled around the foot, to keep the bone in its place till the ligament be united. The metatarsal bones I have never known luxated : their union with each other, and their irregular connexion with the tarsus, prevent it; luxation, therefore, must be a very rare occurrence. DISLOCATION OF THE TOES FROM THE METATARSAL BONES. This is a very uncommon accident: but I had a man under my

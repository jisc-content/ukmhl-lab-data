FRACTURES OF T1IE UPPER PART OF THE THIGII-BONE. 311 i bones to press upon eaeli other, and thus support the necessary in- flammation for the production of ossific union. When a fracture occurs amidst muscles, those which are inserted into the fractured j part of the bone, have generally a tendency to keep the ex- tremities of the bones together, with some few exceptions ; but when a fracture occurs in the neck of the thigh-bone, the mus- cles have only an influence upon one portion of the fractured bone; and this influence serves to draw one part from the other. But the third and principal reason which may be assigned for tbe want of union in this fracture is, the almost entire absence of ossific action in the head of the thigh-bone when separated from its cervix ; its life being supported by the ligamentum teres, which has only a few minute vessels, ramifying from it to the head of the bone. The structure of the neck of the thigh-bone, and of the parts surrounding it, is explained in the account of the anatomical plate connected with this part of my subject. But here it may be observed, that the neck and head of the thigh-bone are naturally supplied with blood by the periosteum of the cervix, and that when the bone is fractured, if, as most frequently happens, the periosteum be torn through, the means of ossific action are, in consequence of such fracture and laceration, necessarily de- stroyed in the head of the bone. Scarcely any change, therefore, takes place in the head or neck of the bone attached to it; no de- posit of cartilage or bone, similar to that of the other fractured bones, is produced; but the deposit which does take place, as will be seen in the plates of fracture of the neck of the thigh-bone, consists of ligamentous matter, covering tbe surface of the can- cellated structure with little patches like ivory on the head of the bone*. * But if I attempt to prevent union in a fracture external to a joint, I find, liv moving tbe bone from time to time, that in proportion to that motion is tbe quantity of callus produced; which is just the reverse in the accidents I am now describing. Little action in the head of the bone.

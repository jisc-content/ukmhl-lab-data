397 DISLOCATION OF THE TARSAL BONES. In the case, of which an account was sent me by Dr. Lynn, Case, of Bury St. Edmunds, it will be seen that the discharge of the , astragalus, in a compound dislocation of the ancle-joint, did not prevent the patient’s recovery; for he says, “ In five weeks a portion of the astragalus separated, and another piece a week afterwards, which, when joined, formed the ball of that bone.” Mr. Tyre, of Gloucester, had also under his care a case of Case, compound luxation of the astragalus, in which he cut out the luxated bone, and the patient had a good recovery, with a tolerably useful foot. DISLOCATION OF THE OS CALCIS AND ASTRAGALUS. The five anterior bones of the tarsus are sometimes dislocated from the os calcis and astragalus. There is a joint placed trans- versely between the os calcis and astragalus, and the os naviculare and os cuboides ; and this joint is sometimes, but rarely, luxated by very heavy weights falling upon the foot, of which the following is an example. SIMPLE DISLOCATION. A man working at the Southwark Bridge, had the misfor- Case, tune to have a stone of great weight glide gradually on his foot: he was almost immediately brought to Guy’s Hospital, and the following were the appearances of the limb. The os calcis and the astragalus remained in their natural situations, but the fore part of the foot was turned inwards upon the bones. When examined by the students, the appearance was so precisely like that of a club foot, that they could not at first believe that it was not a natural defect of that kind : but upon the assurance of the man, that previously to the accident his foot was not distorted, an extension was made by fixing the leg and the heel; the fore part of the foot was then drawn outwards, and thus the reduction was effected.

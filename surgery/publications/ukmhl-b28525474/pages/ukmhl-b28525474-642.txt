8 ANATOMY OK HERNIA. External oblique. a very uncommon variety of the disease. The hernia cystica is described as being equally destitute of this membranous coat; but this is only true in the commencement of the disease. Dr. Marshall has a preparation of umbilical hernia in which no sac appears, but the protruded parts lie in direct contact with the skin. This variety is very rare ; but the possibility of such an occurrence should be known, as in performing the operation for hernia extreme care should on this account be taken, to avoid wounding any of the protruded viscera. LECTURE XL. ANATOMY OK THE PARTS FORMING INGUINAL AND FEMORAL HERNIA. Five pairs of muscles with their tendons form the principal cover- ing of the abdomen. These are, on each side, the obliquus exter- nus, the obliquus internus, the transversalis, the rectus, and the pyramidalis. The three first of these only, however, are concerned in the production and course of the two kinds of herniae in ques- tion. The external oblique muscles, arising from the eight inferior ribs on each side, slope with an easy descent towards the lower part of the abdomen, and end in an expanded tendon, which covers the whole of the hypogastric and part of the umbilical re- gions. This tendinous expansion is provided in man to defend him from the accidents to which his erect attitude would naturally subject him. In quadrupeds, to whom the horizontal position is natural, the weight and pressure of the viscera are diffused over the whole of the abdominal parietes ; but in the human subject, when die abdominal muscles and diaphragm are combining their powerful efforts to fix the ribs, to enable the muscles of the upper extremity to act to the greatest advantage, the viscera being forced towards the lower part of the belly, muscular fibre would prove but a

30 DISSECTION OF THE Internal ring. the muscles, lines the whole interior wall of the abdomen; it is named the fascia transversalis. We shall in this place merely consider the relations of the fas- cia transversalis with the parts of inguinal hernia; deferring its connections with the fascia iliaca and crural sheath, till the anato- my of femoral hernia is described. The fascia transversalis is attached to the wdiole length of Poupart’s ligament, that is to say, from the anterior superior spine of the ilium, as far as the tuber- cle of the pubis. It then passes upwards, beneath the transverse muscle, over the peritoneum, as far as the cartilage of the ribs, thus covering the whole anterior wall of the abdomen ; but being i much stronger below, where the greatest support is required, than ; above, where, indeed, it degenerates into cellular tissue, but still preserving the form of a membrane, it may by care be dissected s from the peritoneum as a separate and distinct layer, as high j nearly as the diaphragm. ; i At the distance of nearly an inch from the crural arch, it will ii be observed that the spermatic cord is connected with the fascia; a this connexion, which is very intimate, has been variously de- 1 scribed by writers. Sir A. Cooper, who first discovered this fas- ii cia as a separate part of the abdominal parietes, has, in his splen- » did plates, represented it as consisting of two portions—an outer ll or iliac portion, and an inner or pubic; between these two parts k an elliptical shaped opening being left, called the internal abdomi- ii nal ring. A careful examination will show, however, that there !o is no actual opening or perforation of the fascia transversalis at the internal ring; on the contrary, it is evident that at the point Ii where the spermatic cord quits the abdominal cavity to pass It through the parietes, it carries with it a tube-like process of the ill fascia, which process, wide above and becoming contracted below, so as closely to embrace the cord, extends with that structure into i the scrotum; and there, again enlarging, it completely invests it that covering of the testicle which is called tunica vaginalis re- it flexa. What, then, is known as the internal ring, is in fact >1

Mode of re- duction. ^Diagnostic mark of the 452 FRACTURES OF THE ELBOW-JOINT. secting the ligaments, the coronary ligament was found to be torn through at its fore part, and the oblique also had given way. The capsular ligament was partially torn, and the head of the radius would have receded much more, had it not been supported by the fascia which extends over the muscles of the fore arm. Of the causes of this accident I know nothing, never having seen it in the living subject. As to its reduction, it will be easily effected by bending the arm; but to secure the bone from subsequent displacement, the arm must be kept steadily bent at right angles, and secured by splints and a circular bandage in that situation, until the union of the coronary ligament has been effected; which will require the lapse of three or four weeks from the accident. LATERAL DISLOCATION OF THE RADIUS. Mr. Freeman, surgeon, of Spring-gardens, brought to my house a gentleman of the name of Whaley, aged twenty-five years, whose pony having run away with him, when he was twelve years of age, he had struck his elbow against a tree whilst his arm was bent and advanced before his head. The olecranon was broken, and the radius dislocated upwards and outwards, above the external con- dyle ; and when the arm is bent, the head of the radius passes the os humeri. He has a useful motion of the arm, but neither the flexion nor the extension is complete. FRACTURES OF THE ELBOW-JOINT. FRACTURES ABOVE THE CONDYLES OF THE OS HUMERI. The condyles of the os humeri are sometimes obliquely broken off just above the joint, and the appearance produced is so similar to that of the dislocation of the radius and ulna back- wards, that this fracture is very liable to be mistaken for that injury. The appearances of this accident, as will be seen, are like those

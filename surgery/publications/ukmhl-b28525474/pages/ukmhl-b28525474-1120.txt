424 DISLOCATIONS OK THE OS HUMERI. Application of the bandage. strongly fixed in its new situation, more force is required, and the following means should be employed. The patient must be placed upon a chair, and the scapula fixed by means of a bandage, which allows the arm to pass through it; that which we use at our hospital is a girth buckled on the top of the acromion, so as to raise the bandage high in the axilla, and thus enable it more completely to fix the scapula, which is the principal object to be attended to, as otherwise all efforts will be inefficient. When I first saw the mode of reduction practised thirty-eight years ago, a round towel was used instead of this bandage, which was placed in the axilla, and crossed the chest; but it appeared to me that by this means the lower angle of the scapula alone was fixed, and that the glenoid cavity was drawn with the arm when extension was made: I directed, therefore, that the towel should he tied over the oppo- site shoulder with a handkerchief, so that it should be raised in the axilla on the injured side, and thus embrace a larger surface of the scapula; but still I found the scapula drawn from the side with the arm, and therefore had the bandage made as described. A wet roller is next to be bound around the upper arm just above the elbow, from which situation it cannot slip; and upon this a very strong worsted tape is to he fastened, in a manner to be de- scribed when speaking of the reduction of dislocated fingers. The arm should then be raised at right angles with the body, and if there be much difficulty in the reduction, it should be elevated above the horizontal line, more completely to relax the deltoid and supra-spinatus muscles. Two persons should then draw from the bandage affixed to the arm, and two from the scapular bandage, with a steady, equal, and combined force; jerking should be entirely avoided, and every aim at quick reduction should be dis- countenanced : slowly and steadily should be the word of command from the surgeon ; who, after the extension has been kept up for a few minutes, should place his knee in the axilla, resting his foot on the chair upon which the patient sits; he should then raise his knee by extending his foot, and placing his right hand upon the acromion, push it downwards and inwards, when the head of the

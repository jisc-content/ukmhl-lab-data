OF AMPUTATION OF THE LEG BELOW THE KNEE. 484 A single Hap may be made. Instrument. Position. Operation. Vessels. Not a suc- cessful operation. Various modes of operating. Sometimes a single flap may be made from the dorsum, or sole of the foot, but it does not unite so readily as the double flap. OF AMPUTATION THROUGH THE TARSUS. A catling only is necessary in performing this operation. The tourniquet must be applied, and the patient placed as in the former case. In this operation, the navicular bone is to be separated from the astragalus, and the os cuboides from the calcis. The surgeon, having felt for the projecting point of the navicular bone on the inner side of the foot, cuts through the integument about three-quarters of an inch beyond it, straight across the dorsum of the foot, and having made two small lateral incisions, he dissects back the upper flap, and divides the extensor tendons over the articulations, which he then opens, first, by cutting through the lateral ligaments on the inner side, uniting the navicular bone to the astragalus, then the ligament on the dorsum connecting the same bones, and afterwards the ligaments between the os cuboides and calcis, above and externally; the knife being then passed down between the articulations, the inferior ligaments with the flexor tendons and muscles in the sole are divided, and the operation concluded by making an inferior flap of the integument equal to the superior. The same arteries require to be secured as after the former operation, and the dressing and after position of the patient are to be similar. From a comparative result of this operation, with that of sawing through the tarsal bones, I am certain the latter produces less irritation and danger than the former. OF AMPUTATION OF THE LEG BELOW KNEE. This operation may be performed with a circular incision, and with a single or double flap. I prefer the first, but cases may

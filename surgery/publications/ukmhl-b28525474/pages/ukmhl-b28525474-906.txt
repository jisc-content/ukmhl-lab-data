WOUNDS OF TENDONS. 230 Cause of. tendon soon unites by the adhesive process, and the use of the limb is afterwards gradually restored. Some degree of thickening of the tendon for a long time remains, and the patient halts a little in rapid motion. The position of the foot and leg is to be maintained in the same way as when the tendon is divided by incision, and an evaporating lotion should be employed. After the union, the same precautions are to be observed with respect to the employment of the high- heeled shoe. OF PARTIAL LACERATION OF THE TENDO ACHILLIS AND GASTROCNEMIUS MUSCLE. A person in running or walking fast, or if his foot slips back- wards when it has been advanced, sometimes feels as if he had received a severe blow upon the back of his leg, and is immediately unable to walk but with the greatest difficulty, and with the foot extended. The cause of this feeling is a laceration of some fibres of the tendo achillis, or of the gastrocnemius muscle, where it joins the tendon. There is great tenderness upon pressure on the follow- ing day, with some ecchymosis, which daily increases, until the limb becomes considerably discoloured. The least attempt to bend the foot is accompanied with great pain, and followed by swelling of the leg and ancle. From a belief that the injury is slight, and from negligence in treating it, the lameness which results from this accident is often of very long continuance ; but, if properly attended to from the first, it is in general soon recovered from. A similar treatment to that recommended for division or lacera- tion of the tendon, is requisite for the cure of this injury, and when the patient can bend the foot without producing pain, then the high-heeled shoe must be worn, and the heel be gradually lowered, as in the previous cases. From three to six weeks are required to effect a cure.

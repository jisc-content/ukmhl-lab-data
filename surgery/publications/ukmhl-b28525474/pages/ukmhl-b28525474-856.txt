The inflammation from punctures of the hand in dissecting, will continue a long time, and be resumed when it seems to be at an end; attention to the general health, and to the part, must be therefore regarded closely, for a considerable period after the in- jury* OF PUNCTURED WOUNDS OF TENDINOUS STRUCTURE. If fascia be punctured, alarming symptoms will sometimes arise, in part from the form of the wound, from the feeble power of the structure, and partly from the confinement of matter beneath the fascia. The form of the wound produces these symptoms, because the parts are rather forcibly separated than actually divided, and con- sequently the adhesive process does not readily succeed. The structure of tendons and fasciae, from their little vascular organiz- ation, and difficult restoration, leads to much constitutional effort; and the form of fascia tends to confine the pus when it is secreted. A gentleman sat upon a rail, from which a nail projected, and it entered the middle and back part of his thigh ; great irritative fever followed, with redness and swelling of the thigh; and, as fomentations and poultices, and calomel with opium, did not re- lieve him, I made an incision in the situation of the puncture, and found that the nail had penetrated the fascia lata; I divided it freely, when some pus, which had formed under it, was discharged. He quickly recovered. When a puncture is made into a theca, suppuration is apt to en- sue, when an early incision, by allowing the discharge of the mat- ter, prevents the greatest mischiefs. If matter forms under the aponeurosis of the palm of the hand, an early incision is the only mode of relief, if the puncture which

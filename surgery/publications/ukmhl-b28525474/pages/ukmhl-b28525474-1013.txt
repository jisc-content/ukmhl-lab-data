FRACTURES OF THE UPPER PART OF THE THIGH-BONE. 329 roller around the foot of the injured leg, and by binding the feet and ancles firmly together, so as to prevent their retraction, and thus cause the uninjured side to serve as the splint to that which is fractured, giving it a continued support. A broad leathern strap should also be buckled around the pelvis, including the trochanter major, to press the fractured portions of the bone firmly together ; and the best position for the limb is, to keep it in a straight line with the body. The following plan I have also known successful:—The patient being placed on a mattress on his back, the thigh is to be brought over a double inclined plane composed of three boards, one below, which is to reach from the tuberosity of the ischium to the pa- tient’s heel, and the two others having a joint in the middle by which the knee may be raised or depressed; a few holes should be made in the board, admitting a peg, which prevents any change in the elevation of the limb but that which the surgeon directs ; over these a pillow must be thrown, to place the patient in as easy a po- sition as possible*. When the limb has been thus extended, a long splint is placed upon the outer side of the thigh to reach above the trochanter major, and the upper part of this is fixed to a strong leathern strap, which buckles around the pelvis, so as to press one portion of bone upon the other; and the lower part of the splint is fixed with a strap around the knee, to prevent its position from being altered; the limb must be kept as steady as possible for many weeks, and the patient may be permitted to rise from his bed when the attempt does not give him much pain: he is still to retain the strap which I have mentioned round the pelvis; and by this treat- Recovery, ment he will ultimately recover, with a useful, though shortened limb. * The construction of this inclined plane is so little complicated, that it may be made at the instant, of two common boards, one of which is to be sawn through nearly at the middle, and if hinges cannot be immediately procured, the boards may be nailed together thus

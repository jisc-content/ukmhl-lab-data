These injuries differ from the incised and lacerated wounds, in being accompanied with disorganization: blood is extravasated, â€¢ the cellular tissue is broken down, muscles are bruised, and many parts disorganized. The process of restoration is therefore quite different to that which takes place after incised or lacerated wounds. Inflammation to a considerable extent must be produced ; the dead parts must be separated by a process of ulceration, and . granulations will arise to fill up the cavities occasioned by these separations. The surgeon, therefore, who treats these wounds as he would the incised or lacerated, has still to learn the fundamental principles of his profession. Contused wounds bleed but little, from the organization of the parts being destroyed, and from the extravasation making pressure upon the vessels which are divided. The treatment of the contused wround in principle consists in facilitating the separation of the contused parts, instead of ap- proximation, as in the incised and lacerated wounds. To effect this object, and to expedite the process, fomentations and poultices are to be used, which lessen inflammation when too violent, and hasten the suppurative and ulcerative processes. If the inflammation be still considerable, leeches should be applied; but bleeding ought not to be had recourse to from the arm, for all the powers of the constitution are required to assist in the process of separation and of granulation. The bowels should be kept regular; but opium should be com- bined with the medicines given, to effect that object. If the con- stitution become much debilitated, the sulphate of quinine may be given ; or ammonia, combined with opium. When the sloughing, or separating process is completed, the

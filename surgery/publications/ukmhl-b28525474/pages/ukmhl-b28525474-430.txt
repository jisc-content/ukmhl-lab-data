320 OF THE HYDATID OR ENCYSTED TUMOUR. Symptoms. Becomes in part fluid. LECTURE XXVIII. ON DISEASES OF THE BREAST. The diseases of this organ have been too much considered as being j of a malignant nature; and females who have had the misfortune to have tumours in their bosoms, have been often very unnecessa- rily submitted to an operation, under the idea of the complaint being cancerous. I shall therefore proceed to state what I have been able to learn of the various diseases of this organ, to discri- minate the malignant from the more benign complaints, and to point out the cases which really require removal, in distinction from those in which operations are entirely unnecessary.

This disease begins in a swelling, which is unattended with pain, and which has the character rather of a chronic inflammation, in a part of the breast, than as bearing a resemblance to a scirr- hous tubercle; for it has neither its mobility, its excessive hard- ness, nor its general circumscribed or distinct limits, hut it incorpo- rates itself with the surrounding parts of the breast. The skin over the mammary gland is undiscoloured, and the part is scarcely tender to pressure. The general health is unaltered, even when the swelling becomes of the most formidable magnitude.

If this part be punctured, a liquid, having the usual character of serum, is discharged; the cyst sinks, but soon becomes again distended, and the swelling continues to grow. At length, the tumour acquires enormous magnitude, and some of the largest swellings in this

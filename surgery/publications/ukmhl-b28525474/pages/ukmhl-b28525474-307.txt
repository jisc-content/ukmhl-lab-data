265 TUNICA VAGINALIS. abdominal ring, and from thence descends upon the spermatic cord to the lower part of the testis. It is internally attached to the cremaster muscle and its tendon; externally to the cellular tissue of the scrotum. It forms a purse, to support the testicle when the scrotum is relaxed ; it attaches the testicle to the scrotum by sending to it a reticular membrane, and it envelopes and connects the superficial vessels and nerves with the spermatic cord. CREMASTER MUSCLE. This muscle next appears in the course of the dissection, enveloping Cremaster, the spermatic cord, covering it entirely, and inserted into the tunica vaginalis; but as the cremaster belongs to the cord as well as to the testis, I will proceed with the dissection of the testis, and afterwards describe the cremaster. TUNICA VAGINALIS. This membrane, when first raised, is found to be covered entirely Tunica by the tendon of the cremaster muscle, which envelopes its outer Vae1I,all!‚Äù surface, and is inserted into it; and until this be cut through, the true tunica vaginalis does not appear. When the insertion of the cremaster muscle is cut away, the tunica vaginalis is found to be a very delicate and thin membrane, formed from the peritoneum, and descending from the abdomen before the testis. It is composed of two portions : the one loose and detached from the testis, excepting posteriorly and laterally; the other, which adheres to the surface of the tunica albuginea, and which covered the testis whilst in the abdomen; but when examined in the scrotum, the two portions are connected, and are continuations of each other. The first, or loose portion, is the tunica vaginalis reflexa, and the Tunica vagi- adhering portion the tunica vaginalis testis : between the first and nalls reflexa' second there is a cavity, into which a vapour, or halitus, is naturally

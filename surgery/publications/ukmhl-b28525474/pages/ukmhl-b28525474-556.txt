OF FUNGOID POLYPUS OF THE RECTUM. 440 Case. Case. Case. Case. without putting a thread around it. Whilst at Lecture 1 was sent for to attend the child on account of haemorrhage, and I begged Mr. H. Cline to visit the patient for me; but he soon returned and informed me, that the bleeding had been of little consequence, and had stopped spontaneously. The child recovered. In a stone patient of Mr. Gaitskellâ€™s, upon whom I was operating, the child having prolapsus ani, I saw a small excrescence, red and pendulous, growing upon the mucous membrane of the intestine, which I thought was the commencement of one of these diseases.

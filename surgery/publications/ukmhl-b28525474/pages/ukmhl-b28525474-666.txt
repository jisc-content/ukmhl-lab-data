DISSECTION OF THE 26 and the thigh is marked out by the depression which corresponds to Poupart’s ligament, (the crural arch,) which structure may be readily traced in its whole extent between the anterior spine of the ilium and the tubercle of the pubis. In order to expose the structures more immediately con- nected with inguinal hernia, it is necessary to make a perpendi- cular incision commencing at the umbilicus and terminating at the symphysis pubis; from the upper end of this incision a second may be carried outward to the crest of the ilium, and in this manner a triangular flap will be marked out which should be carefully raised, recollecting, that, in the first instance, the skin only should be taken up, leaving the superficial fascia perfect and entire. Having thus exposed the fascia superficialis abdominis, the manner in which that important structure strengthens the lower wall of the abdomen should be observed. In common with all other parts of the body, it covers the whole surface of the ab- domen ; it is continued over Poupart’s ligament into the groin, and an important process descends into the scrotum, covering the spermatic cord, and at length proceeding perfectly continuous with the superficial fascia of the perinaeum. The superficial fascia being provided to afford an uniform support in all parts of the body, is endowed with the necessary degree of strength and elasticity ; but its thickness and resistance are much greater where it covers the abdomen and thigh than elsewhere. In those situations it is particularly necessary to remark, that it presents a laminated texture, so that, by proceeding carefully, se- veral successive layers may be raised and divided. In this stage of the dissection the variable thickness of the fascia as to the quantity of fat contained in its substance, and its degree of resist- ance in different subjects, should be noticed. The superficial blood-vessels of the abdominal parietes are lodged in the substance of the fascia; they consist of the superficial circumflex of the ilium, the superficial epigastric, and the external pudic arteries. The student will observe that some of these vessels, especially the latter, are so placed with respect to the external ring, and the

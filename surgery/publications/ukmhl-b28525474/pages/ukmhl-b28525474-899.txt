In a patient of mine in Guyâ€™s Hospital, the wound upon the Case, thyroid cartilage remained fistulous, and I raised a piece of skin from the surface of the neck, above the opening, and turned it over the opening, the edges of which I had previously pared; it united extremely well.

The trachea is here on the fore part, the oesophagus behind, and the carotid ar- teries are situated close to the trachea, more especially the right. | The thyroid gland crosses the upper part of the trachea, and its i veins cover the fore part. If the trachea be cut, the air rushes through the wound both in Symptoms, i expiration and inspiration. The blood gets into the trachea, and i excites a violent coughing, by which a bloody froth is forcibly i ejected, but the food or liquids do not pass out through the aperture. The external opening, in these cases, is generally small, as the wound often arises from a stab, and the consequence is, that the blood does not freely escape, but lodging in the bronchia, adds excessively to the dyspnea. In the treatment, the first object is to stop the bleeding; and if Treatment, the wound be not sufficiently large to lead to the easy discovery of the source of the haemorrhage, an incision should be made, in a longitudinal direction, to expose the mouths of the vessels.

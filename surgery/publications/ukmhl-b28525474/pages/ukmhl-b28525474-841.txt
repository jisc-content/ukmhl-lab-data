OF THE MESENTERIC HERNIA. OF THE MESOCOLIC HERNIA. 165 tenth rib. The other viscera of the abdomen were otherwise but little altered; but near a quart of bloody serum was extravasated into the cavities of the chest and abdomen. OF THE MESENTERIC HERNIA. ■ This hernia occurs in consequence of a natural deficiency of one of the layers composing the mesentery, or from an accidental aperture being made. The intestines force themselves into such an opening, and, quitting the proper cavity of the peritoneum, form a hernia, which may become of very large size, as the cellular union of the two layers is not sufficiently firm to offer much resistance to the pres- sure of the protruding viscera. Mr. Pugh, of Gracechurch Street, afforded me an opportunity of examining a hernia of this kind. The subject in which it was found, had been brought for dissection to St. Thomas's Hospital; and the man had been a patient under Mr. Forster, in Guy’s Hos- pital, just previous to his death. On opening the abdomen, and raising the omentum and colon, the small intestines were not to be seen, but a large swelling was (discovered, situated over the lumbar vertebrae, and reaching to the basis of the sacrum; which, on further examination, proved to be a sac of peritoneum, containing the small intestines, and surround- ing them completely, excepting at the posterior part, where the aperture by which the intestines had escaped, was situated. From what I could collect of the previous history of the pa- tient, he did not appear to have been much inconvenienced by this unnatural position of the viscera. OF THE MESOCOLIC HERNIA. Cause. Formation. Case. Appearances. The formation of this hernia is similar to that last described; and the first example I had an opportunity of examining, was, as 1 the former, in a subject brought to the Hospital for dissection.

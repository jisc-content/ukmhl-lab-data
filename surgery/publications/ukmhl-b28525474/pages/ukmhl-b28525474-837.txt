1G1 OF THE PHRENIC HERNIA. I VOE. II. M 1 quently from the usual symptoms of hernia, and is in danger of being destroyed by a strangulation of the protruded parts as in I other herniae. In the year 1798, I published the history of an interesting case , of this description, which I shall take the liberty of relating â€¢ here. Sarah Homan, aet. twenty-eight, had, from her childhood, been Case, afflicted with oppression in breathing. As she advanced in years, the least hurry in exercise, or exertion of strength, produced pain in her left side, a frequent cough, and very laborious respira- tion. These symptoms were unaccompanied with any other marks of disease; and, as her appetite was good, she grew fat, and, to com- mon observation, appeared healthy. The family with whom she lived suspected her of indolence, and her complaints being con- sidered as a pretext for the non-performance of her duty, she was forced to undertake employments of the most laborious kind. This treatment she supported with patience, though often ready to sink under its consequences. After any great exertion, she was frequently attacked with pain in the upper part of the abdomen, with vomiting, and a sensation, as she expressed it, of something dragging to the right side; which sensation she always referred to the region of the stomach. The cessation of these symptoms used to be sudden, as their ac- cession. After suffering severely for a short time, all the pain and sickness ceased, and allowed her to resume her usual employ- ments. As her age increased, she became more liable to a repetition of these attacks; and, as they were also of longer continuance than in the early part of life, she was at length rendered incapable of labouring for her support. Some days previous to her death, she was seized with the usual ;symptoms of strangulated hernia; viz. frequent vomitings, cos- tiveness, and pain: the pain was confined to the upper part of the labdomen, which was tense and sore when pressed.

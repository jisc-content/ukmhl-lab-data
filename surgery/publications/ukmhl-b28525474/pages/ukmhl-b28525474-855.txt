OF PUNCTURED WOUNDS. 179 peculiar inflammation, or the production of the first stage of putre- faction. I have known the bites of cats, dogs, and rats followed by high Sites of dogs inflammation, and constitutional irritation, many days after the am'CatS" injury has been inflicted; and these cases unite the symptoms of punctured and contused wounds ; the first effects upon the con- stitution arise from the punctures of their pointed teeth; but when the symptoms produced from this cause subside, from fifteen to twenty days after, I have known the injured parts inflame and slough; the constitution, as well as the part, undergoes great i changes, and the patient becomes excessively reduced.

If the finger is wounded, a piece of string or tape should be bound tightly round the injured finger, from its junction with the hand, as far as the wound, so as to force out blood from the opening. Third.—The nitric acid, nitrate of silver, or caustic of potash, should be applied to the wound. Fourth.—A lotion composed of the subacetate of lead ; spirits of wine and water should be applied over the part, to prevent too much action when inflammation begins. Fifth.—Leeches should be applied, and fomentations with poultices employed, if the pain and inflammation become con- siderable.

INGUINAL HERNIA. 89 the sac at this part. From any sudden exertion or straining, which occasions a further protrusion, this part of the sac is forced into the inguinal canal, and when the patient is in the recumbent position, part or the whole of the contents of the sac being re- turned into the cavity of the abdomen, the portion of the sac which had been previously situated at the internal ring, and had been thickened, again takes its former position. This occurs again and again; but at length the sac becoming elongated, the thickened portion, which had been originally placed at the internal ring, no longer returns to this situation when the contents of the sac are reduced; but it remains in the inguinal canal, and may here at any future time be the cause of strangulation. When the stricture is thus formed, the surgeon should freely expose the contents of the hernial sac as far as the stricture, and then divide it in the same manner, and in the same direction as before described. Sometimes, but rarely, the seat of stricture is at the external abdominal ring, in which case the same plan of dividing the stric- ture should be adopted ; but it is not necessary to make so large an opening. If the hernia be direct, it is to be remembered that the sperma- tic cord is placed on its outer side. It is covered by the fascia of the cord, by the cremaster partially, and is contained in a sac formed by the tendon of the transversalis muscle, assisted by the fascia transversalis, besides a peritoneal sac, as in other hernia. The division of the stricture directly upwards is then applicable to every common case of strangulated inguinal hernia, whether ob- lique or direct; it is equally safe with any other division that has been proposed, and the operation is by it more simplified than hy adopting a different mode of dividing the stricture for each va- riety.

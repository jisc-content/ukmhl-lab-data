122 ON CRURAL HERNIA. From the centre of the orifice of the sac to the external iliac artery, one inch. From the centre of the orifice of the sac to the centre of the ex- ternal iliac vein, half an inch. From the centre of the orifice of the sac to the origin of the epigastric artery, three-fourths of an inch. From the centre of the orifice of the sac to the inner edge of the internal abdominal ring, one inch. From the tuberosity of the pubes to the centre of the orifice of the crural hernia, one inch. FEMALE. Each measurement is from one-eighth to one fourth of an inch more, where the female pubis is large and well formed, than in the male. The spermatic cord of the male, and the round ligament of the uterus in the female, pass about half an inch anterior to the mouth of the hernial sac, being first situated to the outer side, and after- wards crossing its fore part. When the opening through which the hernial sac has passed is examined anteriorly, it will be found that the sac, after descend- ing a little way into the crural sheath, turns inward and protrudes the inner part of this sheath where the absorbent vessels pass. The hernial sac is here placed between two columns of fascia of the crural ring sheath; the one proceeds from the anterior part of the insertion of the external oblique muscle into the pubes, is reflected behind the crural vein, and passes over the neck of the sac: the other arises from the point of insertion of the ex- ternal oblique into the linea ileo-pectinea and ligament of the pubes, is continued behind the neck of the sac, and is at last undistinguishably blended both with the fascia that covers the crural vein, and with that part of the fascia which passes over the pectineus muscle. The same general symptoms characterize crural as inguinal hernia; it appears in the erect, and disappears in the recumbent

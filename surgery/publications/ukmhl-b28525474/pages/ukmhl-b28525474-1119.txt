DISLOCATIONS OF THE OS lHJWERI. 423 head of the humerus, when dislocated downwards into the axilla ; but, under the different circumstances attending this accident, dif- ferent means must be employed: the first, and that which I usually adopt in my private practice in all recent cases, is By the Heel in the Axilla: And the best mode of its application is as follows. The patient should be placed in the recumbent posture, upon a table or sofa, I near to the edge of which he is to be brought; the surgeon then . binds a wet roller round the arm immediately above the elbow, ] upon which he ties a handkerchief; then with one foot resting upon the floor, he separates the patient’s elbow from his side, and Heel in the places the heel of his other foot in the axilla, receiving the head of ax'lld' the os humeri upon it, whilst he is himself in the half sitting pos- ture by the patient’s side. He then draws the arm by means of the handkerchief, steadily for three or four minutes, when, under common circumstances, the head of the bone is easily replaced; but if more force be required, the handkerchief may be changed j for a long towel, by which several persons may pull, the heel still remaining in the axilla. I generally bend the fore-arm nearly at right angles with the os humeri, because it relaxes the biceps, and consequently diminishes its resistance. I have, 'if many cases, extended from the wrist, by tying the handkerchief just above the hand, but more force is required in this than in the former mode, although it has this advantage, that the bandage is less liable to slip. In recent cases it very rarely I happens that this mode of extension fails, and it is so easily ap- plied in every situation, that I have recommended all our young men to employ it in the first instance, when called to this accident. Second Mode. But in those cases in which the muscles are of very considerable Second mode, strength, and the dislocation having existed for several days, the muscles have become permanently contracted, so that the limb is

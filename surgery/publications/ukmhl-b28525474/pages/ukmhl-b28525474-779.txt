OF ENCYSTED HERNIA. ON CRURAL HERNIA. 119 OF ENCYSTED HERNIA OF THE TUNICA VAGINALIS. This is a particular species of hernia, which occurs in the follow- How formed, ing manner. The tunica vaginalis becomes closed, by adhesion, opposite the abdominal ring, but remains open above and below it; and when a protrusion of intestine occurs, this adherent portion of the tunic becomes elongated, forming a distinct hernial sac within the proper tunica vaginalis. I had an opportunity of witnessing the following case, under the Case, care of Mr. Forster, in Guy’s Hospital. A man was admitted into the house with symptoms of strangulated hernia, which the usual means failed to relieve, and the operation was proposed and urged ; but the patient would not submit, choosing rather to die. On examining his body after death, a sac was found within the tunica vaginalis, descending from the abdominal ring towards the testicle. This sac contained a portion of one of the small intestines which had become gangrenous. The stricture was at the mouth of the sac. In operating upon a case of this kind, the tunica vaginalis should Operation, be opened freely, to expose the sac, otherwise some difficulty may arise. Mr. Hey, in his surgical observations, has related a case similar to that of Mr. Forster. LECTURE XLV. ON CRURAL HERNIA.

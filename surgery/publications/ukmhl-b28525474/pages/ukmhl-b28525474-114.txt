ACUTE AND chronic abscess. 80 Recapitula- tion. Acute abscess. occasion irritation of that part, and sometimes complete retention of urine. Thus, we find, that abscesses, though situated in parts not of themselves vitally important, sometimes become dangerous by their pressure on more important parts. The danger attending the formation of abscesses, arises from their size, number, and seat, or from their pressure on important parts: there is also another danger, if abscesses occur between the bones and periosteum. Whenever bones form the boundary of abscesses, such abscesses are tedious in their cure, and, in many cases, dangerous. Thus, it is in psoas abscess: in this disease the matter begins to collect on the fore-part of the vertebrae, and pro- ceeds through the psoas muscle, till it reaches the groin, where it makes its appearance just below Poupartâ€™s ligament; and from examination of these cases after death, the vertebrae are found ulcerated. It is not my intention now to enter into the considera- tion of psoas, or lumbar abscesses, as they will be treated of on another occasion; but I just mention the complaint, to show the danger of abscesses between the bones and their coverings; and that the reason is, the union between the soft parts and bone is with difficulty produced, and the process of restoration extremely tedious. LECTURE X. ACUTE AND CHRONIC ABSCESS. At the conclusion of our last lecture, gentlemen, we stated that the danger attending the formation of abscesses arose from their size, number, and pressure on important parts; and lastly, that when they formed in important parts themselves, they generally proved destructive to life. Now abscesses are either acute or chronic. The common course an acute abscess takes is three weeks. The

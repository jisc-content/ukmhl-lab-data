COMPOSITION or URINARY CALCULI. 368 descending by the ureter into the bladder, it there acquires an increase from the formation of a calculous deposit on it, of a different nature. COMPOSITION OF URINARY' CALCULI. My friend, Dr. Dowler, who has paid much attention to the analysis of these calculi, has favoured me with the following account: Urinary calculi of the human body may be comprehended under the following species. 1. Lithic acid, or uric acid calculus. 2. Lithate of ammonia. 3. Phosphate of lime, or bone earth. 4. Triple phosphate, or phosphate of magnesia and ammonia. 5. Oxalate of lime, or mulberry calculus. 6. Cystic oxide. Besides these, other substances have been mentioned as forming distinct species of calculi, such as xanthic acid, carbonate of lime, and the fibrinous calculi; but they are of extremely rare occurrence. The above calculi present the following chemical characters. 1.* Lithic acid calculus. Before the blowpipe it blackens and emits a peculiar smell, somewhat resembling that of burnt feathers; it is soluble in the caustic fixed alkaline solutions by the assistance of heat, and is again precipitated from these by the addition of an acid. The nitric acid dissolves and decomposes it with effervescence; if the solution be evaporated to dryness, a new acid, called the purpuric, and ammonia are formed; these, uniting, produce a purpurate of ammonia, which is of a pink colour, and soluble in water. 2. Lithate of ammonia. By the addition of a caustic fixed alkali, ammonia will be disengaged. The lithic acid may be shown by * I have omitted every character which is not essential to the particular species.â€”D.

221 WOUNDS OF THE THROAT. when attempted to be swallowed, are violently ejected from the wound. Hence, those ignorant of the structure of the parts, suppose that the air tube is injured, but the anatomist is aware that the wound has passed through the muscles of the jaw and tongue into the pharynx, being generally inflicted between the chin and os hyoides. The arteries, which bleed freely, are the sublingual, that pass Arteries wound just above the os hyoides on each side to the tongue; but some- ed‘ times the external carotid arteries are divided, when, from the rapid haemorrhage, death is almost immediate. TREATMENT. The wound is generally in itself but little dangerous ; and when persons die shortly after its infliction, it is frequently from the [ fever which has led to the commission of the act, if it be not from haemorrhage. Position in this wound is to be carefully attended to. If the Position, chin be elevated, the wound gapes widely; but when the chin is depressed, the frightful aperture becomes closed; the head should I therefore be brought down towards the chest, and confined in that position, in order to prevent a separation of the edges of the wound. I have generally put three sutures in the integument only, the Sutures, more effectually to guard against any disturbance of the approxi- mated edges, which may otherwise, from the constant motion of the patient during irritability or delirium, be produced. Such jsutures, through the integument only, are in this respect very use- ful, and are not ever disadvantageous. The patient’s mouth and tongue should be kept cool and moist.

352 THE M1I.K ABSCESS. Case. Treatment. Treatment. Formation of sinuses. the age of twenty years, so as to hang down upon the abdomen, not from relaxation but from real increase. I saw a case of this kind in a young woman, aged twenty-three, which began three years prior to my seeing her ; tender to the touch, of a dark red colour. She was often costive, but regular in her menstruation. Dr. Babington and myself witnessed the following case : Miss L., aged seventeen years, of a light complexion and delicate constitution, who is naturally costive, has a remarkable enlarge- ment of her breast. The left is twenty inches from its junction with the chest above to its lower part, and its circumference measures twenty-three inches. The nipple is flattened, the areola excessively expanded. The breast feels as if every lobe of the mammary gland was increased to several times its usual magnitude. The treatment consists in supporting the breasts in a suspensory bandage, in which each breast is received, and this is fixed over the shoulders. The medicine best calculated to be useful is hyd: c. creta with rhubarb and soda. THE MILK ABSCESS. This abscess requires the same general treatment in its adhesive, suppurative, and ulcerative stages, as we have recommended for abscesses of other parts. In general I leave them to break spon- taneously; but there are two exceptions to this. First, When the constitution and patient are suffering severely and the abscess is slow to break, it is right to assist nature with the lancet. And, secondly, when the abscess forms at the back of the breast very deeply, the aid of an artificial opening is required. When they ulcerate, sinuses, difficult to heal, are sometimes produced; and the best treatment is to inject them with a solution of zinc, or a dilute sulphuric acid, and to apply it constantly over the breast by linen.

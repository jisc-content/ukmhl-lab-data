848 FRACTURES OF THE KNEE. Excessive dis- tortion. How prevented. participating in the inflammation, draw the limb into distorted positions, and thus one bone becomes gradually displaced from the other. This state is most frequently seen in the hip-joint, from the oblique bearing of the thigh-bone on the pelvis. In the knee it is also not unusual that the thigh-bone shall be placed out of its natural line with the tibia, projecting either on the one side or the other. Now and then most remarkable distortions are produced by the irritative and spasmodic action of the muscles succeeding the ulcerative process of the ligaments. Mr. Cline removed the limb in St. Thomasâ€™s Hospital. It had been the con- sequence of what is vulgarly called the white swelling of the knee-joint; the leg was placed forwards at right angles with the thigh, so that when walking on his crutches he had the most grotesque appearance, as the bottom of his foot first met the eye when he was advancing. Upon inspection of the patella it was found anchylosed to the os femoris, and the tibia was also joined by ossific union to the fore part of the condyles of the thigh-bone. This state of parts may be prevented by opposing the action of the muscles when their irritability first begins to produce distor- tion ; by the application of splints; and by the exhibition of the pulvis ipecacuanhse compositus, to diminish the irritability of the system. Thus I have seen, in cases of ulceration of the hip-joint, the irritative action of the flexor muscles diminished, and future distortion prevented, by drawing down the limb and keeping it in the extended position; but as this extension is most painful to the patient, however desirable it may be, it should be accomplished very gradually. FRACTURES OF THE KNEE-JOINT. I shall now, pursuing my former plan, describe the fractures to which the bones entering into the composition of this part are liable ; and first, (he

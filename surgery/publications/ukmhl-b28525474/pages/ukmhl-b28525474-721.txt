PLATE IV. This Plate shews the different construction of trusses for the support of inguinal and femoral hernia. Fig. 1. Common inguinal hernia truss. Its spring encircles half the body, the circle being completed by a strap which is fastened to one of the studs on the long pad. This truss is well calculated for the working classes; and may be ren- dered still more secure by a thigh strap to prevent the pad rising. Fig. 2. Double truss of the same construction. Fig. 3. Represents Coles’s single truss for inguinal hernia on the right side. Fig. 4. Represents a double truss of Coles’s, constructed on the same principle, for inguinal hernia on each side. Fig. 5. Represents Coles’s half truss for umbilical hernia. Fig. 6. Is a representation of the spiral springs forming the pads, and covered with proper materials. The three last described trusses are capable of every modification, and are certainly the best calculated to pre- vent the descent of a hernia under any circumstances what- ever. The spring is formed with a view to combine the greatest degree of elastic power in the smallest space, and the spiral springs entering into the construction of the pads, gives them a decided superiority over every other truss yet offered to the public. Ed. Fig. 7. This figure represents on the right side a small oblique in- guinal hernia, making its appearance at the internal ring, on the outer side of the epigastric artery; and on the left side a scrotal hernia, with its coverings displayed by dissection. a a, Fascia superficial^ coming from the external abdominal ring,' and forming the external investment of the hernia. At its upper part the transverse fibres of the external ring are seen. b b b, Cremaster muscle thickened—seen descending under the

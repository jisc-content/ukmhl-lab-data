OF AMPUTATION AT THE SHOULDER JOINT. 482 Vessels. Operation with two flaps. Dressing. part of the acromion process; the integument and larger part of the deltoid muscle are thus raised, so as completely to expose the outer part of the shoulder joint; the arm being then drawn downwards, the catling is passed into the joint at the anterior part, so as to divide the tendon of the biceps muscle, and afterwards is carried round the head of the bone to cut through the capsular ligament: the separation of the limb may be completed either by passing the knife over the head of the bone, and cutting downwards to the axilla, or by placing the knife in the axilla and dividing upwards to the joint; in either case the amputation should be finished by one stroke of the catling. The axillary artery is to be immediately secured by a ligature, and small branches from the circumflex arteries may be required to be tied. When two flaps are required, the first incision extends from just below the point of the acromion downwards, and backwards into the axilla, being curved a little forwards and passing below the insertion of the latissimus dorsi muscle ; the back flap is then raised, dividing at the same time part of the deltoid, and the insertion of the latissimus dorsi; the anterior incision through the integument is begun from the same point as the posterior, but carried downwards and forwards below the insertion of the pectoralis major, into the axilla, so as to meet the termination of the first incision; this flap is then raised in part, to expose the capsular ligament, which is to be divided, together with the tendon of the biceps muscle as in the former operation ; after which, the head of the bone being dislocated, and the flaps being held back, the catling is passed behind the bone, and the amputation is completed by dividing the remaining portion of the anterior flap together with the axillary vessels, nerves, &c. The artery is to be secured as before mentioned. After either mode of amputating, the straps of adhesive plaster, employed to keep the edges of the wound in contact, are best applied from before to behind, and should be of sufficient length to keep a firm hold.

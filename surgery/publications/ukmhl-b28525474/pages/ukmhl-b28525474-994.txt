310 FRACTURES OF THE UPPER PART OF THE TIHGH-BONE. Absence of con- tinued pressure. which cannot be denied; but it is scarcely possible, even for a few hours, to preserve the limb in exact apposition, as the patient, on the slightest change of posture, produces instant retraction, by bringing into action those powerful muscles, which pass from the pelvis to the thigh-bone. So in fractures of the patella, although we often do all in our power to prevent retraction of the muscles, yet it very rarely happens that we are able to support a complete approximation of the bones. The second circumstance which prevents a bony union in these fractures is the want of pressure of one bone upon the other even if the length of the limb were preserved : and this will operate in preventing an ossific union in cases where the capsular ligament is not torn ; and in all those which I have had an opportunity of ex- . amining, it has not been lacerated. The circumstance to which I allude proceeds from the secretion of a quantity of fluid into the joint; from the increased determination of blood to the capsular ligament and synovial membrane ; a superabundance of serous synovia,—that is, synovia much less mucilaginous than usual,— which extends the ligament, and thus entirely prevents the contact of the bones, by pushing the upper end of the body of the thigh- bone from the acetabulum. After a time this fluid becomes absorbed, but not until the inflammatory process has ceased, and ligamentous matter has been effused into the joint from the in- terior of the synovial surface. The muscles, also, do not in this accident produce pressure between the broken extremities of bones, which so greatly conduces to the union of other fractures; for if two broken bones overlap each other, on that side on which they are pressed together, there is an abundant ossific deposit; but on tbe opposite side, where there is no pressure, scarcely any change is observed. So also we find that, if the ends of the bones be drawn from each other by the action of muscles, as sometimes happens in the fractures of the os femoris, tibia, os humeri, radius and ulna, union is not effected until the surgeon, by a strong leathern bandage tightly buckled around the limb, compels the

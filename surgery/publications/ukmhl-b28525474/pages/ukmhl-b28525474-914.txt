ON DISLOCATIONS AND FRACTURES*. TO THE STUDENTS OF ST. THOMAS’S AND GUY’S HOSPITALS. MY DEAR YOUNG FRIENDS, This Work has been composed for your use; and if you derive advantage from it, my principal object will be attained. I cannot, however, omit the opportunity of expressing my gratitude for the affectionate and respectful manner in which you have always received me as your instructor. Your parents, and rela- tives, many of whom were my pupils, are also entitled to my most grateful acknowledgments,—they fostered me in early life,— and by their friendship and recommendation have largely con- tributed to procure me a degree of success which, I fear, is beyond my merits, and a course of uninterrupted happiness which few have been permitted to enjoy. Believe me, always, Your affectionate Friend, ASTLEY COOPER. * Extracted from Sir Astlev’s large quarto work.

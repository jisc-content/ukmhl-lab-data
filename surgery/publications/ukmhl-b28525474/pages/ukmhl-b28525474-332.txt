278 OF THE SPERMATIC CORD. Spermatic cord. Abdominal origin. OF THE SPERMATIC CORD. The parts which compose this cord are situated in the abdomen (although not there formed into a distinct cord), in the inguinal canal, and between the abdominal ring and testicle. It consists of three arteries with their corresponding veins, of the vas deferens, of absorbents, and of nerves covered by fascia and by the cremaster muscle. OF THE PARTS IN THE ABDOMEN. The spermatic arteries take their origin from the anterior and lateral parts of the aorta, between the superior and inferior mesen- teric vessels; but much nearer the former than the latter, and a little below the renal arteries. But their origin is liable to great varieties. Sometimes one or other springs from the renal artery, sometimes both from the superior mesenteric artery at its root; and although they generally arise opposite to each other, yet in this respect they sometimes vary. They descend from their origin behind the peritoneum to the fore-part of the psoas muscles. On the right side, the artery passes anteriorly to the inferior cava, and on each side before the ureters. They diverge as they descend, passing to the lower part of the abdomen, to midway between the anterior and superior spinous process of the ilium and the symphisis pubis, and from a quarter to half an inch upon the outer side of the epigastric, and before the external iliac artery. In its course in the abdomen it becomes serpentine; as it descends, it gives off small branches to the cellular covering of the lower part of the kidney, to the ureters, and to the peritoneum. The spermatic arteries next enter the inguinal canal through the internal ring, and descend obliquely towards the external; from whence they emerge, and appear in the spermatic cord surrounded and enveloped by the spermatic veins.

465 DEFICIENCY OF THE PALATE. without any imperfection in the hone, the operation is performed in the same manner as when the fissure is confined to one side, but at I successive and distant periods, so as to allow time for the complete ! adhesion and union of one side, before the second operation be attempted. A fissure in the bone sometimes accompanies each fissure of the Extending ' lip, and then a projection of the insulated portion of bone occurs, the i in some instances, almost to the extremity of the nose. The operation may be then performed by removing, or not Operation, removing-, the projecting bone. I have successfully removed the projecting portion of bone, uniting the lip at a future period; but there was this objection to the mode of relief, that the upper lip did not project as usual from the want of that portion of the jaw and teeth, and an artificial jaw was required to form a support: it is better, therefore, to perform the operation upon each fissure of the lip, by uniting the skin upon each side, to that which remains upon the projecting bone, and to depend upon the modelling process of growth for the gradual diminution of the projection; the operation being the same as that which is necessary for the simple ! fissure. After the union of the lip, the diminution of the bony I projection may be assisted by gentle pressure. DEFICIENCY OF THE PALATE. When there is an aperture in the bony palate, the person suffers Inconvenience a twofold inconvenience : First, in a nasal pronunciation ; Secondly, in the passing of the food, particularly liquid, into the nose. If the opening be confined to the bony palate, there are two Two modes of modes of relief, one by the patientâ€™s wearing an artificial palate, the other by operation. The most simple of the artificial palates was made for me by Mr. Artificial no la fag Wiess, in the Strand, which consisted of two plates of silver1 connected together in the centres by an axis, so that the one could 2 H

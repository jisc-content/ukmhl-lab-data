112 OF INGUINAL HERNIA which it cannot be if the division of the stricture is made out- wards, and in the common hernia it will be divided by dilating in- wards. Some, however, have doubted the possibility of the epigastric artery ever being divided, whatever may have been the direction of the incision; and in support of this opinion, they adduce the great number of operations which have been performed by various practitioners, without the occurrence of this accident. However, this artery may actually have been divided, and produced the pa- tient’s death, by pouring its contents into the cavity of the abdo- men, without the surgeon being aware of the mischief which his knife has occasioned; and even when the accident has been known by him to have happened, the circumstance has been concealed from the public. OF INGUINAL HERNIA IN THE FEMALE. Structure of parts. Round liga- ment. Course of the hernia The structure of the inguinal canal in the female is very much the same as that which I have described in the male, only that the round ligament in the former takes the place of the spermatic cord existing in the latter. The round ligament, which commences at the fundus uteri, passes from the abdomen midway between the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium to the outer side of the epigastric artery, above Poupart’s ligament, and below the transversalis and internal oblique muscles, as the spermatic cord in the male; it takes a course obliquely downwards, and inwards to the external abdominal ring, through which it passes, and is lost upon the pubes. This round ligament, however, being much smaller than the spermatic cord of the male, passes through openings correspond- ing to its size, which are consequently much less than those for the spermatic cord, and on this account the formation of inguinal hernia in the female is of comparatively rare occurrence. When this hernia does occur in the female, it takes the course

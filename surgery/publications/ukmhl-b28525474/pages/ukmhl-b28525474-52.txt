TREATMENT OF IRRITATION. 16 Irritation mo- dified by age and tempera- ment. Wounds in the dissecting room. tioned, which shows that a great degree of injury may be incurred, and the person yet do well, occurred in another brewer’s man who was run over by a dray. There was compound fracture of the elbow joint, extensive laceration of the integuments, and a large wound communicating with the joint. The man was admitted into Guy’s Hospital; an operation was proposed, but the patient would not consent. The wound was therefore dressed, and in a short time it completely healed, without any unfavourable symptom shewing itself. Irritation is greatest in children, and least in aged persons; the former are very much affected by operations, whilst the latter are very slightly so. Children under two years of age, upon having stones removed from their bladders, will be frequently carried off by convulsions; therefore, if you can possibly avoid it, never perform the operation on a very young child, at all events not under two years of age. Thus, an injury which in one person would be attended with the most dangerous effects, will in another produce little constitutional derangement; and the same person may at one period suffer but little from a wound, which at another may give rise to fatal conse- quences. It is on this account that punctured wounds inflicted in the dissecting room, often produce such distressing effects; though it may, in some instances, arise from the absorption of morbid ,» matter, which usually produces the most aggravated form of constitu- tional irritation; it is therefore impossible that you can be too careful of the instruments you use in dissecting and opening bodies, as care- lessness on this point has caused the loss of many a valuable life. LECTURE II. , • TREATMENT OF IRRITATION. The treatment of irritation being much the same as that required in inflammation, I shall now give but a short description of it.

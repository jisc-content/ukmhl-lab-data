ANATOMY OF HERNIA. 9 feeble barrier, and herniae would probably be the invariable con- sequence of muscular exertion. This tendon rarely allows an in- testine to escape between its fibres ; strengthened by an interlace- ment of texture, it supports the weight of pregnancy and of drop- sical accumulations, resists the pressure arising from excessive obesity and from muscular contraction, and would altogether have exempted man from the occurrence of inguinal rupture, were it not for the existence of two openings in it about to be described. In the lower part of the tendon of each muscle, a little above and to the outer side of the symphysis pubis, is an opening called the abdominal ring, formed for the passage of the spermatic cord Abdominal ring, to the testicle in the male, and the round ligament of the uterus in the female. The following is the mode in which these openings are produced. The tendon of the external oblique, as it proceeds towards the pubes, splits into two columns, leaving a space for the passage of the spermatic cord : the upper broad column is attached to the symphysis pubis, and crosses its fellow on the opposite side; the lower rounded column, after being doubled under the spermatic cord, is fixed to the process of the pubes, called its spinous pro- cess, which may be felt in the living subject; from the under edge of this column, a process of tendon is sent obliquely backwards to the crest of the pubes. Thus it appears that the lower part of the tendon of each muscle has three insertions into the os pubis. First, into the symphysis, by means of the upper column of the ring: secondly, into the spinous process, by the inferior column: and, thirdly, into the crista, or linea ilio-pectinea, by means of a process of tendon called Gimbernatâ€™s ligament.

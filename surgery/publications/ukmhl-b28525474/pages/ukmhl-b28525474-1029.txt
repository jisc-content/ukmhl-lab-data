341 DISLOCATIONS OF THE KNEE. stances in it; the first was, the great deformity of the knee from the projection of the tibia; the second, the ease with which the bone was reduced by direct extension; and the third, the little inflammation which followed upon what appeared to be so serious m injury; for the man was discharged from the hospital after a few weeks, having suffered little local or no constitutional irri- tation. The tibia is sometimes thrown upon the outer side of the knee- loint, the condyle of the os femoris being placed in the situation of ;he inner semilunar cartilage, or rather behind it, when the same leformity is produced as in the external dislocation. The reduc- ;ion of the limb is equally easy with the former, and the patient recovers with little diminution of the powers of the part. It seems ;o me, that in both these dislocations the tibia is rather twisted ipon the os femoris, so that the condyle of the os femoris, with â€¢espect to the tibia, is thrown somewhat backwards, as well as lutwards or inwards. One of the aldermen of the city of London, riding down High- rate-hill during the night, and not being aware of a rail that was ilaced across a part of the road, which was undergoing repair, the lorse ran against the rail, and turning quickly, threw his rider >ver it, while his leg was confined between the rail and the horse, io that his body was on one side the rail and his leg on the other: he result of this accident was, that he partially dislocated his tibia mtwards, throwing the condyle of the os femoris inwards. Being mmediately taken to a public-house, the tibia was easily replaced; tnd on his removal home, some hours afterwards, means were used o reduce the swelling and inflammation, which became considerable. iVhen he attempted to bear upon the limb he found the capsular igament very feeble, and he was obliged to have a knee-cap made >f very strong leather, to support and connect the bones ; by the lid of this bandage he gradually recovered, and was enabled to valk well, and to do duty on horseback as a light-horse volunteer, icfore twelve months had expired. I was consulted by Mr. Richards respecting Mr. Bovill, a gen- External. Case of dislo- cation outwards.

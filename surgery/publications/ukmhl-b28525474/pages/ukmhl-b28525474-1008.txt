324 FRACTURES OF THE UPPER PART OF THE THIGH-BONE. the patient’s health having invariably suffered under the trials made to effect union, I should, if I sustained this accident in my own person, direct that a pillow should be placed under the limb throughout its length ; that another should be rolled up under the knee, and that the limb should be thus extended for ten days or a fortnight, until the inflammation and pain had subsided. I should then daily rise and sit in a high chair, in order to prevent a degree of flexion, which would be painful; and walking with crutches, bear gently on the foot at first; then, gradually more and more, until the ligament became thickened, and the muscles increased in their power. A high-heeled shoe should be next employed, by which the halt would be much diminished. Our hospital patients treated after this manner, are allowed in a few days to walk with crutches ; after a time a stick is substituted for the crutches, and in a few months they are able to use the limb without any adventitious support. The degree of recovery in these cases is as follows:—if the patient be very corpulent, the aid of crutches will be for a long time required; if less bulky a stick only will be sufficient; and where the weight of the body is inconsiderable, the person will be able to walk without either of these aids, but will drop a little at each step on that side, unless a shoe be worn having a sole of equal thickness to the diminished length of the limb. In every case, however, in which there is the smallest doubt whether it be a fracture within, or external to the ligament, it will be proper to treat the case as if it were the fracture which I shall hereafter de- scribe, and which admits of ossific union. It is gratifying to find opinions which have been for thirty years delivered in my lectures, confirmed by the observations of intel- ligent and observing persons; and, therefore, it is with pleasure that I read in the Dublin Hospital Reports, the account of the dis- section of several cases of fracture of the cervix femoris, by my friend Mr. Colies, of Dublin, (a man excellently informed in his profession,) who found in them similar want of ossific union, in the

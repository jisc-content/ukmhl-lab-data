308 OF THE SIMPLE CHRONIC ENLARGEMENT OF THE TESTIS. Constitutional treatment. Commence- ment of the disease. testicle very hard and considerably enlarged, and the cord at least three times its natural size. I said to the students, “ It will be of no use to operate in this case, for the disease has extended beyond the reach of the knife.” One of the students, who thought himself wiser than the rest of the world, told the man, if he would place himself under his care, he would take a lodging for him, and remove the part. The man consented, and this young man removed the testicle, tracing the cord, as I was informed, very much towards the abdomen. Peritoneal inflammation succeeded, and the man died in a few days, prematurely for the patient, usefully probably for the rest of life to this foolish and presumptuous student. This disease will require the same constitutional treatment as that which I before described, after the operation has been per- formed, to prevent the return of the complaint. LECTURE XXVII. OF THE SIMPLE CHRONIC ENLARGEMENT OF THE TESTIS. This is an extremely frequent disease, and one which has been mistaken for a malignant complaint of the part. This disease begins in hardness and swelling of the epididymis, at first unattended with pain. It gradually increases, without pain, until the testicle becomes involved in the disease ; the testis is quite smooth; the epididymis may be traced separately from the testis, the line of separation being more distinct than in the natural state. The patient’s health appears generally but little affected, and the part is so indolent, that the patient handles it with a degree , of roughness, which surprises the surgeon. Both testicles not unfrequently become affected at the same time; and sometimes, j when the enlargement is subdued in the one, the other becomes j diseased in a similar manner. The surface of the testicles and epididymis remain quite smooth, even under great increase of the part.

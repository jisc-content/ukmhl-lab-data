EFFECTS OF PUNCTURED WOUNDS ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. 181 occasioned the suppuration is too small to admit of the escape of the pus. The treatment, therefore, of these wounds, consists in endea- Treatment, vouring to prevent suppuration by leeches, and evaporating lotions, in the first instance; but, if matter does form, to open the abscess early, both with a view of making the punctured an incised wound, and to give a free outlet for the escape of the pus. ON THE EFFECTS OF PUNCTURED WOUNDS ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. The spasmodic and tetanic symptoms which follow punc- Tetanic sym- tured wounds, are the effects of injury to tendinous, rather 111011181 than nervous parts. Most of the cases of tetanus which I have seen occur from punctured wounds, have been when the hand or foot has been the seat of injury; the aponeurosis of the palm, or sole, or the tendons being hurt. I will not deny that an injury to a nerve will produce the same effect; but I cannot help doubting its being the usual cause. I divided the posterior tibial nerve in a Mrs. Sabine, the wife of Case, a surgeon at Dunchurch, for a painful tumour on it; and little constitutional irritation was produced by the operation. I removed a tumour from the median nerve of a gentleman, and Case, cut away two-thirds of the thickness of the nerve, leaving one- third ; tingling of the fingers, with some partial numbness, fol- lowed, but no constitutional irritation; and he did very well. I cut out five-eighths of an inch of the radial nerve, for aura Case, epileptica; and no unpleasant symptom followed, but the patient got well. Mr. Key removed a portion of the cubital nerve, for aura epileptica; and, although it did not cure the woman, it produced no unfavourable symptoms. These instances, to which many more might be added, as well as he usual seat of the wound, which produces tetanus, lead me to

DISLOCATIONS OF THE KNEE. 345 ached to it, which were tightly bound above and below the patella ; his, she said, answered its intended purpose better than any other ontrivance. In some of these cases great alteration takes place in the form md size of the knees, from a chronic rheumatism occasionally at- ending them. In the dissection of these cases, the ligament is found extremely hickened; little pendulous ligamentous and cartilaginous bodies .re seen suspended from it; a thick edge of cartilage projects rom the articular cartilage, and a part of the latter is absorbed. When the bone is macerated, a great addition of ossific matter is bund to have been made to the edges of the condyles of the os emoris. DISLOCATION OF THE KNEE-JOINT. Cases of dislocation of the knee-joint are so rare, that every nstance of this accident is worthy of recital; and I feel greatly ndebted to my friend, Mr. Toogood, surgeon at Bridgewater, for he following detail of a case of this description which occurred inder his care.

I saw him two hours after the accident. 1'he left knee was very much swollen ; the tibia, fibula, and patella vere driven up in front of the thigh ; and the os femoris occupied he upper part of the calf of the leg, the internal condyle being learly through the skin. It was a complete dislocation, and the tppearance of the limb so dreadful, that I despaired of being able o reduce it; but, to my surprise, it was more easily effected than ' imagined. By placing two men to the thigh whilst I extended he leg, the man became directly relieved. The whole limb was fiaced in splints, and thp strictest antiphlogistic treatment ob- lervcd, with the most perfect quiet. The symptoms were very

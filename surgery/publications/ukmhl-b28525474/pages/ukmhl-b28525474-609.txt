PREFACE. In presenting the second volume of Sir Astley Cooper’s Works to the public, the Editor begs to offer his sincere thanks for their kind reception of the first, and trusts that the care bestowed on the present volume will merit similar encouragement. This second volume comprises two of Sir Astley’s greatest works, Hernia, and Dislocations and Fractures, with illus- trative Plates from the Drawings of the same talented Artist who executed those of the first volume. The Plates will be found to illustrate the varieties of hernia in a progressive arrangement, accompanied with anatomical descriptions. The Editor’s grateful acknowledgements are justly due to R. D. Grainger, Esq., Professor of Anatomy at the Webb Street School, for an actual demonstration of the method of dissecting the parts concerned in forming hernia.

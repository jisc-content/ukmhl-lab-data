When the constitution has been long' accustomed to a discharge Caution in from an ulcer, some caution is requisite when healing it: nature continued'â„¢D appears to produce a quantity of blood equal to the discharge which discharges, those sores have supported, and to continue to do so after it has ceased, for, if done too suddenly, hectic or apoplectic symptoms are very apt to supervene. This may be prevented by great attention to the secretions, by giving frequently calomel at night, and an aperient in the morning: or by taking away occasionally some blood, when the above symptoms supervene. Ancient surgeons observed these; to obviate which they were in the habit of making issues in other parts of the body at the time of healing old sores. Quantities of matter, constantly discharging for a considerable period, inevitably act on the constitution as sources of depletion; and which, if suddenly discontinued, we may reasonably imagine would produce the symptoms before stated. There is no necessity, however, for issues to prevent them, as purgative medicines will answer much better, and speedily carry from the system, by a natural channel, any increase of its fluids.

Suppuration is best promoted by the application of heat and moisture; but we shall treat of this subject more particularly when we describe abscesses.

153 OF THE PERINEAL HERNIA. a syringe; the next scream brought down a large quantity of small intestines. I need not say, that this was sufficient to em- barrass a much better operator than myself; however, I proceeded in the operation with the greatest tranquillity, being convinced, i that this very extraordinary event was not owing to any error in the operation: but the difficulty was to keep the intestine out of the cheeks of the forceps, when I shoidd again attempt to lay hold of the stone; the extraction of which would be very difficult to I effect, from the unusual situation of the bladder in this subject. The lower part of the gorgeret remaining in the bladder, the for- ceps were again easily introduced, which being done with the fingers of my right hand, I pressed back the intestines, while I laid hold of the stone; but during the extraction the intestines were again pushed out by the child’s screaming; nevertheless, as I had the stone secure in my forceps, I proceeded to extract it, which I did very easily.

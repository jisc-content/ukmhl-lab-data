349 OF THE IRRITABLE TUMOUR. OF THE ADIPOSE TUMOUR. In the breast a fatty swelling- is sometimes formed. A Mrs. I Smith, of Great Yarmouth, applied to me, with an enormous tumour in her bosom. As her general health was good, I advised its removal. It weighed fourteen pounds and ten ounces: the ; gland of the breaS.t was placed before it. The preparation is in the Museum at St. Thomasâ€™s Hospital, and she recovered very quickly. The incision for its removal was thirty-two inches in circumference. OF THE IRRITABLE TUMOUR. This disease generally occurs in young women from the age of ^ung persons fifteen to thirty; the swelling never acquires magnitude, and is distinguished from those which I have described by the following circumstances : A lobe of the breast is slightly swollen; it is extremely tender Diabn0iis- to the touch, and, if handled, the pain sometimes continues for several hours. The uneasiness is not seated in the swelling only, but extends to the shoulder and axilla, down the arm to the elbow, and frequently to the wrist and fingers. It is very much increased prior to menstruation, is somewhat relieved during the period, and decreases after its cessation. The pain is sometimes so severe as to destroy rest; and even the weight of the breast in bed is some- times intolerably painful. When the pain is most severe, the stomach sympathizes, and vomiting is produced. The skin is undiscoloured, and there is no external mark of inflammation. Sometimes only a small portion of the breast is affected; at others, the greater part of the bosom; and I have known it affect the breast on each side. The constitution is highly irritable and sensitive, the hair of the patient is usually light, the complexion extremely delicate, and the temperament sanguineous. I have often known this disease continue for many months, Continues for a long period. sometimes tor years; and once during twelve years.

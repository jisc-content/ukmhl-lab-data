445 DISLOCATIONS OF THE ELBOW-JOINT. whilst it extends the arm, it supports the capsular ligament. The biceps muscle does not protect the ulnar joint, but has great influence in preventing a dislocation of the radius forwards, in the extended state of the arm. It is not connected with the capsular ligament, as the other muscles are; but arising tendinous from the glenoid cavity, and coracoid process of the scapula, it becomes fleshy in its middle, and again forms a tendon at the elbow-joint, which is fixed into the tubercles of the radius. This muscle bends the fore-arm, rotates the radius outwards, that is, supines the hand, and compresses the capsular ligament opposite the head of the radius. DISLOCATIONS OF THE ELBOW-JOINT. There are five species of dislocation of this joint : â€” First, both bones are dislocated backwards. Secondly, both are dislocated laterally. Thirdly, the ulna is dislocated separately from the radius. Fourthly, the radius alone is dislocated forwards : and Fifthly, the radius is dislocated backwards. DISLOCATION OF BOTH BONES BACKWARDS. This dislocation is strongly marked by the great change which is produced in the form of the joint, and by its partial loss of motion. The shape of the elbow is altered, as there is consider- able projection posteriorly, formed by the ulna and radius, above the natural situation of the olecranon. On each side of the ole- cranon appears a hollow. A considerable hard swelling is felt at the fore part of the joint, immediately behind the tendon of the biceps muscle, formed by the extremity of the humerus ; the hand and fore-arm are supine, and cannot be rendered entirely prone. The flexion of the joint is also in a great degree lost. Symptoms. DISSECTION OF THIS DISLOCATION. I have had an opportunity of dissecting a compound dislocation of this joint, where the radius and ulna were thrown backwards, Dissection of the dislocation backwards.

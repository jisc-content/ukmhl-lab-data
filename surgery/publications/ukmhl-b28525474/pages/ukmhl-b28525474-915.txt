PLATE I. OF DISLOCATIONS, Shews the positions of the limb in the different dislocations of the thigh-bone, and in the fracture of the cervix femoris. Fig. 1. The thigh-bone dislocated upwards upon the dorsum ilii. The limb shortened,—the hip projecting,—the knee and foot turned inwards, and the toes resting on the metatarsal bones of the other foot; the head of the bone is thrown back, and the trochanter major forwards. Fig. 2. Shews a dislocation downwards into the foramen ovale. The limb is longer than the other,—the knee advanced and se- parated from the other,—the toes pointed,—the heel does not touch the ground ; the body is bent forwards: in all other accidents of this joint, the limb is lengthened. Fig. 3. Dislocation into the ischiatic notch. The limb shortened, — the patella nearly an inch above the other,—the knee and foot turned slightly inwards,—with the great toe resting against the ball of the great toe of the other limb; the leg is separated with diffi- culty from the other. Fig. 4. Dislocation of the os femoris upon the pubes. The head of the bone projecting at Poupart’s ligament,—the knee and foot turned out and widely separated from the other,—the limb short- ened a little. Fig. 5. Fracture of the neck of the thigh-bone. The limb is shortened,—the knee and foot everted,—the limb may be easily drawn to the same length as the other, and then if rotated a cre- pitus will be felt.

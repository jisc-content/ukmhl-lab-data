OF THE TREATMENT OF THIS DISEASE. No medicine has been yet discovered which has any influence over this disease, when it has been once formed. The common remedies used for the preservation of the general health may, by improving the constitution, lessen or prevent the tendency to the disease ; but no medicine has any influence upon it when the local disease has once appeared.

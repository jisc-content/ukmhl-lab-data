DISLOCATIONS OF THE WRIST-JOINT. 465 left, whilst an assistant places his hands around the upper arm, just above the elbow; they then pull in different directions, and the bone becomes easily replaced. The reduction is, in both cases, the same; for the muscles draw the bones towards their natural position as soon as they are separated from the carpus by extension. When the hand recovers its natural situation, a roller, wetted in spirits of wine and water, is to be lightly applied around the wrist, and the whole is to be supported by splints placed before and behind the fore arm, reaching as far as the extremities of the metacarpal bones, for the more perfect security of the limb. DISLOCATION OF THE RADIUS AT THE WRIST. This bone is sometimes separately thrown upon the fore part of Diagnostic, the carpus, and lodged upon the scaphoid bone and the os tra- accident, pezium. The outer side of the hand is, in this case, twisted back- wards, and the inner forwards: the extremity of the radius can be felt and seen, forming a protuberance on the fore part of the wrist. The styloid process of the radius is no longer situated opposite to the os trapezium. This accident usually happens from a fall when the hand is bent Cause of tlie back ; and I have also known it arise from a fall upon the hand, by which the condyles of the os humeri were broken obliquely, and the radius dislocated at the wrist, being thrown upon the fore part of the scaphoid bone, where it could be distinctly felt: this was the case of the lad whom I mentioned when speaking of frac- tures of the os humeri; his hand was hanging backwards, and he felt great pain upon its being moved. The extension necessary to reduce a dislocation of the radius, and the treatment which it demands, are the same which are required for the luxation of both bones; and there is no difficulty in the operation, the hand being extended whilst the fore arm is fixed.

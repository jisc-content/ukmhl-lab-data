OF THE PERINEAL HERNIA. 151 dilatation on coughing; also appearing in the erect position, and disappearing when the patient is recumbent. The situation of the swelling, and its want of connection with the abdominal ring, sufficiently distinguish it from inguinal hernia, which also appears in the labium, but at the upper part. The increase of this disease may be prevented by the patientâ€™s constantly wearing a bandage to support the part; but a partial protrusion cannot readily be checked, as from its situation, a pes- sary, unless of very large size, would not be of any service. When strangulated, the usual remedies before mentioned should be tried ; and, if an operation becomes necessary, the sac should be carefully opened, and the stricture divided inwards towards the vagina, the bladder being previously emptied. OF THE VAGINAL HERNIA. This hernia protrudes between the uterus and rectum, where the peritoneum is reflected from one viscus to the other, at the pos- terior part of the vagina; sometimes, however, it appears at one side instead of the posterior part. It is only covered by the lining membrane of the vagina. The use of a pessary will prevent the protrusion of this disease. OF THE PERINEAL HERNIA. In the male, this hernia protrudes between the bladder and rec- tum ; and, in the female, between the rectum and vagina. I have only seen one instance of this disease, which was in the body of a male brought into the dissecting room. The reflected portion of peritoneum between the bladder and ectum, was protruded as far as the perineum, but no external tu- nour was perceptible; Mr. Cutliffe, surgeon, at Barnstaple, has he parts preserved. Anterior to the sac were seated part of the bladder, the prostrate gland and terminations of the vesicular seminales; behind was the Treatment. When strangu- lated. Its seat. Treatment. Its seat.

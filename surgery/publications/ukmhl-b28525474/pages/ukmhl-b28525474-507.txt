391 OF REMOVING STONES FROM TIIE BLADDER BY THE URETHRO- VESICAL FORCEPS.* When a great number of calculi are found in the bladder, there Number of calculi. is generally an enlargement of the prostate gland, and a sacculus formed in the bladder directly behind it. In these cases the bladder is rarely emptied completely of its fluid contents, and calculi form from the urine retained in the sac. Such stones do not in general acquire the magnitude of those Usually small, formed under the usual circumstances ; and from their number and friction against each other, their surfaces are generally smooth, and their shape rounded. Fifty-six such calculi were found in the bladder of Mr. Perkins, the brewer, who died from retention of urine. Persons who labour under this form of the disease, sometimes Sometimes passed with pass the smaller of the calculi whilst making water; but the larger the urine, still remain, producing retention of urine, and the operation of lithotomy has often been performed for them; but, as the following cases will prove, they may be extracted from the bladder by means which do not expose the patient to any loss of blood, do not occasion the slightest danger, or any very considerable degree of suffering. 1 am fully aware of the impossibility of extracting large urinary calculi by the means which are here recommended ; yet I cannot but feel a hope that they may be removed, in the early stages of the disease, by the following means, before they acquire a bulk too large to pass by the urethra. In the infant also, it will be extremely difficult to contrive an instrument of sufficient delicacy to be introduced into the bladder through the urethra, which shall possess such a degree of strength as to enable it to grasp the stone firmly, and to extract it with safety. * These observations and cases have been already published in the Medico- Chirurgical Transactions, vols. xi. and xii.

168 ON WOUNDS.â€” OF THE INCISED WOUND. Of four kinds. Character. Treatment. LECTURE XLVII. ON WOUNDS. Solutions of continuity on the surface of the body are of four kinds, according to tire manner in which they are produced; viz. Incised, Lacerated, Contused, and Punctured. Incised, when produced by a cutting instrument; lacerated, when the parts are forcibly rent asunder; contused, when occa- sioned by some heavy body, or one passing with great velocity; and, punctured, if made by a pointed substance. This division of wounds is attended with advantage in the de- scription of their treatment, as it must in some degree vary from the mode of their production. OF THE INCISED WOUND. The lips of the divided parts are more or less separated accord- ing to the extent of the injury; and the division of the muscles, which, by their contraction, lead to a gaping state of the wound, as in the cheek, the lips, or in transverse incisions in the limbs. The wound is covered with blood, which is florid or purple, as an artery or vein has been injured. If an artery, the blood flows by jets rapidly, and is of a florid colour; if a vein, the bleeding is slow, gradually filling the wound, and the blood is of a purple colour. Fainting is produced if an artery be cut, but rarely, if the bleeding be venous. Fainting also results if the wound ex- tends to parts of vital importance, even although the haemorrhage be very slight. . When you are called to a case of incised wound, you are to make pressure upon its surface with a sponge to arrest the haemorrhage, and if the divided vessels be small, you will soon find it subside under a steady and continued pressure. But if an artery of any magnitude has been injured, it should be drawn from the surrounding parts by a pair of forceps, or raised by a tcna-

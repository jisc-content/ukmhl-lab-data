LECTURE XVIII. ON WOUNDS OF THE BRAIN. Wounds of the brain will often happen, without producing any interruption to the operations of either body or mind. But should the wound be accompanied by either compression or concussion, then the particular symptoms which characterize those injuries will be present. If, however, the wound be a simple incision or lacera- tion, it will often prove quite harmless. Indeed, it frequently

149 OF VENTRAL HERNIA. OF THE REDUCIBLE VENTRAL HERNIA. When seated in the linea alba, a truss, similar to that employed Truss, for umbilical hernia, should be worn; but, when low down in the linea semilunaris, the truss applied should resemble that recom- mended for inguinal hernia, only that the pad must be turned some- what upwards. When irreducible, the same form of truss, with a hollow pad, will be required. OF STRANGULATED VENTRAL HERNIA. The symptoms indicating strangulation of this hernia are, in Symptoms, every respect, similar to those already described, as occurring when umbilical hernia is in the same state ; and the means which should be tried, with a view of relieving the patient, should be of a like nature. As in the umbilical disease, the tobacco enema has here a more Treatment, powerful effect than in the inguinal or femoral herniae. In employing the taxis, the pressure should be made a little Taxis, upwards as well as inwards, for the swelling, like the umbilical, j has the greater part situated below the opening from the abdo- men. If an operation becomes necessary for the relief of the patient. Operation, i it should be performed in the same mode as that described for umbilical hernia; but when the disease is seated low down in the linea semilunaris, the surgeon must bear in mind the course of the epigastric artery, and divide the stricture so as to avoid it. In very large ventral herniae, the operation I have mentioned For large before, of merely exposing the neck of the sac, and dividing the stricture, without opening the sac itself, may be adapted with ad- vantage. In the after-treatment of these cases, nothing of importance is After-treat- necessary beyond wlxat I have already recommended for the other ment' forms of herniae.

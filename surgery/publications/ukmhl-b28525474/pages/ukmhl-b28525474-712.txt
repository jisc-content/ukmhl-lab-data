When a hernia is incapable of being returned into the abdomen by outward pressure, it is termed irreducible. The following are the causes which induce this condition of the protruded parts :— First,—When they are suffered to remain long down, they in- crease so much in size as to be incapable of reduction. Secondly,—Membranous bands form across the sac, and thus en- tangling its contents, prevent their free motion. Thirdly,—The protruded parts become closely united by an adhesion to the sides of the sac, sufficiently firm to render them immoveable. By whatever cause a hernia becomes irreducible, the patient is rendered subject to many inconveniencies and dangers. The principal danger is of strangulation of the protruded parts; how- ever this is certainly less in the irreducible hernia than in one that descends only occasionally; for in the former, the sac is already nearly full, and cannot readily admit of any great increase of its contents. But the patient is liable to danger from other causes, as will readily be seen by the following case. A man was brought into Saint Thomas’s Hospital who had fallen from a ladder, and his scrotum, in which was a large hernia, struck upon the edge of a piece of wood. After complaining of violent pain and tension in his abdomen, in four hours he died. On examining his body after death, a portion of the ilium which had formed a part of the hernia, was found ruptured. Another danger incurred by irreducible hernia is that of ulcera- tion. This may happen when any pointed body is swallowed, and follows the course of the food down the intestinal canal into the hernial sac; when arrived in this place, it has been known to make its way out by ulceration, leaving a passage for the faeces. An irreducible hernia sometimes becomes of a most enormous size when it has remained entirely unconfined, and it then produces

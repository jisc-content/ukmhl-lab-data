For the structure, which I am presently to describe, is liable, particularly in the male, to be affected with the two malignant diseases to which the body is subject, namely, to the scirrhous affection, or to the fungous. OF THE SCIRRHUS OF THE MAMMILLA. Symptoms. Ulceration. Bleeding. Glands affected. Removal necessary. This disease begins with a circular swelling at the root of the nipple. It is at first free from pain, but is excessively hard, and is somewhat irregular upon its surface. It gradually increases in size, and during its growth a shooting, darting, and occasionally a lancinating pain strikes through the swelling, and to the shoulder, in the course of the mammary nerves. A slight ulceration next supervenes upon the surface of the nipple, which is succeeded by a yellowish brown incrustation. When the first incrustation is separated, it is succeeded by another, and a deeper ulceration ensues, by which process the nipple of the breast is gradually removed, and the scirrhous substance is exposed. Whilst the ulceration is proceeding in the centre, the scirrhus increases in circumference, until it occupies a considerable circle round the nipple, and as the bulk of the disease augments, the pain with which it is accompanied is likewise aggravated; yet the diseased part is only in a slight degree tender to the touch, and the patient is often seen to handle it in an unfeeling manner. The discharge from it, which had previously formed an incrus- tation, now increases, and becomes fluid, and the sore frequently bleeds. The glands in the axilla become enlarged and hardened, after a long continuance of the complaint. The patientâ€™s lungs become diseased, and water is effused into the cavity of the chest. I have seen several males and one or two females die of this complaint; and I have given a view of the appearance which the swelling assumes on dissection. As this disease is beyond the control of medicine, for none that I

After the funis has been tied, this opening usually becomes closed by dense cellular tissue, and the remains of the umbilical i veins and arteries, but not by a tendinous structure. The in- J tegument over it is adherent, and generally drawn in, forming the navel. Behind the navel, when these parts are dissected, the peritoneum is found, which adheres more firmly at this part than any other of the linea alba ; it is connected above to the remains of the umbilical vein, and below to the ligament of the bladder and remains of the umbilical arteries. There is not any perforation in the peritoneum behind the navel, as the vessels do not penetrate it, but pass be- tween it and the abdominal parietes. Umbilical hernia commences in a small protrusion about the size of a nut, which can be easily reduced, but which again ap- pears immediately the patient coughs or exerts himself.

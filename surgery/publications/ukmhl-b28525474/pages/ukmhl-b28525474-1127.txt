DISLOCATIONS OF THE OS HUMERI. 431 shoulder received the blow, the head of the bone must have been driven forwards and inwards. REDUCTION OF THE DISLOCATION FORWARDS. In this, as in the former case, we can usually succeed in effect- ing reduction by placing the foot in the axilla, and by extending the arm in the same manner; excepting that, in this dislocation, the foot is required to be brought more forward to press on the head of the bone, and the arm should be drawn obliquely down- wards, and a little backwards ; but in those cases in which some days have elapsed before reduction has been attempted, continued â€¢: extension will be necessary ; and, to employ it steadily and effect- ually, the pulleys should be used. The same bandage is required as in the dislocation in the axilla, whether the power used be applied through the medium of pulleys, or directly by men. The arm should be bent to relax the biceps muscle; but the principal circumstance to be considered is, the direction in which the bone is to be drawn, and the best direction is slightly downwards; for if it be drawn horizontally, the head of the os humeri is pulled against the coracoid process of the scapula, and a difficulty created which may be avoided. The principle upon which the pulley is employed, and the manner in which the extension is supported, are the same as in the dislocation into the axilla ; but the direction is different, the arm being drawn obliquely downwards and backwards. The extension must be kept up longer than in the dislocation downwards, as the resist- i ance is greater; but as soon as the bone is felt to move from its situation, the surgeon should give the strings of the pulley to an assistant, and putting his knee or heel against the head of the bone at the fore part of the shoulder, should push it back towards the glenoid cavity : but this step is not of the smallest utility until the bone has been drawn below the level of the coracoid process: and whilst the surgeon is thus pressing the head of the bone back- wards, he should pull the arm forwards from the elbow. This is j the plan which I have found by far the most effectual in reducing the dislocation forwards.

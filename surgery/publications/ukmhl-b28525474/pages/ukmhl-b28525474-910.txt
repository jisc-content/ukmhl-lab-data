The division of a nerve, or even pressure upon the spinal mar- row, so as to destroy volition and sensation, does not prevent the involuntary action of the limb or limbs from proceeding. The cir- culation still proceeds, and the irritability of the part remains, as is shown in the application of a blister, which produces the usual ve- sication ; also, a wound heals by the adhesive process. Friction and electricity seem to have some influence in restoring action in a divided nerve, or of one which has partially lost its power from any other cause. Pressure upon a nerve, occasions the sensation of a part being asleep ; striking the cubital nerve at the elbow, occasions violent tingling in the little finger, and half the ring finger. OF SPRAINS.

The most common situations of these accidents are either at the wrist or ancle, arising from sudden falls, by which joints are unex- pectedly and forcibly bent. These injuries are attended with considerable pain at the time of the accident, and the part soon becomes swollen and tender; the former symptom arises from the effusion of blood, in the first instance, out of the lacerated blood vessels, and becomes subse- quently much increased from inflammation ; the tenderness and pain are generally in proportion to the tumefaction.

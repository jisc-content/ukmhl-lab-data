231 OF WOUNDS OF THE NERVES. OF WOUNDS OF THE NERVES. The immediate effect of the division of a nerve of a limb, is the Effect of. loss of volition in those muscles to which the nerve is distributed, and the antagonist muscles being unopposed, gradually contract. If the nerve supplying the flexors is divided, the limb becomes extended; if that distributed to the extensors is separated, the opponent muscles keep the extremity flexed. This arises from the tendency a muscle possesses to occupy the smallest space possible, and which differs from voluntary or involuntary contraction, as the latter can only continue for a time; but the former is perma- nent, or as long as the antagonist muscles are paralysed. The second effect of the division of a nerve is the diminution of sensibility; I call it diminished, because I do not find that the division of the branch of a nerve, although it benumbs the parts, entirely deprives them of sensation. In the division of the infra orbitar nerve, or of one of the nerves of the fingers, some sensation remains, but numbness is produced; when, however, all the nerves passing to an extremity are divided, sensation is entirely destroyed. I once saw a case, in which one of the branches of the median Case, nerve was divided in the palm of the hand; and if pressure was made on the radio spiral nerve at the elbow, it produced a tingling sensation in the benumbed finger *. The temperature of the part to which the nerve is distributed, if it be covered so as to prevent the access of a colder medium, is greater than that of parts similarly covered ; but if it be left alto- gether bare, it then has less power of resisting diminished temper- ature than the surrounding parts. I have seen severe chilblains, and during the winter incurable ulceration, follow the division of the median nerve. * It would appear by this that nervous influence is supported in a degree by anas- | tomosis.

10 EXPLANATION OF PLATE I. of the fasciae which are connected witli Poupart’s ligament, as well as the course of the spermatic cord under the edges of the internal oblique and transverse muscles, before it reaches the abdominal ring. a. Symphysis pubis. b b. Anterior and superior spinous process of the ilium, c c. External oblique muscles. d. Linea alba extending down to the symphysis pubis, and formed by the union of the tendinous fibres of the two oblique and transverse muscles. e e. Lineae semilunares, formed by the union of the tendinous fibres of the external and internal oblique and transverse muscles. f f. The abdominal rings, formed by the separation of two co- lumns of tendinous fibres ; the upper inserted at a into each os pubis ; the lower inserted into the pubes at It, after passing behind the spermatic cord. g. The origin of some tendinous fibres which proceed from the anterior spinous process of the ilium, and crossing the columns of tendon, assist in uniting them above the ab- dominal ring. i i. Poupart’s ligament, or the crural arch, which is extended from the anterior spinous process of the ilium at b, to the pubes at h, receiving the lower column of tendon, which forms a part of the abdominal ring, and which passes be- hind the cord to be inserted from the spinous process to the crest of the pubes. k. The fascia lata of the thigh, which is continued from Pou- part’s ligament, and seen turning in under the femoral . vessels near the middle of the fore part of the thigh. l. Is the saphaena major vein of the leg going through the j fascia to enter the femoral vein. m. Another part of the same fascia which arises from Poupart’s ! ligament, and joins with the fascia lata, which it assists in forming.

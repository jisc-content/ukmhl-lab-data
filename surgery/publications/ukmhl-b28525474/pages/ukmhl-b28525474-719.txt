71 STRANGULATED HERNIA. and transversalis muscle and its tendon, which pass over the hernial sac in a semicircular direction, and by the fascia trans- versalis arising from Poupartâ€™s ligament, the semicircular bor- 1 der of which passes under the sac, and which has been men- tioned in the anatomical description of the parts, is represented a preparation of a hernia thus strangulated by pressure above the ring. Hereby may be explained the opinion which some sur- geons have entertained of the spasmodic nature of the stricture, a state which it was difficult to account for when the seat of stran- gulation was supposed to be confined to the external ring, as this tendinous aperture possesses no muscular action, and therefore cannot assume the state of spasm. But when the strangulation is at the upper ring, a portion of intestine protrudes under the edge of the internal oblique and transversalis muscles, compressing them, which in their turn, being excited to contraction by the irri- tation of this pressure, re-act upon the intestine with a force suffi- ! cient to produce a strangulation, accompanied with spasmodic i symptoms. If then the surgeon, during the operation for hernia, I examine accurately into the seat of the strangulation, he will find that, except in large herniae, cutting through the external ring is insufficient to release the protruded parts, but he must proceed with his knife obliquely outward, before he can return the swelling. For the truth of this assertion I would appeal to those surgeons best acquainted with the structure of the parts, who have per- formed the operation most frequently and with the greatest attention. The mouth of the hernial sac, when it becomes the seat of stric- ture, has been thickened on the inner part by the pressure of the tendons of the internal oblique and transversalis muscles, and if a truss has occasioned much pressure on its outer side, the whole circle of the sac becomes thickened in consequence. Thus the i cause of stricture at the mouth of the sac is occasioned by parts | external to it. Moreover, though the abdominal ring be dilated witli freedom, the hernia will in many cases still retain its colour of strangulation and remain as irreducible as before ; but if the sac

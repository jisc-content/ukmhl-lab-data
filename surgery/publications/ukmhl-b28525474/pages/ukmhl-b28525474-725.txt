Eating flatulent vegetable food, is pecu- liarly apt to induce strangulation. This latter cause operates by distending the intestinal canal, causing it to occupy more space than before in the abdomen, and consequently pushing out part of the viscera into the hernial sac. A small hernia is more easily strangulated than a large one, the pressure on the contents being more violent, and the symptoms are much more urgent, as the stricture acts with more effect upon a single knuckle in stopping its circulation than when the contents of a hernia are large and voluminous; and a hernia which appears suddenly is more liable to this accident than one of long standing, which has been in the habit of frequently coming down, the aperture which admits of the descent of the latter being enlarged from repeated protrusion, while in the former it is proportionally contracted around the intestine. LECTURE XLIII. TREATMENT OF STRANGULATED HERNIA. As all the symptoms which have been described in a preceding part originate from the compressed state of the protruded parts, it must be the surgeonâ€™s object to return them as soon as possible into the cavity of the abdomen, and he is only wasting time by any attempts to alleviate the violence of the symptoms independent of this principal object. The return of the part is first to be attempted by what is termed the Taxis. This is done by making pressure with the hands upon the tumour, and at the same time placing the patient in that posture which gives as much room as possible in the abdomen and relaxes its muscles and apertures. The best position for this pur- Small hernia more easily strangulated. Taxis. Position of the patient.

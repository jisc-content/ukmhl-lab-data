FRACTURES OF THE ELBOW-JOINT. 461 COMPOUND FRACTURE OF THE OLECRANON. In compound fractures of this bone, the edges of the skin must be brought into exact apposition ; lint, embued in blood, must be applied on the wound, with adhesive plaster over it, and union by adhesion must be effected if possible; but in other respects the treatment is the same as in simple fracture. I have seen two cases of this accident, both of which have been successfully treated. FRACTURE OF THE NECK OF THE RADIUS. This fracture I have heard mentioned by surgeons as being of frequent occurrence; but there must be some mistake in the state- ment, for it is an accident which I have never seen; and if in- stances ever present themselves (which I do not mean to deny) they must be very rare.

If such an accident should occur, the treatment which it will require will be the same as that which is demanded for fracture of the external condyle of the os humeri. COMPOUND FRACTURES AND DISLOCATIONS OF THE ELBOW-JOINT. These generally happen through the internal condyles of the os humeri, and the fracture takes an oblique direction into the joint. In the most severe accident of this kind, the constitution is gene- Generally not rally able to support the injury, if it be judiciously treated; and destructlve' the recital of the following cases will evince the happy result that may be expected, if union by adhesion be effected in the treatment. I was called to Guy’s Hospital, to see a brewer’s servant, who Case, had a compound fracture of the elbow-joint, caused by his dray passing over his arm, which had considerably comminuted the bones. I could pass my finger readily into the joint, and feel the brachial artery pulsating on its fore part. Considering the violence

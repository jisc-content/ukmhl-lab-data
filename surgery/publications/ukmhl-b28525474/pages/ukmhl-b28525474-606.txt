OF AMPUTATION at the hip-joint. 490 Part cut away. Plasters snipped. Mode of removing the plaster. Sometimes to be removed early. Separation of ligatures. by which time the adhesion of the edges of the wound will have become sufficiently firm to prevent any risk from the removing the dressings, provided it be done carefully. Should the patient experience shooting pain in the stump, and have other symptoms of suppurative inflammation, some portion of the plaster should be cut away from the lower part of the wound, in order to allow of the escape of any matter that may form, and a light poultice should be applied. When a tightness is felt at any part of the stump from the pressure of the plaster, the surgeon should snip some of the straps on the side, which will generally relieve the pressure. When the stump is dressed, the straps of plaster should be taken off- one by one, and care is required not to disturb the ligatures ; if union of the wound be not complete, some fresh straps should be applied as the old ones are removed, by which mode separation of the edges of the wound may be greatly prevented. Should the first dressings become much loosened, or the stump be excessively painful, the plasters must be removed earlier than I have mentioned. If the ligatures do not come away by the fourteenth day after the operation, the surgeon should gently draw each thread when he dresses the wound, in order to expedite their separation.

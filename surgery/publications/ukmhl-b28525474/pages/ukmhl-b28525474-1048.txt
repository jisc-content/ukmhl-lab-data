360 FRACTURES OF THE KNEE. as to reach to the edge of the patella, is to be dipped in warm water, applied under the knee, and confined by a roller. When this is dry, it will have exactly adapted itself to the form of the joint, and this form it will afterwards retain, so as best to con- fine the bones. Splints of wood or tin may be used on each side of the joint, but they are apt to cause uneasy pressure. In five weeks passive motion of the limb may be gently begun, to prevent anchylosis. I prefer the straight position in these cases, because the tibia presses the extremity of the broken condyle into a line with that which is not injured. Examples of compound fractures of the condyles are very unfrequent. To aged persons these accidents sometimes prove fatal; and indeed I have known a simple fracture of the condyles terminate fatally. Oblique frac- tures of the condyles. OBLIQUE FRACTURES OF THE OS FEMORIS JUST ABOVE ITS CONDYLES. This is a most formidable injury from its consequence on the future form and use of the limb; for it is liable to terminate most unfortunately, by producing deformity, and by preventing the â€™< flexion of the knee-joint. It is only of late years that I have had an opportunity of inves- tigating this case by dissection; and, consequently, of obtaining substantial knowledge of the exact nature of the injury. The appearances produced by it are, that the lower and broken ex- tremity of the shaft of the bone projects, and forms a sharp point just above the patella, which pierces the rectus muscle, threatens to tear the skin, and sometimes does tear it: whilst the patella, tibia, and condyles of the os femoris sink into the ham, and are drawn upwards behind the broken extremity of the shaft of the os femoris. The accident happens when the person falls from a considerable height upon his feet, or is thrown upon the condyles of the os femoris with the knee bent. In all the cases the fracture was very

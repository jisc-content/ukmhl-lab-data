DISSECTION. 325 In June, 1818, in the presence of Mr. Cline, 1 removed this tumour, by making two flaps, as in the last operation, and I tied the arteries, which I divided as I proceeded. Little constitutional irritation followed, and in six weeks Mrs. W. was well. The appearances in this breast were similar to those in Lady Hewett’s. Mrs. Styles, aged 28, had a tumour in the breast which had Case, existed three years, and which was sometimes painful from changes of temperature, and sometimes from the approach of menstruation; but the pain was inconsiderable. It began in a swelling of the size of a filbert, which was hard and moveable; but it gradually became larger, until it was about two inches in diameter: her menstruation and bowels were regular, but rather inclined to costiveness; her general health was good. My nephew, Mr. Bransby Cooper, removed this swelling before me; and when he cut into the tumour, a bladder of water was opened. The cyst, in which the water was contained, appeared very vas- cular ; it was then removed: the wound healed in a fortnight; but an abscess afterwards formed and discharged for six weeks, and then closed. This was, therefore, a simple cyst, formed in the cellular membrane, containing a considerable quantity of a serous secretion. We have, in the collection at St. Thomas’s Hospital, a large globular hydatid, which Mr. Cline informed me was discharged from the breast. It appears then, as I have stated, that there are three kinds of hydatid or encysted tumours in the breast. One, in which the production is a globular hydatid, like that which is considered to be a distinct animal, and which is now and then met with in diffe- rent parts of the human body; the second, a cyst composed of numerous lamellae like the crystalline humour; and the other, a bag containing serum, and probably produced by an adhesive process shutting the communication between the cells of the cellular tissue, in which secretion proceeds.

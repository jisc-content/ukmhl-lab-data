PLATE XIV. Fig. 1. Shews the dislocation of the tibia inwards at the ancle-joint. a, Malleolus internus of the tibia thrown on the inner side of the astragalus. b, A portion of the tibia split off. c, Fibula broken. d, Broken portion of the tibia adhering by ligament to the fibula. e, Malleolus externus of the fibula, with the broken portion of the tibia adhering to it. f, Astragalus thrown outwards. Fig. 2. Fracture of the patella, with ligamentous union and great separation of the bone. The extent of separation depends upon the degree of lace- ration of the capsular ligament, and of the tendons of the vasti externi muscles which are spread over it. a, Upper portion of the patella drawn up by the action of the rectus and vasti. b, The lower portion of bone. c to a, Original ligament. c to b, New ligament, which from its length excessively di- minished the power of the extensor muscles.

As the patient should be in the sitting position at the time of the operation, the lower part of the chest should be selected between the seventh and eighth, or eighth and ninth ribs, and the opening should be made rather posteriorly to the side of the thorax, so as to completely avoid the diaphragm. The skin being drawn up an inch, an incision is to be made through it upon the upper edge of the rib; after which, the intercostal muscles are carefully divided ; and a straight canula closed at its end like a catheter, but having holes in its sides, is then passed through the pleura, and the pus is allowed to escape through it. When the matter has been thus evacuated, the canula is removed, and the skin being let go, the external and internal wounds are no longer opposite to each other, and union is more readily effected. The reason for making the incision upon the upper edge of the rib is to avoid the intercostal artery, which is placed in a groove in its lower margin. This operation I have known succeed, although it is generally unsuccessful. A Mr. Bryant, in the city of London, had this operation performed upon him, by Sir B. Harwood, and he ultimately recovered. Collections of pus in the thorax are sometimes partial, and then the disease is called spurious empyema. An adhesion forms between the pulmonary and costal portions of the pleura, between which also matter becomes deposited, so that the general cavity of the chest is excluded from the accumulation. This abscess ulcerates the intercostal muscles, and breaks externally, after having been the occasion of excessive pain, dyspnoea, and cough. A boy, who had been a long time at sea, and who had been very much the subject of sea-scurvy, was sent to my house by his mother, on account of a large accumulation of matter upon the

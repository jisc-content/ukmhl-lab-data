SUPERFICIAL FASCIA OF THE CORD 264 â€¢ore not obedient to the mind; but they result from changes of temperature, and therefore seem to depend upon the lessened diameters of the arteries and veins of the part, and of the diminished quantity of blood which they contain. CELLULAR TISSUE OF THE SCROTUM. Cellular tissue Within the scrotum a long loose reticular membrane is found, which proceeds from the inner side of the integuments to the external covering of the spermatic cord and testis. Nature has formed it rather reticular than adipose, to prevent any increase of bulk under corpulency. It is long and loose, to permit of great freedom of motion in the testis, and to enable it to elude the influence of violence. Opposite to the raphe it is more condensed than at any other part, and it is there named the septum scroti; although it is not truly a septum, for it is permeable to air and water; and when the scrotum is oedematous, the dropsical effusion passes through the septum, so that the whole of the reticular membrane is distended. From the septum scroti, reticular fibres pass to the covering of the testis, to preserve each testis in its situation. The septum scroti is supplied with blood from the pcrinaeal artery, and that vessel anastamoscs freely with the external pudic. When the testis, in a diseased state, adheres to the septum, these vessels are greatly enlarged, and often furnish a troublesome hemorrhage, if each divided vessel be not secured in a ligature. SUPERFICIAL FASCIA' OF THE CORD. Superficial ^ hen the scrotum, and the cellular tissue with which it is lined, arc removed, the spermatic cord appears covered with this fascia, which also descends to the testicle. It first proceeds from the surface of the tendon of the external oblique muscle of the abdomen, which it covers, and it is joined to the edges of the external

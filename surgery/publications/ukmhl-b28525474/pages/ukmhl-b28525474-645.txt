PLATE I. The first figure in this Plate is intended to shew the insertions of the external oblique muscles, the formation of the abdominal rings, and of two of the fasciae which are connected with Poupart’s ligament, as well as the course of the spermatic cord under the edges of the internal oblique and transverse muscles, before it reaches the abdominal ring. Fig. 1. a, Symphysis pubis. b b, Anterior and superior spinous process of the ilium. c c, External oblique muscles. d, Linea alba extending down to the symphysis pubis, and formed by the union of the tendinous fibres of the two ob- lique and transverse muscles. c e, Lineae semilunares, formed by the union of the tendinous fibres of the external and internal oblique and transverse muscles. ff, The abdominal rings formed by the separation of two co- lumns of tendinous fibres; the upper inserted at a into each os pubis; the lower inserted into the pubes at h, after passing behind the spermatic cord. g, The origin of some tendinous fibres which proceed from the anterior spinous process of the ilium, and crossing the columns of tendon, assist in uniting them above the abdo- minal ring. i i, Poupart’s ligament, or the crural arch, which is extended from the anterior spinous process of the ilium at b, to the pubes at h, receiving the lower column of tendon, which forms a part of the abdominal ring, and which passes be- hind the cord to be inserted from the spinous process to the crest of the pubes. k, The fascia lata of the thigh, which is continued from Pou- part’s ligament, and seen turning in under the femoral ves- sels near the middle of the fore part of the thigh.

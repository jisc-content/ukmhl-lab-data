FRACTURES OF TIIE UPPER PART OF THE THIGH-BONE. 317 of its phosphate of lime, had dried away in several parts, and the appearance was such that a person, ignorant of the change, would have declared it to be a fracture ; only, that in some sections the cartilage had taken different directions, and in some the bone was not yet entirely absorbed. There is also in the Museum of St. Thomas’s Hospital, a skeleton in which both the thigh-bones, and each os humeri, are, in a subject extremely altered by rickets, divided by similar portions of cartilage, in which no ossific matter ,exists. I have been led to prosecute the inquiry by experiments upon animals. I found it difficult to succeed in breaking the bone in the direction I wished, and, after a great number of experiments, was successful only in the following instances; the preparations of these I have preserved, and they may be seen in the Museum at St. Thomas’s Hospital. Experiment I. j The neck of the thigh-bone was fractured in a rabbit, on October 28th, 1818; and on December 1st, 1818, as the wound had been iome time healed, I dissected the animal. Appearance on dissection.—The capsular ligament was much hickened; the head of the bone was entirely disunited from ts neck, but adhered by a new ligamentous substance to the ,;apsular ligament; the broken cervix, which was very much hortened, played on the head of the bone, and had smoothed It by attrition ; the head of the thigh-bone had not undergone any issific change. Experiment II. The neck of the thigh-bone was broken in a dog, November 8th, 1818, and the animal was killed on the 14th of December ollowing. Dissection.—The trochanter was much drawn up by the action f the muscles, so that the head and cervix femoris were not

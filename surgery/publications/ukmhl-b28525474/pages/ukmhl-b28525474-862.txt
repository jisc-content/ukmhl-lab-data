186 LACERATED ARTERIES. When an artery is not completely divided, its retraction is pre- vented, and a coagulum, with difficulty, forms in it, and, when formed, is easily forced off by the action of the heart. Hence, in a week or ten days after the injury, bleeding will sometimes occur; and repeated haemorrhage will destroy the patient if a ligature be not applied. I have known the temporal artery bleed eleven days after its partial division, and when the wound in the integument was almost closed. The treatment of this injury consists in completely dividing the vessel, when its retraction enables a coagulum to form in, and around it; but, if the artery be large, a ligature must be applied. LACERATED ARTERIES. Case. Case. Cheseltlen’s case. Causes which prevent bleed- ing. These bleed comparatively little. A sailor, on board a Margate Packet, was bringing up his vessel in the river, and having his leg in a coil of the cable, the anchor was unexpectedly let go, when the cable caught his thigh, and tore off his leg six inches above the knee, excepting that a small portion of skin still connected the parts externally; the bone was broken; the artery, vein, sciatic nerve, and muscles, were all completely separated. A handkerchief was bound around the wound, and he was brought to Guy’s Hospital. The artery had'1 ceased to bleed, but he had lost a considerable quantity of blood. I amputated his limb, and he proceeded favourably for ten days, when he was seized with tetanus, and died. I have also seen the foot torn off above the ancle, and the bleed- ing stop without the aid of tourniquet or ligature. The case related by Cheselden, of the arm being torn off al 1 the shoulder without much haemorrhage, is known to every sur- geon. There are two causes which operate to prevent bleeding:— 1. The cellular tissue is sometimes drawn over the mouth of the vessel, and makes a ligature upon it, which stops the blood. 2. Another state of the artery produces the same result, and ii j

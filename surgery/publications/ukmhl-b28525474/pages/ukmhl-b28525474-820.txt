The danger in this operation is of wounding the intestine, as there is not any vessel of importance that can be injured. OF VENTRAL HERNIA. This hernia only differs from the umbilical in its seat, which is usually at the linea alba, or linea semilunaris ; but any visceral protrusion at the anterior, or lateral parts of the abdomen, except those already described, may be called ventral herniae. The symptoms of this form of hernia are usually the same as those of the umbilical, excepting when the hernia is formed be- tween the umbilicus and ensiform cartilage in the linea alba, and contains a portion of the stomach, when peculiar symptoms will arise. I once saw a gentleman with a hernia in this situation, who suf- fered constantly from indigestion, flatulency, and a distressing sens- ation of sinking at the scrobiculus cordis. His hernia was, how- ever, reducible, and the application of a truss relieved all his un- pleasant symptoms. The following causes may give rise to this hernia :â€” 1. A natural deficiency of tendinous structure, which I hav< known to a very considerable extent, in the linea alba or linea se milunaris. 2. The apertures for the passage of blood-vessels being un usually large. 3. Injuries by which the continuity of the parietes is destroyed. The coverings of ventral hernia are generally the same as thos of the umbilical disease ; viz., the integument, superficial fascia and peritoneal sac ; but, in some instances, I have found anothe covering connected with the edge of the opening in the tendoi through which the hernia escapes. When this hernia occurs in consequence of wound, the covering must, of course, vary.

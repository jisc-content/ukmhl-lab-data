161 ON COMPRESSION OF THE BRAIN. before its usual time; during the night, the servant was awoke by the apoplectic stertor of the child, which prevented her from sleeping; when she moved it, the child was not roused; she discovered that it was ill, alarmed the family, and at eight in the morning it died: it was found after death, that a considerable quantity of blood was extravasated in the brain.

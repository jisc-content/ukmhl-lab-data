These wounds we shall divide, as wounds in general, into the In- cised, Lacerated, Contused, and Punctured. When an artery is cut into, or divided, the immediate effect of such injury is to occasion an impetuous haemorrhage of florid blood, which, if the artery be large, whizzes through the wound. It flows in pulsation in obedience to the action of the heart. If the wounded orifice, nearest to the heart, be compressed, the blood from the opening, most remote from the heart, flows in an uninterrupted stream, and is of a dark venous colour, owing to its ! having passed through capillary vessels. The brain soon ceases to be supplied with blood, and fainting is produced: sensation and volition become suspended; and the action of the heart is in a great degree suppressed; the flow of blood from the wound becomes much diminished, and sometimes entirely ceases. In a few minutes the patient opens his eyes, and the power of - the nervous system is restored. The mode by which bleeding is arrested may be either con- â–  stitutional or local. Fainting is the constitutional mode, by sus- , pending the voluntary and involuntary functions, more especially in the diminution of the action of the heart, so that the blood scarcely reaches the wound, but it undulates in the heart, and large vessels under the fluttering of the heart. The local means consist in, first, the coagulation of the blood, which is effected in the cellular tissue around the artery, and also in the extremity of the wounded vessel, forming a plug; so that there is a continuation of coagulum from the outer surface to the j orifice, and this sufficiently opposes the issue of blood under the enfeebled action of the heart.

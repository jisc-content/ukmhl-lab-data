Less frequent than formerly. Improved treatment of compound fractures and dislocations. Of aneurisms and diseases of joints. The removal of constituent parts of the body becomes necessary from different causes, but such operations are much less frequently performed at present than they were thirty years ago. The improved treatment of compound fractures renders it rarely necessary to amputate a limb for those accidents.

There will, however, be cases in which an operation will be occasionally required for one of these accidents. An aneurism in a limb, for which, forty years ago, amputation of the limb was frequently performed, is now, by the simple operation invented by Mr. Hunter, readily and effectually cured. The simple

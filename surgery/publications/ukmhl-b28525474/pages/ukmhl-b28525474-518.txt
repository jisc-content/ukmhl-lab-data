OF CALCULI IN THE PROSTATE GLAND. 402 Meatus to be enlarged. Preparations in the Museum at St.Thomas’s Hospital. Found in two situations. Do not acquire a large size. Forceps cannot be introduced effectually, because they open in the urethra before the stone, but cannot be passed over it. It is better to enlarge the meatus with a lancet, to free the passage of the stone, rather than risk the laceration of the parts from violence. In the collection at St. Thomas’s Hospital I have two preparations, showing calculi wdiich have ulcerated their way into the urethra. One, a stone of the form and size of the little finger, and slightly curved, which I cut from a young man who had a fistula in perineo: with a probe I felt the end of a calculus through the fistulous opening, and therefore made an incision and extracted it; its anterior extremity was in the membranous portion of the urethra, its posterior in the bladder. In the other preparation, the stones are seen partly in the prostatic part of the urethra, passing there by ulceration. I have twice known a stone in the urethra destroy life by occasioning an extravasation of urine into the scrotum. LECTURE XXXII. OF CALCULI IN THE PROSTATE GLAND. I separate these from urinary calculi, because they are formed independent of that secretion, and they differ generally in their component materials from urinary calculi. I have found them in two situations in the prostate: first, several calculi,-each seated in a separate small duct; secondly, numerous calculi placed together in a cyst or bag in the substance of the gland. They rarely acquire any considerable size; the largest I have seen not being bigger than a pea, and they seldom are so large; but their numbers are sometimes very considerable. I was called by Mr. George Vaux, to see a Mr. Lewis, in the Old Jewry, wrho had retention of urine, and in w'hom there was Case.

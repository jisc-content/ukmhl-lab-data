233 OF WOUNDS OF THE NERVES. a dog, without producing any other symptom than partial pa- ralysis. I removed from the median nerve, a tumour for a gentleman, Case, and took away two-thirds of the nerve with it, and numbness with tingling were the only unpleasant symptoms following. A Mr. H. called at my house, who had a partial division of the Case, median nerve, affecting the fore, middle, and ring fingers, but not i the thumb ; he had tingling with the numbness, but no other bad !symptom. A nerve divided in part, therefore, occasions tingling and numb- ness ; one completely separated, only numbness : the treatment of the former is as that of the latter. If a ligature be applied upon a nerve of magnitude, the conse- Ligature on a quences are sometimes fatal, and sometimes productive of lingering nei'L‘ suffering. Mr. Cline informed me, that in a case of popliteal aneurism, Case, operated upon in the old way, by opening the tumour in the ham, ithe popliteal nerve was included in the ligature with the artery, and the man died in a few hours. In a case of amputation at Guy’s Hospital, I saw the whole Case, sciatic nerve included in a ligature, which was applied to suppress haemorrhage from the artery which accompanies the nerve. In four days, the man was seized with violent spasm in the stump. On the fifth day, spasms affected the limb, and from thence ex- tended to the other muscles of the body. On the seventh day, he died. If a nerve be included in a ligature, when tying an artery, the process of ulceration is extremely slow% and the slightest drawing of the ligature produces agonizing pain. Lord Nelson suffered excessively from this cause after his limb Case, had been amputated ; and with all his heroism, he could not bear the least touch of the ligature, without uttering the most violent expressions. After amputation, then, it is right to avoid, with the greatest cir-

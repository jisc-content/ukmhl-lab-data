Previous to the operation, the patient should be directed to empty his bladder, and the integument upon the tumor and sur- rounding parts, must be cleansed from the hair usually cover- ing it. The patient is then to be placed upon a table, about three feet six inches in height, on his back, the shoulders should be raised, and the thighs a little flexed towards the body, so as to relax the abdominal muscles ; the hams are to be brought to the edge of the table, so that the legs may be allowed to hang over it.

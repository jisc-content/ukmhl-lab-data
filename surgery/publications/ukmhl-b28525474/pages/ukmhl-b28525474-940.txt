r PLATE XI. Shewing the positions of the limb in the different dislocations of the hip, and in the fracture of the cervix femoris. Fig. 1. The dislocation upwards upon the dorsum ilii. The limb shortened—the hip projecting—the knee and foot turned inwards, with the toes resting over the metatarsus of the sound limb. Fig. 2. The dislocation downwards into the foramen ovale. The limb lengthened—the knee advanced and separated from the other—the toes pointed—the heel does not touch the ground—the body bent forward. Fig. 3. The dislocation into the ischiatic notch. The limb short- ened—the knee and foot a little turned inwards, with the great toe resting against the ball of the great toe of the sound limb. Fig. 4. The dislocation on the pubes. Projection at Poupart’s ligament from the head of the bone, the limb widely sepa- rated from the other, and the knee and foot turned out- wards—the limb a little shortened. Fig. 5. Fracture of the cervix femoris. The leg is shorter, the knee turned out; the patella from one to two inches above the other; foot everted : the limb may be extended to the same length as the other, and then, if rotated, a crepitus will be felt.

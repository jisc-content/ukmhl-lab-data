346 Alterative medicines. Pressure. Its removal operation. TREATMENT. As the disease is founded in a constitutional change, and in specific local action, the objects in the treatment will be to correct the general health, and to destroy the local and specific action. The first is to be attempted by the alterative medicines already recommended, viz. Pil. hyd. subm. comp, and a bitter infusion with rhubarb and soda. But we are at present entirely unacquainted with any constitu- tional means, or local application, which has influence over the disease when it has once been manifested. Pressure has been used to produce a slough of the fungus, and it is proper to give it a trial; but it is acting only upon the effect, and will not prevent a fatal termination, as the cause will still remain. Aluminous applications are useful in preventing the growth of the fungus, and the sulphate of iron has a good effect in the same point of view; but I know of nothing which has a specific action upon the sore. It is therefore necessary to remove this disease by operation; and, upon the whole, it less frequently returns than the scirrhous tubercle, if care be taken to extend the operation properly into the sound parts. The operation presents none of those difficulties which have been described ; for it has been said that the vessels are large, and that they bleed so profusely as to occasion dangerous haemorrhage. It is true, in the swelling they are large; but the arteries of the sur- rounding parts are but little augmented, and I have never seen any dangerous bleeding from their division. It is certain that the veins particularly, and the arteries of the part, if cut, bleed freely; but they ought not to be divided in the operation, which should be extended beyond its limits : they bleed not only from their size, but from the difference in their structure, having little contractile power.

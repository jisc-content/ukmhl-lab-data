152 OF THE PERINEAL HERNIA. Case. rectum, and the mouth of the sac was about two inches and a half from the anus. The following curious case is taken from Mr. Bromfield’s Chi- rurgical Observations:— “ A lad, between six and seven years of age, was put under my care to be cut for the stone. The staff, in the attempt to introduce it into the bladder, met with resistance from a stone, which seemed to be lodged in the membranous part of the urethra, or a little lower down in the neck of the bladder. I made my incision, as usual, through the integument and muscles, to get at the grove of the staff; and then pressed the blade of my knife into the sulcus, i at the extremity of the staff, being able to divide only the mem- branous part of the urethra; and a very small portion, if any, of the prostate gland; by the examination of the parts, with my « fingers, I then found that this hard body was a process continued 1; from the body of the stone contained in the bladder; I therefore I took the double gorgeret, without the cutting blade affixed, in- is tending only to push back the stone, and dilate the neck of the It; bladder, which I did by getting the beak of the gorgeret into the it sulcus of the staff, and pressing it against the point of the stone, It following its course with the instrument as the stone retired: but k the direction that the gorgeret took alarmed me, as it passed under is the ossa pubis with great obliquity. I then concluded that the in- I strument had taken a wrong route, as I could not, in this case, it have the advantage of the grove of the staff farther than the ex- | ( tremity of the membranous part of the urethra ; but, on withdraw- i ing the upper part of the gorget, I introduced the fore-finger of my right hand into the bladder, by the under part of the instru- ment, which remained in the bladder, and was now no more than the common gorgeret; by which I was soon convinced that it was in the bladder, the situation of which was raised much higher in the pelvis than usual. I then introduced my forceps, and, while I was searching for the stone, a thin diaphanous vesicle, like an hy- datid, appeared rather below my forceps, which, in the child's screaming, soon burst, discharged a clear water, as if forced from

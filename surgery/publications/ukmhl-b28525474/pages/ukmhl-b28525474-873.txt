197 WOUNDS OF PARTICULAR ARTERIES. different intervals the bleeding was frequently renewed, and I was at length compelled to amputate his limb. Upon examining it afterwards, a spicula of bone was found penetrating the anterior tibial artery, and the opening into the vessel thus produced, had been enlarged by a process of ulceration, so as to give rise to the haemorrhage. When the anterior tibial artery is wounded low down in the leg, Opt ration, it must, when it is tied, be completely raised from the tendons of the tibialis anticus, and extensor proprius pollicis, between which I it is placed; both ends must be secured. This artery is sometimes wounded on the upper part of the foot, 0,1 tl,e dorsum where it is placed upon the navicular bone, and the middle cunei- ° l c f°ot' form, by a knife or chisel being dropped upon the foot. Each extremity of the divided vessel must be carefully tied, other- wise the haemorrhage will continue, on account of the free anasto- mosis of this artery with the plantar. OF THE PLANTAR ARTERIES. For a wound of either of these arteries, I should first try what Treatment, lie application of a bandage, with a compress upon the wound, ind a tourniquet upon the thigh would effect, and should tie the losterior tibial artery, after an extended and unsuccessful trial of hese means; for so deeply is the artery placed, and so situated imongst tendinous parts and nerves, that incisions should not be nade at the wounded part. STYPTICS. In bleeding from small vessels on wounded surfaces, very fine Wool, vool, laid down and confined by bandage upon the part, is one of he best styptics. The wool may be dipped in flour to add to 1 ts efficacy. ' Turpentine is said to have power as a styptic, and I have seen Turpentine. Ileedings stopped by it when it has been applied by lint, and with

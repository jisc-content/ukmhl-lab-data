Granger, Esq., Pro- fessor of Anatomy at the Webb-street School, for the following method of dissecting the parts forming hernia. Ed.] Before proceeding to the dissection of the parts connected with hernia, it is necessary to examine the external configuration of the abdomen, and to consider how far the structure of that cavity may influence the protrusion of its contents. In making this ex- amination reference must be had to the influence of position; for it is evident, that as the upright posture is that in which the viscera escape, we shall acquire only very imperfect ideas of the conformation of the abdomen, if the body be merely regarded when placed, as it is, for the purposes of dissection, supine. If then we observe the erect body in profile, it will be seen that in consequence of the projection of the lumbar vertebrae, the axis of the abdomen is thrown obliquely forward, whilst that of the pelvis recedes ; so that the contents of the former cavity are ne- cessarily inclined against the anterior and lower part of the parietes, or in other words, against that particular part of the abdominal walls, where, from the existence of certain apertures, the resist- ance is least. This natural prominence of the abdomen is re- markably increased in obesity ; and this alteration is one among the other changes attendant on that state, which predisposes to the formation of hernia. We may next remark that the division between the abdomen

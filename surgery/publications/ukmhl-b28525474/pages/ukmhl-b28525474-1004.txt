320 FRACTURES OF THE UFPF.R FART OF THE THIOII-BONE. Longitudinal fracture. “ Is this the explanation of the greater shortening in the one fracture than in the other? “Nothing can better explain the want of ossific union than the principle you have laid down.” Having by experiment verified the result I have mentioned I was next anxious to learn if the head and neck of the thigh-bone would unite under a longitudinal fracture, partly within and parti) external to the capsular ligament, in which apposition, contact and., pressure are maintained; and for this purpose I made the follow- ing experiment. Experiment III. I divided the head, neck, and a portion of the trochanter majoi of the thigh-bone of a dog longitudinally, by placing a knife on the trochanter major, and striking it down towards the ace- tabulum through the head of the bone. The animal was killed twenty-nine days after, and the following appearances presented themselves. A portion of the trochanter major had been broken off, and was only united by cartilage. The head and neck of the bone, which lit had been longitudinally broken, were united ; the neck by a larger, ( quantity of ossific deposit than that which joined the separated portions of the head of the bone, and so irregularly as to make a n beautiful preparation, and shew the circumstance most clearly. This bone may be seen in the collection at St. Thomas’s Hos- pital. Whether the union began in the fracture externally to the liga- ment, and proceeded inwards, or whether on the whole surface at once, it is impossible to ascertain; but the coalescence was firm; although, as I have stated, I thought more so at the neck than at the head of the bone. The union in this case is readily ex- plained. Apposition was supported ; the vessels of the head of the 1 bone and cervix remained whole ; and, therefore, this experiment shews at once why the longitudinal unites, and the transverse, in general, does not unite.

OF THE REDUCIBLE INGUINAL HERNIA, 62 dominal muscles, any descent or tendency to protrusion exist at the internal ring. EXPLANATION OF PLATE VI. Shews trusses of different constructions for the support of in- guinal and femoral hernia. Fig. 1. Salmon and Ody’s self-adjusting truss. The right pad moves by means of a ball and socket, and is applied to the hernia; the hip pad is of a more rounded form, and is intended for the sacrum. They are connected by a strong steel spring. 1 Fig. 2. Is an anterior view of the same truss applied to a left in- guinal hernia. The spring embraces the opposite side to that on which the hernia is seated, and crosses the pubes to fix the pad upon the rupture ; it is hence called the op- posite-sided truss. Fig. 3. Posterior view of the same truss: the mode of applying the pad to the lower part of the spine is shewn. In this truss no circular or thigh strap is required. Fig. 4. Represents the two apertures through which an oblique hernia descends, and the situation of the epigastric artery; below Poupart’s ligament, on the left side, is pointed out the part on which a truss should be applied for a femoral hernia. Fig. 5. Oblique hernia passing through the inguinal canal upon the right side, and appearing through the external ring as a scrotal hernia. On the left side is seen a direct inguinal hernia which passes on the inner or pubic side of the epi- gastric artery, and protrudes only at the external ring. The oblique course of that on the right side, shews the necessity of wearing a truss that makes pressure on the inguinal canal, especially in the incipient state of a hernia.

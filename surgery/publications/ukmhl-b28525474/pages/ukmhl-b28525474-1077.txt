DISLOCATIONS OF THE ANCLE-JOINT. 385 The circumstances which I have known to create this necessity are,â€” I. The advanced Age of the Patient. At an advanced age the powers of the body become so much Age. weakened, that the patient is unable to bear the constitutional ex- i citement which the suppurative inflammation of the joint produces; and as amputation does not expose him to this process, it is better . to have recourse to that operation. However, I ought to observe, 1 that when in my lectures I stated what I have now advanced, the pupils flocked around me after lecture, and have told me of cases of recovery, even of very old persons ; but in the practice of hos- i pitals in this great metropolis, very aged persons sink under these accidents, if the limb be not amputated. | 2. A very extensive lacerated Wound mill give rise to a necessity This circumstance, however, is rather a motive for removing the Difficult reduc- extremities of the bones by the saw, than for performing amputa- tlon' tion; after which removal, the reduction of the tibia is easily effected, and a useful limb is preserved to the patient. 4. The Bones are sometimes extremely shattered. If the lower extremity of the tibia be broken into small pieces, Bones shattered. ,the loose portions of bone ought to be removed, and the end of the tibia to be smoothed by a saw ; but if, in addition to this commi- nution, the lower extremity of the tibia be obliquely broken, and a large loose portion of bone be felt with the fingers, then it will be proper to amputate : also, if the astragalus be broken, the portions of this bone should be removed, otherwise they will separate by ulceration, or occasion considerable local irri- tation. But if the end of the tibia and the tarsal bones, as for this Operation. A difficulty in Reducing the Bones has been considered as a reason for Amputation. VOL. II. c c

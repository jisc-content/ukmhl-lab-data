42 ON HERNIA. Coverings of crural hernia. Seat of struc- ture. Importance of the subject. cess, which may be named the crural canal, is analogous to the inguinal canal, and the saphenous opening, by which the hernia reaches the surface of the body, resembles the external ring. The coverings of femoral hernia are, first, the skin, then the su- perficial fascia, below that the cribriform fascia, then the femoral sheath, and lastly, a little fatty cellular membrane, which, in old herniae, becomes very much thickened, and readily separates into several layers, that has by some been called the fascia propria. The seat of stricture in femoral hernia is either the upper part of the femoral sheath, the neck of the sac, or the falciform process of the fascia lata. In dividing the stricture, it is necessary to con- sider the position of the surrounding vessels. Immediately above the ring is situated, in the male the spermatic cord, in the female the round ligament; to the outer side, the epigastric artery ; and sometimes, though very rarely, the obturator artery is situated on the anterior and inner side of the sac; in that case the ring would be almost surrounded by blood-vessels ; this, however, is of very rare occurrence. Considering the usual relative position of the dif- ferent vessels to the ring, the safest mode of dividing the stricture is upwards and a lillle inwards. LECTURE XLI. ON HERNIA. This, of all the diseases to which the human body is liable, de- mands, upon the part of the surgeon, a large share of anatomical knowledge, great promptitude and decision, and the utmost skill and dexterity in the performance of an operation, when it is ren- dered necessary, by a defeat of the means employed for its re- duction. In other important cases, consultations may be held, or the patient be sent to a distance to obtain the advantage of the best opinions; but in hernia the fate of the patient is decided almost upon the instant, and an hourâ€™s delay may turn the scale of

In long- continued pain of the head, I sometimes make an incision in the scalp, and open an issue, for the purpose of supporting external irritation ; and have seen advantage arise from producing a slight exfoliation. LECTURE XVII. ON COMPRESSION OF THE BRAIN. We have to consider the causes which give rise to it, its symptoms, and the treatment which it requires. When a person is labouring under compression of the brain, it is known by the breathing being stertorous, the pulse slow, and the pupils dilated; to which may be added the symptoms of concussion; when you then find a patient with the apoplectic stertor, slow pulse, dilated pupils, it will generally happen that the brain is compressed. The causes w-hich produce compression are three:—1. Extrava- sation of blood; 2. Fracture with depression; 3. Formation of matter within the skull; these are the three causes which give rise to compression. We shall first consider compression when produced by extravasa- tion. Now, gentlemen, wheil the brain is compressed by extravasated blood, the symptoms do not directly occur; the person at the time of the injury is often stunned; recovers himself, and a short time after falls into a comatose state, and then the apoplectic stertor begins. I will relate to you a case to illustrate this:—A child was playing on a table, from which it fell on a stone floor, and received a severe blow on the head, which caused compression of the brain; the child appeared to recover at four in the afternoon, the time at which the accident occurred being one; pain still continued in the head, the child cried considerably; it went to bed about two hours

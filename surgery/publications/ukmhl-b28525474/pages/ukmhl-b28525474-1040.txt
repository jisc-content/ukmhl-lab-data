FRACTURES OF THE KNEE. 352 fifteenth day. The adhesive matter had acquired a smooth and somewhat ligamentous character. Experiment IV. The same division of the bone being made, it was examined on the twenty-second day, when the new ligament was complete. Experiment V. The same repeated in five weeks. The part was injected, and vessels were found proceeding from the edge of the ligament into the adhesive matter now become ligamentous. So that at the end of five weeks the vascularity is complete, and some vessels pro- ceed into the new ligament from the bone, but chiefly from the lacerated ligament. Upon the dog, these processes may be equally well observed ; but they are not quite so rapidly produced in a large dog as in the rabbit. The parts were dissected and preserved after these experiments, both in the dog and rabbit, and they are deposited in the collec- tion of St. Thomas's Hospital, where they may be always seen. Experiment VI. In the rabbit, having divided the bone, I sewed the two portions by conveying a needle and thread through the tendinous covering : of the bone ; but the ligatures separated, and the bones still united by ligament. Experiment VII. I divided the bone, and cut the rectus muscle across above it, yet the patella united by ligament. I could not, either in the dog or the rabbit, succeed in producing a bony union in the transverse fracture. Yet I once saw a patient of my kind friend, M. Chopart, at Paris,â€”a case which appeared to me to be united by bone ; and Mr. Fielding, of Hull, has lately published a similar case. A ligamentous union of the transverse fracture of the patella is that which generally occurs ; and if there be an exception, it is 'i!

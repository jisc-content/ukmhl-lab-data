425 OF SETON FOR FISTULA. OF INJECTIONS FOR FISTULA. Although, as it will be readily believed, I have seen a multitude the cure by J injection, of cases of fistula, I have only known two cured by injection, which were as follow: I was attending, with Mr. Pugh, surgeon, of Gracechurch Street, a lady, in Fenchurch Street, who had a fistula on each side of the anus. I opened one fistula, and cured it; but the patient would not submit to the operation upon the other. Mr. Pugh and I therefore agreed that we would try other means, and we injected into the sinus with oxymurias hydrargyri, the liquor calcis gr. 1. t ad 3j. and the sinus healed. The second case was a gentleman from the North, a friend of Case. Lord Harewood, who had been under the care of Mr. Hey, of Leeds, for a fistula on the right side of the anus, and who came to me for advice. The fistula was of great depth and distance from the rectum upon the opposite side. I feared opening it, both from the delicate health of the patient, and the danger of haemorrhage; and therefore I threw into the sinus equal parts of port wine and water. My nephew, Mr. Bransby Cooper, finding it did not bring on sufficient inflammation, injected port wine, undiluted, and thereupon inflam- mation followed; adhesion was produced, and the case terminated without further alteration. OF SETON FOR FISTULA. Timid persons prefer this mode of treatment to the knife, although Of the cure by in the one case the irritation is long continued, and in the other the seton* pain is only of a few minutes continuance. That it succeeds, in some instances, I have known; for some of my patients, having submitted to this remedy, returned to me well. My objection to it is, that the irritation it produces is liable to occasion other abscesses, whilst healing that for which it is employed.

150 OF PUDENDAL HERNIA. Course. Two hernia: in the same per- son. Operation difficult. Treatment. Its seat. Course. OF THE THYROIDEAL HERNIA, OR HERNIA FORAMINIS OVALIS. The first example of this disease which I saw, was accidentally discovered in a male subject, in whom an inguinal hernia also ex- isted on the same side. The parts are preserved in the collection at St. Thomasâ€™s Hospital. The hernia was protruded through the opening in the ligament of the foramen ovale, by which the obturator artery and nerve pass to the thigh; the pubes was immediately before the neck of the sac, and the ligament of the foramen embraced the other portion about three-fourths. The obturator vessels were situated behind, and somewhat to the inner side of the neck of the sac. The sac itself, not larger than a nutmeg, was placed under the heads of the pectineus and adductor brevis muscles. I lately had an opportunity of seeing two specimens of this hernia in the same subject, one existing on each side, which were not discovered during life. Several cases of this form of hernia are related in the first volume of the Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Surgeons at Paris. The depth at which this hernia is situated, would render an operation, in case of strangulation, extremely difficult; but, should such a step be necessary, I should recommend the division of the stricture inwards on account of the obturator artery, &c. If reducible, a truss, similar to that used for crural hernia, but with a thicker pad, would prevent its further descent. ta OF THE PUDENDAL HERNIA. This hernia appears in the external labium pudendi, about its middle. It commences at the side of the vagina, and passes into the la- bium between the vagina and ischium ; it has usually a pyramidal figure, and presents the characters of other herniae, as elasticity,

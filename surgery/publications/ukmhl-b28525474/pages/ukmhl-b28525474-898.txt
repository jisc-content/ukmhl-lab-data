WOUNDS OF THE THROAT. 222 I knew a lady who had a stricture in her oesophagus, who was supported forty-five days by clysters of broth and wine, when she could not swallow even a drop of water. When food is given by the mouth, a small quantity of solid mat- ter excites less irritation than fluid; and a small portion of jelly is the best. The sutures should be removed in a week, and adhesive plaister be substituted for them. When the wound is situated below the os hyoides, as it some- times is, the epiglottis is injured at its junction with the thyroid cartilage. In a case of this kind to which I was called at Walworth, I put a thread through the froenum, on the dorsom of the epiglottis, and fixed it again to the thyroid cartilage. The man recovered; but whether it was post hoc, or propter hoc, God knows! In ge- neral, those cases are fatal, in which the epiglottis is separated from the thyroid cartilage, from a want of defence to the air tube. OF THE W'OUND INTO THE LARNYX. Symptoms. This wound is either into the thyroid or cricoid cartilages, or into the ligament which unites them. The air rushes out through the wound in expiration, and vio- lently in coughing, and is also inspired through it. The person is not able to speak, unless the aperture be closed by pressure; but the food does not pass out from it. A wound confined to the cartilages of the larynx, or to the liga- ment uniting them, is not dangerous, and by far the greater num- ber of these cases, which I have seen, have done well. The treat- ment of them consists in approximation of the parts by position, and in the application of adhesive plaister to retain the edges in contact. When the wound is inflicted with excessive violence, or by a stab, the pharynx may be wounded, as it is situated behind the

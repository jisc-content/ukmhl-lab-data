200 OF THE TREATMENT OF WOUNDS OF VEINS. Position. Gentle pressure. Two kinds. First kind, often recovered from. stances, both artery and vein, in a stump, in a state of partial adhe- sion and suppuration. I saw, in Paris, in 1792, a case in which life was destroyed by suppuration of the femoral vein, after a gun-shot wound. OF THE TREATMENT OF WOUNDS OF VEINS. The first and greatest object is to empty the veins as much as possible, by the position of the limb, which should be such as to allow of the gravitation of the blood to the heart. In the arm, an inclined plane ; in the leg, the position for a fractured tibia. This prevents accumulation of blood, and distension of the vessels. Secondly, a roller from the extreme part of the limb, to the wound, wetted with the liquor plumbi subacetatis, and spirit should be applied to approximate the sides of the vein, and to make gen- tle pressure. Thirdly, leeches should be freely applied, and if suppuration be produced, fomentations. WOUNDS OF THE ABDOMEN. These injuries are of two kinds: 1. Those in which the cavity is opened, but the viscera are not wounded. 2. Those in which some of the viscera suffer. With respect to the first of these it is scarcely necessary to say, in the present state of surgical knowledge, that very extensive wounds of this description are often recovered from, as is proved by the operations for umbilical or ventral hernia, by the Cesarian section; and, recently, by the removal of enlarged ovaria*. But the most curious circumstance in these wounds, is the manner in which the intestines glide away from the sharpest instruments, and escape injury. I shall relate two cases:â€” < See cases by Mr. Liston.

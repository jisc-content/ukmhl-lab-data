DISLOCATIONS OF TIIE ANCLE-JOINT. 38G Dislocation outwards. Oblique fracture with dislocation. Division of an artery. the astragalus and os calcis, are broken, then amputation will be required. 5. The Dislocation of the Tibia at the Outer Ancle, Produces much more injury and danger than that at the inner, and amputation will be more frequently required for it, because both the bones and soft parts suffer more than in the dislocation inwards. 6. It sometimes happens, that when the Bone is replaced it mill not remain in its Situation, and all the Symptoms of the Injury be- come renewed. This circumstance arises when the tibia, in the dislocation out- wards, is obliquely broken; and as only a small portion of the articulating surface remains on the dislocated extremity of the tibia, it will not rest on the tibia when it is reduced. 7. The Division of a large Blood-vessel might, with an extensive Wound of the Integuments, lead to a necessity for Amputation. But I should not, on that account, at once proceed to the operation. The case from Mr. Sandford, of Worcester, sent me by Mr. Carden, clearly shews that the division of the anterior tibial artery does not, if it be well secured, prevent the patient’s recovery. I also once saw a compound fracture close to the ancle- joint, accompanied by a division of that artery ; yet, although the patient was in the hospital, and being a brewer’s servant possessed the worst constitution to struggle against severe injuries, this man recovered without amputation. The posterior tibial artery is a vessel of more importance, and is accompanied by a large nerve, which would not be likely to escape injury when the artery was divided by the dislocated bone. Yet the magnitude of the anterior tibial artery, and its free anastomosis with the posterior, would not entirely preclude the hope of preserving the foot under an injury of the posterior tibial artery.

306 DISSECTION. Symptoms. doubted if the testicle was subject to the disease to which the breast is so prone, viz. the scirrhus, which in its progress, produces cancer. I have seen few examples of that hard swelling in the testis which resembles scirrhus, and I have never seen but one instance in which that hardened testis ulcerated and destroyed the part, resembling in its progress the cancerous ulcer of the breast. Old persons are most liable to this disease ; in the few examples in which I thought the disease might be scirrhus, the age has been between fifty and seventy years. The symptoms have been, a slow increase of the testicle, a hard- ness which rendered the part almost impenetrable to pressure, occasional severe pain in the part extending towards the loins, the disease beginning in the testis at length extending to the epidi- dymis ; extremely slow in its progress; the surface of the testicle feeling tuberculated, irregular, knotted, and excessively hard ; the spermatic cord becoming gradually thickened; the body bent for- ward, or the thigh advanced; the leg and thigh, upon the affected side, swollen and oedematous; some water effused into the tunica vaginalis, so that the testis is felt through an hydrocele, a tumour at last forms in the loins, but never acquires the magnitude of that in the medullary disease, nor does the testis become so large in scirrhus as in the complaint before described. The patient sinks from impaired digestion, violent pain in the abdomen, and irregular state of the bowels. DISSECTION. When the testicle is cut open, the tunica vaginalis and tunica albuginea are thickened ; and, instead of the tubes which form the secreting structure of the testicle, a hard white mass is found, in lobes or tubercles, which are harder than the other parts, and in which cartilaginous and sometimes ossific matter are deposited. The epididymis has the same appearance, and some tubercles are found in the cord.

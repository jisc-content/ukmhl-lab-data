63 AND USE OF TRUSSES. j Fig. 6. Common inguinal hernia truss. Its spring encircles half the body, the circle being completed by a strap which is fastened to one of the studs on the long pad. This truss is well calculated for the working classes ; and may be ren- dered still more secure by a thigh strap to prevent the pad rising, as is seen in Fig. 10. Fig. 7. Double truss of the same construction. Fig. 8. Represents a posterior view of the common truss, Fig. 8, as worn for an inguinal hernia. Fig. 9. Anterior view of the same truss, applied to an inguinal rupture. When required for femoral hernia, the common truss is made with a somewhat larger pad, and the ex- tremity curved downwards so as to reach below Poupart’s ligament. Fig. 10. Anterior view of the common truss, applied to a double inguinal hernia. Egg’s truss differs from the common truss in having a nearly circular spring, and is well calculated to keep up'large ruptures which are capable of bearing strong pressure. Fig. 11. Represents Coles’s single truss for inguinal hernia on the right side. Fig. 12. Represents a double truss of Coles’s, constructed on the same principle, for inguinal hernia on each side. Fig. 13. Represents Coles’s half truss for umbilical hernia. Fig. 14. Is a representation of the spiral springs forming the pads, and covered with proper materials. These three last described trusses are capable of every modification, and are certainly the best calculated to pre- vent the descent of a hernia under any circumstance what- ever. The spring is formed with a view to combine the greatest degree of elastic power in the smallest space, and the spiral springs entering into the construction of the pads, gives them a decided superiority over every other truss yet offered to the public.

PREFACE. IV The Third and concluding Volume will contain Sir Astleyâ€™s Lectures on the Venereal Disease. Diseases of the Eye. Scrofula. Diseases of the Bones. Bums and Scalds. Neuralgia. Impotence. Animal and Vegetable Poisons. A Treatise on the Use and Application of Bandages, with many wood-cut illustrations. The Editor needs offer no apology in adding this last Treatise as a concomitant to the Surgical Works of Sir Astley Cooper, as every tyro in the profession must know that a judicious and well applied bandage will often effect a cure when every other remedy has failed.

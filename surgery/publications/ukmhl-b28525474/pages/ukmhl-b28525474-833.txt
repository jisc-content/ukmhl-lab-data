OF THE ISCHIATIC HERNIA. 157 into the peritoneum, which the fundus of the bladder causes to descend. The treatment consists in the application of a truss, similar to that which is worn in the common inguinal hernia, and in paying unremitting attention to the frequent and complete discharge of urine. When the hernia is small, and the bladder only has de- scended, the cure is easier than in a common hernia, being assisted by the contraction of the muscular coat of the bladder. But if it has drawn down the peritoneum, intestine, and omentum with it, it will then be as difficult to cure as common inguinal hernia. The vesical hernia only admits of cure by a gradual absorption, or an extreme elongation of the adhesions which unite the blad- der to the scrotum. I can hardly conceive the possibility of this hernia becoming strangulated, so as to really require an operation, unless a calculus has formed in the protruded part, and thus given rise to irritation, inflammation, and thickening of the parts. A vesical hernia may also be a consequence of a previously formed femoral hernia of the common kind ; for in a female of re- laxed fibre I once saw the bladder drawn quite close to the orifice of a femoral hernial sac. But the comparatively small size of the aperture in femoral hernia, and the unyielding nature of the parts which form it, explain the reason of its not being met with in practice. OF THE ISCHIATIC HERNIA. This is an extremely rare form of hernia; indeed, I have only Very rare, seen one specimen of it, for which I am indebted to my friend Dr. Jones, whose name is well known by his excellent work on haemorrhage. Dr. Jones having told me that he had inspected the body of a Case, patient who had died in consequence of the strangulation of a

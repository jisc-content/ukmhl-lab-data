83 INGUINAL HERNIA. A large hernia when completely strangulated, is more quickly fatal than a smaller one; but the latter more frequently requires the performance of an operation, on account of the greater firmness of the stricture. A hernia containing a portion of strangulated intestine alone, is more rapidly fatal than one containing omentum only; and that containing both intestine and omentum, takes a middle course be- tween the two above mentioned. When a hernia has existed for a long time, and becomes stran- gulated, the attempts at reduction will be more likely to succeed than if it were of recent formation; in the first instance, the parts are more easily relaxed, having been accustomed to repeated dila- tation ; while in the latter case, the powers of resistance are much greater. Also in very young, or very old persons, strangulated hernias are more frequently reduced, than when they occur at the middle period of life, during which the fibrous structure is firmer, and the muscular strength greater than at any other period. In very old persons, also, the strangulation is not so rapidly fatal; as long a period as twenty days has been known to elapse between the com- mencement of the symptoms, and the death of the patient. — EXPLANATION OF PLATE VII. This Plate represents on the right side a small oblique inguinal hernia, making its appearance at the internal ring, on the outer side of the epigastric artery; and on the left side a scrotal hernia, with its coverings displayed by dissection. a a. Fascia superficialis coming from the external abdominal ring, and forming the external investment of the hernia. At its upper part the transverse fibres of the external ring are seen. b b b. Cremaster muscle thickened—seen descending under the g 2 Small herniae more frequently require opera- tion. Intestinal hernia most dangerous. Old hernias most likely to be re- duced. Also in very old or young per- sons.

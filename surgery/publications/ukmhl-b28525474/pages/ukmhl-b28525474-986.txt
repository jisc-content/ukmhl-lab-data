302 FRACTURES OF THE UPPER PART OF THE THIGH-BONE. Situation of the trochanter major. Appearance in the erect position. Crepitus. flexion be outwards, it is accomplished with but little comparative suffering ; but if the thigh be directed towards the pubes, the act of bending the limb is with difficulty accomplished, and is attended with greater pain ; for the movement is easier or more difficult, in proportion as the neck of the bone is shorter or longer. In this accident the trochanter major is drawn up towards the ilium, but the broken neck of the bone attached to the trochanter is placed nearer the spine of the ilium than the trochanter itself, in which situation it afterwards remains ; and this alteration of posi- tion makes the trochanter project less on the injured side, because it is no longer supported by the neck of the bone, as in its natural state, but rests in close apposition with the edge of the acetabulum, and is, consequently, much more concealed than usual, until the muscles waste from the duration of the injury, when the trochanter can be distinctly felt upon the dorsum ilii; but there will be a greater or less projection according to the length of the fractured cervix attached. If doubt exists of the nature of the accident, let the patient be directed to stand by his bed-side, supported by an assistant, and to bear his weight upon the sound limb ; the surgeon then observes , the shortened state of the injured leg; the toes rest upon the 1 ground, but the heel does not reach it; the knee and foot are everted ; and the prominence of the hip is diminished. The least attempt to bear upon the injured limb is productive of pain, which seems to be occasioned by the tension of the psoas, iliacus, and ob- turator externus muscles in the attempt, as well as by the pressure of the broken neck of the bone against the interior surface of the capsular ligament. A crepitus like that which accompanies other fractures might be expected to occur in this accident, but it is not discoverable when the patient rests on his back with the limb shortened ; if, however, the leg be drawn down, so as to bring the limbs to the same length, and rotation be then performed, the crepitus will be observed, as the broken ends of the bone are thus brought into contact: but the rotation inwards most easily detects the fracture.

WOUNDS OF THE INTESTINES. 208 Tn operating for hernia;. was great encouragement to continue it, as the broth clysters were not only retained, but there was a proof of an absorption having taken place, by the secretion and evacuation of urine, which then began to be considerable. It is a generally received opinion, that clysters seldom pass beyond the valve of the colon: the contrary has indeed been observed in the volvulus or iliac passion, but in that case the natural action of the intestines is in- verted, and a violent degree of anti-peristaltic motion prevails ; in this case, however, the broth was thrown up in a very gradual man- ner ; and though, perhaps, it did not pass the valve of the colon, in the first instance, I am inclined to believe, from the sudden manner in which the absorption was afterwards carried on, that a gentle degree of anti-peristaltic motion took place, whereby it (the broth) was impelled to the smaller intestines; this will appear less sur- prising, when we consider, that, in the natural action, the first im- pulse is communicated by the stomach, in discharging the digested aliment at the pylorus, and continued through the intestines in de- termining the faeculent matter downwards: but here the natural action was suspended, the stomach was at rest, and there was no foreign matter to be discharged. “ The advantages to be derived from throwing up a supply of fluid, and supporting nature in this manner, in particular cases of morbid affections of the digestive organs, will readily occur to the attentive practitioner.” WOUNDS OF THE INTESTINES. In a small wound of the intestine, which I witnessed in strangu- lated hernia, under the operation, I pinched up the opening with a pair of forceps, and tied a thread around it; I then passed up the intestine to the mouth of the hernial sac, leaving the ligature to hang from the wound, and the patient recovered, but he had severe symptoms for several days. In a more considerable wound of the intestine, I should make an I^arge wounds.

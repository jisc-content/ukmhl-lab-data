35 7 FRACTURES OF THE KNEE. upon it in the longitudinal direction, having first drawn the integuments aside; and on the 12th of September following, I ex- amined the part, when I found the two portions of bone consider- ably separated from each other, and united by ligament. The Union by liga- cause was as follows :â€”when 1 had divided the bone, the knee be- exPen' came bent, the condyles of the os femoris pressed against the inner side of the patella, and thrust the parts asunder, and only a ligamentous union took place. Experiment II. August 2d, 1818, I broke in the same manner the patella of a rabbit and examined the parts on September 3d, when I found the two portions of bone widely separated, and united only by liga- mentous matter. I now began to think it impossible for the patella to unite by bone, but determined to make another experi- ment to determine this point. Experiment III. I divided the patella longitudinally in a dog, but took care that the division should not extend into the tendon above or to the ligament below it, so that there should be no separa- tion of the two portions. I examined it three weeks after, and found it united; no separation existing between the two Union by bone, portions *. Experiment IV. October, 1819. I divided the patella by a crucial fracture into four portions ; the two upper portions neither united with each other, nor with the bones below ; but the two lower portions be- came united by bone. It appears then, that under longitudinal and transverse fracture, a ligamentous union is generally produced, and that it arises * The bone was, under maceration, found united in part by bone, and in part by cartilage, not completely ossified. It is preserved, and may be seen at any time by those who are curious to examine it.

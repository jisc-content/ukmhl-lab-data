ANATOMY OF HERNIA. 18 Bones. The distance between the symphysis pubis and the anterior su- I perior spinous process of the ilium, is from five and a half to six i inches, and if a line be drawn from one of these points to the 1 other, the space beneath it will be bounded for half its length by s the body of the pubes, and half by the ilium. About an inch and i a quarter from the symphysis pubis, (in the dried bone,) upon its anterior and upper part, is situated the tuberosity of the pubes, ' or, as it has been improperly called, its spinous process. From this s process a line is seen to extend obliquely backward and outwards f along the upper part of the pubes, as far as its junction with the i ilium ; this line is called the linea ilio-pectinea, and assists in 1 forming the brim of the pelvis. I About an inch and a quarter on the outer side of the tuberosity li of the pubes, is a natural depression on the upper part of the bone, a formed for the lodgement of the femoral artery, vein, and ab- i o sorbents, which, upon its outer side, is bounded by a projection, I marking the junction of the os pubis and ilium, and extending over c the acetabulum. ' n On examining that part of the ilium which forms the outer c boundary of the space mentioned above, it will be found, that two inches below the anterior superior spinous process, is situated another similar projection, called the anterior inferior spinous; and, that between the two, is a depression about an inch and a quarter in extent; immediately below the latter process is the o acetabulum, and an inch anterior to it, is a flat surface extending to the os pubis. It will be seen on dissecting the soft parts that fill up the space between the ilium and pubes, that they are wonderfully and beau- tifully adapted to the purpose for which they are designed ; but it must be acknowledged, that their intricate connections render them of all parts in anatomy the most difficult to investigate, and to describe with perspicuity. Ligament of the The os pubis is covered by a ligamentous expansion, which forms i p,lbes" a remarkably strong production above the linea ilio-pectinea, ex- tending from the tuberosity of the pubes outwards, and projecting

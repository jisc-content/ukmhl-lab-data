The following cases are important, and place in a strong light the dreadful constitutional effects which occasionally result from very slight local causes. A man who had lived intemperately, was bled by the late Mr. Case. Saunders on a Tuesday; on Thursday (having indulged in the interim in the pleasures of the table) the wound in the arm was inflamed; on the Saturday the inflammation had considerably in- creased; on the Sunday gangrene commenced; and on the Monday, I was asked to see him. I found him with the delirium, hiccough, andsubsultus tendinum; and on the following day he died.

Dr. Ludlow, of Caine, whilst shooting, pricked his hand with a Case, thorn in getting over a hedge; the part soon became inflamed, and though he procured the best surgical assistance, yet he died of tetanus within a week after the accident.

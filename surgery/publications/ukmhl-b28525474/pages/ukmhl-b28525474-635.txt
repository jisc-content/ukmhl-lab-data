TIIE PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE SURGERY. OF HERNIA. LECTURE XXXIX. GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF HERNIA. A protrusion of any viscus from its proper cavity is denominated a hernia. The protruded parts are generally contained in a bag, formed by the membrane with which the cavity is naturally lined. Several parts of the body afford examples of this disease. A deficiency in the bones of the head will sometimes allow the pro- trusion of part of the brain and its membranes, from the inner to the outer side of the scull, forming a hernia of this organ. An imperfect state of the intercostal muscles may permit part of the lung, with its pleura, to form an external tumour, or hernia of the contents of the chest. But the disease most frequently occurs about the cavity of the abdomen; and on this account, as well as from its superior im- portance in a surgical point of view, I shall confine my observations to this species, with its several varieties. Many reasons may be assigned for the very frequent occurrence of protrusions from the abdomen. First: The viscera of this cavity are numerous, some of them very moveable, and others loosely connected by peritoneal attach- ments with the surrounding parts; and they are constantly ex- posed to changes of size and relative situation, from sudden or gradual distention. Secondly : The parietes of the abdomen are composed of muscles i which, when in action, contract the dimensions of this cavity, corn- VOL. II. R Definition. Encephalic hernia. Thoracic. Abdominal.

99 TREATMENT AFTER THE OPERATION. The sac contained both intestine and omentum; and the latter, although much changed in appearance, was returned into the abdomen. Some days after the operation, the man appeared to be dying; the ligatures, holding the edges of the wound together, were removed, and poultices and fomentations employed, when, on the following day, a portion of gangrenous omentum was found protruding from the wound, and for several days more continued to present itself, until the whole of the portion which had been previously strangulated was exposed, and gradually sloughed off; after which the patient recovered. When the omentum alone adheres to the sac, it may be freely separated and returned, any vessels likely to afford a troublesome haemorrhage being previously secured. Should the protruded omentum be much hardened, or have a scirrhous feel, it should also be removed in the same manner as I have already described. TREATMENT AFTER THE OPERATION. When the contents of the hernial sac have been returned into the cavity of the abdomen, the wound should be well cleansed, and its edges should be afterwards brought into contact by means of sutures, in order to promote adhesion; two or three sutures being necessary, according to the extent of the wound. Care should be taken in passing these sutures only to include the integument, otherwise, by penetrating the sac, much subsequent mischief may arise. The approximation of these parts should be assisted by the ap- plication of slips of soap plaister, and a compress should be placed over the wound, and retained there by means of a T bandage, to close the orifice of the sac, and prevent any further protrusion into it, and at the same time the scrotum should be well supported. The patient should then be carried to bed in a horizontal po- h 2 Omentum adherent. Omentum hard like scirrhus. Employment of sutures. Of plaister. Position in bed.

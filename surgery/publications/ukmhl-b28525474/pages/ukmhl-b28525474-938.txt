262 PARTICULAR DISLOCATIONS. Time for at- tempting reduc- tion. Anatomy of the joint. In those instances in which the bone remains in the axilla, in dislocations of the shoulder, a serviceable limb, and very extensive motions of it, may be regained, although reduction has not been effected. Captain S , who had dislocated his shoulder four years before, called to shew me how much motion he had recover- ed, although the arm still remained unreduced. I am of opinion, that three months after the accident for the shoulder, and eight weeks for the hip, may be fixed as the period at which it would be imprudent to make the attempt at reduction, except in persons of extremely relaxed fibre, or of advanced age. At the same time, I am fully aware, that the shoulder has been re- duced at a more distant period than that which I have mentioned; but, in most instances, the reduction has been attended with the results I have just been deprecating. In cases of unreduced dislocation, the only course which the surgeon can adopt, after the inflammation which the injury pro- duces has subsided, is, to advise motion of the limb, and friction of the injured part:—The former, to produce a new cavity for the head of the bone, to assist in forming a new ligament, and to re- store action to muscles, which they would otherwise lose by re-, pose;—the latter, to promote absorption, and to remove the swell- ing and adhesions which the accident has caused. PARTICULAR DISLOCATIONS. DISLOCATIONS OF THE HIP-JOINT. The acetabulum of the hip-joint is deepened by a cartilaginous I ridge, which surrounds its brim; and although in the skeleton it is * not a complete cup, yet it is rendered such in the living subject, by f

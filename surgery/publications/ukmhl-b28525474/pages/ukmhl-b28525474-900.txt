WOUNDS OF THE THROAT. 224 through the cellular tissue, upon its surface, which, from its firm- ness, will support the ligature, and thus bring the edges of the aperture into contact; but do not penetrate the trachea itself with the needle. Thus securing the trachea, bring the edges of the external wound together by bending the head forwards ; but do not apply adhesive plaister, as it prevents the escape of air and blood in coughing, produces additional difficulty of breathing, and occasions emphysema. The ligature upon the cellular covering of the trachea, is to be separated by the ulcerative process, which will generally be effected in a week. A transverse wound in the trachea, will be followed sometimes m by a loss of voice, on account of the division of the recurrent nerves. If one of the carotid arteries be opened, death is usually so I instantaneous that the patient cannot be saved. If a surgeon were | present, or the wound was very small, and he could reach the pa- I tient before he expired, he should thrust his finger into the wound to stop the flow of blood, and then cut down upon the vessel, to ex- n pose it sufficiently to place a ligature upon it, which he can after- r- wards better adjust*. â–  When the trachea is deeply cut, the oesophagus is sometimes i wounded; and, if the injury be extensive, death will generally 1 ensue; but a stab into the oesophagus, or a small wound, may t be recovered from. | After an injury of this kind, the wound into the trachea is to be treated as in the former instance, by which that in the oesophagus | will be best approximated; all food, liquid or solid, must be avoided, and the patient is to be supported, as long as nature can bear it, by clysters. I object entirely to the introduction of tubes ' into the pharynx and oesophagus, as worse than unnecessary; for they are highly injurious by the cough which they occasion, : * See case of wounded carotid.

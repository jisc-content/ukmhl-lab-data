I recommended him to go into the country, and he went to Bath, where he staid for some time, and got rid of his paralysis. This case made a good deal of noise in town; and there were some surgeons who expressed a strong wish to prosecute the doctor. I recommended them, however, not to take any steps until I had seen the patient himself: and when he next came to me, I asked him whether he thought his legs improved, and whether he would again undergo the same operation, at a similar hazard of his'life, to have his legs made a little straighter?

It relieved the spasms, and, as I believe, saved the child. If opium, applied to the surface of sores, be absorbed into the system, it produces excessive costiveness, extreme pain in the head, and torpor of the system, which is only to be removed by the frequent administration of active purgatives.

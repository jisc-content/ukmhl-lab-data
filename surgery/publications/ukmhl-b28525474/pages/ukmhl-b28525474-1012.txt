328 FRACTURES OF THE UPPER PART OF THE THIGH-BONE. Difference of opinion recon- ciled. Treatment. degree of diminution in the length of the limb, and his answer was, “ If you mention three quarters of an inch, you will state rather more than its degree of retraction, even when all the mus- cles were contracted to their utmost rigidity.” I shall be happy to shew the parts which I removed from the case, with all the sur- rounding muscles, to any person who wishes to see them, as they at once explain the nature of the accident, and the reason why the limb is so little shortened. Although, then, this accident has some of the marks of fracture of the neck of the bone within the ligament, yet it unites by bone, and it will be seen that the union is similar to that of other bones external to the joints; cartilage is first deposited, and then the matter of bone, because in this case the parts can be brought into apposition, and the ends of the bones are confined together by the surrounding muscles ; one portion is pressed against the other and the neck of the bone sinks deeply into the cancellated structure of the trochanter; thus direct approximation and pressure are pre- served when the fracture is at the junction of the cervix with the trochanter, and the nutrition of each extremity of the bone is well supported by the vessels which proceed to it from the surrounding parts. We now see the reason of the difference of opinion respecting the union of fracture of the neck of the thigh-bone. In the inter- nal fracture the bones are not applied to each other, and the nutri- tion of the head of the bone being imperfect, in general no ossific change is produced ; but in the external fracture the bones are held together by the surrounding parts, easily kept in apposition by ex- ternal pressure, and there is not only ossific union, but very ex- uberant callus. Much time is required in these accidents to pro- duce a complete ossific union ; and the neck of the bone, received into the cancelli, moves for a long period in its new situation; although it is so far locked in as to prevent its separation. In the treatment of this injury, the principle is, to keep the bones in approximation by pressing the trochanter towards the acetabulum ; and the length of the limb is preserved by applying a

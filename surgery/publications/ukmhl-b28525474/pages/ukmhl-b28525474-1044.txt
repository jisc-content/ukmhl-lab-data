356 FRACTURES OF THE KNEE. Ligamentous union. contact, so as to be united in the transverse fracture by ossific union; but the less the distance between the bones, the greater is the power which the muscle re-acquires ; for, in proportion as the muscle is shortened, it is weakened: and in ascending, there is difficulty in raising the limb ; in descending, in keeping it ex- tended ; and the uniting ligament is liable to be torn, and the other patella to be broken by falls ; therefore, the surgeon should bring the bones as near together as he can, to render the ligament- ous union as short as possible, and consequently to leave the muscle with as much of its original power as the nature of the accident will permit. PERPENDICULAR FRACTURE OF THE PATELLA. There is in the collection at St. Thomas’s Hospital a patella, one fourth of which has been broken off; the edge is smooth, and no attempt at ossific union appears to have been made. A gentleman consulted me who had about one third of the patella separated from the other part of the bone ; it had united by ligament, for there was free motion between the fractured piece of bone and that from which it had been removed. He recovered quickly from this injury, and it affected his power of walking very little. During the winter of 1822, a body was dissected at St. Tho- mas’s Hospital, in which both the patellae had been broken longi- tudinally ; and although they were in contact, they were both united by ligament. These circumstances surprised me, because I saw no reason why the patella should not be united by bone when broken per- pendicularly, as I thought the muscles would have a tendency to bring the parts together. I made it therefore a subject of experiment. Experiment /. July 31st, 1818, I broke the patella of a dog by placing a knife i

OF THE NERVES OF THE TESTIS, AND 290 Nerves of the testis. OF THE NERVES OF THE TESTIS AND SPERMATIC CORD, AND PARTS ADJACENT. Three sets of nerves supply the testis and neighbouring- parts: the first are those in the vicinity of the external ring; the second, the external spermatic nerves distributed to the cord ; and the third, the spermatic plexus, which is derived from the grand sympathetic. The first nerve is derived from a muscular branch, which may be traced to the upper part of the lumbar plexus, arising from the first and second lumbar nerves. It passes downwards over the quadratus lumborum, to ramify between the abdominal muscles, and to terminate in cutaneous nerves The principal branch of this nerve is found piercing the internal oblique, on the inner side of the spinous process of the ilium, and just over Poupart’s ligament. It then runs between the internal oblique and tendon of the external oblique muscle, towards the external ring, through which it passes in conjunction with the spermatic cord; and, immediately dividing into a number of filaments, is finally distributed to the skin of the groin, the upper part of the scrotum, and root of the penis. Sometimes, instead of one, there are two branches passing through the ring; and occasionally one nerve is formed by the junction of two or more filaments, which pierce the fibres of the internal oblique separately, and unite before they emerge with the cord. Secondly, the external spermatic nerve is derived from the second lumbar nerve, and pierces the upper part of the psoas muscle. It then descends towards Poupart’s ligament, lying on the psoas, or rather upon its fascial covering, and divides into two branches. One of these, the smaller inner, or cremasteric branch, is closely connected with, and partly covered by, the spermatic vessels, in company with which it passes through the internal ring, and immediately enters the fibres of the cremaster; here it divides into a number of filaments, most of which are distributed in that

OF THE PHRENIC HERNIA. 1G3 m 2 protruded into the chest, through the same opening by which the arch of the colon had passed. The displacement of the stomach, and left lobe of the liver, had arisen from the altered position of the colon and omentum; which, in their preternatural course towards the diaphragm, occupied the situation of each of these parts. When the chest was examined, the left lung did not appear of more than one third its natural size; it was placed at the upper part of the thorax, and was united to the pleura costalis by recent adhesions. The protruded omentum and colon were found at the lower part of the left cavity of the chest, between the lung and the diaphragm, floating in a pint of bloody-coloured serum. The colon, in colour, was darker than usual; in texture, softer, and distended with feculent matter mixed with a brownish mucus. The portion of the intestine contained within the chest measured eleven inches. The omentum was also slightly altered in colour, being rather darker than natural; but, in other respects, this viscus was not changed; it adhered firmly to the edge of the aperture, and more than half of its substance was contained within Ithe chest. 1 The opening through which these viscera had protruded, was placed in the muscular part of the diaphragm, three inches from the oesophagus; it was of a circular figure, and two inches in dia- meter ; its edge was smooth, but thicker than the other parts of :he muscle. The peritoneum terminated abruptly at the edge of this aperture, so that the protruding parts were not contained in a sac, as in cases if common hernia, but floated loosely, and without a covering, in :he cavity of the chest, of which they occupied so large a space, as o occasion considerable pressure on the left lung, and to produce he diminution I have before remarked. The right side of the chest, also the right lung and the heart, vere free from disease. Could the precise nature of this disease be ascertained during

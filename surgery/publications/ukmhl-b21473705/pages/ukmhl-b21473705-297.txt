59 ad banc diem minor Britannia appellatur."— SlGEBERT. " Tempore liujus Lhotarii venerunt trans- marini Britones in minorem Britanniam."—Bre TON Chronicle. " Eximius Christi confessor Jodaeus^ de illustri procedens genealogia Riwali, qui principabatur de transmarina, sive majori, Britannia, quas modo dicitur Anglia, et postraodum in copiosa navium multitudine et manu valida exteriorem sibi subjecit Britanniam."—Life of St. Josse. It is asserted also that the remains of the same Celtic race may be found on the continent, among the Wends of Lusatia, and the JValloons of the Low Countries: but from what T have heard spoken of the Walloon language, I cannot persuade myself that it retains any more of the Celtic, than is to be found in the early French; and am inclined to think that the Wendish does not possess even so gi-eat a resemblance to it. It may also be observed that a notion has long prevailed that the Waldensic language, or Vandois of Piedmont, bears a strong affinity to the Irish : in confirmation of which the specimen of the .Waldensic, given in Chamberlayne's " Oratio Dominica," is adduced; and which, it must be allowed, proves to be genuine Irish.

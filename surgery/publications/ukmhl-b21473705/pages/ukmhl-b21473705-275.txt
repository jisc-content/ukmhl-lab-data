37 siderably alter the bearing- of many opinions, hitherto entertained. But, as a system, so new, and unlooked for, cannot be expected to be received without proof, I shall state such facts as, I trust, will be sufficient, to place the matter beyond all reasonable doubt. And as the Principality of Wales alfords a great variety of the different characters alluded to, I shall therefore com- mence with that portion of the island. And, though writers upon this subject have generally referred to the colour of the hair, yet I must state my opinion, that it is by no means so steady and decided a characteristic as that of the eye. The hair is continually changing its hue, even in individuals; for what in the child is yelloio becomes in a few years broiun, and, at maturity, not unfrequently black: but the colour of the eye is much more fixed, and unchangeable: usually assuming its character of hue, at a very early period of infancy, and retaining it, without any great variation, to advanced age. Besides, the light eye is ac- companied by every shade of hair, whether red, yellow,, or black. And the colour of the eye is apparently less influenced by those external causes, which sooner or later must succeed in changing the general physiological character.

For it is a remark- able fact, and no less so, as having remained so long unnoticed, that in Britain the dark- coloured eye is always found to prevail in the neighbourhood of coal mines ; and where coal is used as the general fuel: while, on the other hand, the light or blue eye belongs to those districts, in which that mineral is not used; and notwithstanding the numbers of persons, continually pouring into the coal districts, from other parts of the country, in consequence of the demand for labour, yet the prevalency, in the former, of the dark eye, especially among the children, is so evident, that whoever will take the trouble to make the observation will most assuredly acknowledge the accuracy of this statement. In what way the sulphurated hydrogen, &c. occasioned by the coal fires, affects the pigment of the iris, it is not now my intention to inquire. T consider it sufficient, for my present purpose, to establish the con- nexion between the use of coal, and the dark colour of the eye: though, from repeated ob- servations, I feel assured, that there are more curious facts connected with the subject than have yet come under the notice of physiologists : and which, when properly developed, will con-

23 ON MEDICAL EDUCATION, &C. a situation the physician holds, and how im- portant a part he has to perform, and how difficult it often is to perform this part well, there would be more hesitation shown than we generally see shown ere the profession was embraced. If it were remembered that upon his opinions and acts depend the lives of fellow men, and that according as he is well or ill qualified for his part, he is either a blessing or a curse to mankind, parents would hesitate more than they do ere they advised their children to a profession so res- ponsible, and the children themselves, if at all come to years, would hesitate as much as the parents. If it were properly impressed upon men, that not only may torturing disease be protracted, but that even death itself may ensue—that the wife may be made a widow, and the children fatherless, and af- fliction sent on a whole circle—by ignorance, when by proper interference no calamity would have come, surely more attention should be given to Medicine, and those only should be put to it who are likely to be qua- lified for it; by which two great purposes would be served—namely, the health and lives of society would be better preserved.

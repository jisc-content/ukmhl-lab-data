78 resistance^ wliich the Silurians made to llie Romans^ under their ilhistrious leader Carac- TACUS*=; even long after the Belga; and other eastern tribes had submitted. * I consider it but justice to the memory of this brave man, to rescue his character from the injury, which it has been long suffering at the hands of his modern historians, through, what appears to myself, a misconception of the language of the Roman annalist. For in the celebrated speech of Caractacus, before the Emperor Claudius, given by Tacitus, Ann. lib. 12, we have the following words: " Si quanta nobilitas et fortuna mihi fuit, tanta rerum prospe- rarum moderatio fuisset, amicus potius in banc urbem quam captus venissem." Now the various translators of this pas- sage make Caractacus reproach himself with the vices of excess. " Had my moderation in prosperity been equal to," &c.: and some have even proceeded to criticise and censure his conduct accordingly. But as Murphy's translation is the one most generally known, the following extract from that work may serve as a specimen of the others. " If to the nobility of my birth' and the splendour of exalted station I had united the virtues of moderation, Rome had beheld me not in captivity, but a royal visiter and a friend." But it appears evident to me that this is by no means the sense of the original. The obvious meaning of the passage, to myself, is as follows: " Had the measure of my prosperiiy been equal to the nobleness of my birth and my exalted station, I might have come into this city, rather as a friend , than a captive." The Silurian chief was here asserting his dignity as a prince, and not confessing faults, of which he had never been accused.

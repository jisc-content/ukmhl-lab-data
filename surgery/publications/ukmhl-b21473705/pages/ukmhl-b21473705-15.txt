And, after having got done with the student and sur- geon, I then give some hints to the public in general on the study of Medicine as a part of a liberal education—on the conduct of the pub- lic towards medical men in the practice of their profession—and on the opinions which prevail in society regarding the exhumation and dissection of the dead. It will be easy, without any farther instruction, for each party concerned to pick out what particularly re- lates to them ; but it will do no harm to mention, that the three first Letters are in- tended for the parent and guardian ; the four following these for the student; the next two for the young physician or surgeon; and the last three for the public in general. How- ever, I trust even the whole book may be perused with some little advantage by all or either of the parties. The student and young surgeon may not be the worse for reading it all; and though to the others some parts of it may not be very interesting, yet if they take any interest in medical science, they may perhaps find time to glance at the whole.

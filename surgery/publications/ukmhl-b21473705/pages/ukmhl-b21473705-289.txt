51 was presently explained^ by the appearance of some coal-pits, with their machinery, by the road side. And so true have I always found this indication, that, if, on travelling among a xanthous people, I should suddenly come to a district of the melanic character, I should with- out hesitation conclude that they had the use of coal fuel. I persuade myself that, in the judgment of every unprejudiced person, I have now proved to a demonstration that the people of Britain are not distinguishable from each other, by any marks of Gothic or Celtic origin, or by any physical difference connected with those races: but that what has hitherto been considered as the Celtic distinction, i. e. the dark-coloured eye and hair, is merely the physical character of the inhabitants of those districts/ in which coal is used, as fuel; and that the blue and light coloured eye, which has been so decidedly pro- nounced the grand and peculiar feature of the Goths, is alike the property of Celts, where that fuel is not used. And thus I cannot but believe that I have overturned a very foolish and unfounded system, which has long perplexed and misled both physiologists and historians. e2

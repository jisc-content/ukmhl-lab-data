71 earns. There is likewise, among the ruins, an oblong- square enclosure, one hundred and thirty feet long", formed of a low agger of loose stones, with an entrance, and having within it two other enclosures of a similar description. I have noticed the remains of earns, if such they may be called, of the same construction, at Aviemore, near Rothiemurcus in Strathspey: and of a small one, near Aros in the island of Mull, &c. *: but these on the Nairn are, without exception, the most extraordinary of the kind' in the kingdom. And it is deserving of notice, that some works connected with these monu- ments may be traced to a considerable distance along the adjacent country : for instance, on the field of Culloden; where there may be observed a great number of small mounds of earth: many so low as to be scarcely discernible among the heather; which the people of the neighbouring cottages suppose to be breast-works, thrown up by the Highlanders, as a protection against the cannon of the English army. But this is hardly probable; as the mounds are by no means in military alignement, but irregularly scattered * There was a similar earn at Cyfin, in the parish of Llan-Gadvan, North Wales.

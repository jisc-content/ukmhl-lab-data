It may be inferred nevertheless that, about the Norman conquest of England, this character had ceased to be general; because we find that, when red hair did occur, it was considered so much a personal peculiarity, as to occasion its owner to be designated by it, as in the case of William Rufus (the red-haired). From such an examination of the elements, of which the British people are composed, it is certain that, whatever peculiar character any portion of them may originally have possessed, it has in every instance been completely changed, as far as any original distinctions have been made known to us. And, as this change has been effected by accidental causes, it may not be uninteresting, and certainly not irrelevant to our subject, to take a cursory view of the inhabitants of Britain, as they are at this day distinguishable, by their respective characteris- tics.

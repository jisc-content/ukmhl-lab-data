40 they were acquainted with the use of coal, which is found in such abundance in their country; as Pennant informs us, that an ancient flint axe was actually discovered in one of the coal veins of Monmouthshire. As we return from South Wales, the change becomes visible, in the course of a few miles: for, as we quit the vicinity of the coal fires, the light eye resumes its prevalency, until we approach the coal of North Wales, in the neighbourhood of Rhuabon, and Oswestry : where the dark eye again appears; notwith- standing the smallness of the coal basin, and the number of strangers employed in working it. But though the people of North Wales are generally a blue-eyed race, as Dr. Macculloch has justly observed, yet that colour assumes various shades; and, from Conway to Holywell, the iris has an extraordinary uniform leaden hue. The dark shade, as I apprehend, being thrown in, by the small supply of coal along that coast. It ought to be observed here, that in towns, where coal fires are used, even in the clay and slate districts, the dark eye is not uncommon; as in the town of Llandovery for instance: while the people of the surrounding country, who burn turf and wood, are universally light-eyed.

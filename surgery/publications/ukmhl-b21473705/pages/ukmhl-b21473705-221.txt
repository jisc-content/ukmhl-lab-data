It is only because he is at present nearly altogether without bodies, that dangerous as it may be, he either ven- tures to the church-yard himself, or employs some of those wretched beings who make it their trade, to seek the bodies for him. In his zeal for science, in his thirst after know- ledge, he will make the attempt to procure subjects at all hazards. And as the punish- ment is the same in case of discovery, whe- ther he steals the corpse of a poor or of a rich man, he of course stands upon little ce- remony. He must have subjects, if it be posssible to get them at all, and rich and poor are alike to him, for the fabric of clay is alike in both. But if the plan which I have proposed were adopted no danger would happen to either party. Then the anatomist, being satisfied, would have nothing more to ask for,â€”he would not seek to risk both his life and his character in a traffic so revolting. And, knowing this, friends would then bury

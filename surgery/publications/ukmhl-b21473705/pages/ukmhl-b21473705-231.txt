PREFACE. The following pages, though chiefly written upon the subject of Physiognomy, yet have no reference whatever to that science, as connected with either its Lavaterian" or Astrological departments; but are solely designed as a refutation of another, and more pernicious system of opinions; that is, of the modern theory of original national distinctions, and of generic diver- sities of the human race; and to remove that stumbling-block, which has of late years so greatly cumbered the path of History and Physiology.

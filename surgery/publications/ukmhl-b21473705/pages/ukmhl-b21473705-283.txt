45 iiODiical appearance^ of course these black-eyed people must be Celts. And it happens most opportunely for his system, that this was the country of the Strathclyde Britons, or Welsh of Strathclyde (Stratclud-Walli), whose citadel was on the rock of Dumbarton: and therefore he is convinced that the people retain the Celtic character of their ancestors to this day. And this circumstance, in conjunction with that of the same character occurring- among the descen- dants of the Silurians of South Wales, seems to establish the fact to a demonstration:â€”The blue-eyed Celts of the remainder of Wales, Cumberland, and Ireland, being entirely over- looked ; and these inconsiderable spots made to represent the great Celtic race. Whether the author of Ossian was afflicted with the Celtogothic mania, and wished to make his heroine a genuine Briton of Alclud, or a Roman of Theodosia*, he certainly con- trived to make her, in some respects, correspond with the character of the country: for in describ- ing Moina of Balclutha, in the poem of Carthon, * Theodosia was the Roman name of Alclud, or Dum- barton : and I am inclined to think, that it was the Twr Tewdws of the Welsh ; i. e. The Tower of Theodosia: as that name occurs in their old MSS.; though it is now used to signify the constellation of the Pleiades.

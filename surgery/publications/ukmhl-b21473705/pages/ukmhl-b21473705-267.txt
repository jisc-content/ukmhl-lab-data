29 enabled us to ascertain whether the first colo- nists of South America were blacks from the tropics, or whites from the north, we cannot determine whether the American Indians have been tanned, or bleached, to their present inter- mediate colour, between black and white. But it is probable that the climate of America would never darken the skin, to the degree, in which it is seen in the negro. One thing however is certain, that the native tribes of America, though generally partaking of the copper colour, yet vary considerably, with regard to the several shades of that colour; from dark brown to almost white; as they also do in stature, and feature. Whether this variety is caused by climate and soil, or by food and habit, we have not yet any facts, from which to determine. It is however ascertained, that the elevated regions are always inhabited by tribes of a lighter com- plexion, than the flat seacoasts: there is like- wise a great variety of feature, from the aquiline nose to the low Calmuc physiognomy.

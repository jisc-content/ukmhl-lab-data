Non contendre en judici. Non veniar si meseime. Amar la enemie. Love not the world. Avoid bad company. If possible be at peace with all men. Strive not in law. Revenge not yourselves. Love your enemy. The following lines, taken out of the ancient Waldensic poem of the Nobla* Leiqon, written about the year 1100, will serve as a specimen of the language of that time. " Que sel troba alcun bon que vollia amar Dio, e temer Jeshu Xrist; Que non vollia maudire, ni jurar, ni mentir, &c.

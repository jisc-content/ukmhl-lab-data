34 the same writer, that a considerable degree of change is sometimes perceptible, even in the same individuals. " It is probable," says he, " that the hair becomes long and straight, or curled or frizzled, according to the nature of the food, chiefly. It is remarkable that the natives of Drent, and of the Bishopric of Munster, have naturally sleek hair; but after they have resided some years in Amsterdam, it begins to curl. Of this we have many in- stances." Now, if such changes as these are produced, in one or two generations, and even in the same individuals, we must needs admit them to be indisputable proofs of the effect of climate and habit, upon the human physiognomy. And, even in the undoubted descendants of the same ancestors, we often meet with differ- ences of character, fully equal to those which PiNKERTON and his followers would suppose to exist between Goths and Celts; and to form the immutable distinctions of those two races.

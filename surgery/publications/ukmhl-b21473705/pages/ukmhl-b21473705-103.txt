ON MEDICAL EDUCATION, &C. 85 or seemingly not so important, he gives to these a very small share of his regard. In Chemistry, he will attend carefully to all that is decidedly connected with Medicine, but what is unconnected with it, he leaves till another time, to be studied as inclination and opportunity may suit. In Physiology, he is satisfied with attending to the common and well known parts ; the^ less interesting ones, and the less understood ones, he gives himself no trouble about. In Surgery also, he will only attend to the great doctrines—to the great and prominent points and principles— and the minor parts, which he thinks he can learn at any time, are left altogether behind. And so on with the other branches. Thus each picks out what he conceives to be use- ful things, and thus the science is not studied as a whole, but only in parts. But what is the consequence ? The consequence is, that no part of the science is studied as it should be. For, as we have already said, the science is so much of a whole—each part is so necessary for the illustration of the other— that nothing can be left out, and we must know all the parts if we would know any one part well.

96 In the south of England^ the natives are of a moderate stature; and not remarkable for any distinguishing bodily character. In the midland counties^ they are of a very coarse and homely style of appearance ; both with regard to stature and features: and in the fenny counties, re- markably so. But as we proceed northwardS;, a visible change takes place. In Lancashire and York- shire, where the influence of manufacturing habits has not reached, the natives are of a taller stature than in the south ; but, at the same time, of an awkward make, and apparently less capable of action. In Lancashire, the blue eye prevails, with the dark rim around the iris, contributing greatly to expression. The females have often been celebrated for their beauty. Their features are certainly more regular than those of some of their southern neighbours: the face is longish, and tapering towards the chin: the nose thin, and well chiselled. In the coal districts the eye is dark. The people of Cumberland, beyond the in- fluence of the coal, have nothing to distinguish them from those of some of the southern coun- ties.

70 ON MEDICAL EDUCATION, &C. The advice given him here is meant chiefly to help him in adapting his course. We would wish him to come as near as possible to the plan here laid down; because we con- ceive it to be the best one; but, at the same time, he must keep in view the particular plan which is required of him at the school where he studies, and he must be regulated in so far by it. When he has chosen his school, he will, of course, make inquiry regard- ing the number of years he must study, the various classes he must attend, &c., and then, when he has ascertained this, he will regulate matters according to the best of his judgment, so as to do all he can in the space which he allots for his education. In Edinburgh, to qualify for physician, four winter sessions are required. In Glasgow three will suffice. In London six years of study are demanded to qualify for surgeon; * and each particular school has its own regulations, which, as I have before said, must be carefully enquired into by the student before he begins his me- dical curriculum, in order that he may make no mistake, and find himself in no difficulty * Four of these years, however, may be spent under the private tuition of a surgeon. The student may attend all his classes in the last two years.

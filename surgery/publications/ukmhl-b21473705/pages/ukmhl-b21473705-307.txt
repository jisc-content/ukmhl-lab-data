69 of loose stones. These circles seem to have supplied materials for building part of the park wall, or dyke, as it is called, near which the two armies were drawn up, at the battle of Culloden Moor. On conversing with the people of the neigh- bourhood, I was informed that there were others of a similar description, a little to the south- ward. I accordingly proceeded in that direc- tion: and, on reaching the other side of the Nairn, was absolutely astonished at the immense number of earns, circles, and upright stones, which covered the plain, on the banks of the river, for nearly the space of a mile in length. At first sight they appeared a perfect labyrinth of ruins; but, on a more accurate inspection, I found them to consist of the remains of seven or eight large earns; each originally surrounded by a circle: and in some instances by two concentric circles of upright stones, at regular distances; besides innumerable (such to me at least they seemed) smaller earns and loose stones, scattered over the ground : the whole forming one of the most singular and striking- scenes I ever beheld, and evidently once be- longing to some great metropolitan Druidic establishment.

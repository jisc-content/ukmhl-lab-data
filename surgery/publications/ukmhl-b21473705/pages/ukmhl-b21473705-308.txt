70 Many of the cams have been greatly reduced, and their circles demolished, for the purpose of building the neighbouring houses and fences; and doubtless many others have entirely dis- appeared. The larger earns, including the outer circle, are sixty or seventy feet in diame- ter. The tall stones are about six feet high; and in some instances ten or eleven. One earn is surrounded by a circle, consisting originally of thirteen of these upright stones; standing twenty-four feet asunder, and twenty-four feet from the central heap: which is upwards of twenty feet in diameter and of proportionable height. Two other earns are each surrounded by a circle of eleven upright stones; and another by a circle of nine stones of the same description: though none of the circles are now in a perfect state.

Whether all these earns are constructed in this manner, or whether these pitched areas were always covered with a central conical heap of stones, I could not determine, though upon that sup- position I have here included them among the

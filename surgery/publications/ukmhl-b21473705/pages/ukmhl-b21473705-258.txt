20 food is more plentiful present a much more robust frame of body. But we have only to go into our own manufacturing districts to see the difference between the well and ill fed of the same race. In fact, the change of quality and quantity of food is known to produce very ex- traordinary revolutions in every department of the animal creation. For instance, it is a well established fact among graziers, that breeds of animals increase in bulk and weight according to the improvement of their food. Thus the small Highland cattle called kyloes, when allowed to propagate in the richer pastures of the south, even though kept separate and unmixed, will, in a very few generations, become so much improved in size, as to weigh almost double as much as those of the orginal importation. But if the tall large limbed Goths of anti- quity never could furnish the smaller dark- haired people of the present day, what then has occasioned the change, which is so perceptible in all parts of the world with regard to these characteristics? For instance, it is recorded, that when Charles Martel overthrew the Saracen army, A. D. 732, he was greatly indebted for his victory to the Germans from the banks of the Rhine; whose superior strength and stature enabled them to carry such heavy battleaxes.

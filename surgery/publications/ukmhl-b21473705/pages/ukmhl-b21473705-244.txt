6 whole of the Celtic race must have been of the dark or melanic complexion; although the evi- dences to the contrary are fully as clear and distinct;, with regard to the Celtic, as to the undoubted Gothic tribes. For Pausanias avers, that the Gauls in general surpassed other men in stature: and as to their being red, and yellow-haired, we have the testimony of a variety of ancient authors. Thus Virgil, in speaking of that people, says that they have golden hair: " Aurea caesaries ollis." LivY also mentionS'the red hair of the Gauls: " Rutilalae comae Gallorum." And SiLius calls it red and golden : " Auro certantem et rutilum sub vertice nodum." So Claudian observes of the .fierce and yellow-haired Gauls: " Inde truces flavo comitantur vertice Galli." And again: " turn flava repcxo Gallia crine," &c.

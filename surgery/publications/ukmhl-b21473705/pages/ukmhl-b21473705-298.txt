60 On referring, however, to the language of the Waldenses at the present day, we do not recog- nise in it the least resemblance to the Irish. And their old writings prove that they have not for many centuries spoken a language different in origin from the one now in use; which is nearly allied to the Romance, or old French: being the corruption of the Latin, common to that part of the continent, in the early ages. But I am satisfied that I shall explain away the whole difficulty, by merely stating, that, in the time of Cromwell, a great number of Irish Roman Catholics emigrated to the continent, and were put in possession of those valleys of ' Piedmont; from which the Vaudois had been expelled during the persecutions, they suffered from the church of Rome. It is therefore highly probable, that Chamberlayne's specimen is from the Irish of these very emigrants ; who were afterwards in their turn so completely expelled by the Vaudois, that there is now no trace of the Irish left in those valleys. In confirmation of this opinion I shall insert Chamberlayne's specimen of the Waldensic, together with the same in modern Irish.

205 ON MEDICAL EDUCATION, &C. others of the continental countries, where the bodies of the patients are altogether at the disposal of the surgeon. This would not suit English feeling. Many, I am satisfied, would rather submit to disease in its most dread- ful form, and die, than become the inmates of an hospital, if they imagined there was the least chance of their remains being given to the anatomist, so great is their horror towards such a proceeding. And, as this is a principle firmly rooted in them, it would not be politic to fight against it. I would there- fore protect the remains of the poor in our hospitals in the same way that I would pro- tect them in the private dwelling. But I would take the bodies of all who entered the hospital without friends ; I would dissect all who died there unclaimed; which is what no sensible person could object to, knowing that it could do hurt to no one, and that it would be so much for the benefit of society at large.* * Of late, the subject here treated of has occupied the attention of the Legislature. A great body of evidence, relating to the method of procuring subjects, the scarcity of the supply, &c.has been taken be- fore a Committee of the House of Commons, and the result is, that in a short time we are likely to have the matter arranged, so that both the feelings of the community, and the advancement of science, will be attended to. What I have ventured to propose above seems to be a part of the plan of the Committeeâ€”namely, to give to dissection the unclaimed inmates of our Work-houses, &c. Sir Astley Cooper has proposed, that a Director of Anatomy should be appointed to dis- tribute the subjects to the different Schools, and regulate the whole matter. This is a proposal worthy of being attended to.

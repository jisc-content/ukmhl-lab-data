75 versally allowed that the Gothic nations had no Druids : " Neque Druidas habent." Bat in the description, which the Roman writers give of Britain, it is stated, not only that Drmdism was the religion of the island, but that it was in Britain that the system flourished in its greatest perfection: insomuch that the principal families of Gaul sent their sons over into Britain, to be educated according to the Druidic principles. Now in all this there is no exception made, with regard to the Belgae; but on the contrary, there is every reason to conclude that they also acknowledged the Druidic system. It is true Caesar says, that the continental Belgas were for the most part descended from the Germans : " Plerosque Belgas esse ortos a Germanis." But as a long period had elapsed between the arrival of the Belg^e in Britain, and the time of Caesar, it is possible that the continental tribes had undergone a German mixture ; as the word ''^plerosque'''' would indeed imply. But, after all, the word German was of such vague signification, that it cannot always be ascertained, whether it was descriptive of the Gothic or Celtic tribes, inhabiting Germany.

ON MEDICAL EDUCATION, &C. 113 Elliotson, is also in repute, and may be con- sulted with advantage. In Chemistry, there are many authors of note, but, as in the other branches, there are only a few proper for the student. Mr Parkes has written a very superior book in the form of a Catechism. It is short, (at least, if we set aside the notes), and easy to be understood, and conveys in a familiar way so much interesting knowledge, that even the beginner in Chemistry reads it with ex- treme fondness. Even in the text it explains all the important and essential parts of Che- mical Science, and if we take in the notes, it contains, although after all it is only an oc- tavo volume, perhaps more particular infor- mation in Chemistry than is to be found in any other work. The method of reading it is, to read first the text—the mere question and answer part—then, when this has been frequently read, and fully understood, the notes may be consulted. The notes may also be frequently read over, for they cannot be too well impressed, and they are so interest- ing that the student is never tired of them* And when all this is done, I think the read^ er must be a tolerable chemist.

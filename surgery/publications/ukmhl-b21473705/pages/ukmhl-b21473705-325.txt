Nevertheless the physiognomical distinctions between Goths and Celts have been as strenuously insisted upon, as if the present English exhibited their universal character of red hair, blue eyes^ and gigantic stature. But it is not only in this instance, that the love of system carries its supporters into the extreme of prejudice: for this Gothic blood is made to engross all the virtues of the kingdom. For example, it is usual, when discussing the merits and origin of our admirable constitution and national liberty, to attribute all these ad- vantages to the German origin of the Saxons. The representation of the people in parliament, trial by jury, rights of free citizens, all origi- nated, it is alleged, in the German woods !!!

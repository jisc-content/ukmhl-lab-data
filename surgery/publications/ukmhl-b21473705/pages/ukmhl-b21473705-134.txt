116 ON MEDICAL EDUCATION, &C. to get a licence to practise Medicine, with- out being able to do so. These, then, are all the books which he requires while he is study- ing Materia Medica and Pharmacy ; namely, Mr Murray's book, the Dispensatory, and Pharmacopoeia. On the Practice of Physic, he will also stand in need of three works; namely, the Mo- dern Practice of Physic, by Dr. Thomas, Dr. Cullen's First Lines, and his System of No- sology. I do not give my unqualified appro- bation to the work of Dr. Thomas. There is room for a better; and I believe Dr. Gregory of London, has written a book of merit upon this subject. Yet Dr. Thomas's work is a fair performance, both as regards the description of diseases, and the treatment of them, but I chiefly recommend it to the student on ac- count of the therapeutics. The symptoms of disease he will learn infinitely better from the First Lines of Dr. Cullen, which is a book elegantly and methodically written, and de- serving of being often read by every medical student, although the therapeutical part of it is not quite minute enough to answer his purpose. The Nosology of Cullen is also to be studied attentively. This is the great foundation upon which the physician builds.

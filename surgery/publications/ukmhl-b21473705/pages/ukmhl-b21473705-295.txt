On the continent, a portion of the same people still exists in Brittany; where a colony of Welsh settled in the fourth and fifth cen- turies. And it is a curious fact, that it was this small Welsh colony, which occasioned the title of" Greaf'^ to be conferred upon our island Britain. For, when these insular Britons emi- grated from Wales to Armorica, they changed the name of that province into " Britain :" and, in order to distinguish the two countries from each other, called the one " Great," the other " Little Britain," which distinctions were adopted by * The origin of the title of the celebrated Wallace has somewhat puzzled antiquarians: but, as he is called, in ancient documents, William de Walleys, I see no reason, in default of better authority, why he should not have taken it from the country of the Walli, or Welsh of Strathclydeâ€”the Stratclud Walli, in which he resided. But whether he was a Goth or a Celt I shall not even inquire.

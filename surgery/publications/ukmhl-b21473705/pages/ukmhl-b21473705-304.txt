66 or rather the north sea; and dwelt there, on the coast of that sea. And lastly came the Saxons. The Triads also record the coming of the Romans; who are called Caesarians, and who afterwards entirely left the island. They like- wise mention an ancient invasion of the Llych- lynians, or Scandinavians; who were expelled by the Britons, at the end of the third gene- ration: as also that of the later Llychlynians, or Norwegians. And again they speak of the Gwyddyl each, or " Red Gael, from Ireland: who came into Scotland." These must have been the Scots, or Dalriads, who passed over about the third century; and, according to some historians, were the first Gaelic people, that appeared in Scotland; whilst those, who feel jealous of the ancient honours of the Caledonian Gael, assert, that they existed there as a powerful people, under a long line of kings, such as Fingal, Cowal, &c. &:c. for many, centuries previous to the arrival of the Scots and Dalriads from Ireland; and even had the honour of defending their country against the Romans themselves. Unfortunately, there are no authentic records, to settle this dispute: bat, if the two Triads, from which I have quoted, and in which the Gaels are mentioned.

46 ON MEDICAL EDUCATION, &C. to be taken, with my reasons for recommend- ing such an order, and such other 'directions as I may deem are demanded. In the first session (which is a winter ses- sion*) the student is to attend lectures on Anatomy and Chemistry. Anatomy being the basis upon which all medical and surgical knowledge is founded, and Chemistry being also a chief prop of Medicine, these, of course, are the first things to which the attention should be directed. But as Anatomy especially prepares the way for Surgery, and Chemistry prepares us for the lectures on Materia Me- dica, which two branches of study (namely. Surgery and Materia Medica) are to occupy us in the second session, we must, of neces- sity, acquire a knowledge both of Anatomy and Chemistry in the first session. This is so plain that it is unnecessary to insist farther upon it; and it has always, indeed, been the general usage to make them the first classes. * It is necessary here to state, that I am supposing the student to be studying at some of those schools of medicine, such as Edinburgh, Glas- gow, or Dublin, where only one course of lectures is given in the year— the course beginning early in November, and ending late in April— thus giving the six summer months as a vacation between every winter session. In the London schools, where two courses, of four months each, are given in the winter, with a summer recess of four months, of course the plan of study which I am now laying down, will require to be altered somewhat. This must be left to the discretion of the stu- dent.

In the median line are seen from above downwards, the nasal eminences, which indicate the situation of the frontal sinuses; diverging outwards from the nasal eminences are the superciliary ridges which support the eyebrows. Beneath the nasal eminences is the arch of the nose, formed by the nasal bones, and the nasal processes of the superior maxillary. The nasal arch is convex from side to side, concave from above doAvn- wards, presenting in the median line the inter-nasal suture, formed betAveen the nasal bones, laterally the naso-maxillary suture, formed betAveen the nasal and the nasal process of the superior maxillary bones, both these sutures terminating above in that part of the transverse suture Avhicli connects the nasal bones and nasal 65.â€”Anterior Region of the Skull. processes of the superior maxillary with the frontal. BcIoav the nose is seen the heart-shaped opening of the anterior nares, the narrow end upwards, and broad beloAv; it presents laterally the thin sharp margins which serve for the attachment of the lateral cartilages of the nose, and in the middle line beloAAr, a prominent process, the anterior nasal spine, bounded by tAvo deep notches. BoloAAr this is the intermaxillary suture, and on each side of it the incisive fossa. Beneath this fossa is the alveolar process of the upper and lower jaw, containing the incisor teeth, and at the loAver part of the median line, the symphysis of the chin, the mental eminence, and the incisive fossa of the lower jaAV. Proceeding from above downwards, on each side, is the supra-orbital ridge, terminating externally in the external angular process at its junction with the

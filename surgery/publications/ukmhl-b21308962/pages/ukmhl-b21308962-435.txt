COMMON ILIAC. 397 Peculiarities. Its point of origin varies according to tho bifurcat ion of tho aorta. In three-fourths of a largo number of coses, the aorta biiurcttted either upon the fourth lumbar vertebra, or upon tho intervertebral disc between it and tho tilth; one case in nine boing below, and one in eleven above this point. In ten out of every thirteen eases, the vessel bifurcated within half an inch above or below the level of tho crest of tho ilium ; moro frequently below than above. Tho point of division is subject to great variety. In two-thirds of a largo number of cases, it was between tho last lumbar vertebra and the upper border of the sacrum ; in one case in eight being above, and in one in six below that point. 'I ho loft common iliac artery divides lower down more frequently than tho right. The relative length, also, of tho two common iliac arteries varies. The right common iliac was longest in sixty-three cases ; tho left, in fifty-two; whilst they were both equal in fifty-three. Tho length of tho arteries varied in five-sevenths oi the cases examined, from an inch and a-half to three inches; in about half of the remaining cases, the artery was longer ; and in the other half, shorter; the minimum length being less than half an inch, the maximum, four and a-half inches. In one instance, the right common iliac was found wanting, the external and internal iliacs arising directly from the aorta. 227.â€”Arteries of the Pelvis. Surgical Anatomy. The application of a ligature to the common iliac artery may be required on account of aneurism or hcemorrhage, implicating the external or internal iliacs, or on account of secondary hcemorrhage after amputation of the thigh high up. It has been seen, that the origin of this vessel corresponds to the left side of the umbilicus on a level with a line drawn from the highest point of one iliac crest to the opposite one, and its course to a line extending from the left side of the umbilicus downwards towards the

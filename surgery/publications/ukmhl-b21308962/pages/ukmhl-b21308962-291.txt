Its lower border forms the upper boundary of the spermatic canal. Lumbar Fascia (fig. 166). The vertebral aponeurosis of the Transversalis divides into three layers, an anterior, very thin, which is attached to the front part of the 165.—The Transversalis, Rectus, and Pyramidalis Muscles. apices of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae, and, above, to the lower margin of the last rib, forming the ligamentum arcuatum externum; a middle layer, much stronger, which is attached to the apices of the transverse processes; and a posterior layer, attached to the apices of the spinous processes. Between the anterior and middle layers is situated the Quadratus lumborum, between the middle and posterior, the Erector spinae. The posterior lamella of this aponeurosis receives the attachment of the Internal oblique; it is also blended with the apo- neurosis of the Serratus posticus inferior and with that of the Latissimus dorsi, forming the lumbar fascia.

In the upper part of its course, this vessel lies internal to the humerus; hut below, it is in front of that bone. Relations. This artery is super- ficial throughout its entire extent, being covered, in front, by the in- tegument, the superficial and deep fascial; the bicipital fascia separates it opposite the elbow from the me- dian basilic vein; the median nerve crosses it at its centre; and the basilic vein lies in the line of the artery, but separated from it by the fascia, in the lower half of its course. Behind, it is separated from the inner side of the humerus above, by the long and inner heads of the Triceps, the musculo-spiral nerve and superior profunda artery inter- vening; and from the front of the hone below, by the insertion of the Coraco-brachialis and tlxeBrachialis anticus muscles. By its outer side, it is in relation Avith the commence- ment of the median nerve, and the Coraco-brachialis and Biceps muscles, which slightly overlap the artery. By its inner side, Avith the internal cutaneous and ulnar nerves, its upper half; the median nerve, its loAver half. It is accompanied by two veins, the venae comites; they lie in close contact Avith the artery, being connected together at intervals by short transverse communicating branches.

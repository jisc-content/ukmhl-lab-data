748 SURGICAL ANATOMY OF THE PERINiEUM. In the lateral operation of lithotomy, the knife is carried obliquely across the back part of this space, downwards and outwards, into the ischio-rectal fossa, dividing the Transversus perinsei muscle and artery, the posterior fibres of the Accelerator urinas, the superficial peri meal vessels and nerve, and, more posteriorly, the external haemorrhoidal vessels. The superficial and transverse peri meal arteries are described at p. 402; and the superficial perinceal and inferior pudendal nerves, at pp. 554, 556. The Accelerator urinse and Erector penis muscles should now be removed, when the deep perinseal fascia will be exposed, stretching across the front part of the outlet of the pelvis. The urethra is seen perforating its centre, just behind the bulb; and on either side is the crus penis, connecting the corpus cavernosum with the ramus of the ischium and pubes. 392.â€”Deep Perinteal Fascia.

Compressor urethra:. Erector clitoridis. Sphincter ani. Transversus perinasi. Levator ani. Coccygeus. The Sphincter Vagince surrounds the orifice of the vagina, and is analogous to the Accelerator urinas in the male. It is attached, posteriorly, to the central tendon of the perinasum, where it blends with the Sphincter ani. Its fibres pass forwards on each side of the vagina, to be inserted into the corpora cavernosa and body of the clitoris. The Erector Clitoridis resembles the Erector penis in the male, but is smaller than it. The Transversus Perincei is inserted into the side of the Sphincter vaginas, and

73 LATERAL REGIONS OF THE SKULL. Lateral Region of the Skull. The Lateral Legion of the Shull is somewhat of a triangular form, its base being formed by a line extending from the external angular process of the frontal hone along the temporal ridge backwards to the outer extremity of the superior curved line of the occiput: and the sides being formed by two lines, the one drawn downwards and backwards from the external angular process of the frontal bone to the angle of the lower jaw, the other from the angle of the jaw upwards and backwards to the extremity of the superior curved line. This region is divisible into three portions, temporal, mastoid, and zygomatic. 64.'â€”Side View of the Skull. The Temporal Fossae. The Temporal fossa, is bounded above and behind by the temporal ridge, which extends from the external angular process of the frontal upwards and backwards across the frontal and parietal bones, curving downwards behind to terminate at the root of the zygomatic process. In front, it is bounded by the frontal, malar, and great wing of the sphenoid: externally, by the zygomatic arch, formed con- jointly by the malar and temporal bones; below, it is separated from the zygoma- tic fossa by the pterygoid ridge, seen on the outer surface of the great wing ot the sphenoid. This fossa is formed by five bones, part of the frontal, great wing of the sphenoid, parietal, squamous portion of the temporal, and malar bones, and is traversed by five sutures, the transverse facial, coronal, spheno-parietal, squamo- parietal, and squamo-sphenoidal. It is deeply concave in front, convex behind, traversed by grooves for lodging branches of the deep temporal arteries, and filled by the Temporal muscle.

342 ARTERIES. the artery of the opposite side. These vessels in the mouth are placed one on each side of the frsenum. Surgical Anatomy. The lingual artery may be divided near its origin in cases of cut throat, a complication that not unfrequently happens in this class of wounds, or severe liremorrhage which cannot be restrained by ordinary means, may ensue from a wound, or deep ulcer of the tongue. In the former case, the primary wound may be enlarged if necessary, and the bleeding vessel at once secured. In the latter case, it has been suggested that the lingual artery should be tied near its origin. If the student, however, will observe the depth at which this vessel is placed from the surface, the number of important parts which surround it on every side, and its occasional irregularity of origin, the great difficulty of such an operation will be apparent; under such circumstances, it is more advisable that the external or common carotid should be tied. Troublesome htemorrhage may occur in the division of the froenum in children, if the ranine artery, which lies on each side of it, is cut through. The student should remember that the operation is always to be performed with a pair of blunt-pointed scissors, which should be so held as to divide the part in the direction downwards and backwards ; the ranino artery and veins are then avoided. 209.â€”The Arteries of the Face and Scalp. The Facial Artery (fig. 20g), arises a little above the lingual, and ascends obliquely forwards and upwards, beneath the body of the lower jaw, to the sub- maxillary gland, in which it is imbedded; this may be called the cervical part of the artery. It then curves upwards over the body of the jaw at the anterior inferior angle of the Masseter muscle, ascends forwards and upwards across the cheek to the angle of the mouth, passes up along the side of the nose, and terminates at the inner canthus of the eye, under the name of the angular artery.

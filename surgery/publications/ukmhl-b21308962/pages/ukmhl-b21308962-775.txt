These vessels supply the subcutaneous areolar tissue and the integument, and are accompanied by numerous lymphatic vessels, which return the lymph from the same parts to the inguinal glands. The superficial inguinal glands are arranged in two groups, one of which is disposed parallel with Poupart’s ligament; the other is placed below this ligament, surrounding the termination of the saphenous vein, and following (occasionally) the course of this vessel a short distance along the thigh. The upper chain receives the lymphatic vessels from the penis, scrotum, lower part of the abdomen, perinmum, and buttock; the lower chain receives the lymphatic vessels from the lower extremity. The nerves supplying the integument of this region are derived from the ilio- 383.—Femoral Hernia. Superficial Dissection. inguinal, the genito-crural, and anterior crural. The ilio-iliguinal nerve may be louml on the inner side of the internal saphenous vein, the terminal branch of the genifo-ciural nerve outside the vein, and the middle and external cutaneous nerves more external. flic deep layer of superficial fascia should be divided in the same direction as the external incisions, and separated from the fascia lata; this is easily effected, fiom its extreme thinness. It is a thin but dense membrane, placed beneath the subcutaneous vessels and nerves, and upon the surface of the fascia lata. It is

SPINAL CORD. 257 —Transverse Section of the grey substance of the spinal cord, near the middle of the dorsal region. Magnified 13 diameters. J. L. Clarke, del. <& C°V‘ 473 longitudinal fibres are more superficial, run nearly parallel with each other, and form the greater portion of the white columns. The grey substance of the cord con- sists of, 1. Nerve-fibres of variable, but smaller average diameter than those of the columns. 2. Nerve-cells of various shapes and sizes, with from two to eight processes. 3. Blood-vessels and con- nective tissue. Each lateral half of the grey sub- stance is divided into an anterior and posterior horn, and the tractus inter- medio lateralis, or lateral part of the grey substance between the anterior and posterior cornua. The posterior horn consists of two parts, the caput cornu, or expanded ex- tremity of the horn (fig. 257), round which is the lighter space or lamina, the gelatinous substance; and the cervix cornu, or remaining nai’row portion of the horn, as far forwards as the central canal. The gelatinous substance contains along its border a series of large nerve- cells ; but more internally consists of a stratum of small cells traversed by transverse, oblique, and longitudinal fibres (figs. 258, 259). 258.—Transverse Section of the grey substance of the spinal cord through the middle of the lumbar enlargement. On the left side the groups of large cells are seen; on the right side the course of the fibres without the cells. Magnified 13 diameters. J. L. Clarke, del. tMu/fe gutsbcm Nearly the whole inner half of the cervix is occupied by a remarkable and important column of nerve-cells, called the posterior vesicular column (fig. 257), which varies in size and appearance in different regions of the cord, and is intimately connected with the posterior roots of the nerves.

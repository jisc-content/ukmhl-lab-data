SURGICAL ANATOMY OF FEMORAL HERNIA. 738 sheath, a small oval-shaped interval existing between the femoral vein and the inner wall of the sheath, which is occupied merely by a little loose areolar tissue, and occasionally a small lymphatic gland; this is the crural canal, along which a portion of gut descends in femoral hernia. Gimbernaf s Ligament (fig. 386) is that part of the aponeurosis of the External oblique muscle, which is reflected downwards and outwards to be inserted into the pectineal line of the os pubis. It is about an inch in length, larger in the male than in the female, almost horizontal in direction in the erect posture, and of a triangular form, the base directed outwards. Its base, or outer margin, is concave, thin and sharp, lies in contact with the crural sheath, and is blended with the pubic portion of the fascia lata. Its apex corresponds to the spine of the pubes. Its posterior margin is attached to the pectineal line. Its anterior margin is con- tinuous with Poupart’s ligament. 385.—Femoral Hernia. Iliac Portion of Fascia Lata removed, and Sheath of Femoral Vessels and Femoral Canal exposed. / Crural Sheath. If Poupart’s ligament is divided, the femoral or crural sheath may be demonstrated as a continuation downwards of the fascia: that line the abdomen, the transversalis fascia passing down in front of the femoral vessels, and the iliac fascia descending behind them; these fasciae are directly continuous on the iliac side of the femoral artery, but a small space exists between the femoral vein and the point where they are continuous on the pubic side of this vessel, which constitutes the femoral or crural canal. The femoral sheath is closely

OSTEOLOGY. H In the Eleventh Dorsal, the body approaches in its form and size to the lum- bar. The articular facets for the heads of the ribs, one on each side, are of large size, and placed chiefly on the pedicles, which are thicker and stronger in this and the next vertebra, than in any other part of the dorsal region. The transverse processes are very short, tubercular at their extremities, and have no articular facets for the tubercles of the ribs. The spinous process is short, nearly horizontal in direction, and presents a slight tendency to bifurcation at its extremity. 6.—Peculiar Dorsal Vertebra;.

Free con u cor and turned outward The Twelfth Dorsal has the same general characters as the eleventh; but may be distinguished from it by the inferior articular processes being convex and turned outwards, like those of the lumbar vertebra;; by the general form of the body, laminae, and spinous process, approaching to that of the lumbar vertebrae; and by the transverse processes being shorter, and the tubercles at their extremities more marked.

Its relation with the tonsil should be especially remembered, as instances have occurred in which the artery has been wounded, during the operation of scarifying the tonsil, and fatal haemorrhage has supervened. The branches given off from the internal carotid are: From Petrous Portion . Tympanic. 1 Arteria receptaculi. From Cavernous Portion • Anterior meningeal. ( Ophthalmic. ' ' ' ' il. The cervical portion of the internal carotid gives off no branches. The tympanic is a small branch which enters the cavity of the tympanum, through a minute foramen in the carotid canal, and anastomoses with the tympanic branch of the internal maxillary, and stylo-mastoid arteries. The artericc receptaculi are numerous small vessels, derived from the internal carotid in the cavernous sinus; they supply the pituitary body, the Gasserian ganglion, and the walls of the cavernous and inferior petrosal sinuses. One of these branches, distributed to the dura mater, is called the anterior meningeal; it anastomoses with the middle meningeal. The Ophthalmic Artery arises from the internal carotid, just as that vessel is emerging from the cavernous sinus, on the inner side of the anterior clinoid 213--—The Ophthalmic Artery and its Brauches, the Koof of the Orbit having been removed. process, and enters the orbit through the optic foramen, below, and on the outer side, of the optic nerve. It then crosses above, and to the inner side of this a a 2 From Cerebral Portion Posterior communicating. Anterior choroid.

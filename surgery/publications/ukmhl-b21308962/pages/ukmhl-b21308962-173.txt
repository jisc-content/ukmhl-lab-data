The Lower Extremity, much smaller than the upper, is some- what quadrilateral in form, and prolonged downwards, on its in- ner side, into a strong process, the internal malleolus. The inferior surface of the bone presents a quadrilateral smooth surface, for articulation with the astragalus; narrow internally, where it becomes continuous with the articular surface of the inner malleolus, broader externally, and traversed from before back- wards by a slight elevation, se- parating two lateral depressions. The anterior surface is smooth and rounded above, and covered by the tendons of the Extensor muscles of the toes; its lower margin presents a rough trans- verse depression, for the attach- ment of the anterior ligament of the ankle joint. The posterior surface presents a superficial groove directed obliquely down- wards and inwards, continuous with a similar groove on the pos- terior extremity of the astragalus; it serves for the passage of the tendon of the Flexor longus pollicis. The external surface presents a triangular rough de- pression, the lower part of which, in some bones, is smooth, covered with cartilage in the recent state and articulates with the fibula, the remaining part is rough for the attachment of the inferior interosseous ligament, which connects it with the fibula. This surface is bounded by two prominent ridges, continuous above with the interosseous ridge ; they afford attachment to the anterior and posterior tibio - fibular ligaments. The internal surface is prolonged downwards to form a strong py- ramidal-shaped process, flattened from without inwards, the inner malleolus; its inner surface is convex and subcutaneous.

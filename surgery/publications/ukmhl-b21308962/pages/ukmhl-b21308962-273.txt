ANTERIOR VERTEBRAL REGION. 235 gastric nerve. By its posterior surface, with the Longus colli, the Rectus anticus minor, and the upper cervical vertebrm. The Rectus Capitis Anticus Minor is a short flat muscle, situated immediately beneath the upper part of the preceding. It arises from the anterior surface of the lateral mass of the atlas, and from the root of its transverse process; passing obliquely upwards and inwards, it is inserted into the basilar process immediately behind the preceding muscle. Relations. By its anterior surface, with the Rectus anticus major. By its posterior surface, with the front of the occipito-atlantal articulation. Externally, with the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic. The Rectus Lateralis is a short, flat muscle, situated between the transverse process of the atlas, and the jugular process of the occipital bone. It arises from the upper surface of the transverse process of the atlas, and is inserted into the under surface of the jugular process of the occipital bone. Relations. By its anterior surface, with the internal jugular vein. By its posterior surface, with the vertebral artery. 158.â€”The Pre-Vertebral Muscles. The Longus Colli is a long, flat muscle, situated on the anterior surface of the spine, between the atlas and the third dorsal vertebra, being broad in the middle, narrow and pointed at each extremity. It consists of three portions, a superior oblique, an inferior oblique, and a vertical portion. The superior oblique portion arises from the anterior tubercles of the transverse processes of the third, fourth, and fifth cervical vertebrm; and, ascending obliquely inwards, is inserted by a narrow tendon into the tubercle on the anterior arch of the atlas.

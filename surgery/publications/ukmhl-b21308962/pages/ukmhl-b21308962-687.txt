647 STRUCTURE OF LIVER. The fibrous coat lies beneath the serous investment, and covers the entire surface of the organ. It is difficult of demonstration, excepting where the serous coat is deficient. At the transverse fissure, it is continuous with the capsule of Glisson; and, on the surface of the organ, with the areolar tissue separating the lobules. The lobules form the chief mass of the hepatic substance: they may be seen either on the surface of the organ, or by making a section through the gland. They are small granular bodies, about the size of a millet-seed, measuring from one-twentieth to one-tenth of an inch in diameter. When divided longitudinally, they have a foliated margin, and, if trans- versely, a polygonal outline. The bases of the lobules are clustered round the smallest branches (sub-lobular) of the hepatic veins, to which each is connected by means of a small branch, which issues from the centre of the lobule (intra- lobular). The remaining part of the sur- face of each lobule is imperfectly isolated from the surrounding lobules, by a thin stratum of areolar tissue, and by the smaller vessels and ducts. If one of the hepatic veins be laid open, the bases of the lobules may be seen through the .thin wall of the vein, on which they rest, arranged in the form of a tessellated pavement, the centre of each polygonal space presenting a mi- nute aperture, the mouth of a sublobular vein. Each lobule is composed of a mass of cells ; of a plexus of biliary ducts ; of a venous plexus, formed by branches of the portal vein ; of a branch of an he- patic vein (intralobular); of minute arteries; and probably, of nerves and lymphatics. The hepatic cells form the chief mass of the substance of a lobule, and lie in the interspaces of the capillary plexus, being probably contained in a tubular network, which forms the origin of the biliary ducts. The smallest branches of the vena portae pass between the lobules, around which they form a plexus, the interlobular. Branches from this plexus enter the lobules, and form a network in their circumference. The radicles of the portal vein communicate with those of the hepatic vein, which occupy the centre of the lobule; and the latter converge to form the intralobular vein, which issues from the base of the lobule, and joins the hepatic vein. The portal vein carries the blood to the liver, from which the bile is secreted; the hepatic vein carries h (sub-lobular), situated in the centre of the lobules.

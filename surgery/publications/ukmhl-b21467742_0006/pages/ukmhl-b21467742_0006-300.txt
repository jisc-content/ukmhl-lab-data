MEDICINE, HISTORY OF 282 Institute in the University of Berlin, whither he had been translated in 1856, and published it in 1858. Refuting previous notions of the fibrillary or granular structure of tissues and of the evolution of cells in fluids, he showed and boldly maintained that cells were characteristic of living organisms and were, in fact, the living and independent, though mutually related, imits of which all living things were composed ; themselves produced solely from pre-existent cells—oiiinis celhda e celluld—and self-sufficient for all purposes in unicellular organisms, they formed in the higher a social organisation, building up the tissues by the differentiation of their walls, of their contents, or of the solids or liquids which they deposited or exuded, as intercellular substances—previously known as the matrix or the plasma, from the erroneous notion that the cells originated in it—and by further specialisation exercising the most diverse functions from those of excretion, secretion, and movement to the highest manifestations of sensibility, intelligence, and volition. Their growth and decay, proliferation and death undei-lay the phenomena of atrophy and hyper- " trophy, hyperplasia, degeneration, hetei'oplasia and metamorphosis that constituted disease, which was to be sought not in organs or tissues, but in the individual and component cells, some of which might be healthy while others around were diseased; and the causes of their disease might be due to defective nutrition, to the abnormal condition of others variously correlated with them, or to the absorption by the cells of poisons in the nutrient fluids. Among other pathological phenomena, the true nature of which we owe to Virchow, may be mentioned those of neoplasms, thrombosis, and embolism, septicsemia and pysemia, so- called metastases, and the physiological aspects of heredity. Pathology alone was, however, too narrow a field for the genius of this extra- ordinary man, whose superabundant energy found room for its exercise in archaeology, ethnology, anthropology, and even political and municipal activity, and whose physical and intellectual vigour is undiminished in his eightieth year.^ The four signs given by Celsus as constituting or indicative of inflammation, '■'■dolor, color, rubor, twnior" were accepted by everyone until within the memory of the younger men of the present generation. Since local stimula- tion led to increased nutritive activity, inflam- mation as a frequent result of irritation was looked on as an extreme form of the same. It was Lister who first suggested that there was rather a lowered vitality in the part, and though the dilatation of the capillaries, stasis, adhesion of the white corpuscles to the walls, and transudation of the blood serum had been observed by Wharton Jones and others, it was 1 Virchow died in 1902 at the age of 81. Cohnheim who first demonstrated the migration of the leucocytes through the walls of the vessels, and Metschnikof who traced their subsequent activity as scavenger cells, to be devoured in their turn by larger phagocytes; while further researches have shown the con- nection between leucocytes and pus corpuscles, and between connective-tissue cells, macro- phagocytes, and granulation tissue. As scien- tific generalisation brings apparently diverse phenomena together under simple laws by distinguishing the accidental from the essential, the signs of Celsus have one by one been rejected, and processes having at first sight little, if anything, in common are shown to be but forms of inflammation, the differences being dependent on the structure and functions of the part; while inflammation is neither an excess of vital activity nor in itself a disease, but rather an effort of nature at self-preservation, the repair of injury, or the elimination of a poison, albeit often misdirected and failing in the attainment of its ends. These advances had for the most part been made on more or less well-known lines, as the natural result of patient observation and re- search ; but with the discovery of the bacillus anthracis a wholly new world of knowledge was revealed, the entire character of a great part of scientific medicine completely transformed, and boundless possibilities opened to the view. The pioneers in this revolution were not medical men; Robert Boyle, two hundred years before, had, with a flight of scientific imagination little short of prophetic inspiration, written—" He that thoroughly imderstands the nature of ferments and fermentation shall probably be much better able than he that ignores them to give a fair account of several diseases, as well fevers as others, which will perhaps never be thoroughly understood without an insight into the doctrine of fermentation." Micro- scopists from Leeuwenhoek and Ehrenberg to Cohn, de Bary and Naegeli had studied the protozoa and minute fungi now known as bacteria, which for a long time were supposed to belong to the same class as the former by those who looked on movement and locomotion as characteristic of animals as distinguished from plants, and conjecture as to their connection with diseases had been rife. Plenciz of Vienna had, indeed, formulated a theory of a contagium vivum for each of the specific infectious diseases. But the first accurate observations had been made with a view of verifying or refuting the doctrine of abiogenesis. In 1857 Pasteur, a French chemist, took up the subject of fermentation at the point where it had been left by Cagniard-Latour and Schwann, and demonstrated the dependence on bacterial activity, not only of all fermentation, but of every process of decomposition of organic matter and its conversion or reduction to the

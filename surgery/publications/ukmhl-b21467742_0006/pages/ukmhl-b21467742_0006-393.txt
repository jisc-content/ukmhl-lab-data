371 METEOROLOGY this case had the third and fourth lines seemed to coincide with lines on the scale the reading would have been the mean of 29'686 and 29-688, i.e. 29-687.1 There is another form, the siphon barometer, which requires no correction for capacity or capillarity. It is a simple J-shaped tube : the longer leg closed above, and containing the Torricellian vacuum, represents the tube of the ordinary form, while the shorter and open leg corresponds to the cistern ; but the calibre being uniform throughout, the movement of the mercury, though in opposite directions, is equal in each leg, and the mercury in the longer having to support the atmosphere + the com- plementary or surplus mercury in the other, the height of the column is but half what it is in the cistern barometer. The zero is a point midway between the extremities, and a scale and vernier are attached to each leg, those on the longer graduated upwards, and those on the shorter or open one downwards. The atmo- spheric pressure is obtained by adding the two readings. With the recent improvements of a capillary connection between the legs, a lateral orifice instead of the open mouth of the shorter, and a Brunton's pipette to prevent the possibility of tlie vacuum being broken, it cannot get out of order, and is well adapted for the determina- tion of altitudes in mountain ascents or for use on board ship. Corrections.—The index error, if any, and the correction for capillarity, are marked for every half-inch on Kew certificates. Correction for temperature by which all readings are reduced to what they would be at zero (0° C. or 32° F.), is calculated from the coefficients of expansion of mercury and of brass, the material of the scale, by Schuhmacher's formula. This correction eliminates the disturbing iniiuence of tempera- ture on the materials of the instrument, but does not affect that on the atmosphere, in the pressure exerted by which it and humidity are the efficient factors. The results, as applied to barometers with brass scales extending from the cistern to the summit of the tube, are given in the following table for 27 and 30 inches, and for every 10° F. above freezing-point. Those for intermediate heights and temperatures may be found by proportional parts with approximate accuracy. Temp. 27 in. 30 in.

O'OS or twenty-fourths of an inch), each of the former is less than one of the latter by A, i-e. by .jV x 5-V = rs-ij = 0'002 of an inch. Correction for Altitvde.—The mercury falls approximately yttott inch = 0 001 inch for each foot above the sea-level, subject to a slight varia- tion dependent on temperature and humidity. The following table gives the addition in inches at 30 and 27 inches of pressure and 0°, 40°, and 80° F. for 10, 100, and 1000 feet of altitude. Intermediate heights are calculated propor- tionately. The Ordnance standard is the sea- level at mid-tide at Liverpool. Height in Feet. Temperature of External Air. 0° F. 40° F. 80° F.

They are from their portability and sensitiveness espe- cially convenient for measuring heights in sur- veying and in ascending mountains, for which the differences between the readings in hundredths of an inch x 9 may be taken as the elevation in feet, since at ordinary temperatures O'l inch corre- sponds approximately to differences of 90 feet. A remarkable effect of variations of atmo- spheric pressure, of considerable interest from a medical point of view, is their influence on the movements of the ground air; or that contained between the particles of pervious soils, which not being immediately affected by changes in the temperature and humidity of the external atmosphere, remain for a time at a higher or lower density. The effect of a sudden fall of the barometer, i.e. of a rarefaction of the atmosphere, is an escape of the hitherto com- pressed ground air; and that of a rapid rise, on the other hand, is a descent of the atmo- spheric air into the earth, until the underground pressure or density and that above are equalised. This is the explanation of the phenomenon of the " blowing wells" at Northallerton, from which a strong outward current of air issues during and for some time after a fall of the barometer, and into which a like current rushes during and after a rise.

279 MEDICINE, HISTORY OF published in 1793. Two Scottish physicians of this period call for a passing notice as the last of the systematists: Wm. Cullen, who, taking up Haller's doctrine of irritability, constructed a Nosology or Classification of Diseases, in which irritability, muscular or more often nervous, was made to explain all; and John Brown (1735- 1782), who, though not held in much repute in England and France, achieved an extraordinary but short-lived fame in his own Scotland, in Germany—where the speculative and imagina- tive tendency of an intellectual activity, culti- vated in an atmosphere of philosophic schools, craved for a system that should explain all the mysteries of nature—and in Italy, where, with the loss of national spirit, both literature and science were showing symptoms of decay. Ac- cording to the Brunonian system, as it was called, all the phenomena of life and of mind were mani- festations of excitability evoked by extrinsic or intrinsic causes, excess—or, more often, defects— of this constituting diseases, which were there- fore divisible into sthenic and asthenic, the latter comprising 97 per cent of the whole, and calling for stimulating methods of treatment, a con- clusion that had at least the advantage of provoking a reaction against the violent anti- phlogistic methods then in vogue. It may have been this consideration that led to the popularity the Brunonian system attained in America, throvigh the advocacy of so sober a physician as Benjamin Rush. Solid and lasting work was, however, achieved during the eighteenth century by the Italian anatomists and pathologists, Valsalva, Lancisi, and others in the earlier period, and in the later by the English physicians, John Fothergill (1712-1780), who first described diphtheria under the name of " putrid sore- throat," by John Huxham (1694-1768) in his researches on epidemic fevers, and by John Pringle (1707-1782), whose work on those prevalent in camps and prisons, and embodied in a treatise on The Diseases of an Army, was translated into several languages, and, long the standai-d authority on this subject, may even now be studied with interest. Two discoveries, that of auscultation in the diagnosis of diseases of the lungs and pleura by Auenbrugger of Vienna (1722-1809), published in his Inventum Novum in 1761, and that of vaccination by Edward Jenner in the last year of the century, met with very different recep- tions. Auenbrugger, who practised immediate percussion of the chest-walls with the finger of one hand only, was treated with ridicule or neglect until just before his death, when Corvisart translated his Inventum into French, and the aged physician found himself famous. Jenner's substitution of vaccination for inocula- tion was, on the other hand, received with enthusiasm and rewarded by grants of ,£30,000 from Parliament; nor was it till two or three generations had enjoyed the blessing of this discovery, and the face of humanity had literally been changed, that, save among the most ignorant classes, any serious opposition was raised to the practice : and while, not only in Germany and Scandinavia, but in Servia and Japan, vaccination and revaccination are enforced by law, in England alone, the land of his birth, has compulsion been practically abandoned. Inoculation of smallpox, practised in the East from time immemorial, had been introduced into England in 1721, but it was found that, though the disease thus artificially induced was so mild as to be very rarely fatal, the total mortality was swollen by the deaths of others who con- tracted the infection from those who were thus rendered insusceptible for the future, while it was obviously impossible to extirpate the disease by a process that involved the maintenance of a succession of cases. For this Jenner substituted the inoculation of a virus that had, by having been passed through an animal to which it was foreign, been so profoundly modified as to be no longer communicable save by actual insertion, and been converted into a local lesion devoid of all danger to life, yet retaining in its attenuated form enough of its original character as to confer an immunity against the normal disease scarcely inferior to that imparted by smallpox itself. Later experience has, however, shown a deteriora- tion of the strain as regards the duration of the protection, and it has been proved by experi- ment that to obtain results equal to those of Jenner recourse must be had to inoculation of the cow with smallpox, thus securing a lymph of pristine energy. This period saw the rise of homoeopathy, the most fantastic and imintelligible system of medicine ever propounded, which, while pre- tending to present a complete explanation of disease, outrages reason and common - sense. Had it been of the nature of a reaction against the polypharmacy of the traditional therapy, the indiscriminate stimulation of Brown, or the reckless depletion of Broussaiss, Hahnemann would have sought his arguments from the solid evidence of physiology and pathology, instead of which he treated all inquiry into the causes of phenomena as utterly useless, maintaining that the symptoms themselves constituted the disease, and that, as such, they and they alone called for attention, forgetting that every effect must have a cause, and that various combinations of symp- toms imply a plurality of causes and presumably indicate different treatment. He rejected all beliefs in the vis medicatrix naturae, enunciating as the sole rule of practice the doctrine of similia similihus curantur, implied in the name of homoeopathy. By this he meant that a disease —that is to say, a certain aggregate or combina- tion of symptoms—would be cured by the administration of a drug, if such could be found, capable of giving rise in a healthy person to a similar association of symptoms; though he did

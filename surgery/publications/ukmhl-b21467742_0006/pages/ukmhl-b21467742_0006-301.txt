MEDICINE, HISTOKY OF 283 inorganic state, and showed that every form of septicaemia, surgical and puerperal, was due to the absorption of the products of the putrefaction of dead organic matter into the living body. On this discovery Lister based his practice of antiseptic treatmen'foT'Avounds and the performance of surgical operations, whenever practicable, under aseptic conditions. The results of this have changed the whole aspect of surgery, reducing the mortality, danger, and difficulty of all operations, and rendering possible and comparatively free from risk a large number of others, as those involving opening of the abdomen or cranium, which had previously been so fatal as to be deemed un- justifiable. Meanwhile, Pollender having in 1855 published his discovery (in 1849) of the constant presence of rod-like bodies in the blood of animals dying of anthrax, Davaine suggested a causal relation. Hitherto, and indeed until 1870 or later, all bacteria had been looked on as accidental variations of one and the same organism, or as spores or phases of some of the higher fungi; but Davaine, finding that, by the inoculation of these into healthy animals, he could produce anthrax only, and, by that of those of " ordinary putrefactions," septicsemia in some of its forms, concluded that these two, at any rate, were causative and specific. Still no further progress was made until the seventies, when KocljL introduced the use of solid media in place of tli^ culture fluids employed by Pasteur and all previous observers. By the addition of just enough gelatine to solidify the broth or other nutrient fluid at the usual temperatures, it became possible to transplant single colonies on the pohit of a needle to fresh tubes, and thus obtaining pure cultures of each bacillus or coccus to study the conditions of pabulum, reaction, temperature, and presence or absence of oxygen, best for each; their power of liquefying the gelatine, of evolving gases, acids, etc., and the results of their inoculation into living animals; while the discovery by Ehi-lich and others that bacilli and cocci, morphologically indistinguishable, could be easily differentiated by their behaviour towards various stains, especially of the aniline group, dispelled the last shadows of uncertainty attaching to microscopic observations and physiological experiments. Koch identified the bacilli of cholera and tuberculosis; Finkler and Prior those of other diarrhoeal diseases; Klebs and Loeffler that of diphtheria ; Eberth and Gaffky, of enteric fever ; Obermeier, of relapsing fever; Cantani and Nicolaier, of tetanus; Pfeiffer, of influenza; Friedlander, of pneumonia; Kitasato and Yersin, of plague, while others did the same for the microbes of a number of diseases of animals, especially of horses, cattle, swine, and fowls. Many were shown to be engaged in the process of reducing organic matter to its ultimate inorganic constituents, and some always present in the animal secretions to be innocent, or, as the B. coli, capable under special conditions of acquiring pathogenic properties, while patho- genic forms might in like manner lose and resume their virulence. Some of these are pathogenic to man or to certain animals only; others to several or all alike. Some are capable of growing and multiplying in the living body only ; others have also an extracorporeal and independent existence, the diseases to which they give rise being, with one exception at any rate—that of tetanus—communicable to other individuals. There remain a number of specific and communicable diseases, which all analogy compels us to look on as microbic, but of which the cocci, whether from their minuteness or the failure as yet to cultivate them in artificial media, have not been identified with any certainty. The influence of these discoveries on our views as to the etiology and pathology of specific and communicable diseases, and on preventive measures and disinfection, has been great; but that of the further developments of bacteriology on prophylaxis and the treatment of disease in the individual promises still greater results. Pasteur had found that by cultivating bacteria under unfavourable conditions he could obtain what he called attenuated virus, the inoculation of which conferred a degree of insusceptibility to stronger or to natural in- fection. The most unequivocal success some- what remarkably followed the peculiar procedure practised by him in the case of rabies, the microbe of which he, at any rate, failed to discover, and in which he employed living rabbits in place of artificial culture fluids. But with anthrax, rouget, etc., the impossibility of standardising his virus and the attendant risks of excess or defect were such as obviously to preclude the application of his methods to the diseases of man. Meanwhile there was a con- sensus among bacteriologists and pathologists that the immediate cause of the phenomena of fevers, etc., was the action of a poison formed by the bacteria in the animal fluids, as alcohol is in a saccharine solution by the growth of the yeast fungus. Roux and Yersin verified this in the case of diphtheria, the sterilised or filtered culture fluids of the bacilli, when inoculated, inducing all the phenomena of the disease ex- cept the exudation, and its communicability to other animals. The problems of immunity were taken up in earnest by Behring and Kitasato, who came to the conclusion that resistance to subsequent reinfection, as well as the spontaneous termination of specific diseases, was due to the production by the cells of the infected animal under the influence of the toxin of an antidote or antitoxin, and that the degree of resistance to the effects of the poison presented by any animal not wholly insusceptible depended on the quantity and rapidity of production of the

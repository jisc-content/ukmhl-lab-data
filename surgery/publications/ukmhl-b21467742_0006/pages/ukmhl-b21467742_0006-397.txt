The two tables preceding give (A) the weight of a cubic foot of vapour at each degree Fahrenheit from 0° to 100°, or the weight that constitutes saturation, the temperature being the dew-point at 30 inches of barometric pressure, and (B) Glaisher's factors for all temperatures from 0° to 100° F. Mr. Glaisher has constructed also a series of elaborate and highly accurate tables, giving the expansion of dry air by heat, the elastic force of aqueous vapour in inches of mercury, the expansion of a volume of dry air when satu- rated with vapour, and the weights of a cubic foot of dry air, of vapour, and of saturated air, all calculated for the pressure of 30 inches of mercury, and for each degree Fahrenheit from 0° to 10(/, together with empirical factors for correction of results at great altitudes, obtained by observations made during his balloon ascents. These, with full instructions for the use of the general tables, and the additions and corrections to be made in the results under certain circum- stances, as when the differences between the readings of the wet and dry bulbs are consider- able, are published by Taylor & Francis of Fleet Street, London, price 2s. 6d., and are indispens- able to the regular observer, though the shorter tables given here will be sufficient when extreme accuracy is not necessary. Dew and Frost—Fog and Mist Evaporation, in nature, depends less on the temperature of the air than on its relative humidity and consequent capacity for taking up more moisture; it is therefore aided by winds which carry off the air as it tends towards saturation, and replace it by drier. Evaporation lowers the temperature of the air and of the surface soil, since all matters in passing from the solid to the liquid, or from this to the gaseous state, abstract heat from their surroundings, which they give off during the reverse transition. Thus a heavy fall of snow is attended by a perceptible rise of tem- perature, and the " raw " cold that accompanies a thaw is well known. Thus, too, is produced the refreshing coolness that follows a shower, or the use of the water-cart or hose in hot dry weather; and an east wind feels colder than another of the same temperature, and favours more the formation of ice, because its greater dryness increases evaporation from the exposed surfaces of the body and from sheets of water. Deiv is the precipitated vapour from the lowest stratum of the air chilled by the rapid radiation from the earth under a clear sky. It is not formed when radiation is checked by overhanging clouds, or a strong wind maintains a constant renewal of the air. Hoar frost is not frozen dew, but ice deposited under like conditions, save as regards temperature, just as snow is not rain frozen in its fall, but the form assumed by cloud vapour precipitated at low temperatures. Fog and Mist.—The formation of fog, unlike that of dew, is favoured by a moderate move- ment of the air, and indirectly by irregularity of the surface of a district. It results from the rapid cooling of large masses of air below their dew-points, the excess of vapour being con- densed, but not precipitated as rain or snow. Fog is therefore formed by the same causes as, when intensified, produce rain : (1) the mingling of volumes of warm humid air and cold dry air (provided the temperature of the mixture be below its dew-point); (2) the sudden chilling of vapour-laden air when it (a) impinges on cold hill-tops or cliffs, or {h) passes over land cooled by evaporation, as wet clay soils, or (c) the surface of lakes (provided the water be colder than the moving air). Mists formed over run- ning streams in frosty weather are, however, due to the condensation of the vapour rising from the warmer water, and those iu valleys and over damp meadows are caused in many instances by the colder, and therefore heavier

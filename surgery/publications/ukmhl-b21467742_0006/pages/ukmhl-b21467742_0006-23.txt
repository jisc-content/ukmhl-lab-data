9 LUNACY per cent; shoemakers, 12 per cent; medical men, carmen, and carters, 10 per cent; butchers and tradespeople generally, 14 per cent; railway, telegraph, police, and domestic servants, 9 per cent. On the other hand, there has been a diminution in liability to insanity among the following occupations, amounting to, in the case of laundry-keepers and washerwomen, 15 per cent; bank and insurance subordinates, farmers, etc., 8 per cent. Among carpenters, fishermen, merchants, handicraftsmen, the rise does not exceed that warranted by population. In most of the other occupations, including agricultu- ral labourers, shepherds, gamekeepers, teachers, tailors, etc., the percentage has remained station- ary and not reached what might have been expected. A table such as this, compiled with care, could not fail to be of service in showing approximately in what callings insanity was increasing. Forms of Mental Disorder.—These are referred to in order to show the numbers sulfering from each of the three or four principal types of mental disease, how the sexes are relatively affected, and in which types there is a falling off or an increase. Such an analysis of statistics referable to 81,670 cases may be of some help in an attempt to explain the growth of lunacy. In England, among the pauper insane, mania accounts for 47 "8 per cent, the sex ratio being 100 : 102 ; melancholia, 28'5 per cent, the sex ratio being 100 :148 ; and general paralysis of the insane, 7 '6 per cent. Both sexes seem equally liable to mania, females more to melancholia. The sex ratio for all is 100 : 105. Comparing the quinquenniad 1894-98 with its immediate pre- decessor, mania has decreased by 1 '8 per cent; general paralysis by 1 per cent; while melan- cholia has increased by 2'2, and senile dementia by "5 per cent. Considering the large number of senile dements, this increase is of some moment. General paralysis among males between thirty- five and forty-four years of age reaches 24*7 per cent of all admissions between these ages, and 18-9 per cent between forty-five and fifty-four years of age. On the other hand, of the ad- mission for general paralysis alone, 25 per cent was between forty-five and fifty-four years, 45 per cent between thirty-five and forty-four years of age (the most liable period), and 21 per cent between twenty-five and thirty-four years. In Scotland, from an analysis of 9000 ad- missions to large asylums, mania falls to be credited with 43 per cent, and melancholia with 30 per cent. The sex ratio for all was 100 : 100, but for mania 100 : 108, melancholia 100 : 124, and dementia 100 : 100. There were great differences in evidence both in the percentages of the forms of mental disorder and the sex ratio of the admissions to the different asylums, mania and melancholia being expressed in one asylum by 58 and 37 per cent respectively, in another 33 and 41 per cent : sex ratios for mania in one asylum 100 : 70, in another 100 : 150 ; and for melancholia in one 100 : 218, in another 100 : 100. Moral and Physical Causes.—In the English returns there appears a table assigning the causes of lunacy in the case of 80,000 admitted to asylums during 1894-98. In the construction of such a return considerable latitude has to be allowed as to accuracy. Among private patients the percentages allocated to the principal causes were—(1) intemperance (m. 20"8, f. 9"2) ; (2) hereditary influence (m. 19-9, f. 27-1) ; (3) domestic trouble and adverse circumstances (m. 12'8, f. I4'7); (4) mental anxiety and worry (m. 14'5, f. Il'I) ; (5) sexual excess and venereal diseases (m. 11 "7, f. 1'7) ; (6) other bodily dis- eases (m. 9-1, f. 11-2); (7) old age (m. 3-9, f. 4"5) ; and (8) parturition, puerperal, menopause, etc., 16"3. Among pauper patients the percent- ages for males and females respectively may be expressed as follows: intemperance, 224 and 9'4 ; hereditary influence, 20 and 25'3 ; other bodily diseases, 14*2 and 12'7 ; domestic troubles and adverse circumstances, 10'8 and 12-6 ; old age, 6'7 and 8"1 ; sexual excess and venereal diseases, 4*7 and 1"2 ; and parturition, etc., 12"9. Among private patients hereditary influence, intemperance, love affairs including seduction, and religious excitement, are much more dis- astrous to females than males, while the reverse is the case as to sex in the matter of intemper- ance, sexual excess, and venereal disease. Com- paring the effect of these causes upon the two classes, it would appear that domestic trouble, mental anxiety, love affairs, sexual excess and venereal disease weigh much more heavily on the private class, while the reverse holds good as to the influence of old age, bodily disorders, and privation, which leave their mark on the pauper class. Love affairs, including seduction, tell more disastrously on the well-to-do class. Intemperance and hereditary influence is equally injurious in both classes. Again, comparing this quinquenniad with its immediate prede- cessor, there is among the private class an appreciable increase in the percentage of those whose insanity is attributed to domestic trouble, mental anxiety, intemperance, sexual excess and venereal disease, old age, and bodily disorders. Among the lunatic poor, intemperance, old age, sexual and venereal disease exhibit an upward tendency ; while domestic trouble and adverse circumstances show a slight decrease, for which a possible and partial explanation may be found in the better distribution of wealth and, as a result, better conditions of living. A careful consideration of the main causes producing insanity is of value when the question of the growth of lunacy in the country as a whole or in a large area is being investigated. Is Lunacy Increasing?—The answering of this question involves the putting of several others, one of which is—If there be an increase,

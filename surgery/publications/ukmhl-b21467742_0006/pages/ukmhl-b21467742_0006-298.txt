HISTORY OF 280 MEDICINE, not care to explain why the artificially-induced disease should have this effect, instead of aggra- vating the condition of the sufferer, or, on the principle of Satan casting out Satan, leaving him in statu quo ante. He denounced all others as allopaths, or men who acted on the vulgar notion that the addition of like (plus and minus) quantities resulted in zero, and that opposite forces tended to produce equilibrium. As a matter of fact, the only illustrations homoeo- pathists can adduce, as the value of castor-oil in diarrhoea, are apparent, not real; and the action of aconite, of which they make such constant use in febrile conditions, is the most brilliant example of " allopathic " treatment one could find in the whole range of materia medica. But his appeal from the judgment of the pro- fession to the laity, and his assurance that, the simple recognition of outward and visible signs being all that is necessary, the man in the street is as competent as the most learned physi- ologist to decide on the merits of the system, and to some extent to practise it, has by flatter- ing their self-esteem secured for it a popularity chiefly among ladies and men whose education has been wholly literary, and given it a per- manency that it could not otherwise have obtained. Hahnemann professed to have dis- covered and verified the alleged properties or effects of his drugs by observations on himself and other persons in health, but it is evident that the results were for the most part precon- ceived or imaginary. He next proclaimed the still more astounding doctrine of " potentialities," which was that the therapeutic action of a drug increased, inversely as its toxic energy, with dilution, especially if accompanied by agitation or trituration. He accordingly reduced his " mother" tinctures to one-fiftieth of their original strength, and repeated this dilution until he reached and employed by preference that represented by the 30th power of 50 ! His later extravagances were worthy of the inmate of a madhouse, and it is almost needless to say that even his fundamental dogma of similia simiWms has been renounced in practice, and though the "globules" sold to the public may often be inert, "homoeopathic physicians" now are merely such in name, using the same drugs for the same purposes and in the same doses as other practitioners, but finding it expedient to keep up the appearance of heterodoxy by restricting themselves to special modes of administration, and would be disowned by Hahnemann as sailing under false colours. The history of medicine in the nineteenth century has on the whole been one of unbroken progress in scientific investigation and rational empiricism. Especially has this been the case in this country, for the French school, which reached its highest position in the second and third quarters of the century, has recently begun to show indications of decline; while Italy, until the last quarter far behind her neighbours, has rapidly come to the front, more than recalling her glories of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries; and Germany, where, save in Vienna, the old barren dogmatism and scholastic methods long held sway, awoke in the forties from her lethargy, and by combining the exact clinical observation of the English school with unbounded devotion to the pursuit of every department of science, the endowment of original research and lavish expenditure on laboratories—attracting students and teachers from every country in Europe, from America and Japan—as well as the rebuilding of hos- pitals in every town on the most recent models, has established her position without a rival as the instructress of the world, thus obliterating all national differences, imparting her methods to and impressing her character on the science and medicine of other lands, which thus become year by year more uniform and cosmopolitan in every essential feature and aspect. The progress of the science and art of medicine in the nineteenth century has not merely been unin- terrupted, it has been marked by a continuous acceleration; and may be divided into three periods, each exhibiting a distinctive character. The first, from 1800 to about 1840, was one of slow but steady improvement in clinical methods and in the development of pathological anatomy; in the second, from 1840 to 1880, a great impetus was given to it by the brilliant discoveries of physiologists and chemists, especially in the de- partments of organic and synthetic chemistry; while in the third, from 1880 to the present day, the creation of a new science, that of bac- teriology, has effected a revolution in our con- ceptions of a large and yearly-increasing number of diseases, and has opened up a boundless vista of possibilities in preventive and curative medicine. In the first period the French school took the foremost place alike in the methods of clinical observation and in the development of patho- logical anatomy by Bayle, Andral, Chomel, Cruveilhier, and Louis. Corvisart had in 1808 recalled from oblivion Auenbrugger's discovery of immediate percussion, which Piorry improved by introducing the mediate method; while Laennec completed the art of physical examina- tion of the lungs and heart by the invention of the stethoscope as an aid to auscultation, in 1819 —propounding also the first theory of tubercu- losis ; Louis was the first to distinguish enteric, or, as he unfortunately called it, typhoid, fi'om typhus fever; Bretonneau investigated the nature of diphtheria, giving it this name; and as a clinical teacher Trousseau was second to none, except perhaps Graves of Dublin, whose lectures he acknowledged as the models of his own. Laennec's work in the physical examina- tion of the lungs and heart was taken up and further developed by Latham and Hope in England and Stokes of Dublin; and Richard

MEDICINE, HISTORY OF 285 of lesions, as caries of the vertebrae, lupus, etc., previously supposed to have nothing in common; and showed, too, that cold and damp, dust, and defective ventilation were not efficient causes of tuberculosis, but conditions conducive thereto by reducing the power of resistance and facilitating infection with the bacillus. The bearing of these facts on the prevention and treatment of consumption is obvious; but it is interesting to notice how the general improve- ments in the dwellings and the standard of living, and the better ventilation and conditions of workshops, had effected a great reduction in the general mortality from phthisis long before the explanation was discovered. One form alone, that of intestinal tuberculosis in infants, has become more prevalent pari 2mssii with the increased use of the milk of cows, among whom tuberculosis is appallingly genei'al. More restricted in its bearings, but even more unexpected and astonishing in its theoreti- Jl^ t.y^i'^nd practical aspects, is the latest discovery of the past century as to the nature of the so-called malarial or paludal fevers. Drs. Manson and Bancroft had proved by observation and experi- ment the presence in the blood in certain tropi- cal diseases of minute nematoid worms or filarise, and that they passed one phase of their exist- ence in the bodies of certain species of gnats, by the bites of which they obtained entrance into the human body. But the apparent dependence of malarial diseases on telluric and meteorological conditions of soil, temperature, and moisture seemed obvious, and to be con- firmed by the effect of drainage and cultivation in ultimately extinguishing these diseases, or at least in ameliorating their severity. Not unnaturally, the Italian bacteriologists set themselves to the search for a hypothetical bacillus malaricB in the soil and water of the Roman Campagna, until Laveran announced the discovery of a hoematozoon, to which he gave the name of Plasmodium, and the connection between these, of which several distinct varieties were soon recognised, and the phenomena of the disease was universally accepted, though all endeavours to detect it in the soil or water were unsuccessful. The analogy between filariasis and malaria, as diseases caused by hsematozoa, suggested to an Indian army surgeon, Majoi: Ronald Ross, a similar cycle of existence in the mosquito and the man, for the parasite of the latter, as had been proved by Manson in the case of filariasis, and it was not long before he traced the development of the plasmodia through their asexual and sexual phases passed success- fully in the bodies of the anopheles and of man, attacking the red corpuscles of his blood and inducing ansemia, icterus, and hsemoglobinuria. The inquiry was eagerly taken up by Grassi, Bignami, Celli, and others in Italy, who showed by experiment that so long as men were pro- tected from the bites of the anopheles they might expose themselves with impunity to the night air in the most pestilential localities ; and, on the other hand, they could induce attacks in the healthiest situations by voluntarily submit- ting to be bitten by infected anopheles brought from a distance and imprisoned in the rooms in which they slept. Ross and Annett in West, and the brothers Plehn in East Africa, with others in Australasia and elsewhere, have brought a mass of compara- tive observations to bear on the elucidation of the problem, the complexity of which grows with our knowledge. Much remains to be learned as to the distribution and habits of the several species of anopheles, the significance of the various forms of plasmodium, the relations, if any, between the two, and so on; but this appears certain, that the physical conditions hitherto supposed to be conducive to malaria are simply those required by the anopheles, and are of themselves powerless to cause it; that the three factors of the anopheles, men, and Plasmodia, are equally necessary, no malaria being possible in the absence of any one, but appearing so soon as the " missing link" is supplied. It is obvious that the extermination of the anopheles would be followed by the dis- appearance of the disease, and there is every reason to believe that in islands, if not also over well-defined continental areas, this might be effected by the persevering destruction of the larvse and the obliteration of the standing waters constituting their breeding-places, a task which their peculiar habits render far easier than it would be in the case of the culices and other gnats, if, indeed, it might not be possible to call in the aid of some of the numerous parasites, fungoid, and others to which insects are specially prone. Recent researches have thus shown that there are other pathogenic organisms than bacteria, the havoc wrought by htematozoa far exceeding that of all the higher entozoa and parasites, animal and vegetable, hitherto known ; also that there is a closer association than had been suspected between the diseases of man and those of the lower animals, even when not communi- cetble and common to both. ^Surgery has made greater progress in the last half of the century than in the two thousand years preceding, the only important innovation in the past having been the substitution of the ligation of arteries for the cautery and pressure. Being essentially an art, its advances have been rather of the nature of improved methods and manipulations than in research, save so far as the discoveries of physiologists have exerted an influence on practice. But with the introduc- tion of anfesthetics operative surgery lost its terrors, and rapidity of execution gave way to care and accuracy in details, procedures previ- ously excluded on account of the time required for their performance coming into favour.

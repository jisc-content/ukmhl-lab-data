227 MEASLES viscera are softened, often somewhat enlarged, and prone to putrefaction. In cases complicated by diphtheria the Klebs- LofBer bacillus can be detected in the exudation. Caseation of the bronchial glands and of small areas in the lungs are frequently found as the result of a broncho-pneumonia engendered by measles. In some cases such foci are of tuber- culous origin, as proved by their containing tubercle bacilli, but in others no bacilli can be detected. In this case they are probably due to antecedent broncho-pneumonia, though the child may die from generalised miliary tuber- culosis, the result of subsequent infection with tubercle. Prognosis.—The enormous influence exerted by age on the chance of a fatal issue is well shown by the following table, which shows the case mortality amongst 3181 cases of measles treated in Glasgow Fever Hospital during the years 1897-99. any of the more important complications super- vene, particularly membranous laryngitis, capil- lary bronchitis, broncho-pneumonia, and noma, the outlook is very serious. Diagnosis.—Should there be no eruption, as is sometimes the case, measles is very likely to be mistaken for an ordinary catarrh. Usually, however, the pyrexia is more pronounced; and there is often some degree of blotchiness of the face, which is very suggestive of measles. In such cases the presence on the buccal mucous membrane of Koplik's spots (see p. 224) must be carefully sought for, as their diagnostic value, if found, would be considerable. In some doubt- fvil instances, however, the presence of measles may be suspected by its connection with an undoubted attack. In cases attended with pro- nounced laryngeal catarrh, croup may be an early symptom, and the case simulate laryngeal diphtheria. The absence of faucial exudation alone is not Males. Females. Totals.

After two years the mortality rapidly fell. During the first quinquennium of life it was about five times as high as in the two suc- ceeding ones, and at ages subsequent to fifteen years all recovered. The influence of sex is practically nil. Measles is apt to take a severe form in strumous, rachitic, or tuberculous children, and in those subject to chronic lung disease, or recently convalescent from whooping- cough, diphtheria, or scarlet fever. Certain symptoms, moreover, point to an un- favourable prognosis, viz., early high temperature without remission, early rapidity of breathing, cyanosis, rapid and feeble pulse, dry brown tongue, petechial rash, haemorrhages, severe diarrhoea, tremor, and convulsions ; while, should conclusive, but a bacteriological examination of the laryngeal mucus should serve to exclude diphtheria. Three only of eruptive fevers are liable to be confused with measles, viz., rbtheln, scarlet fever, and early smallpox. The following characters should serve to dis- tinguish rCtheln :—The absence of pre-emptive illness (except that some adults complain of tender swelling of the posterior cervical glands for a few days before the rash comes out, oc- casionally with slight pyrexia) ; the mildness of the catarrh, which is usually limited to slight faucial redness and faint conjunctival injection ; the absence of Koplik's spots ; the occasional presence of an enlargement of the posterior cervical and mastoid lymphatic glands, consider- ably more pronounced than in measles, and at- tended with definite tenderness. The eruption is usually the first symptom of the complaint, and its component spots are commonly smaller,

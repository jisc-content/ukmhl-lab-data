The last, if elevated, may combine heavy rainfalls with a very low degree of humidity, and there are regions, as parts of Sind, practically rainless, where the air is never far removed from saturation, though such are not found in European countries. Hygrometry The only hygrometer in common use is the combination of wet and dry bulb thermometers, the latter giving the actual temperature of the air, and the former that of evaporation, the dew-point being calculated from the difference between their respective readings by means of a series of empirical factors worked out by Mr. Glaisher. The instrument is placed in the shade, four feet above the ground, freely exposed to the wind, but protected from the radiant heat of walls, etc. The wet blub is covered with muslin kept moist by twisting round it a skein of cotton, previously boiled in a solution of carbonate of soda, and afterwards in ether, to remove all traces of fat, the other end of the cotton being immersed in a vessel of water. The cotton should be changed every fortnight, and the water should be rain or distilled. When the water freezes and the siphon action is arrested the muslin should be moistened with a sponge or brush, and allowed to freeze again before the observation is made; but should the temperature have meanwhile risen above the freezing-point, the muslin, etc. should be thawed with warm water, and the reading delayed until it has cooled down to the true temperature. When the air is saturated the ' readings of the two thermometers will be the same, and indicate the dew-point, otherwise that of the wet bulb will always be the lower, though above the dew-point so long as the air temperature is above freezing. When this is lower, and the wet bulb is, as it should be, encased in ice, it will read 32° F. however low the dry one may have sunk. Use of Glaisher's Tables Multiply the difference between the readings of the two thermometers by the factor (Table B) opposite that of the dry bulb, and deduct the product from the latter; the remainder will give the dew-point. Then finding (Table A) the weight of vapour corresponding to the dew- point, and therefore actually present, and that which at the actual temperature would consti- tute saturation, the proportion that the former bears to the latter will be the degree of humidity for the time being. Thus, e.g., the dry bulb reading 67° F. and the wet 62° F. gives the difference of 5° F. The factor in Table B opposite 67° F. is 1-8, which x5 = 9, and 67°-9° = 58° F. = the dew-point.

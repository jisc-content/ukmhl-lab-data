MEDICINE; MEDICAL PRACTITIONER, LAW AS TO 287 physick, including surgery, anywhere within the realm. The charter and Act of 1522 were recognised and confirmed in 1553, and the privileges of the College enlarged (1 M. Sess. 2, c. 9). Their charter and privileges were again recognised by statute in 1858, 1859, 1860, and 1886. The material portions of these Acts are discussed in subsequent parts of this article. Surgeons.—Surgery was originally practised by barbers. In the city of London, the barbers obtained a charter of incorporation from King Edward IV. in the year 1461. Many other skilled surgeons were, however, in practice, and in the year 1540 they and the barbers were in- corporated, and were given the exclusive right to practise surgery within the city of London and its suburbs (32 Hen. VIII. c. 42). Under the title of " the mystery and commonalty of barbers and surgeons of London," the physicians and barber surgeons seem to have attempted to monopolise all treatment of disease to their own profit, for in the year 1452 (34 & 35 Hen. VIII. c. 9) an Act was passed declaring that it shall be lawful for any subject of the king " having knowledge and experience of the nature of herbs, roots, and waters, or the operation of the same, to practise, use, and minister in and to any outward disorder, any herbs, ointments, bettes, pultess, and cornplaisters, according to their cunning, or drinks for the stone, strangury, or agues, without suit, vexation, trouble, penalty, or loss of their goods." The company obtained a further charter in the year 1629 (5 Car. I.), giving it the right to examine and approve all persons who wished to practise surgery in London and Westminster, and empowering persons so approved to practise anywhere in England. In the year 1745, by statute 18 Geo. II. c. 15, the barbers and surgeons were separated into two companies. All the above liberties and privileges were transferred to the new Company of the Art and Science of Surgeons of London, who were empowered to make bylaws, etc., for their own regulation, ordinance, and government and to examine candidates and authorise those who passed successfully to practise the art and science of surgery through- out his Majesty's dominions. It has been suggested that the above Acts, or, at any rate, the older ones, are obsolete. The Court of Appeal, however, in 1885, did not adopt the suggestion, though it did not expressly overrule it {Davies v. MaTc%ma, 1885, 29 Ch. D. 596). There have since that time been several general Statute Law Revision Acts; but the above Acts, though amended in some minor points, remain on the list of statutes in force in the United Kingdom. Apothecaries.—In the year 1618 King James the First granted a charter of incorporation to the apothecaries of London, by virtue of which they practised their art and mysteries and en- joyed special rights and privileges for a period of two centuries. The charter was superseded in the year 1815 by the Apothecaries Act (55 Geo. III. c. 194). By it the Master Wardens and Society of Apothecaries were empowered to regulate the conduct of members of their craft throughout England and Wales. No person, not already in practice, might for the future practise as an apothecary, or apothecary's assist- ant, without passing an examination as to his fitness, and obtaining a certificate of his quali- fication (ss. 14-17). Any person who should thereafter act or practise as an apothecary without having obtained such certificate was declared guilty of an off"ence, and liable to a penalty (s. 20); and it was further provided that no apothecary shall be allowed to recover any charges in a Court of law, unless he should prove at the trial that he had obtained the certificate (s. 21). The Act gives no definition of what constitutes practising as an apothecary, beyond reciting (s. 5) that "it is the duty of every person using or exercising the art and mystery of an apothecary to prepare . . . and dispense such medicines as may be directed by a physician." Making up medicines prescribed by a physician, or by any other person, including the apothecary himself, would therefore come within the Act, but surgical attendance would not {Woodivard v. Bell, 1834, 6 Car. & P. 577). " Dispensing, mixing medicine, giving medical advice, and attending the sick as medical adviser must be considered as acting as an apothecary " (per Cotton, L.J., in Davies v. Makuna, 1885, 29 Ch. D. 606). Carrying on business by means of qualified assistants seems not to be prohibited {ibid.; see also Pharmaceutical Society v. London and Provincial Supply Association, 1880, 5 App. Cas. 857). But a qualified man cannot legally recover charges for medical aid and advice rendered by an unqualified assistant, unless under his own express direction and supervision (Howarth v. Brearley, 1887, 19 Q. B. D. 303). Apothecaries are distinct from chemists in that they may apply and administer medicines, while chemists may only prepare, dispense, and sell them {Apothecaries Co. v. Greeno%iCjh, 1841, 1 Q. B. 800). Pharmaceutical chemists are not considered to be medical practitioners, but are subject to the special regulations of the Phar- macy Acts (see " Chemist"). If a chemist pre- scribes medicine to his customers, as well as makes it up and sells it, he renders himself liable to the penalty under the Pharmacy Act {Apothecaries Co. v. Nottingham, 1876, 34 L. T. 76). Medical Acts.—The union of the different branches of the medical profession under one governing body was effected in the year 1858 by the Medical Act 21 & 22 Vict. c. 90. The original Act was amended in 1859 (22 Vict. c. 21), 1860 (23 & 24 Vict. c. 7), 1876 (39 & 40 Vict. c. 40, and c. 41), and in 1886 (49 & 50 Vict. c. 48). These Acts are to be read together,

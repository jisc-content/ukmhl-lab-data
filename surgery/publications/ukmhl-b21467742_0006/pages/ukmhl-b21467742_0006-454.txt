432 MINERAL WATERS Kionka increased the excretion of uric acid in birds 40 to 50 per cent by giving small doses of powdered egg-shells (calcinm bicarbonate), and Von Noorden has given this remedy with success in chronic gout. As many of the in- different thermal waters contain lime salts, Kionka's results may have some bearing upon their value as a di'inking cure. Certainly the very definite therapeutic effects of such waters as those of Bath, Buxton, Wildbad, Gastein, Schlangenbad, Ragatz, and other similar spas, in gout and rheumatism cannot be put down to the effects of simple hot water alone. Indications.—Gout, rheumatism, rheumatoid arthritis, sciatica, lumbago, diseases of nerv- ous system (early stages), neuritis, neuralgia, neurasthenia, after effects of injuries to and thickening of joints, intestinal troubles, gastric and uterine affections, pelvic exudations.

Miiriated Saline Waters.—Common salt is the main ingredient in these waters. Taken internally it stimulates the secreting power of the stomach and intestines, hastens tissue change, and increases circulation, especially through the portal system. Combination with carbonic acid gas much increases its action both on the stomach and intestines. The saline baths undoubtedly stimulate the peripheral nerve - endings and the capillary vessels, and have a distinct effect upon various internal organs, especially the heart, through the central nervous system, which action is much enhanced by the presence of carbonic acid gas. Muriated Salines with Bromine and Iodine.—■ This combination, present in the waters of Wood- hall in England, and Kreuznach in Germany, is much used in uterine troubles, fibroids, and the various pelvic exudations. Baths and vaginal injections are used, and the water is also drank. Indications.—Chronic rheumatism, gout and arthritis, scroftilous complaints, anaemia, gastric and hepatic congestion, uterine troubles and pelvic exudations, uterine fibroids, obesity. Nauheim has a special reputation in cases of cardiac disease. The forms of heart affection in which this treatment is indicated are cardiac dilatation, mitral disease with failing compensa- tion, the alcoholic and post - influenzal heart,, some cardiac neuroses and other functional affections, and early cases of fatty heart. In conjunction with the baths resisted exer- cises are given. Llangammarch water contains barium in medicinal quantities, and is also useful in cardiac cases. III. All-aliiie Waters—• (a) Simple alkaline. (b) Muriated alkaline. The main constituents of these waters are carbonate of soda and carbonic acid gas in class (a)—with the addition of chloride of sodium in class {h). Oxidation and tissue change are greatly influenced; the secretion of bile and saliva is increased; and the waters act as diuretics, antacids, and general solvents. Chief Simple Alkaline Waters Name.

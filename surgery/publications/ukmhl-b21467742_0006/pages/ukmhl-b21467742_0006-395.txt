METEOROLOGY 373 early in the morning when the maximum is assumed to have been reached during the after- noon of the previous day. But it would be better that they should be read twice daily, since in winter, when the sun's heat is feeble, the maximum may be reached in the morning and the minimum in the afternoon, instead of the night, being determined rather by the winds and clouds than by the hour of day. In a few State-supported observatories con- tinuous graphic representations of the fluctua- tions of temperature are taken by means of photographic or other self-recording apparatus, but it is very difficult, if not impossible, to in- tegrate curves of such extreme complexity, and those obtained from 24-hourly observations are accurate enough for all practical purposes. From these it will be seen that in summer the highest mean daily temperature is found about 2 P.M., when the earth is still receiving heat faster than it is parting with it, and the coldest about an hour or two before sunrise, when the earth has been longest deprived of the solar rays ; for the same reason that July and January, not June and December, are the hottest and coldest months. But hourly observations cannot be made by private persons, and a fair estimate of the ther- mal character of a place or period may be drawn from the maximum and minimum as recorded irrespective of the hour by self-registering ther- mometers, and of the mean temperature by three daily observations at certain hours cor- rected by factors or coefficients. Sir J. Herschell gave the following formulae for observations: t, t', and i", taken at 7 a.m., 2 p.m., and 9 p.m. ; or at 8, 3, and 10 - 4 - ' ' 24 Mr. Scott prefers the Greenwich hours of 6, 2, and 10, corrected by empirically determined coefficients for each month in the year, while Mr. Marriott has done the same for the maxima and minima. Humidity Humidity is absolute or relative, the former term expressing the actual weight of aqueous vapour present in a given volume of air, and the latter the proportion that it bears to the possible maximum at the temperature for the time being, and is stated in degrees, that is, in percentages of the maximiim or saturation. Thus 4 grains of vapour in the cubic foot represent saturation, or 100 per cent at 50° F., but only 66 per cent at 62' F., and 50 per cent at 70° F. If the temperature sank rapidly to 42° F., at which 3 grains constitute saturation, 1 grain would be deposited as dew. The point at which the deposition begins, in this case 49° F., is called the dew-point. In other words the dew-point is the temperature at which the amount of vapour actually present would suffice for saturation, so that given the temperature at the time and the dew-point, the actual weight of vapour present, as well as the relative humidity, can be calculated. The following table gives the weight (in grains) of vapour in a cubic foot of saturated air at various temperatures from 14' to 88° F. From this it will he seen that at 80° F. the air is saturated by 11 grains, at 60° F. by 6 grains, and at 40° F. by 3 grains; and it is clear that if the humidity be 75 per cent at 60° F., dew will fall when the temperature sinks to 53° F., but if the humidity at 60° be only 50 per cent, dew cannot fall until a temperature of 41° is reached. With a day temperature of 60° and 75 per cent of humidity, the lightest frost will cause a heavy deposit of hoar frost; while with a temperature of 40° and humidity of 50 per cent, none will fall unless the night temperature sink to 24°. Hence the greater damage to orchards in clear nights following warm days in spring than when the weather is dull and cold.

Evaporation depends indirectly only on temperature, but directly on humidity, being most active when the air is 7-elatively driest. It is not arrested even by freezing taking place from the surface of ice no less than of water, if the air be, as it often is during prolonged frosts, relatively dry, while in warm rainy weather it may be very small, and it ceases entirely when saturation is reached. Humidity and evaporation are among the most important factors in the influence of climate and weather on health, and it is well to bear in mind that there is no necessary relation between the rainfall and the humidity of a place, When the air is thus saturated, the readings of the wet and dry bulb thermometers are the same ; humidity- less than 100 per cent is indicated by the lower reading of the wet bulb.

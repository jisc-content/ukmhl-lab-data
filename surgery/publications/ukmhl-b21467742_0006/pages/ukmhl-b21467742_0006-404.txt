METEOROLOGY 382 determine the nature of the changes in the blood induced by the long-continued respiration of such rarefied air have been subjected to severe criticism, there can be no reasonable doubt as to the increase in the number of erythrocytes, the amount of hsemogiobin, and the capacity for absorbing oxygen, together with the greater depth and volume of the respirations; while stimulation of the evaporation from the body and the metabolic processes aid the general nutrition, and the influence of the solar rays in a clear diathermic atmosphere cannot but be highly beneficial. The effect of dampness of soil on the preva- lence of phthisis, though indisputable, is but indirect; combined with humidity and fog, with cold winds and chill, it is apt to induce catarrhal states of the respiratory mucous membrane, rendering it more vulnerable to the attacks of the tubercle bacillus, especially if the domestic and other conditions of life be more or less insanitary ; but simple exposure to cold, and even to wet, as in a life passed in the open air, tends to harden the system against such accidents, as is seen in the extraordinary ex- emption from phthisis and the diseases of the respiratory organs enjoyed by fishermen, and in a less degree by agriculturists, and in the results of the outdoor treatment of persons already phthisical. Cold and damp localities are, however, con- ducive to rheumatic affections, though acute rheumatism, or rheumatic fever, really a different disease, seems to be more prevalent in places exposed to cold dry winds, probably from the liability to sudden arrest of the per- spiration incident thereto. So long as the normal temperature of the blood is maintained by unchecked perspiration, and the tension of the vascular system by imbibition of water, the most intense heat in a dry atmosphere can be borne without ill effects, as in Colorado, but the failure to maintain either of these conditions is speedily followed by one or other form of heat-stroke. Malarial diseases, so-called, can no longer be ascribed to meteorological conditions, since it has been proved experimentally that, so long as the body is protected against the attacks of the anopheles, men may reside with impunity in the most "pestilential" districts, even sleeping on the ground exposed to the night air, while the disease may be induced artificially in the healthiest localities by the bites of infected insects. The seasonal prevalence of diseases of the respiratory organs is cleai-ly attributable to the weather conditions of cold and damp, or the chilling effects of cold dry winds on the skin and bronchial mucous membranes. The annual recurrence of diarrliceal affections, especially among infants, in the third quarter of the yeai', so soon as the ground temperature at a depth of two feet or thereabouts reaches and continues at or over 60Â° F., is easily explained by the resuscitation to activity of certain pathogenic saprophytes to which these diseases are due, and to the changes effected by their means in milk and other foods. But the annual curves exhibited by other specific infectious diseases present problems of greater complexity. For the purpose of investigation of their etiology we must distinguish between those that, though propagated by direct personal infection, are originally referable to the attacks of bacteria having an independent and extra-corporeal ex- istence in the outer world, that is, in the soil or the water, and those that are purely parasitic, the bacteria being unable to maintain a n active existence, and to perpetuate their kind out of the human body. These questions, together with those involved in the cyclical recurrence of waves of greater or lesser epidemicity, have been already discussed in the article on " Epidemio- logy " (vol. iii.), and we shall restrict ourselves to a few remarks on meteorological aspects of the seasonal prevalence or annual curves pre- sented by these two groups. Typical examples of the former are enteric fever, and diphtheria among endemic diseases, and cholera which, endemic in a comparatively narrow area of the surface of the globe, occurs as an epidemic only in other regions either annually, or at longer or at indefinite intervals ; and of the latter measles, scarlatina, and smallpox, though the occurrence and recurrence of this last is greatly controlled and interfered with by the more or less general practice of vaccination. The meteorological conditions of the former are twofold: (1) those affecting the extra - corporeal existence and activity of the microbe itself ; and (2) those that influence the susceptibility of the human being; whereas with the latter the influence of meteorological conditions can be exerted in- directly only, that is, by rendering the individual more vulnerable or less resistant to infection. Those acting on the bacteria are the optimum temperature and humidity of the soil for each kind, whereas with those rendering the indi- vidual more susceptible, we have to consider the personal equation. The concurrence of the two is necessary in the former case. Thus in India, where the temperature is always sufficiently high, cholera waits for the recurrence of the rains to provide the other condition, and as the seasons are reversed in Lower Bengal and in Southern India the annual recurrences of cholera are so too ; whereas in Europe it is the higher temperature of late summer and autumn that is necessary for the development of an epidemic when the germ has been introduced. Enteric fever finds the requisite conditions in autumn only, and the curve rises with the utmost regu- larity in August, to decline in December with the approach of winter. The conditions of diphtheria are somewhat complicated by the

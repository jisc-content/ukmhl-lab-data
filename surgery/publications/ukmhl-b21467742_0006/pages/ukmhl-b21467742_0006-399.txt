METEOROLOGY 377 to vanish before the warmth of the sun. Another cloud, of no great altitude and mostly seen in fine weather, is the cumulus, resulting from the rapid condensation of moist air on rising to cooler strata of the atmosphere. It is massive, opaque, and with sharply - defined outlines, rounded above or resembling a range of mountain-peaks, white, and popularly compared to wool-packs when the sun shines on it, but when it conceals the sun it is dark often with gold or silver margins. Its base is almost always flat or horizontal, marking a stratum of warmer air that takes up the condensed vapour. Cumulo-stratus is a common form of cloud, often covering great part of the sky. It is a mixture of the three primary forms, and marks a transition to the nimbus or rain cloud; the flat base and alternate strata of darker and lighter hue indicate alternations of warmer and colder air. It soon passes into the cirro- cumulo-stratus, in which all three primary forms are blended, and is pre-eminently the cloud of rain and storm. When approaching from the horizon the upper border may be sharply out- lined, while rain is seen falling from the under; but when overhead, all definition and distinctions are lost in the rain, into which the under-surface passes. Rain and Snow Rain is the result of the sudden condensation of vapour, or, more correctly, of finely divided particles of water, contained in masses of the most certain in its result, provided orAy the essential condition of such a warm humid atmosphere, as is rarely met with in this climate, be present. It is, however, in constant operation in the Tropics, where it is the chief, often the sole cause of the copious rainfall in insular and low-lying regions. The second is that by which most of the rain in the temperate zones is produced. In Europe and America alike the heaviest rainfall is found on the western coasts, fanned by the moist and warm south-western gales from over the oceans; and since these shores are in Great Britain, Scandinavia, and North America the more mountainous, the warm vapour-laden air is forced upwards, when the first of these causes, the cold of the higher zones of the atmosphere, is superadded to the second, which alone would scarcely suffice to produce the heavy downpours so frequently observed in such districts, while the latent heat set free in the condensation of the vapour tends to maintain the mildness of the winter, as the amount of evaporation does to moderate the heat of summer. The third class is, as Dr. Hann has demonstrated, far less efficient than was formerly imagined.^ The average rainfall in England and Wales is 33-76 inches, in Scotland 46-56, and in Ireland 38-54. But while in the eastern counties of England it is only 25 inches, in the hilly or mountainous aud moorland districts of Devon, Cornwall, Wales, the Pennine range, and Cumberland, it varies from 40 to 80 inches.

There are three ways in which this may occur: (1) the ascent of a current of damp air into the higher regions of the atmosphere, (2) the contact of warm damp air with the colder earth of hills and mountain ranges, and (3) the mixture of masses of hot and cold air. The first is perhaps ' He calculated that tlie admixture of equal volumes of saturated air at 77° F. and 32° F., containing re- spectively 10 0 and 2*1 grams of vapour in the cubic foot, would give a mean temperature of 58-7° F., not 54-5°, owing to the liberation of 0-093 units of heat in the condensation of 1-5 grams of vapour in the cubic foot, of which 0-9 grams would be taken up again, leaving only 0-6 grams to be thrown down, as a rainfall from a column 1000 feet high of not more than 0 048 inch; and such a difference as 77° F. and 32° F. is itself in the highest degree improbable.

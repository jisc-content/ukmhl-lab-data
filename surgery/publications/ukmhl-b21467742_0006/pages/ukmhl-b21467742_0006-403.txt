Wind roses are perhaps the best and simplest; the percentages of the observed direc- tions being indicated by the relative length of the rays in a diagram of the compass, and the mean velocity or force (pressure) of each shown by a number at the extremity of the ray. The rays should be divided into ten equal segments by a series of concentric 5 per cent circles, leaving the intermediate units only to be deter- mined by measurement or by the eye. (See Fig. 5, p. 61.) Influence of Meteorological Conditions ON Health It was one of the many apophthegms of the great Max von Pettenkofer, at once wise and witty, that " we do not leave home for change of air, but for change of soil" and it is absolutely true. The air, as air, is in perpetual flux, but the climate, in the local and more limited mean- ing of the word, is determined by the soil even more than by elevation and aspect, which are second only to it in importance. On these with the character of the soil as regards its nature, permeability, retentiveriess of water, depth of subsoil, rise and fall of ground water, if present, or its absence, the surface contour, presence or absence of trees or herbage, its drainage and cultivation or waste character, and even on its colour, as affecting its absorption or reflection of light and heat, depend the amount of rain- fall, the dampness or dryness of the site, the humidity of the air, the tendency to fogs, and to some extent the temperature of the place. When, in fact, one hears that two places within a few miles of one another, or the two extremi- ties of some seaside health resort, have different "airs," it will always be found that it is the soils that differ, and that in this lies the ex- planation of the diiference in the local climates. A full examination of the influence of soil on climate belongs rather to physiography, and we must limit our observations to its immediate bearings on meteorological conditions. Gravels, sands, and chalk are among the most pervious to air and water; if deep, they will be dry and warm and free from fogs, except sea fogs, and such as, forming on hill-tops and cliff's, do not betoken dampness of site. But a, shallow surface soil of this kind resting on an im- pervious stratum will acciimulate a sheet of ground water, oscillating with the amount of rainfall for the time being, and sometimes rising almost to the surface. If by a river-side the ground water will closely follow its ebb and flood, and in a hollow the soil will be water logged. Capillary attraction and evaporation will keep such localities damp and foggy. Impervious and yet retentive soils, as stiff' clays and marls, do not admit of ground water,^ but are cold, damp, and foggy, the rain lying long on the surface as large puddles which evaporate slowly, or sinking a few inches into the cultivated or made soil on the surface. In towns, however, with the entire area well sewered and paved, clay soils m&j be fairly dry, and for low-lying river-side dwellings their impermeability is a distinct advantage. Im- pervious and non-retentive rocks are, of course, the driest of all. High Altitudes.—The factors that go to make up the characteristic climate of high altitudes are the low atmospheric pressure, the lesser amount of oxygen in a given volume of air, the lower temperature and greater dryness of the air, and the greater intensity of the solar rays. Though the experimental methods adopted to ' The so-called '' land springs" met with in heavy- clays are seams of gravel which, collecting storm waters along their line of outcross, act precisely as "agri- cultural drains," and are a serious annoyance when in- tersected by the cellars or basements of houses.

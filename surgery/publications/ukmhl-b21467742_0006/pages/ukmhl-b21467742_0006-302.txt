284 MEDICINE, HISTORY OF antitoxin. After numerous trials they found that the horse possessed this power of resisting the effect of enormous and repeated increasing- doses of the most virulent diphtheritic toxin from sterilised cultures, so that after a time the serum of its blood presented a concentrated solution of the antitoxin, the strength of which could be determined by its power of neutralising the effects of known quantities of the toxin on highly susceptible animals, as guinea-pigs, employed for the purpose. The success of this treatment has fulfilled the most sanguine ex- pectation, adequate doses of such antitoxin injected within the first two or three days of the disease, before the toxin has appreciably damaged the nervous and muscular tissues, arresting its progress and reducing the mortality from an average of 30 to 5 per cent or less, and a single injection protecting a healthy individual from infection for three or four weeks. Prophylactic or therapeutic sera, variously prepared by modifications of Behring's or Pasteur's methods, have been used with more or less apparent siiccess in other diseases, as Haffkin's, Yersin's, and especially Lustig's, against plague; but none of these, and still less those against cholera, enteric, and yellow fever, can as yet be said to have gone beyond the tentative and experimental stage. A pheno- menon first observed by Grube, but commonly known as Widal's test, the agglomeration of the bacilli of enteric fever in a fluid culture on the addition of a small quantity of the serum of a person suffering, or who has within a period of, say, ten or twelve years suffered from that disease, and doubtless due to the action of some antitoxin, and in the case of a previous attack connected with the acquired immunity, is, if the experiments be conducted with proper pre- cautions, absolutely diagnostic of the nature of the fever, and of the utmost value in doubtful cases. The same phenomenon has since been noticed in other diseases and applied to the identification of bacilli of doubtful nature. Tuberculin and mallein, prepared respectively from cultures of the bacilli of tuberculosis and of glanders by Koch, though they have failed to exert any influence on the course of these diseases, have proved of the utmost value in diagnosis; their injection, while producing no effect in a healthy animal, being followed by febrile disturbance, marked by a characteristic curve if the disease be present, even in its earliest stages, when as yet no physical signs can be detected. TuberciUin is now widely used in the elimination of tuberculous cows from the herds of dairy farms, and mallein for the ex- clusion of glanders from the establishments of cavalry regiments in Germany and Austria. The search for an antidote to the poison of the venomous snakes of India and other tropical countries seemed as hopeless as that for the " philosopher's stone"; but Sewall and Kan- thack having found that animals could be immunised by repeated injections of minute doses of the poison, Calmette continued the work with extraordinary care and patience until he rendered rabbits, the most susceptible of animals, immume against almost incredible quantities of the venom, and their serum a well- nigh infallible antidote to the poison, not only of the pai'ticular species of snake employed, but to those of all others, even when the man or animal bitten has been apparently moribund. Though the poison of serpents is a secretion of a gland, not the prodvict of bacteria, it is evident that its introduction into the body of an animal tends to the production of an anti- toxin in the same way as does that of the toxin of diphtheria, though under ordinary conditions in qviantities utterly insuihcient to neutralise its effects. A retrospect of the successive views as to the nature of tuberculosis that have prevailed during the past half century presents one of the most instructive studies in the history of modern medicine and of steps towards the attainment of the truth. The name of tubercle was given by Laennec to the nodular masses found in the lungs and other organs involved. To him the minute "miliary" or grey tubercles were the earliest manifestations, and the yellow masses the later developments. A subsequent generation of physicians discovered that the yellow or "caseous" masses were merely ac- cumulations of the degenerated products of in- flammatory and catarrhal processes which might or might not have a tuberculous character; and Virchow, finding that the miliary tubercles followed the course of the minute lymphatic vessels, and were, in fact, diseased lymph glands, described true tubercle as a new for- mation or neoplasm of the lymphatic type, analogous to those evolved from other tissues, as epitheliomata, sarcomata, etc., and which, like all such, was prone to degeneration and caseation. Villemin, Wilson Fox, and others demonstrated the infective character of tubercle, and of such caseous materials as were derived from or associated with it; and lastly, Koch, by the discovery of the tubercle bacillus, pure cultures of which, free from the smallest trace of cheesy or other matters, were, when inocu- lated into susceptible animals, followed almost invariably by the development of tuberculosis— first local and then general—established the bacterial character of the disease and its com- municability. Each conception of tubercle in the past contained an element of truth, but was not the whole truth, and Virchow's lymphomata were nothing more than the lymphatic vessels and glands enlarged by the irritation of the bacilli that permeated them and followed them in their course. The recognition of the bacillus as the essence of the disease brought together as local manifestations of tuberculosis a number

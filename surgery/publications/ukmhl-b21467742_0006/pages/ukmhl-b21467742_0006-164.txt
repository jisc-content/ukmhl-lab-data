MALARIA 146 The prophylaxis of malaria can be approached in the three following ways:— I. The definite host of the malarial parasite, namely, the Anoj^heles mosquito, can be de- stroyed either in its aquatic or aerial stages. II. Man can be protected from the bites of mosquitoes. III. The malarial parasite can be attacked in its human host. The two first methods are the most satis- factory, as they prevent an individual becoming infected. I. The Destruction of the Anopheles. — The main efforts should be directed against the destruction of the insect in its larval form, for it can be most easily dealt with in the aquatic stages of its existence. In towns, in nearly every case, the collections of water suitable for the breeding of Anopheles can be dealt with either by filling up pools or by converting sluggish streams into rapid streams, or by employing some larvicidal substance in the water. In course of time these duties will, doubtless, devolve on the local sanitary author- ities, but in the meantime medical men may be called upon to direct these operations. The filling up of the Anopheles' breeding haunts may, in some cases, consist merely in turning a few spadefuls of soil; in others it may neces- sitate the institution of extensive engineering works. Celli and Casagrandi have carried out a number of experiments with various sub- stances to ascertain the one which is most active as a larvicide (see tables A and B).

Their results are as tabulated; the ideal larvicide, however, has yet to be found. It should be cheap, difi^usible, non-volatile, and non - poisonous to man, to domestic animals, and to vegetation. Paraffin and tar are both efficient larvicides, but, on account of their volatile nature, require to be renewed at fre- quent intervals. These substances act by forming a thin layer on the surface of the water, and so preventing the access of air to the larvse and pupae. Celli has obtained good results from th use of the aniline colours (the best of which are larvicide), a proprietary pre- paration, green malachite, and gallol. These substances are readily diffusible and non-volatile. Celli found they destroyed larvae after two days. Milk of lime and sea water have also been found effectual. In some districts it may be possible to utilise some waste product or some metallic ore that is at hand. Experi- ments are wanted in this direction. The young larvae are most easily destroyed; the eggs, adult larvae, and pupae are more resistant to larvicidal substances. Pupae are, however, readily destroyed by any substance that prevents their access to oxygen.

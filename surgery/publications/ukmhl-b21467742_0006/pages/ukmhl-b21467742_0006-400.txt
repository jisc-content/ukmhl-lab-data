METEOROLOGY 378 in some localities exceeding 100. The like difference is observed between the eastern and western counties and shores of Scotland, and, though to a less extent, in Ireland. The heaviest rainfalls in England and Wales are in the Lake district, arovuid Snowdon, and over a small area in Carmarthen, and in Scotland in the Isle of Skye and on the opposite main- land from Ben Nevis to Loch Linnhe. The extremes for the whole island are 15 inches at Thetford in Suffolk, and 145 at Seathwaite in Cumberland. But there are marked differ- ences at the same places in different years: as at Plymouth, where the extremes hitherto recorded have been 45 and 100, and at Exeter 30 and 90; while, owing to local orographical conditions, there are spots in the areas of the heaviest rainfall where the mean rivals that of the lowest, e.g. at Sidmouth in Devonshire it is 32, and at Cockermouth in Cumberland only 22, though but a few miles distant from Seathwaite where the mean is 145 inches, and the highest in the United Kingdom. There is no relation between the rainfall and the humidity of the air, the latter depending on the nature of the soil, as may be seen in the preceding table, giving the temperatui'e, rainfall, number of rainy days, humidity, and nature of the soil at a number of English health resorts. The independence of rainfall and humidity is well illustrated by the contrast presented by Falmouth and Cromer, the rain- fall at the former being 60 per cent greater, but the humidity 5 per cent less than at the latter. These averages are taken from the records of the Meteorological Society from 1882 to 1888 inclusive, except for Brighton, where they have been contributed by a local observer during the years 1879 to 1892.

Within this is a glass cylinder, into which the tube of the funnel dips, provided with a lip for convenience in emptying it. To retain snow which might be blown out of the funnel a second cylinder of copper, 8 inches in diameter, and open at both ends, is mounted on the rim of the other, so as to form a wall several inches high around it. It should have a flange on its lower end to steady it. The water or the melted snow is, when collected, once a day or oftener in hot weather, measured in an accu- rately graduated glass, unless the receiver itself be graduated for the purpose. But the narrower the measuring glass the more accurate will be the estimation. Thus, if the diameter of the measure be 2^ inches its area will be 5 square inches or one-tenth that of the funnel, and each inch and tenth of an inch on it will represent a depth of 0-1 inch and 0-01 inch of rain. The gauge should be fixed at a height of 1 to 4 feet from the ground in an open situation, free from all eddies, with no building or other object sub- tending an angle of 20°. Theoretically the ele- vation should make no difference, but in practice it is found that a gauge placed on a terrace or a roof shows a less amount of rain owing to the up-current of air produced by the deflection of the wind impinging on the face of the wall. This is the explanation of the apparently lesser rainfall on roofs and terraces than on the ground below ; but when the difference of eleva- tion amounts to hundreds or thousands of feet the phenomenon is real, for cooler raindrops or snow, in passing through warmer, nearly satu- rated strata, or those in which the vapour is already condensed as cloud or fog, condense the gaseous and precipitate the condensed moisture, increasing rapidly in bulk as they fall. In London and the eastern counties a fall of 1 inch in the twenty-four hours is rarely ex- ceeded, though 3-12, 3-5, and 4-6 inches have been collected within a few hours on some oc- casions, and 4-3 and 5-3 in the western shores. The bulk of snow depends on the size and grouping of the crystals, but roughly a foot of snow corresponds to an inch of rain. Alleged falls of 4 or 6 feet are really the effects of drifting. The question of the origin and formation of hail, whether of the true and hard or the soft kind, is one that has never been satisfactorily solved.

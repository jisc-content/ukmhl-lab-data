379 METEOROLOGY it listeth," we are not yet in a position to determine, much less to predict, " whence it Cometh and whither it goeth," but we can watch, and to some extent anticipate its pro- gress. Winds are the effects of disturbances of equilibrium, constantly proceeding in the freely mobile atmosphere; the causes of these dis- turbances being unequal densities due to un- equal distribution of temperature and vapour, aided by physical and other factors, and are general or local in their action. Among the general are the permanently higher temperature of the equatorial zone and the cold of the polar regions, the annual alternation of summer and winter in the northern and southern hemi- spheres due to the obliquity of the earth's axis to the plane of its orbit, and consequently the greater or less angle of incidence of the sun's rays whereby one hemisphere is always warmer or colder than the other, and the diurnal cycle of day and night due to the rotation of the globe on its axis, exposing successive longi- tudinal segments of its surface from west to east to the influence of the solar rays, the effect of which in the diurnal range of temperature is more marked in that hemisphere which is for the time being the warmer; while among the local conditions are the distribution of land and water, with their imequal capacity for absorption and radiation of heat, and the evaporation from the ocean, tending by the addition of aqueous vapour to lower the density and pressure of the atmosphere; the influence of warm and cold ocean currents which, having a like origin with those of the atmosphere, are deflected in all directions by the shores of the continents, and a similar, though less absolute, obstacle presented to atmospheric currents by mountain ranges, which deflect them to some extent, but exert a more powerful action in cooling them and precipitating their moisture as they impinge on their summits. The velocity of the rotation of the globe being greatest at the equator and diminishing towards either pole, the upper and lower perpetual currents from the equator to the poles, and from the poles to the equator, are deflected towards the south-west or north-east as they pass from zones of greater velocity to those of lesser, or vice versa; but these, as well as the secondary and directly dependent phenomena of trade winds and monsoons, belong rather to the field of physical geography than to the apparently fortuitous and variable phenomena of weather and climate with which we are concerned, and in which local conditions play so important a part. In the rotation of the globe on its axis, the atmosphere, being less coherent than the earth, tends to lag behind ; consequently in the northern hemisphere winds blowing from the north deviate towards the west and assume a north-easterly direction, while southerly winds become south-west. In the southern hemisphere the resultant of these forces will obviously be the converse of this, and the direction of the wind round an area of low pressure, which in the northern hemisphere is the reverse of that of the hands of a watch, will in the southern be with them, and that round one of higher will be with the hands in the northern, and against them in the southern hemisphere ; the definition of cyclones and anticyclones commonly given and based on the order in the countries of Europe and North America, being reversed in this particular in those south of the equatorial zone. Hence Buys Ballot's law, which may be shortly stated thus :— "Stand with your back to the wind—then in the northern hemisphere the barometer will be lower on your left, and in the southern on your right." Which is as true of mean pressure and winds, as it is of the temporary phenomena of storms at sea for which the Dutch professor propounded it. The general complex of remoter consequences of the factors already enumerated is manifested in the vertical rotation of the atmosphere over limited areas, the vortices, or, more accurately, helices and antihelices travelling in these latitudes from west to east, with a tendency, for the reasons already given, to deviate in a north-easterly direction. They are of two kinds, known as cyclones and anticyclones, the baro- metric pressure in the cyclone being lowest in the centre and rising rapidly towards the cir- cumference. The area covered is relatively small; the movement of the air is centripetal and helicoidal, and from right to left, or, as it is generally expressed, in a direction opposite to that of the hands of a watch, its velocity being directly proportioned to the abruptness of the transition from low to high pressure, or, as it is called, borrowing a term from engineering, the steepness of the gradient. The pressure being lowest in the centre, cyclones are often spoken of as "depressions." In the anticyclone all these conditions are reversed; the atmospheric pressure is highest in the centre, the outward gradient gentle, the area covei-ed large, the movement of the air centrifugal, antihelicoidal, and from right to left, or in the same direction as the hands of a watch, while it is, owing to the lesser gradient, marked by a less velocity than that in the cyclone, which in the popular mind is generally associated with the notion of storms. When the " depression " or centre of a cyclone passes by to the north of any place the wind "veers," that is, changes as from S.E. through S.W.W., but if it pass by on the south the wind "backs," or changes in the opposite order. ■ The cyclone is characterised by high winds, rapid change, and more or less cloud and rain, lowering the temperature in summer, but raising it in winter. The anticyclone, on the other

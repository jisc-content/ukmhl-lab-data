HISTORY OF 281 MEDICINE, Bright in London immortalised his name by his epoch-making researches on the acute and chronic inflammation of the kidney, as Addison's has been associated with those of the adrenal glands. During this period the Germans, though patiently laying the foundations of the physi- ology of the future, did but little for the advancement of practical medicine. Vienna, however, produced two men whose names will never be forgotten, and who, as the teachers of the next generation of German physicians, pre- pared the way for the regeneration of medical science in the Empire : Skoda, who further im- proved the art of physical examination of the lungs and heart; and Rokitanski, whose gigantic labours in the entire field of pathological anatomy eclipsed those of all his predecessors and placed the science of pathology on a firm and permanent foundation. The second period was one of ceaseless activity in the fields of physiology and organic chemistry, the effect of which was to give an entirely new character to medical science. In both, the largest amount of work was done in Germany and France ; but as an Englishman had first demonstrated the circulation of the blood, so science owes to two other Englishmen, Marshall Hall and Sir Charles Bell, the dis- coveries of reflex action and the diff"erentiation of afferent and efferent or sensory and motor nerves, from which the whole of our knowledge of the functions of the nervous system and the causation of its diseases was subsequently de- rived. On the foundation thus laid others have built up by degrees the most marvellous achieve- ments of biology. It must suffice to mention Flourens, Broca, Brown-Sequard, Schroder, van der Kolk, and Du Bois Reymond among many who have investigated the function of the spinal cord; and Charcot, Erb, Eulenburg, Hitzig, Goltz, Ferrier, Horsley, and Gowers among those who have studied those of the several structures and component parts of the encephalon, espe- cially the localisation of the>olitional control of muscular action and of the functions of speech and language in particular cerebral convolutions. Claude Bernard and Pavy were among the earliest to investigate the functions of the liver, though their conclusions have been greatly modified of late, as have those of the past generation respecting the functions of the kidney, the more apparently obvious of which, as the production of urea and uric acid as well as the destruction of sugar in the blood, have been transferred to the liver and pancreas. Liebig's chemical theories of digestion were de- molished by Moleschott, and the subject placed on a true footing by Pennenkofer and his pupils; while, partly as the result of the triumphs of surgeons, the stomach has been shown to play a far less important part in the process than the small intestine and its glandular connections—in fact, to be far from an indis- pensable organ. The functions of the so-called ductless glands, the spleen, thyroid, and adrenals have been greatly elucidated by experimental and clinical research, and the study of the con- sequences of disease or injury of these oi'gans, especially of the thyroid, has led to the attain- ment of remarkable results in the treatment of disease by the administration of extracts con- taining the active principles of their secretions —that of the adrenals possessing properties of a remarkable and unexpected character and ex- treme energy. From the time of Skoda and Walsh, the diseases, structural and functional, of the heart and their physical diagnosis have engaged the attention of a host of workers, among whom Marey will ever be remembered as the inventor of the sphygmograph, by which alone could our knowledge of the influence on the circulation of variations in the elasticity of the arterial walls, of arterial and venous tension, of the conditions of nutrition and innervation of the heart itself and of those of its valves have reached their present completeness. As indirect consequences of these and of the re- searches of Haym, Ehrlich, Gravitz, v. Limbeck, Hoppe-Seyler, etc., into the relative numbers and different forms of blood-cells in health and disease have been the greater importance now attached to weakness of heart muscle than to valvular imperfections as such, and the utter discredit of transfusion of blood in any shape, in favour of intravenous or subcutaneous in- jections of a saline solution, capable of far wider application, and wholly free from danger. A. Kohler in 1877 boldly proclaimed that in death from haemorrhage under ordinary con- ditions the fatal termination was due not to the loss of the organic solids of the blood, but to the drain of fluid simply as fluid, the effect being purely mechanical or hydrostatical, since, as he plainly put it, " a pump when empty ceases to work." Sahli showed how the increased tension induced by the saline injection might be used to accelerate the elimination of poisons whether swallowed or produced in the organism, espe- cially if the injection were preceded by vene- section, thus explaining and to some extent justifying the copious "bloodings" of a past generation, since the thirst that followed de- manded the imbibition of large quantities of fluid, which restored the arterial tension in like manner as the injections, though less rapidly. Among all the activities of this age of pro- gress one name towers above the I'est, Rudolf Virchow, the record of whose work is the his- tory of modern scientific pathology. Born in Pomerania in 1821, he, after graduating at Berlin, was in 1849 appointed Professor at Wurzburg, where he had for one of his colleagues the great histologist, Kolliker. He here evolved his system of cellular pathology, which he gave to the world in his lectures at the Pathological

6 LUNACY quite equal to those at home. There is not in these countries, as might be guessed, the same hesitancy to accept State relief for lunacy, seeing the stigma of pauperism does not attach. There must always lurk in the minds of many who do not belong to the pauper class, and they are the great majority of the whole, a dislike to the source of relief and to the name. But it is consistent with observation and experience that this objection is gradually disappearing, and people have come to look upon relief more in the nature of a right. In New South Wales and New Zealand lunacy in ten years has expanded in excess of popula- tion by 16-6 and 18 per cent; in six years Victoria by 12'6, and Queensland by 9 percent. The increase in Canada between 1881 and 1891 sion. Ranking next is the emigration and migration from rural to urban areas and to other countries of the pick of the population constantly going on in response to the trend of modern life. The weaklings, physical and mental, remain behind. And in the third place, in the view of the writer is that of infant mortality and mortality up to five years, which is twice and thrice higher in urban and town areas than in village and rural ones. This is significant when such deaths account for from 30 to 40 per cent of the entire death-rate. By the operation of this agency many are removed who would as they grew up have passed into the ranks of lunacy. In the one case the weakly products of the birth-rate die from neglect, bad care, injudicious dieting, and Population. Countries. Census of Lunacy, 1891. Official Return, 1891.

The ratio per 1000 was 2-76 for 1891 ; but it has to be borne in mind that the statistics only refer to those treated in asylums, and that is mainly true of the statistics applicable to the Australasian colonies. Geographical Distribution.â€”Lunacy, at all events that produced by 90 per cent of the population, is like pauperism, inebriety, crime, disease, and mortality, very unequally distri- buted in the three kingdoms. There are good grounds for believing that this inequality is governed by two or three considerations, chief of which and exceeding all others is the economic one, implying a relative capacity to maintain in whole or in part the insane member of a family, and a resultant readiness to accept or demand public relief. This is always in evidence in poor areas, and in all areas in times of depres- exanthematous disease; while in the other they survive for opposite reasons, and swell the lunacy totals of rural, village, and insular areas. This is all the more remarkable seeing there is, looking to the main physical and moral causes working in society to bring about mental disturbance, every reason for expecting a larger production in centres. An analysis of the statistics of " chargeable" lunacy in England and Wales shows that with the exception of London county, with 21,338 insane, giving the exceptional ratio of 50 per 10,000, the pro- portion is lowest in counties with centres of industry, and highest in rural and more sparsely populated areas. Taking the mean of England on the basis of the 1891 census as 33 per 10,000, important counties such as Durham and Derby (20), York and Cumberland (24), Stafford and Northumberland (27), Chester, Glamorgan, and Lancashire (29), Northampton and Middle-

Though fog and mist, which differ only in the size of the coalescing drops of water, may, like dew, saturate the clothing of persons exposed to them, they are by no means necessarily indicative of damp- ness of site. No such suspicion attaches to those capping the summits of hills and elevated moorland of scantily covered rock, or veiling the cliffs and headlands of the western and southern coasts, nor to fogs to which the heights along the course of rivers are exposed, even more it may be than the low lands beneath ; but the case is totally different when they mark the sites of ponds and water-courses that have disappeared through drainage, or haunt low-lying lands where the ground- water is near the surface. Clouds consist of condensed vapour identical with fog or mist, but in the highest regions of the atmosphere they are often composed of prismatic crystals and spiculfe of ice. The lowest levels at which they float range from about 2500 feet in these islands to 10,000 feet in the Tropics. Howard's classification of clouds is adopted universally— A, Cirrus A + B, Cirro-stratus. B, Stratus A-f-C, Cirro-cumulus. C, Cumulus B + C, Cumulo-stratus. A -t- B -I- C, Curaulo-cirro-stratus or nimbus. Cirrus. — Feathery, streaky clouds at the very highest altitudes, probably com- posed of ice particles, moving slowly and usually in a direction opposite to that of the lower air. Generally a sign of wind and the forecast of a change of weather. Cirro-stratus, formed by the condensation of cirrus, appears as a network or as " ribs " stretching across from the horizon on one side to that on the other, but gradually coalescing as it sinks, it ultimately spreads over the whole sky of a uniform density. It indicates the approach of rain. Cirro-cumulus, also a high cloud, though at a somewhat lower level, is more flocculent and humpy, the rounded masses being often detached. It is popularly known as the "mackerel sky." Stratus is a cloud defined by Howard as "a widely - extended continuous horizontal sheet, increasing from below upwards." It is fairly uniform in thickness and hue. Howard called it "ground fog," which it is, lifted to a higher level. It is a fine-weather cloud, appearing in the evening and morning,

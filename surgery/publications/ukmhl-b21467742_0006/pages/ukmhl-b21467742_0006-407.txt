METRIC SYSTEM 385 the two systems, the metric and that in use in this country, I place the measures of length in two parallel columns. Metric System. 1 Myriametre^ 1 Kilometre = 1 Hectometre = 1 Dekametre 1 Metre = 1 Decimetre 1 Centimetre = 1 Millimetre = 1 Micron = : 10,000 Metres. 1,000 ,, 100 ,, 10 ,, 1 0-1 0-01 0-001 0-000001 English System. . fl League =3 Miles. 1 Mile =8 Furlongs. 1 Furlong = 40 Rods. 1 Rod =5^ Yards.

This may be exemplified by the statement that while a Kilometre (which is roughly fths of a mile) con- tains 10 Hectometres, 100 Dekametres, 1000 Metres, 10,000 Decimetres, and 100,000 Centi- metres, a statute English mile contains 8 Fur- longs, 320 Rods, 1760 Yards, 5280 Feet, 63,360 Inches, and 760,320 Lines, and the confusion is exaggerated if it be added that it contains 80 Chains and 880 Fathoms as well, and that the statute Mile differs from the Geographical or Nautical Mile. Further, to convert the metric measures into British measures or vice versa, is both difficult and time-wasting. The simplicity of the metric system is hibited not only in the measures of length also in those of surface, bulk, weight, capacity. Thus the unit for surface measure- ments is the square metre, subdivided into square centimetres, etc., and that for bulk is the cubic metre, subdivided into cubic centi- metres, etc. Mass or weight has for its imit the gramme (Gm.), which may be regarded as the weight of one cubic centimetre of distilled water at its maximum density, 4° C. From the gramme all the other measures of mass are derived; thus a Kilogramme (Kgm.) is 1000 grammes, the Hectogramme (Hgm.) is 100 grammes, the Dekagramme (Dgm.) is 10 grammes, the decigramme (dgm.) is one-tenth (0-1) of a gramme, the centigramme (cgm.) is one-hundredth (0-01) of a gramme, and the milligramme (mgm.) is one-thousandth of a gramme. Capacity has for its unit the litre (L.), which is the capacity at 0° C. corresponding to the volume at 4° C. of a Kilogramme of distilled water. From it the other measures are got by multiplying or subdividing by ten, VOL. VI ex- but and = 18 Inches. = 9 = 7-92 „ = 4 = 3 by a hundred, etc.; thus a Kilolitre (Kl.) is 1000 litres, a HectoHtre (HI.) is 100 litres, a Dekalitre (Dl.) is 10 litres, a decilitre (dl.) is one-tenth of a litre, a centilitre (cl.) is one-hundredth of a litre, a millilitre or a mil (ml.) is one-thousandth of a litre, and so on. The millilitre is practi- cally equivalent to the cubic centimetre. Although the conversion of into metric measures complicated if it is to be quite exact, there is a rough and ready method of accom- plishing it which may be kept in mind. Thus the metre is roughly 39^ inches, the centi- metre f ths of an inch, and the millimetre Tr^th of an inch, while the yard is less by about 3 inches than the metre and the inch corresponds to 2|- centimetres. The gramme is nearly 15^ grains, the Kilogramme corresponds to 2 lb. 3^ oz. (avoirdupois), and the milligramme to about Ty^th of a grain, while the pound avoirdupois is about 453| grammes and the ounce about 28^ grammes. The litre is about 35 fluid ounces (35-196 fl. oz.), and one millilitre or one mil or one cubic centimetre is equivalent to almost 17 (16-9) minims (Imperial); one pint is rather more than half a litre (568*336 c.c), a gallon is practically 4-|- litres (4-545), and a fluid ounce is 28^ c.c. (28-417). It is chiefly in connection with prescription writing that the metric system will come into the daily life of the physician, for most if not all Continental medical men use the metric system. It is important, therefore, to remember that the gramme (contracted form, gm.) corresponds to 15-432 grains (contracted form, gr.), that the litre (contracted form, L. or I.) contains 35-196 fluid ounces (contracted form, Jl. oz. or fl. s), that the millilitre or mil (con- tracted form, ml.) contains 17 (16-9) minims (contracted form, min. or m.). The decimil (dml.) or the tenth part of a mil, therefore, corresponds to 1-7 minims (approximately), and the centimil (cml.) to 0-17 minims (approximately). The decimil and centimil are specially useful in prescribing. See also Prescribing. Metritis.—Inflammation of the uterus ; various forms are enumerated, such as parenchy- matous, hsemorrhagic, and suppurative metritis. Metritis dissecans is the type in which the pus burrows between the layers of tissue which make up the wall of the organ and causes sloughing.

LUNACY 7 [— sex (30) fall considerably below it. On the other hand, Dorset, Devon, and Hants (36), Norfolk (37), Oxford (38), Wilts (40), Glouce- ster (41), Hereford (50), and Radnor (55) greatly exceed it. Lincoln, Essex, Sussex, Berks, Bedford, Bucks, Hertford, Monmouth, Salop, Notts, and Worcester approach it. In the twelve Welsh counties the mean is 30 per 10,000. In Scotland the same inequalities and even greater extremes are met with, and these can only be satisfactorily explained by considera- tions such as those referred to operating in a more marked degree. Thus, while the mean for Scotland is 32 per 10,000, six counties in the Highland and insular area have a ratio ranging from 43 to 59 per 10,000, the latter figure touched by the county of Argyllshire, being nearly double the mean of Scotland. Nay more, within the confines of this county and of the neighbouring counties of Ross and Inverness there are large areas with ratios of 61 and 77. Seven counties exceed the mean; six approxi- mate it, inclusive of the important ones of Lanark, Edinburgh, Stirling, Ayr, Fife, and Aberdeen—all, with the exception of the latter, being located in the great industrial belt of Scotland. Ten fall below the mean, the lowest being 22 per 10,000. In Ireland, owing to the imperfect and in- complete system of registration, one has to fall back upon the returns of last census to ascertain how the insane are distributed over the country. These may be considered reliable because they take cognisance of the thousands in official returns spoken of as " wandering at large "—a term which points to the workhouse or the home as the resting-place of such. So far as the four provinces are concerned, the following ratios apply—Ulster, 37 ; Connaught, 38 ; Leinster, 49 ; and Munster, 50. The mean for Ireland of all lunatics "under care " is 44 per 10,000, and it is said by the inspecting authority if the " wandering at large " were in- cluded, the ratio would be 55. No one for a moment believes that insanity in Ireland is nearly double that of England or Scotland. The economic factor explains much, and the low position of Ulster emphasises this fact. The highest ratios are to be found in the counties of Meath, Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford, and Clare ; and the lowest in Down, Antrim, Dublin, and Louth. Age, Sex, and Civil Condition. — From an analysis of the quinquennial (1894-98) admis- sion rate of 18,437 (m., 8967; f., 9470) to asylums, etc., males were to females as 100 : 105—^a sex ratio similar to that which obtains in the population as a whole. In the first two age periods of the whole population the sex ratios are equal; in the other six the female one preponderates by as much as 6 to 26 per 100, being in the last two 100 : 115 and 100 : 126. Among the insane for the quinquennial selected the sex ratios approximate at the 2nd, 3rd, 5th, and 7th; but in the other three, viz., the 4th, 6th, and 8th, females exceed males by numbers ranging from 9 to 12 per 100, being in the last 100 : 110, much less than that for the general population one of 100 : 126. It is evident that, in spite of a considerable excess of females at six age periods, including the three chief lunacy producing ones, viz., the 4th, 5th, and 6th, the somewhat higher ratio of females in the general population is not only not main- tained, but is reversed to such an extent as to betoken a much greater liability to mental break- down among the male sex. Among the insane of both sexes at the three chief insane produc- ing periods there has been a rise of 7*5 per cent compared with the previous quinquennial. In the two last periods the rise amounts to no less than 13"7 per cent and 17 per cent respectively. This is noteworthy. The increase at the 5th, 6th, 7 th, and 8th age periods greatly exceeds anything justified by the growth of population. It will be of interest to ascertain in which sex, at what age periods, and in what civil condition of life, those who make up the increase are chiefly to be found. But so far as the analysis submitted has gone, a large part of the inci-ease refers to senile subjects, and is such as clearly to indicate not only the sending to asylums and to private care of larger number of senile and incurable cases than formerly, and the con- sequent accumulation of such in institutions, etc., but also to suggest the earlier appearance of senility among the people than formerly. This latter proposition is difficult of proof, and as there are no available data to help in the matter, it is merely put forward as a suggestion to be considered with caution. In Scotland, from a comparison of the ages of the insane in and out of institutions in 1887 and 1897, there has been a great increase of both sexes, accentuated at certain ages. Under twenty the increase is 44 per cent, and above sixty-five, 30 per cent—males accounting for a rise of 20 per cent and females 36 per cent. The sex ratio for all insane in 1897 was 100 : 115, but above sixty-five it stood at 100 : 200. Between fifty and sixty-five years the increase of males has been no less than 39 per cent, of females 28 per cent, the sex ratio at these ages being in 1897, 100 : 140. Between thirty-five and fifty years males increased by 31 per cent, females 25 per cent, while the sex ratio in 1897 stood at 100 : 100; and between twenty and thirty-five years males 14'8 per cent, and females 22 per cent, while the sex ratio stood at 100 : 87. The features revealed by this analysis are, first, the vastly larger female ratio above fifty years, the equality from thirty-five to fifty years, and the smaller female ratio between thirty and thirty-five yeai's; and second, the great increase of 28 per cent of both

Diabetic patients may be maintained on a diet of milk alone and be capable of active exertion. In gastric ulcer milk is better borne than any other food (except Leube's dissolved meat), but in severe cases it is well to peptonise it, or to administer pepsin at the same time. Asses' milk is often pre- ferable to that of the cow. of the sugar is destroyed, a small amount of lactic acid being produced at the same time. Mare's milk, rich in sugar and poor in casein and fat, is the best, but cow's milk can be made available by appropriate manipulation. Koumiss of the highest quality, and, owing to the scien- tific skill and cleanliness practised, of greater constancy of composition and stability, is now thus prepared in Russia, Germany, and in this country by the Aylesbury Dairy Company, whose late chemist, Dr. Vieth, devoted con- siderable attention to the subject.

At first it was the practice to send patients to live in the tents of the nomads, but the dirt and discomforts of such a life being intolerable, several medical men opened well-conducted establishments at Ssamara, and later at Moscow and elsewhere, with far better results. Koumiss is a white, foamy, slightly sweet, acid and alcoholic refresh- ing drink, the alcohol increasing until the whole The fullest account, historical and descriptive, of the manufacture and composition of Russian koitmiss, its physiological action, therapeutic uses, and the earlier literature, is the appendix by Dr. Stange to Bauer's Dietetics, being vol. i. of Ziemssen's General Therapeutics, translated by the writer of this article for Smith and Elder in 1885. Koumiss varies greatly in the percentages of its constituents according to its age, mode of preparation, and the milk from which it is made. The following typical analyses, selected from a large number, show that that prepared from mare's milk is more alcoholic, and that the fermentation as brought about by the Bashkirs is more rapid and complete, the sugar disappear-

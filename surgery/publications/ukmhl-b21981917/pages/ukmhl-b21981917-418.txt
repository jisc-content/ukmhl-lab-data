Next dissect the integument from the deltoid region down toward the elbow, making it extra long and wide, and lifting every- thing down to the deep fascia. When the haemorrhage has ceased, dress the wound in the arm with sublimate gauze, apply the gutta-percha mold, fix it upon the cor- set with a tight roller, fasten it and the underlying hand to the skull-piece or helmet {a a, Fig. 445) and accessory, sup- porting strips of strong adhesive plaster, as at h. Lastly, stitch the edges of the flap to the freshened margins of the nasal rim. The circulation between the face and skin of the arm should be sufficiently established from the tenth to the four- teenth day to permit section of the flap. Since the skin of the arm is very thin, and after transplantation is apt to shrink away, it is a wise precaution to dissect up the flap from the shoulder and arm, making it longer than may at first appear necessary—and to do this eight or ten days before the arm is fastened in the immovable apparatus. The flap in this way shrinks, and is covered with granulations, in which condition union with the integument of the face is accelerated and assured. When the vascular connection is safely established, the pedicle is cut, the arm released, and the flap shaped and stitched in position, as in the preceding operation.

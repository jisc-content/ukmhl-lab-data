CARCINOMA. Malignancy in a tumor means its tendency to become multiple by metastasis; the tendency of the elements of which it is composed to travel along the lymph- or blood-channels, and, thus disseminated, to re- produce the parent tumor ; or its tendency to invade and destroy the tis- sues in its vicinity, and to recur in loco after extirpation. Strictly speaking, the tendency of a neoplasm to induce death has nothing to do with the question of its malignant character, for certain tumors, as tibro-myomata of the uterus and simple ovarian cysts, tend to produce death as well as carcinomata and sarcomata. The malignant neoplasms are grouped under two headings—carcino- ma and sarcoma. The non-malignant are as follows : lipoma., fibroma, myxoma.^ oste- oma, enchondroma, angioma, neuroma, myoma, adenoma, papilloma, and lymphoma. Carcinoma.—A cancer may be defined to be a tumor, composed of embryonic cell-elements of varying shape and proportions, collected in groups, which groups or clusters are partially separated by a well-defined stroma. While the elements of the carcinomata do not always differ so widely from those of the sarcomata (especially the more embryonic cells of this last neoplasm), the alveolar structure of the stroma of cancer will always render it easy of recognition.

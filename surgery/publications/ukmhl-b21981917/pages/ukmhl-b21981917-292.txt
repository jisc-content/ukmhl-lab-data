378 A TEXT-BOOK ON SURGERY. The great end to be achieved in the treatment of fractures is a re- duction of the displacement to as near the normal as possible, and the absolute retention of the parts as replaced. Reduction mar usually be Fig. 307.—Longitudinal section of a fractured femur, showing Fig. 308.—Permanent thickening from permanent occlusion of the medullary canal. The stalactite new-fomied bone in a fractured hu- exostosis is well shown in the right-hand figure. (From a merus. (From a specimen of the an- specimen of the author'.s.) thor's in the Wood Museum.) accomplished without an anaesthetic, but where the overlapping is con- siderable, and muscular contraction and rigidity marked, ether narcosis should be secured. The comparative safety of this anaesthetic justifies its general employment in fractures. A compound fracture demands, with fixation, free drainage. The fragments should be reduced, even when it is necessary to remove projecting ends with the forceps or saw to effect this. Once placed in position, they should be kept at rest, with openings and counter-openings. Special Fractures—Cranium.—The bones of the skull may be fract- ured by direct or indirect violence. Direct, when the bones give way immediately beneath the point which is struck ; indirect, as when, by falling from a height and striking on the feet or buttocks, the base of the skull is fractured by the force transmitted through the vertebral col- umn. A rarer form of indirect fracture of the skull is that known as fracture by contre-coup, in which the bones give way at a point opposite to that at which the injury is received. Fractures of the skull may occur with or without compression of the brain or meninges. The outer table may be depressed by crushing into the diploe without fracture of the inner or vitreous table, and, strange as

AMPUTATIONS. 115 Before the days of antisepsis the success of this method was thor- oughly demonstrated by Prof. James R. Wood and Prof. Dennis, in Bellevue Hospital, where the rate of mortality after amputations, in wards which had been recently vacated on account of puerperal fever, was reduced to the minimum in the history of that hospital. I have employed this method in a number of septic cases with great satisfaction. Fig. 164. In performing the amputation, the flaps must be so shaped that irriga- tion can be easily accomplished without moving the stump. A cii^cular cut, with a longitudinal incision on the upper surface, or bilateral flaps, are preferable. When the patient is put to bed the stump is placed in a position suitable for drainage, and rests upon an oil-cloth so arranged that the irrigating fluid runs away from the patient and into a basin at the bedside. The flaps should at first be held well open by a wad of sublimate gauze, and the stump loosely enveloped in a thin layer of this

PLASTIC SURGEKY OF THE NOSE. 405 Partial Rhinoplasty,— When there is only a par- tial loss of substance the operation is less difficult, and the prospect of success greater. When one ala is involved, as shown in one of my cases (Fig. 447), the flap may be made from the cheek (Fig. 448). In this patient I trimmed the cica- tricial edges of the scar and turned a flap, as indicated by the dotted lines, and stitched it to the nose. The v^ound in the face was par- tially closed by sutures. The pedicle was divided on the fourteenth day and turned back into the wound, the granulations having been previously scraped out. Or the flap may be borrowed from the side of the cheek, leaving the ped- icle above, as in Fig. 450. When the tip of the nose is eroded, the method indicated in Fig. 451 should be adopted. The broad end of the flap is split; the center strip {a) is for the septum, while those at hh are to complete the eroded al?e. Fig. 448.

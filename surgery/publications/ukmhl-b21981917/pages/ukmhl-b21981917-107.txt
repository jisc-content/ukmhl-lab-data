BURNS AND SCALDS. 93 to the umbilicus, and the strip of skin dissected up in the middle and left attached at both ends. When the small amount of bleeding Jiad been arrested, the hand was slid beneath this flap, the under surface of which was brought in contact with the raw surface, where the cica- tricial tissue was removed from the arm and held in Fig. 151.

Iodo- form - sublimate dressing was applied, and the hand and arm held immovable by adhesive plaster. Fig. 151 shows the condition of the hand, and Fig. 152 the method of transplantation. On the tenth day the strip of skin was divided above and below, and the ribbon folded around the wrist and stitched in position. The operation succeeded, and amputation was avoided. A second similar operation was done to restore the integrity of the palm. In all cases of transplanting skin no more of the sub- cutaneous tissue should be lifted with the integument than is necessary for the vitality of the flap. In short flaps a very thin dissection should be efi'ected; in longer pedicles a good deal of tissue should be left to insure the safety of the blood-vessels. Transplanting in mass, in which the piece of integument, at least one inch in surface-measurement, is entirely severed from its original attach- ment, and laid upon the granulating surface, is not so successful as the preceding methods. The smaller grafts are much preferable. When this operation is done, the piece to be transferred should be trimmed or scraped so thin that nothing but the epidermis and Malpighian layer remains. Destruction of tissue by acids or alkalies requires no especial consideration beyond the adoption of measures to neutralize the excess of the agent in the part involved. The after-treatment does not differ

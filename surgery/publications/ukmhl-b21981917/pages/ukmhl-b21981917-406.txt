The upper punctum should he dilated in the same manner as given for the lower, a probe-pointed knife or scissors introduced, and the canal slit well into the lachrymo-nasal sac. The bulb-pointed dilating-probes should now be carefully introduced, be- ginning with the smaller sizes (Fig. 428). As soon as the bulb enters Fig. 428.—Williams's set of lachrymal probes, a, b, Probes, c, Dilator, d, e, Styles. the sac it should be gently and slowly directed along the nasal duct until it is arrested by the floor of the nose. The larger sizes may be intro- duced as in the treatment of stricture of the urethra. After full dila- tation is secured the channel should be washed out daily, for about ten days, with a 1-per-cent boracic-acid solution. For this purpose Anel's syringe (Fig. 429) will be found useful. The probe-pointed nozzle Fio. 429.—Anel's silver eye-syringe, silver and gold points. is introduced into the sac and the water forced through until it flows freely into the nose. If the obstruction recurs, the i^robes should be re- introduced. The Orbital Camty.—Wounds, abscesses, and tumors of the orbital cavity demand no especial consideration. The same rules of practice prevail here as elsewhere. Benign neoplasms do not, as a rule, involve the eye in their removal. Malignant growths usually demand a thor- ough extirpation of all the contents of this cavity. Vascular tumors of the orbit, so-called infra-orbital aneurisms, not infrequently require deligation of the common carotid artery, and in some instances extir- pation of the mass from the orbital cavity. The indication for the first operation is marked arrest or diminution of the pulsation and size of the tumor after compression of the carotid in the neck. (See chapter on the Arteries.)

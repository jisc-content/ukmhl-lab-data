# HYPERTROPHY OF THE PROSTATE. 601 of the catheter in prostatic hypertrophy is such an important feature in the treatment of this disease, and at times is surrounded with such diffi- culties, that it becomes important in each case to study the condition of the neck of the bladder and urethra, to determine, with as much accu- racy as possible, the deviation of this channel from the normal. / ',1, ^ > Fio. 604- -The normal urethra of a male adult.

When hypertrophy of the prostate occurs, the distortion is practically an elon- gation and exaggeration of the natural curve from the triangular ligament back to the opening into the bladder (Figs. 606, 607). In the exploration an olive- pointed black French catheter, in size about No. 14 (U. S. scale), wiU be found to be a safe and satisfac- tory instrument. If warmed and oiled, it will usually pass to the neck of the bladder without resist- ance, and, in a majority of in- stances, the obstruction may be overcome by pushing steadily upon the catheter. No harm can arise from this procedure. If, however, the bladder is not entered, the in- strument should be withdrawn, armed with the wire stylet, bent to suit the curve of the deep urethra, and again introduced. A careful degree of force may now be employed to overcome the obstruction, Fig. 605.â€”The sound passing around the normal curve of the urethra. (After Van Buren and Keyes.)

Some operators prefer to use sublimate (1 to 3,000) rather than carbolic acid. When mercury is employed, great care should be observed in thoroughly evacu- ating the sac before applying the dressing, for fear of poisoning by ab- sorption. One operation is often sufficient to effect a cure by this method, and when carefully done to the exclusion of air, and with the thorough cleansing of the abscess, constitutional disturbance is rare. A second, and even a third, injection and irrigation may be tried. Should inflam- mation and sepsis follow, free incision should be practiced and thorough drainage established.

694 A TEXT-BOOK ON SURGERY. Lateral and Rotary-lateral Curvature of the Dorso-lumhar Spine.— Simple lateral curvature of the dorso-lnmbar spine is exceedingly rare. It is complicated in almost all cases by rotation of the vertebrse upon each other, and in deformity here from muscular causes, the rotation precedes the lateral curvature. Lateral curvature is usually caused by an inequality in the length of the lower extremities. Fig. 671 vs^as taken from a boy in whom the right extremity was one and a half inch shorter than the left. With both soles on the same plane, marked lateral curvature (convexity to the right) was observed. By placing the foot of the short side upon a book of the required thickness, the deformity disappeared (Fig. 672). Pig. 6Y0.—Lateral curvature after recov- Fig. 671.

A dif- ference of as much as one inch has been noted, while from one half to one fourth inch is quite common. Cicatricial contractions on one side of the chest or abdomen, as after extensive burns or in chronic pleuritic adhesions with collapse of the lung, also produce this deformity. The treatment will be considered with that of rotary-lateral curvature. ■ notary-lateral Curvature.—Rotation of the bodies of the vertebrae upon each other, and upon the sacrum and subsequent or simultaneous lateral curvature, is one of the most difficult deformities to correct. The chief cause is loss of the normal equilibrium of the muscles of the two sides of the trunk. The tendency to deformity is increased by the habit

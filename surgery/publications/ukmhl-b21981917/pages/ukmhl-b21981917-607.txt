593 STONE IN THE BLADDER—LITHOTOMY, accurately along the guide into the bladder, after which the conductor should be removed. Fig. 591.—Scoop and conductor. In removing a stone with the forceps two precautions are essential: 1, not to pick up the wall of the bladder with the calculus ; and, 2, not to employ force enough in grasping the stone to crush it. When the stone is grasped, if the instrument can be moved freely within the bladder, it is evident that this organ is not caught. With small calculi the extraction is easily accomplished. When the stone is large, a certain amount of force is justifiable and necessary to stretch the wound to its utmost; but this force should never be used unless the operator is satisfied that the stone and jaws of the forceps Fig. 592.—Gouley's litlioclast. can be brought through the wound without serious injury to the blad- der and prostate. If the stone can not be extracted whole, it should be crushed with the forceps or lithoclast (Fig. 592), and removed in frag- FiG. 593.—Lithotomy-scoop. ments. The larger pieces may be caught with the forceps, the smaller with the scoop (Fig. 593). A stream of water should also be forcibly Fig. 594.—Van Buren's debris-syringe. thrown in through the wound, in order to bring away any small parti- cles which may have escaped notice (Fig. 594).

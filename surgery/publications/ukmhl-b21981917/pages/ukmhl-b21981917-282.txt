A TEXT-BOOK ON SURGERY. 268 rounds the vessels and nerves of the space will be seen, and at the same time, and superficially, the popliteal nerve. Draw this and the vein which is immediately below outward, and the artery will be seen deeply situated, and in the upper part of the space internal to the vein. Lower down the relations change, the nerve crossing superficial to the vein, and this overlying the artery (Fig. 304). Ligation of the Posterior Tibial Artery at the Middle of the Leg.— Make an incision, half an inch from and parallel with the inner margin of the tibia, three inches and a half long. Avoid the internal saphenous vein. After passing the deep fascia, look for the lower tibial fibers of the soleus, which pass ob- liquely from this border of the tibia backward and slightly downward. Divide these on a director, and with the finger separate the sural from the flexor muscles. Retracting the edges of the wound, the artery will be seen, with a vein on either side and the posterior tibial nerve lying just behind. The vessels are held down by the common sheath of the deep muscles (Fig. 305). Opposite the Ankle-joint.— Half way from the tip of the internal malleolus to the ante- rior edge of the tendo Achillis commence an incision, which extends directly upward for one inch and a half. Dividing the skin and fascia uj)on a director, cut the dense internal annular ligament. The artery, with its two veins, will be found with the posterior tibial nerve and Fig. 305.—Ligation of the posterior tibial above the malleolus. tendon of the flexor longus pollicis behind, and the flexor longus digito- rum and tibialis posticus in front.

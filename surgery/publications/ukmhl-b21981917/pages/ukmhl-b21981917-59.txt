SURGICAL OPERATION'S. 45 This skeleton, or frame, is lashed securely to the table, and an oil-cloth laid over it (Fig. 101). If the head of the table is raised four or five inches on blocks, the patient rests in a kind of trough, along which the solutions are carried away from the parts of the body not to be irrigated. When such a table is not convenient, one may be extemporized from an ordinary dining- or side-table, or two of these placed endwise. All household furniture so used should be thoroughly washed and scrubbed, and then covered with clean sheets. The side-tables for dressings should Fig. 101. be also cleansed and covered with sheeting. It is always important to have plenty of room, so that the various articles and instruments may be arranged in the order in which they will be needed. A hard-wood cabinet (Fig. 102), about 3 by 2 feet (surface measurement), will serve an excellent purpose for holding trays of instruments, ligatures, etc., wdiile the drawr ers supplied with materials in reserve may prove convenient at any stage of the operation. The trays for holding instruments submerged in carbolic-acid solution should be made of j)orcelain or tin, not more than two inches deep, and of various lengths, to meet the requirements of the largest instruments.

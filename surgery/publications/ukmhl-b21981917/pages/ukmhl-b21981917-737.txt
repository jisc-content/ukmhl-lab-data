TALIPES. 723 there are atrophy and complete loss of power in the tibialis anticus, pero- neus tertius, extensor longus digitorum, and extensor pollicis muscles. Simple talipes equinus is not of very frequent occurrence, since it is almost always complicated with inward rotation of the tarsus, or talipes equino-varus. Treatment.—When complete paralysis has not occurred, and if taken early, talipes equinus, whether congenital or acquired, may be cured, or marked deformity prevented, by the institution of proper treatment. Section of the tendo Achillis is rarely necessary when the case has not been neglect- ed. The propriety of tenotomy can be determined by the degree of resistance met with in the effort to bring the sole of the foot to a right angle with the axis of the leg. If this can not be accomplished, or if, when the tars as is firmly flexed on the leg, pressure upon the sural muscles produces a painful and marked spasm (Sayre), tenotomy is indicated, especially in those patients who can not afford the long-continued expense of mechanical treatment, and who of neces- sity can not remain long in the hands of an experi- enced surgeon. In simple equinus the indications are to overcome the muscular contraction by artificial ap- pliances, and to restore the normal tonicity and power to the anterior tibial group of muscle. When a child is born with talipes equinus (and all forms of congenital club-foot should be treated from birth), deformity of the bones of the foot, and the too great stretching or elongation of the anterior muscles, may be prevented by the following simple means: Cut a piece of light board as wide as the sole, and a little longer than the foot, and cover it Fig. 709.—Bones of the toot of an adult with talipes equinus.

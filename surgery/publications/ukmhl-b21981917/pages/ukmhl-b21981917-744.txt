The adhe- sive strips and bandage have been omitted m the cut. An apparatus, the mech- anism of which is some- what similar to this, is high- ly recommended by Mr. Reeves, and is shown in Fig. 727. The modification of Scar- pa's shoe (Fig. 728) possess- es some advantages over the iron shoe above described, and should be preferred to it when it can be obtained. Tenotomy and fasciotomy will be found necessary in a large propor- tion of cases of talipes equino-varus, and, when not essential to ultimate success, it will greatly expedite the permanent restoration of the mem- ber to its normal position. The application of Esmarch's bandage from the toes to above the knee, though not essential, renders the operative procedure more rapid and easy of execution. The tendo Achillis is divided as heretofore directed. In addition, the tibialis anticus and the tibialis posticus will, as a rule, require to be divided. The tendon of the tibialis anticus should be cut subcutaneously about one inch above its insertion into the internal cuneiform bone by introducing the tenotome beneath it from the middle line of the foot. It can be made prominent by forcible eversion of the foot. Division of the tendon of the tibialis

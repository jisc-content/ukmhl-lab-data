From this point it describes a curve with an anterior convexity over the dorsum of the foot, following the line of the astragalo-scaphoid joint until the inner border of the foot is reached (Fig. 216), when it is carried back and ended at a point about one inch in front of the tip of the internal mal- leolus, which point is directly between the tuber- osity of the scaphoid and the tip of the mal- FiG. 216.—(Alter Le Fort.) Fig. 217.—(After Le Fort.) leolus. From the anterior limit of the straight incision below the ex- ternal malleolus describe a plantar tlap also with a forward convexity across the sole of the foot, as shown in Fig. 217. Dissect up the dor- sal flap, in order to expose the tibio-tarsal joint, taking great care in lifting the inner angle not to wound the tibial and plantar arteries. The disarticulation of Fig. 219.—(After Le Fort.i the astragalus from the calca- neum is next effected by intro- ducing a thin knife from the fibular side between these bones, and dividing the interosseous ligament. Then remove the front of the foot at the medio-tarsal joint, and complete the disarticulation of the astragalus, and with the saw remove the upper segment of the calcaneum on the level of its articular surface (Figs. 218, 219).

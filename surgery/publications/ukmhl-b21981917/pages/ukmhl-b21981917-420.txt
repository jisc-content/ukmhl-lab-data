Operations of minor im- ^,3=,,^^^,^=,,^,^^ portance are at times per- be corrected by exsecting a triangular piece from the septum and closing the gap with sutures. Congenital Lesions of the Nose.—Occasionally the lateral halves of the nose fail to unite, resulting in the deformity known as bifid nose. There may be partial or complete absence of this organ, or when present the nares may be occluded, or it may be complicated with the extreme cases of hare-lip. The operative procedure for the relief of this last deformity will be given in connection with congenital cleft of the lip. Occlusion of the nares may be relieved by cutting through the mem- brane in the direction of the normal opening. For the correction of forked-nose, or the absence of this organ, no fixed rule of practice can be laid down. Wounds.—Accidental wounds ot the lips are usually incised or lacer- ated. If badly torn, the ragged edges should be smoothly trimmed, washed with sublimate solution, and secured with interrupted silk •■ sutures. When the wound is through the entire thickness of the lip, the sutures should include the mucous membrane. A very fine suture or pin should be used in the vermilion border to insure absolute approxi- When the alse are too thick, elliptical pieces may be ex- cised and the edges closed, as in Figs. 452 and 453. If the tip of the nose is too pointed and upturned, it may in part Fig. 451.—(After Linhart.) The Lips and Cheeks.

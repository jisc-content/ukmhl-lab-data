311 FRACTURES. were written I think few surgeons would have the temerity to repeat the procedure. Introducing wires beneath the two fragments, from above downward, without cutting the integument, and securing approximation by twisting in front of the joint, is also unjustifiable. The use of Malgaigne's hooks is also unnecessary. The plaster-of-Paris method is employed by some operators ; but it is not to be preferred to the method of Hamilton. In this procedure the fragments are ap- proximated by adhesive strips. One piece is cut in the shape shown in Fig. 342, the broad part of which is applied just above the upper margin of the upper fragment, and fastened here by a roller. The entire limb is now covered by a bandage which leaves ex- posed the two narrow strips of the adhesive plaster. Over this the plaster bandages are applied, strong trac- tion being made uj^on the adhesive strips in order to hold the fragments approximated until the gypsum hardens. The limb should be enveloped from the ankle to the perinseum. In old fractures, with wide separation of the frag- ments and permanent loss of function of the extensor muscles, the best prothetic apparatus is a strong leath- er shield worn around the knee. This prevents too much flexion, and partly stiffens the joint. Many cases of wide separation, however, retain the function of the limb in a remarkable degree. In a case occurring in my practice, X/ ■■■ Fig. 342.—Gauntlet of adhesive plaster for exerting traction on the upper fracrment of a fractured pa- tella. Fig. 343.

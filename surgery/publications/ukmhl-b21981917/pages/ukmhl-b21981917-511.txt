497 FEMORAL HERNIA. acquired. The tumor enters the crural canal beneath Poupart's ligar ment, Just to the inner side of the iliac and femoral vein (Fig. 539). If it remains in the crural sheath, it is an incomplete, but if it protrudes at the saphenous opening, it is a complete femoral hernia (Fig. 540).

(Modified from Maolise.) Umbilical hernia is congenital or acquired. It exists not infre- quently at birth in both sexes, on account of the patulous condition of the omphalo-mesenteric duct. In this variety the only covering of the tumor is the sheath of the umbilical cord. In the acquired form the intestine escapes either directly through the navel, or more frequently to one side of this contraction. The sac of an acquired umbilical hernia is composed of the parietal layer, of the peritonjeum, and the outer cov- ering of integument. Ventral hernia may also be congenital or acquired. The protrusion may occur at birth, as a result of failure of development in the muscles of the abdomen. It is usually met with along the linea alba above the umbilicus. The acquired form may occur at any point, and results from accidental or surgical wounds of the muscles and fascia. It is quite frequently met with in the wounds of incision in the operation of lapar rotoniy. 32

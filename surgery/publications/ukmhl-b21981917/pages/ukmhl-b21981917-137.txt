AMPUTATIONS. 123 Second Method.—If the condition of the soft tissues is sncli that the long palmar flap can not be obtained, the circular incision shown in Figs. 181 and 182 may be practiced. It is always advisable to make a longitu- dinal split in the cuii along its ulnar aspect. Under other conditions, a Fig. 181. Fio- 184. lateral flap may be utilized, after the third method (Figs. 183, 184), in the flap from the thumb side ; or the fourth method in which the flap is taken from the ulnar aspect of the hand. Forearm above the Wrist.—In amputation through the forearm, the rule already given as general applies with equal force — namely, that that operation is best which least disturbs the nutrition of the flaps. For this reason, in all parts of the extremity, when the conditions of the tissues permit, the solid flap should be used. First Method.—At a distance beyond the point at which it is deter- mined to divide the two bones, sufl3.cient to provide an ample covering for the stump, with a scalpel or long knife, as may best suit the opera- tor's taste, make a circular incision through the skin, and just down to the deep fascia. When this incision is completed, and the skin retracted up- ward, at the level of the proximal edge of the wound, divide all the tissues squarely and smoothly down to the bones and interosseous membrane. Along the ulnar border, and immediately over the inner aspect of this bone, make an incision parallel with the axis of the ulna. This incision, which splits all the tissues down to the bone, will vary in length with the thickness of the member at the point of amputation. With the dry dis-

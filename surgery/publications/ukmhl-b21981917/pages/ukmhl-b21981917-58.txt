44 A TEXT-BOOK ON SURGERY. solutions, irrigators, etc. An adjustable stool (Fig. 99) for the surgeon should be among the accessories. An operating-table should be made of strong material, solidly put together, 6| feet long, 34 inches high, and 22 in width, padded with cotton, wool, hair, or felt, to the thickness of about one inch, and covered with some good water-proof material, drawn tightly and tacked to the edges, so that no folds or creases are left upon the sur- face. In modern practice, with the free use of irrigating solutions, it is necessary to arrange the operating-table so that the oil-cloth upon which Fig. 100. the patient is laid will convey the fluids in the required direction into a receiving vessel. This can readily be effected by the following device: Around two poles of a length equal to that of the table, and an inch or two in diameter, roll cotton-batting, or pieces of blanket, until the whole is about three inches in diameter. Two ordinary blankets rolled tightly, as shown in Fig. 100, will suffice. At intervals of a foot connect these side-bars by wisps of bandage-cloth long enough to hold the bars parallel with each other, and with the long edges of the table on which they rest.

316 A TEXT-BOOK ON SURGERY. The interrupted plaster dressing is more difficult of application. The entire leg and foot, and half way up the thigh, are covered with a dry flannel or muslin roller, which passes over the wound, retaining the sub- limate and iodoform gauze in place. A strong piece of bar-h'on, or two or three thicknesses of hoop-iron, or a twist of from four to six ordinary telegraph-wires, is now shaped to follow the outline of the foot and leg up to within three inches of the wound and exits of the drainage-tubes, at which point it is bent up for several inches, and passes over the wound much like the handle of a valise (see Fig. 351). As soon as a point three inches above the wound is reached it is again made to conform to the Fig. 351. shape of the leg and thigh. A separate straight piece of iron, or, if needed, two pieces, about sixteen inches in length, are also prepared. A layer of absorbent cotton is placed around the leg and thigh before the first bandage is applied, and over this the plaster rollers are carried, above and below the fracture, to within three inches of the wound. After several layers of bandage (generally three thicknesses) have been applied, this much is allowed to harden, and upon this the long iron splint is laid, in front, and the short pieces posteriorly and laterally (out of the way of the drainage-tubes), and are fixed by additional turns of the plaster bandages and by plaster mortar worked in with the hands. That portion of the bar which is shaped like the handle of a valise should be stiffened by winding around it several thicknesses of the plaster roll- ers, and adding a sufficient quantity of plaster mortar. Suspension is made from the ends and center of the wire.

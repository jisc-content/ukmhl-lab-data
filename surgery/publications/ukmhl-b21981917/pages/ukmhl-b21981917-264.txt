The second and third portions of both vessels are identical as re- gards direction and relation, being different in the origins of their respective branches. The second surgical division of each is entire- ly to the inner side of the inner border of the first rib. The third portion rests chiefly on the upper surface of the first rib, and extends from the outer border of the scalenus anticus to the lower border of this rib. The first portion of the right subclavian varies from three fourths to one inch and a half in length, the average length being 1'15 inch. The first portion of the left artery varies from one inch and a half to three inches, the average length being 2'06 inches.

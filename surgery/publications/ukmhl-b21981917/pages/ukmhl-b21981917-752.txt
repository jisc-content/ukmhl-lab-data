738 A TEXT-BOOK ON SURGERY. Tlie flaps are now brought into position, the space formerly occnpied by the horny part of the nail packed with sublimate gauze, and the entire toe enveloped in the same material. A narrow bandage should be applied firmly enough to hold the gauze in place, and to exercise sufiicient com- pression to prevent bleeding. Over this a generous piece of protective should be thrown and a second bandage applied. When, in applying this bandage, the elastic ligature is reached, it should be taken off and the roller carried on to the foot. A single dressing usually suffices, and it need not be removed for ten days or two weeks. Deformities of the Upper Extremity—Glamcle.—Congenital absence of portions of one or both of these bones may exist. No case of complete absence of the collar-bone is as yet on record. The partial deficiency may occur on one or both sides, and is usually at the inner extremity. The indications in treatment are to use a figure-of-8 brace around the shoulders to prevent them from being approximated in part by the actions of the pectoral muscles. Paralysis of the deltoid and serratus magnus muscles imparts to the shoulder a deformed appearance. In deltoid paresis the shoulder is flattened, and the acromion process more prominent and easily recog- nized. The arm is incapable of being lifted to a right angle with the spine. It may be due to injury of the circumflex nerve, or to a cen- tral nervous lesion. When the serratus magnus is paralyzed, the ver- tebral border of the scapula is tilted outward in a position of unusual prominence. Neither of these injuries is amenable to surgical treatment.

Anchylosis of the shoulder is more amenable to the operation of ex- section than to forcible breaking up of the adhesions. This last proced- ure may be employed in cases of partial anchylosis in which no inflam-

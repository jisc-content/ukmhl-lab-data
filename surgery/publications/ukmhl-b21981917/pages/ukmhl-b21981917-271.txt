LIGATION OF ARTERIES. be seen. The vein lies internal to the artery, often overlapping it, and should be drawn carefully backward. The median nerve overlies the artery, or is on its anterior aspect, and should be drawn forward when the needle is passed from behind forward (Pig. 294). Ligation of the Brachial Artery —Anatomy.—This artery lies in the furrow along the inner border of the coraco-brachialis and biceps muscles, tending more and more to the front as it nears the elbow-joint. In the lower half or three fourths of its course it has its venae comites on either side, with occasional commu- nications across the track of the ar- tery. The median nerve crosses it by the front, from the outer side, on its way to the forearm, while the basilic vein is well to the in- ner side. As this vein passes up toward the axilla it pierces the deep fascia, and lies on the inner side and close to the artery, joining with the venae comites to form a single large trunk. Operation.—K line drawn from the junction of the middle and ante- rior thirds of the axillary space (as above given) to the middle of the elbow-joint, in front, will pass over the brachial artery in its entire length. The place of election is the middle of the arm. At this point make an in- cision, three inches in length, over the artery and in its axis. Divid- ing the skin and deep fascia, the white cord of the median nerve will be first seen, on the outer side of the brachial, overlapping the companion vein on this side. Just internal to this is the artery, with the other ac- companying vein and the basilic in close relation (Fig. 295). The liga- ture should be passed from the in- ner toward the outer side.

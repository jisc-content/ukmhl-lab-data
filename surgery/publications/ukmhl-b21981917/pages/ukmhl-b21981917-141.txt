AMPUTATIONS. 127 humerus, disarticulate, and saw off the articular surface as in the pre ceding operation. The drainage is from the highest point in the perpen dicular incision. Fig. 189 shows the anatomical rela- tions near the line of section of the soft parts involved in this amputation. Arm. —The circular skin-and-mus- cle flap is always preferable, except in cases of extraordinary muscular development, or an excessive quanti- ty of subcutaneous areolar tissue. First Method.—Make a circular cut through the skin at a point suf- ficiently below the line of section through the humerus to permit a suitable covering. Allow the skin to retract up the arm, and at this point divide everything smoothly and squarely down to the bone. Render the skin and muscles tense, push the point of the scalpel down to the bone on the outer side of the arm, and lay the flap open by an incision which is parallel with the axis of the humerus, periosteum up to the point where the saw is to be applied, and, after pro- tecting the soft parts with a retractor, divide the bone. The drainage should be from the upper extremity of the perpendicular cut, which, Fig. ISO.—Showing sutures applied and exit of drains in amputation at the lower and middle thirds of tlie humerus.

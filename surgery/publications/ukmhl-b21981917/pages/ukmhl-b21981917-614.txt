600 A TEXT-BOOK ON SURGERY. When symptoms of obstruction to the escape of urine supervene, oper- ative interference is frequently called for. If the hypertrophy is gen- eral, and the caliber of the urethra is encroached upon, dilatation by means of the olive-pointed French bougies or the conical steel sounds Fig. 602.—Hypertrophy of tlie prostate, showing the asymmetrical development of the middle or third lobe, a a, Openings of ureters. (After Socin.) may be required. When the enlargement is chiefly in the posterior portions of the organ, dilatation is not indicated. In order to prevent cystitis, it is important that every effort should be made to thoroughly empty the bladder at each act of urination. The relation of the urethra to the base of the bladder, in the normal condition of the prostate, is well shown in Fig. 601. The impediment to the complete evacuation of the bladder in enlargement of the posterior and middle portions of this body may be more readily understood by referring to Figs. 602 and 603. If the sitting or standing posture is maintained, it is evident that a certain quan- tity of urine will remain in the cul-de-sac, behind the prostate, even if the ball- valve formed by the hyper- trophied middle lobe is held Fig. 603.—Antero-posterior section of tlie same specimen, back by the catheter. In many cases this difficulty may be overcome and benefit gained by evacuating the bladder, with or without the catheter, in the knee-shoulder position. The introduction

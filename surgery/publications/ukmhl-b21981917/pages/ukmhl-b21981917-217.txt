ANEURISM. 203 being one or more branches given oif between the ligature and the sac (Hunter's method), or without an intervening branch (Anel), or on the distal side without (Brasdor), or with (Wardrop) an intervening branch, or close to the tumor on both the distal and cardiac side, with or vsdthout extirpation of the tumor (Antyllus) (Fig. 272). When interrupted pressure upon the main trunk, on the cardiac side of an aneurism, is possible, it is the first method of treatment to be adopted. It can only be contra-indicated when the tumor is so near to the great cavities from which the arteries emerge that there is not sufii- cient room for its accomplishment, or when, on account of the anatomical arrangement of contiguous nerves and veins, compression is painful or inexpedient, or when, as will occur only in exceptional instances, rupture is imminent; then the ligature is demanded. Compression may be manual or instrumental, and continuous or in- terrupted. Given a popliteal aneurism, as an illustration, compression on the cardiac side, with an intervening branch, may be employed as fol- lows : Digital or Manual.â€”The patient, being placed in a position comfort- able to himself and convenient to the operator, is, if the necessity de- mands, put under the iniiuence of an opiate or ansesthetic. Compression is then made with the pulp of the thumb laid upon the femoral artery, just where it crosses the rim of the pelvis, until pulsation in the tumor is diminished or arrested. Additional force is gained by pressing the thumb or fingers of the opposite hand on the dorsum of the thumb first employed. When from fatigue further compression is impossible, the operator is relieved by the next of the detail, and so on. After a lapse of from two or three hours to at times as much as three days, the tumor ceases to pulsate, becomes firm and inelastic, and remains permanently occluded.

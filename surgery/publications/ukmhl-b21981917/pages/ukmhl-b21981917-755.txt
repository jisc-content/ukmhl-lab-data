THE FINGERS AND HAND. 741 The Fingers and Hand.—Among the congenital deformities of the fingers are polydactylus, syndactylus, and web-finger, or fusion of two or more digits. The acquired deformities are due to contraction of the palmar fascia, of the muscles and tendons, to paralysis of certain mus- cles, and to osseous and articular lesions, both traumatic and idiopathic. Supernumerary Finger {Polydactylus).—The usual location of one extra finger is on the radial side of the thumb or ulnar aspect of the little finger, near the metacarpo-phalangeal junction (Fig. 743). It may or may not possess phalanges or cartilages. If the phalanges exist, a synovial cavity will be found at the Junction with the metacarpal bone, or with the phalanx of the normal member. Fig. 743.—Supernumerary digits. (After Eeeves.) Fig. 744.—Double hand. (After Eeeves.) A rare form of supernumerary fingers is shown in Fig. 744, in which there is practically a double hand. Amputation of the supernumerary members should be made soon after birth. In syndactylus, all or a portion of one or more fingers may be want- ing (Fig. 745). Amputation of the deformed portion is usually advisable. Web-finger is usually congenital, although it may be acquired. In mild cases, where the union between the contiguous surfaces is slight, and the web is thin, the following method wUl succeed: A round elastic ligature or cord is carried through the web just in front of the metacarpo- phalangeal articulation, and the ends are turned back and attached to a band around the wrist (Fig. 746). This is allowed to remain for three

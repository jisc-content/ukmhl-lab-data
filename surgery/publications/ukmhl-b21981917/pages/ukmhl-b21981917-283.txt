LIGATION OF ARTERIES. 269 leolus it will be found one third the distance from the tip of the mal- leolus to the convexity of the heel. The Anterior Tibial at the Middle of the Leg. —A line from a point half way between the anterior tuberosity of the tibia and the head of the fibula to a like point between the two malleoli, in front of the ankle, will indicate the position of this artery. At the middle of the leg make a four-inch incision in this line, di- viding everything down to the dense fascia im- mediately over the mus- cles. Split this on a di- rector and dissect it up carefully, searching for the interspace between the tibialis anticus in- ternally and the exten- sor proprius pollicis ex- ternally. Finding this, discard the knife, and with the finger separate the muscles, and the ar- tery, veins, and nerve will be found deep down upon the interosseous membrane, the nerve be- ing external and slight- ly in front, and the veins wound about the artery. In order to re- lax the muscles and ad- mit the light, flex the tarsus on the leg (Fig. 306).

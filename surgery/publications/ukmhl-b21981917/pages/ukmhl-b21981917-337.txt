323 DISLOCATIONS. Fig. 359.—(Bryant.) a dislocation. Another excellent method of differentiation is that of Callaway, based upon the fact that the circumference, measured over the acromial end of the clavicle and the acromion, and through the axilla, is in a dislocation much increased over the normal, or over that present in fracture at the neck. Crepitus, v^hen obtained, will deter- mine a fracture. Reduction—First Method.—Place the patient upon a table, bed, or upon the floor. For the left shoulder the operator removes the shoe from the left foot and places it in the axilla, against the thorax. He now Fig. 358.—(Erichsen.) seizes the arm and forearm of the patient, carries it out at a right angle to the axis of the patient's spine, and makes powerful traction in the direction of the glenoid cavity. While this is being effected the arm is brought inward, parallel with and against the side of the body (Fig. 358). The foot not only serves to effect counter-extension, but is also used as a fulcrum for lifting the head of the bone over the edge of the glenoid facet into the articular cavity of this process. If this can not be accom- plished without ether, after one or two trials the an- sesthetic should be given. After reduction a shoul- der-cap of book-binder's board, leather, or gutta- percha should be applied, and worn for at least one week. Second Method.—Fix the scapula by placing a folded sheet or long cloth around the body, so that the upper margin of the cloth will touch the axillary folds. The ends are intrusted to an assistant, who, standing on the sound side, makes counter-exten- sion. The surgeon now takes hold of the arm about its middle with one hand, and near the elbow with the other, and carries it slowly and steadily away from the body, and

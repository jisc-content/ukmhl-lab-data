417 THE LIPS AND CHEEKS. be freshened and freely lifted by dissection, and the sutures intro- duced. It will be observed that as the edges are approximated, the lines dk, h j\ m /, and Ih, will be united with cJc, aj, me, and I g. A third method, which is useful in certain cases, is as follows : After the disease is removed, an incision, c a (Fig. 482), is carried from the alse of the nose upward and outward. The length of this cut and its obliquity de- pend upon the distance to be filled be- tween the normal line of the lip and the nose. A second incision, a b, is now carried deeply downward and out- ward, making a quadrilateral flap, which hinges at h and is dissected up, and the edges, c a, are brought in apposition and secured in the median line. Lower Lip.—When the loss of tissue has left a cavity triangular in shape, as in Fig. 483, that one of the following methods may be selected which in the judgment of the opera- tor is best adapted to the case : Fig. 482.—(After Linbart.) Fig. 484.—(After Linhart.) Both flaps are now loosened and Along the Fig. 483.—(After Szymanowsky.) 1. A horizontal cut, a h (Fig. 484), is made outward from the angle of the lip, and a second one, h c, parallel with the freshened edge of the Assure. slid toward the median line, and united by pins or sutures free border of the new lip stitch the mu- cous membrane to the skin with fine silk sutures. The gap left on either side is also wholly or partially closed by sutures. 2. For the same defect make a semi- circular incision outward and downward from each angle of the mouth, c g d and afe (Fig. 485). Dissect this flap up freely and slide toward the middle line. The pin- sutures are inserted as in Fig. 486, taking Fig. 485.—(After Szymanowsky.) 27

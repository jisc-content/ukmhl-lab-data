The invagination is usiTally from above downward ; in rare instances from below upward. Very exceptionally both conditions exist in the same subject.* It oc- curs in males more fi'e- quentlj^ than in fe- males, and, while it may be met Avith at any period of life, it is much more common in children than in adults. A large pro- portion of cases occur in the first six years of life, and of these the first, second, and thhd years are most prolific. Intussusception is usually caused by spas- modic contraction of a limited ]3ortlon of the circular muscular fibers of the intestinal wall, whereby this por- tion, becoming small- er and firmer, is either overlapped and in- cluded by the part im- mediately below, or falls into it. Paralysis of the circular muscle would produce the same condition. It may result from the dragging of a neoplasm developed in the wall of the gut, from the lodgment of a foreign body, or fecal matter. Invagination may be acute or chronic, may cause complete obstruc- tion at once, or only partially occlude the intestinal canal during its en- tire existence. The character of the symptoms will in part depend upon the location of the accident. When the ileum and coecum are involved, the symptoms of obstruc- tion are more acute. In subacute and chronic cases the colon is usually involved. The symptoms of intussusception may be those of acute or gradual obstruction, as the invagination is acute, subacute, or chronic. In general, pain is present, and is continuous or spasmodic, being referred to the region in which the lesion exists. Tenderness is not present at first, but is developed as the inflammatory changes in the in- testine and peritonaeum appear.

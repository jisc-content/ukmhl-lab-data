When completed and turned down, a diamond-shaped or elliptical opening is formed (Fig. 470). The pins should be introduced from near the lateral angles. Fifth Method—Operation of Graefe.—Make a horseshoe-shaped in- cision along the apex of the fissure, as at a (Fig. 471), and remove the Fio. 471.—(Alter Kocnig, Graefe.) Fig. 472. included tissue together with a narrow strip along the edge of the fissure on one side, as at &, through the free border of the lip. Upon the op- posite side, and near the middle of the fissure, an incision through the thickness of the lip is made in a direction outward and slightly down- ward, as at c. In approximating the edges (see Fig. 472), the receding angle at a is united to b on the opposite side, and the tip of the free border, d, is stitched to c. The modification of this procedure by Koenig is preferable in cases where the gap has unusual width at the vermilion border. The horse- shoe incision at a is the same as in the preceding operation, but there Fig. 473.—(After Koenig.) Fig. 474.—(After Koenig.) are two lateral horizontal incisions, 2-^ (Fig. 473). The wound has the shape shown in Fig. 474, and in approximating the edges the apices of the two flaps, b c (Fig. 473), are brought together at the level of a (Fig. 474). Complete Single Hare-Lip—First Method—Colles^s Operation.—In certain cases where the fissure is of great width, and extends through the floor of the nose, important modifications of the foregoing procedures are at times necessary. The operation is one of considerable difficulty, not only as to the closure of the fissure, but on account of the flattening of the wing of the nose on the affected side.

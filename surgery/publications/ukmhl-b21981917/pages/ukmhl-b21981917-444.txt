In severe cases a false joint may be successfully established by section of the bone anterior to the point of tixation, usual- ly at or above the angle. Care must be taken to make frequent pas- sive motion in order to prevent union of the divided ends. The Teeth. Extraction.—Dental forceps should be of different patterns, the jaws bent at various angles to the shaft, and the handles large enough to be grasped firmly and securely by the operator. The gum immediately around the neck of the tooth should be free- ly incised with a lancet, since if this precaution is not taken it may be unnecessarily torn away with the tooth. The injection of cocaine around the tooth will render the cutting pain- less. The jaws of the forceps are applied on either side of the neck, and forced doT\Ti to- ward the root until they grasp the tooth firmly at the margin of its alveolar insertion. The normal direction of the Fig. 502.—Incisor, straight root. Fig. 503.—Incisor, half-curved root. Fig. 504.—Wolverton's upper bicuspids. direction of traction is determined by the axis of the tooth. In extracting the incisors and canine teeth, the for- cej)s represented in Figs. 602 and 503 are applied as described above, and, when firmly fixed, a slight forward and backward movement, with limited rotation, vnll loosen the root, while traction should at the same time be made in a direction upward and slightly forward for the low- er jaw, and downward for the teeth of the upper row. For the bicuspids and molars, the instruments shown in Figs. 504, 505, and 606 are preferable. The bicuspids and molars may be loosened by lateral motion or rock- FiG. 505.—"Wolverton's lower bicuspids.

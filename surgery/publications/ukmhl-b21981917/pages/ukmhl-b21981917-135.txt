121 AMPUTATIONS. until the junction of the middle and upper third of the metacarpal bone of the index-finger is reached, whence it travels across the back of the hand to join the end of the palmar incision (Figs. 173, 174). Fig. 1Y2. Fig. 173. Fig. 174. Fig. 175. Amputation of the thumb with disarticulation at the carpo-metacarpal junction should be done as follows : Just over the carpo-metacarpal joint on the dorsal aspect of the hand commence an incision, and carry it directly along the metacarpal bone until half way to the metacarpo-pha- langeal articulation, from which point it is made to travel along the groove between the thumb and index-finger to the middle of the web between these two members, thence on around the base of the thumb until the dorsal incision is reached (Fig. 175). In the case shown in Fig. 176.—Epithelioma of thumb. (From a patient at Mt. Sinai Hospital.) Fig. 177.—The same, after amputa- tion at the carpo-metacarpal joint. Figs. 176 and 177 this operation was performed. In amputation of the little finger, at the carpo-metacarpal joint, a similar incision is made (Fig. 178).

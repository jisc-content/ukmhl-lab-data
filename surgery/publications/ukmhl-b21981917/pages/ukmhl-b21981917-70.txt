In snch. con- ditions a flannel bandage, properly applied from the end of the extremity up to the inflamed area, will be advisable. If the swelling becomes so intense as to threaten gangrene, or even, by excessive tension of the part, Fig. 114.â€”Fluhrer's swinging cradle (Mt. Sinai Hospital). to give extreme pain, free incisions should be made parallel with the axis of the limb, extending well through to the deep fascia, and through this if necessary. These incisions, made so as not to divide the vessels, should be left open and treated with strict antisepsis. Blood-letting, either by venesection or by leeches, or scarification and cupping, are to be employed in certain selected cases. In plethoric indi- viduals, with high febrile movement and bounding pulse, venesection may be done with marked and immediate benefit. The operation should be performed in the median cephalic vein as follows (Fig. 115): Apply a bandage around the middle of the upper arm sufficiently tight to occlude the veins, but not to arrest the arterial circulation. Produce local anaes- thesia at the point of incision by injecting from 5 to 10 minims of 4-per- cent .cocaine beneath the skin in the line of the median cephalic vein {not median hasilic). Ether spray, or salt and ice, may be employed if cocaine can not be obtained. Make an incision from a half-inch to one inch long, varying with the amount of subcutaneous fat, and directly over the vein until it is well exposed. With a curved pair of scissors now make a valvular slit about half through the vein. The amount of blood to be withdrawn will be determined by the impression made upon the radial pulse of the opposite arm, and in part by the sensation of the patient. From 8 to 16 ounces will usually suffice.

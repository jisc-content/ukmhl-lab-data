REGIONAL SURGERY.—THE HEAD. 377 poison is introduced through the wound, and when the bones are not penetrated. Penetrating Wounds of the Skull.—When a foreign body has pene- trated the cranial cavity and passed out, and the patient survives the im- mediate effect of the accident, the wounds of entrance and exit should be cleansed of loose fragments of bone, or any foreign body. To accomplish this it will be not only justifiable, but often imperative, to enlarge both openings, by use of the trephine, and, while employing strict antiseptic precautions, to secure free drainage for the discharge of blood or other fluids from the track of the missile. When severe intra-cranial haemor- rhage occurs, no attempt should be made to arrest it by plugging the wounds through the skull, for fatal compression of the brain might thus result. If the vessels involved can not be reached from the enlarged openings, and secured by haemostatic forceps or the ligature, the head of the patient should be elevated, in order to diminish the pressure at the bleeding point. This may in part be aided by ligation of the extremi- ties, as heretofore described. If there is only a single opening, and the body is lodged within the cranium, a careful inspection should be made about the wound of en- trance, and, if the presence of the missile can be recognized, it should be at once extracted, even if the application of the trephine is required. If the bullet shaU have entered the substance of the brain—which can be determined in part by the careful employment of a light Nelaton's probe, provided with a good-sized porcelain tip, introduced through the wound in the skull, sufficiently enlarged by the trephine—the probabilities are that it has passed through the brain in the line of projection of the missile, and is lodged beneath the skull, at or near a point dii-ectly in the line of its projection. This condition was found to exist in the remarkable case operated on by Prof. W. F. Fluhrer, in Belle- vue Hospital, in 1884. The patient, aged nine- /^^TTT^^ teen years, received a pistol-shot wound, enter- /' \ ing at the forehead and passing through the „ j . brain, in the line shown in Fig. 413. The hole ^ J of entrance was enlarged by biting off the edges ] ' of the bone with a rongeur. An alarming ^^-^-^y^^^^^ haemorrhage from a vessel of the pia mater was y/Ly"^^ x ^\ controlled by a small artery-clamp, or forceps. / k--^ \ The patient's head was placed so that the sup- ( h ' f posed track to be explored was perpendicular / ' / * to the surface of the table. A good-sized por- Fig. 413.-Flulirer's caseof per.e- celain-pointed Nekton's probe was carefully in- tfll^^'IXSlt:^:) troduced, and allowed almost to find its own way in the track left by the bullet. This instrument passed to a depth of six inches, where, a slight resistance being met with, it was allowed to remain. The direction of the probe indicated the point on the oppo- site side of the skull, at which the missile had most probably struck. Three fourths of an inch below this line the trephine was applied. Upon removing the disk of bone the dura mater appeared dark from blood

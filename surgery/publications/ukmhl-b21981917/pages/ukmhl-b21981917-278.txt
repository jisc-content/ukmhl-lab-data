A TEXT-BOOK ON SURGERY. 264 great cord of tlie sciatic nerve will now be seen emerging from beneath the muscle, and immediately in front of this the small sciatic nerve and the sciatic artery. The internal pudic artery is just anterior to this, upon the spine of the ischium (Fig. 299, middle incision). The sciatic artery may also be secured opposite the tuher ischii, along the outer bor- der of which it runs (Fig. 299, lower incision). The Internal Pudic in the PeriiKBum.—With the patient supine and the thigh abducted, ' " ^" make an incision in a line with the symphysis pubis and tiiber ischii. The artery will be found as it runs along the inner margin of the ramus of the pubis (Fig. 300). Ligation of the Ex- ternal Iliac in its Lower Portion. —The external iliac has in relation to it the accompanying vein internally. The spermat- ic vessels cross it, and in the male the vas deferens is internal to it at the in- guinal ring. Operation.—One inch to the inner side of the anterior superior spine of the ilium commence an incision, which is car- ried in the direction of the middle of Poupart's ligament, and terminates one inch above this point, without entering the in- ternal ring. Divide the three muscles down to the transversalis fascia, arrest all bleeding, divide the fascia carefully, re- tract the upper lip of the wound, and lift the peri- tonseiim from the iliac fossa and artery (Fig. 301). Displace any overlying lymphatics and in- troduce the needle from the inner side.* Fig. 301.—Ligation of the external iliac in its lower portion, and of the femoral in Hunter's canal. * Ligation of the external iliac has proved fatal in almost every instance in which it was tied for haemorrhage. For aneurism about 67 per cent recover.

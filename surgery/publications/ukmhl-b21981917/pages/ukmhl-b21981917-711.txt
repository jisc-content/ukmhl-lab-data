.i597 ROTARY-LATERAL CURVATURE. This perforated corset is made as follows: A plaster-of-Paris jacket is applied as hereafter directed, and as soon as this hardens (in from ten to thirty minutes) it is split down the median line in front, removed from the body, and the cut edges placed and held in apposition by a bandage carried around and over the entire Jacket. This shell is to be used as a mold in which a cast of the deformed thorax is to be made. It is thoroughly greased on its inner surface, placed upon the floor, and filled with stiff plaster-mortar. When this hardens, the shell is removed, leaving an exact cast of the tho- FiG. 676.—Corset made after Vance's method. Fig. 677.—The same, applied. spring steel about one eighth of an inch wide and very thin, and one yard of Canton flannel. Place the flannel with the soft plush next to the plaster, and stitch this tightly to the model, so that it is not wrinkled. It should be sewed only along the middle line in front. The glue should now be dissolved in warm water. Strips of bandage about two feet long and two inches in width are dipped in the glue and laid on the flannel which is around the model. As soon as a single thick- ness has been applied, strips of the steel wire, cut not quite as long as the corset, are placed one inch apart over its entire surface, and held in place by a string wound around as they are laid on. A long, dry roller is next carried around the model from above downward, and drawn so tight that the steel springs are made to conform exactly to the surface of the corset. Upon this two additional layers of the short strips of roller dipped in glue are laid. The corset should be left for several hours in the hot sun, or by a fire, until it is thoroughly dried. It is then split down the front, removed, and the edges bound with chamois-skin. Hooks for lacing should be fastened along the edges

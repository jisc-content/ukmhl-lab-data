In adjusting the flaps, the sawn surface of the calcaneum is brought into apposition with that of the tibia (Fig. 220). Or, having exposed the tibio-tarsal joint, divide the ligaments, disarticulate, as in Syme's operation, and, having drawn the astra- galus and calcaneum forward until the upper Fig. 221. Fig. 220.â€”Stump after Le Fort's amputation. (Le Fort.) portion of the as calcis is exposed, insert a key-hole saw behind the tuberosity, and saw through this bone on the line already indicated. Gunther's modification of this procedure is shown in Figs. 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, taken from Esmarch's hand-book, and the crescentic section the same source. In amputations of the foot the following rules should be observed: The terminal phalanges of all the toes should be removed by disarticula- tion when it becomes necessary to remove a portion of the entire thickness of these bones. The same rule applies to all the second phalanges, ex-

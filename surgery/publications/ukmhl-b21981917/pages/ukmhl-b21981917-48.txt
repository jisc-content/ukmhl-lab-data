Instruments.â€”Much of success in practice depends upon the pos- _ session of a variety of instruments which should be of the very- best material, made after well-approved patterns, and as simple in construction as possible. The best instruments are now made with good-sized handles, not large enough to be cumbersome, but sufficiently large to be grasped firmly in the hand. For all knives, retractors, gouges, etc., the handles are made of vulcan- ized rubber, which is molten on to the steel, and does not therefore require to be riveted. This material is suscep- tible of a high polish, and is easily kept clean. All sur- faces should be perfectly smooth and plain, even to the extent of omitting the stamp of the manufacturer. For amputations and ordinary operations on the soft parts and bones, the following articles are required: For making flaps by transfixion, two amputating- Jcnives. The largest of these (Fig. 47) * measures 17 inch- es over all, or 12 inches for the cutting blade, the width of which is five eighths of an inch. The rubber handle has a circumference of two and a half inches. Fig. 48 represents a smaller knife of a similar pat- tern, the blade of which is only eight inches long by half an inch wide. The scalpels are eight in number, the blades ranging from two and a half to three fourths of an inch in length. Fig. 49. Fig. 50. The handles are large enough to be firmly held, and the end of each is shaped into a dry dissector (I'igs. 49 and 50). * These cuts are made from the instruments in my general operating-case.

A TEXT-BOOK ON SURGERY, 494 by the peritonseum lining the abdominal cavity. The sac may be car- ried immediately in front of the escaping intestine or omentum (femoral, umbilical, etc.), or these viscera may descend into a sac already fonned by the escape of some other organ (inguinal, scrotal). In the rare cases of hernia of those portions of the large intestine not covered by perito- naeum there is no true sac. If the intestine alone enters into the forma- tion of a hernia, it is called enterocele; if omentum alone, epiplocele; if both are inclosed in the sac, entero-epiplocele. The coverings of a hernia outside of the sac will vary with its location, and vtill be given in the consideration of the different varieties. A hernia is said to be reducible^ when the contents of the sac can by any means be returned into the cav- ity of the abdomen ; irreducible, when adhesions exist to such an extent that this can not be effected ; strangulated, when the circulation in the tumor is arrested by constriction at any portion (usually at the neck). f^G. 534.—The relations of the points of escape of oblique and direct inguinal and obturator hernias to the important vessels of the pelvis. 1, Internal abdominal ring. 2, Point at which a direct inguinal hernia commences. 3, Obturator canal, artery, and nerve.

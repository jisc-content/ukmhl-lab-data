365 EXSECTIONS OF THE JOINTS. vessels which may have been divided. The limb is allowed to remain undisturbed for from ten to thirty days. The drills are removed at about the end of the fourth week. As in all the antiseptic operations, the indi- cations for a change of dressing are hfemorrhage, high temperatures, and decomposition of the discharge beyond the zone of asepsis. When the wound is dressed, careful antisepsis should be practiced. Eecovery, with anchylosis in the straight position, is the result. No elfort at passive motion should be entertained. This operation has met with remarkable success within late years. The drills or nails should always be preferred. When they can not be obtained, the parts may be held in apposition by wiring the bones together and applying an interrupted plaster-of-Paris dressing, as shown in Fig. 397. The Ankle-joint.—For the complete exsection of the articular ends of the tibia and fibula and the astragalus, proceed as follows : Commence an incision on the internal surface of the tibia, about two inches above Fig. 398. Fi&. 399. the tip of the inner malleolus, and carry it directly down to this point, and thence directly forward, from one inch to one inch and a half along the tarsus, in the direction of the metatarsal bone of the great toe (Fig. 398). A like L-shaped incision is made upon the fibular side of the joint (Fig. 399). These incisions divide all the tissues down to the bone. With Fig. 400.—Volkmann's anterior splint, the Sayre elevator lift the periosteum, with its attachments to the super- jacent soft tissues undisturbed, from the diseased portions of bone. Ex- pose the outer malleolus and fibula as high as it is deemed necessary to remove this bone, and divide it with the exsector (or chisel). As soon as the piece is removed the joint is thoroughly exposed to view. Now,

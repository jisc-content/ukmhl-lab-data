184 A TEXT-BOOK ON SURGERY. The treatment of arteritis resolves itself simply into the treatment of the disease of which it is a part. It would be useless to increase the length of this article by a re- capitulation of the various methods and remedies which have been employed. If the pathogeny and pathology of the atfection are understood, its therapy is not difficult. Arterial TTironibosis and Embolism. — Though not as frequent as in phlebitis, throm- bosis and embolism often re- sult from arteritis. The pa- thology of thrombosis has been given in the section on phlebi- tis. The process in the arteries is closely analogous to that in the veins. The perfect type of throm- bosis from acute, traumatic arteritis, is found after the application of an occluding ligature around an artery. By reason of arrest of the blood-current and disturbance of the equi- librium normally existing between the blood and the containing vessels, coagulation takes place on the cardiac side of the ligature, extending back as a rule to the first collateral branch. Immediately following the injury to the vessel, the process of inflammation—true arteritis—com- mences. The tension of the ligature to such a degree as to divide the Fig. 264—Arteritis with chronic nephritis.

313 FRACTURES. the direction of the line of fracture. Marked overlapping or disj)lace- ment is prevented by the unbroken fibula. In the upper portion, with a transverse fracture, the deformity is slight. At the lov^er and middle third the obliquity is usually considerable, and from below upward and backward (Fig. 345). The upper fragment is tilted forward by the action of the quad- riceps extensor, and partly by the pressure of the upper end of the lower fragment, which is thrown in the same direction by the contraction of the sural muscles and the consequent lifting of the heel.

(After Gray.) deformity in Pott's fracture is shown in Fig. 346. In complete fracture of both bones of the leg, overlapping and displacement are the rule. Diagnosis.—Fracture of the fibula alone may exist without detection, although a careful examination, with direct pressure, will usually elicit crepitus or reveal the point of fracture by abnormal mobility and pain. Fracture of the tibia is easily made out by palpation along the spine, crepitus, loss of symmetry, and pain. These symptoms, together with the history of the accident, will leave little room for doubt in any case. Pott's fracture is recognized by the peculiar eversion of the foot, the ab- normal prominence of the internal malleolus, pain, and loss of function. Crepitation of the fragments of the malleoli may be elicited, and preter- natural mobility in the fibula, at a point two or three inches above the tip of the outer malleolus. In inversion with fracture the outer malleolus is prominent. Fracture of both bones is easily made out by the deform- ity, abnormal mobility, and crepitation. Treatment.—In most cases of fracture of one or both bones of the leg it is the best practice to reduce the displacement by extension and coun-

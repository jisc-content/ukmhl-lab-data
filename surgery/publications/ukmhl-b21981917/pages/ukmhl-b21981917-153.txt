AMPUTATIONS. 139 Syme's amputation at the ankle has been modified by the osteoplastic operations of Pirogotf, Le Fort, Gunther, and others. Pirogoff''s Method.—The dorsal and plantar incisions are made from the same points, and are practically the same as in Syme's amputation. However, in order to avoid redundancy of the soft tissues and to expose the calcaneum back to the line of section of this bone, the lower incision should, when it reaches the sole of the foot, be carried back about three fourths of an inch nearer the heel than in Syme's method. The dorsal incision does not ascend so high upon the ankle by the same distance. The joint is opened through the an- terior incision, and the lateral ligaments di- vided until the ante- rior upper surface of the OS calcis can be dis- placedforward through the articulation, when it is sawn through on the line indicated in Fig. 214, the instrument running parallel with the edges of the incision. The soft parts are now carefully lifted from the articular ends of the tibia and fibula, and these bones divided horizontally so that all the articu- lar cartilage is removed by the section. The an- gle described by these two lines of section is about 90° (Fig. 214). The flaps are adjusted so that the plane of the calcaneum is brought snugly Fig. 213.—(After Esmarch.)

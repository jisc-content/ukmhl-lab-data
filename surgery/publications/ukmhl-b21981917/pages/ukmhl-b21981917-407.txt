393 SURGERY OF THE EAR. Surgery of the Ear. Neoplasms of the auricle require extirpation as in other portions of the body. Angeiomata of small size may be cured, without excision, by injecting the tumor with a few minims of 50-per-cent carbolic-acid solu- tion. Cartilaginous growths are occasionally met with about the ear. Their usual location is just in front of the tragus. I removed two in front of one ear and one from the opposite side in a patient twenty-two years of age. Similar tumors were present in the person of his father and another member of the family. Wounds of the auricle should be treated with the view of preventing any distortion of this organ. Lacerations of the lobule from the violent removal of an ear-ring may be corrected by paring the edges and uniting them by fine silk sutures. The hypodermic use of cocaine will secure perfect anaesthesia in all or- dinary operations upon the auricle. Drooping of the ears to a degree amounting to deformity should be treated in children by strapping the auricles close to the skull, by means of an elastic band around the forehead and occiput.

Adhesions of the auricles to the scalp should be dissected loose, the organs crowded forward, and, if necessary, skin should be transplanted to fill in the gap and prevent a recui'rence of the deformity. Hyper- trophy of the auricle should be corrected by excision of a triangular piece, after the method of Martino, shown in Figs. 430 and 431. Fig. 432.—Sexton's hard-rubber double probe. Auditory Canal.—Foreign bodies in the auditory canal may be recog- nized by inspection or with the light gutta-percha probe (Fig. 432), and should be removed by the careful employment of the angular forceps

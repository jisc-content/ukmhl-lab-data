Operation—First Method.—With the left hand slide the skin toward the shoulder, and at a point sufficiently below the line of section through Fig. 154. the bone to afford ample covering (something more than one half the diameter of the limb, measured where the saw is to be applied), make a circular cut around the member, dividing the skin and subcutaneous fat down to the deep fascia (Fig. 155). The upper margin of this wound is retracted toward the body as far as possible, and, at this line of retraction. with the same knife (a good scalpel is preferable) cut all the remaining soft tissues squarely down to the periosteum (Fig. 156). An incision is next made, parallel with the axis of the humerus, on the outer (or non- vascular) side of the arm, dividing everything to the periosteum, and extending up to the point where the bone is to be sawn through (Fig.

229 SPECIAL ANEURISMS. Operative interference in cases of aneurismal varix is not so fre- quently indicated as in varicose aneurism, owing to the comparatively slow progress of the disease. Experience has shown that deligation of the affected artery is far more dangerous in this condition than in the indirect variety. Fatal secondary haemorrhage is recorded in a number of in- stances, while in others gangrene has resulted from closure of the artery. Compression should be employed as in the treatment of the form just considered. When the lesion is situated in the vessels of an extremity much comfort may be secured by the employment of an elastic bandage or stocking, as in the treatment of venous varix. As a last resort, ampu- tation may be practiced. 15*

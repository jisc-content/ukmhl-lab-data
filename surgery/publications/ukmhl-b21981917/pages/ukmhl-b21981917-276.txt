262 ' A TEXT-BOOK ON SURGERY. Lateral Incision.—Same as for the aorta.* The anterior incision is preferable. Ligation of the Internal and External Iliac Arteries—Anatomy.— The internal iliac artery, less than two inches in length, has the ureter in front, its accompanying vein and the lumbo-sacral nerve behind. Operation.—Through the Peritonaeum. — Proceed as in the same operation for the primitive iliac. If necessary, a transverse incision may be added to that in the linea alba. Behind the Peritonceum.—One inch and a half internal to the anterior superior spine of the ilium begin an incision, which travels downward and inward across the track of the external iliac. Be careful not to carry the deep incision far enough internally to divide the epigastric artery. Cut down to the parietal peritonaeum, and separate this from its attach- Fio. 299.—Ligation of the gluteal, internal pudic, and sciatic arteries. * This arteiy has been tied about seventy times. For aneurism about 33 per cent recovered, while for hemorrhage almost every case ended fatally.

241 LIGATION OF ARTERIES. Anatomy.—Leaving the common trunk at the upper border of the thyroid cartilage., well forward of the anterior border of the sterno- mastoid muscle, this vessel arches forward and upward (its concavity looking toward the lobule of the ear) until, on an average of "92 inch above the bifurcation, after giving off the facial branch, it turns ob- liquely upward and backward to a point opposite the insertion of the external pterygoid muscle into the neck of the condyle of the lower jaw, where it terminates by dividing into the temporal and internal maxillary arteries. Eight regular branches belong to this vessel (though some anatomists, among whom are Hyrtl, Wilson, and Richardson, describe nine). On its anterior aspect arise from below, upward, the tJiyroidea superior, lingualis, maxillaris externa, and maxillaris interna. On its poste- rior and internal aspect the pharyngea ascendens, and posteriorly the occipitalis, auricularis, and temporalis. Po.sterior temporal. Auricular. Occipital. Sterno-mastoid. Pharyngeal.

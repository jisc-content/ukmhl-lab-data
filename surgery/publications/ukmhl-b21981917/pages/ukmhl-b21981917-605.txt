STONE IN THE BLADDER—LITHOTOMY. 591 solid substance has escaped by the urethra, no prolonged effort should be made at this Juncture to demonstrate its presence. The proper posi- tion for the guide is shown in Fig. 588. The shaft is held about perpendicular to the surface of the table, the point well into the bladder, while the convexity of the curve rests against the perinseum. The scrotum is now lifted directly upward, and the primary incision is made with the sharp scalpel (Fig. 63). It commences in the median line about one inch and a half directly in front of the anus, and is carried downward and outward as far as the Fig. 588.—Guide in position in lateral lithotomy.

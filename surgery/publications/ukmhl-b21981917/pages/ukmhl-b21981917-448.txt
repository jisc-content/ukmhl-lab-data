434 A TEXT-BOOK ON SURGERY. Fig. 509. This incision divides the levator palati of either side. The anterior and posterior pillars of the fauces should also be snipped with dull-pointed scissors. All of these wounds close later by granulation. It is important to keep the muscles of this region at rest for a week after the operation. When the cleft extends into the hard palate, as shown in Fig. 510, the fissure may be closed by sliding the membrane lining the vault of the palate. The edges of the fissured soft palate are freshened, as in the preceding operation. Along the edges of the bony fissure an incision (a d, Fig. 510) is made, with a knife shaped like a gum-lancet (Fig. 57), and, by the aid of curved elevators (Fig. 71), the membrane lining the bony palate is carefully lifted with the periosteum. Another incision is now made on either side of the fissure, close to and parallel with the junction of the alveolus with the palate processes, A B, through which the elevator is again introduced, and the periosteum lifted until the whole flap included between B A and the edges of the fissure ab is detached. If severe haemorrhage follows the incision, the wound should be temporarily packed with lint, or pressure with the finger may arrest the bleeding. The flaps are now ready for sliding, and the sutures are introduced along the freshened edges, as in the preceding operation. When the cleft extends still farther forward through the alveolus, and the flssure is wide, it will become necessary to carry the palate pro- cesses toward the median line by an osteoplastic operation. In this procedure no effort is made at lifting the periosteum, and it is better to attempt the approximation of only one portion of the cleft at a sitting. In order to secure all the nutrition possible, the soft palate should be Fig. 509 —(After Agnew.) Fig. 510.—Incisions in sliding the periosteum for clos- ure of the bony cleft.

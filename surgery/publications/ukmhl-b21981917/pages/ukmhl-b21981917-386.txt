372 A TEXT-BOOK ON SURGERY. is made along the outer and dorsal aspect of the metacarpal bone of the little finger, over the styloid of the ulna, and one inch along this bone. The radial incision should commence on the dorsum of the metacarpal bone of the index-finger, pass backward and slightly toward the radial surface of the forearm to a point half an inch above the tip of the styloid process, and thence directly upward along the dorsal aspect of the radius. In extensive operations it may become necessary to divide the tendon of the extensor ossis metacarpi poUicis, which is crossed by the incision. When done, the ends should be reunited by silk sutures when the oper- ation is finished. The tissues are lifted from the bones and capsule as before, and the sections made with the exsector or key-hole saw.

The jury-mast (Fig. 684) consists of a back-piece, in shape not unlike the inverted letter U, made of soft iron, which enables it to be accurately molded to fit the surface to which it is applied. To this are fastened two or three strips of tin, made rough by a series of perforations with an awl. To the upper end of the back-piece a curved bar of light steel is attached, in such a manner that it can be raised or depressed at will. At the end of this crane is a light cross-bar, hooked at each extremity, from which the collar is suspended. After the first two layers of plaster bandages have hardened, the apparatus is bent to fit the surface of the back, and is adjusted to the jacket, with the middle-piece or crane exactly in the median line of the back of the neck and occiput, and its extremity over the center of the top of the head, so that traction by the strips will be directly upward. It is fastened by carrying plaster rollers over the tin strips and back-piece, and working in plaster-mortar. When the plaster hardens the apparatus is immovably incorporated into the jacket. The suspension-collar should now be buckled beneath the occipital protuberance, and the strips tight- ened enough to lift the weight of the head from the neck. The jacket may be converted into a movable corset, by splitting it along the middle line in front and attaching hooks for lacing (Fig. 685). If the jury-mast can not be applied, in ostitis involving the vertebrae between the third and ninth dorsal, Shaffer's modification of Taylor's brace should be pre- ferred.

Bones so affected at times become friable, being readily fractured from the body-weight, or yield a crackling sound upon palpation.* Fig. 767.—Giant-cell sarcoma. From a sarcoma of bone.

The pearl epithelioma is of rare occurrence. Microscopically, it is found to be closely akin to the bird's-nest tumors, which are classed with the malignant growths.

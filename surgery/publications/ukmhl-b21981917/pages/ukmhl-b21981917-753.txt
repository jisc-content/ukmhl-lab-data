Of the congenital variety, occasionally there exists a fusion of the two bones. The length of the forearm is normal, as is the motion at the elbow-joint, but supi- nation and pronation are impossible. In the only case I have ever seen, from which Fig. 741 is taken, the hands were in the prone position. Op- erative interference was not indicated in this instance. Fig. 742.—Deformity resulting from subperiosteal exsection of the entire radius for ostitis. (From a case operated on at the Polyclinic.) Distortions due to rickets are at times met with, and may result from the action of the muscles upon the softened bones, or to pressure from the habitual carrying of burdens in the hands. In destruction of one of the bones of the forearm by ostitis, or after its removal, deformity usually results, the deviation of the hand being toward the side of the missing bone (Fig. 742). Treatment.—In deformity after rickets, correction by osteotomy is justifiable after the disease is arrested. In the distortions due to loss of substance there is little hope of relief. If the loss on one side is limited,

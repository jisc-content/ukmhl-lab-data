529 PELVIC ORGANS. i in which a greater distance intervenes between the end of the defective intestine and the perinseum. Diagnosis.—Absence of the amis is easily established by inspection. The more important and difficult point is to determine the distance from Fig. 552.- -Atresia of the anus and rectum. (After Esmarch.) Fig. 553.—Atresia of the anus and lower portion of the rectum ; the upper part opening into the urethra. (After Esmarch.) the perinseum to the end of the pouch. When the intervening tissue is thin, the accumulation of matter within the tube may cause a protrusion in the perinseum which is exaggerated when the infant cries. If the finger be pressed into the perinseum, an im- pulse somewhat comparable to that felt in the expulsive efi'orts of a pa- tient with hernia may be appreciated. Exploration by the vagina, when the capacity of this tube will permit, will aid in diagnosis. When the intestine opens into an- other hollow organ, or through the integument in an abnormal position, the only diagnostic sign is the pres- ence of fecal matter in the natural discharge from the organ or at the abnormal opening. In atresia recti in female children, the bowel opens most frequently into the uterus or vagina, and in males into the bladder. At times the communication is established between the bowel and the urethra, or a false opening may occur at any point in the perinseum, and, in rarer cases, in some remote portion of the body. 34 Fig. 554.—The same ; the upper portion of the rectum opening into the bladder.

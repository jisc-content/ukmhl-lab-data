A TEXT-BOOK ON SURGERY. 202 order to slacken the blood-current and thus cause coagulation in the aneurism, is now almost entirely abandoned. Though heroic, this plan of treatment is not without good results, as will be shown in the report of cases of special aneurism on a future page.* Tufnell modified Valsalva's method by omitting blood-letting and substituting a restricted diet, with the minimum of fluids. Rest in the recumbent position must be rigidly enforced. Among the remedies which have been recommended for internal administration, iodide of potassium, fluid extract of ergot, alone or with infusion of digitalis, and tincture of the chloride of iron, are worthy of consideration. Among the many surgical procedures instituted for the relief of aneurism, those two which deserve the first consideration are compression and the ligature. In the results achieved in their various methods of application all other treatment may be practically excluded. Compression may be employed on the cardiac side of an aneurism, close to the tumor, without an intervening collateral branch, or at a dis- Antyllus's method. WarJrop's method. Anel's method.

It may be employed on the distal side, with or without intervening anastomosis, or directly to the surface and back of the tumor, or, again, on both periph- eral and central sides, with or without direct compression of the aneurism. The ligature may be applied on the cardiac side of the tumor, there * See "Subclavian Aneurism," fourteen cases by Valsalva's method.

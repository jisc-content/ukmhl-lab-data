INFLAMMATION. .,, 63 cylinder is full. By this manoeuvre the needle and tube are also filled with the solution, and the former is thrust into the cavity of the abscess and held steady by an assistant. The operator now withdraws the piston slowly, so as to give the contents sufficient time to fill the tube, which Fig. 123.â€”Combined aspirator and irrigator. otherwise would collapse from atmospheric pressure. As soon as the cylinder is full the stop-cock is turned, so as to open the emptying tube, which motion also closes the one communicating with the abscess. The contents of the cylinder should now be emptied, and the evacuation con- tinued until the pus ceases to flow. The syringe should now be filled with the 1 to 20 carbolic-acid solution, and the abscess injected until its walls are over-distended, when the fluid is withdrawn. This irrigation and hyper-distention may be repeated several times, until the fluid runs out clear. The needle is then removed, a plug of sublimate gauze placed over the puncture, a sublimate gauze, cotton, and protective dressing over this, and a bandage applied over all tight enough to compress the opposite walls of the abscess firmly together. In aspiration of an abscess it is usually best to employ the large-sized

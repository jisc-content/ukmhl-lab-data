305 FRACTURES. FiQ. 334.—Volkmann's sliding foot-piece. a corresponding notch or groove in the cross-bars. This apparatus is complicated and will rarely be needed. Buck's extension, with Hamil- ton's long splint, or preferably the sand-bags, will meet almost every re- quirement, and give the greatest satis- faction. ■ In order to pre- vent the bed-cloth- ing from coming in contact with the fractured limb, wire screens (Figs. 335, 336) may be em- ployed. In ^ome instances plaster of Paris may be used; but this method of treating fractures above the trochan- ter is now rarely employed. The most easily managed and simply constructed apparatus for making the necessary extension and counter-extension, in applying the fixed dressing for fractures of the lower extremity, is made as follows : Into each end of a ta- ble, about five feet long, two holes are bored, and into these two perpendic- ular pieces are fitted, two feet long and about two inches in diameter, while a strong horizontal bar connects the two upper ends. One of these up- rights is smoothed, round- ed, and padded, to pre- vent injury to the peri- nseum. The foot of the injured side being nicely band- aged, the patient is placed upon the table, astride the padded upright (Fig. 337) , with the perinaeum against it, and is susi^ended by a strap passed over the horizontal bar and underneath the sacrum, being elevated from the table sufiiciently to allow free manipulation of the bandages under the back. The head and shoulders are supported upon pillows, the foot 20 Fig. 335.—(After Esmarch.) L— (Jo Fig. 336.—(After Esmarch.)

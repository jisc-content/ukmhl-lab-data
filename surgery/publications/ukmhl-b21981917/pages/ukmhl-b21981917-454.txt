A TEXT-BOOK OX SURGERY. 440 I am not aware that this method of controlling haemorrhage in this oper- ation has been performed by any other surgeon. When the inferior maxilla is involved, it should be exsected beyond the limit of the disease. If, for any reason, more space is required in the ablation of this organ than can be obtained through the natural orifice, one of the fol- lowing procedures may be adopted 1. (7anf6f incision through the cheek, from the angle of the mouth in the direction of the lobe of the ear as far required (Fig. 513, a). Thi incision gives a full view of the lateral aspect of th tongue, and may be mad upon both sides when the disease is bilateral and ex- tends beyond the middle of the organ. The edges of the wound are afterward brought together by hare-lip pins or silk sutures. 2. Billroth employs a curved incision made paral- lel with the arch of the infe- rior maxilla below the symphysis (Fig. 512), dividing all the tissues on this line until the floor of the mouth is opened. 3. Koclier has lately devised an operation the incision in which is shown by the line hdec (Fig. 513). A preliminary tracheotomy is done, and the pharynx stuffed with a carbolized sponge to which a string is attached. The excision extends along the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid muscle, from the level of the lobule of the ear to the level of the hyoid bone, along this bone to near the median line, and thence to the symphysis menti. The skin and platysma are turned up on the Jaw, the lingual and fa- cial arteries and veins are tied as they are encountered, all enlarged glands are extirpated, the muscles and floor of the mouth separated along the attachments to the lower jaw to any required extent. If the entire tongue is to be removed, Pig. 512.—Billroth's incision. (After Butlin.) Fig. 513.—Incision of Gant and Koclier. (After Butlin.)

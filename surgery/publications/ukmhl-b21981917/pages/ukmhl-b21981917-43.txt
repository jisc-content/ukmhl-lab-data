It should be relieved by temporary dis- contimiance of the ether, forcible separation of the Jaws by means of the screw-gag, or other instrument, pulling the tongue out of the mouth with Fig. 41.—^Modified from Esmarch.) a forceps or tenaculum (Fig. 41), and compression of the thorax by lay- ing the hands spread out upon the lower antero-lateral surface of the ribs and pushing inward until the lungs are emj^tied, then allowing the ribs to expand. A few repetitions of this manoeuvre will suffice, and the administration of the anaesthesia should be resumed. In the second stage, or that of complete nar- cosis, respiration is fre- quently interfered with by the tongue gravitat- ing backward upon the larynx. This can usual- ly be corrected by plac- ing the index-finger be- hind the angle of the jaw, and pressing this bone directly forward (Fig. 42). The hyoid bone, fastened to the chin by the genio-hyoid muscles, is thus pulled forward, and the tongiie is lifted from the larynx. If this does not succeed, the gag should be inserted, and the tongue held out by the tenacu- lum, forceps, or silk thread. Whenever mucus accumulates in the pharynx and mouth, it should Tig. 43. be mopped out by the sponges tied to curved holders (Fig. 43). These should be carried well back to the larynx, and along the sides of the tongue and buccal walls. In opera- tions about the mouth, or when in the stage of muscular spasm the Fio. 42.—(Esmarch.)

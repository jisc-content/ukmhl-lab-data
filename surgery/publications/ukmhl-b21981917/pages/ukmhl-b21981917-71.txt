57 INFLAMMATION. When ready to arrest the flow, place a pellet of absorbent cotton, moistened in 1 to 3,000 sublimate, over the wound, hold it firmly here, and then remove the ligature. A piece of sublimate gauze is now laid over the wound, and held in place by a moderately tight bandage. If leeches are to be employed, from six to a dozen or more should be applied directly to the inflamed area. If a drop of blood is drawn out by the prick of a needle, or warm milk dropped on, they will take hold more readily. Once attached, they should be allowed to drop off of their own accord. If the oozing from the wound is too prolonged, it can be arrested by a sublimate compress. Fig. 116.—Ten-bladed scarificator. Scarification is now rarely practiced, since freer incisions are to be preferred. When per- formed, it consists of making a series of small cuts into or through the inflamed integu- ment by means of a number of lancets, driven by a spring with almost painless rapidity (Fig. 116). FiQ. 115.—(Modified from Esmarch.) Compression applied to the main artery, going to the ]3art inflamed at a point removed from the zone of inflammation, is impracti- cable and of doubtful benefit. The constriction of the artery without also partly occluding the vein is scarcely possible except by digital compression, or the use of the pole-compress, shown in the treatment of aneurism. The local application of cold is of great benefit, and usually affords much comfort in the treatment of inflammation. One of the most useful and cleanly methods of applying it is to place crushed ice in the well-

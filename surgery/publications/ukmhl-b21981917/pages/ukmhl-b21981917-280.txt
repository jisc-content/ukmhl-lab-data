A TEXT-BOOK ON SURGERY. 266 of the femur will run over and parallel with the femoral. It may be secured in any part of its course. In Scarpa's Space.—The point of election for tying the siiperficial femoral is from four to five inches below Poupart's ligament, ^^^ith this as the center, make an incision three inches long on the line already indi- cated. Beneath the skin and fascia some superficial and unimportant vessels may be divided; the fibers of the sartorius will be seen in the lower portion of the wound, and should be drawn downward with a re- tractor. The saphenous nerve will next be seen on the outer side of the common sheath of the vessels. The sheath should next be incised, and the artery carefully isolated by inserting a dull director beneath and around it from the inner side. The ligature is passed the same way. f iQ. 303.—Ligation of the deep and superficial femoral near the bifurcation of the common femoral, and in the apex of Scarpa's triangle. In this same plane an incision may be made to expose the artery lower down, where it is completely hidden by the sartorius. This mus- cle may be drawn to the side most convenient to the operator (Figs. 302, 303). In Hunter's Canal.—Find the junction of the middle and lower thirds of the thigh. In the femoral line, with this point as the center, make an incision, about four inches in length, directly down to the sheath of the

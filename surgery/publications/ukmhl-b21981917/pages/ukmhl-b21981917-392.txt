A TEXT-BOOK OX SURGERY. 378 effused beneath it. An incision was made through this, and tlie track of the bullet through the pia mater was discovered. It had struck the inner surface of the calvaria, had rebounded with a downward deflection, and was found about half an inch from the hole made by the trephine. A small rubber drainage-tube was passed entirely" through the track made by the bullet, and left projecting at each opening. Irrigation through the tube was not attempted. The wounds were dressed with iodoform- ized gauze, loosely laid on, and an antiseptic dressing over this. The patient recovered and returned to his occupation, suffering only with a slight impairment of memory and occasional muscular spasm. The important lesson from this case is, that the careful exploration of the cranial cavity, and of the brain-substance, for the removal of a foreign body, is a rational and Justifiable surgical procedure. The careful em- ployment of a light, broad, dull-pointed probe will enable the operator, in a certain proportion of cases, to follow in the track of a foreign body and indicate its j)lace of lodgment. Not infrequently compression of the brain occurs from hjemorrhage between the skull and the dura mater, or from a collection of pus, exos- tosis, depression of bone, or tumor within the cranium. Within recent years researches in cerebral anatomy and physiology have enabled scien- tists to determine, with accuracy sufficient to justify the application of their conclusions to surgical practice, from the disturbance of function in certain portions of the economy, the region of the brain involved in the zone of compression. That portion of this subject which is most Fissure of Eolando. Fissure of Sylvius.

129 AMPUTATIONS. FiG. 194. acromion process, with the stump properly elevated, will be the most dependent portion of the wound. An extra tube may be inserted at the end of the stump. Second Method.—M.2i\e a circular cut down to the muscles, and a longitudinal incision to the same depth along the outer side of the arm. Dissect the sleeve of skin carefuUy up to the line of section of the humerus, and at this point divide the muscles and bone. Drainage as in the preceding, or as shown in Fig. 190. The anatomical relations in the several regions of the arm are shown in Figs. 191, 192, 193. When the line of amputation is so near the shoulder-joint that section of the bone is required at a point not more than two inches below the under surface of the acromion process of the scapula, the entire humerus should be removed by disarticulation. At the Shoulder- Joint—First Meth- od.—The patient should be placed so that the shoulder is near the corner of the table and con- venient to the oper- ator. After render- ing the extremity bloodless, apply the elastic tourniquet around the axilla and over the clavi- cle and spine of the scapula. Hold- ing the arm so that j the internal condyle points directly to the patient's side, enter a long, sharp scalpel directly down to the capsule of the joint, just at the articulation of the clavicle with the and expose the head and upper part of the humerus by a perpendicular incision, which splits the deltoid down to its insertion. At the lower end of this incision make a circular cut through the skin, and, allov^ng it to retract, divide at this line the remaining soft tissues down to the bone. In order to prevent any bleeding, in case the tourniqaet should not be sufficiently tight, an , assistant should be ready to grasp the flap just below the tourniquet, or press the subclavian against the first rib. The entire flap is now dis-

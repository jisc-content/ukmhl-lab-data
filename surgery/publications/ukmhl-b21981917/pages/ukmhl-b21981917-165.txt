AMPUTATIONS. 151 tissues is now constricted by a second elastic tube, or ligature, as close to the body as possible, and this intrusted to an assistant, whose hands also grasp that part of the flap in which the large vessels are located. At a point as low as possible, or about six inches from the trochanter, make a circular sweep around the thigh, dividing the skin, and allow this to retract. On this level the amputa- tion is to be completed by passing a long knife behind the bone, cutting squarely back through all the re- maining tissues (Fig. 239). As rap- idly as possible all the larger vessels are grasped with forceps, after which the ligatures are applied. The drain- age should be from the cavity of the acetabulum, out at the upper angle, and at each of the two lower angles of this stump. Second Method.—Six or seven inches below the trochanter make a circular incision through the skin and fascia, and allow this to retract. At the level of the retracted skin divide all the tissues down to the bone, and saw through the femur at this level, as in Dieffenbach's procedure. Fig. 240.—(After Esmarch.) Fig. 241 Secure all vessels at once, and disarticulate by the same incision as prac- ticed in the preceding operation.

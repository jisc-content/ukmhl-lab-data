443 THE TONGUE AND BUCCAL CAVITY. a habit which often induces a catarrhal condition of the mucous mem- brane lining the respiratory tract. The follicles of the tonsil discharge a dirty, cheesy secretion, which at times becomes retained in the gland and undergoes calcification. Calculi one fourth of an inch in diameter have been removed from this organ. Tonsillotomy. â€”Excision of the tonsils is an operation practically free from danger. In children who can not control themselves, chloroform should be used, the gag in- troduced, and the tongue depressed by an assistant. The operator seizes the exposed portion of the organ with a long mouse- tooth forceps or a tenaculum, pulls it slightly toward the median line, and with a long-handled pair of scis- sors, curved on the flat, clips off from one third to one half the tonsil. A sponge, fixed in a holder, dipped in ice-water and pressed on to the bleeding surface, will arrest the haemorrhage. In adults local angesthesia may be insured by cocaine hydrochlorate, and the operation performed as above, with much greater facility, since the intelligent co-operation of the patient is of great value. If the long scissors can not be had, a long, curved, probe-pointed bis- Tiemann & Co.'s tonsillotome, toury may be used instead. The tonsil is lift- ed from its bed by a tenaculum, and the knife carried through as above. Various tonsillotomes have been intro- duced, and for some cases are very useful, but for simplicity and general application the in- struments above selected will answer all pur- poses. Among the best of the tonsillotomes is that of Mackenzie (Fig. 514), and Tiemann's instrument (Fig. 515). The tonsil is also occasionally the seat of malignant neoplasms, as sarcoma and carcinoma, while cystic tumors, fibroma, and lymphoma are among the benign new formations which attack this gland. They re- quire early and thorough excision in all cases.

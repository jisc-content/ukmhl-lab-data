A TEXT-BOOK ON SURGERY. 60 where a chronic inflammatory process has occurred, is the granular cor- puscle, or, as it is more commonly called, the compound granular cor- puscle. The pus-corpuscles proper are leucocytes and dead embryonic tissue-cells. The compound granular corpuscles are made up of an aggregation of granules, the detritus of leuco- cytes, embryonic tissue, or other cells, which have undergone fatty or granular metamor- phosis. These adhere together in spherical or oval masses of all sizes, often as large as a dozen pus - cells together, or the granules may float free in the liquor puris. The differentiation of these elements is not difficult. Upon the ad- dition of acetic acid the pus-corpuscles become swollen, and lose their granular, cloudy ap- pearance, while their Fig. 119.—(Modified from Thomas.) a, Compound granular corpus- cles, j, Crystals of cholestcrin. c, Fus-cells. d.

Acetic acid does not afi'ect the granular corpuscle, which, however, is soluble in ether. Pus-cor- puscles proper are at times endowed vsdth the amoeboid movement. This is only true of the white bloodrcell, which has not yet perished. The dead embryonic cells do not possess the power of motion. These various elements of pus, as well as the cholesterin crystals, which are sometimes met with, are shown in Fig. 119. Fig. 120.—Micrococci and bacteria. (After Sternberg and Maarnin.) Pus-corpuscles and the liquor puris from all acute abscesses, whether communicating with the atmosphere or not, contain also certain micro- organisms known as micrococci and bacteria (Fig. 120). These organisms

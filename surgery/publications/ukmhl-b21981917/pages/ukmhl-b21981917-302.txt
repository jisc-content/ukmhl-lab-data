A TEXT-BOOK ON SURGERY. 288 The opposite end is passed to the front of the arm at the elbow, be- tween the first strip and the arm, and is then carried around the back. An assistant now carries the elbow backward and upward, and, while held in this position, the bandage is tied, sewed, or pinned. A sling to support the forearm is added. This is practically a figure-of-8 band- age around the elbow of the broken side and the shoulder of the sound side. The hand is carried across the chest, slightly elevated, and is held in a sling. Safety-pins are inserted at the points of crossing (Figs. 316, 317). In incomplete fracture, and in children, especially during the summer months, when the plaster tends to produce irritation of the skin, Vel- peau's method is preferable. (See page 321.) Any form of apparatus should be worn at least four weeks. The scapula is almost always broken by direct violence. It is thought to have been fractured in a few instances by muscular action alone. Acromion Process.—The acromion process is usually broken hj a fall on the shoulder or a blow received from above. The fracture may occur anterior to, through, or behind the acromio-clavicular articulation. The diagnosis is evident from crepitus, preternatural mobility, and de- pression of the outer end of the clavicle. The treatment is to bend the forearm at a right angle to the arm, and throw a roller under the foreann, at the elbow, and over the clavicle and shoulder of the affected side, fix- ing the head of the humerus in the upper part of the shoulder-Joint and lifting the acromion into its place. Coracoid Process.—When this process is broken the tendency to dis- placement is downward, owing to the action of the pectoralis minor, coraco-brachialis, and short head of the biceps. Unless the fracture is Fig. 316.—Moore's method. Fig. 317.—Moore's method. 1

AMPUTATIONS. 113 perpendicular to the axis of the limb. The periosteum should next be cut through in the circumference of the bone where the saw is to enter. Second Method—Modified Circular.—The foregoing method should always be modified by a perpendicular incision through to the muscles, since this not only renders the dissection more rapid, but does away with the unnecessary bruising to which the unsplit cuff is subjected as it is rolled upon itself. Third Method—Oml.—It not infrequently occurs that the condition of the soft parts near the line of amputation will not permit of an incision directly around the limb without a too great sacrifice of the member. Under such circumstances, an oval or elliptical incision may be made, and in this way integument enough secured to cover in the stump. The longitudinal slit may be added to this operation. Fourth Method—Double Crescentic.—The circular operation maybe further modified by making two crescentic skin-flaps of equal size, the bases of these being at the line of section of muscle and bone. The same precautions as given above are necessary to secure enough integument to form a hood for the stump (Fig. 162). 8

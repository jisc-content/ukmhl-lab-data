5 SURGICAL DRESSINGS. its corrosive action. Wlien an operation or dressing is completed, after, the sublimate escapes, pure water should be run through the irrigator. A good emergency irrigator is shown in Fig. 6. It is made by placing a perforated cork in an ordinary wine-bottle, fitting a piece of glass tube, or cane, or goose-quill into the perforation to which the rubber hose is at- tached. The bottom of the bottle is broken Fig. 6.—(Esmarch.) Fig. 5. in, and a string netting, thrown around for suspension, completes the apparatus. If there is no stop-spring to shut oS the flow, it may be readily arrested by placing the nozzle in the upper end of the bottle. The assistant who attends to the irrigator can always regu- late the flow by slight pressure of the tube between the thumb and finger, just where the nozzle is attached. Tin or brass vessels may also be em- ployed, but the corrosive action of the mercury soon destroys the metal. When no irrigator can be had, the sublimate solution may be poured on from a pitcher or cup. For continuous irrigation, as in an amputation treated by the open method, a constant dripping may be secured by twisting a piece of muslin or cotton cloth into a loose wick-like string, moistening it, and placing one end in a vessel holding the solution, while the other hangs over the edge from a point where the fluid will fall on the wounded surface (Fig. 7). Sponges.—In selecting sponges, secure those of softest and finest text- ure, measuring, when dry, from one to two and three inches in diameter, the greater number spherical in shape, with a half-dozen flat pieces a half-inch thick, three or four inches wide, and from six to ten inches long. When purchased in the rough they should be thoroughly whipped until all the sand is removed, and then washed in cold or lukewarm

In suppression of urine all of these symptoms are absent, the skin is usually hot and dry, the pulse rapid and full, and the temperature is several degrees above the normal. The introduction of a catheter or puncture of the bladder with a small-sized aspirator-needle, just at the upper level of the symphysis, will determine the diagnosis. Fig. 569.—Filiform catheter. In treatment, the evacuation of the contents of the organ is the im- mediate indication. The patient should be put to bed and given the benefit of a full dose of opium. This agent is useful in alleviating pain, in securing relaxation of the muscular elements of the urethra and pros- tate, and-—by producing diaphoresis—in diverting fluids from the kidneys to the excretory appara- tus of the skin. A soft- rubber (Nelaton) cathe- ter should be preferred; but, if this can not be introduced, a firmer, olive-pointed instrument (Fig. 571) should be em- ployed. The silk-woven and gummed catheter (Figs. 572 and 573) is also a useful instrument, and if, on account of its elas- ticity, it can not be introduced, the stylet of Prof. Keyes (Fig. 574) should be inserted into the ca theter to give it the required stiffness.

It should be of heavy silver, strong, perfectly smooth, and should have a curve corresponding to that of the normal urethra. In size it should cor- respond to No. 10,12, or 14, U. S., and the larger sizes should be preferred.

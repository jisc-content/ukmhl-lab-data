33 ANESTHESIA. the inhaler falls over the mouth and nose. The administration is begun by pouring twelve or fifteen drops of the anaesthetic upon the inhaler or napkin. A free admixture of air is necessary. The napkin should not be held in contact with the lips or nose, for fear of shutting off the proper quantity of air, and also because of the ii'ritating effect of chloroform upon the skin. In two or three minutes the same quantity is renewed, and so on until sensibility and consciousness are lost. Chloroform nar- cosis may also be divided into three stages. The first is the stage of excitation. In this the pulse is usually in- creased in force and frequency, the face is flushed, the pupil normal or contracted; delirium is present, and a condition of muscular rigidity ensues, varying in degree in different subjects. It is almost always well marked in patients of the alcohol habit. The second stage is that in which sensibility and consciousness are lost, yet in which the functions of the heart and respiratory organs are performed in an almost natural manner. The pupil is now dilated and arterial tension diminished. In the tJiird stage, that of profound paralysis, the breathing becomes shallow and stertorous, the heart-beats rapid and weak, and the arterial tension is markedly diminished. The second is the operatipe stage. The third, should be avoided. Death during the inhalation of chloroform occurs from both heart and respiratory failure, and may take place in any stage of the narcosis. 3

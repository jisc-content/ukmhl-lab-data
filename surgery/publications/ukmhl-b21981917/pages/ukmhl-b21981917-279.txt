LIGATION OF ARTERIES. 265 The deep circumflex and the epigastric branches, which arise about half an inch above the ligament, may also be tied by this incision. In its upper portion this vessel may be secured by the same operation as for the common iliac. Ligation of the Femoral Artery—Anatomy.—At Poupart's ligament the vein is on the same plane as the artery, and immediately internal to it. One quarter of an inch to the outer side, and deeper than the artery, lies the anterior crural nerve. One inch and a half from the ligament the profunda femoris arises from the outer aspect of the common trunk, and from one to two inches lower passes behind the superficial femoral. Four inches from Poupart's ligament the relations have changed to such Fig. 302.—Ligation of the supei-flcial tbmoral iu Scarpa's space. an extent that the femoral vein is deeper and slightly behind the artery. The long saphenous nerve lies upon the sheath of the artery, in its middle third, and occasionally sends a branch through Hunter''s canal. The sartorius muscle covers the femoral artery in all of its course except the first four inches, where it is superficial. Operation.—A line from a point half way between the symphysis pubis and the anterior superior spine of the ilium to the internal condyle

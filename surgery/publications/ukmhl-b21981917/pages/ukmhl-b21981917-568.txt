554 A TEXT-BOOK ON SURGERY. In capillary JicemorrJioids the chief symptom is haemorrhage. The bleeding occurs with and after each stool, or may follow violent exercise or straining. If the finger is carried into the bowel, no tumors are felt, and there is usually no tenesmus. If the speculum is employed, the mucous membrane will be seen to be studded with bleeding points or tufts projecting a slight distance from the normal level of the lining membrane of the rectum. They are red, not unlike small raspberries in appearance, and bleed profusely at the slightest provocation. They are really new formations or chronic granulation-tissue, rich in capillary loops. The treatment consists in dilatation of the anus and rectum with the speculum, and in touching the bleeding points with the Paquelin cau- tery until all bleeding ceases. If the cautery is not at hand, pure nitric acid should be applied.

The pin-suture is still popular with a number of surgeons. Silver pins, or the ordinary iron pin of commerce, may be employed, and the adjustment of the opposing surfaces made more complete by throwing a silk or catgut interrupted loop, or figure-of-8, around the ends of the pin (Fig. 141), or a continuous figure-of-8 applied, as shown in Figs. 142 and 143. Fig. 141. Fig. 145. When it becomes necessary to close a three-cornered wound, a cross- suture (Fig. 144) may be utilized, or the double-needled suture (Fig. 145) may be substituted. Superficial lesions may be closed by adhesive strips, although this method is less exact and less cleanly than the sutures.

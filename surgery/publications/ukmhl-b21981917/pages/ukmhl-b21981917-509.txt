INGUINAL HERNIA. ^95 the spermatic cord along the inguinal canal, at times descending into the tunica vaginalis testis. In the female the descent is in the canal of Nuck, following the round ligament into the inguinal canal, and at times as far as the labium. Tlie epigastric vessels are internal to the necTc, and behind the body of an oblique inguinal hernia (Figs. 534 and 546). Fia. 535.â€”Showing, at 1 and 2, openings at which oblique and direct hernise escape, and their relations to the deep epigastric artery. (Modified from Maclise.) A direct hernia does not enter the internal abdominal ring, but pushes the fascia, which is to the inner side of the epigastric vessels and imme- diately behind the external ring, directly in front of the tumor and out at the external ring. The epigastric mssels are external to the necJc, and may be displaced slightly in front and to the outer side of a direct inguinal hernia (Figs. 535 and 546). An inguinal hernia is said to be complete when the contents protrude beyond the external ring; incomplete, when the tumor is within this limit. A complete inguinal hernia in the male may descend into the cavity of the tunica vaginalis testis, the contents resting in contact with the

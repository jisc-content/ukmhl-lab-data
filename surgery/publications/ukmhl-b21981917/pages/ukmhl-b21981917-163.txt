AMPUTATIONS. 149 Second MetJiod.—Make a circular incision tlirough the skin and fascia, Joined by a perpendicular cut on the lower external aspect of the limb. Dissect up the flap from the muscles, and divide all the remaining soft tissues squarely at the point of section of the bone. Suture the flap, and drain from the outer upper (and, if necessary, lower) angle. Fig. 238.—Section through the right femur at the condyles and at the middle of the patella. Looking at the central surface as exposed after amputation at this point. 1, Popliteal artery, vein, and internal popliteal nerve. 2, External popliteal or peroneal nerve. The capsule and the synovial cavities are admirably shown, as well as the bursa mucosa patelloe. At the Hip.—When possible, the first method just given should be employed here, for the reason that it allows the division of the arteries at the greatest possible distance from the trunk. Proceed as follows: Place the patient so that the hip at which the operation is to be per- formed projects well over the corner of the table. The member to be amputated is emptied of blood by elevation and the Esmarch bandage, and is held by an assistant while the opposite thigh is abducted and allowed to drop over the end of the table, the foot resting upon a stool. Haemorrhage may in great part be controlled by placing a compress upon the iliac, as it runs along the rim of the pelvis, and holding this down

An abdominal tourniquet should be applied, so as to com- press the aorta at a point one inch to the left of the umbilicus. This need not be tightened unless compression below proves iuadequate."^ Operation.—Half way between the anterior-superior spine of the ilium and the upper surface of the trochanter major (the extremity being held parallel with the axis of the body, and the foot normally everted) intro- duce a strong scalpel straight dovm to the bone, and by a single incision divide all the tissues along the head and neck, over the middle of the great trochanter, and down the outer aspect of the femur for three or four inches, and as much as six if possible, below the tip of the trochanter. Arrest the bleeding as the operation proceeds. Dissect the tendons Fio. 239.—(Modified from Esmarch.) from their insertion into and near the trochanter, using the cutting edge of the knife only when necessary, preference being given to lifting the soft parts from the periosteum and capsule with the dry dissector. With strong hook retractors the edges of the wound are separated, the joint exposed, the capsule and ligamentum teres divided, and disarticulation effected. The soft parts are now still farther lifted from the bone, to a point at least six inches below the trochanter. The entire mass of soft * If no other means is at hanrl, the iliac may be compressed by introducing a padded staff into the rectum, and over this vessel as it runs along the pelvic rim. Trendelenburg recommended transfixion by means of a round steel pin, which is passed between the head of the femur and the femoral vessels. Compression is maintained by the elastic bandage, thrown over the end in figure-of-8 fashion.

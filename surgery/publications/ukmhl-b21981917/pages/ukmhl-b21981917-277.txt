LIGATION OF ARTERIES. 263 ment to tlie abdominal wall and iliac fossa, along the iUac artery. When the bifurcation is reached, draw firmly with a retractor upon the upper lip of the wound and pass the needle from the inner side.* This opera- tion may be demanded in sciatic or gluteal aneurism, or haemorrhage from these vessels. The former method is preferable. The Gluteal Artery.—Make a five-inch incision, on a line extending from the spine of the last lumbar vertebra to the trochanter major. The center of this line will indicate the point at which the artery emerges. Separate with a dull instrument the fibers of the gluteus maxim us, dis- place anteriorly the gluteus medius, and find the groove between the minimus and the pyriformis. Follow this groove upward to the bony edge of the notch, and the artery and veins will be found (Fig. 299, upper incision). Fig. 300.—Ligation of the internal pudic in the perinseum. Tlie Sciatic.—Make an incision, five inches long, on a line from the midfle of the sacral spines to the trochanter major. Separate the fibers of the gluteus maximus and find the lower border of the pyriformis. The * The internal iliac has been tied about thirty times, with a death-rate of 66 per cent.

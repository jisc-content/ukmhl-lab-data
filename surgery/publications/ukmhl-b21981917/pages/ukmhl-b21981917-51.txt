SURGICAL OPERATIONS. 37 palatine ganglion, etc., the adjustable key-hole saws (Fig. 6.5) are needed. There are three blades, which can be attached by a screw-catd*- to a single handle. Chisels are of two kindsâ€”those to be |^ driven by a mal- let or hammer, and hand-chisels, for cutting curved. Fig. 66 G.TIEMANN & eO. Fig. fi6. G. TIEMANN & CO Fig. 68. Fig. 69. or gouging. They are straight-edged and is a half-size picture of Macewen's osteotome. Two of these will be required, and should measure, respective- ly, one half and three eighths of an inch in width at the cutting edge. A conven- lent hammer for driving the chisel through is seen in Fig. 67. Volkmann's sharp spoons or scoojys (Fig. 68) are invaluable in certain operations. The scalloped gouges (Fig. 69) are to be used with the hand without the mallet. Sayre's periosteal ele- vator (Fig. 70) meets al- most every requirement for lifting the periosteum, and is, besides, an excel- lent bone-elevator. For lifting the periosteum from the palate-bones, the three instruments of Goodwil- lie are very useful (Fig. 71). Bone-drills are not as often used now as in for- mer years, yet they may be needed occasionally. One or two are burred with as many plain-edged cutting drills (Fig. 72). For purposes of econ- omy in space, a single adjustable handle is arranged for all the drills. Bone - forceps should be constructed for cutting, holding, and extracting uses. Fig. T2.

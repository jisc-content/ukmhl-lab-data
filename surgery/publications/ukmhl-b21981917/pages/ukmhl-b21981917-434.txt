Sliding a flap from the neck is shown in Fig. 497, where the flap, bad, is brought up to fill the oval space left by removal of the diseased Fig. 496.—(After Eoser.)

Or an elastic ligature may be introduced through the cheek at the required distance from the angle, brought out at the corner of the mouth, and tied.

It is a wise precaution to make a guarded prognosis, for, no matter how successful from the surgical standpoint, the operations do not, in the majority of instances, secure the expected improvement in the personal appearance of the patient. Paeotid Gtland and Duct. Salivary fistula may be confined to the main parotid duct in any part of its course, or to the primary ducts within the substance of the gland. It may result from a wound or any inflammatory and necrotic process due to obstruction from salivary calculi or other disease of the parotid and buccal regions. Exploration of the duct with a delicate blunt iDrobe is accomplished thus: Find the outlet at the papilla on the mucous membrane of the buccal cavity near the junction of the second bicuspid

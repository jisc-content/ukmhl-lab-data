287 FRACTURES. about three inches wide and several feet in length. Just above the el- bow of the arm on the injured side, one strip, with the adhesive surface nearest the body, is passed around the arm and secured with a safety-pin, so that it will not constrict the member (Fig. 313). The hand is now laid Fia. 313.—The first strip. Fig. 314.—Sayre's dressing for fractured clavicle.

The second strip is split near its middle for about three inches, for the accommodation of the elbow, and is applied along the fore- arm and over the shoulder of the sound side, and obliquely around the back to the same point (Figs. 314, 315). A wad of absorbent cotton should be placed in the axilla of the affected side, and between the hand and the sternum. The plasters should be stitched or fastened securely with safety-pins. A convenient and effective ready- method is that of Prof. Moore, of Rochester. A strip of sheeting, eight inches in width and three yards long, is held near its center across the palm of the operator, who, for the left clavicle, grasps the elbow of this side from behind. That end of the strip which is next the patient's body is passed between the arm and chest, then up in front of and over the clav- icle of the injured side, obliquely across the back, under the opposite axilla, thence across the right clavicle, and over this to the back.

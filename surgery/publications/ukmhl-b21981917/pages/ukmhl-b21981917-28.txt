When the projection caused by the tendon of the pectoralis major is reached, the roller is carried from the inner side by the front, over the point of the shoulder, around the back, and underneath the opposite arm, across the chest to the anterior and outer surface of the humerus, then under- neath the arm, making a figure-of-8 turn, one loop of which surrounds the arm, and the other the thorax. These turns are continued, gradually ascending until the root of the neck is reached. It is best to fill the ax- illa of both arms with absorbent cotton to prevent chafing, when this dressing is to be worn for any length of time. TJie Toes, Foot, Leg, and TMgJi.—The great toe may be bandaged by carrying a narrow roller spirally around it, from the tip to the meta- tarso-phalangeal Joint, and thence by a figure-of-8 around the ankle. This last turn should be sev- eral times repeated, in or- der to hold the dressing firmly. It is customary to include all of the toes in the general foot-bandage. To bandage the foot, begin by placing bits of absorbent cotton between the toes. Take a roller from two to two and a half inches wide, and about ten yards long. Lay the end of the bandage parallel with the axis of the leg, half-way between the two malleoli in front, and carry the roller by the inner side to the heel, so that the middle of the bandage will be over the center of the Fig. 18.—The author's foot-bandacre with a sins'le roller.

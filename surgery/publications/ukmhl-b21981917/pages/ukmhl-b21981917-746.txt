The yielding of these muscles may be due to paralysis, or to strain from the habit of carrying heavy weights. Fig. 729.—Congenital talipes valgus. Fig. 730.—Acquired talipes valgus.

Treatment.—In talipes val- gus in an infant the eversion may be corrected by means of the adhesive strips applied as in the treatment of varus. The direction of traction is of course opposite. The artificial muscles, after the method of Barwell, are also as applicable here as in varus. The iron shoe (Fig. 725), made with the bar to come upon the inner side of the leg, is as service- able in mild cases of valgus as in varus or equino-varus. This apparatus is always worn in- side of an ordinary shoe. Ny- rop's boot (Fig. 733) is highly recommended by Mr. Reeves. It consists of a stiff-soled lacing- shoe, with a leg-collar and iron or steel bar attached to the outer side of the shoe, with a lateral hinge opposite the out- er malleolus. To the inner side of the sole, near the heel, is attached a strong piece of elastic webbing, by which inversion of the foot is effected by buckling the strap to the collar near the knee.

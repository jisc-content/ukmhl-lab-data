A TEXT-HOOK ON SURGERY. 384 tance from the free margin of the lid, should not be wounded when it is possible to avoid it. When the dissection is completed, a tongue of skin may be slid from the malar re- gion across the Avound. Fig. 416 represents the space left after the removal of a myxo- sarcoma of the face, and Fig. 417 the method of covering in the deficiency. From the outer angles parallel incisions were continued through the skin toward the ear. as far as was necessary to secure integument enough to slide across the gap. The transverse facial artery, which runs about one fourth of an inch below and parallel with the zygoma, should be kept in the flap, which is dis- sected up until the end near- est the nose can be carried across to the edge of the wound upon the nose and stitched at this point. The lower border is next fastened, and after this the upper margin of the tongue of Fig. 418. the palpebral border is stitched skin with the finest suture ma- terial. The sutures may be re- moved in from two to four days. It is necessary to arrest all bleeding from the bottom of the cavity left after a dissec- tion ; that from the edges will be arrested by the sutures. The tension on the flap should not be so great that the blood- supply is seriously interfered vsdth. After the first sutures are inserted it will be well to wait for a few minutes in order to see that the circulation is established. Figs. 418 and 419 are taken from a patient from whom a large nsevus was ex- cised, and the wound filled by free dissection and sliding of the integument of the cheek. Little or no eversion or drag- to Fio. 419.

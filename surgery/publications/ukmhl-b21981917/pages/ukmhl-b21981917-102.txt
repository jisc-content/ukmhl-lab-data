The diminution of the momentum, and the tumbling of the projectUe as it plunges through the tissues, together with the non-resistance of the skin at the exit, "will account for the larger size of this opening. When a projectile pass- es completely through the tissues there is usually a single opening of exit. Occasionally the object is divided after entrance, and makes two or more holes of exit, or one part of the bullet may lodge and the other pass out. ¥iG. 149.—Table of weights (in grains) of the balls at present in use in the armies of various nations. With the exception of No. 6, the cuts approximate the actual size of the missiles. 1, Springfield rifle, 500 grains (Agnew). 2, Enfield rifle, 530 grains (Agnew). 3, Austrian rifle (old), 400 jjrains (Agnew). 4, Chassepot rifle, 387X grains (Fischer). 5, Needle-gun, 530 grains (Agnew). 6, Slitrailleuse, 840 frains (Agnew). 7, Bavarian rifle, 386 grains (Fischer). 8, Snider rifle, about 400 frrains. 9, Musket- all, 480 grains (Agnew). 10, Belgian rifle, 385 grains (Fischer). 11, Martini-Henry rifle, 485 grains (Fischer)." 12, Italian rifle, 310 grains (Fischer). 13, Netherland rifle, 337 grains (Fischer). 14, Austrian rifle (new), 372 grains (Fischer). 15, Eussian rifle, 372 grains (Fischer). 16, Swiss rifle, 310 grains (^Fischer). Fragments of bone or teeth displaced by a missile may be driven out through the integument. If the velocity of a missile is great, and the tissues traversed offer no special resistance, the wound of exit will be in the direct line of that of entrance. Bodies traveling with diminished velocity or meeting with formidable resistance will be deflected, and may pursue a most unex- pected course. Instances are recorded of bullets which have made a half or the entire circuit of the body, passing just beneath the skin. Still more remarkable are the instances of extensive fracture of bones which have been produced without any evidence of injury to the integument.

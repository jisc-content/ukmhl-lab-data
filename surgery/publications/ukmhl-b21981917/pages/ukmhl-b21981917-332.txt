A TEXT-BOOK ON SURGERY. 318 administration of tonics, cod-liver oi], with the hypophosphites of lime and soda, should play an important part. It is of importance to fix the broken part immovably by the plaster- of-Paris or other solid dressing. This should be removed after four weeks, in order to allow passive motion of any articulation near the seat of fracture, and necessarily included in the dressing. After the first movement of the joint the dressing should be reapplied and the passive motion repeated each week. Great care should be observed to prevent motion at the seat of fracture. If, after the lapse of from ten to fourteen weeks, there are no indications of union, a mild inflammation should be induced in the tissues immediately about the fracture. This may be accomplished by forcibly rubbing the ends of the bones together (after an anaesthetic has been administered), and then investing the member with the gypsum dressing. In obstinate cases more radical measures may need to be adopted. A favorite practice is to cut down upon the fracture, dissect away any new-formed tissue, and saw off the ends of the bones, back far enough to reach healthy and w^ell-nourished bone. It may sometimes suffice to cause inflammation and stimulate bone- formation by puncturing the skin with an awl or drill, and with the point of this instrument scraping the ends of the fragments. If these measures fail, the bones should be freshened and brought together by silver-wire sutures, as advised in fracture of the jaw, or by transfixion with movable steel drills, in the same manner as given in excision of the knee-joint.

A TEXT-BOOK ON SURGERY. 238 should be passed around the artery, from the outer toward the inner side. In the "Prize Essay" of the American Medical Association for 1878 I collected histories of 789 cases in which the common carotid artery had been tied for all causes, of which 323, or 41 per cent, died. An analysis of these cases is impossible here. I do not believe that the death-rate will ever again reach this alarming figure. The introduction of animal ligatures and antisepsis have already greatly diminished the death-rate in operations upon the arteries. Fig. 283.—Horizontal section at the level of the seventh cervical vertebra. 1, 1, The right and left com- mon carotid arteries and the internal ju'jjular veins. 2, The right and left vertebral arteries and veins. Directly between the vertebral and carotid arteries is seen the sympathetic nerve and the inferior thyroid artery and some of its branches. The pneumogastric nerves are seen between and slightly posterior to the internal jugular veins and the common carotids. 3, Trachea. 4, ffisophagus. 5, Transversalis colli artery and veins and descending branches of the subclavian artery. 6, Cords or brachial plexus. 7, 7, External jugular vein. (After Braune.) Thirty-four cases are on record in which both trunks were tied, of which twenty-five recovered.* Ligation of the Internal Carotid Artery—Anatomy.—This vessel is a direct continuation of the common trunk, and, while straight in its lower portion, it becomes slightly tortuous as it approaches the carotid canal. An abnormal branch was found to be derived from its first portion in seven of one hundred and twenty dissections. Operation.—The position is the same as for tying the common trunk. * Op. eit.

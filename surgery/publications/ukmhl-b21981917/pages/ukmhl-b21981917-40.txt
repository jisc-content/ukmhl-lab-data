26 A TEXT-BOOK ON SURGERY. Fig. 37.—Mott-Heister speculum or\a. 2. A Goodwillie's mouth-gag (Figs. 35 and 36) for keeping the Jaws permanently separated if the emergency arises. The Mott-Heister gag will do as a substitute (Fig. 37). 3. A strong tenaculum, or forceps, for drawing out the tongue. 4. A large-sized curved nee- dle, armed with a good silk thread, for transfixion of the tongue if the emergency arises. 5. Two or three curved pro- bangs with small sponges tied on, for mopping out the pharynx, throat, and mouth (see Fig. 43). 6. Several ounces of whisky or brandy undiluted ; a hypodermic syringe filled with this and ready for use ; an ordinary syringe for a whisky or warm-water enema. 7. An extra can of ether. 8. A silver trachea-tube. 9. A pus-basin or pan, in case of vomiting. 10. When an operation which may involve great loss of blood is un- dertaken, a ten-ounce saline solution for transfusion. The formula is: Common salt, gr. xxx; carbonate of soda, gr. v; water, 3 x. If necessary, the ether may be poured directly from the can into the inhaler, but the bottle shown in Fig. 38 will be foiind very convenient, and, as it is graduated, the quantity used can be readily estimated. As to the form of inhaler, I pre- fer that of AUis (Fig. 39): " The apparatus consists of a wire frame-work sufiiciently large to cover the lower part of the face. The wires are parallel, and about an eighth of an inch apart. Between the wires, from side to side, a strip of bandage two and one lialf inches wide is Fig. 38. Fig. 39.—The Allis inlialer.

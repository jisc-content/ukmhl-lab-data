DISLOCATIONS. 333 in the new position. The shortening is from one to two inches, and in the vast majority of cases the great toe of the injured side is directed to or rests upon the instep of the opposite foot, while the knee of the lux- ated side is in front of, and slightly above, its fellow (Fig. 367). Muscu- lar rigidity and fixation are extreme. In very exceptional cases there is eversion of the foot, with slight abduction, which Prof. Bigelow holds to be due to extensive and unusual laceration of the ilio-femoral ligament. When the head of the bone is lodged in the iscMatic notch, the gen- eral characters of the deformity are the same, yet not so well marked. The degrees of flexion and adduction are less extreme, the trochanter is less prominent, and there is not so much shortening. ^^^^^ Fig. 368.—Position of extremity in dislocation of Fio. 369.—Position of extremity in dislocation of the the head of the femur into tlie thyroid foramen. head of the femur upon the pubes. (After Ham- (After Hamilton.) ilton.) extremity is increased in length, and the thigh is abducted and slightly flexed upon the abdomen. The toes may be turned slightly in or out, although they usually point to the front. The hip is less prominent than normal. The head of the femur may at times be recognized in the new position, although, on account of the tense condition of the adductor muscles, this is in some instances impossible (Fig. 368).

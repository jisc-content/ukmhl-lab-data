40 A TEXT-BOOK ON SURGERY. Esmarch's elastic bandage (Fig. 81) has superseded all other tourni- quets for operations upon the extremities. The rubber clamp usually sold with the bandage is, however, use- ^^-'^^^rZ'^': ^ less. Each operating-case should be - =^ provided with two bandages of strong elastic material (I prefer plain white rubber, which can be kept cleaner than the webbing) about two inches wide, and each bandage about four yards iil'l 1 long. The elastic ligature is a cord of plain ยง rubber about two feet long, and of dif- lilii!!^^ ferent sizes, varying from one twelfth Fig. 81. to oue fifth of an inch in diameter. HcBmostatic forceps should be of various shapes. The four varieties which I employ are illustrated in Fig. 82. A general operating-case should contain a total of at least six- teen forceps, and in the proportion of two fenestrated mouse-tooth, six broad, solid-jawed, four slender-jawed, and four scissor - clamps ; the first three have sliding catches, while the clamp has a spring-catch near the end of the handles. The mouse-tooth fenes- trated forceps is for ac- curate adaptation to su- perficial vessels of small size, while the broad- jawed instrument is for grasping either large vessels or masses of bleeding tissue. The points should be club- shaped and perfectly smooth, so that when the ligature is tightened Fig. 82, upon the instrument it will slide over its tip and on to the vessel. These pieces are five inches long and three eighths of an inch across the widest portions of the jaws. The sharp-i3ointed forceps are useful in picking up a vessel which has retracted or is deeply situated in a wound. The scissor-clamps may be used for applying the double ligatures in a dry dissection, or for temporary hsemostasis of smaller bleeding points which need to be compressed for a few minutes, and then remain permanently occluded. In operations in the various cavities, and in deep external wounds, as

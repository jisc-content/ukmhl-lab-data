10 A TEXT-BOOK ON SURGERY. lows : Take a cigar-box, remove the top and one end, bore a hole in each side-piece near the open end, and through these pass a piece of telegraph- wire bent in the shape of a windlass and crank. Wires may be run through at other points to serve the same purpose as the four rods in the other machine. In making plaster-of-Paris bandages, these same machines may be em- ployed, but the crinoline must be loosely rolled, and the powdered plaster worked in with the hands so well and thoroughly that the meshes of the cloth can not be seen. Considerable experience is required to prepare a good plaster bandage, and a poor one will spoil a dressing. Plaster band- ages should be made from fresh gypsum on the day they are to be ap- plied. Cotton and flannel bandages should be kept in a chest or closet away from dust and moisture. Methods of applying Bandages.â€”The various portions of the body may be bandaged by the simple spiral, reverse spiral, simple figure-of-8, and the figure-of-8 reverse. The simple spiral turn is most useful in bandaging those parts of the body where there is no sudden increase in the diameter and volume of the part. It is impracticable under other circumstances. Hold the bandage in the hand most convenient, with the back of the roller toward the limb (see Fig. 12); with the unoccupied hand take the free end of the bandage, lay and hold it upon the inner border of the limb, and carry the turn by the front - to the outer side of the part to be bandaged. Having carried the roller twice around the part to secure it, ascend the limb spirally, leaving about one thii'd of each turn uncovered by the last.

(Hamilton.) moved outward and slightly rotated in the same dii-ection, until re- sistance is again en- countered, Avhen it must be brought downward again to the bed." The older method of violent extension, by means of blocks and pulleys, should not be employed, unless all other means have failed. Reduction of Dis- locations into the Is- chiatic Notch.—In this luxation the mechan- ism of reduction is i:)rac- tically the same as for the preceding disj)lace- ment. One point must be guarded against — the danger that, when the head of the femur reaches the margin of the acetabulum, it may be deflected below the rent in the capsule, and lodge in the thyroid foramen. If extension and counter-extension after the older method (Astley Cooper's) be necessitated, the pelvis should be fixed by a sheet folded and passed through the peri- nseum and over the groin, and extension made from above the knee, with the thigh flexed al- most to an angle of 90° with the abdomen, and adducted un- til the knee is carried in front of the opposite thigh (Fig. 374). Reduction of Dislocations in the Thyroid Foramen—Method of Bigelow.—Place the patient upon the floor, in the dorsal de- cubitus, flex the leg on the thigh, and the thigh on the abdomen, making, at the same time, slight abduction. Then rotate the fe- mur inward, adduct, and carry the knee to the floor. The older method involved extension in a lateral direction, „ ■<> a >■ a- ^ ■ .v »i •.

413 THE LIPS AND CHEEKS. Second Method—Operation of Malgaigne.—With a sharp bistoury pare the edges of the fissure, by cutting a strip on each side, from the apex down to about one eighth of an inch from the free border of the lip. Fig. 4G5.—(After Malgaigne.) Fig. 466.—(After Malgaigne.) The strips are turned down, as shown in Fig. 465, and, after the lip on each side is dissected up from the bone, the edges are approximated and united, as shown in Fig. 466. The projecting portion is treated as in the preceding operation. Third Method—Operation of Langenbeck.—Upon one side of the fissure, as at ~b (Fig. 467), remove a narrow strip from the apex out through Fig. 467.—^After Linhart, Langenbeck.) Fig. 468.—(After Linhart.) the vermilion border. On the opposite side, a, the incision extends only to within one eighth to one fourth of an inch of the free border. After the lip is freed from all attachments, the edges are approximated and fastened, as shown in Fig. 468. Fourth Method—Operation of Nelaton.—Make an incision parallel Fig. 469.—(After Nelaton, Koenig.) Fig. 470.—(After Koenig.)

337 DISLOCATIONS. Fig. 376.—Showing the relation of the ilio-femoral ligament in dislocation of the head of the fe- mur into the thyroid foramen. (Bigelow.) pulleys can not be had, the sheet should be tied into a loop and laid over the shoulder of the operator. Reduction of Dislo- cations upon the Pubes —Hamilton's Method. — When the head of the bone is lodged well over the pelvic rim the thigh should be abducted and rotated outward, in order that the head may be thus lifted over the pu- bes, and then flexed upon the body, adducted, and brought down. Rotation outward should cease as soon as the head of the bone has risen above the pubes. When the head has not passed above the rim of the pubes, out- ward rotation is not called for. Fig. 377.—Showing how flexion of the thigh on the abdomen relaxes the ilio femoral ligament in dislocation into the thyroid foramen. (Bigelow.) passed around the inner surface of the thigh, while the pelvis was fixed by a sheet passed around this part of the body, and upon which traction was employed in an opposite direction (Fig. 378). If which is carried around the thigh Fig. 378.—Cooper's method of reducing dislocation into the thy- roid foramen. (Hamilton.) 22

DISLOCATIONS. 335 Fig. 371. -The ilio-fcmoral or Y ligament. (Bigelow.) Fig. 372.—Relaxation of the ilio-femoral ligament by flexion and adduction of thigh. (Bigelow.) Crosby^s Method.'''—Place the pa- tient on the floor, in the dorsal decu- bitus. Flex both legs on the thigh, and the thighs on the abdomen, and, with the arms locked underneath the knees, raise the patient from the floor so that the body will rest only on the neck and shoulders. If, after suspension lasting two or three minutes, reduction is not accom- plished, the patient should be swayed from side to side, thus adding alternately slight abduc- tion and adduction to the exten- sion. While the displacement may be overcome without anaesthesia, it is much more easily and surely effected with it. The same result may be accom- plished by employing vertical ex- tension in the manner recommend- ed by Bigelow and shown in Fig. 378. Hamilton's Method.—The pa- tient is in the dorsal decubitus, and the limb is grasped as in Bige- low's method. " Flexing the leg on the thigh, the knee is to be carefully lifted toward the face of the patient, until it meets with ^ , ^. ^., xio. 373.—Keduction ot dislooation on the dorsum ilu some resistance ; it must then be by vertical extension. (Blgelow.) * This method was introduced by the late Prof. A. B. Crosby.

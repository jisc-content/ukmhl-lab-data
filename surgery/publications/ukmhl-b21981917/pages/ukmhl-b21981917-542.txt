Diseases of the Rectum and Anus—Congenital Defects.—Arrest of development in the rectal and anal portions of the alimentary canal, though not so frequent as at the upper or buccal extremity, is unfortu- nately common enough to Justify a consideration of the different kinds of deformity which may here be met with, and the mode of treating them. Absence of the anus is one of the most frequent congenital lesions of the alimentary outlet. The rectum may be partially developed, and ter- minate within the pelvis in a blind pouch at a point more or less re- moved from the normal opening (Fig. 550); there may be a partial de- FiG. 550.—Atresia of the anus.

In the sim- pler forms of atresia ani only a thin membrane is stretched across the otherwise normal opening. The more complicated varieties are those

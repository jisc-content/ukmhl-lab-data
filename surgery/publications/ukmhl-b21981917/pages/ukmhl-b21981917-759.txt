ADHESION OF THE TENDONS. > T45 ration are established. Figs. 751 and 752 are taken from a hand one year after the receipt of a gunshot-wound. The muzzle of the piece was in contact with the skin at the time of the explosion, and the charge of Fig. 752.—Wound of exit of the charge. small shot and wadding entered at the palmar aspect of the little finger, and passed out through the metacarpal bone of the index-finger and to the ulnar side of the thumb. The third and fourth metacarpal bones were broken, while the second was comminuted and almost all of it blown away. The flexor tendons and fascia of the palm were torn and divided. The treatment consisted in immersion of the member in l-to-2000 subli- mate solution, thorough removal of powder and all foreign matter, repo- sition of attached fragments of bone and shreds of tendons, fascia, and muscle in as near their normal relation as possible, and applying a sub- limate-gauze dressing, placing the hand in the natural position and hold- ing it there with a splint and roller. In this case motion was secured in every finger, and no contractions of the fascia have taken place. When the tendons are divided, either in the forearm near the wrist, or in the palm or along the fingers, it is essential that the divided ends be stitched together with silk sutures. Co- caine anaesthesia and Esmarch's band- age should be employed. Deformities of the hand and fingers Fig. 753.—Deformity resulting from exostosis. (After Annandale and Noble Smith.) Fig. 754.—Deformity resulting from chondroma of the phalanges. also result from exostosis and new formations of cartilage in the digits (Figs. 753, 754). Amputation is indicated in the latter condition, while in exostosis relief may be obtained by direct incision and removal of the offending bone.

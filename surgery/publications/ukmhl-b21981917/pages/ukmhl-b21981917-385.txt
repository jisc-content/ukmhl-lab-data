The tendon may be retracted to the side most conven- ient. The posterior segment of the an- nular ligament is divided, and the tis- sues lifted from the bones with the elevator. The end of the radius should be removed with the exsector or gouge, when the carpus may be displaced backward through the incision, and removed wholly or in pieces. When the section is completed, the surfaces should be brought in apposition and fixed upon a well-adjusted anterior splint. Or an interrupted dressing may be applied by incasing the forearm in plaster of Paris to within an inch of the incision, and the fingers and hand in the same material, back as far as the anterior limit of the wound. A piece of hoop-iron (or several pieces of telegraph-wire twisted into a single piece) is shaped as shown in Fig. 409, incorporated into the plaster upon the arm, and made to loop over the wrist to the tips of the fingers, where it is turned back underneath the hand, and is fastened to the plaster here by an additional gypsum bandage (Fig. 410).

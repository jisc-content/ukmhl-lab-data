200 ' OBSERVATIONS ON PoTTfuppofed had been a double fold of the inner coat of the gut protruded, and which had loft its natural texture and co- lour. The firfl excrefcence which appeared feemed large enough to have filled the circumference of the interline; it had a broader bafis than I have ufually fince feen, therefore Mr. Pott paffed a double ligature through; and tying them on each fide left it to flough off, which it did in a few days; afterwards two fmaller ones came forward, were held by the hook, and furrounded by the ligature $ they alfo came away in the poultices, and the Gentleman returned home in the courfe of three weeks perfectly cured. The progrefs and fymptoms of the other cafes' were nearly the fame, therefore I need not be minute in defcribing them. CASE II. MRS.râ€”had been many years dreadfully afflicted with this difeafe, and the furgeons of the town where fhe refided pronounced it abfolutely to be a cancer; her pain prevent- ed her from walking or fitting upright, and fhe lay on a fofa patiently expecting a painful death.

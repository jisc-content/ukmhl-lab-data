A TREATISE ON 124 The means of cure propofed and prac- tifed by our anceftors, were three, viz. cauftic, ligature, and incifion. The intention in each of thefe is the fame, viz, to form one cavity of the finus and inteftine, by laying the former into the latter. Fear of haemorrage, in making a large divifion of parts, and a defign to deftroy callofity, gave rife to the ufe of cauftics for this purpofe. By the introduction of them in different forms and manners into the finus, that part of the inteftine which divides its cavity from that of the abfcefs is intended to be deftroyed; and thereby the propofed end of making one cavity of two is to be accomplifhed; while at the fame time, the fuppofed callofity is to be wafted. For this purpofe, fome of the moft fatiguing and painful efcharotics have been prefcribed and ufed: the pulvis angelicus, the lapis in- fernalis, and troches and paftes made with fublimate, arfenic, &c. But the method is fo cruel, fo tedious, and fo inexpert, that I hope it is by this time totally out of ufe: }t was founded in error, tends only to 3 mifchief,

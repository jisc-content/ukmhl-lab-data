THE FISTULA IN ANO. I25 mifchief, and I will not wafte the reader's time in faying any thing more about it.a The terror which a cutting inftrument neceffarily carries with it, the fear of a flux of blood from fome confiderable vefTels, together with a ftrange, nonfenfical opinion, that a gradual divifion of the parts was fol- lowed by a more found cure, than an im- mediate one by cutting, produced the coarfe, unhandy method by ligature. The manner of ufing it was this: A probe, or needle, (according to the complete or incomplete ftate of the fuppofed flftula) armed with a 1 DoÂ£tor Daniel Turner, who pracYifed furgery within thefe few years, ufed this method in its full extent. In his works may be found an account of his forming tents of the trochifci e minio, and thrufting them into the finus, there to remain till they had produced a fufficient efchar. In the fame writer are accounts of itrong probe-fcihors, made to cut through parts of a confiderable thicknefs, and where the external orifice was at a great diftance from the anus: and of an iron fcoop, made (to ufe the doctor's own words) like a cheefe-monger's tafter, to be thruft up the redtum, and affift in the divifion of it. What ideas this gentleman had of the difeafe, or of human fenfation, I cam- not imagine. The fame gentleman, fpeaking of the ufe of this iron fcoop, tells us, that when he ufed it on one particular patient, the man thought that the Doclor was only thrufting up the dreflings. It is no difficult matter to conceive what kind of draftings this man mull have been accuftomed to, who could not diftlnguifh between the application of them, and the thrufting up an iron fcoop. nrong

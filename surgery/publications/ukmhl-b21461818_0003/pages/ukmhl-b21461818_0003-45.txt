BY MEANS OF A SETON". 31 In By thefe means the inflammation is loon, and eafily appeafed. As foon as this end is accompiifhed, I permit the patient to get out of bed, and lie on a couch, or lit in a great chair with his legs up; and I generally give the cortex in fome form or other twice or thrice a day. The forenefs and tumefaction now dimi- nifh apace; and as foon as the parts are quite eafy, which is generally about the tenth or twelfth day, I begin to withdraw the feton, taking out four, five, fix, or feven threads of it at each dreffing, which dreffing connfts of nothing more than a fuperficial pledget upon each of the orifices while they continue open, and a difcutient cerate (fuch as the ceratum faturnin.) to cover the fcrotum. The di I charge of matter from the orifices is fmall and trifling, no more than might be expected; the tunica vaginalis does not be- come floughy, but is preferved entire; and the cure is accompiifhed merely by the coa- lefcence or cohefion of tbe tunica vaginalis, with the tunica albuginea : an event, which, from what has fallen within my obfervation, I am inclined to believe, is moft frequently the confequence of a fevere hernia humo- ralis.

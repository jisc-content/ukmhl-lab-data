ON RUPTURES. 295 A man, about thirty-fix years old, was a patient in St. Bartholomew's for a fore leg. While he was there, he defired me to look at a rupture, which he had long had, and which was clearly omental and ir- reducible. When his leg was well, he defired me to cut him, as he called it; alleging, that his rupture was fo troublefome, that it prevent- ed him from following his bufinefs. I refufed it, and directed him to wear a fuf- penfory bag. He folicited me again and again, and at laft, overcome by his importunity, I per- formed the operation. The fac was thin, and the piece of omentum not large, nor at all altered, nor was there any thing elfe in the bag, I made a ligature, and cut it off without meddling with the tendon. From the time of the operation, he was in con- ftant pain all over his belly. Bleeding, laxative medicines, glyfters, &c. were adminiftered, but to no purpofe. U 4 On

BY MEANS OF AN INJECTION* 45 hydrocele of many years {landing: June 21, 1787, in the prefence of Mr. Pott, I paffed into it a trochar, and let out a very large quantity of fluid of the ufual colour and confiftence ; I found the tunica vaginalis re- markably thickened and unpliable; to the feel not unlike tripe or buff leather: the tefticle was much larger than the natural fize. On confidering every circumftance, it appeared to be a very unfavourable cafe for any operation except the palliative : however, as I was defirous to try the effect, of in- jection, and there was no probability of doing mifchief, I filled it with port wine diluted with water in which red rofe leaves had been boiled. The man felt not the fmaliefr. pain : after retaining it a few minutes, I fuf- Fered it to be difcharged: the next 'day a fmall degree of inflammation had taken place 5 the third day from the operation it was increafed, and the whole fcrotnm con- fiderably fwollen : the patient continued ab- folutely free from pain and fever : by way of precaution, a poultice was applied, and he took an opening draught. On the fixth day the inflammation continued, the fcrotum much fwollen, the patient without any other complaint.

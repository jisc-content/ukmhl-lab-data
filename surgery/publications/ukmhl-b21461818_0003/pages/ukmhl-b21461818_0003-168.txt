15° A TREATISE ON Prejudice often prevents us from feeing truth, though it frauds before us : for Mr. Le Dran, though he fo ftrongty recommends the extirpation of a portion of the inteftine, yet has made the fame obfervation on thofe fiftuhe which run too high for extirpation, as Mr. De la Faye: he has very juftly re- marked, that they will do well without fuch operation: and has given fo good and fo true an account of the matter, that it is amazing he mould not fee, that the lame method, both of reafoning and of adting, was equally applicable to both cafes; that is, to thofe fiftulae which do not extend fo high, as well as to thofe which do. He fays, <c Ou " trouve fouvent des finus qui montent fort " haut le long du redtum; & meme vers la " veflie, dans la tiflu cellulaire qui entoure " ces parties: finus qui femblent devoir <e rendre ces maladies incurables, parcequ'ils certainly well founded: but I rnuft own thajt it feems to me to be full as extraordinary, that he, who faw the pro- priety of its having been done before, Ihould not, at leaft, try what If would do afterward. If this experiment had been made, and the cafe properly conduced, I make little doubt that the patient might have been cured without the lofs of his fundamerit.

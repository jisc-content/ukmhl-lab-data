To which I anfwer, in the firfl place, that if what has been faid relative to the foft, and to the mixed cataract be true, I cannot help thinking it to be very advantageous. In the fecond place, that the opinion concern- ing the indirTolubility of the difplaced crys- talline has, I think, been taken up, and propagated, without proper authority from inquiry and experiment, fairly and deliber- ately made, and ftands merely on a few ac- cidental obfervations, which are by no means Satisfactory. And, in the third place, that, as far as my own inquiry and obfervation go, I am Satisfied, that it does difTolve wherever placed, provided it be perfeftly freed from its attachment in its natural nidusk. k While I was preparing thefe flieets for the prefs, an old man was taken into St. Bartholemew's, who had a cataraft in one eye, and had, by fome accident, loft the fight of the other. I couched him; the cataraft was as firm as I had ever felt any, and went down as eafily, as immediately, and as in- tirely as poflible. Three days after the. operation, he was feized with fo bad a fmall-pox, that he died on the eleventh, and the next day I took his eye home and examined it.

What the confequence of their treatment too frequently was, themfelves have told us; what that of attending more to the true nature of the cafe, and of acTring from fuch con- fideration has been, our/foldiers and lailors have of late years happily experienced. Perhaps fome of the cafes which I have related in the fourth traÂ£t, may not appear to others to be fo worthy of notice as they did to me. Some of them, I cannot help thinking, may deferve the attention of the younger part of the profeflion, to whofe information I wifh to contribute. Difeafes have, it is true, in general, a fort of regularity and order, a feries of caufes and events, by which they are known and diftinguiftied, yet we do now and then meet with fuch odd irregularities, fuch ftrange and unufual con- fequenceSj as puzzle and alarm even the foundeft judgment) and the longeft experience; and unlefs thefe be noted, the hiftory of diftempers will be imperfect. From writers of fyftems and inftitutes, (of furgery at leaft) fuch kind of knowledge is not to be expe&ed. They are raoft frequently mere compilers, and do little more than copy each other. The information which they convey, is at beft but fuperficial, and much more calculated to enable man to talk, than either to judge or to act. It mpft be from a careful attention to the cafes of individuals, and from an obfervation of difeafes, in their irregular and infrequent forms, as well as their more cuftomary ones, that true and extenlive judgment can be acquired. If therefore a faithful relation of thefe lefs-ufual circum- ftances and appearances, both in the living and in the dead, was more frequently made, it might be produ&ive of no final!

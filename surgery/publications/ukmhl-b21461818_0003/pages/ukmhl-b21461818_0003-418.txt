39& REMARKS ON . The third kind of diforder which I men- tioned as fometimes producing the neceffity Qf amputation, was the aneurifm. That kind of dilatation of the arterial tube, which is called a true aneurifm, is fometimes found in the middle, fometimes in the upper part of the thigh, and fome- times in the ham. The general charafreriftic marks of this diltemper are, a circumfcribed tumor, fmall at its firft appearance, but gradually in- creafing, and for fome length of time having a pulfatory motion and feel exactly corre- fpondent with the patient's pulfe at the wrift; this pulfation arifmg from the motion of the blood from the heart through the artery, is very ealily feen and felt for fome length of time, but as the tumor becomes gradually larger, the pulfation in it becomes more and more obfcure to the touch, and in length of time, when either the artery is dilated to a very confiderabie fize, or has burft, and has fhed part of its contents, the motion be- comes in fome cafes fo obfcure as hardly to be felt at all, or at lead, not without very di- ligent attention. When it has got into this operation be removed, will render it ineffectual, bold and bloody as it mult be. ftate

I3° A TREATISE ON The J extirpate all that is fiftulous and fcirrhousj " for that is a fure way to make one operation " perfect the cure." • In his Obfervations, publimed at the end of Mr. Gataker's tranflation of Le Dran's furgery, Mr. Chefelden defcribes a method of his own inventing, by the introduction of one blade of a pair of polypus-forceps into the finus, and of the other into the rectum 5 by which means, a certain portion of the in- terline is held fall between the chops of the inilrument, in order to be cut out with the fciiTors. After having given an explanation of a plate, defigned to reprefent the forceps in- troduced in fuch a manner as to hold the piece of interline faft, he adds, •— " 1 for- " merly cut out a pyramidal piece in the "manner here defcribed; but I find this " way with the forceps much more conve- *; nient, and more eafy to be executed.'' How much this method may be prefer- able to that which Mr. Chefelden ufed tcr praclife, I know not; but I will venture to fay, that this more eafy method is horridly painful, is operofe, and abfolutely unnecef- fary towards obtaining a cure.

I04 A TREATISE ON" Suppofe an abfcefs formed in the neigh- bourhood of the redum, which, after a cer- tain degree of fweliing and inflammation, ripens, or comes to a point, fomewhere near to the verge of the anus. Suppofe alfo a large and convenient opening to have been made by a Ample incifion; the contents of the abfcefs to have been thereby difcharged; and a fore or cavity produced, which is, perhaps, confiderable in fize: this cavity is to be filled up in fuch manner, as to produce a firm and lafting cure. The frequent ufe of the term filling up, and the general-received opinion, that the induration of the parts about is a difeafed callofity, appear to me to have been the two principal fources of error and mifconduct in thefe cafes. Wherever matter is formed in confequence of inflammation, it always leaves, upon being let out, a proportional hollow, and fome degree of induration. -The former of thefe is of different fize, according to the quantity of matter; and the latter depends both on the degree of previous inflammation and the more or lefs perfect fuppuration of the abfcefs.

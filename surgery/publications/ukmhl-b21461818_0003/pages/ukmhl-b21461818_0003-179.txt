THE FISTULA IN ANO. I 61 openings are only fo many diftinct burftings of the fkin covering the matter; and do all, be they few or many, lead and open im- mediately into the one fingle cavity of the abfcefs : they neither indicate, nor lead to, nor are caufed by,diftincl finufes; nor would the appearance of twenty of them (if pof- fible) neceffarily imply more than one ge- neral hollow* ; If this account be a true one, it will follow, that the chirurgic treatment of this kind of cafe ought to be very little, if at all, different from that of the preceding; and that all that can be neceffary to be done, muft be to divide each of thefe orifices in fuch manner as to make one cavity of the whole, This the probe knife will eafily and expeditioufly do; and when that is done, if the fore, or more properly its edges, mould make a very ragged, uneven ap- pearance, the removal of a fmall portion of fuch irregular angular parts will anfwer all the purpofes of making room for the application of dreihngs, and for producing a fmooth even cicatrix after the fore mall be healed.

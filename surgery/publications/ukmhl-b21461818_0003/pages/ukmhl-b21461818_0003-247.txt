The aqueous humour, however turbid it may become, will, in a very fhort fpace of time, be again perfectly clear; and if no diforder of the capfula of the cryftalline, previous, or confequential, prevents, the rays of lightf will pafs without obftruc- tion f The capfula, or inverting membrane of the cryftalline, has very often an unfufpected (hare in the apparent opacity of that body; and is thereby the caufe of difappointment,s and in- conveniences during fome operations, and after others. This is a circumftance which, undoubtedly, has been mentioned ; | but has not been by any means fufficiently attended to. The capfula, is capable of becoming white and opake, while its contents fhajl be clear and tranfparent; it becomes fo fome- times by being wounded by the couching-needle, ufed either for the depreffion of a firm cataradl, or for the letting out a foft one; and it will not infrequently be found fo, after the oper- ation of extraftion, when no inftrument has touched it. 1 3 Whenever

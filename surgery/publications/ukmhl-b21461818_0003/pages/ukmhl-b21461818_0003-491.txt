©F THE LOWER LIMBS. 469 by what I had a few opportunities of obferv- in°- in the dead bodies of fome who had died afflided with this diforder, - and altoge- ther fatisfied me, that there muft be fome<- thing predifpofmg in the parts concerned j and that when we attribute the ufelefs ftate of the limbs merely to the curvature, we miftake, as 1 have juft faid, an effect for a caufe. At the fame time I gave an account of a converfation, which pafled between me and the late Dr. Cameron, of Worceiter, who told ' me, that having remarked in Hippocrates, an account of a paralyfis of the lower limbs, cured by an abfcefs in the back, he had, in a cafe of ufelefs limbs attended with a curva- ture of the fpine, endeavoured to imitate this act of nature by exciting a purulent difcharge, peated enquiry and examination, I am convinced that they are not. The bodies of the vertebra? concerned are often affetted, while the ligaments bear but little mark of diftemper; but whe- ther the ligaments be affefted, or not, the bodies of the verte- bras are always difeafed, which difeafe does not fo properly enlarge as erode: the Hate alfo of the intervertebral cartilages, 1 find to be fubjeft to great variety, they being fometimes totally deflroyed, while the caries is fmall in degree, frmetimes appa- rently but little injured, where the caries has done considerable jnifchief, and fometimes totally deftroyed and annihilated.

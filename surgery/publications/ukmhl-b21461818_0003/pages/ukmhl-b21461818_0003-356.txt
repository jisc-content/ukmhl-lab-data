OBSERVATIONS 334 CASE XVIII. I was defired to be prefent at the open> ing of the body of a gentleman, whofe dif- eafe and death had occafioned fome alter- cation among thofe who had attended him. The account given of him while living was, that to the age of fifty-fix he had en- joyed an uninterrupted ftate of health. That at the age of forty, he difcovered a rupture, for which he immediately took ad- vice, and put on a trufs: that the trufs not anfwering the purpofe, he foon direw it aiide, and fuffered his rupture to take its courfe. That it gradually increafed until it became both vilible and troublefome. That he then applied to Mr. Sainthill, and Mr. Samuel Sharpe, both of whom en- deavoured to reduce it but in vain, and both advifed him to wear a lulpenfory bag, which he, from that time, had conftantly done. That from that time he had never complained of any uneafinefs but what was occafioned by its mere weight. That he very feldom miffed having a ftool every morning.

SOME FEW REMARKS ON THE POLYPUS of the NOSE. In thefe, as in the preceding remarks on *the cataract, I do not mean to enter into a circumftantial hiftory of the difeafe, but merely to offer a few practical obfervations on fuch parts of the doctrine concerning it, as appear to me to have been either inadver- tently or erroneoufly delivered. The polypus is a complaint which is al- ways troublefome, frequently painful, and fometimes hazardous; the firft of thefe is, the neceiTary confequence of the fituation of the diitemper; the fecond arifes from its pe- culiar nature in the individual; and the laft, lometimes from its particular nature, and fometimes from the manner in which it may have been treated.

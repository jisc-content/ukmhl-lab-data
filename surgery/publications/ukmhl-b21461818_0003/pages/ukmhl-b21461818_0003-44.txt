30 RADICAL CURE OF THE HYDROCELE with little more pain than is felt in common- tapping. By this method, every advantage which attended the former .operation is obtained, and every inconvenience which it was liable to, is obviated and provided againft. The feton-cannula, by its firmnefs, bears tight againft the place where the feton mould be brought out; the trochar-point of the probe is kept from deviating by its confine- ment, and its point pierces through the Ikin immediately, and exactly in the place intend- ed; while the feton by pairing through the cannula is prevented from rubbing rudely over the tefticle. As foon as the operation is finifhed, I put the patient into bed, and immediately give him twenty or twenty-five drops of tinctura thebaica, which I repeat or not, pro re nata. About the third day the tefticle and fcro- tum begin to inflame and fwell, 'and to put on the appearance of a hernia humoralis, or the fwelled tefticle 'which now and then attends a clap j and requires the fame and no other kind of treatment; that is, fomen- tation, poultice, a fufpenfory bag, a coo!, temperate regimen, and an open belly.

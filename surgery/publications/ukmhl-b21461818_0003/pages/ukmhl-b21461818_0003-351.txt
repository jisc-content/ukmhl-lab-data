ON RUPTURES. 329 part within, or caufing it. And it alfo fome- times happens, thatperfons airlifted with un- reduced, or irreducible ruptures, are rendered incapable of difcharging their fseces per anum, by caufes which have not the leaft connection with, or dependence upon the rupture, or the inteftine contained within it. Thus it becomes a furgeon's care to endeavour to be able not only to know when a hernia is the caufe of bad fymptoms, but alfo when it is not; as his conduct upon thefe d/fferent oc- casions muft be very materially different: for, on the one hand, if the mifchief arifes from the inteftine being bound by a ftricture, no- thing but the reduction of it by the hand, or the fetting it free lfy the chirurgic operation, can preferve the patient; but on the other, if the fymptoms proceed from another caufe even though the portion, of inteftine within the hernia mould be the immediate feat of the evil, the attempts for reduction will be painful and vain, the operation at beft ufelefs, and moft probably prejudicial; and if the feat and caufe of the mifchief be not within the rupture, both the laft-mentioned attempts become thereby ftill more improper, more ufelefs, and more pernicious. . \C A S E

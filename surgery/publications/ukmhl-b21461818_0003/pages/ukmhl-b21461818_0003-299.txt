The fcrotum and hernial fac were com- pletely mortified, and within the latter was a fmall quantity of a moft exceedingly offen- five fanies, together with a large piece of fphacelated omentum only. The whole in- teftinal tube was within the belly perfectly found, and in good order; but the omentum, within that cavity, had partaken confider- ably of the mifchief done to that part of it which was in the hernial fac, and was gan- grenous throughout.

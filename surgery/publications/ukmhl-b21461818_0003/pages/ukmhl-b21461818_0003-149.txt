THE FISTULA IN ANO. I^I The wound, that is, the orifice of the firms in the buttock, is by Mr. Chefelden's direc- tion, to be firft dilated with a fponge tent ; th en one of the blades of a pair of large poly- pus-forceps is to be thruft up the fmus, while the other within the inteftine pinches it be- tween them; and then this piece fo pinched is to be fnipped out by the repeated attacks of a pair of fciffors. A very tedious and very painful operation this muft neceflarily be; and by Mr. Chefelden's own account, not al- ways fuccefsful: for although he does fay,— " The operation being thus performed, I have " never found wanting a fecond cutting;" yet he immediately adds, —" If, after this tc operation, there is frill an internal dif- " charge into the gut, it may be an ufeful " hTue; and continue the benefit which na- " ture defigned by the difeafec. We fhould c This is a method of making an iflue to which few people would (I believe) chufe to fubmit: efpecially if they confider that they might have enjoyed all the benefit of it, without any operation at all; merely by leaving their difeafe to nature. The fame gentleman, fpeakingof the inteftine reftum, tells us, that he once applied a cauftic lengthways on the infide of the inverted gut, to cure a prolapfus; and adds, that it proved fuc- cefsful. This I am almolt forry for; left Mr. Chefelden's au- thority mould tempt any other perfon to make the fame attempt. K 2 " alfQ)

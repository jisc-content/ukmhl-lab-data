OF THE LOWER LIMBS. 417 The difeafe of which I mean to fpeak, is generally called a palfy; as it confifts in a total or partial abolition of the power of iifing, and fometimes of even moving the lower limbs, in confequencej as is generally fuppofed, of a curvature of fome part of the ipine. To this diftemper both fex'es; and all ages; are equally liable. If the patient be an in- fant, it becomes an objec~l of conftant, though unavailing diftrefs to its parents; if an adult, he is rendered perfectly helplefs to himfelf; and ufelefs to all others^ which, of all poffible ftates, is furely the very worft. When this difeafe attacks an infant of only a year or two old, or under, the true caufe of it is feldom difcovered until fome time after the effect has taken place, at lean: not by parents and nurfes, who know not where to look for it. The child is faid to be un- commonly backward in the ufe of his legs, or it is thought to have received fome hurt in its birth. When it affects a child who is old enough to have already walked, and who has been, able to walk, the lofs of the ufe of his legs is gradual, though in general not very flow. Vol. III. E e He

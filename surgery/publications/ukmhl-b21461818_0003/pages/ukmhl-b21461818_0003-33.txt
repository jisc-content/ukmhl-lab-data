21 BY MEANS OF A SETON. The means and conduct were nearly the fame, and I have no doubt that the fuccefs Was equal. But the fame objection ftill re- mained j which was, that not only a fitppu- Iration was brought on, but the whole tunica vaginalis was fo irritated and inflamed, that it necefTarily became floiigby, and was en- tirely deftroyed: an objection which had been made to the method by cauftiej and which, I muft acknowledge, is, in my opi- nion, an objection to it ftill. The late profeifor Monro, whofe obferva- tioris on the difeafes of the tefticle are very pertinent and very ingenious, feemed to think that it was by no means impracticable, by means of a flight degree of irritation, to excite fuch an inflammation both in the tunica vaginalis and albugihea, as might occafion a coalefctence of them with each other, and thereby anfwer the end of abolilh- ing the cavity, without deftroying any part of either tunic. *Â« fuperiori, ad teius; tumque vulnns turunda oblonga, unguento " rofaceo mercurio pnecipitato rubro inun&o oppleveris, donee " lems inflammatio, eique fucccdens fuppuratio parva, mem- " branules ftillames putrefcerit, tunCque eas tenaculo eduxeris,'' Sec. r> KUYSCH.

^44 ON THE POLYPt/S Writers tell us, and very truly, that it is a difeafe of the membrana pituitaria narium, that it has different feats, origins, and at- tachments; that it fprings from the ethmoid bone, from the offa fpongiofa, from the feptum narium, and even from the antra maxillaria: that it is hard or foft, pale or deep red, or fometimes purple; that it is equal m its furface or unequal, large or final], moveable or fixed, fingle or multiform, painful or indolent; that it makes its appear- ance forward in the noftrils, or backwards in the fauces behind the uvula; and that it may be ftrumous, venereal, or cancerous* When they have given us thefe general, and merely definitive defcriptions, they immedi- ately proceed to the chirurgic treatment, off method of cure; which, they tell us, is either by extraction, or the ufe of efcharotics, to which fome have added ligature: they then give a general defcription of the manner of ufing the forceps, of applying efcharotics, or of pafTing the ftring round it; and having provided ftyptics for the fuppreffion of hemorrhage, they leave every thing elie to the reader's imagination, and to the prac- titioner's choice and judgment.

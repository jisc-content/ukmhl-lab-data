THE FISTULA IN ANO. I37 f ternal orifice in the buttock at fuch dif- * tance from the anus, that, if the operation * be performed in the manner juft defcribed, ' it would oceafion too large a lofs of fub- Â« fiance. In this cafe, the finus muft be ' opened lengthways by means of a grooved * director.' Mr. De la Faye does not indeed fay, in exprefs terms, that this longitudinal divivion will be fufficient for a cure; but I will venture to fay for him, that I know, from repeated experience, that it will. The obfervation, therefore, which this gentleman has made, concerning the lofs of fubftance, is not only juft and true in itfelf; bnt it is alfo an obfervation, which, if properly at- tended to, will lead to a truth which he does not feem to have been fufficiently ap- prifed of; which is, that every operation of -this fort, (that is, every extirpation of parts,) is unneceflary, and therefore wrong. Large hollows, in which confiderable quantities of matter have been formed; whofe extent, with regard to the interline, is deep; and whofe orifice is in the buttock, at a diftance from the anus, have always more induration about them, and difcharge a larger quantity of gleet, than th<?fe which are fmaller, more fliajlow.

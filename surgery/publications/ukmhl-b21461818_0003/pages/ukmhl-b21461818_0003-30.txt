For a particular elucidation of this fub- jedt, the chirurgic world are much obliged to the late Profeffor Monro of Edinburgh, and Mr. Samuel Sharp, late of Guy's Hof- pital, now of Bath. The accounts which many of the beft among the writers in furgery, even quite into our own time, have given of the dif- eafes of thefe parts, under the terms farco- cclc, fungus attached to the fpermatic vef- fels,' fungus arifmg from the tcftis, hydro- cele, and hydro^farcocele, are error itfelf; and\the operations which they defcribe, and recommend, are many of them coarfe, and either impracticable, or very unfit for praaice But however from thefe accounts, ftranec and irrational as they are, we may colled that they conceived the difeafes whicn they call the hydro-farcocele, and the caro adnata ad vafa fpermatica, to be (in con- mdiftindion from the farcocele and the fungus fpringing from the tefticleO curab e difeafes, the one by extirpation of the fungus, the other by foppuradon. ^

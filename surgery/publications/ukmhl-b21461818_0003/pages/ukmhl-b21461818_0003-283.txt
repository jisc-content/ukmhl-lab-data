CANCER SCROTI. 26l part: all this makes it (at firft) a very dif- ferent cafe from a cancer which appears in an elderly man, whofe fluids are become acrimonious from time, as well as other caufes; or from the fame kind of complaint in women who have ceafed to menftruate. But be all this as it may, the fcrotum is no vital organ, nor can the lofs of a part of it ever be attended with any, the fmalieft degree of inconvenience; and if a life can be preferved by the removal of all that portion that is diftempered, it will be a very good and eafy compofition; for when the difeafe has got head, it is rapid in its pro- grefs, painful in all its attacks, and molt certainly deftruclive in its event.

In fuch cafe, the remedy muit. be an in- ternal one; and whoever depends upon ex- ternals will give his patient much unneceflary trouble and only wafte his time. The truth is, this doctrine of the neceffityr of cutting out a portion of the inteftine, (though it is as old, or perhaps older than Celfusf) is almofr. a neceflary confequence of the manner in which thefe fores (upon a fuppofition of their being fiftulous) almoft always have been, and do ft ill continue to be, generally treated.â€”I mean, the euftom of cramming them full of lint, and of charg- ing that lint with medicines, which, though f * In hoc genere demiffo fpecillo, daubus lincis incidcnda * cutis eft, at media inter eas habenula tenuis admodum injicia- * tur, ne protinus ora coeant, fitque locus aliquis linimentis, s qujE quam pauciflima fuperinjicicnda funt, omniaque codem ' modo facienda, qua in abfceflibus pofua funt.'

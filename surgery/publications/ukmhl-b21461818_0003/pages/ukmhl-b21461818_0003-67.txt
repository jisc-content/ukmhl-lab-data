BY MEANS OF AN INJECTION. 53 fimilar in every refpect, was put under my care ; the age of the man nearly equal; con- flitution, duration and lize of his com- plaint, as nearly refembling the other as poffible. To give a fair trial to both methods, I palfed a feton in this; the complaint pro- ceeded very well with moderate inflam- mation. The feton was gradually removed, thread by thread, as they became loofe ; in about ten days, the fcrotum began to lelTen and collapfe; a fmall abfcefs however was formed, the matter of which emptied itfelf by the lower orifice. On the whole, this cafe gave as little trouble, and ended as hap- pily as the mode of treating it, by intro- ducing and retaining a foreign body, gene- rally does. Bat I muft mod truly confefs that it did not feem comparable to the in- jection, by which means all accefs to air is denied : no difcharge is necefTary; the in- flammation is infinitely more moderate, the duration of it lefs, and no abfceffes are formed.

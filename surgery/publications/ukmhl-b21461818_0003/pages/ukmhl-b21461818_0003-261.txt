the cataract. The couching needle which is com- monly in ufe has on the face which is applied to the cataract, a flat, highly- polifhed furface, which makes it, as I have experienced, liable to flip, if it meets with any little refiftance when in contact with the furface of the cata- ract; or if the chryftalline breaks, it does not readily attach the fmall por- tions of it. As the other fide, near the point, is neceflarily convex, to give a proper degree of ftrength to the initru- ment, I conceived that an advantage might be drawn from its form to ob- viate the inconvenience; I therefore got fome needles made with a fmall ca- vity on the flat fide, the oppofite con- vexity allowing fufficient depth for it, and the furface of this cavity was left rough and unpolifhed. I have ufed them many times during feveral years, and I am of opinion that this alteration gives a confiderable advantage in laying hold of that fmall flippery body the lens, or any fragment of it, and in conducting it to whatever part of the eye we think proper ■ by a turn of the inftrument it is immediately difengaged, and neither the entrance nor paflage of the needle is in any degree impeded by it. v .

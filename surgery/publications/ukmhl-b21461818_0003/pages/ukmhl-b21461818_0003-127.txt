The intention in this operation is to divide the inteftine rectum from the verge of the anus up as high as the top of the hollow in which the matter was formed; thereby to lay the two cavities of the gut and abfcefs into one; and by means of an open, inftead of a hollow or fmuous fore, to obtain a firm and lafting cure. Ingenious, mechanical, and whimfical people b have often bufied themfelves in inventing inftruments for this purpofe: the fyringotomy, the cultellus falcatus, the probe-razor, &c. have all at times been in ufe; fchTors alfo of various kinds, both ftraight and crooked, have been employed in this operation; the three nrft may be made to ferve the purpofe very wellj but to the laft, (the fciffors) there is in this, as well as in almoft every operation in which they are frequently ufed, a palpable objection, viz. b The late Mr. Freeke invented an inftrument for this pur- pofe; but it was, upon trial, found to cut the operator's finger, with fo much more certainty than the patient's inteftine, that it has long been laid afide. that

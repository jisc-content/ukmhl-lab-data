J52 A TREATISE ON I I ^ 3earned from experience, that thefe linufcs fill up within the firft fix days — 6 Or, If " Venai'Um majorum' <"^io inititui nequit; adeoque tunc parum plerumque, imp vero nihil omnino crururgi amficia proficiunt," &c. This, which, as I have obferved before, is the doclrine of all cur writers, has always flood upon the fame principle, viz the fear of hemorrhage ; and all the propagators of it hare al- ways fuppofcd, that nothing but a divifion of the whole ftnus could poflibly produce a cure; which fuppofition is by no means true. • When the cafe is an abfcefs formed in the cellular membrane the length of the finus muft be proportioned to the diftance of the feat of fnch abfcefs from its external orifice: this is fome times confiderable, quite out of the reach of the finder in ano but it does by no means follow, that either this fihus muft be divided through its. whole length; or that the difeafe cannot be cured ; and therefore that it is better not to meddle with it at all. Frequent experience proves the contrary. If all that part of it which is within the reach of the finger in ano, (that is, all that part of it which is principally affefted by the adlion of the mufcles of the anus and reftum) be fairly divided • if the wound fo made be drefled in fuch manner as to produce no inflammatory irritation; if it be not frequently poked into and examined; and the patient's habit be properly taken care of the length of the finus will add very little to the difficulty at- tending the cure; all that is out of reach will collapfe and heal • and the cafe will very foon be eXaflly the fame, as if the whole hollow was within the finger's length. The probability of an haemorrhage from the large veffels about the upper part of the reftum, is a thing which ought by all means to be avoided, as it might give a great deal of trouble, and create fome hazard; but the operation which would induce fuch^

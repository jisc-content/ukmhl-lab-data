PREFACE. 75 To point fuch method out is the intention of the follow- ing TracT:. In the execution of it, I have fometimes found myfelf under a neceflity of controverting the opinion of fome gentlemen of deferved eminence : if I -have done this with decency and good manners, no apology is necefiary. The honour of our art, and the moral characters of its profeflbrs fuffer, whenever we pay fo blind deference to any one, as prevents us from ufing our >own judgments, and from declaring freely the refults of our inquiries or experiments. Truth, as Lord Bacon has faid, is not the child of authority, but of time. And were we to allow ourfelves to fuppofe, (let the fubjecl be what it may, provided it be liable to experiment) that nothing more, or new, could be taught, it is pretty clear, that nothing more or new would be learned. I therefore hope, that the freedom which I have ufed, either in relating the opinions, or in objeaing to the prac- tice of others, will not be attributed to an invidious difT pofition to find fault; but merely to a defire of being fer- viceable to mankind in that way, in which, I flatter my- felf, that I may be in fome degree capable; and of im- proving, as much as in me lies, the very necefiary, and univerfally ufeful Science of SURGERY.

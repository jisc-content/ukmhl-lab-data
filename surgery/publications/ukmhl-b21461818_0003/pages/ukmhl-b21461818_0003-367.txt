ON RUPTURES. 345 I contented myfelf with merely dividing the fcrotum and hernial fac, and left the rot- ten inteftine as it was, lying in the groin on the outfide of the ring, concluding that a very mort fpace of time would determine the poor. man's fate, and that not favourably. The gentlemen whom I had met continued to at- tend, and to take care of him : the mortified parts caff, off; he difcharged his faeces through his wound for fome time, but that, in no great length of time, ceafed; and within the fpace of a month, I faw him in very good health, difcharging all his faeces per anum, and having only a fmall, clean, and healing fore, where his wound had been. How the faeces paffed from the ileum to the colon, after the mortified parts were thrown off, I am, considering the fize of the portion of gut, really at a lofs to account for; but very fure I am, that if the advice given by all writers, in thefe cafes, to cut off the piece of mortified inteftine, and faften the found part to the upper part of the wound, had been followed, the man would have pafled the remainder of his life in a much more unT pleafant manner.

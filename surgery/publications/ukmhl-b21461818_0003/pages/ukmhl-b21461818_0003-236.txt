21 8 REMARKS ON colour, which are faid to indicate unripenefs, and ripenefs, are often as perfectly foft as they ever could have been; and on the other hand, will fometimes find them what is call- ed firm or hard very foon after the firft ap- pearance of obfcurity. That is, to fpeak more truly, as well as more properly,' the former having been at firft diffolved, have remained in the fame ftate of dirTolution; and the latter, having been at firft only par- tially foftened, have been found in the fame unequal ftate, with a firm nucleus"1. When, therefore, I make ufe of the term induration, I do it in compliance with the common method of fpeaking; and not be- caufe I think that it conveys, by any means, an adequate idea of the real alteration made in the ftate of the cryftalline: far from it; it neither conveys an idea of the nature, nor d For this there is no poffibility of accounting rationally, but by having recourfe to the natural ftate of the cryftalline, with regard to the different confiflence of its different parts.

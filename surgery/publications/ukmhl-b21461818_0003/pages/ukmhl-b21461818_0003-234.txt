2I6 REMARKS ON natural ftate, it is capable of feveral morbid alterations: it is capable of being dhTolved, or of becoming fluid, without lofing any thing of its tranfparency1': it is capable of being diffolved into an apparently uniform fluid of a gelatinous kind of confidence, but which will be more or lefs opake through the whole; it fometimes becomes opake while it undergoes a partial kind of dilu- tion, which leaves or renders the different parts of it of very different degrees of con- fidence; and it now and then, though very to, it would folve many of the appearances in catarafts which, for want of fuch attention, are either not accounted for, or very abfurdly. Among other phenomena, it would account for the very different colour which the different parts of the fame cataract frequently bear; and which has furnj/hed the wildeft conjectures. b It has been fuppofed, by very good anatomifts, that the human cryftalline has fometimes, between its furface and its capfula, a fmall quantity of fine pellucid lymph; and confe- quently that there is no immediate connexion between that body and its inverting membrane. In many beails, as well as fifties; this is known to be the cafe; but whether it be fo in the human eye, is not very eafy to be known during life; but that this is the cafe, fometimes from dillemper, I have no doubt: I mean, that the whole cryftalline is diffolved into a fluid, ftill preferving its tranfparency. This kind of alteration, as I take it, forms what is by fome called one fpecies of the gutta ferena; by others, the black cataraft. rarely,

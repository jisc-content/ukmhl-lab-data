ON RUPTURES. 305 fwooning, or From the irritation made in the fnteftinal canal* or> which is much more likely, from both conjointly, I have, feveral times, feen ruptures, which have refifted all attempts by the hand, return of themfeives, untouched, during the influence of fuch glyfter. Many other Simulating applications to the rectum, I have, at different times, made trial of, but never found any at all equal, in ef- fect, to the tobacco; nor did I ever fee any of them produce that eonvulfive motion of the mufcles of the abdomen, which moll frequently accompanies the ficknefs attending the ufe of this weed, and which, although fatiguing and troublefome While it lads, yet is certainly one of the means whereby the extrication of the portion of inteftine is ac- complifhed. I have alfo feveral times feert them both fail, after fair and repeated trial. Whoever expects infallibility in medicine, will be dif- appointed; but I can, with truth affirm, that I have feen both the fmoke and the in- fufion fucceed much oftener than any thing elfe, and fometimes in very defperate cafes.

370 ON THE MORTIFICATION, &C. capable of being eafily taken away, it is, in general, thought right to remove them. However rotten and loofe they may feari to be, or really are, yet while they hold on, they hold by fomething which is ftill endued with fenfation, as may always be known, if they be bent back or twifted with any degree of violence. I will not enter into a difpute about the fenfibility or infenfibility of ligaments, nor undertake to determine whether they be liga- ments or any other kind of parts which ftill maintain the connection of the toes with their own refpedtive joints, or with the me- tatarfal bones; it is fumcient for me to know, and to inform the young practitioner, â€¢ that however looie they may feem, jetif they be violently [twifted off, or the parts, by which they hang, be divided, a very confiderable degree of pain will , moft commonly attend fuch operation, which therefore had much better be avoided ; and that I have feen this very pain, thus produced, bring on frefh naif- chief, and that of the gangrenous kind. If the patient does well, thefe parts will certainly drop off: if he does not, no good can rife from removing them. REMARKS

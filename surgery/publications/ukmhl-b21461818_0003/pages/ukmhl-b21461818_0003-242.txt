224 REMARKS OPT The obje&lons which are made againn: the operation of couching, at leaft thofe which have any femblance of truth or force, are reducible to four. The firft is, that if the cataract be per- fectly foft, the operation will not be fuc- cefsful, from the impoflibility of accom- plifhing the propofed end of it. The fecond is, that if it be of the mixt kind, partly foft, and partly hard, it will alfo moft probably fail of fuccefs, not only from the impracticability of depreffing the fofter parts, but alfo becaufe the more firm ones will either elude the point of the needle, and remaining in the pofterior cham- ber, ftill form a cataract; or getting through the pupil into the anterior chamber, will there bring on pain and inflammation, and induce a necefTity of dividing the cornea for their difcharge. The third is, that if the cataract be of the firm, folid kind, and therefore capable of being deprefTed, yet, in whatever part of the eye it mail happen to be placed, it will there remain undiffolved, folid, opake; and although removed from the pupil, yet prove fome hindrance to perfect vifion.

The violent paffage of the catheter through the neck of the bladder (for violent in fuch circumftances it muft be) can never be right. I will not fay that it never fucceeds; but I will fay, that it can hardly ever be proper to make the attempt. If the inftrument be fuccefsfully intro- duced, it muft either be withdrawn as foon as the bladder is emptied, or it muft be left in it: if the former be done, the fame caufe of retention remaining, the fame effect returns ; the fame pain and violence muft again be fub- mitted to, under (moft likely) increafed dif- ficulties. On the other hand, if the catheter be left in the bladder, it will often, while its neck is in this ftate, occafion fuch diftur- bance, that the remedy (as it is called) will prove an exafperation of the difeafe, and add to the evil it is defigned to alleviate : nor is this all; for the refiftance which the parts, while in this ftate, make, is fometimes fo great, that if any violence be ufed, the inftru- ment will make for itfelf a new rout in the neighbouring parts, and lay the foundation of fuch mifchief as frequently bafHes all our art.

How then is fuppuration to be produced and maintained ? Not by thruft- ing in fuch applications, as by their quantity diftend, and by their quality irritate and de-^ ftroy; but by dreffing lightly and eafily with fuch as appeafe, relax and foften. The facl is capable of experiment; and every man who will make it, that is, who will try the different methods, and attend to the confequenees, muft be able to determine it; unlefs blinded by prejudice, or influenced by a worfe motive -A moment's attention to the conduct, of nature, when left to herfelf, and not inter- rupted by art, will, perhaps, fet this matter in a clearer light.

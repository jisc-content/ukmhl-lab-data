A TREATISE ON The haemorrhage, (to fay nothing of the pain) which now and then attends the ex- tirpation of a large piece of the inteftine and fundament, is alarming, both to weak minds and to weak bodies ; and the incon- veniences arifing from lofs of fubftance about the verge of the anus, either in ftrong ternals, the furgeon will gain little ground. This is a circum- flance which ought always to be attended to; and it is in fome meafure owing to a want of due regard to it, that we find fuch a farrago of different dreffings; fuch remedies for fungous, for foul, for callous fores, Sec. Thefe difeafed appearances and circumftances moft frequently proceeded from diforders in the habit; and if that be not corre&ed, the fame appearances will continue, notwithftanding -all our efcharotics, deturgents, digeftives, incarnatives, &c. &c. &c. In cold, debauched, lax, or fluggifh habits, if the patient be not wanned by aromatics, and braced by the bark, thefe cafes will often prove tedious and troublefome. From the induration of the parts about, from the face and colour of the fore, and from the difcoloured gleety difcharge, callofity, latent mifchief, and undifcovered finufes, will be fulpe&ed ; whereas, in truth, neither one nor the other are the caufe of fuch difeafed appearances. The adminiftratiori of proper remedies will, moil commonly, in a few days, produce fuch an alteration, as the whole art of furgery could not (by mere externals) bring about in as many weeks, if at all. Many and many a fore of this kind have I feen brought into the hof- pital, which has had all thefe difagreeable appearances, which has long and fruitlefsly been^treated with all the variety of ex- ternals, and which a decodtion of the bark and rad ferpentarir has, in a very fhort time, put into fuch a condition as to want only dry lint. exercife,

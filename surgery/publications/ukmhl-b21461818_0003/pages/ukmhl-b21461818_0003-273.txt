OF THE NOSE. 253 tire ftate of the inverting membrane, and the feparation of the polypus from its fmgle point of attachment, will upon careful examination appear irrefragable prootsc. It may perhaps be remarked, that, in what I have offered concerning this diftemper, I have confined myfelf merely to the operation of extraction only; and have faid nothing concerning: the various methods and means which have been propofed for its deftruction. e Mr. Pott was particularly competent to defcribe this dif- eafe, having been troubled with polypi in his nofe during many years; at one time they increafed to fuch a degree as to diftend the noftrils, and almoft totally to prevent the paf- fage of air; when they were fallen fufficiently low, Mr. Pott took an opportunity, in moift weather, and when they were in a ftate of relaxation, to extract the moll prominent ones for himfelf, by means of a pair of window forceps before a mir- ror. In no great length of time others came in fight and fup- plied their place, which alfo Mr. Pott extracted- in the fame manner, till he had a collection of five or fix large polypi; one of them had a fingle bafis, but was branched out into two large lobes; to fome of them there adhered a fmall portion of bone, to which they had been fixed ; a fufficient proof that it required ho fmall degree of fortitude and perfeverance to perform the operation on his own perfon. Of late years he had entirely got rid of them; but there remained fuch a thicknefs of the whole membrane, that he continued totally deprived of the fenfe of fmelling; a circumftance which he never much regretted.â€”E.

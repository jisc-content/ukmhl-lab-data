PREFACE. 107 times undeniable, is always acknowledged with reluctance; and reafons, good or bad, are therefore always fought for, and civen for our difappointment. In the prefent cafe, a defect of circulation, an offification of veflels, a want or depravity of the nervous fluid, with fome other conjectures, equally ingenious, whimfical and groundlefs, are offered. Whatever may be the original caufe of the mortification of the toes and feet, certain it is, that acute pain is one of its firft and moft conftant fymptoms ; and as certain it is, that while fuch pain continues, no ftop is, or can be put to the progrefs of the diftemper. , The ideas of defeftive circula- tion, want of fenfibility in the nerves, of malignity, putre- faction, &c. have, in my opinion, milled us from a proper confideration of this deftructive malady, and have put us on a plan of practice, which, as far as it relates to externals, feems to me to be oppofite to that which ought to be pur- fued, and to render the difeafe more intractable, and more certainly fatal. Inftead of cooling, we endeavour to excite heat; and when the parts which yet retain life and fenfa- tion, are in fuch ftate as to be moft liable to, and fufceptible of irritation, we apply to them hot, pungent oils, balfams, and tinctures, and wrap them up in cataplafms made of fuch ingredients as are more calculated to anfwer the pur-Â«- pofe of ftimulating,' than of appeafing. In fhort, I cannot help thinking that we have, in this cafe, done what our forefathers did in that of wounds made by gun-fhot; that is, we have formed conjectures concerning the nature of the diftemper which are not true, and then have built a practice on thefe erroneous guefles. 1 The ftrange notions which our anceftors entertained con- cerning the effects of fire, the poifon of gunpowder, the malignity, and the putrefactive difpofition of gun-fttot Wounds, led them to overlook the obvious and neceflary effects of a high degree of contufion and laceration, and induced

Z2 RADICAL CURE OF THE HYDROCELE I made the experiment propofed by him, and found it fometimes fuccefsful, never hazardous, or prejudicial, but by no means certainly efficacious, or to be depended upon. The cannula, by its hardnefs and refiftance, was a very unpleafant gueft with- in the vaginal coat; and from its inflexi- bility, upon any unguarded motion of the patient, injured the teflicle, and gave very acute pain; and the tent and bougie, which I occafionally fubftituted in its place, al- though they did not give fo much pain, were liable to a confiderable degree of un- certainty. Uncertainty and hazard are certainly very different things, and the latter much pre- ferable to the former: not to have injured a man by . an experiment, affords fome de- gree of confolation under a difappointment: but yet, when it is confidered, that an ope- ration and procefs of this kind is fubmitted to from choice, and not from neceffity, if it fails of fuccefs, although no real harm be done either to the part, or to the con- stitution of the patient, both the lofs of lime and the confinement will become doubly irkfome, as they will be found not

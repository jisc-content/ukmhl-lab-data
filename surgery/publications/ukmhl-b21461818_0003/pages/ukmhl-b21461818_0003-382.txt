360 ON THE MORTIFICATION fomentation, as poultice, as dreffing; I have affifted it with every thing which has been ufually thought capable of procuring, or affifting digeftion; ftill the diftemper has continued its courfe, perhaps a little more flowly, but ftill it has ended in death. I am forry to rob one of our great me- dicines of any part of its fuppoled merit; but as on the one hand, its claim, in this inftance, is unjuft, and as on the other, I hope to add as much to the character of another, the res medica will be no fufferer. Some time ago, I had a patient labour- ing under this complaint, who, from an- tipathy, obftinacy, or ibme other caufe, could not be prevailed on to take bark in any form whatever. I made ufe of every argument, but to no purpofe : fomentation, poultice, and the ufual dreffings were ap- plied in the ufual manner; the difeafe ad- vanced ibme days more, fome days lefs, and at the end of a fortnight, the fmall toes were all completely mortified, the great one become blackifh, the foot much fwollen, altered in colour, and the difeafe feeming to advance with fuch hafty ftrides, that I fup- pofed a very few days would determine the event.

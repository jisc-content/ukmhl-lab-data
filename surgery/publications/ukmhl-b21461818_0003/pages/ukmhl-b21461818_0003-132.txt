I 14 A TREATISE ON becomes neceffary, fuch diftirfction is of no confequence at all; it makes no alteration in the degree, kind, or quantity of pain which the patient is to feel; the force required to pum the knife through the tender gut is next to none, and when its point is in the cavity, the cafes are exactly fimilar. This is the only operation which (in the circumflances under our prefent consider- ation) ever can be neceffary ; and this appears to me to be the fafeft, eafieft, and moft expeditious method of performing it. I know that it is contrary to the opinion and practice of many; who think that the removal of fome part, both of the inteftinc and of the verge of the anus, is neceffary in thefe cafes; but long and repeated experi- ence has convinced me of the contrary: and I {hall, in the next fection, have occafion to fpeak more particularly to that point. Immediately after the operation, a foft doffil of ftrfe lint mould be introduced (from the rectum; between the divided lips of the incifion; as well to reprefs any flight haemor- rhage, as to prevent the immediate re-union of the aid lips j and the reft of the fore fhould be lightly dreffed with the fame.

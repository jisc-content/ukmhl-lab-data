When' it appears after the depreffion of a firm cryf- 'talline, or after an unfuccefsful attempt to deprefs one which has proved not firm enough, it may eafily be, and generally is, . mistaken for a portion of the cataradt rifen again; but from _ which an attentive obferver will always be able to diffinguifli •it: but when fuch opacity follows what is called a fuc'cefsful i extraction, in which the cornea only was divided3 the capfula not touched by the infr.rum.ent, and" the cataradl came away ' entire through the pupil, the cafe is felt-evident. This may truly and properly be called, as it has been by -Monfieur Houin, Haller, and others, a membranous cataradt, ( as it confifts merely of the membranous capfula of the cryf- talBne. Writers of credit have mentioned, that a cataradl may be formed almoft. inftantaneoufly, by external violence. There is 'no doubt of the fadl ; 1 have feen it four different times. Whether this be' not an affedlion of the capfula merely, I 'much doubt; or rather am much inclined to fufpedr., that it moft frequently is. 1 In three of the four, which have fallen under my obfervation, tHe opacity has gradually djfappeared after the inflammation, in confequence of the blow, had gone off' and the eves were left as clear as ever. A confequence which, I think, may be accounted for, by fuppofing the opacity in the capfula only ; but cannot, if we fuppofe it to b, in the corpus f^M^um ufe^. Qn ^ <aoiftgiaB }0 „ « * lS> Clthcr'

l84 A TREATISE, &C. urethra, called fiftulae in perinaeo, require fcparate and particular confideration. In thefe, the external openings, with the finufes leading from them into the cellular membrane, are the lean: part of the complaint: the ftriclure in the ure- thra, the induration of the whole neck of the bladder, the hardened, fungous, en- larged, or ulcerated flare of the proitate gland, the difeafes of the verumontanum, of the veficulae feminales, and vafa deferentia, are the great and principal objects of confider- ation. A very ferious confideration they cer- tainly make. Great and manifold are the miferies which are derived to mankind from thefe caufesj and much' more diligent in- quiry do they deferve, than they have yet met with: but as they do not immediately belong to my prefent fubject, I rauft omit, or, at leaft, to another opportunity defer, entering into them.

334 VENEREAL DISEASE; equals in extent that which I have now detailed to you of those cases treated in the army; but I should state to you, decidedly, as the result of my own experience, that there are very few in- stances of secondary symptoms occurring, where the primary sores, of the descriptions I have already mentioned to you, were treated without mercury. It is my plan, in private practice, to employ mercury moderatelyâ€”not extensively, but moderately, in the treatment of primary syphilitic sores (excepting in the cases of sloughing and phagedenic sores), and certainly 1 have been in the habit of seeing secondary symptoms very seldom occurring in such cases ; I may, therefore, state to you, that my experience in private practice, quite accords with the inference to be drawn from the large experience exhibited by the Army Medical Board. I would state to you, then, that in the description of sores I have mentioned, I should generally administer mercury in a moderate way. In the first instance, one would clear out the alimentary canal of such patients; one would keep them as quiet as possible, put them on a moderate diet, and administer mercury moderately j three, four, or five grains of the blue pill two or three times a day, and apply the black-wash, that is calo- mel and lime-water, to the sores ; and this kind of treatment is certainly, on the average, very successful in the cases of which I am now speaking. The employment of mercury is more particularly necessary in the cases of indurated chancre; and whether the chancre pos- sesses that character originally, or whether the induration comes on subsequently, or whether the induration occurs in a secondary way, after the primary sore is healed, and shows itself simply as induration without sore, 1 think the employ- ment of mercury is equally required. We cannot consider our patients to be safe, so long as such induration remains, and I think it is desirable to use mercury in those cases, and to con- tinue the employment of it until the induration has completely disappeared. There are some instances in which sores form upon the glans, or the internal surface of the prepuce, and where the prepuce goes into a state of phimosis; so that we ascertain the exist- ence of the sore rather by the discharge that takes place from under the prepuce, than by any direct evidence of its existence. After the inflammation of the prepuce is reduced by soothing means, if the discharge continues, aod if we feel an induration on examining the prepuce externally, or if, upon handling the glans, pain is felt, we naturally conclude that a syphilitic sore is on the glans, though we cannot see it; and in such instances I think the moderate employment of mercury is proper; and

INTRODUCTORY LECTURE, 13 itself on the mind with irresistible evidence, viz., that there is no natural distinction between surgery and physic ; that they are merely parts, and inseparably united parts, of one science and art; that the practical principles rest in both on the same scientific foundation ; and that the two branches of the ptofession must, in most instances, adopt the same proceedings, because they have the same purposes to accomplish, while their occasional differences are merely unimportant modifications in the means of arriving at the same end. Thus the dis- tinction turns out, at last, to be quite arbitrary ; to depend on, and be regulated by usage ; founded in no fixed principles, and, therefore, fluctuating and uncertain, like all matters of custom. A knowledge of the structure and functions of the body is the basis of all rational medicine. Doctrines, systems, and theories, which will not bear examination by the test of ana- tomy and physiology, are only to be regarded as random guess- work, or idle dreams. No one would attempt to mend a clock, watch, steam engine, or the commonest piece of machinery, un- less he understood its construction, unless he knew,—what we may call its anatomy and physiology, that is,—the nature of the materials which compose it, the configuration, adjustment, and mutual action of the parts. Yet persons are constantly attempt- ing to rectify the disorders of the human machine, not only with aslight and vague knowledge of its construction, but even in perfect ignorance of it, although, as a piece of machinery, the human body is far more complicated than any instrument of human fabrication. No man who aspires to a scientific knowledge of his pro- fession, can neglect the sciences of anatomy and physiology, because they afford the foundation and criterion of all medical doctrines; but correct anatomical knowledge is especially necessary to the surgeon as a preparation for his ordinary duties ; without it he cannot determine the seat and nature of disease; he cannot distinguish between the affections of con- tiguous parts; he cannot understand the varied nature and appropriate treatment of injuries, such as fractures, disloca- tions, or wounds of blood-vessels and other soft pans. If you ask how much knowledge of anatomy is necessary for a surgeon, the answer is short; as much as he can get. Your study of anatomy must be general; it most embrace the whole frame, unless indeed you should know of any part which is out of the reach of injury, or exempt from the attacks of disease; or any region which can never be the subject of operation. Operations may, in some instances, be executed mecha- nically, by following certain rules ; but if things do not go on

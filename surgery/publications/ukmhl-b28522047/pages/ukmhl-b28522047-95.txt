INFLAMMATION 87 inflammation, will have shown you that this is a temporary state of a part; that is, that the condition of inflammation may arise in a part, may proceed to its full development, and may then decline and entirely disappear, and leave the part in a natural or normal state, so far as regards both its structure and its function, without any treatment at all. In this respect there is a striking contrast between inflammation or common disease, and those changes of structure that occur in some specific diseases of the body—those organic changes, as they are commonly termed, such as cancer and fungus haematodes ; for, in alterations of this nature, changes seem to be essentially destructive; they render the part quite unfit for executing its functions, and proceed till they entirely destroy the parts in which they take place. Hence has arisen the term which has been given to this peculiar kind of change—malignant. But inflammation, on the contrary, seems to have a natural ten- dency to terminate in a state in which the part is again left capable of exercising its proper functions. We must observe, however, that inflammation, when it is violent, dangerously disturbs, or even entirely suspends the function of the organ in which it takes place; consequently it is absolutely necessary that it should be quickly arrested, when it affects any organ of which the continued exertion is necessary to life, such as the brain, the heart, or the lungs; such as the larynx, the stomach, or intestines, and the contents of the cavity of the abdomen generally. When inflammation affects any of these viscera, it is quite possible that, if the action of the part could be dis- pensed with for a time, the inflammation might go through its course, and leave the organ in a state capable of exercising its functions afterwards : but the danger here arises from the want of the due performance of the function during the time that the inflammation is at its height. The regular exercise of the organ cannot be dispensed with for carrying on the purposes of life ; therefore you must stop the inflammation, to prevent the effect which otherwise would be produced in the economy, by the want of a certain effect which is absolutely and indis- pensably necessary. Again, the various effects of inflammation, particularly mor- tification, suppuration, and interstitial deposition,are capable of producing such changes in the state of an organ, as to render it, in a greater or less degree, incapable, even after the inflamma- tion has ceased, of carrying on its regular function. Even the least important of these, interstitial deposition, is capable of producing changes in an organ which will seriously and permanently impair its action. Such instertitial deposition will thicken and harden a part; it will consolidate parts natu-

356 VENEREAL DISEASE; “ Facts illustrating the effects of the Venereal Disease on the Child inUtero, by William Hey;” and it appears, from what he there states, that the disease originally arose from secondary symptoms in the mother; and I ohserve that he introduces a question, which I have also submitted to you in a former lec- ture, namely, whether syphilis can be communicated from the husband to the wife by cohabitation, when the husband labours under the secondary or constitutional form of the disease ? And he is of opinion, although he is not able to state any positive facts to support him in that opinion, that the disease may be so communicated, that the husband labouring under secondary symptoms, may, by cohabitation, communicate the disease to the wife; and I acknowledge that that also is the impression on my own mind, from the circumstances that have come under my observation. Children that have received syphilitic affections in utero, are sometimes bom with the cuticle desquamating and peeling off, all over them ; in a desperate state, weak, emaciated, and just ready to die, in fact. Such is the form in which syphilis exists at the time of birth. But more commonly the children are born healthy, and a few weeks after birth begin to exhibit symptoms of the disease;—redness of parts, excoriations, su- perficial ulcerations, and sometimes vesicles, or pustules, show themselves about the anus and the external organs of genera- tion ; and this affection, which commences in these parts of the skin soon after they are born, gradually extends all over the body; thus, in a short time, you will find that the child exhibits over the whole of it patches of a coppery-red discolo- ration of the skin, sometimes large in quantity, and sometimes small ; that those patches go into a slight scaly state, and that the cuticle desquamates or seperates from the whole of the body, sometimes without any manifest previous inflammation; but you will find it separating over the whole body, even to the palms of the hands and soles of the feet—-peeling off from the whole frame. You will see those patches of light coppery-red discoloration of the skin particularly large and vivid about the face, so that the child’s face has a nasty scabby appearance. You will observe ulcerated fissures at the corners of the mouth; aphthae of the mucous membrane of the mouth ; a soreness and raw state of the eyelids. You will find that the nostrils become inflamed, and that a thick, viscid, yellow secretion stuffs up the nares, so that the child has generally a kind of snuffling about the nose; and when you come to look at it, you will see that the nostrils are completely plugged with that thick,yellow, offensive matter. In conjunction with these symptoms, you find, as you would naturally expect, that the child loses flesh

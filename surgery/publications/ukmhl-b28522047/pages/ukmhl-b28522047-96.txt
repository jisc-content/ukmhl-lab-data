88 TREATMENT OF INFLAMMATION; rally loose in structure ; it will unite together parts which are naturally separate, and it will render parts, naturally transparent, opaque ; and these various changes may arise in consequence of inflammation not of the highest degree. When inflammation occurs in a joint, this induration and thickening may produce a stiffness of the parts, rendering the motions very imperfect. Suppose inflammation occur in the eye, or in the ear (parts naturally very delicate), a comparatively low degree of inflammation will produce such changes as will very seri- ously impair their functions. Suppose you have inflammation of the cornea, or the iris, or of the retina ; the inflammation may go through its stages without producing any very serious local symptoms, and without producing any considerable sym- pathetic effects on other parts of the economy; but you will find, in the first instance, that interstical deposition will take place in the cornea, which will obscure the aperture of the pupil, aud render vision imperfect; in the second instance you will find, if lymph be effused upon the iris, it will cause it to adhere to the capsule of the chrystalline lens, and thus impede or actually destroy the sight; you will find that the dark structure of the retina may be thickened and rendered opaque, and thus disabled for the execution of its proper functions; and, therefore, in consequence of these several changes, accord- ing to the degree in which they take place, the vision will be more or less considerably impaired. Suppose you have in- flammation affecting the hand or foot, and that it proceeds to suppuration, the skin will be rendered adherent to the tendons, the tendons will become adherent to each other, or to the sheaths containing them; perhaps some of the joints will go into a state of suppuration, and thus the motions of the part will be seriously injured. Thus, then, though the part affected may not be essential to life, it is necessary to adopt active means to arrest the inflammation, for the purpose of preventing those changes taking place, that would subsequently interfere with the function of the part; and if you are to accomplish that, you will find it necessary to adopt means quite as active in the one as in the other case; that is, you must adopt means as powerful to stop inflammation in the hand or foot, as if it were seated in the heart, in the lungs, in the brain, or in any other important part. Further, although inflammation should not be seated in a part important to life, and although there should be no immediate danger of any change involving the function of the organ, yet it is of consequence to arrest the inflammatory process, for this reason, that the longer the vessels remain overloaded, with the more difficulty will they recover their natural state, and the

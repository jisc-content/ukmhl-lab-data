30 LECTURE III. Nature and Classification of Diseases. I endeavoured, gentlemen, in my last lecture, to give you a general notion of diseases :—L represented to you that they might be defined to be a deviation from the healthy or regular state of any solid or fluid of the body, or of any fuuction ; not, however, meaning thereby that the function could be dis- ordered without a change in the condition of the organ that executed it.' With regard to the question, whether fluids could be altered without some change in the solid parts of the body, I considered it to be hitherto undecided, i spoke to you of the difference between organic and functional diseases, re- garding the former as comprehending all those cases in which some recognisable change after death is observed in the organi- zation of the part, and arranging under the latter those in- stances in which no such change can be ascertained, but in which, however, we cannot entertain a doubt tiiat a change must have occurred in the living condition of the part, as we cannot suppose that the function can he altered without some change in the state of the organ which is the cause of that function. 1 mentioned to you that I could not admit the notion of functional diseases, considered us independent of the organs by which they are exercised, as it seemed to me to in- volve the idea of an effect without a cause ; and 1 farther held this notion to be objectionable as leading to injurious practical consequences. This I attempted to illustrate from the views entertained respecting the nature of palsy, and the treatment adopted under the notion of that disease, consisting in a diminished or reduced state of the nervous power of the part. I alluded to some particulars in reference to the treatment of impaired vision ; to the notion of debility in fevers, and to the ideaof indigestion in affections of the stomach. I observed far- ther that 1 considered that all the organs of the body might be primarily diseased—that is, each organ may be disturbed by a eause which is applied to it in the execution cf its peculiar functions; next, that all the organs may be secondarily dis- eased, that is, they may be diseased in consequence of derange- ment previously existing in some other part: these two kinds of disturbance being respectively called primary and secon- dary, idiopathic and sympathetic. I observed that the words sympathy and sympathetic did not explain how the phenome-

151 LECTURE XIII. Hectic Fever—Treatment of Hectic—Mortifi- cation resumed—Its Causes, Prognosis, and Treatment. Gentlemen, having omitted in my last lecture one part of my subject, of which it was my intention to have spoken, I shall now fill up the vacuum, and prevent a dislocation of the subject. Hectic Fever—The constitutional disturbance which takes place when inflammation arises in the cyst of a chronic abscess, and when copious and continued suppuration occurs, has obtained the name of hectic fever. Hectic fever is a disturb- ance of the system, arising from the weakness occasioned by long-continued and serious local disease, more especially when such local disease is attended with suppuration. Hence it has been sometimes called suppurative fever, though that name would be objectionable, because suppuration very commonly occurs without any symptom of hectic fever, whilst, on the other hand, hectic fever may take place where there is no sup- puration. Hectic fever occurs in various medical as well as surgical cases. In extensive pulmonary disease of a tubercular character, though the disease may not have proceeded to the extent of suppuration, you may have all the symptoms of hectic, and in an affection of some important joint of the body, in which the formation of matter may not have taken place, hectic may have occurred. After a serious injury, such as a bad compound fracture, violent inflammation of the limb will generally supervene, and, in conjunction with this serious local disturbance, there is a corresponding inflammatory fever; matter forms in consequence of the inflammation, and a pallia- tion of the symptoms succeeds; there will be a recurrence of the inflammation, fresh purulent collections will take place, and fresh frebile symptoms accompany them; in this way the strength of the patient becomes considerably reduced, and, after a length of time, the local disturbance becomes altered ; the limb is no longer swelled, red, and the seat of successive phlegmonous abscesses, but it is, perhaps, shrunk in size ; cedematous, instead of having the firm swelling which charac- terizes phlegmonous inflammation, and probably a profuse dis- charge of thin matter takes place. Together with this change

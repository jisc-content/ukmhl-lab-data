1.92 GANGRENE. 1. The gangrene, which is produced by the action of caustic, or fire, is always attended with an actual decomposition of the flesh. Sometimes, indeed, as we have explained in treating of burns, the caloric, which is applied, being below a certain degree, does not directly kill and decompose the part, does not imme- diately occasion a slough ; but excites such in- flammation, as afterwards terminates in this sort of mischief. Having spoken of burns, it becomes unnecessaryKto dwell upon them any more here. 2. The abstraction of caloric is not less per- nicious than the application of too high de- grees of it. These very opposite causes, in fact, are observed to give rise to effects, which much resemble each other. Exposure to cold, like the application of heat, may excite differ- ent degrees of injury, from a slight inflamma- tion of a part, to the death ol the yhole body. When the cold docs not exceed a certain in- tensity, such complaints as inflamed, or ul- cerated chilblains, are produced. hen the cold, to which parts have been exposed, is greater, gangrene is apt to be excited. Lastly, when the whole body is subjected to the de- structive influence of excessive cold, a sense of lassitude overwhelms the system, a danger-

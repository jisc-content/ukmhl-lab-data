AMPUTATION'. 30 strong garter, to the nearest leg of tlie table, while an assistant is firmly to hold the diseased limb by grasping it near the knee. 3. The tourniquet is to be applied with its pad on the femoral artery, as high up as can be well contrived. 4. The surgeon, with the large-sized ampu- tating knife in his hand, is to stand on the right of the patient. 5. By placing his arm under the limb, he is enabled to begin the first incision upon that portion of the upper surface of the member, which is nearest him, and to conduct the knife, with one quick stroke, all round the member, so as to complete the circular cut through the integuments. 6. This incision is to be made, while an assistant grasps the thigh above with both his hands, and draws upward the integuments. 7. The cellular substance, connecting the fascia and skin, is now to be divided to an extent sufficient to. allow about two inches of the integuments to be separated from the muscles all round, drawn up and saved to cover the end of the stump. 8. The edge of the knife is now to be applied, under the margin of the supported integuments, upon the inner edge of the vastus interims muscle (supposing it to be the right thigh).

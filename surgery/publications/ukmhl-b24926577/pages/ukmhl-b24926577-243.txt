HERNIA. 235 from the posterior edge of Poupart s ligament to the back surface of the transverse muscle. The abdominal ring is strictly to be regarded as the lower, or outer opening of a canal, for the passage of the spermatic cord through the parietes of the abdomen. The upper, or inner opening of this canal, which is the place where the spermatic cord first enters the passage, and the point at which a hernia first quits the abdomen, is situated about an inch and an half, in the direction upwards and outwards, from the pubes towards the spine of the ilium. The canal extends obliquely between this inner opening and the ring, being closed in front by the aponeurosis of the external oblique, and behind by the fascia transversalis. The epi- gastric artery arises from the external iliac, runs obliquely upwards and inwards, along the inner margin of the internal opening of the canal, and then passes about half an inch, or an inch, from the upper extremity of the abdominal ring, in its course to the posterior surface of the rectus muscle. The foregoing anatomical cir- cumstances only differ in the female, inasmuch as the round ligament of the uterus takes the place of the spermatic cord, and the ring is smaller than in male subjects. In common bubonoceles, the viscera quit the abdomen at the inner opening of the canal, pass under the

28 ACHILLES, TENDON OF, RUPTURED.- , TREATMENT. The indication is, to put the separated ends of the tendon into contact, and to keep them so, till an union has taken place. With this view, the knee is to be moderately bent, and the foot completely extended. The ends of the tendon are then to be put as near to each other As possible. The hollows, in front of the ten- don, on each side, are to be filled with com- presses of soft lint, so as to hinder the bandage from pressing the ends of the ruptured part too far inward. A long narrow compress is then to be applied from the toes, along the sole of the foot, over the heel and calf of the leg, to above the ham. This compress is lastly to be bound on the limb with a roller, the application of which is to begin at the toes, be made round the ankle in the form of a figure of 8, and be continued up as high as the compress ex- tends. Various mechanical contrivances have been used for keeping the foot extended, and such must be had recourse to, if the patient gets up. The main part of each apparatus is a strap, with which the heel is buckled up as Tar atf circumstances require. For some time after the tendon has been ynited, it will be prudent to wear a high-heeled shoe.

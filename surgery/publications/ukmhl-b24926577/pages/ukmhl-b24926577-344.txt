ULCERS OF THE LEGS*. 336 TREATMENT. 1. In general, rest and a horizontal position of the limb materially promote the cure of all ulcers of the leg, whether recent or invete- rate, particularly, when the sores have made considerable progress, in consequence of too much exercise, or labour. £. Since the ulcers are, on their first being placed under surgical treatment, often in a foul, inflamed, or sloughy state, it is a good general rule to begin with employing, for the few first days, emollient poultices, under which may be laid on the sore a small quantity of soft lint. However, when the ulcer is exceed- ingly painful, the lint may be omitted. 3. If the alimentary canal be disordered, as is often the case at first, mild purgatives, and even an emetic, will be of great service. 4. After a few days, the inflamed and sloughy state of the sore will generally have disappeared, its hard prominent edges subsided, and its size undergone a vast diminution. Relaxing poul- tices are now to be discontinued, and dressings applied. 5. Soft lint may then be put on the sore, and covered with a pledget of Turner’s cerate. In the course of two, or three days, the sur- face of the ulcer may be sprinkled with a little of the pulv. myrrhae et lapid. calami**. before

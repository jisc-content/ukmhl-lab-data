DISLOCATIONS. 120 bone upwards and backwards are more uncom- mon : from the superficial situation of the end of the bone, the diagnosis is easy ; and the same treatment is required as in the foregoing in- stance. Luxations of the scapulary end of the clavicle are very unfrequent. They are prevented by the strong ligaments, which tie the clavicle to the scapula; and it is only when these are ruptured, that the first bone can slip over the acromion. Falls on the shoul- der, aided by a violent spasm of the trapezius muscle, may occasion the accident. The case may be known by the deformity of the shoulder, the pain, the impossibility of moving the arm, &c. The reduction is accomplished by keep- ing the shoulder backwards, as is done in the treatment of a broken clavicle. A perfect cure is said to be difficult, owing to the tendency of the bone to slip out of its place again, after having once done so. However, a slight w eak- ness of the arm is the only inconvenience arising from the circumstance. 2. Dislocations of the humerus would be far more frequent, if it were not followed in all its motions by that \ery moveable bone, the scapula. Anatomical obstacles prevent a luxa- tion up wauls; it is possible, but rare, back- wards; it happens forwards only seldom; it pecurs almost always downwards. The latter

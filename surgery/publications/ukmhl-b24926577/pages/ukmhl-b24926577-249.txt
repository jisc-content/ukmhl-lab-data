A dark brown, or chocolate colour of the in- testine, does not evince that it is actually mor- tided. The blood in its veins ntay still be urged forwards by pressure. In gangrene, the part is quite black, and gives way under the finger. The omentum, when, mortified or dis- eased, also requires, as well as a gangrenous portion of intestine, particular treatment. When the hernial contents are adherent to each other, or the sac, the adhesions, if recent and slight, may be broken with the finger; if old and strong, they must be cautiously divided with the knife. After reducing the parts, sur- geons make it an invariable maxim to assure themselves, that the viscera are freely within the abdomen, by passing their finger through the ring into the cavity of the peritoneum. A surgeon who exercises manual roughness or force, in any part of this operation, is totally unfit for his office. The preceding method of operating would not be proper in many large, old, adherent hernia?, on account of the diffi- culty of separating all the adhesions, the vio- lence unavoidable in such an attempt, the ex- tensive exposure, the occasional impossibility of keeping the returned parts in the abdomen, R

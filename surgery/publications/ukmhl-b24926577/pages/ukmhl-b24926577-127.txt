119 DISLOCATIONS. jjtticular sort, as those of the clavicle, of the jjrradius from the ulna, of the kneepan, anti uof the fibula from the tibia. When the luxated head of a bone is pro- jjttruded through the skin, or when the case is {{joined with an external wound leading into the | capsular ligament of the joint, the dislocation I is termed compound, and is far more perilous, ['than when simple. What we shall have to i 'say of compound fractures will, for the most i 5 part, be applicable to compound dislocations. There being immense diversity in the nature and treatment of dislocations, it is necessary I to treat of each case separately. l. Fractures of the clavicle are estimated to happen six times as often as luxations, to which both its ends are liable. The sternal end may be dislocated forwards, upwards, and backwards; but, never downwards, the accident being pre- vented in that direction by the cartilage of the first rib. The luxation forwards is the most common, and is readily known by the pro- jection, under the skin, in front of the sternum; by the unnatural direction of the clavicle; by pain, the dragging of the stemo-cleido-mastoi- deus muscle, and by the inclination of the head towards the affected shoulder. This case de- mands similar treatment to that of a fractured clavicle. Luxations of the sternal end of this l 4

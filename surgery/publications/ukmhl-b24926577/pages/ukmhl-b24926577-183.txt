Violent coughing must also be appeased by opiates. 12. Compound fractures of the limbs are highly dangerous cases, and such as often call for the exertion of the utmost surgical skill and judgment. The existence of a wound, which leads down to the fracture, makes a most material difference in the nature of the case. Without this breach in the soft parts, there is in general no severe degree of fever, no suppuration, no danger of gangrene; and under the observance of a proper position, and strict quietude, the bones, being kept steady in splints, unite very well at the end of a certain time. But, when the fracture has a wound leading down to it, the peril, difficulty of cure, and severity of the symptoms, are all much increased.

There are many instances, however, in which the most judicious and experienced surgeons feel embarrassed as to the proper line of conduct, whether the limb should be cut off at once, or an effort be made to save it.

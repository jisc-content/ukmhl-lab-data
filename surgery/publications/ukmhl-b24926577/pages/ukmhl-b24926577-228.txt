HERNIA* 220 integuments, the sac having been burst by external violence. Excepting the hernia con- genita, hernia of the bladder, and, perhaps, cases following wounds of the belly, or recur- ring after the operation, all ruptures have an hernial sac, that is to say, a covering of peri- toneum. The contents of the sac are gene- rally omentum, or intestines, which are the most moveable viscera in the abdomen. The small intestine, called ilium, being very near the ring, is particularly often protruded. Of the large intestines, the caecum, and sigmoid flexure of the colon, are the most apt to form a hernia. In proportion as the hernial tumor grows larger, the parts, already protruded, may drag out others, until nearly all the vis- cera of the abdomen have become displaced. Besides omentum and intestine, the bladder, ovaries, uterus, spleen, and stomach, have been known, in less common cases, to compose the contents of a hernia. The groin, scrotum, labia pudendi, bend of the thigh, and navel, are the most frequent situation of ruptures. When the viscera lie just within the canal of the abdominal ring, or have descended quite into the groin, the case is called a bubonocele, or inguinal hernia. When the bowels have passed still further down, so as to get into the scrotum, the case is named an oscheocele, or

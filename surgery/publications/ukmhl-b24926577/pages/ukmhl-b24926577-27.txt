ABSCESSES. 19 c 2 always be drawn oftâ€™ by suction, or with cup- ping-glasses. In this way, the progress of the inflammation to suppuration might often be stop- ped. The use of leeches should never be omit- ted. 2. These cases being attended with severe pain, opiates are generally necessary. 3. When the inflammation has risen to a cer- tain pitch, the formation of matter cannot be prevented, and the surgeon is obliged to be con- tent with merely applying emollient poultices. 4. Milk abscesses sometimes give rise to ob- stinate ill-looking sores, which put on a very malignant aspect, and resist all plans of treat- ment. They are mostly owing to too early and large an opening having been made in the abscess. In these cases, it is a general maxim of the highest importance, not to make an open- ing, before most of the hardness is gone, and to do this by the mere puncture of a lancet. No troublesome consequences will then ensue; and the opening will heal in a few days. 5. Sometimes, elevated parts of the swelling present a thin shining appearance of the skin, threatening to burst. When much hardness yet exists, these places ought to be covered with compresses wet with the saturnine lotion, so as to protract for a time their bursting, and keep the poultice from coining into contact with them.

Bv Samuel Cooper, Member of the Royal College of Surgeons in London. In one neat and very closely printed Volume. 8vo. 15s. “ The style of this work is clear and perspicuous ; the observations are confined to practical points, references are made to the best authors, and the quotations from them are selected with much judgment; we know of no publication in which so much practical instruction, and so large a share of the doctrines of the best writers, are compiesscd within such a narrow compass. To the Student, therefore, who requires a system of Surgery, w’e do not believe that he can provide himself with any that will prove more useful to him than Mi.

HERNIA. â€¢54 ultimately inefficacious. With respect to the applications to the tumor itself, the plan of filling bladders with pounded ice, tying them up, and laying them on the hernia, is what is most strongly recommended by surgeons of expe- rience. When ice cannot be obtained, cold mixtures, made with vinegar and the muriate of ammonia, and solutions of nitre and common salt, and put into bladders, may be used. The topical application of cold, and the injection of tobaeco-ctysters, form together the most powerful means of reduction, independently of the operation, While a trial of them is made, gentle manual attempts are not to be omitted. Warm poultices and fomentations have sunk into contempt, among all well informed sur- geons. 4. Supposing the best of the foregoing methods to have failed, the operation ought to be immediately performed; before describing it, some anatomical circumstances claim atten- tion. In the bubonocele, the viscera descend in the direction of the spermatic cord, towards the abdominal ring, out of which opening they are generally protruded. The ring has been erroneously imagined to be shut up behind merely by the peritoneum, while, in reality, there exists in such situation a thin aponeurosis-, called the fascia transversal^, which is extended

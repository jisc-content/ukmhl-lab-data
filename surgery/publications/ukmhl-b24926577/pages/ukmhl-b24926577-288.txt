LITHOTOMY. Â£80 pubis. When the hemorrhage proceeds from the rperineal artery, it is more or less consi- derable, in proportion to the very variable size of this vessel in different subjects. The blood issues from a point near the lower angle of the incision, and from the inferior part of its exter- nal lip. When the artery of the bulb is cut, the blood does not flow so profusely, and comes from the upper angle of the wound. When the internal pudendal itself is wounded, a copious hemorrhage happens from a deep point of the outer side of the incision. The artery of the bulb can only be cut by beginning the incision too high, which is a material fault in operating, as the opening into the bladder not being then made as direct as possible, much difficulty is apt to be experienced in extracting the stone. The commencement of the wound should never be more than two thirds of an inch from the anus. The trunk of the internal pudendal can only he wounded bv carrying the incision to an unreasonable extent, and in a direction too much inclined towards the rami of the ischium. Nothing can he a greater error than preferring a gorget, with its edge turned obliquely upwards. An inci- sion in this direction is, of all others, the most upt to injure the foregoing vessel, while, owing to the maimer in which the rami of the ischium

DISLOCATIONS. 127 Anchylosis is also very apt to follow dislo- 11cations inwards, or outwards, which fwtunately jhare not frequent, and never complete. The [(diagnosis and reduction are too simple to need It explanation. Bleeding, cold washes, and anti- j; phlogistic remedies, must not be neglected. When the prone, or supine motion of the jji hand is executed with violence, and to too great i, an extent, the upper head of the radius may be forced out of the little sigmoid cavity of t the ulna, forwards, or backwards. The luxa- lition backwards is the most frequent. The ihand is fixed in a very prone position, and can- mot be moved into the supine one. The head pof the radius forms a tumor on the outside of the olecranon, and a depression may be felt â€¢below the external tuberosity of the humerus. ; In reducing this case, the patient's elbow is to be taken hold of, and his hand is to be moved |* into the supine position, at the same time that : the head of the bone is pushed from behind i forwards. The luxation forwards is less com- mon, though possible. The hand is found fixed ! in the supine posture. The reduction is effected 111 by moving the hand in the contrary direction, ; and pressing the head of the bone from before j backwards. A violent wrench of the wrist may dislo- cate the lower end of the radius off the ulna.

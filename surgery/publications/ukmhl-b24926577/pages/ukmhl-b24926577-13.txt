. 5 ABSCESSES. This is seldom advantageous; perhaps never in cases of acute abscesses. It is more painful than the use of the knife or lancet, uncertain in its effect, and productive of a large scar, which would be highly objectionable in many situa- tions. A few abscesses attended with much indu- ration at their circumference, and an imperfect indolent kind of suppuration, may perhaps ad- mit of this method. Here it may do good upon the principle of quickening the action of the vessels in the hardened parts around the matter. Upon the whole, however, we entertain an un- favourable opinion of the plan. 4. A third way of opening abscesses is by means of a seton, which is passed through a por- tion of the side of the cavity containing the matter: this plan is never proper in acute ab- scesses: it came into vogue from a fear of allow- ing all the matter to escape at once, which cer- tainly seems to have been attended with alarming and fatal effects in Some large chronic abscesses. Ilut it is only to these last cases that a seton is at all applicable; and its having sometimes been advised, for phlegmonous acute abscesses has altogether proceeded from error and want of discrimination. 5. Poultices are the common and best appli- cations to acute abscesses, both before, and for some time after an opening has either taken place â€¢ p. 3

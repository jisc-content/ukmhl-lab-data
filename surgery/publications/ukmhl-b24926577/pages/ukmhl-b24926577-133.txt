DISLOCATIONS. 125 toe primitive, when, in a fall upon the elbow, tthis part, besides being separated from the trunk, iis also inclined backwards. This case is re- priced in the same way, as the luxation down- juwards, with this slight difference, that as the elbow inclines outwards and backwards, the extension is at first to be made in the direc- tion of the luxated bone, and, afterwards, .when the head of the bone is disengaged, the elbow is to be inclined forwards and in- wards. In order to keep the bone from slipping out joof its socket, after the reduction, the elbow iis to be confined close to the side with a roller, tthe fore-arm is to be supported in a sling, and aa piece of the emplastrum saponis is to be put ton the shoulder, and be retained there with uhe spica-bandage. 3. The radius and ulna may both be pushed i together, off the lower end of the humerus, 'either forwards or backwards, inwards or out- wards. The dislocation backwards is the most frequent. The olecranon ascends behind the lower head of the humerus, while the coro- *.noid process slips into the cavity destined for the reception of the olecranon. The last pro- cess mounts up higher than the internal and fexternal condyles, the arm is half bent, and wannot be extended without great pain. Sur-

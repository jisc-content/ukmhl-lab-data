DISLOCATIONS. 13a bulum, the strength of the orbicular ligament, and the existence of the ligamentum teres, the thigh-bone is liable to be dislocated from the ossa innominata. Its head may be thrown up- wards and backwards, upon the dorsum of the ilium; upwards anti inwards, upon the os pubis; downwards and forwards, upon the obturator foramen; or downwards and backwards, upon the os ischium. Of these four species of dis- location, such as happen upwards and out- wards, or downwards and inwards, are the most frequent. Every thing conspires to fa- cilitate the last form of the accident* The inner and lower part of the acetabulum has a deep notch in it; there the orbicular ligament has least strength; the ligamentum teres makes no resistance to such displacement; the head of the bone may slip upon the obturator fo- ramen, without the latter ligament being at all ruptured; and, lastly, abduction is one of the most extensive movements, of which the thigh is capable. No anatomical reasons, on the other hand, can be assigned# for the fre- quency of luxations upwards and backwards. In this direction, the brim of the acetabulum is higher, and the orbicular ligament thicker and stronger, than any where else. In a fall from some height, upon one of the knees, inclined forwards and inwards, the head

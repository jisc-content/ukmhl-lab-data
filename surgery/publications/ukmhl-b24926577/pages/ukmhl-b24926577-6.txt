n - iv PREFACE. The student will here find a short, but correct, statement of the symptoms, t causes, and treatment of a large num- ber of the most important surgical diseases; and the Practitioner will meet with an interesting series of plain and rational rules, which will guide him in the anxious scene of actual practice, with equal honour to himself, and advan- tage to such of the afflicted as are neces- sitated to seek the aid of Surgery. In short,, it is hoped, that this Work will prove, in every respect, an accurate epitome of the modern practice of Sur- gery, according to the present and most approved principles.

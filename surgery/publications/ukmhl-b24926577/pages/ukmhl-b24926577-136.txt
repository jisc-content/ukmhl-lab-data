DISLOCATIONS. IÂ£8 The accident happens most frequently for- wards ; the hand is fixed in a very prone po- sition ; and the two bones of the fore-arm cross very, obliquely. In die luxation backwards, the palm of the hand is turned upwards, the wrist deformed, and the lore-arm half bent. The first case is reduced, by an assistant hold- ing the fore-arm, while the surgeon draws the hand into its natural posture. The last case requires the elbow to be held, while extension is applied to the hand, which is at the same time to be moved into the mid-state between pronation and supination. 4. The hand may be dislocated from the lower ends of the radius and ulna, backwards or forwards, outwards or inwards. The two last accidents are the most uncommon. Luxa- tions backwards are apt to be produced by falls on the back of the hand, while this is much bent. The preternaturally bent state of the hand, the impossibility of extending it, and the deformity of the wrist, clearly show what has happened. The reduction is easily accom- plished, by the surgeon pulling towards him- self the hand, while an assistant holds the elbow, and, by making pressure upon the carpus, to force it into its natural cavity again. The dislocation forwards may happen from a fall on the palm, while the hand is strongly

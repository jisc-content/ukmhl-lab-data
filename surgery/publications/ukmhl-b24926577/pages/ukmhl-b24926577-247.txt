HERNIA. 239, raised with the forceps, and divided with the knife, the edge of which should be inclined horizontally. A small opening having been made in the sac, a director is to be introduced, by means of which and a curved bistoury the sac is to be slit open up to the ring. The return of the protruded viscera may sometimes be now accomplished without dividing the stric- ture. However, rather than use the least vio- lence for this purpose, the surgeon ought always to make the necessary use of the knife. He should gently introduce his finger into the neck of the sac, in order to feel where the incarce- ration is seated. A director is then to be passed under the stricture, which is to be divided with a curved probe-pointed bistoury. In conse- quence of the proximity of the epigastric artery to the mouth of the sac, the direction, in which this incision is made, is a matter of high import- ance. When the hernia passes, as it commonly does, through the upper opening of the abdo- minal canal, the cut should be made upwards and outwards. But, in the less frequent instance, in which the hernia is, what has been termed, vcntro-inguinal, the incision ought to be made upwards and inwards. Thus Cho- part and Desault used very properly to cut upwards and outwards, when the spermatic cord was behind, or on the inside of the sac:

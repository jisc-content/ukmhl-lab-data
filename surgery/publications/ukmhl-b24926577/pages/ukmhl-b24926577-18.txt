10 ABSCESSES. 3. Sometimes the case exhibits, what has been termed a gangrenous suppuration, in which the cellular membrane is affected in the same way as it is in the disease called carbuncle. The skin is of a dusky red, or purple kind of colour, and, although harder than in a natural state, yet it has not that degree of tension, which occurs in the two preceding cases. The patient has generally at first, a hard, full, jarring pulse, with great thirst, or very fatiguing rest- lessness. If the progress of the disease be not stopped, or the patient relieved by medicine, the pulse soon changes into an unequal, low, fal- tering one; and the strength and the spirits sink in such manner, as to imply great and im- mediately impending mischief. The matter, formed under the skin so altered, is small in quantity, and bad in quality; and the cellular membrane is sloughy throughout the extent of the discolouration. The patient’s habit is al- most always bad, or has been rendered so by in- temperance. Besides the affection of the skin, and cellular membrane about the anus, in these three differ- ent cases, the patient often suffers other com- plaints—retention of urine, strangury, dysury, bearing down, tenesmus, piles, diarrhoea, or ob- stinate eostivencss.

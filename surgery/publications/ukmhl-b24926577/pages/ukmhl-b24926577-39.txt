f â€¢ AMPUTATION'. 31 which, with the adjacent muscles, is to be cut obliquely through, upwards as to the limb, and down to the bone, so as to lay the latter part bare, about three inches higher than would be done by a perpendicular incision. The operator is next to draw the knife towards him; and, with its point resting upon the bone, and its edge kept in the same oblique position, the rest of the muscles are to be divided in that direc- tion all round the limb, the point of the knife being in contact with, and revolving round, the bone, through the whole of the division. y. The soft parts being divided, the bone remains to be sawn. The assistant is now to take a piece of linen, about fifteen inches lono-, and ten broad, which he is to slit from one end to its middle. This is called a retractor, and is intended to keep the fiesh out of the way of the saw. The bone is received in the slit, and the ends, being pulled up by the assistant, hold the skin and muscles out of the way of the teeth of the other instrument. 10. The sawing is to be executed by long, bold, yet not hasty nor heavy sweeps; and the application of the instrument should commence, by placing the back end of it on the bone, when the operator is to make the first motion Uv drawing the saw towards him, from its heel nearly to its point. This makes a furrow, which

Most of them are oval, and more or less flattened; their surface may be smooth and rounded, or unequal and rough. Calculi, which are full of asperities, must greatly irritate the bladder, and excite acute pain. The generality of urinary stones are hard and resistent; sometimes they crumble to pieces on the least pressure, and are con- verted into mere grits. The learned investi- gations of Fourcroy and Vauquelin have proved, that the uric acid, the urate of ammo- nia, the phosphate of lime, the ammoniaco- magnesian phosphate, the oxalate of lime, si- lica, and a particular modification of animal matter, are the materials of which calculi are formed. 2. Stones in the bladder usually lie quite loose in the cavity of this organ, their situation being determined by their own weight, and the contractions of the viscus in which they are contained. In a few examples, they are found to he adherent to the bladder, and to be fixed in the particular place where they happen to be situated. This state of a calculus may arise in three manners : .The stone may have been formed in a pouch, consisting of a pro-

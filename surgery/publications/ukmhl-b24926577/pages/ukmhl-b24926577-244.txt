HERNIA. 236 margin of the internal oblique and transverse muscle, go through the canal, and make a pro- trusion at the abdominal ring. In this course, they carry with them the production of perito- neum constituting the hernial sac. Although, in the natural state, and in recent herniae, the inner opening of the canal is about an iuch and a half nearer the spine of the ilium, than the ring is, yet in old cases the former aperture is so dilated by the pressure of the viscera, that it becomes more and more approximated to the latter, rendering the passage into the abdomen more direct. The bubonocele lies over the spermatic vessel, the sac, however, being co- vered by the cremaster muscle, sheath of the cord, and some tendinous fibres derived from the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle. As the hernia descends further, it lies in front of the cord, and of the testicle and its cover- ings. In some unusual instances, the cord has been seen in front of the sac by Le Dran, Schmucker, and Blizard. A. Cooper, Pott, and Camper notice the vas deferens being occasion- ally on one side of the sac, and the rest of the spermatic vessels on the other. Camper and Hey mention the vas deferens being situated before, and the other vessel behind the sac. According to Cooper and Camper, the sperma- tic vessels m?y lie before, and the vas. deferens i...

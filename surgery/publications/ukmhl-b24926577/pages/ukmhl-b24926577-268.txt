£60 HYDROCELE. by exciting such an inflammation of the cavity, in which the fluid collects, as leads to its abo- lition, by the tunica albuginea and tunica vagi- nalis becoming* every where adherent together. This is the commonly received opinion, though Mr. Ramsden has lately maintained, that no obliteration of the above cavity usually happens. After discharging the fluid, as already related, the requisite degree of inflammation is to be excited, by introducing a mixture of about two parts of port wine, and one of warm water, into the cavity of the tunica vaginalis. This •is done by means of an elastic gum syringe, with a separate pipe, one end of which is made to fit the cannula of the trocar, and the other the neck of the elastic bottle. The pipe is furnished with a valvular contrivance, which hinders the injection from regurgitating. The tunica vaginalis is to be distended with the injection, which is to be left in about live minutes. The pipe is then to be taken away, and the lotion he completely discharged tlirough the cannula. A piece of soap-plaster rs to be put over the puncture, and the scro- tum is to be kept up with a suspensory. When the testicle begins to inflame, an emollient poultice is to be applied. In case a hydrocele should be very large, the patient should at first he content with having the fluid let out.

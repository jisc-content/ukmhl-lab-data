NECROSIS. 287 which are transmitted to them through the periosteum, inflame and swell, a separation is established between the dead and living por- tions, and purulent matter collects between them. A necrosis, thus produced in the middle of the long bones, never extends to their arti- cular surfaces. The external bony lamime form round the dead portion a canal of greater or lesser diameter, while the increased size of the bone, and the vast projection of its processes, occasion so considerable an alteration in its shape, that it can hardly be recognised as an original part. As the disorder advances, the pus, collected in the place where the sepa- ration is accomplished, becomes more and more copious, very little of it being taken up by the absorbents. In this circumstance, it presses against the external lamina? which compose the bony canal, and leads to the formation of apertures in it; which become fistula?, after an opening has been made, either by art or natures, in the abscess under the skin. A probe may be introduced, through such a fistula, so a$ to touch the dead portion of bone; whereby the surgeon can often discover how far the process of separation has advanced. When the dead piece is moveable in the canal formed by the external bony lamella?, it no longer has any connexion with the living hone. The disease

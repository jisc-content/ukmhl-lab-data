CATARACT. JOS vision. The absorbents will in time take away the fragments of the broken lens; and, should they not do so, in a moderate time, couching may be safely repeated. When the cataract is fluid, or milky, the chief object of the surgeon is to lacerate and break the capsule, as much as he can do with safety. When the cataract is of the secondary, membranous kind, the prin- cipal thing in view, is to break the opaque membrane, and push the fragments from the pupil. Scarpa, with his curved needle, uses its Hat convex surface for depressing firm cata- racts; and its sharp edges for cutting caseous cataracts into pieces. The point he sometimes turns forward, towards the pupil, for the purpose of forcing through it the opaque frag- ments, which are said to be more quickly absorbed in the anterior chamber of the aqueous humor. lie also turns the point forward to pierce and tear membranous cataracts. In introducing the curved needle, the point is to be turned backward towards the centre of the vitreous humor. Whatever needle is used, or plan pursued, the principal cautions requisite in couching are, not to injure the ciliary processes and iris, and not to attempt too much at a time. The operation always admits of being repeated with safety. For a few days after couching, tlie eye must be covered with a compress, wet

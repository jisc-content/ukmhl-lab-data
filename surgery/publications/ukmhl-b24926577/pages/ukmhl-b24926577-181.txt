The first object in the treatment is to place the origins and insertions of the ex- tensor muscles as near as possible to each other. This is done by laying the patient on his back, with the leg extended on the thigh, and the latter a little bent on the pelvis; which position is to be maintained by forming a gradually as- cending surface, by means of pillows, from the buttock to the heel. The limb will lie more steadily in a fracture-box. The upper frag- ment is then to be pushed downwards, as near as possible to the lower one, and be kept from ascending again by a few turns of a roller im- mediately above it. The lower fragment can- not descend, as long as the leg is fixed in the extended posture; and, therefore, no bandage is necessary below this piece of the broken bone. The saturnine lotion should be applied to the knee. ]0. Fractures of the olecranon are attended with a retraction of the detached fragment. The fore-arm is to be extended; the fragment pushed down, and kept there, with a roller,

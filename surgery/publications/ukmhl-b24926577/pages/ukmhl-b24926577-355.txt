It might be alleged, that the caustic is quite useless, if mercury is to be used, since the chiet object of destroying the sore is to remove all occa- sion for this mineral, and, that it the latter remedy is to be employed, the chancre will heal without the caustic. Nor can the caustic make any difference in the quantity ot mer- cury, which may be required, because, accord- ing to received opinions, the effects of the dis- ease are not in a ratio to the quantity of virus absorbed. Yet, the plan has this great advan- tage, it may sometimes completely prevent the absorption of any of the virus at all; and though mercury is then given unnecessarily, the pa- tient has a double security against the exten- sion of the disease to his constitution. 11. Ever since the time of Berenger of Carpi, who is said by Douglas to have been the first, who ascertained the efficacy of mer- cury in the cure of the venereal disease, this metal in its reguline state has been well known to possess no medicinal virtue. Its power of acting against disease only exists, when it is in the state of a salt or oxide. Its prepa- rations also have different degrees of efficacy. 12. The most active of all the preparations of mercury is the oxygenated muriate, the

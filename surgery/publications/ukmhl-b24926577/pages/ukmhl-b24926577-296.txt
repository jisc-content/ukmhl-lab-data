Many months, and even years, may elapse, ere the case has made the foregoing progress; and, until this happens, a surgeon can do little more than await the opportunity of being materially useful. Expe- rience has proved, that, in this stage of necro- sis, it is not in our power to accelerate the operations of nature. The separation of tire dead bone cannot be expedited by any topical applications whatsoever, either emollients or stimulants; unless, indeed, it be true, that, in this instance, as well as in others, the action of the absorbents may be quickened, by applying a blister, and keeping it open with the savine ce- rate.

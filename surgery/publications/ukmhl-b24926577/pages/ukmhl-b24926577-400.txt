392 WOUNDS. exact direction of the thrust, and of obtaining: a sight of the instrument. Also, when a probe will pass into the wound for a certain distance, perpendicularly, at a point, where the parietes are not thick, it is concluded, that the injury extends into the abdominal cavity. But, it must not be inferred, that the wound certainly does not penetrate, because a probe cannot be thus introduced. In fact, the layers of mus- cular fibres not bearing precisely the same re- lations, which they did at the moment of the accident, soon stop the passage of the probe. When the wound is oblique, a probe can scarcely be made to trace its course. Besides, this instrument causes irritation and pain, and, by disturbing a clot of blood, may renew hemorrhage, or lead to an extravasation in the cellular membrane. The suggestion has been made to inject a mucilaginous liquid, the pas- sage of which into the belly will unquestion- ably evince that the wound penetrates. Such fluid, however, might not pass into the abdo- men, even though the wound penetrated, for the layers of muscular fibres are liable to â€¢/ change their relative position. The liquid might onl}' be injected into the cellular sub- stance, and lead the surgeon to suppose, that the wound penetrates, when it actually may

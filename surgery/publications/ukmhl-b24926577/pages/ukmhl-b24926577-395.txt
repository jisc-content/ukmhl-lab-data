387 WOUNDS. c c 2 With respect to that, which has already insi- nuated itself, some theoretical authors have talked of drawing it out with a syringe; but, besides the difficulty of accomplishing such a design, the plan is useless, as the air is always absorbed. It sometimes happens, that, in pene- trating wounds of the chest, the lung does not collapse, notwithstanding a patent opening is made in the parietes of the thorax. This cir- cumstance occurs, when the lung is adherent to the pleura Costal is at the wounded point. Of course, the lung is almost sure to be injured in such a case. Here the treatment should consist of light superficial unirritating dressings, copious bleedings, low diet, acid beverages, &c. The air and blood, which escape from a wounded lung, cannot always readily pass outwards through the solution of continuity in the parietes of the thorax. Hence arise extravasations of air and blood. The first of these cases is elsewhere considered. (See Em- physema.) Extravasations of blood in the chest do not invariably depend upon an injury of the lungs. A mere wound of one of the intercostal arteries may give rise to the accident, when the injury is so situated, that the blood can more readily flow inwards, than outwards. However, whether the extravasation proceed from the lungs, or from the parietes of the chest,

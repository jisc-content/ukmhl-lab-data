238 HERNIA. the disease may be known by the swelling having begun above, aad gradually descended towards the scrotum ; by the inability of feel- ing the spermatic cord; by the testicle being perceptible behind the tumor; conjoined with the symptoms of hernia already described.â€” The operation for a strangulated bubonocele consists in making an incision through the inte- guments, dissecting down to the sac, and open- ing it, and replacing the protruded viscera. In the operation for common cases, the first incision should begin an inch above the exter- nal angle of the ring, and be continued down to the lower part of the swelling. By this cut, the external pubic branch of the femoral artery, is apt to be divided, and, when the hemorrhage is at all considerable, the vessel ought to be immediately tied. The cellular substance, between the skin and the sac, and the external investments of the latter, are to be cautiously divided, layer by layer. The fibres are to be raised with a pair of dissecting forceps, and divided with the knife having its edge turned rather horizontally. As fluid is often lodged at the bottom of the sac, this situation is deemed the safest for making the opening. The above kind of dissection should obviously be carried on only at one point, till the sac is exposed, when a little bit of it ought to be

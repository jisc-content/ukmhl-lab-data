252 HERNIA. of the testicle, which membrane forms, as. it were, the hernial sac. In the foetal state, the testicle is situated near the kidney, where it receives a covering from the peritoneum,'con- stituting its future tunica albuginea. In the latter months of pregnancy, this organ passes through the abdominal ring into the scrotum, carrying before it a portion of the peritoneum, which is to form the tunica vaginalis. In the natural progress of things, the communication between this last membranous bag and the ca- vitv of the abdomen, is abolished before the time of birth. When such a closure remains unaccomplished after the child is born, a con- genital hernia must easily take place, on the operation of any of the usual exciting causes. The rupture is only strictly congenital, or ac- tually existent at the time of birth, when the omentum, or intestine, being adherent to the testicle before birth, followed it in ns descent into the scrotum. When the testicle is late in coming into the tunica vaginalis, the hernia may precede its appearance. The rupture may exist, while the gland has but just passed the ring, and prevents the use of a truss. T he hernia may descend, while the testicle is at the ring. Both the rupture and the gland may come down together, or the testicle may pre- sent itself at the ring, after the hernia is

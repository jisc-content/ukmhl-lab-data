FRACTURES. 157 impulse made by the motions of the upper extre- mity. Its middle portion is most frequently fractured. In every case of broken clavicle, the external fragment is displaced, being drawn down by the weight of the .arm, and pulled inwards, under the internal fragment, by the great pectoral muscle. Immediately the frac- ture happens, and incapacitates the clavicle from keeping the shoulder at a certain distance from the sternum, the arm falls forwards towards the breast. One of the most striking symptoms is the inability to move the hand circularly to the forehead. The mobility of the fragments may be plainly felt and seen, as well as the projecting end of the inner one; and on moving the shoulder, a crepitus is per- ceptible. The reduction of the fracture is accomplished by raising the shoulder and push- ing it backwards and outwards, in which posi- tion it ought to be retained, till the ends of the bone have grown together. The figure of 8 bandage, which is commonl}' employed by English surgeons, serves to draw the shoulder backwards; but, has no effect in pushing the scapular portion of the clavicle outwards, and is highly objectionable, inasmuch as it tends to press it downwards, instead of raising it. Desault invented an apparatus, which operated so as to keep the shoulder elevated and drawn

WHITE SWELLINGS. 858 The distention increasing, the joint becomes painful to the touch, or on motion; inflamma- tion at length supervenes, and ulceration follows. Should the parts now be exposed by dissec- tion, the ligaments will be found in a thickened state, and sometimes destroyed; and, in diseases of the knee, the interarticular cartilages are absorbed. The articulating surfaces are more or less carious, and deprived of their cartila- ginous investment. The soft parts also under- go a change, in consequence of what happens to the joint. . The integuments manifest a puffy appearance; fluid collects beneath them; in- flammation takes place, and suppuration fol- lows. Too often, the irritation and discharge together destroy the patient, or oblige him to. submit to amputation. In that species of white swelling, which is called scrofulous, and which is supposed to have its first commencement in the heads of the bones, the sufferings of the patient are in the beginning so slight, that the swelling of the joint is often the first circum- stance, which excites attention. The skin is pale-coloured, and, on being pinched up, seems thickened, though not cedematous. Mr. Crow- ther notices, as a remarkable circumstance, that, in this indolent sort of white swelling, the bones sometimes become carious, and the ligaments diseased, even before much uneasiness

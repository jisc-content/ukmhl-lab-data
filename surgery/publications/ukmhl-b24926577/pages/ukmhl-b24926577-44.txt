5b* AMPUTATION. 6. When the amputation must be done very high up, no room remains for the tourniquet. In this example, pressure must be made upon the subclavian artery, from above the clavicle. Amputation at the Shoulder-joint. 1. The flow of blood is to be commanded by pressing the subclavian artery against the first rib, from above the cavicle. 2. A semicircular incision is to be made with the convexity downward, about four inches below the acromion, across the outside of the shoulder. This incision should reach from the back to the front edge of the deltoid muscle. The skin need not be detached from this muscle, but both are to be reflected together, as high as the joint, for the purpose of forming a flap to cover the wound. The heads of the biceps, tendons of the muscles dT the scapula, and the capsular ligament, are next to be cut, and the bone dislocated. 3. Should the articular arteries bleed pro- fusely, they may now be tied. 4. One sweep of a small amputating knifo will now complete the division, by cutting the soft parts towards the axilla below. 5. The axillary artery is to be immediately tied; any other vessel secured; the flap laid down; strips of plaster applied, &c.

There are practitioners, who are absurdly fond of dilating stabs, and of drawing setons thiough them ; but, such methods are daily giving place to milder and more rational plans. 3. Contused wounds do not admit of an union by the first intention, like simple cuts; or such union at most is only practicable at their deeper part, to which the greatest violence of the blow did not extend. However, under these circumstances, it is desirable to attempt to effect an union of as much of the wound as we can , for, though only the bottom unite, a great ad- vantage is obtained. T et, it should be remem- bered, that the surgeon is never warranted in making much pressure on the braised edges of the wound: these must inevitably undergo a great deal of inflammatory swelling, to which any degree of constriction would be highly pernicious. When the wound is excessively contused, its sides, instead of uniting, will slough. In all serious contused wounds, bleed- ing is indispensably necessary. The part may be dressed with pledgets of simple cerate, over which may be put a common poultice. A strip or two of adhesive plaster, may now and then

NECROSIS. piece of bone has been accomplished by an or- ganic process. In some instances, nature alone has succeeded in bringing about the entire detachment and expulsion of the mortified por- tion. When a superficial necrosis is an effect of the venereal disease, mercury is necessary to stop the spreading destruction of the bone; though it is obvious that no medicine can have the power of restoring vitality to what has been already destroyed. Since no particular benefit can be derived from topical applications, in cases where a superficial scale of bone is exfo- liating, our chief care should be not to use such as will do harm. Soft pieces of lint, co- vered with a pledget of simple ointment, or with an emollient poultice, where much irrita- tion prevails, are the most proper dressings. Occasionally, the surgeon may try whether the dead part of the bone be loose, with his probe, or forceps; for, immediately it is sufficiently detached, it should always be extracted from the ulcer. When it is loose, but cannot be taken out, owing to the way in which it is covered with the flesh, an incision must be made, to facilitate its extraction. Rasping the exfoliating layer of bone is useless; inasmuch as it is as easy for nature to establish a line of separation under a thick as under a thin lamella of bone. Making perforations is hurtful, since

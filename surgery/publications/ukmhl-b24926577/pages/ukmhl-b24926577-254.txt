246 HERNIA. which the viscera glide into the sheath of the crural vessels. The sac, however, has a thin, tendinous covering, named by Mr. A. Cooper, the fascia propria. The upper end of what is named the falciform process of the femoral fascia passes over the upper and outer part of the neck of the tumor, is then folded under C.U3L- crural arch, and is continued to its thin ^ posterior border. The strangulation is pro- duced, as Gimbernat first discovered, by the pressure of the thin back margin of Poupart's ligament, or of the crural arch. The above falciform process has also an inferior share in contributing to the strangulation, and the stricture is certainly diminished, by relaxing the femoral fascia, and this production of it. The epigastric artery passes obliquely upwards and inwards, on the outside of'the hernial sac, about half an inch from its neck. When the obturator artery arises from the epigastric, it . may run to the obturator foramen*either over the inner, or outer margin of the sac. The iliac vein lies on its outside. The round liga- ment of the uterus, or, in men, the spermatic cord, passes over the upper part of the swelling, not more than half an inch from the mouth of the sac. The space through which the viscera descend being very small, the femoral hernia is seldom large. It mostly contains intestine,

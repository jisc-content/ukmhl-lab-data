aneurism. 57 the artery, according as the operator prefers tying the vessel in one, or two places. Care must be taken not to include the vein. Aneurism of the axillary Artery. 1. The subclavian, as well as the external iliac artery, may be tied, without the upper extremity being deprived of a proper supply of blood, as a case in St. Bartholomewâ€™s Hospital has recently established. 2. Axillary aneurisms may be cured by tying the subclavian artery; and the requisite inci- sions may be made either above, or below, the clavicle. 3. Below this bone, an incision might be made obliquely downward, some of the fibres of the pectoral muscle be divided, and a liga- ture put under the artery with an eye-probe. Did the aneurism not extend too far inward, the vessel might be got at by an incision just over the place, where the pectoral and deltoid muscles meet, and where there would be no need of cutting any muscular fibres at all. 4. The subclavian artery may also be tied by dividing the integuments just over the sternal end of the clavicle, pushing the sterno* cleido-mastoideus to oue side, and passing a ligature under the pulsating vessel with an aneurism-needle. The last step is the chief dif-

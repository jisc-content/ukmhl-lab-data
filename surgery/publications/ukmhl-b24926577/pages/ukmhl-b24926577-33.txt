TREATMENT. 1. Chronic abscesses having little disposi- tion to burst, before their size is enormous, a chief indication is always to open them as soon as they are known to exist. 2. Large lumbar abscesses, and all analogous chronic collections of matter, when very con- siderable, must not have a more ample opening made in them, than is necessary for the escape of the contents.

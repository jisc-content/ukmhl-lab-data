DISLOCATIONS. 137' iibula can only happen, when its ligaments are morbidly relaxed. In these cases, the applica- tion of a piece of the emplastrum saponis, and ,i roller, is all that can be well done. 9. In a dislocation of the foot, the astragalus must be partly or entirely propelled from the quadrangular cavity, in which it is, as it were, locked-; and it is either pushed against one of the malleoli, or before or behind these emi- nences. An accident, of this sort, cannot happen without the rupture of several liga- ments. The most frequent dislocation is that inwards, owing to the malleolus interims being {•shorter than the malleolus externus. It can ibe caused by a violent abduction of the foot, aand it is readily known by the sole being ‘turned outwards, the pain, the impossibility of motion, and by the tumor, which the astra- cgalus forms below the internal malleolus. The luxation outwards is produced by a violent ad- duction of the foot. The sole is turned in- wards, the instep outwards, and the astragalus projects below the external malleolus. The dislocation backwards is caused by a sviolent flexion of the foot; that forwards, by too great extension. In the last case, the as- tragalus is forced in front of the bones of the leg, the anterior ligaments of the joint arerup- uured, the heel shortened, the foot lengthened,

In order that the plan may succeed, it is essential that the lips of the wound directly touch each other, and that they be separated by no interspace, nor extraneous substances. Hence, when any dirt, bits of glass, See. lie in the wound, they must be care- fully washed 'away, or picked out. Success will also be promoted by the surfaces being still so recently cut as to bleed a little, and by- their not being contused, nor inflamed. We will not enter into the question, whether a part totally detached from the body has ever united to it again, after having been quickly replaced. The principal arguments in favour of this controverted point, .are deduced, first, from Garengeotâ€™s case, where a soldier's nose was bit off, yet, on being replaced, became united again.

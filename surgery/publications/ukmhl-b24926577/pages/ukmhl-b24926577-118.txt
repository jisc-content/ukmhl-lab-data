110 CATARACT. a little above its transverse diameter, and just before its connexion with the sclerotica. It is to be pushed on slowly and steadily, without any stoppage, in a straight direction, with its blade parallel to the iris, so as to pierce the cornea, towards the inner angle of the eye, on the side, opposite to that, which it first entered. Supposing Wareâ€™s knife to be used, the blade is to be pushed onward, till about one third of it has emerged from the cornea. When the knife has reached thus far, its edge is below the pupil, so that the margin of the iris is no longer in danger of being wounded, and the instrument itself keeps the eye steady. The fingers are now not to make any more pressure upon the eyeball; but, are only to be used in separating the eyelids. The inci- sion of the cornea? is then to be completed by pressing the knife slowly downward, till it has cut its way out, a little before the semicir- cular junction of this membrane with the> sclerotica. W'hen the iris comes too forward, in the performance of this incision, it will recede if the operator rub the cornea down- ward with his finger. Care must be taken not to incline the ed^e of the knife too much forward, lest tire opening in the cornea be too small for the easy extraction of the cataract. Nor must tire edge be directed too much back-

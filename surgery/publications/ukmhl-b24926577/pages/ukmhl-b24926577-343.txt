As soon ns the ulcer becomes stationary, its edges swell, rather from oedema, than inflammation; and such cliangfc is manifestly owing to a relaxed state of the solids, and to the tardiness, with which the blood returns towards the heart. The tumefaction at the circumference of the sore lasts a certain time ; the edges gradually acquire a thickened callous state, and the dis- ease is perpetuated by neglect. The majority of persons thus afflicted, being engaged in laborious pursuits, which they are reluctant to abandon, frequently defer going into an hos- pital, till the disease lias existed many months, or even years.

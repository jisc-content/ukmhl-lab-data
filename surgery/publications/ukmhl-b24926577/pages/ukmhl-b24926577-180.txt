However, if the splints are well made, and long* enough, the foot will be rendered very steady' by them. In France, it is objected to the bent position, that it does not relax all the muscles ; that the posture is very apt to be altered by movements of the patient when asleep; that it creates painful pressure on the great trochanter and malleolus externus, over which processes, ul- ceration and sloughing are often induced. No one can deny, however, that the bent position relaxes the muscles of the calf, which are the most powerful in deranging and disturbing the fracture. The straight position is, perhaps, to be preferred, when there are sores or sloughs on the trochanter and lower part of the fibula. The splints ought to reach above the knee, and a little beyond the sole of the foot. Fractures of the tibia, or fibula, alone, are detected by tracing the most superficial parts of the bone with the fingers, and moving the foot about, which will often occasion a crepitus. 9. Fractures of the patella differ from most others, in being generally caused by a violent action of the extensor muscles of the leg, which rend the bone asunder. I he upper frag-

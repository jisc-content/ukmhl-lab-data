135 DISLOCATIONS. being ruptured; nor upwards, without the li- j igament of the patella being broken. rIhe dis- | locations inwards and outwards may happen I’without other mischief. The luxation out- j wards is the most frequent. The inner edge ot lithe bone projects more than the outer, and the articular surface of the external condyle is broader, and less prominent, than that of the inner one. Every thing seems to facilitate the i dislocation outwards. The accident happens, when a hard body strikes against the inside of j! the patella, when the knee is somewhat bent. The luxation, however, is never complete. In every instance of luxated kneepan, the imuscles, attached to the bone, must be relaxed, !by extending the leg upon the thigh, and 1bending the thigh a little upon the pelvis. The ibone is then to be pushed inwards or outwards, according as it is displaced. The patient may be bled after the reduction, in order to avert inflammation of the joint. Cold washes may jibe applied to the part, and, if necessary, leeches. Rest is essentially proper. 7. A complete luxation of the knee, sup- ■ poses an entire laceration of all the numerous ligaments and tendons, which strengthen this articulation. To cause this mischief, such a force must operate, as has never been observed, if we reject from consideration, the tearing h. 4

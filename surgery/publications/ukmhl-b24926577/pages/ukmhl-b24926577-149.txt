141 ECTROPIUM. tmostly the consequence of a cicatrix, after the jinn all-pox, deep burns, the excision of some jjttumor, &c. TREATMENT. When the loss of substance, in the second iskind of ectropium, exceeds a certain quantity, a perfect cure is impossible. When so much is s-dost, that the edge of the eyelid is adherent to ; the margin of the orbit, the case admits of no melioration. The first species of ectropium, in a recent state, maybe cured by destroying The fungous thickening of the inside of the (.eyelid with the argentum nitratum, some oil Ibeing put on the eschar as soon as it is formed, ;tto keep the caustic from hurting the eye, which limay also be washed with milk. The application of the caustic is to be repeated as often as ne- ccessary, after which, simple collyria will com- plete the cure. When the disease is inveterate, the best plan is to cut away all the thickened ] part of the inside of the eyelid, with a pair of i convex-edged scissors, or a scalpel and forceps. A compress and bandage are then to be put over the outside of the eyelid. Ihe second species of ectropium is also cu- rable or improvable by a similar operation, in which a piepe of the inside of the eyelid is to be cut away.

The ligatures should be drawn with firmness, to ensure the division of the inner coats of the artery, the portion of which betwixt the liga- tures is to be now cut through. 8. One end of each ligature is to be cut off, and then the edges of the incision are to be brought into contact with adhesive plaster. 9. If the ligatures are on the artery, the tumor immediately ceases to pulsate, and its contents are afterwards gradually diminished by the action of the absorbents, till no appear- ance of swelling remains, and the patient regains the perfect use of the neighbouring joint, and, indeed, of the whole limb. * 10. It is rendered probable, from Dr. Jones's experiments, that if one ligature were applied with due tightness to the artery, and were imme- diately cut and removed, the artery would afterwards inflame and become impervious^ so that the cure of the aneurism might be effected equally well without any ligature remaining to â€¢ act, in the wound, as an extraneous substance, and source of irritation, ulceration, and ab- scesses.

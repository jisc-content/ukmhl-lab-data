ABSCESSES, 17 about the os'sacrum, or lower lumbar vertebrae. The first often admit of cure ; the latter seldom. The first require the sinuses to be opened, so as to hinder all lodgment of matter, and the cavities to be opened fairly into the intestine. The in- ternal parts of the hollows may be slightly sca- rified, but not dressed with escharotics. In- curably indurated flaps, &c. may be cut off. The dressings are to be soft, easy, and light. When loose fungous flesh appears on the sore, the lunar caustic will repress it. When the bad state of the case is owing to the fistula having been crammed with irritating dressings, leaving such practice off will produce an opposite change. The disorder of the constitution, depending upon ill management of the local disease, will also vanish when a mote judicious plan is followed. Mammary, or Milk Abscess, and other Abscesses of the Breast. SYMPTOMS. The mammary abscess is an inflammation of the breast, ending in suppuration. The case is attended with considerable pain and fever, and the abscess is generally surrounded with a sur- prising degree of induration. It mostly arises soon after parturition, or about the time when an infant is weaned. c

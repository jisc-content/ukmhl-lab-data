BLADDER, PUNCTURE OF. 66 double one, the inner part of which admits of being taken out to be cleaned. 7. The manner in which the bladder soon becomes adherent to the parts above the pubes, shows the inutility of having a very long can- nula, the end of which may press upon the bladder, and do mischief. 8. As soon as the perviousness of the ure- thra is fully re-established, the cannula need no longer be worn. 9â€¢ Some have objected to this operation, that the situation of the opening does not allow the whole of the urine to escape. But, it is easy to put the patient in a position, in which the opening will be quite depending. 10. The chief circumstances in favour of the method are : it is easy and not painful; it is almost impossible to miss the bladder (sup- posing it not be morbidly contracted); no part of consequence is liable to be wounded; the trocar pierces the bladder, where, in these cases, it is least disposed to inflammation ; the cannula can be easily fixed, and the patient con- veniently wear it, either as he walks, stands, or lies down; the wound heals more readily, than in a lower place; lastly, this method is the only admissible one, when a swelling of the prostate, or an inflammation of the neck of the bladder, prevails.

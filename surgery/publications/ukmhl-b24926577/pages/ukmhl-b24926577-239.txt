HERNIA. m q 4 parts by the hand are termed the taxi*, which is certainly the first thing to be tried. Tho patient should lie down upon his back, and, in case of inguinal, or femoral hernia, the pelvis ought to be more elevated than the shoulders, the thorax somewhat raised, the thigh bent, and turned inwards. Gentle pressure is now to be made on the tumor, and its force is to be gradually increased; but all rude violence is to be reprobated, as incapable of doing good; apt to burst the protruded intestine, and produce other sorts of injury; and manifestly tending to exasperate the inflammation of the parts. One hand is usually employed for compressing the tumor, while the other is put near the mouth of the sac, and serves to keep such por- tions of the viscera as may be reduced, from escaping again. In an inguinal hernia, the parts descend downwards and inwards; in a femoral rupture, they pass from the abdomen first downwards, and then forwrardsâ€”circum- stances, whicli a surgeon must understand, ere he can know how to direct the pressure in a judicious manner. Supposing the first trials of the taxis to have failed, the next thing very commonly adopted is bleeding. This operation is practised on the principle of inducing swoon- ing and a general relaxation, a state, which is deemed highly propitious to the reduction of

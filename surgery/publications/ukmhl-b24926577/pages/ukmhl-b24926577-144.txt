DISLOCATIONS. 136 away of the limbs by cannon-balls. Even in- complete luxations inwards or outwards, arc very rare, so much are these accidents opposed by the extent of the articular surfaces, and the strength of the ligaments and tendons. Dislo- cations forwards or backwards, are also ren- dered almost impossible, by the manner, in which the patella and crucial ligament resist their occurrence. However, when the leg is fixed, and the body is forced onwards, the tibia may be partly forced away from the lower end of the femur, to one side or another. Such an event implies great violence, and a rupture of many ligaments. The deformity makes the nature of the case very manifest. The reduction is easily accomplished by push- ing the heads of the bones in opposite direc- tions, while the articular surfaces are a little separated by a moderate extension of the limb. After the reduction, the indication is to pre- vent inflammation of the joint by cold washes, leeches, venesection, opening medicines, abso- lute rest, See. 8. The fibula is not always fractured by a vio- lent abduction of the foot. Sometimes, though indeed seldom, on the latter part being twisted outwards) the strong ligaments, uniting the lower end of the fibula to the tibia, are rup- tured.

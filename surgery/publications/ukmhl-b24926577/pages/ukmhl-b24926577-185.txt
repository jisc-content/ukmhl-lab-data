177 FRACTURES. edges carefully together with strips of sticking- plaster. Though entire success will not always follow this attempt, it seldom happens, that none of the wound will unite, though a part may suppurate. In proportion as the wound may be lessened, or united, by this means, so may the danger of a compound fracture be said to be diminished. Indeed, after the wound is healed, the case, in regard to danger, treatment, &c. is onlv to be considered as a simple fracture. Sometimes, when the end of the bone projects beyond the skin, a reduction cannot easily be effected, without dilating the wound. In other instances, when the pro- jecting piece of bone is long, and the muscles act in a violent and spasmodic manner, it is recommended to saw off such portion of bone, since it could only be reduced by the exertion of such force, as might be attended with the most hurtful injury to the limb. In the inflammatory stage of compound fractures, a strict antiphlogistic treatment is proper, even bleeding being indicated when the patient is young, strong, and resident out of a large city. When suppuration has come on, evacuations must be left off, and bark, wine, cordials, fresh air, and a nourishing diet are indicated. N

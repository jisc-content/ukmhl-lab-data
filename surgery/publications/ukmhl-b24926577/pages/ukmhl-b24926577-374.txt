Very often the operation of position may be mate- rially assisted with a common roller and com- V presses, skilfully applied, or with the uniting bandage, which is made by placing the middle of a double-headed roller on the limb or body, directly opposite the injury, bringing the heads to each other, over the wound, and then cutting a slit in one part of the ban- dage for the passage of the other. This plan is repeated till the necessary extent of the body, or member, is covered with the circles, a compress being first laid over each side of the wound. The uniting bandage is particularly suited to longitudinal wounds, cases, in which it may render sticking-plaster almost unneces- sary. Strips of adhesive plaster, aided by po- sition and the pressure of compresses and a roller, are the most extensively used for main- taining the edges of wounds in contact. They are employed both for uniting accidental cuts and the wounds occasioned by amputa-* tions, and the majority of surgical operations. As they only act by means of their adhesion to the cuticle, their length and breadth ought in some measure to be proportioned to the difii- culty of keeping the sides of the wound ap-

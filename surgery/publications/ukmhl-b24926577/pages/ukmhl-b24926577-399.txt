Contusions of the sides of the abdomen are sometimes followed by such an incapacity of resistance in them, that they yield to the pressure of the contained parts, and constitute a particular kind of hernial tumor. Hence, after a wound of the abdomen has been healed by means of position, adhesive plaster, and a bandage, writers generally state, that the patient should be enjoined to wear a belt for supporting the cicatrix. Except when a wound of the belly is attended with protru- sion of a piece of intestine, or omentum, the fact of its having penetrated the cavity of the abdomen is generally attended with some obscurity. Authors do, indeed, lay down cir- cumstances of discrimination.

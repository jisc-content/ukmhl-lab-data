The disease continuing to increase, the eyeball loses its natural figure, and assumes an irregular knobby appearance. The sclerotica also * loses its white colour, and becomes of a dark blue, or livid hue. Sometimes, matter now collects between the tumor and the cornea. The latter membrane in time ulcerates, and the fungus shoots out. In a few instances, it makes its way through the sclerotica, and is then covered by the conjunctiva.

On dissection, a diseased mass is found extending forwards from the entrance of the optic nerve, the vitreous, crystalline, and aqueous humors being absorbed. The retina is annihilated, and the choroid coat pro- pelled forwards, or quite destroyed. The tumor seems to consist of a sort of medullary matter,

52 ANEURISM. the method often accelerates gangrene. All bandages are hurtful, w hich compress the aneu- rism, and circularly constrict at the same time the affected part; which make pressure only on a point below the breach in the artery; which do not press the artery effectually against the bone; or which are applied to spontaneous aneurisms arising from a diseased state of the coats of the artery. In cases, completely oppo- site to those just pointed out, bandages may produce a complete and radical cure. 8. The obliteration of the artery, for some way, above and below the breach in it, is the primary indication, whether the cure be attempt- ed by compression, or by the ligature. Other means contribute to the effect only inasmuch as they tend to moderate the impetuosity of the blood towards the place, where the artery is compressed, or tied.

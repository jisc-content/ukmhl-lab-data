STRICTURES. 5'24 laterally and behind it is every where surrounded by the composition of the bougies, while in front it forms a surface fitted tor acting on the stricture. The exact distance of the obstruc- tion, from the orifice in the glans, is to be first measured with a common bougie, on which an impression is to be made with the nail, just where the instrument begins to be uncovered by the glans. A mark is now to be made on the armed bougie, exactly at the same distance from its point, as the impression is from the point of the common bougie. When the mark arrives at the orifice in the gians, the surgeon knows that the surface of the caustic is then in contact with the stricture. Care must always be taken to have the common bougie fully as large as the armed one. The latter is to be oiled, passed quickly down to the stricture, and kept applied about a minute every otlicr day. Mr. #Whately arms his bougies by inserting a small bit * of kali purum, about the size of a pins head, in a little hole, made with a blanket pin, on the end of the bougie. The caustic is to be well pressed, and fixed in this situation, and then coverei with a little hogâ€™s lard, This gentleman seems to regard strictures as occupying more extent of the drethra, than Mr. Home has represented Therefore, as soon as the bougie, armed w ith the kali purum, has reached the anterior part o

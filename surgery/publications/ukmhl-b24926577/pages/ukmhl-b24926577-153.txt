ENCANTHIS. 145 encanthis is often of considerable size, its roots extending along the inside of the eyelids. The disease hinders the eye from being perfectly closed; keeps up chronic ophthalmy; and impedes the flow of the tears, through the puncta iachrymalia, into the nose. There is, moreover, an encanthis, which puts on a can- cerous malignity, denoted by the dark-red, or leaden colour, the great hardness, the darting pains, the bleeding disposition, the ulcerations, fungi, and sanious discharge, of the disease. TREATMENT. The cure of the encanthis is effected by cut- ting the excrescence away, together with the appendages reaching along the inside of the eyelids. This is best done with a small scalpel and a pair of forceps. Care must be taken not to be too bold with the knife in dividing the base of the excrescence, for fear of injuring the lachrymal sac and puncta Iachrymalia, so as to cause an irremediable fluN of tears over the cheek. After the operation, the eye is to be well washed with cold water, and covered with a compress of fine linen. After five or six days, touching the sore with the argentum nitratum, and bathing the eye with a vitriolic collyrium containing the mucilage of quince- seeds, will complete the cure. h

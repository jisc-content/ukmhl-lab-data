171 FRACTURES. tlie accident only befals one, which is most frequently the fibula, which is slender, and liable to be fractured by a violent abduction of the foot, as well as by blows. In some vin- stances, fractures of the leg happen higher up near the knee, where the thickness of the tibia is considerable, and where no particular dis- placement occurring, the injury may pos- sibly be mistaken. But, in general, the weight of the foot drags aud deranges the lower frag- ments, so as to deform the limb, while the nature of the case is rendered still more manifest by the mobility, crepitus, and pain. In Eng- land, the majority of surgeons reduce and treat fractures of the leg in a bent position, the patient being laid on his side. The counter- extension is made on the upper pieces of the broken bones, and the extension a little above the ankle, while the leg is lying on its outside, bent on the thigh, and the latter bent on the pelvis, to about an acute angle. A splint, fur- nished with a soft pad, an eighteen-tailed bandage, and proper straps, is then to be laid under the limb. Some emplastrum sapo iis is to be applied over the injury, and the tails of the bandage put down in a regular manner. The business is finished by putting on the upper pad and splint, to the pegs of which the Straps, proceeding from the lower one, are to

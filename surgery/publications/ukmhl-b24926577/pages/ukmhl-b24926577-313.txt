305 PILES. 3. Piles are denominated blind, when they do not habitually bleed ; open, in the opposite circumstance. Hemorrhage is one of the chief grievances liable to attend this disease. The loss of blood often creates a general debility of the whole system, and actually endangers life itself. In this event, prudence dictates, that no more time should be devoted to palliative methods ; but, that the operation of extirpating the tumors should be executed without the least delay. 4. Writers caution us not to remove piles, which are of very long standing, which make habitual discharges of blood, or, which have come on, after the subsidence of another more serious malady. The fear of bringing on a more dangerous affection is the reason of this doctrine, to which, however, few surgeons in this country attach much credit. 5. The general causes of piles are referred to circumstances, which operate by retarding and obstructing the return of blood through the hemorrhoidal veins.

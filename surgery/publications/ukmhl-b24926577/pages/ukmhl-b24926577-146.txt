1 138 DISLOCATION'S. and permanently extended. In the luxation back- wards, the projection of the heel is increased, the foot is shortened and bent, the astragalus is situated behind the tibia, and the posterior ligaments are ruptured. Sometimes, in com- pound cases, the astragalus is so detached from the os calcis, that surgeons take it away; and, it a cure is effected, an anchylosis cannot be avoided. A luxation of the foot inwards, is often complicated with a fracture of the lower part of the fibula. Dislocations of the foot are not difficult of reduction, when care is taken to relax the strong muscles of the calf by position. The case is then generally put up, and treated just like a fracture of the leg. 10. Of all the tarsal bones, the astragalus alone is subject to be dislocated, which it may be from the cavity in the posterior surface of the os scaphoides. This is liable to happen, when the fore-part of the foot being fixed, the pa- tient falls backwards. The head of the astra- galus is then forced upwards from the sca- phoides, and projects upon the instep. An en- deavour should be made to force the bone back again into its place by pressure. Some em- plastrum saponis and a roller are then to be ap- plied, and quietude enjoined. The first pha- lanx of the great toe is perhaps liable to be

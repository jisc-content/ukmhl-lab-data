If much difficulty should occur, an opening must be made in the sac itself. The stricture having been cut, an endeavour is to be made to return such of the viscera as may ad- mit of reduction. The edges of the incision are then to be brought into contact with ad- hesive plaster. When the hernia has not passed the ring, the operation consists in making an incision through the tendon of the external oblique muscle, opening the sac, and dividing the edge of the transverse and internal oblique muscles either upwards, or upwards and out- wards. In all operations for herniae, when the omentum is much thickened and enlarged, the diseased portion is to be cut off, and the rest reduced.

The ligature, indeed, may be regarded as producing a worse strangulation than what has just been removed. When the diseased

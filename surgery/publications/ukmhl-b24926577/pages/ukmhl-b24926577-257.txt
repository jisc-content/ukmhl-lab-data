Adults are more liable to that species of the complaint, in which the hernia happens somewhere near this opening. The protruded parts tend downwards, so that the opening into the'abdomen is at the upper part of the swell- â€¢ ing. When umbilical hernias are neglected, they arc apt to attain such a size as to hang down lower than the pubes, incapacitating the patient from active exertion, and forming a constant source of intestinal complaints.

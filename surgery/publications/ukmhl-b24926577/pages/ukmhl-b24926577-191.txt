183 FUNGUS ILT.MATOUES. N 4 incessant and of a darling kind. For a consi- derable time, the tumor is smooth and even; hut, afterwards, it projects irregularly at one, or more points. Here the skin feels thinner than elsewhere, yielding to pressure; but, instantly rising up again when such pressure is removed. One part of the tumor often feels, as if it contained fluid ; while another is exceed- ingly hard. In time, one or more openings in the skin are produced, and through these the fungous mass is protruded, and increases in size with astonishing rapidity, though, before the skin ulcerates, the growth of the tumor is in general slow. The fungus is usually of a round form, and lias an unequal surface, often covered with clots of blood. It is of a dark- red colour, is easily torn, and bleeds on being touched. Its neck is generally narrow, and its body spreads out over the edge of the ulcerated skin. When the fungus is very large, parts slough away. Sometimes, the absorbent glands become contaminated while the swelling is small; sometimes, not before ulceration hap- pens. Upon dissectiop, the tumor is found to consist of a medullary substance much resem- bling brain, intersected by thin membranes, and often containing cavities filled with a thin bloody matter. In the adipose membrane, numerous pouches, distended by the fungus.

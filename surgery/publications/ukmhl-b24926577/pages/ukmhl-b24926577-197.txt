GANGLION. 189 track of the extensor tendons of the hand and fingers; (though sometimes on the foot, nape of the neck, See.) Ganglions are at first scarcely perceptible; they enlarge gradually; and attain the size of a filbert, walnut, or small egg. In proportion as they increase in magnitude, the motions of the part, into which the tendon is inserted, become inter- rupted. The tumor is. neither attended with heat, pain, nor redness. Upon holding a light behind the swelling, it will be found to be transparent. Although very tense, an ex- amination with the fingers may ascertain the presence of a fluid. The tumor is more or less moveable under the skin, especially when pushed in the direction of the tendon, in the sheath of which it happens to be formed. On dissecting a ganglion, it appears to consist qf a thin cyst, filled with a transparent fluid, the viscidity of which sometimes equals that of white of egg. Celsus, with much reason, classed ganglions with encysted tumors; in- deed, they bear a great resemblance to the meliceris; the chief difference being their lying within the sheath of a tendon, or very near it; for, in reality, their situation is often on the outside of it.

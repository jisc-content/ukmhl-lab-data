After exposing the bone, many surgeons, very unnecessarily and wrongly, trouble them- selves with scraping away the pericranium, as if it could make any material opposition to the action of the saw. Were such scraping con- fined accurately to the circle of bone about to be removed, certainly the proceeding might onlv be objectionable on the ground of inutility and delay. But, when, as generally happens, in the hurry of the operation, the surgeon scrapes the pericranium off a part of the bone, which he does not intend to remove, lie is doing a thing which is exceedingly likely to lead to exfoliations.' This unpleasant consequence, in- deed, must follow the practice, whenever the dura mater is also detached from the inner table by extravasated blood, since the supply of the cranium with blood is entirely furnished the vessels of these two membranes. 6. When no fracture can be felt, and symp- toms demanding the operation exist, the scalp should be divided wherever any wound, con- tusion, or vestige of external violence, happens to be situated, since extravasations mostly oc- cur under the part where the blow hai been

STRICTURE*. 319 the method of treatment, it becomes the duty of the surgeon to puncture the bladder, as the only means of averting inflammation and gangrene of this organ, an extravasation ot urine among the bowels, or in the cellular membrane, peritonitis, and death. STRICTURES. SYMPTOMS, &C. Some strictures of the urethra are entirely spasmodic, and are so unconnected with any alteration of structure in the membrane of that canal, that, if an ocular examination could be made, when the spasm had subsided, there would be no vestige of disease whatsoever. A permanent stricture is a kind of ridge, which arises from the side of the canal. Some have imagined, that strictures are usually of con- siderable extent; but Mr. Home has fre- quently examined the urethra, and ascertained, that, in general, a stricture consists only of .the thickness of a single fold of the membrane of the canal, with an intervening portion of cellular membrane. The ridge ordinarily exists on every side of the urethra, and of course is circular ; but there are cases where the projection is merely a segment Â©f a circle.

24$ HERVIA the operation performed after twelve hours, in case tobacco-clysters should not succeed. In the operation, the incision of the integuments is to begin an inch above the crural ring, and be carried obliquely downwards and outwards, as advised by Mr. Lawrence. The outer in- vestment of the hernial sac is to be cut through in the same way as was described in treating of the inguinal hernia. Great caution is necessary in making an opening into the sac, as there is seldom much fluid in it, or any omentum with the intestine. In cutting the stricture, the direction of the incision is highly important. If the knife be directed upwards and outwards, the epigastric artery is endan- gered. In cutting straight upwards, the sper- matic cord is in peril in male patients. An in- cision of the most interior part of the stricture is only attended with risk, when the obturator artery arises from the epigastric, and runs round the inner margin of the sac. Mr. Law- rence, with great reason, thinks that the best and safest method is to divide the thin poste- ' rior border of the crural arch, at the part first advised by Gimbcrnat, namely, as near as pos- sible to its insertion into the os pubis. This is the very part, which in fact produces the stric- ture. The tip of the nail, or a director, is to be put under the part of the tendon to be cut,

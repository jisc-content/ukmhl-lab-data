ANEURISM. 54 5. The operation for the popliteal aneurism consists in cutting down to the artery above the tumor, and in tying the vessel with a ligature, so as to hinder the blood from passing into the aneurismal sac, and oblige it to go into the lower part of the limb through the lateral anastomosing vessels. 6'. The artery being often diseased for some way above the tumor, the chance of success is increased by applying the ligature at a certain distance from the swelling. In England, it has been common to tie the artery, a little before it passes through the tendon of the triceps; but Scarpa, with much reason, prefers doing this somewhat higher up, so as not to have the sartorius in the way. 7. An incision about three inches long, is to be made over the course of the artery; the fascia of the thigh, and the sheath of the artery itself, arc to be slit open; and a double ligature put under the vessel, with an aneurism-needle. The artery should be disturbed, and separated from its attachments, as little as possible. The ligature should be firm and round, and not too thick, in order that it may cut through the muscular and internal coats of the artery, so as to give rise to the effusion of coagulating lymph, and the adhesive inflammation. The aneurism- needle is to be cut off, and one part of the ligature is to be applied above, the other below,

A few large, old, irreducible ruptures have been made to return into the abdomen by long confine- ment to bed, and low diet, with occasional bleeding and purging. In this way, Arnaud, Le Dran, and Hey, have been successful. It is obvious, that the plan can only succeed, when the impediment to reduction proceeds from an enlargement "of the protruded parts, and not from adhesions. The absorption of the morbid mass might also certainly be pro- moted by combining, with the above means, the pressure of a suspensory bandage. This, indeed, should always be worn, to prevent the swelling from increasing in size. Patients, having irreducible herniae, are to be advised to avoid all violent exertions, eat no indigestible flatulent food, and keep their bowels regularly open.

WHITLOW. SYMPTOMS. A whitlow usually implies an abscess, situated near the end of one of the fingers, or thumbs, very often close to the nail, or even under it. Whitlows, when the matter does not lie more deeply than the skin, are attended with consider- able pain and throbbing in the part affected, and, frequently, with a degree of restlessness and fever. But, if the abscess is situated within the sheath of the flexor tendon, the symptoms may be excessively severe. The matter will be long in making its way to the surface, and, increasing in quantity, may spread to a vast distance up the hand and arm. The disease often destroys the nail, and not unfrequently renders the linger-bones carious.

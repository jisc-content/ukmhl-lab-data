ANEURISM. So ficial cure, there are often two stages; in the first the entrance of the blood into the aneu- rismal sac is interrupted; in the second, the parietes of the artery are made to approach each other, and become firmly agglutinated together. Hence, in both methods of cure, the aneurism first loses its pulsation, and then diminishes and disappears. 4. The adhesive inflammation, and conse- quent obliteration of the tube of a large artery, have also been seen to follow a violent contusion of such vessel, especially if immedi- ately, or a little after the accident, the course of the blood, within the contused artery, is arti- ficially interrupted. 5. When aneurisms fall into a state of gan- grene, the artery occasionally becomes imper- vious for some distance above and below its com- municaton with the sac. This is accounted for by all the parts around the root of the aneurism, being affected with violent inflammation, which agglutinates and closes the artery. Or a dense, compact coagulum is formed within the vessel, and completely stops the course of the blood. Hence, when gangrene attacks deeply the root of an aneurism, the bursting of the sac never gives rise to a fatal hemorrhage. On the con- trary, if the patient has strength enough, he recovers both of the aneurism and mortifiea- 4

Very soon after the operation, inflammation produces an adhesion of the punctured part of the bladder to the abdominal muscles, so as to ll hinder that organ from slipping away from the i cannula. The adhesive inflammation, also, ‘(doses the surrounding interstices of the cel- llular membrane, and prevents extravasation. Ex- perience has proved, likewise, that the cannula imay be taken out, and put in again, without '.the least difficulty. {Noel, in Desault's Journal de Chirurgie, tom. ii. Turner, London Med. Journ. vol. ii.) The adhesions form very quickly. flThe cannula has been withdrawn as soon as the :third day; and replaced without trouble. 5.

227 HERNIA. Q 2 wearing a proper truss. Whenever the parts are allowed to remain protruded, a risk is in- duced of an additional quantity of the viscera falling down into the sac, so as to bring on a strangulated state of the hernia. The neg- lected tumor will also gradually attain a trou- blesome and grievous magnitude. In young subjects, the incessant use of a truss may ac- complish a permanent cure, the chance of which happy event, however, is always de- stroyed by suffering the parts occasionally to descend and dilate the opening, through which they pass. 2. In irreducible ruptures, the usual impedi- ments to reduction are either a morbid thick- ening and enlargement, of the omentum, or mesentery, in the hernia ; adhesion of the vis- cera to each other, or to the hernial sac; or membranous bands crossing the cavity of this latter part. An irreducible hernia must be left in a great measure to itself, notwithstanding its bulk and gradual increase are sources of in- convenience, while the possibility of strangu- lation is a ground for the apprehension of danger. Opening the tumor, separating ad- hesion, removing the thickened omentum, and taking other steps, for the reduction of the hernia, are proceedings, attended with so much risk of inducing a dangerous and fatal !â€¢/

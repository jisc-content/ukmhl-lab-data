When they are both fractured, or when the ulna alone is broken, the accident is generally the effect of some blow, or violence applied directly to the fore-arm, But, when the radius is fractured by itself, the injury is almost always produced by falls on the hand. The diagnosis of these cases is rendered plain, by the previous blow on the fore-arm, or the fall on the hand; by the pain; by the deformity, which is the more apparent as the bones are on one side merely covered with skin; by the jnobiiity of the fragments; the crepitus ; and the impediment to the pronation and supina- tion of the hand. When only one bone is broken, the displacement is, indeed, not con- siderable, the one which is entire, serving like a splint, to steady the other. However, in all cases the ends of the fracture have a tendency to incline towards the centre of the fore-arm, and thereby diminish the interosseous space. One of the chief objects in the treatment of fractures of the fore-arm is to preserve the natural width of the interosseous space. With this view, the muscles are to be pressed

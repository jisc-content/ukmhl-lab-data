46 â–º ANEURISM. ' SYMPTOMS. Mistaken writers have enumerated the marks by which it was conceived possible to distin- guish a true aneurism formed by dilatation, from a false aneurism arising from effusion. They say, that the true aneurism may be dis- tinguished from the false, by being, at the commencement, small, circumscribed, indolent; without any change in the colour of the skin covering it; easily compressed, hut, on re- moving the compression, immediately reappear- ing, as before. The same authors state, that it augments slowly, and that in proportion as it in- creases, the pulsation in it becomes weaker and more obscure, until it disappears entirely. On the other hand, in the false aneurism, these appearances are said to be reversed ; while the case is accompanied with a hissing noise, and, away from the centre, with a small trem- bling or oscillation, not felt in the true aneu- rism. That the above symptoms are not character- istic of a true aneurism, is proved by what is seen in aneurisms from puncture. In these, if the wound has been very small, the same symptoms occur, which have been set down as peculiar to true aneurisms. Scarpa has explained, that whenever the laceration or ulceration of the internal coat of the artery, from an internal

CHILBLAINS. lit usually disappears of itself. In a more severe degree, the swelling is larger, redder, and some- times of a dark blue colour; while the heat, itching, and pain are so violent, that the patient cannot use the part. In the third degree, small vesicles arise, burst, and produce an excoria- tion, which quickly changes into an ill-condi- tioned ulcer. The sore discharges a thin acrid fluid, is in general very obstinate, and some- times penetrates so deeply as to render the subjacent bone carious. In the worst degree, the inflammation excited induces gangrenous mischief, vesicles, filled with q, bloody fluid, arising on the part. CAUSES. Chilblains are apt to be brought on by the sud- den application of heat to a part, which has been exposed to cold, as well as by the sudden exposure of a warmed part to the cold. When the part is in a state of perspiration at the time of being thus exposed, chilblains are still more likely to happen. The complaint most readily occurs, when the skin is tender, and irritable, and not accustomed to the cold. Hence, children, young persons, and women who have been brought up in a very delicate manner, are most frequently afflicted.

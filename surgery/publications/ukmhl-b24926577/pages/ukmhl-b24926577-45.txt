37 amputation:. Amputation of the Tore-arm. 1. As much of this part must be preserved as possible, the incision being made no higher than is absolutely necessary. 2. The tourniquet is to be applied a little above the elbow, with the pad upon the artery at the inner edge of the biceps muscle. 3. The circular incision through the skin is to be made with a small amputating knife, while an assistant draws the integuments up- wards : a very moderate detachment of them from the fascia is requisite. The division of the muscles is to be done with the edo-e of the O knife inclined upward; the parts between the radius and ulna are to be cut with a catling, or a double-edged scalpel; and the bones sawn through. 4. The radial, ulnar, and interosseous ar- teries, are those which usually require the li- gature. 5. One half of each ligature having been cut off, the edges of the wound are to be so brought together, as to form a mere line across the face of the stump. They are to be kept in this position with strips of adhesive plaster, &c.

The two incisions are to meet accurately above, anil be perfectly straight, so that the wound may be compared, in shape, with the letter V inverted. * 4. The edges of the cleft having thus been converted into bleeding surfaces, the opposite sides of the wound are to be brought into con- tact with each other. 5. The maintenance of them in this posi- tion, until they have grown together, is the next indication. This is fulfilled, by passing two pins, constructed for the purpose, through the sides of the wound. The pin nearest the red part of the lip is to be first introduced, while the greatest care is taken, that the two portions of the lip accurately correspond, and meet each other, without the appearance of the least deformity. The pin is to be pushed in about one-twelfth of an inch from the bleeding surface, and is to pass obliquely about two-thirds of the way through the thickness of the lip.

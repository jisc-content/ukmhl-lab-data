Above all things, the surgeon should refrain from being led to puncture the tumor by the feel of a fluctuation. While the skin remains whole, the advance of the distem- per is generally slow. No sooner is there an opening in the integuments, than the fungous mass projects, rapidly acquires a frightful mag- nitude, and quickly destroys the patient. The growth of such a fungus often cannot be repressed by the most powerful caustics, and can never be effectually extirpated by them.

*57 HYDROCELE. of fluid which take place in cysts in the course of the spermatic cord, and from other aqueous accumulations, which sometimes occur in old hernial sacs. The term of hydrocele by injiltration has been applied to the oedema of the scrotum. The hydrocele of the tunica vaginalis is called congenital, when the cavity of that membrane is open at its upper part into the abdomen. SYMPTOMS OF THE COMMON HYDROCELE. The swelling begins at the lower part of the scrotum, and gradually mounts upwards in front of the spermatic cord, nearly to the abdominal ring. Its progress is slow, so that it is generally six or eight months before it attains the foregoing height. The tumor has an oblong pyriform shape, being more volumi- nous below, than above. The corrugations of the scrotum are no longer visible, and the raphe is always pushed towards the sound side. A distinct fluctuation may be felt on putting the fingers on one side of the tumor, and gently tapping at the point which is diametri- cally opposite. Lastly, when the tunica vagi- nalis is not much thickened, and the fluid not turbid, the swelling presents a transparent appearance, on placing a candle behind it. s

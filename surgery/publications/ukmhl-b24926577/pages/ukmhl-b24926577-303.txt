OPHTHALMY. 29o u 4 cilage of quince-seeds, and a few drops of cam- phorated spirit. The tinctura thebaica may be dropped into the eye, or die inside of die eye- lids may be smeared with Janinâ€™s ophthalmic ointment, which Scarpa so highly commends; or, with the ung. hydrarg. nitrat. weakened. 7. Certain ophthalmies depend upon particu- lar avocations. The eyes of nightmen are fre- quently inflamed, in consequence of being much exposed to noxious gases. It is the same with workmen employed at lime-kilns, or in break- ing any calcareous matter, the minute particles of which get upon the conjunctiva, and become a cause of irritation. Cases of this kind may be easily relieved, by the patient leaving off'his work for a time, and washing his eyes with any common collyrium. 8. When an ophthalmy arises from a disor- dered state of the abdominal viscera, the cause is indicated by a loss of appetite, nausea, bit- terness in the mouth, a yellow furred tongue, violent head-ach, &c. The treatment demands the prompt exhibition of an emetic, and after- wards cooling and aperient medicines. Uiclic- rand advises the topical means merely to consist of a resolvent fomentation. Perhaps there is here no reason for making the local treatment -at all different from that of ordinary cases of acute ophthalmy.

188 GANGLION'. a scirrhus lias ulcerated, it emits a fungus of a very hard texture. Such excrescence, how- ever, is itself at last destroyed by the ulcera- tion. Cancerous sores, also, frequently put on, for a short time, an appearance in some places of cicatrization. On the other hand, the fungus hcematodes, while of moderate size, is a soft elastic swelling, with an equal surface, and a deceitful feel of fluctuation. It is, in general, quite circumscribed, being in- cluded within a capsule. The substance of the tumor, instead of being for the most part hard, consists of a soft, pulpy, medullary matter, which readily mixes with water.

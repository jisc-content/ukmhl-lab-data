589 WOUNDS. c c 3 which respiration must be principally carried on. Avenbrugger first noticed another sign of an extravasation of blood in the chest, namelv, the kind of sound heard on striking the thorax, which cavity is said to make a peculiar hollow noise, on being struck when there is no extravasation; but, a dull one, when blood is effused. The French attach importance to this criterion; Corvisart is stated to have derived great assistance from it; though, we believe, in this country, the method is more likely to excite smiles, than imitation. Blood, extravasated in the cavity of the pleura, is not only a mechanical obstacle to breathing, it acts also as a source of irri- tation, sometimes inducing abscesses. The necessity, therefore, of giving issue to the effused fluid is very urgent, since its presence gives rise to so much disorder, and may even bring on fatal consecpiences. In inconsider- able extravasations, indeed, it has been found, that repeated bleedings, and low diet, have sufficed for the relief of the symptoms, and the dispersion of the extravasated blood. Success from such general means alone can be expected only in very slight cases, and in most instances, it is best to give vent to the effused fluid. When the wound is situated at a depending part of the cavity of the thorax,

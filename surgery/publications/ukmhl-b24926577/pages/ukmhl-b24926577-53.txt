ANEURISM. 4 r, teraal and internal aneurisms, that there was, in reality, only one kind and form of the disease, namely, that proceeding from a solution ol con- tinuity, or rupture of the proper coats of the artery, and from an effusion of blood into the cellular substance. He maintains, that he has found out, in the most certain and unequivocal manner, that the solution of continuity is some- times occasioned by a wound, a steatomatous earthy degeneration, an ulceration, or a rupture, of the internal and muscular coats of the artery. He contends, that the concurrence of a preter- natural dilatation of these coats is not essential to the formation of the disease; that every aneu- rism, whether it be internal or external, cir- cumscribed or diffused, is always formed by effusion; and that the internal and muscular coats have not the smallest share in the forma- tion of the hernial sac. This being the truth, the long-venerated division of aneurisms into true, false, and mixedy must be rejected as erroneous. The distinctions must now be into external and internal, circinn- â– scribcd and diffused, recent and inveterate. The venous aneurisms, and the aneurism from ana- stomosis, are cases of a peculiar kind, as we shall soon explain.

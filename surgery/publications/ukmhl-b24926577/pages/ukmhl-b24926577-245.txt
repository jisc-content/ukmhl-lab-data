The strangulation may exist in both places at once. The possibility also of the stricture, being occasionally produced by a thickening of the neck of the hernial sac is now generally acknowledged. In certain cases, the hernia enters the above-described canal, but is not protruded through the ring. A stran- gulation may in such instances be made by the margin of the internal oblique and trans- verse muscles. In some rare bubonoceles, the viscera pass directly under the edge of the transverse muscle, and through the abdominal ring. Such a case may occur, when the fascia transversalis is weak, does not exist at all, or is broken. In this species of hernia, the epi- gastric artery is situated on the outside of the mouth of the sac, and runs at the distance of about three quarters of an inch from the upper and outer extremity of the abdominal ring. The sac is not covered by the cremaster, as in common instances. The case has been distin- guished by the name of ventro-inguinal hernia. Forty-nine, out of fifty ruptures in men, are estimated to be bubonoceles. In women, such herni* are rather unfrequent. The nature of 4

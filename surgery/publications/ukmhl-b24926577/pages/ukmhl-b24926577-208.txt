GANGRENE. 200 jured, and irritated by any sort of applications. It is idle and vain to talk of reanimating the parts with spirits, balsams, &c. to prevent them from being affected with mortification. It is equally absurd, to tbink of hindering them from falling into a state of putridity by anti- septics. Therefore, the most enlightened sur- geons generally consider soft emollient poul- tices as good an application as cap be used; though, since the charcoal and ordinary fer- menting poultice, are not materially stimu- lating, not much objection can be made to their employment. Making incisions and scarifica- tions into gangrenous parts can do no good, if they are merely made into the sloughs; and, if they extend through the dead to the living flesh, they are not only likely to effect no ra- tional purpose, but, must be productive of pain, hemorrhage, and frequently of fresh sloughing. However, when a slough is large, and a part of it is loose, the cutting away of such portion is commendable on the principle of lessening the fetor. Were also much sanies, to lodge under a slough, a careful incision through the dead part might he useful in af- fording an exit to the matter. This proceeding, however, can rarely be right or necessary, and ran be justified on no principle whatsoever.

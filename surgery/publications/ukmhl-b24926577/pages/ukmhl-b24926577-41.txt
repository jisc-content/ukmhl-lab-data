A cross bandage is then to be laid upon the end of the stump, and retained there by a roller, the application of which is to begin round the waist, and be carried spirally down- ward to the extremity of the stump. Some now put over the whole a woollen night-cap, which, to say the best of it, is useless. The patient is to be put in bed, have the stump gently supported with a small pillow, and take about forty drops of the tinctura opii. Amputation of the Leg. 1.

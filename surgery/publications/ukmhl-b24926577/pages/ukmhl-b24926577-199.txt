191 GANGRENE. rion of the swelling, the surgeon is justified in extirpating the disease with a knife. 1 he chief tilings to be observed are, to cut out the cyst entire, without wounding it, or leaving any particle of it behind ; to bring the edges of the wound together with sticking-plaster; and to apply a compress and roller over the dressings. GANGRENE. Bv gangrene, or mortification, surgeons al- ways mean the death of a part of the body; or the conversion of such part into a black, fetid, cold, insensible mass, with which the general, nervous, and vascular systems no longer have any organic connexion. The varieties of mor- tification are as numerous as the causes of the disorder. It follows inflammation, attended with violence, or weakness. It may pro- ceed from a gradual decay of the vital powers induced by old age; it may be the ef- fect of the supply of blood to parts being cut off; or of the return of such fluid towards the heart being stopped; it may arise from an ex- cessive contusion, or concussion; it may de- pend upon deleterious internal causes; the application of caustic, or of great degrees of heat or cold to parts.

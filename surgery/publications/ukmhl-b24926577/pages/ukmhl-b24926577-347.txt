ULCERS OF THE LEGS. 339 z 2 charge, and the bandage is to be methodically applied from the toes to the knee. 12. A very excellent and successful method of treating indolent ulcers of the leg was in- troduced by Mr. Baynton. It consists in en- circling the limb and the ulcer with long broadish strips of adhesive plaster, which are to be of such length as to pass round the member, and leave an end of about four or five inches. The centre of each strip is to be applied to the sound part of the limb, opposite to the inferior portion of the ulcer, in such a manner, that tlie lower edge of the plaster may be placed about an inch below the lower margin of the ulcer. The ends of the plaster are then to be drawn over the ulcer with as much force as can be done without pain. In this way, the rest of the strips are to be applied, till the whole sore, and two or three inches of the in- teguments above it, are covered. The member is then to have pieces of soft calico laid over it, and is to have a bandage applied from the toes to the knee. When the parts are inflamed, the discharge is profuse, or the plasters create irritation on being removed, these and the bandage are to be kept wet with cold spring water. By this plan, the worst cases may ge- nerally be cured without pain or confinement. A great recommendation of the method arises

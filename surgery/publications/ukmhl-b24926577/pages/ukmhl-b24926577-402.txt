The application of them in these cases is called gastroraphe, about which more has been said and written than seems ne- cessary, The omentum, like intestine, demands immediate reduction, it sound. When morti- fied, the dead portion is to be cut off, and the bleeding vessels tied singly with a bit of thread.

Gun- shot wounds, complicated with fractured bones, are of a very dangerous nature, and frequently require amputation. Bullets, less commonly than cannon-balls, and bomb-shells, occasion such injury. In sea-engagements, highly peril- ous wounds are produced by the splinters of wood, which are driven about, on a cannon-ball striking the vessel. Many cases, of this sort, attended with a comminuted fracture, and vast contusion and laceration of the soft parts, demand the immediate performance of ampu- tation.

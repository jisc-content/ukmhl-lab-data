4.1 AMPUTATION, eased part. Wlien the morbid affection is con- fined to the glans penis, and the incision can be made closely behind the corona glandis, the integuments and corpora cavernosa may be cut through with one sweep of the knife. Som^ advise a portion of skin to be saved, for covering the end of the stump; and, therefore, they direct a mere circular incision through the integu- ments to be first executed; after which, they are to be pushed up towards the pubes, before the corpora cavernosa are cut. Others object to this plan, as tedious and unnecessary, be- cause the latter parts retract after the operation to so great a degree as to create a redundance of skin. Perhaps the best method is to be content with pushing the skin towards the pubes, at the time of cutting completely through the penis at once. 3. When the amputation is done close to the symphysis pubis, the corpora cavernosa are apt to retract excessively, and leave such a quan- tity of skin projecting, as to make it difficult to discover and secure the bleeding vessels. Here, it is better to take away a good deal of skin, by drawing it towards the glans, before cutting through the part. 4. \\ hen the arteries of the corpora caver- nosa are not morbidly enlarged, and the am- putation has been done near the glans, com-

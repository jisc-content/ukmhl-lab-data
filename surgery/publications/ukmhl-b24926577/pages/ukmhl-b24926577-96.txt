Cancer has generally, till very lately, been confounded with the fungus haunatodes, which always recurs, unless the incisions be made at a considerable distance from the ob- vious distemper. When Dr. A. Monro only found four cases out of sixty, where he had cut away the disease, remain well two years, we must suspect that some particles of the disorder must have been left behind. The appearance of a cancer elsewhere proves ■nothing to the point, as no reason prevails, why the previous existence of a local disease in one situation, should render its origin in another impossible. It may be observed, also, that the occurrence is not usual. When a re- lapse happens, it is gcnerally'dn the same part, and, as we suspect, from some particles of the distemper being frequently left behind, and, perhaps, in some cases, from the continued operation of those inscrutable causes, which first gave rise to the disease. We have relations of surprising success at- tending the extirpation of cancers. Mr. Nooth cut away one hundred and two, and all the cases got well. Mr. Hill performed eighty-eight operations, with hardly any fai- lures. We are willing, however, to admit, ♦Jiat many of the instances in question might

DISLOCATIONS. 126 geons should be cautious not to let the crepitus, made by the friction of the olecranon and coro- noid process against the humerus, deceive them into a belief, that the olecranon is broken. As the mistake would not be found out, till after the swelling had subsided, an anchylosis would be the consequence. For the reduction of this case, one assistant is to hold the arm, and another the wrist. The surgeon is to take hold of the elbow with both his hands, his fingers being applied round the lower end of the humerus, while his thumbs are employed in pushing back the olecranon into its natural situation. When this has been effected, the 'reduction is complete. The patient should be bled, be put on low diet, have cold saturnine lotions applied round the joint, and, if neces- sary, leeches. When the inflammation and swelling of the joint are abated, the elbow is to be bent and extended a little every day, in order to prevent anchylosis. The fore-arm i* to be quietly supported in a sling. The dislocation forwards is accompanied with a fracture of the olecranon. The heads of the bones having been reducedv the rest of the treatment resembles that of the broken olecra- non. There is much danger of an anchylosis, in consequence of the long time, during which it is necessary to keep the joint motionless. ! : :* - " -j\\ I|I|Â»I Nil mil .

One part of the swelling assumes a more elevated conical appearance than the rest, and the abscess is now said to point. The skin in this place is whiter and thinner than elsewhere; the matter indeed being often plainly visible under the cu- ticle.—5. When the abscess does not lie too deeply, a fluctuation of its purulent contents may be felt on handling two opposite points of the swelling. CAUSES. Abscesses are the consequence of an inflam- mation, which rises above a certain pitch, and puts the vessels of the part into a state, in which they form pus, by a process analogous to secre- * tion. Therefore, any thing which has the effect of giving rise to inflammation, may be the cause of suppuration, or an abscess. In some consti- tutions, collections of matter will arise from slighter causes, than in other habits, in which so great a tendency to inflammation does not prevail. Hence, in one patient, a blow may bring on high inflammatory symptoms, which terminate in an abscess; while, in another per- son, a similar injury may merely create a little soreness and inflammation. As the occasional causes of acute abscesses are the same as those of

ABSCESSES. 3 in the sinus, followed by inflammation, &c.; blows upon the cheek; carious teeth; inflam- mation of the pituitary membrane from violent colds, See. TREATMENT. 1. Every abscess of the antrum, as soon as its existence is known, should be opened without the least delay, lest great part of the upper jaw- bone be destroyed by caries and absorption, and the cure be rendered impossible, till after an immense time. The best plan of making such an opening into the antrum, as will answer the purpose of hindering an accumulation of matter, is to ex- tract the third or fourth grinding tooth, count- ing from before backward, and, if necessary, to pierce, the bottom of its socket with some such instrument as a small gimlet, so as to make a free aperture into the antrum above. When any grinding tooth is carious, its ex- traction is to be preferred to that of a sound one. Indeed, success generally requires the removal of every carious tooth, whose fangs approach the seat of the disease. 2. After the matter has been let out, a little stopper, or tent, should be put into the opening, and taken out once a day, for the purpose of giv- ing vent to the discharge. 3. The cavity of the antrum may also be washed out with a little warm milk and water.

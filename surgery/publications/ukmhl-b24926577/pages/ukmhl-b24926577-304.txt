296 OPHTHALMY. 9. The scrofulous ophthalmy is seldom acute, almost always putting on the chronic form. The case may be suspected from the inflamma- tion of the eye being attended with other symptoms more decidedly strumous. The treatment advised by Scarpa is, after having emptied the prim as vise with small repeated doses of the kali tartarizatum and emetic tartar, to administer tonic medicines, such as bark and the volatile tincture of guaiacum, witn a'thiops mineralis, aqua calcis, &c. the doses of which last are to be taken in warm broth, every day, for several months. Sea-bathing, and rubbing the body with flannel, are also recommended. Mild astringent collyria, and the tinctura the- baica, are the best loeal applications. 10. The ophthalmy proceeding from a vene- real cause, as well as the inflammation of the eyes, supposed to arise from the sudden stop- page of a gonorrhoea, and attended with a vast tumefaction of the conjunctiva, and a purulent discharge from the inside of the eyelids, are cases, in which colly ria, containing the hy- drargyrus muriatus, are often prescribed. Mer- cury is also given internally, though without much reason in the latter example. -Anothei questionable measure is that, so generally ad- vised, of irritating the urethra, in order to pro- duce the gonorrhoea again.

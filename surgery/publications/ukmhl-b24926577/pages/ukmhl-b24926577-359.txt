The frictions have the most effect when made along the inside of the limbs, where anatomy shows that the lymphatics exist most numerously. It is always a prudent maxim to begin a course of mercury in a very gentle way, only small quantities of the ointment being at first em- ployed. Perhaps, half a dram is enough to begin with. Nor need the frictions be made every day, until the ability of the consti- tution to bear the medicine has been tried.

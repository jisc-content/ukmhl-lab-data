Unfortunately, the period, at which the absorption of the virus begins, is so uncertain, that the foregoing method is scarcely pver deserving of such implicit reliance, that mercury need not be employed at all. We have many times destroyed small pustules and ulcer- ated points on the penis, and effected a lasting cure, without any mercury. We have grati- fied ourselves with the belief, that these cases were venereal, and that absorption was wholly prevented. Possibly, some of these examples might not have been incipient chancres, and we were deceived. Richerand affirms, that lie lias often cured chancres with caustics, with- out exhibiting mercury, and that, as no subse- quent symptoms ensued, the cure appeared to be radical.

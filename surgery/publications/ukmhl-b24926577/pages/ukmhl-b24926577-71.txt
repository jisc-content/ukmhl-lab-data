63 BLADDER, PUNCTURE OF. precise direction with respect to the axis of the body, ever to be depended upon. 4. Endeavours have been made to obviate such objections, by dividing the skin with a knife, so as to be able to feel the distended bladder, before attempting to tap it. But, troublesome abscesses, between the bladder and wounded integuments, have made it doubt- ful, whether the latter innovation merits the name of an improvement. 5. A very strong reason against the method is, that the operation must, in most instances, be done close to the seat of those causes, on which the retention of urine depends. When the prostate gland is diseased, it is not proper. When the neck of the bladder is inflamed, it is not advisable. In the last sort of case, gan- grenous and fatal consequences have been known to follow its performance. Another objection to it is, that it obliges the patient to keep his bed, the whole time of wearing the cannula. 6. On the whole, we may set down this operation as generally less eligible, than either of the two following. Were a retention of urine, however, complicated both with an en- largement ot the prostate, and a thickened contracted bladder, perhaps, the puncture from the perineum might have advantages.

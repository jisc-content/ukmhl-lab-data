They have shown, that a beverage, merely acidulated with nitric, or muriatic acid, dis- solves with still greater quickness calculi, formed of the phosphate of lime, and of the ammoniaco-magnesian phosphate. They have made out, that calculi, composed of the oxa- late of lime, which are the most diiiicult of dissolution, may be softened, and almost quite dissolved, in nitric acid, greatly diluted with water, provided they are kept in the mixture a sufficient time. As Richerand remarks, these discoveries might not be useless, if the chemical composition of the calculus were always known, and the bladder could bear the introduction of these active liquids into its cavity, 7. Lithotomy, or the operation of cutting into the bladder, and extracting the stone, has been executed in an immense variety of man- ners. We shall here only describe the method usually adopted in England ; the plan preferred in France; and the manner of making the

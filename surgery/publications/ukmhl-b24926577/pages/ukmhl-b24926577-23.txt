ABSCESSES. 15 the abscess. The design of the operation is to divide the rectum from the verge of the anus, as high as the top of the hollow, in which the mat- ter is formed, so as to lay the two cavities of the gut and abscess into one. Thus an open sore will be made, which will heal, while the hollow sinuous one would not. 8. The curved, probe-pointed knife, is the most useful for the purpose. This introduced into the sinus, while the surgeon’s fore-finger is in the rectum, will enable him to divide all that will require division. If there be no opening in the intestine, the smallest degree of force will thrust the point of the knife through, and make one. If there be one already, the same point will find and pass through it. In cither case, it will be received by the finger in ano, and being brought out by it, must necessarily divide all that is between the edge of the knife and the verge of the anus. 9• Immediately after the operation, a soft dos- sil of lint is to be introduced, from the rectum between the lips of the incision, as well to re- press any slight hemorrhage, as to prevent any immediate closure of the wound. The rest of the dressings are to be light. 10. The first dressing should be allowed to remain until a beginning suppuration renders it loose enough to be taken away with ease; and

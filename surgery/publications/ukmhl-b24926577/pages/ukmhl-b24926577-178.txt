FRACTURES. 170 its ends are to be made to cross, first, upon the instep, and then upon the sole. Then they are to be conducted outwards, one being passed through the mortise, and tied with the other in a knot upon the niche, with sufficient force to pull the lower part of the femur downwards, and propel the splint upwards, and, of course, the upper piece of the broken bone and the pelvis. A se- cond splint was next laid along the inside of the limb from the pelvis to some distance beyond the foot. A third splint was now applied, reaching from the abdomen to the knee. The upper ends of the external and front splints were fixed by a bandage, which went round the pelvis. Tiie foot was kept from moving by a roller, the middle of which was applied to the sole, while the ends were made 10 cross upon the instep, and then were fastened to the splints.â€”Of the bent position, it may be al- leged, that it does not procure so beneficial a relaxation of the muscles, as Pott and others have represented; and a strong-objection to it, arises from the manner in v hich it leaves the knee, leg, and foot, unsupported and move- able. Such parts of the limb cannot be moved, without a most hurtful disturbance and dis- placement of the fracture being produced. 8. In fractures of the leg, both its bones are mostly broken together. Sometimes, however,

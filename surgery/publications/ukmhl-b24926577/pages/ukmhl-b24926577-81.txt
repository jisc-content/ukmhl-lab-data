bronchocele. 75 Cellular substance,, and has a plainly emphyse- matous feel. If it be opened, the air escapes, and the tumor subsides. Here, we must sup- pose the air gets into the gland from the wind- pipe in some way, or another. This species of the disease is probably not of long duration, as the air must be absorbed. By violent exertions, while the breath is held; by forcible coughing, &c.; a rent is said to be sometimes produced in the membrane between two of the cartilaginous hoops of the trachea, so as to let the air enter the cellular membrane around the thyroid gland. The same causes are stated likewise sometimes to push out a portion of the membranous lining of the tra- chea into a sort of pouch. The tumor is highly elastic, and disappears under pressure. Some- times the bronchocele actually proceeds from a dilatation of the blood-vessels of the thyroid gland. Here, stoppage of the menses and pregnancies are alleged to be often concerned as causes. Scrofula sometimes evidently prevails in patients, who have bronchoceles. Both dis- orders are also often benefited by similar medi- cines. Yet, scrofula may not be entitled to the rank of a cause; and certain it is, that many patients, with enlarged thyroid glands, have no vestiges of the other disease.

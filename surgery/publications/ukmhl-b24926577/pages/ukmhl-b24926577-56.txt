ANEURISM. 43 abscesses having Cj^sts approaching some great artery. CAUSES. While the doctrine of true aneurisms beinor morbid dilatations of the coats of the artery existed, it was supposed that the affected part Of the vessel yielded, and became distended by the impetus of the blood into a sac. That a mere weakness of this sort, at any part of an artery, is not the cause of aneurism, has been well ascertained. Hunter and Home stripped off the outer coats of arteries ; but no aneuris- mal swellings ensued. We firmly believe, with Scarpa, that the proxi- mate cause of aneurisms is always a wound, rupture, or ulceration, of the proper coats of the artery. The cause of this rupture, in sponta- neous aneurisms, is some violent exertion, com- bined for the most part, with a congenital relax- ation, or with a steatomatous ulcerated change of some portion of the proper coats of the artery, and more particularly of the inner coat. What Scarpa terms the steatomatous, squamousy ulcerated disorganization of the proper coats of the arteries, takes place sometimes in one point only of the artery, sometimes in several places, and at different distances from each other, in the whole course of the affected vessels.

ABSCESSES. 50 Should they break, notwithstanding this method, the opening should be covered with a pledget, and be by no means enlarged. 6. The making of an opening into the ab- scess can seldom, however, be delayed, till the whole of the hardness is gone, and must gene- rally be performed, when most of the induration has disappeared. A small puncture with a lancet will be quite sufficient, and it should be made as far as possible from the nipple. All the matter should not be pressed out. A little bit of lint may be put between the lips of the wound, and taken out two or three times a day, .to let the matter escape. As long as much dis- charge and induration prevail, emollients are to be continued; but afterwards, common dress- ings. 7. Sometimes, after an opening has been made, several other spontaneous apertures are formed, and emit matter. Sometimes the abscess be* comes fistulous, attended with a degree of indu- ration, and a thin fetid discharge. Here, the hardness nulst be dispersed by applyinghemlock poultices, and then the fistula will heal. In other instances, a milky fluid continues to be discharged, though no hardness remains. Here the treatment should be a spare diet, gentle com- pression of the breast, and mild evacuations. H. The indurations, left after milk abscesses.

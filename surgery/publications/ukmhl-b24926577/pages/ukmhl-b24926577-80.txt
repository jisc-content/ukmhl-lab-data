Air has been observed in some bronchoceles, as well as passages, through which it had passed from the trachea into the thyroid gland. From some effort, in carrying a burden on the head, the windpipe has been suspected of having given way, so as to let the air pass into the gland, and make it swell. We cannot discern the least probability of this surmise being accurate. In the generality of enlarged thyroid glands, no air at all exists. Many tumors of this kind obviously contain a fluid, and have an oede- matous feel. Why should not carrying a bur- den on the back, also, bring on the affection?

An interruption to the passage of the secretion of the thyroid gland into the trachea has been suspected. We have no certainty, however, that it secretes any thing at all. Particular bronchoceles have been found to contain air. These are said to be of three kinds. Sometimes the swelling consists merely of air in the thyroid gland and surrounding

70 BROXCHOCELE. or less, towards each side of the neck. Some- times, its base continues small, while the rest enlarges. In time, the swelling may attain an enormous magnitude. The bronchocele has its seat in the tliy roid gland. However, the adjacent cellular sub- stance also in general, contributes to the tumor. The hardness not unfrequently affects the neigh- bouring glands; in which circumstance, the swelling often reaches from oue side of the neck to the other, and insensibly loses itself in the surrounding parts, instead of being dis- tinctly circumscribed, as is usually the case. Sometimes, only one lobe of the gland is en- larged. Sometimes, there is a mere induration, of the cellular substance in the vicinity. The true bronchocele is entirely a local disease, the patient being generally in other respects quite well. Nor, indeed, excepting the deformity, are any local complaints induced. However, pa- tients, with large bronchoceles, frequently have an asthmatic respiration, and hoarseness. When the tumor meets with external resistance also, it is apt to press upon the subjacent parts, and induce difficulty of breathing and swallowing, and even apoplectic symptoms. Bronchoceles are not at all of a malignant nature; nor are they prone to inflammation; though some few instances have been observed to suppurate and ulcerate.

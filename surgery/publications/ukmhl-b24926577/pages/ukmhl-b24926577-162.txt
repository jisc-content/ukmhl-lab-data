FRACTURES. 1.54 comminuted. When the case is attended with injury of a large artery, nerve, &c. it is named a complicated fracture. The difference of these cases may chiefly be referred to the particularity of the broken bone, the situation of the fracture on the bone, the direction of the solution of continuity, the re- spective position of the fragments, and circum- stances rendering the accident simple, com- pound, See. Fractures may be oblique, or trans- verse ; but, according to Petit, never longitu- dinal, since any cause capable of producing a solution of continuity lengthwise, can much more readily produce it transversely. The bones may be broken by causes acting immediately upon them, or by counter-blows where the force has been applied at some distance from the in- jury. The bones are more or less subject to be broken according to their position, their office, and the age or youth of the patient. Some diseases increase the fragility and weakness of the bones, and thereby facilitate the occurs rence of fractures. The only certain marks of fractures are derived from palpable alterations accompanying such accidents, as deformity, a shortening of the limb, a crepitus arising from the ends of the bone rubbing against each other. The prognosis is unfavourable in propor- tion as the bone has numerous strong muscles

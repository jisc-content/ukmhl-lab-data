Here the acromion does not form a projection, under which a depression may be felt iu the natural situation of the head of the humerus. The upper part of the shoulder retams its prominent form ; the depression is lov er down ; the irregular end of the lower portion of the bone may be felt in the axilla; ant! a crepitus on moving the limb. The French treat fractures of the neck of the humerus much in the same way as fractures of the cla- vicle. The upper end of the lower portion of the bone is kept outwards by confining the elbow against the side. Before putting the wedge-shaped compress in the axilla, however, a roller is applied to the whole limb, In this Country, the treatment of fractures of the neck of the humerus does not differ from that of other fractures of this bone.

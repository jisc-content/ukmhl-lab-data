Compression is contra-indicated, when- ever the popliteal aneurism is spontaneous, or not depending upon a wound, or stretching of the artery; when it is of long standing, and prodigious size; when it is very hard; when it occasions acute pain and sympathetic fever, great swelling and coldness of the leg and foot; or when the aneurismal sac lies too high, or too low, in the ham. 4. The plan of putting compression in exe- cution is to lay compresses over the aneurismal swelling, and another long one upon the track of the femoral artery, and then apply a roller to the limb from the toes to the groin. The bandage is to be frequently moistened with vinegar and water; its application is to be made tighter every time it is renewed; and, in pro- portion as the swelling diminishes, the number of compresses is to be increased, so that the narrowest may enter the hollow of the ham, and press on the artery above the opening in it, while the others operate on the vessel, with- out pressing too much on the hamstrings, and calf of the ley.

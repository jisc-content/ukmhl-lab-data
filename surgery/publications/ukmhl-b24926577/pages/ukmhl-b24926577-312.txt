PILES. 304 be no doubt, that in many, and probably in most cases, they are formed by an effusion of blood under the lining of the rectum, the membrane alone of this intestine, and not the coats of the vein, forming the covering of the tumor. This statement seems to derive confirmation from the following circumstances. Piles are sometimes as large as a walnut, or an apple. It is scarcely conceivable, that a mere varix can attain this magnitude. Fre- quently, on cutting away piles, even of large size, little or no bleeding ensues. Were they dilatations of veins, a considerable hemor- rhage would inevitably happen. A pile occa- sionally quite collapses, a thing which could hardly occur, were the tumor a part of a blood-vessel. Piles sometimes have various shapes, which the dilatation of a vein could not put on, and, after being removed and exa- mined, they are found to have only one cover- ing. 2. Some piles are situated quite on the out- side of the anus; some are surrounded by the fibres of the sphincter; and others lie above this muscle. In the last of these cases, the}* seldom produce serious inconvenience; but, in the other examples, they are apt to occasion painful symptoms, when inflamed, or constricted by the sphincter ani. 4

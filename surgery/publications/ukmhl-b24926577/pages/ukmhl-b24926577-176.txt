FRACTURES. 1(58 attendants make the extension at the ankle: When the fracture is transverse, two splints, furnished with proper pads, compresses, &c. and reaching along the side of the limb, from the pelvis to a little beyond the sole of the foot, will serve to prevent displacement, and keep the ends of the fracture steady, until they are firmly united. When, however, the frac-> turc is oblique, or the neck of the bone is broken, the principle of continued extension becomes necessary. The most perfect appa- ratus for this purpose is undoubtedly that, which was invented by the great Desault. He saw, that, in oblique fractures of the thigh- bone, and in fractures of its neck, the diffi- culty of maintaining the reduction proceeded from the action of muscles drawing upwards the lower portion of the broken bone, while the upper fragment was propelled downwards by the weight of the body, which made the bed sink, lie saw that every apparatus should operate, so as to prevent such descent of the pelvis and upper fragment, as well as the as- cent of the lower one, while it should also have the power of preventing any rotation of the lower part of the limb. In short, he perceived that the grand thing to be aimed at, was some plan, in which the foot, leg, thigh, and pelvis, should form but one whole, the different parts

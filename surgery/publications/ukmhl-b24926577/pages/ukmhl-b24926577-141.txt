133 DISLOCATIONS. backwards, a motion which is promoted by the j flexion of the thigh upon the pelvis. In this i consecutive luxation, the knee and toes are turned inwards, and the limb seems shortened from being bent. A primitive dislocation Hi downwards and backwards, is rare: it some- ji times is a consequence of disease of the hip- [j joint. The method of reduction is much the same ' in these four kinds of dislocation. In short, â€¢ in the displacement upwards and backwards, lit downwards and inwards, &c. the first thing : is always to apply a folded cloth over the bend |l(of the groin on the sound side. The ends are ; tto be carried obliquely towards the haunch of 1 tthe same side, and held by several assistants. Another long narrow folded cloth is to be ap- I plied transversely upon the crista of the ilium of the affected side, and its ends are to be car- fried horizontally to the opposite side of the l^pelvis, where the assistants are to take hold of |them. These are the counter-extending means, j1 the second serving to keep the pelvis from | inclining towards the affected side, anti yielding |to the extending power. The cloth for making '.the extension is to be folded and applied round jtthe limb just above the knee, or, as the French [prefer, round the ankle, as far as possible from .the resistance. A force must be exerted pro-

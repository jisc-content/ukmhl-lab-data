Â£Q5 gonorrhoea. TREATMENT. 1. The first stage of gonorrhoea is clearly of an inflammatory nature. Wrapping the penis up in linen, wet with the saturnine lotion, using a weak injection of the same quality, keeping the bowels open, and giving a grain of opium at night, seem proper measures. 2. When sympathetic buboes occur, leeches and the saturnine lotion ought to be applied to them. When retention of urine comes on, the warm bath, and opiate glysters, are strongly in- dicated. When chordee and painful erections happen, opium and camphor are the medicines, from which relief is to be sought. 3. After about a wreek, when the first in- flammatory stage begins to abate a little, the saturnine injection may be changed for one containing the zincum vitriolatum, in the pro- portion of about six grains to four ounces of water. This may be used thrice a day. 4. In the latter stage of gonorrhoea, when the discharge from the urethra is almost the only complaint, the strength of the preceding injection may be increased, or one made by dis- solving a grain of the hydrargyrus muriatus in six ounces of distilled water may be employed. Twenty, or thirty drops of the balsam, copaib. may also be given, two or three times a day.

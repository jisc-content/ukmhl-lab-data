WOUNDS. 374 ceedingly general, from an idea, that by cutting open the orifice of the wound, the extiaction of foreign bodies, and the escape of matter and sloughs, were facilitated, while all constric- tion of the parts was obviated, in the event of great swelling taking place. The dilatation is by some surgeons totally condemned, while others admit its utility, where a ball has passed through a very fleshy part, which is covered by a thick aponeurosis. Here the practice is defended on the principle of removing all ten- sion of the aponeurosis, so that the swollen muscles may not suffer such constriction, as might terminate in gangrenous mischief. Riche- rand advises the fascia to be slit open, to the extent of several inches, with a probe-pointed bistoury, ami dilating the wound as deeply as possible. On what principle this last pro- ceeding is necessary, is not clearly explained* Some surgeons, after dilating gunshot wounds, have drawn setons through them, in order to fa- cilitate the escape of the matter and sloughs. A seton, however, acts like a foreign bod>, produces considerable pain, irritation, and inflammatory swelling, and is, therefore, hurt- ful. It must rather obstruct, than promote the escape of sloughs ; nor can it be necessary for promoting the exit of the mattei, since gunshot wounds are not much disposed to

DISLOCATIONS. 1£9 (extended. After what has been said, the par- ticulars of the reduction of this accident seem unnecessary. In all these cases, means for the prevention and diminution of inflammation are : requisite. C&.v}iC/$ With respect to the bones of the -tarsus, they bare so small, and so strongly tied together with ligaments, that they can hardly be dislocated. llThe os magnum can alone be considered subject to the accident. It may be pushed backwards out of the deep cavity, formed for its reception. iJThen it causes.a tumor, on the back of the hand, •when this is half bent. Sucli tumor, however, [disappears when the hand is extended. A per- tfect reduction and cure of this dislocation are difficult; but no material inconveniences ensue. The metacarpal bones, and those of the fin- :gers, are not very subject to dislocations. The }5rst phalanx of the thumb is rather more ex- posed to the accident backwards. The case is jceadily distinguished by the deformity and im- moveable condition of the thumb. The bone s to be immediately pushed back into its na- Iiural place. The hand is to be kept in a sling*, nd the saturnine lotion is to be applied. Some »refer applying soap-plaster, and longitudinal (its of pasteboard, to the fingers and thumb, j lifter their luxations have been reduced. 5. Notwithstanding the depth of the aceta- K

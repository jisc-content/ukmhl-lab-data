121 DISLOCATIONS. case is so common, that some writers think, with Hippocrates, that all primitive dislocations tof the humerus happen in that direction, and ithat the head of the bone is only carried for- 'wards in a consecutive manner. The capsular ligament of the shoulder-joint is weakest and itleast supported below. Here it is ruptured, when the head of the bone glides downwards jooff the glenoid cavity, and presses upon it. The head of the bone is strictly pushed through ;the inferior and internal part of the capsule, so as to be thrown into the axilla, against the texternal edge of the scapula, between thq issubscapulaiis muscle, and tendon of the long ahead of the triceps. A luxation of the humerus jidownwards cannot happen, except when the jeelbow is separated from the trunk. In this condition, falls and blows act upon the bone, .as a long lever, and can easily push its head 1 downwards, through the inferior and internal part of the capsule, into the hollow of the axilla. The instinctive action of the great pec- toral, dorsal, and other muscles, when a person falls, has also generally a share a facilitating the accident. Deformity of the shoulder, a ({projection of the acromion, a preternatural de- gression below it, an obliquity of the arm out- I wards, a separation of the elbow from the t trunk, and a circumscribed, round, very hard

When a foreign body gets into the bladder, it becomes the nucleus of a stone. Yet, fre- quently, no appearance, which would lead to the foregoing conclusion, is observable in the central parts of urinary calculi, though, in- deed, a clot of blood, or bit of thickened mucus, may be conceived to form a nucleus, and afterwards disappear. However this may be, calculi of the bladder are subject to great variety, in regard to their number, size, shape, density, composition, and the manner in which they lie in this organ. .There may be only one, or many. In the last circumstance, they are always of smaller size, and their mag- nitude seems to be less in proportion as they are more numerous. The cases, in which there is only one stone, compared with those in which there are more, are stated to be as three to one.

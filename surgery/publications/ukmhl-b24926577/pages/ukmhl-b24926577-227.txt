HERNIA. 219 tidn, not indicated by external swellings, as when the bowels pass through an aperture in the diaphragm, or are confined by preternatural bands of adhesion. The portion of perito- neum, which is protruded, in ordinary cases, is termed the hernial sac, which, with its con- tents, either passes through some natural open- ing in the parietes of the abdomen, or is forced through a part where no opening naturally exists. The true hernial sac, composed of the peritoneum, receives some adventitious coverings, formed of condensed cellular sub- stance, and of fascia?. In large, old ruptures the great thickness of the sac is found to de- pend chiefly upon that of its outer investments. These external coverings are intimately ad- herent to the true hernial sac, which, there- fore, can never be put back into the cavity of the abdomen again, after once it has been down long enough to acquire its connexion with the surrounding parts. Cases of the sac being reduced, are very rare, and hardly cre- dited. Although the hernial sac usually ap- pears thickened in large old ruptures, it is occasionally found much attenuated, and this, in such a degree, that the convolutions and vermicular motions of the intestines may be distinguished through the skin. Mr. A. Cooper has seen the bowels lie immediately under the

FRACTURES. 4 being drawn upwards over thÂ« inside of the upper fragment by the action of the triceps, rectus, semimembranosus, semitendinosus, and, in short, by all those muscles, which arise from the pelvis, and are inserted, either into the os feinoris, or the bones of the leg, below the fracture. The triceps being attached to both fragments, displaces them, in regard to the di- rection of the limb, by making them project forwards. The weight of the lower part of the member likewise contributes to displace them, with respect to the direction of the limb, while it is also the principal cause of the rotatory de- rangement, in consequence of the point of the foot falling sometimes inwards; but, mostly outwards. The deformity, the shortening of the limb, the crepitus, the mobility of the fragments, the pain, and the impossibility, or difficulty, of moving the thigh, are the symp- toms indicating the nature of the accident, There are two plans of treating fractured thighs; one, by laying the patient on the af- fected side, with his thigh and leg in a bent position; the other, by laying him on his back, with his limb in a straight or extended posture. In the first of these methods, a long splint, having upon it a thick soft pad, and the eighteen-tailed bandage, is to be put under the thigh, which is placed on its outside, upon

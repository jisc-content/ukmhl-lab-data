Neither the direction of the wound, the little thickness of the parietes at the injured part, the injection of a liquid, nor the intro- duction of a probe, nay, not even the spitting up of frothy scarlet blood, nor its discharge from the wound, can form an unquestionable criterion of the wound having penetrated. The only certain test is the alternate entrance and escape of air from the thorax, in such manner as to agitate the flame of a candle, brought near the wound. When the case is so narrow a stab, that the air cannot insinuate itself into the cavity of the chest, provided none of the thoracic viscera are injured, the accident is scarcely more dangerous, than if the weapon had not penetrated quite so deeply. Nor is it necessary to examine, whether the Wound is a penetrating one, or not, since either case requires the same sort of treatment, namely superficial dressings, quietude, and antiphlogistic remedies. When the wound is sufficiently large and direct to let the air pass into the thorax, the edges of the injury may be brought together with sticking-plastei, the part may be covered with a compress, and a bandage applied round the body. 1 lie patient is also to be directed to lie upon the wounded side. This is the only way, by which the air cau be prevented from entering the chest.

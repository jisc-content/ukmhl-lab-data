Sometimes, fractures of the hume- rus remain disunited. This accident has been referred to the broken Surfaces not being in exact contact, to the limb having been too much moved, to old age, and to a general languor in the constitution. The plan, recom- mended for the two first of these instances, is to reduce the fracture anew, and to keep the limb quite motionless. The advanced age of a patient sometimes makes it necessary to con- tinue the employment of the splints, &c. a considerable time, and to have recourse to tonics. When many months have elapsed since the accident, and the motion in the situa- tion of the fracture evinces the formation of a new joint, some advise the ends of the bone to be forcibly rubbed against each other. This painful manoeuvre excites an irritation, which leads to the production of callus. Here the application of splints must be followed up beyond the usual time. When the new joint has been formed too long for this plan to be successful, the only chance of effecting an Union of the bone is by cutting down to the fracture, and sawing off its ends. White.several times practised such an operation with success. o

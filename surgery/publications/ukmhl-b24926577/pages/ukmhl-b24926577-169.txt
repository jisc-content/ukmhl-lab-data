161 FRACTURES. M binding the arm close to the trunk with a roller, and keeping the elbow up to a proper height with a sling or other sort of bandage. 5. When the os humeri is fractured trans- versely about its middle part, below the nser- tion of the deltoid muscle, there is not much displacement, owing to the way in which the fragments are kept steady by the antagonizing action of the triceps and short head of the biceps upon them. The displacement is yet less, when the fracture is situated near the lower end of the bone, where the width of the bone is greater, and the biceps and triceps still antagonize each other. W hen, however, the fracture is oblique, the lower fragment, being drawn upwards by the muscles connected with it, mounts over the upper one. When the solu- tion of continuity is above the insertion of the deltoid, this muscle pulls the lower fragment outwards, and then upwanU, upon the outside of the upper one. W hen the fracture is situated above the attachment of the pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, and teres major, these muscles draw the lower fragment inwards, and then upwards. The shortened state and altered direction of the arm; the inequality felt on tracing the humerus with the lingers; the cre- pitus, pain, and sudden loss of the use of the limb; make the diagnosis sufficiently plain.

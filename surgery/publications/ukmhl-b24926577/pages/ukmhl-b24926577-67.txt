aneurism. 59 Tying the vessel, above and below the sac, recent observations .have proved to be super- fluous. Carotid Aneurism. 1. The possibility of curing this easy, by tying* the artery below the swelling, is well established, by cases, in which Mr. A. Cooper has operated. The probability of success had been evinced, by carotid aneurisms having disappeared, in consequence of a spontaneous obliteration of the adjoining part of the artery. 2. The carotid artery may be got at, and tied, by making an incision on that side of it, which is next the trachea, where no important parts are liable to be injured- The par vagum must be carefully left out of the ligature, which is to be put under the artery with an eye-probe. J Teimus Aneurism. 1. This is a swelling and dilatation of one of the veins at the bend of the arm, excited by a preternatural communication having been formed between such vein and the subjacent brachial artery. The communication is made in the operation of bleeding, when the lancet passes too deeply, so as to transfix the vein, and puncture the artery. The outer wound of the vein heals, but the aperture, by which the

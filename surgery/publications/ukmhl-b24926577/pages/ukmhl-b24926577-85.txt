77 £RONCiICC£LE. 9. Petit, Ileister, and Schmucker, have seen large old bronchoceles spontaneously fall into a state of suppuration, and disappear, without any serious symptoms. These facts have led to the proposal of making the tumor suppurate by artificial means. A seton has been success- fully drawn through the swelling. The plan of irritating the disease with the repeated appli- cation of caustic is apt to bring on a danger- ous inflammation of the tumor and adjacent parts. 10. When a large bronehocele obviously contains fluid, this should be let out by a punc- ture, if the size of the tumor be such as to create urgent symptoms. 11. For the cure of very large bronchoceles, which are attended with great difficulty of breathing and swallowing, and apoplectic symptoms, and which resist every other plan, it certainly seems justifiable to endeavour to lessen the disease by tying one of the large in- ferior thyroideal arteries. A brouchoccle has, indeed, been lessened in this way. It is true, an hemorrhage from the artery prevented a perfect recovery; but, little doubt can be entertained, that if this vessel were firmly' tied with a smallish round ligature, an obliteration of its canal might be safely effected. A\ere we to perform the operatiou, we would not allow

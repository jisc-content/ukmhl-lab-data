trepanning. 329 ascertained, that, in the event of this vein being injured, the hemorrhage from it is not difficult to stop, and knowing that sutures may have the trephine applied to them with perfect security. Whether the great lateral sinuses would bleed so dangerously as to make it un- warrantable to trepan over them, has perhaps not yet been learned. Surgical authors in general advise us not to apply the trephine in the situation of the frontal sinuses; and, cer- tainly, considerable difficulty here presents it- self to the operation. For, if the perforation be carried through the inner table in the same direction as through the outer one, the saw will inevitably injure the dura mater and brain, and the upper part of the circle will be cut through, long before the lower segment is completely divided. Mr. Charles Bell has pro- posed applying first a large trephine to the outer table, and then using a smaller one, which might be placed perpendicularly upon the inner table. It is a prudent maxim never to apply the saw within half an inch of the superciliary ridge of the frontal bone, as such an application cannot be essentially ne- cessary, anfl the orbit might be injured. The groove for the large artery of the dura mater is situated on the inner surface of the anterior in- ferior angle of the parietal bpne, and should

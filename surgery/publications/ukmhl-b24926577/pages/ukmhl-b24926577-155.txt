ERYSIPELAS. 147 kc. The treatment of this case is exactly simi- lar to that of phlegmon. A bilious constitution, hot weather, bad ali- ment, want of exercise, &c. predispose to erysi- pelas. Under such causes the functions of the digestive organs become impaired, and, after some indisposition, fever makes its attack with rigor, to which succeed heat, and an exacerba- tion of the gastric complaints, such as painful tension of the epigastrium, bitterness in the mouth, a tongue covered with yellow mucus, nausea, vomiting of a greenish bitter fluid, &c. The head-ach is insupportable; the pulse is â€œquick and hard; the patient experiences great heat, thirst, a fondness for acids, and aversion to all animal food. In the midst of all these symp- toms, the heat becomes more and more annoy- ing in some particular part of the skin, and here the erysipelas comes out. The eruption most frequently makes its appearance on the face, affecting the subjacent cellular membrane, and extending to the scalp. Coma and delirium now often occur. After some days, the inflam- mation abates, and the cuticle peels off. In bad cases, the erysipelas produces abscesses and extensive gangrenous mischief in the skin, and cellular membrane. 2 L

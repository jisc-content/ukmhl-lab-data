In the luxation upon the obturator foramen, besides the toes and whole limb being turned inwards, a hard round tumor is felt at the upper and inner part of the thigh; the leg is slightly bent; and the limb manifestly elongated, so that the patient, when he endeavours to walk, is obliged to describe with his limb the seg- ment of a circle.

The head of the bone occasions in the groin a tumor, which makes irksome pressure on the crural nerves, which lie on the outer side of the large blood- vessels. The knee inclines a little backwards.

Hence it is, that the limb is turned oufwards. The thigh is lengthened; and a hard tumor is felt at the lower and back part of the buttock. This sort of luxation is seldom*, primitive.

FRACTURES. 165 between the bones, while two assistants, taking hold of the elbow and hand, moderately extend the fore-arm. Some soap-plaster is now to be applied over the injury, and a pad and splint laid along the anterior and posterior surfaces of the fore-arm. The application of a roller, under the splints, seems likely to do harm by pressing the ends of the fracture inwards. It is best to put it over the splints, so as to fix them in their respective places. During the whole of the treatment, the fore-arm is to be supported, from the elbow to the fingers, in a sling. 7- All parts of the thigh-bone arc liable to fractures, notwithstanding the vast thickness of the soft parts, which cover and protect it from external violence. The fractures are mostly produced by a force applied at each end of the bone, and generally happen somewhere about its middle portion. The fragments may be displaced in relation to the diameter of the bone, its length, its direction, and its circum- ference. By the last sort of displacement, is meant a rotation inwards, or outwards, of the lower fragment, while the upper fragment un- dergoes no such movement. The most difficult kind of displacement to prevent, in oblique fractures, is that, which happens in relation to the length of the bone, the lower fragment M 3

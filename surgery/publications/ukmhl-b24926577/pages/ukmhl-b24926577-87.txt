If the heat applied has been of a sufficient degree, the cuticle of the burnt part is soon detached by effusions of serum under it, and, what are called blisters, or vesicles, make their appearance. When the degree of heat is very great, or, when its appli- cation lasts a certain time, it kills the subjacent flesh, decomposes it, and converts it into a black eschar or slough.

M hen the smallest bougie cannot be made to pass through the aperture of the stricture, it has been pro- posed to excite ulceration in the obstruction by making rather forcible pressure for some time, every day, with the point of a bougie. In order to prevent a return of strictures, the em- ployment of the common bougie is not to be left off too soon, nor until one of large size will pass with facility into the bladder. 2. The treatment with common bougies hav- ing been found tedious, and the cure sometimes followed by relapses, surgeons have been led to adopt plans, which have for their object the destruction of the stricture. In the time of Ambrose ParÂ£, bougies, smeared with verdi- greasc, alum, &c. were employed in the treat- ment of strictures. Wiseman used red precipi- tate for the same purpose.

This suggestion subsequently led to a much more convenient method of applying this caustic to strictures, by means of armed bougies; which have a piece of the caustic so fixed in their extremities, that

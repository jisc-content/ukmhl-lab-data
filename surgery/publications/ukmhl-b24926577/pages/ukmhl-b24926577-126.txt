DISLOCATIONS. 118 variety of motion of which they are capable. These accidents are very uncommon in such diarthrosis articulations, as merely allow a slight yielding motion to take place. They are not so unfrequent in the ginglymoid articulations. In the orbicular ones, they occur with a faci- lity, proportioned to the extent and variety of motion, in such joints. For reasons of this kind, the os humeri is luxated nearly as often as all the other bones toy-ether, Dislocations of the elbow and knee are scarcely ever complete, owing to the great extent of the articular surfaces. These luxa- tions may happen forwards, backwards, or to either side. They never can be produced, â€¢without the operation of considerable violence, and a proportionate injury of the soft parts, the inflammation of which is much more to be feared than the dislocation itself. In these instances, the diagnosis is in general very simple, because the quantity of soft parts over the bones is not great. The reduction is also easily effected by pressing the ends of the bones in opposite directions. The thigh and arm are liable to be luxated in any direction; the accident is always complete; and the reduction more or less .difficult. Besides luxations of ginglymoid and orbicu- lar joints, there are other dislocations of a par-

GANGRENE. 201 when the living parts are to be at all irritated, or wounded. 13. An important caution remains to be given, which is, never to perform amputation, in cases of gangrene, before the spreading of the mortification has manifestly stopped, and a line of separation can be discerned, between the dead and living parts. Were this rule neg- lected, the stump would often become gan- grenous soon after the operation, and the pa- tient's death be accelerated. 14. In a few instances, amputation may be deferred longer than the period when the spha- celation of a limb has ceased to spread, and the red line on the living edge denotes the com- mencement of the separation. This happens, when patients are so reduced, that they are likely to die under the operation. The dead parts separate from the living ones down to the bone, which alone connects the putrid mass with the rest of the body. The discharge being moderate, such patients, with the aid of a nourishing diet, bark, cordials, wine, &c. will often soon recover a degree of strength, w hich greatly qualifies them for bearing the am- putation. It no operation were performed, the connexion by the bone would in time be de- stroyed by the process of exfoliation, and the ulcer, perhaps, even heal. But, the produc-

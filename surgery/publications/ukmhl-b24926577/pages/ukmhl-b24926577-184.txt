176 FRACTURES. must be performed immediately, before in- flammatory symptoms and a gangrenous dispo- sition have had time to extend themselves. When great swelling and inflammation have taken possession of the limb, and, particu- larly, when gangrene has commenced, the ope- ration is too late, and the peril must be encountered. Were amputation performed under these circumstances, mortification would seize the stump, and the patient's death be only hastened. Therefore, when the amputation of a compound fracture is put off at first, the surgeon is, as it were, compelled to contend with such dangers as immediately follow. Should the patient escape these, or should he get over the inflammatory stage, the practi- tioner then acquires a second opportunity of amputating, if the circumstances of the case make it necessary, that is to say, if the aspect of the wound, and the profusion of the dis- charge, render it probable, that the patientâ€™s constitution will fall a sacrifice to a perse- verance in the attempt to save the limb. W hen an effort is to be made to preserve the member, the fracture is to be reduced, and the limb laid on a splint, having on it a soft pad, and an eighteen-tailed bandage.

131 DISLOCATION'S. of the thigh-bone pushes against the upper and outer part of the acetabulum, and is driven upwards through the orbicular ligament. The action of the glutei muscles also promotes the ;ascent of it upwards and backwards, while i nearly all the muscles of the thigh become re- laxed by the approximation of their attach- ments. The thigh is shortened, a little bent, and placed in the state of abduction; the whole limb and the toes are turned inwards ; and the Itrochanter major is brought nearer to the an- terior superior spine of the ilium. The limb bannot be lengthened without the reduction oeing accomplished, nor can the toes be turned uitwards, unless the head of the bone be re- Iblaced. If the patient attempts to walk, he jinerely touches the ground with the point of Ins foot. The rotation of the limb inwards, is lowing to the resistance of the orbicular liga- O O \ lent, the thick portion of which, arising from the anterior inferior spine of the ilium, is jifretched in the luxation upwards and out- 1 ards. \ It is otherwise in the dislocation downwards j id inwards. All the muscles, which go from me pelvis to the os femoris, being stretched, | rn the whole limb outwards. The triceps, in 1 striking manner, contributes to this effect.

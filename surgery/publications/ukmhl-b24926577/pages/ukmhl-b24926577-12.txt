4 ABSCESSES. surface of the skin, owing to the tendinous theck which confines it. Therefore, if left alone, it would spread upon the hand and wrist, under the fascia? of those parts, and prove a source of se- rious and extensive mischief. All abscesses un- der fasciae, in any situation whatsoever, should be opened soon; for the matter cannot make its way through tendinous expansions till after a great length of time, during which the patients sufferings would be protracted, and the collec- tion of pus become very large and widely dif- fiised. All abscesses likewise, which .threaten to burst into the chest, or make ulcerated open- ings into the joints, abdomen, &c. cannot be opened too soon after matter is actually formed. Abscesses upon the surface of the brain should also be opened without the least delay, the pres- sure of the matter in that situation being hi ghly dangerous. 2. The best method of discharging the con- tents of abscesses is to puncture the swelling with a lancet. The opening should be made where the skin is thinnest, and, if possible, where the matter can readily flow out by its own gra- vity as fast as it is formed. This gives the ca- vity of the abscess an opportunity of contract- ing, while granulations complete the obliteration of it. 3. A second method of opening abscesses is Iby destroying a piece of the skin with caustic.

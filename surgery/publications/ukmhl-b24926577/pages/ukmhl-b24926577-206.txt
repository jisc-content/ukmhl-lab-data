Air is often formed in parts, which are aflected with mortification ; and, of course, they have an emphysematous feel. Gangrene has sometimes been restricted to incipient, or superficial mortifications, and sphacelus applied to cases, in which the dead parts are considerable, and turned into a black, senseless mass. This distinction, like that of dry and humid gangrenes, is now â€˜ nearly quite rejected, as unpractical and scho- lastic. Though a slough may be scratched, or cut, without pain or harm to the patient, it cannot be pulled away immediately after its formation, without pain, hemorrhage, and an increase of sloughing being produced.

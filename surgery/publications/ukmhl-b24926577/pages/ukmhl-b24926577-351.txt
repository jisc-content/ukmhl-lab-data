VENEREAL ULCERS. 343 z \ one at all taking place.* A secondary sore has this essential difference frQm a chancre, that the matter which it secretes is not infectious. It occurs more readily on mucous membranes, than on the common integuments, and hence, is very frequent on the tonsils and other parts of the throat. Sores of tins description are often of a round shape, though, in certain examples, they eat away the parts, like her- petic or phagedenic ulcers, spreading from one part to another, destroying the skin, and heal- ing on one side, while they are extending themselves on another. Richerand has seen ulcers of this kind thus spread nearly all over the patientâ€™s body, producing one vast cica- trix. The same writer adverts to a particular species of secondary venereal ulcer, which is of a round shape, and begins to heal at its centre, so that, towards the termination of the complaint, the sore represents an ulcerated circle, including a round cicatrix. When this variety of the disease makes progress, the ul- cerated ring becomes larger, while the cica- trix in the centre undergoes a proportional in- crease of size. 7. When, as often happens, doubts are en- tertained, concerning a sore being venereal or not, some authors think the effects of mercury a sure criterion of the nature of the disease.

The stoppage of the bleeding is the next important object. The large open-mouthed femoral artery, being plainly visible, is to be drawn out with a pair of forceps, and firmly tied with a ligature. The other principal bleed- ing arteries are commonly taken up with the tenaculum, in order to be tied. As little flesh as possible should be included in the ligatures. When the end of the bone bleeds more than usual, a compress of lint, held upon it a few minutes, always stops the hemorrhage. 14. The bleeding vessels being secured, and one end of each ligature cut off, the skin and muscles are to be drawn over the end of the stump in such manner, that, when the lips of the wound are brought together, they may form one transverse line, out of which the

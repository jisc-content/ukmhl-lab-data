RETENTION OF URINE. 312 ing causes, as Richerand observes, all occasion mechanical impediments to the passage of the urine outwards from the bladder. Thus the orifice of this receptacle may be closed by the inflammatory swelling of its neck, the pre- sence of a fungous tumor, a varicous state of the blood-vessels, a morbid enlargement of the prostate gland, the pressure of a neigh- bouring swelling, a calculus, or a coagulum. These circumstances may impede the urine from getting into the urethra; but, the ob- stacle may exist in this canal itself. Stric- tures, indeed, are by far the most common causes of a retention of urine. The orifice by which the bladder communicates with the urethra is so small, t])at we cannot wonder at its being sometimes rendered impervious by inflammation. In certain persons, who are robust, plethoric, and affected with hemor- rhoidal complaints, any excess in drinking, venery, or exercise, is enough to induce this form of the disease. Cantharidcs are well known to be capable of making the neck of the bladder inflame. Virulent gonorrhoeas sometimes have the same effect.

WOUNDS. 571 be applied advantageously for diminishing the exposed surface; but, be careful that they make no constriction. In bad cases, it is better, indeed, to dispense with them, until the first dangers of inflammation and sloughing are over. 4. The excessive contusion accompanying gunshot wounds is owing to the rapidity, with which an obtuse body is projected into the injured part. Indeed, the fibres, which the ball touches in its track, are mostly converted into a dark-coloured eschar, which is the effect of the great violence, and not of the heat of tlie ball, as some have erroneously conceived. Gunshot wounds do not bleed, except when very large blood-vessels are injured; they are livid at their circumference; and their inflic- tion is said to be sometimes attended with so forcible a concussion, as paralyzes the part, and even the whole animal economy. Bullets and canon-balls occasionally produce serious mischief, without making any breach in the skin. The muscles and bones may be broken to atoms, without the integuments being wounded. This sort of accident is explicable by the oblique passage of balls over the surface of the body, although it is now and then occa- sioned by a spent cannon-shot. Bad gunshot contusions are frequently followed by gangrene. fi b Â£

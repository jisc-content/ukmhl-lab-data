3 63 WOUNDS. ]. Simple or incised wounds are generally pro- duced by sharp-edged cutting instruments; are seldom attended with loss of substance; and, for the most part, admit of being healed with- out suppuration, or, by what is termed union by the first intention. When a sharp-edged weapon is applied to the surface of the body, with a certain degree of force, it penetrates more or less deeply, and occasions a solution of continuity, which manifests itself by a separa- tion of its edges, depending on the elasticity and contractile properties of the divided parts; by an effusion of blood from the cut vessels; and by pain, arising from the injury of the nerves. The first duty of the surgeon, in the treatment of incised wounds, is to tie such vessels as are large enough to require a ligature. When of considerable size, the mouth of the bleeding artery may be raised with a pair of forceps, for the purpose of having a ligature put round it; in other instances, the tenaculum is the most convenient instrument. Lar«’e ves- sels should always be tied with round firm ligatures, of not too clumsy a thickness, and with sufficient force to produce a division of the inner and middle coats of the vessel. When the cut arteries are not of an important size.

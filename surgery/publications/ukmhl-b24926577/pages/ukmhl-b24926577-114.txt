106 CATARACT. efficacy. An accidental blow on the eye has been known to dissipate a cataract. A drop, or two, of aether applied to the eye, once or twice a day, and frictions over the eye with a weak volatile, or mercurial liniment, have suc- ceeded.â€”(IVare.) 2. There are two different operations prac- tised for the cure of cataracts. The most an- cient is called couching, or the depression of the cataract. That of later invention, is termed extraction. However, neither can prove of any service, in case the retina is insensible. Hence, the satisfaction of observing, that the motion of the iris is free and perfect, and that the patient can disinguish the difference be- tween light and darkness. 3. In couching, or depression, the opaque lens is pushed, with a needle, out of the axis of sight, down into the vitreous humor, where it is ultimately absorbed. In extraction, the opaque body is taken entirely out of the eye, through an incision, made in the lower part of the trans- parent cornea. 4. Mr. Hey uses a round needle, made flat towards the point by grinding two opposite sides, and having a sharp elliptical extremity. Scarpa employs a slender needle, with a slightly curved end, a very sharp point, a flat convexity, and two cutting edges. Some surgeons wrongly prefer straight spear-pointed couching-ncedlcs.

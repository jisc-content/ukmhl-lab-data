1^2 FISTULA LACHRVMALIS. lining, but, chiefly, by a lodgment of mucous matter, two indications present themselves : one is, to check and correct the morbid secre- tion from the inside of the eyelids' the.other, to wash out the lachrymal passages through- out their whole extent. The first object may be accomplished by smearing the inner surface of the eyelids with a little of the ung. hydrarg. nitrat. once or twice a day, and washing the eye with a vitriolic collyrium. The second purpose is accomplished by means of Anel’s syringe, with which warm water is to be injected into the lachrymal sac through the lower punctum lachrymale, a finger being placed on the upper punctum, to keep the fluid from escaping. When this plan, persisted in for some days, does not avail, an attempt may be made to break the obstruction by passing Anel’s little probe through the upper punctum down towards the nose. Sir W. Blizard has advised distending the sac with quicksilver, by means of such a tube and pipe ns are used for injecting the lymphatics, in which method, the force will be in a ratio to the height of the column of tnercury employed. 3. When the obstruction in the nasal due* cannot be thus removed, a small puncture is to be made in the sac, with a very narrow pointed lancet, supposing no opening to exist

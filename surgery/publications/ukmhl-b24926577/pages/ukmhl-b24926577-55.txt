47 ANEURISM'. * slow morbid cause, is not extensive, so that the blood oozes slowly through the interstices of the fibres of the muscular coat, and when the cellular substance surrounding the artery is dense, and sufficient to resist the impetus of the arterial blood, the pulsating tumor remains small and circumscribed, compressible and elas- tic, with very little pain, and without any dis- colouration of the skin covering the swelling. But, in proportion as the rupture or ulceja- iion of the artery increases in size, ami thÂ© surrounding cellular substance yields to the dis- tention made by the blood, the tumor neces- sarily becomes larger, and loses that flexibility and elasticity, which it had at the beginning, while the numerous firm layers of blood, which form in it, at last render the pulsation also obscure. The aneurismal sac, instead of being composed of the 'coats of the artery, are now acknow- ledged to consist of its cellular sheath, and of the adjacent aponeurotic expansions. When aneurisms are very large, they press upon the nerves, veins, and lymphatics around, so as to excite violent pain, torpor, and oedema of the limb. It is not every pulsating tumor that is an aneurism. A swelling situated over any large artery may throb with the vessel; a dis- eased absorbent gland may do so, as well as

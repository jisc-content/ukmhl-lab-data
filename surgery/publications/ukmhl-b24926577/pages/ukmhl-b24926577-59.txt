ANEURISM. &\ tion. When patients do lose their lives from the bleeding, after the mortification of an aneurism, it is because the sloughing has unfor- tunately been confined to a part of the skin and sac, and not extended to the root of the disease. 6. As the obliteration of an artery, affected with aneurism, is the effect of the process called adhesive inflammation, any compression, in order to be effectual, must be such as will make the artery inflame in this manner. The artery itself must also be susceptible of such inflamma- tion; hence, all attempts to cure by compression promise no success, when an aneurism has had as a proximate cause, a steatomatous change of the proper coats of the artery; when it has been preceded by a slow ulceration of these coats; or, when it has originated from ex- cessive relaxation, or from earthy hardness, and brittleness of them. Here the portion of artery adjoining the aneurism is so diseased as not to admit of the proper adhesive inflammation. Not only compression fails, but, also, the liga- ture, when applied in such situation. 7: In-diffused, hard, elevated, painful, aneu- risms, compression is hurtful, because it occa- sions an increase of the swelling of the pressed part; because, while the tumor is compressed ©n one side, it expands on another; and because £ 2 #

102 CATARACT. few exceptions, is either in the crystalline lens, or its capsule. For the most part, it originates slowly, and increases in a very gradual manner. Sometimes, it comes on quite suddenly, and this in a very great degree. The first effect of a beginning opacity is to occasion a mist before the eyes, which surrounds objects, grows more and more dense, and, at length, entirely hides every thing. In proportion as the mist before the eyes increases, the opacity behind the pupil becomes more considerable. In consequence of the lens being thick at its middle, and thin at its edges, the opacity may be first perceived at its centre, and there it is also greatest. The thin margin, which is not quite so destitute of transparency, looks externally like a black circle, behind the edge of the pupil, surround- ing the paler nucleus of the lens. Even when the lens is entirely opaque, a few rays of light still find their wray through its thin edge, and, hence, in cases of the most complete cataracts, patients are always capable of distinguishing light from darkness. Hence, also, the reason, why patients, who have a beginning cataract,, have the most difficulty in seeing things straight before them, and the least in discerning what happens to be situated sideways. As the pupil expands in dark places, and the iris then co- vers less of the thin margin of the lei\s, a

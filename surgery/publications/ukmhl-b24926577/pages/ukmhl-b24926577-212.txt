GONORRHOEA. <204 bent state of the penis, termed chordce, afflict the patient. CAUSES. These are all referrible to an infectious matter being applied to the urethra in the act of co- pulation.- The virus of gonorrhoea was sup- posed, by Hunter, to be identically the same as the poison of -lues venerea, and, therefore, capable, by absorption, of bringing on really syphilitic buboes, sore throats, nodes, &.c. ; or, when inserted into a wound of the skin, capable of exciting a true chancre. Mr. Hunter did not maintain, that such consequences usually- resulted from a gonorrhoea; but, he inculcated the possibility of them, and the prudence of giving mercury in the treatment of the com- plaint. On the other hand, the generality of present practitioners disbelieve the identity of the two poisons, and the power of the go- norrheal virus ever to occasion a chancre, or any syphilitic complaints from absorption. Of course, they look upon the exhibition of mer- cury as useless and improper. B. Bell relates experiments, proving that inoculation with the matter of gonorrhoea cannot excite a chancre, or venereal symptoms. However, Hunter has brought forward facts, fronq which he drew opposite conclusions.

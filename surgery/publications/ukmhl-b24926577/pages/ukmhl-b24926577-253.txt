HERNIA. 245 portion which is attached to the crista of the os pubis. Hence the expression, crural arch, used by Gimbernat. Next to the thin edge of the arch is the external iliac vein; and on the outside of this vessel lies the artery. An absorbent gland is sometimes found between the vein and the tendon. The protrusion of the viscera under Poupart's ligament is pre- vented by certain fascia?, which shut up the space below it every where except a small point, which is left between the iliac veins, and the thin border of the above ligament. This point is only closed by a cellular substance, together with, occasionally, a lymphatic gland. It is the place where the bowels are liable to be protruded, and has been called by Gimbernat the crural, by Hey, the femoral ring. The prolapsed parts lie between the thin border of the crural arch, and the ex- ternal iliac vein. They first descend from the abdomen nearly in a perpendicular direction, and come into the hollow of rhe pectineus. The resistance which the viscera meet to their further passage downwards, makes them pro- ject forwards, so as in general to lie in front of Poupart's ligament, the body of the sac forming a right angle with the neck. The hernia is situated on the outside of the fascia of the thigh, excepting unusual instances, in u 3

134 DISLOCATIONS. portionatg to the number and power of the muscles attached to the bone. The surgeon, standing on the outside of the limb, is to effect the coaptation by making pressure upon the great trochanter, or upon the prominent head of the bone, so as to direct the latter towards the acetabulum, and make it slip into this ca- vity, as soon as the extending power has brought it sufficiently near. When the head of the bone slips into such cavity, a particular noise is immediately heard, the pain is dimi- nished, and the limb regains its natural length and power of motion. A recurrence of the dislocation is to be pre- vented by keeping the knees together with a roller. A piece of the emplastrum saponis and a roller are also usually applied to the hip, though evidently only for the sake of appear- ances. Were the soft parts much swollen, cold washes and leeches would be better. The pa- tient is to be kept in bed for eight or ten days, and should take one or two purgative doses. When a luxation of the thigh is left unre- duced, an annihilation of the acetabulum, the formation of a new joint, or else anchylosis, and a wasting and weakness, of the limb, are the consequences. 6.

307 PILES. x 2 creScence: R Gallarum pulv. 3ij. Camph. 3fs. Adipis suilla; praepar. 3j- Misce. The bowels are, at the same time, to be kept well open with mild laxatives, electuaries containing cream of tartar, sulphur, &c; 8. When the patient is often seriously afflict- ed with these painful attacks; or when the tumors are so large, or numerous, as to create almost continual annoyance, preventing active exercise, and even rendering the expulsion of the feces more or less difficult; it is the duty of the surgeon to advise the extirpation of the disease. 9- In general, the most eligible mode of removing piles is with a knife. The appre- hension of hemorrhage after the operation is, for the most part, unfounded. When the tumors are on the outside of the sphincter, the bleeding need excite no alarm, as it cannot well be considerable, and were it ever so profuse, its situation is such as to be quite under the control of surgery. Some piles are only pro- truded at the anus when the patient strains; and, of course, when it is wished to remove them, he must be requested to take this method of making them descend, while he sits over a bidet filled with warm water. When the swell- ings are down, the surgeon is to take hold of them with a tenaculum, and cut them away.

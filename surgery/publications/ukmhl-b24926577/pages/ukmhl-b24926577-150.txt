142 EMPHYSEMA. SYMPTOMS. w hen the lungs are wounded, the air, which escapes from the breach, cannot always find a ready exit from the chest. When the breach is occasioned by the point of a broken rib, the air must obviously have no passage, and, in proportion as it escapes from the lung, must either accumulate in the chest, or be diffused in the texture of the body. When there is a large external wound, conjoined with that of the lungs, the air finds its way outwards. But, when the outer wound is narrow, or does not exist at all, as in cases of broken ribs, the air, effused in the chest, is forced, when the thorax contracts in expiration, through the breach in the pleura costalis, and thence diffuses itself through the communicating interstices of the cellular membrane nearly over the whole body. The cellular substance is every where blown up to an enormous thickness, and the air at length distending the cellular texture of the viscera, the case hardly admits of a cure. In proportion as the air finds difficulty in getting out of the chest, either through the smallness of the wound, or from the cellular substance being already much distended, it collects in the O â€¢/

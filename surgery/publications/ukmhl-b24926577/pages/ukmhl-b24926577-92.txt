CANCER. SYMPTOMS. Cancer presents itself in two forms, viz. in that of a tumor, or induration, and in that of a very malignant destructive ulcer. It is termed occult, while it appears as a mere hardness, or swelling; open, when it has assumed the ulcer- ated state. W hen a malignant scirrhus, or a warty excres- -j cence, has proceeded to a state of ulceration, occasionally, shooting pains, is irregular in its figure, and presents an unequal surface; if it discharges a sordid, sanious, or fetid matter; verted, at other times retorted, and exhibit a serrated appearance; and should the ulcer, in its progress, be frequently attended with hemor- rhage ; the case is generally regarded as a can- to almost every sort of glandular induration, whether malignant, or not. The true scirrhus, bv which is meant that, which is of a cancerous nature, before it falls into the ulcerated state, is hard and unequal on its surface, a little tender to the touch, not disposed to suppurate, and i if the edges of the sore be thick, indurated, and often exquisitely painful, sometimes in- attended with a constant sense of ardent, and, cerous ulcer.â€”(Pearson.) The term scirrhus has been vaguely applied

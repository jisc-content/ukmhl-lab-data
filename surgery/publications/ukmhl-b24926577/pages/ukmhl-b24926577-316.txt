PILES. 30$ The bleeding is more likely to be profuse after the excision of these internal piles. The injec- tion of a cold solution of alum into the rectum, however, will rarely fail to stop the hemor- rhage: if it should be insufficient, distending the rectum with sponge will be found effectual. 10. The plan of extirpating piles with a ligature came into practice from a fear of the hemorrhage, which might follow the use of a cutting instrument. But, since experience has proved such apprehension to be generally groundless, tying hemorrhoids is, perhaps, only to be preferred, when the tumors are not merely large, but obviously distended with a good deal of blood. When they have a firm fleshy feel, the bleeding need never be feared, how large soever they may be. Nor is there any reason for dreading it, when the piles are externally situated, even though they may be plainly seen to be turgid with blood. It is then to internal piles, which, on being pro- truded, appear to be highly distended with blood, that the ligature seems applicable. Ty- ing piles is much more painful than cutting them away, and has occasionally brought on symptoms of so alarming a kind as to render the immediate removal of the ligature indis- pensable.

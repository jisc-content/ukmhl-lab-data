ANEURISM. 56 nal iliac artery might he cut down to, and tied, so as to cure an aneurism reaching to the groin: no idea was entertained, that the anastomoses were yet adequate to the supply of the whole lower extremity. The contrary facts have now, however, been put out of all doubt, by several operations performed by Abernethy, Freer, and Tomlinson. 2. The necessary operation is exceedingly simple. An incision, about three inches in length, is to be made through the integuments. It is to begin a little above Poupart’s ligament, extend upward in the direction of the artery, and be somewhat more than half an inch on the outside of the upper part of the abdominal l ing, so as to keep out of the way of the epi- gastric artery. The aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle is next to be divided in the direc- tion of the outer wound. The lower part of the internal oblique muscle is now exposed; and the finger being put under its lower edge and that of the transversalis, these parts are to be divided with a crooked bistoury. The finger may nowr be passed up\vrards, under the peri- toneum, by the side of the psoas muscle, so as to touch the artery, about two inches above Poupart’s ligament. 3. By means of an eye-probe, either a single or a double ligature is to be conveyed under

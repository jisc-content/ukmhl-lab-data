385 WOUNDS. the parietes of this cavity, and are of a certain size, allow the air to enter the bag of the wounded pleura, by which means, the lung oil the injured side suffers compression, collapses, and is rendered for a time useless in respect to respiration. When both sides of the chest have had an opening made into them at once, the patient must die suffocated, in consequence of the air rushing into the cavity of each pleura, and the right and left lungs falling into a col- lapsed state. If the thorax were to expand, the air, which has a tendency to enter the glottis, could not now descend into the com- pressed lungs, there being an equilibrium between that which presses on their external surface, and that which ought to pass down the trachea. When, in experiments upon living animals, an opening is made only into one side of the chest, the animal breathes by the lung of the opposite side, its respiration is hurried, because one lung has to execute the whole function; and the air enters and escapes from the wound wi'th a hissing noise, and with force enough to blow out a lighted taper. If another opening be made into the opposite side of the thorax; suffocation is produced. Similar phe- nomena happen with* regard to the human sub- ject. The signs of a wound having penetrated the cavity of the chest are exceedingly falla- c c

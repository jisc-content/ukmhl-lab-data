1*4 DISLOCATIONS. made by the slipping of the head of the hone into the glenoid cavity, and by the power which the patient now has of carrying his hand to his forehead. When the dislocation has existed several days, the diagnosis is more obscure, and the re- duction more difficult. After a month, the swelling of the parts about the joint, the con- traction of the opening in the capsular liga- ment, and the habituated state of parts to their altered position, render the case almost irre- ducible. Desault however, bv means of great force, used to reduce shoulders, which had been, luxated three or four months. When a luxation of the humerus downwards remains unreduced, it is soon changed into one forwards, or inwards, the head of the bone ascending to just under the coracoid process. Beneath the clavicle, in front of the shoulder, a hard, round tumor is then felt, occasioned by the head of the bone, under the pectoral muscle. Here the head of the bone lodges, * and, by compressing the scapula, at last forms, for itself an articular cavity. This new joint allows of a good deal of motion; but, the arin can never be carried round; and it has a short- ened, emaciated appearance. The luxation of the humerus inwards, or forwards, is not always consecutive* It may

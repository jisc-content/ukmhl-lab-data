DISEASES OF WOMEN. 383 admitting the little finger. The nymphse were removed, and a cure followed. Thomas arranges the disease of the hymen as follows : i. Fibroid or cartilaginous degeneration. 2. Ossification. 3. Aphthous ulce- ration. 4. Inflammatory ulceration. 5. Irritability, accompanied by spasm. 6. An imperforate condition. These heads are seve- rally considered and illustrated by cases. In Paget^s case death from acute peritonitis took place five days after the operation for imperforate hymen. The contained fluid of the uterus and Fallopian tubes (the latter enormously distended) had escaped into the peritoneal cavity. Henson relates a case of retention from imperforate hymen, of the ordinary kind. Anselmiee caUs attention to the fact that the use of the actual cautery as above may produce a very serious amount of narrowing of the vagina. In one case incisions of the vagina were neces- sary, in order that delivery might be effected, and in others very serious inconvenience resulted. RiGBY relates a case of pruritus pudendi cured by removal of con- stipation and gastro-biliary derangement; and subsequently, another, in which the pruritus was removed by assiduous constitutional treat- ment. Paupert calls attention to the benefit resulting from the appHcation of glycerine in cases of hypersesthesia of the vulva, with ecthymatous eruptions, and also in cases of pruritus of the same parts. L. de la Chaeriere reports five cases of cysts situated in or beneath the walls of the vagina. V. diseases of the breast. Hess.—Extirpation d. beider Bruste. [Removal of both Breasts.] AUg. Wien.

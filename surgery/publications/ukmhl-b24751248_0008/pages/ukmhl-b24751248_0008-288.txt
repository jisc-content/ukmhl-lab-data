REPORT ON STJRGliUY. 274 during the Indian Mutiny, as contrasted with the experience of the Crimean campaign, is interesting. Appia's is a short practical treatise. According to him delride- meni is no longer practised in gunshot wounds by Trench military surgeons, except for a specific object, as the removal of the ball, kc. Instead of it he recommends long cuts througli skin and fascia when there is nmcli inflammatory swelling; the muscles bulge tlirough tlie cuts, but tins is of no moment. If the bullet can be extractefl without a grave operation, this should always be done; but if not, it should be left. It was the "Ercncli practice in the Crimea to remove all splinters of bone immediately, and Baudens insists upon it - but Stromeyer waits till large splinters have become loose as by so doing the periosteum is spared, and he also shows that mmshot fractures often heal with very sHght exfoliation. _ The fk-st di-essing should be simple-a handful of charpie soaked in cold water. Continual irrigation is especiaUy iiseful m modera- tins the fii-st inflammatory swelling. In secondary haemorrhage, requiring dehgation, the artery should be tied above the wound. During the Eevolution m Pans 1848, and in the Crimea, primary amputations were more successful than secondary. In 1848, fractures of the femur were barely cvirable and in aU comnWed fractm-es in the lower two tlnrds mme ha e amputation shoidd be performed; but this rule does not apply to those in the upper third, because amputation near the lup, or d^- Sation, is so generaUy fatal, that it is betier to try to save he mnb.

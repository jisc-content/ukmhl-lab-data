It is recoiuniendecl that the injection be made by a very small cauula; tliat the injection be at first of very slight strength, gradually to be increased, the object being to excite a slow process of inflammation only in the cyst.

In Alux's case, spina bifida, affecting nearly the whole canal, but during life apparently limited to the lumbar region, was associated with hydrocephalus. In Messer's case the spina bifida was asso- ciated with umbilical hernia and two peculiar supra-scapular bodies. In two cases related respectively by Sheareii and Sedgwick, the anterior abdominal wall was deficient. Widerhofer relates the case of an infant M'ho lived only two days. On examination, the left side of the thorax was almost filled by intestines, an opening existing in the diapliragm.

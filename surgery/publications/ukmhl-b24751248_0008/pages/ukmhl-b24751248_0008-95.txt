81 SECRETION. ■ It must be left to future research to clear up the discrepancies of these different experiments. CzERMACK found that the application of electricity to the cervical sympathetic, under certain conditions, first increases, then arrests, the flow of saliva from the submaxillary gland. Eckaed found that I the secretion differs in appearance and in chemical properties according as the sympathetic or the Hngual nerve is stimulated. LuDwiG and Spiess found that the temperatui-e of the saliva II secreted by the submaxillary gland, when galvanism is applied to S its nerves, is gi-eater than that of the blood from which it is secreted. The difference of temperature being i-8 degree. This fact proves that the process of secretion, like many of the other animal functions, is attended with a notable increase of heat. On analysing the milk from the hypertrophied breast of a woman, set. 26, ScHLOssBERGER found it of a specific gravity of 0-98—0-99, whereas that of normal milk is i-03-1-046. The milk contained in 100 parts— Water Solids Noimal milk (Becquerel and Vernois). 67-52 . . 89 — 87 32-48 . . II _ 13 I00"00 28-54 . . 0-6 — s-66 Fat .

(Schmidt, vol 102 No. 7, p. 5.) • ^' MoNiER found that the casein and albumen in acidulated milk possess the power of removing the colour of cameleon; and upon thjs he has founded a method of estimating the quantity of these substances Sugar-of-milk and butter have no effect upon the colour The albumen, for example, he calculates by taking 10 c c )f milk at a temperature of 45-50° C, adding to it a drop of acetic icid which separates the casein and butter, filtering, and then add- ng his standard solution of camelcon. The author, in his second 'aper, gives a method for calculating volumetrically the quantity )t starch m any solution. ^ ^

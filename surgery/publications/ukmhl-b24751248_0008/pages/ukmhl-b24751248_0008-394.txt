REPORT ON MlUWirERY, VA'C. 880 and the uterus. The neck of the uterus is thereby pushed upwards and forwards. The first symptom is pain, and there is great pale- ness of the skin, which symptoms occurring in a young woman at the menstrual period, the usual discharge being absent or less than usual, indicate that uterine haimatocele is present. In the treat- ment of menorrhagia, which is believed to be often followed by hsematocele of this character, the author recommends quinine in large doses. VoisiN has collected forty-two cases of retro-uterine hsema- tocele, ten of these observed by himself. The hsemorrliage is, he believes, always intra-peritoneal. The most favorable time for its occurrence is at the time of menstruation, especially in conjunction with traumatic influences, such as blows, falls, &c. The diagnostic points are—the commencement of the disease at the time of men- struation, the profuseness of the flow, the sudden occurrence of attacks like those of peritonitis, the sudden formation of the retro- uterine tumour, the quickly following anaemia, &c.

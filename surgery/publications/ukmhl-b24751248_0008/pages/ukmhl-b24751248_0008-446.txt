IIKPORT ON LEGAL .MliDlCINK, KTC. III. POISONS AND POISONING. A. Diseases simulating Poisoning. On Apparent Poisoning. (Friedreicb, 9, 2.) In this article, it is assumed that symptoms simuhitiiig extraneous poisoning may be produced by spontaneous generation of organic poison in the human body during life, by indiosyncrasy, and by natural diseases having symptoms analogous to those produced by poisons. B. Alleged Poisoning, with poison not identified. (Piiarm., Dec, 341.) At the Central Criminal Court, on October 27 th, 1859, G. F. Eogers was indicted for the wilful murder of Z. Wright, a female, with whom he had cohabited, and who died about a M eek after her confinement. The scientific evidence of Letheby went to show the absence of mineral poison; but from a quantity of treacle- like fluid he obtained about a drop of an oily body, Avhich was very acrid, and on application to his lip produced blisters : some of the same description of oily matter was found in the vomit and in the contents of the stomach. The oily matter was not from cantha- rides, as he had once supposed. A guinea pig was killed by some of it, and the same substance was again extracted from the guinea pig, and then killed several sparrows. Letheby, together with Baker and Garrod, were of opinion that death in this case did not arise from any natural disease, but from the adminis- tration of some foreign irritant. Tor the defence it was urged, that as the real nature of the acrid matter discovered in the stomach could not be determined by chemical experiment, it might have been generated by disease. The jury returned a verdict of Not guilt]/. (See remarks upon this casein a leader of 'Medical Times,' November 5th, p. 460.) c. Disproved allegations of Poisoning. On Poisoning by Cigars.

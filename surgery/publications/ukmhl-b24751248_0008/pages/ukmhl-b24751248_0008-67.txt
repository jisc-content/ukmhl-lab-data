ON THE ORGANS OF SENSE. 53 eye of two lights, in neitlier of wliicli, separately, i^rismatic green exists. 2dly. That the joint action of two lights, separately pro- ducing the most lively sensations of blue and yellow, does not give rise to that of green, even when one of them contaiyis in its compo- sition the totality of green light in the spectrum. And 3dly. That all our liveliest sensations of yellow are produced by the joint action of the rays, of which those separately exciting the ideas of red and green form a large majority; and that a decided yellow impression is produced by the union of these only. He further adds, that from these premises it would seem the easiest possible step to con- clude the non-existence of yeUow as a primary colour. But this conclusion he is unable to admit in the face of the facts—1st, that a yellow ray, incapable of prismatic analysis into green and red, may be shown to exist, both in the spectrum and in flames in which soda IS present; and adly, that neither red nor green, as sensations, are m the remotest degree suggested by this yeUow in its action on the eye. Whether under these circumstances the vision of normal- eyed persons should be termed trichromic or tetrachromic, seems an open question. That Mr. Pole^s vision is diclu-omic, there can be no doubt. Wright thinks that the essential cause of shortsightedness is to be sought for m the iris, wliich in aU cases is preternatui-ally con- tracted. Dilatation of the pupil by beUadonna extends the field of vision, while contraction by opium shortens it.

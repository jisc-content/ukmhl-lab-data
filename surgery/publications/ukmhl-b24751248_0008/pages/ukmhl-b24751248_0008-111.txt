Bird thought that it was a product of the scrofu- j lous diathesis, and some others look upon it as hereditary. It I frequently occurs in the urine of chlorotic women. The best plan j of treatment is to correct any disorder of the assimilative functions, ' and attend to the general health. , Haughton derives from experiment the following table, showing I the relation between the specific gravity of healthy urine, and the amount of urea contained in it: Specific gravity. lOIO'O 1010- s lOI i-o 1011- 5 10I2'0 1012- 5 1013- 0 1014- 0 1014- 5 10150 1015- 5 10160 1016- 5 1017- 0 1017- 5 1018- 0 10185 1019- 0 1819-5 Grains urea per ounce of lu'ine. 5- 0 57 6- 6 7- 2 7- 8 8- 4 88 9- 2 9-6 lO'O 10-4 10- 9 11- 2 11-9 Specific gravity. 1020-0 1020- 5 1021- 0 1021- 5 1022- 0 1022- 5 1023- 0 1023- 5 1024- 0 1024- 5 1025- 0 io2S'5 1026- 0 1026- 5 1027- 0 1027- 5 1028- 0 1028- 5 1029- 0 1029-5 Grains urea_per ounce of unne. 12-2 12-4 12-6 12- 9 13- 1 13-3 13-4 13-5 137 13-8 13- 9 i3"9S 14- 0 140 14-0 140 14-0 13-95 13-9 : _ Selleu estimates the acidityof the urine by observing how much ■ IS reqmred to neutralize a solution of caustic soda of given stvenjh He uses a capUary syphon, which delivers the fluid, drop by dSn' into a measured quantity of urine.

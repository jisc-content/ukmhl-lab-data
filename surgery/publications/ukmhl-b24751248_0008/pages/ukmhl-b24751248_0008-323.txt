WOUNDS, AND DISEASES OP THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 309 Ward's patient, a coal-wliipper, aet. 51, had noticed the swelling the ham for one month before his admission. Pressure was ap- plied alternately with a meat-fl-eight and Bigg's instrument. Not- withstanding great care, on the fourth day, the skin over the arter^^, at the lower quarter of Scarpa's triangle, begun to slough; and M-hen the eschar fell away, an inch and a-half of the artery could be felt at the bottom of the wound covered by sloughy connective tissue. Granulation commenced, and on the fourteenth day after separation of the slough, the artery was tied in two places—above and below the wound; the distance between the two ligatui-es was two inches and a-half. Good recovery. The ' British and Foreign Medico-Chirurgical Eeview' contains a case of popliteal aneurism—a quarryman, set. 24. The aneurism increased rapidly, inflamed, and suppuration impended. The femoral artery was tied, with immediate relief—locally and con- stitutionally. Thirty-one days afterwards, when he left the hospital, the tumom- had disappeared, except at the upper and inner part of the ham, where it was about as large as an egg. Some months afterwards, it enlarged again, and burst into the knee joint, when amputation was performed. Death followed on the fifth day. In Bulteel's case the femoral artery was wounded near its termination with a gouge. Profuse hsemorrhage took place, and life was nearly extinct. Deligation of the vessel in Scarpa's tri- angle, four inches above the wound was preferred to searching for, and tying the vessel at the wound. No secondary htemorrhage! Recovery. Hawkins' case is a macliinery accident, followed immediately by great ecchymosis and swelling of the ham, with great pain. Pour- teen days afterwards, gangrene of the leg having occurred, amputa- tion through the lower third of the tliigh was performed. The artery and vein were both found torn across, and the ends were about one inch and a half apart.

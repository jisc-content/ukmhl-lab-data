25 VASCULAR SYSTEM. at 12^ it was complete. One of the limbs was now moved back- Tv-ards and forwards till it became flaccid. In from two to five minutes the rigor mortis returned. The same experiment, with a similar result, was performed at i o'clock. At 3 o'clock the result was less satisfactory. In twenty hours the rigor mortis did not re- appear after being removed by forcible means. Kuhne examined the expressed juice of muscles in order to ascertain the cause of rigor mortis. The fresh juice coagulated in fifteen minutes, and, after a time, had an acid reaction, hke muscles when they are in a state of rigor mortis, or beginning to putrefy. KtJSSMAUL found that the injection of a few drops of cliloroform into an artery caused permanent rigor in the muscles supplied by it. He thinks it acts by causing coagulation of the muscular fibrin. A muscle in this condition of rigor is more easily torn across than a healthy one. The injection of healthy blood does not restore the muscular irritability after chloroform. Ether and other stimulants act in a somewhat similar manner. VASCULAR SYSTEM. Waters,—On the Intimate Structure and the Distribution of the Blood-vessels of the Human Lung, (Proc.

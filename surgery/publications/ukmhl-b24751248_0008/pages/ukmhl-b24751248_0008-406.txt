REPORT ON MIDWIFERY, ETC. 392 1857, tlie state of the weather had a cousiderable influence. A much larger proportion of the women delivered in cold and wet days were affected than others. ScuuLTEN records the microscopic appearances of the blood of several M'omen suffering from puerperal diseases. The chief of the changes observed Avas a fatty condition of the white corpuscles, but this was not present in all cases. ViRCHOW states, that Irom the autumn of 1856 to the spring of 1858, eighty-three fatal cases of puerperal disease occurred in the Charite of Berlin. The disease was most fatal in the winter months, a fact attributed by the author to sparing ventdation. Then follows an account of the chief post-mortem appearances obsei-ved. Martin believes that there is a form of puerperal fever depen- dent on a propagation of the endometritis into the Tallopian tubes, and an effusion of the pm-ulent products of this inflammation into the peritoneal cavity. It is important not to use too much palpa- tion, or the contents of the tubes may be pressed into the cavity. DISEASES OF CHILDREN. GENERAL TREATISES, HYGIENE, STATISTICS, ETC.

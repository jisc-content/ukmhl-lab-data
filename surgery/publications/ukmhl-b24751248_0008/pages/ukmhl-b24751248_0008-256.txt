Wallmann describes submucous gastritis as a purulent, diffuse infiltration, sometimes forming abscesses with cribriform openings in the superjacent mucous membrane. It extends to the perito- neum, or even to the iileiu-fe and pericardium. It is mostly observed as a secondary phenomenon in pyaemia, grave puerperal fevers, malignant variola, &c. Its occurrence is also favoured by certam epidemic influences. Its immediate cause is probably the formation of emboli in the vessels. BoKAi divides retro-pharyngeal abscesses intoâ€”(i) idiopathic; (2) such as result from suppuration of lymphatic glands; (3) those connected witli disease of the cervical vertebra?. The symptoms are, difficulty in swaUowing, stiffness of the neck, nasal voice, reversion of the head. Abscesses connected with bone run a slower course than the others. The prognosis is favorable usually in the first class if the pus is evacuated early.

It does not appear that the distension was occasioned by tlie contracting cicatrices of ulcers. Clemens records the foUowing curious case.

Although they do increase the amount of inorganic matter removed through the urine, yet, as it is the organic matter which is generally considered as contaminatmg the blood in disease, it is evident they exert no effect whatever in depurating this fluid, bu{, on the contrary, are positively injurious. Colcliicum, on the other hand, acts in a materially different manner, eliminating an increased quantity of organic and inorganic matter. Dickinson maintains that "there are two essentially distinct conditions of kidney giving rise to what is called Bright's dis- ease, and these may be distinguished from each other by the presence or absence of external granulations." In one, the non- granular, the disease is essentially tubular, and is marked by altera- tions of the epithelium. In the other, the granular, the chsease is inter-tubular, and is marked by thickening and adhesion of tlie capsule, and the extension of fibrous processes from it into tlie kidney; it has two periods, one of enlargement, that wliich is com- monly seen; one of diminution, which is rare. Of 357 cases, 250 were granular, 107 smooth. Of the latter, the average age was twenty-eight years; of the former, fifty; "proving that the one disease is not a sequel or stage of the other." In 17 cases of granular disease the gouty or rheumatic diathesis existed; in i only of the smooth variety was there any trace of such having been present. Gaunieb, from his own experience, as well as that recorded by others, is led to recommend the administration of tannin, in doses of half a drachm to a drachm, daily, in cases of anasarca developnl

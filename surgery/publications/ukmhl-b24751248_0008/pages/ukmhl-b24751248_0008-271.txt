"Its curative action is manifested by abundant urine, gradually resuming its physiological characters, by perspiration, early alvine evacuations, return of appe- tite, &c."

Scott records the results of experiments made on dogs whose gall-bladder was made to open externally by a fistulous orifice after the common duct had been tied. After the normal amount of bile secreted in twenty-four hours had been determined for two days, a large dose of calomel was given, and then the average amount' of bile secreted diu-ing the two succeeding days was ascertained. The result in all the foiu- experiments was the same, viz., that tliere was a diminution in the amount of fluid bile and bile-solids secreted after the administration of large doses of calomel.

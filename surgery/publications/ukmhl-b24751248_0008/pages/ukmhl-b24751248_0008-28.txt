Owen says, the question of tlie vertebral characters of the Ptero- dactyles is specially interesting with reference to the carrying out the comparison of their skeleton with that of birds. From liis investigations of the species of Fterosauria, extending from the period of the Lias, as exemplified by the Bimorpliodon macronyx, to the Upper Green-sand, as exemplified by the Fterodactylus SedgwicMi, and Pier. Fittoni. The author has ascertained the fact that, with respect to the cervical and dorso-lumbar vertebrae, the terminal articular surfaces of the vertebral bodies are simply concave ante- riorly and convex posteriorly ; and that they consequently manifest the earliest known instance of the "procoeUan" type wliich now prevails in the reptilian class. But in no other reptile, he says, are those articular surfaces so narrow vertically, in proportion to their breadth, as they are in the cervical vertebrae of the Fterosauria. In

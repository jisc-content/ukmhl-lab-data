DISEASES OF WOMEN. 371 air-pessary to reduce the tumour failed. Finally, an air-pessary was introduced into tlie os itself and kept in situ by an external apparatus, and inflation performed. Eeduction was then effected in forty-eight hours. BissiLL details particulars of three cases of recent inversion of the uterus, which occurred, certainly in two out of the three, inde- pendently of traction on the cord. In two cases reduction was effected, but not in the third. Quackenbush refers to a case in which reduction was effected by White, of Buffalo, after fifteen years' duration; and to a more recent one of his own, also reduced. McCLrNTOCK relates the case of a woman with inversion of the uterus of fourteen months' standing. The inversion was not complete. Several attempts to reduce the tumour failed; the operation of removal by the ecraseur was practised, and the patient recovered. II.

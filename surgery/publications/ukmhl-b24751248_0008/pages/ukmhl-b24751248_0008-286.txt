Beunaud considers fever always as a pure nervous phenomenon, since the organic conditions of it can be produced by acting on the nervous system alone. Tlie cause of it may be an internal, as a poison absorbed into the veins, or an external, as an influence o])e- rating on the skin and through sensory nerves on the nervous cen- tres. In all cases the efPect is produced of paralysis of the sympa- thetic. The facts to which Bernard appeals are chiefly the well- known results of division of the sympathetic, as well as that of galvanic irritation of sensory nerves, which at first produce lowering, and subsequently, by exhaustion, elevation of the temperature. HOPPE relates the results of numerous experiments on frogs, made for the purpose of determining the action of tartar emetic on con- tractile tissues and on the nervous substance. The heart was at first excited to increased pulsation, and afterwards enfeebled. On the vessels it seemed generally to have a contracting power. The nerves, brain, and spinal cord were enfeebled, and semi-paralysed by its action. Mantegazza, in an elaborate treatise on coca, describesâ€”(i) tlie plant, its mode of culture, and the preparation of the leaves; (2) the mode in which it is used; (3) its physiological action, and its hygienic application; (4) its therapeutic action and employment; and (5) gives illustrations of its use in practice. Biucii, in a paper on oxygen as a therapeutic agent, states, " that abundant evidence can be brought forward to prove, beyond moral doubt, that in certain lowered conditions of the vital forces, tliis gas cannot unfrequently exercise an alterative and tonic ijiflueiic- upon the entire animal economy which no other medicinal agent a present known can exert."

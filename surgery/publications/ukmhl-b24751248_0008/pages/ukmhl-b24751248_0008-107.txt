Starch diet first increases the secretion, then diminishes it, and at length causes atrophy of the gland, as happens in starved animals. Priedleben found that extirpation of the gland is not fatal to young dogs; and that when both the thymus and spleen are extirpated the preparation of the blood and the nourishment of the body are defective; so much so that after a time all the animals operated on die of a species of inanition. When the thymus alone is removed the spleen increases in size. The urine is also found to be diminished in quantity. ScHEUER detected guanin in the pancreas of the ox. He says that there can be no doubt of the substance found in the pancreas being the same as that obtained from guano, —i. From the elementai-y analysis. %. The characteristic combination with hydro- chloric acid. 3. The insolubibty in pure water. And lastly, the reaction with nitric acid and potash. Strecker found in the juice of flesh a substance which he named sarUn {Q^^^f)^ ; but which is iji reahty the same as Scherer found and previously described under the name of hypoxanthin. The test for it is,—when heated on a spatula with weak nitric acid, it forms a yellow substance, wliich, on the addition of potash, gives a reddish-yellow solution. This solution on being evaporated to'drynes's leaves a fine dark purple-red matter. Scherer and Strecker are now both of the opimon that hypoxanthin and xanthic oxide are identical The latter substance Scherer found in normal urine, liver spleen pancreas, brain, and muscle; and in the blood in disease Strecker' m his last communication, says that guanin can be transformed into xanthic oxide through the agency of nitric acid.

450 REPORT ON LEGAL MEDICINE, ETC. 27. Zinc. Case of Poisoning by Burnell's Solution (Chloride of Zinc). (Guy's, 128.) Ogle.—Poisoning by Sulphate of Zinc. (Lancet, 2, 210.) SantesSOn,—Poisoning by Impure Sulphate of Zinc. (Schmidt, 102, 19.) The first ease proved fatal after the expiration of fourteen weeks. Vomiting had occurred ten minutes after taking the dose of poison (in mistake for gin), and had continued during the -whole time, not- withstanding suitable treatment. In the stomach, which was very much contracted, were discovered two perforating ulcers. The case of Ogle, under the title of "Death from slow poi- soning," refers to a man who was found dead, with Avounds in his throat, which, howevei', did not account for death. The stomach looked like tripe, and on analysis was found to contain sulphate of zinc. The man had used this salt as a wash for his eyes, and had during several years made frequent attempts at suicide. Santesson's case is that of a poor, reduced woman, who got a large dose of impure sulphate of zinc instead of Epsom salts. She died after much torture. The case is very compUcated, and teaches little. The impurities of the zinc were not further inquired into, and seem to have had no share in the result. A2)penclix. Por medico-legal analyses the following statement of Pettenkofetj, concerning the solubility in chloroform of the following alkaloids, is of great interest: too parts of cliloroform dissolve 0*57 of mor- phia, 31-17 of narcotia, 4-31 of cinchona, 37-47 of quina, 20-19 of stryclinia, 56-70 of brucia, 51-19 of atropia, 58-49 of veratria. IV. SUICIDE.

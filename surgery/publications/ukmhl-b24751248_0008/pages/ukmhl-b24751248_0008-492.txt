And despite the elaborate character of Guerdan's argument, the prejudice finds ample justification in the entirely speculative and hypothetical character of all that he advances relating to these great causes of disease. Hennigson relates some cases from his own experience, which go to prove, that when healthy persons are for a short time in one and the same room with patients suffering from cholera, this disease may be transferred to them, although they may live in a place where cholera is not epidemic. Keugelstein believes that phthisis is propagated by the bedding of persons who have suffered or died of that disease; fever, skin diseases, ulcers, particularly cancerous ones, syphiHs, and gout, he believes capable of similar dissemination. In support of tliis pro- position he adduces various results from his own experience and that of others. VI. ENDEMIC AND EPIDEMIC DISEASES. a. Idiotism. ElOSe,â€”On Idiotism in Silesia, a Politico-medical Slcetcb. (Henke, i.) The author draws a Hue of distinction between cretins and idiots, and allots the former exclusively to mountainous districts, the latter to the plain.

In the rich, flat portion of Silesia there is one idiot to every 3402 iuliabitants. Idiotism in Silesia has a predilection for the male sex, of which every 8942 include one idiot, while as many as 12,214 females are required to furnish one. Idiots are only taken care of when they become dangerous to public security. But the author desu-es that institutions should be established, in which they might be trained and made more useful. b.

In cases of placenta prEEvia, Donkin insists on the importance of the shortening of the cervix, which is, he contends, a necessary consequence of its expansion, and a chief cause, by constricting the vessels, of the cessation of the hemorrhage. He suggests, as a method of treatment, the mechanical expansion of the cervix by means of a sponge-tent specially constricted for the purpose, conjoined M'ith the use of ergot or galvanism. Glisczynski states, that from the records of the Klinik at Breslau it appears that in 10,540 cases, placenta preevia occurred ninety times' Deficient involution of the uterus in women who have quickly suc- ceeding pregnancies, or diseased conditions—such as uterine catarrh mflammation after former labours, &c.—are, he believes the chief causes of this condition, which is mostly present in multiparte In the 90 cases, 63 children lived, ^8 died; 76 mothers lived, 14 died

The great success is ascribed to the after-treatment. No bandage should be applied, and the wound is not to be closed immediately, but exposed to the air for twenty or thirty minutes. Circular amputation is alone permissible when sufficient material for flaps is wanting. Hancock points out that the excision of painful scars of stumps and neuromata frequently fails; and he proposes instead the subcu- taneous separation of the cicatricial tissue from the bone. By sub- sequently moving the part over the bone daily, union is to be prevented. Tloweu's patient, a pale, delicate woman, jet. 27, had been severely burned when nine years old. She had extensive scars upon the right arm, shoulder, back, chest, and neck. There was an open sore upon the inside of the arm, having all the characters of epithelial cancer and reaching from two inches above the elbow almost to the

REPORT ON LEGAL MEDICINE, ETC. 466 I. PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. a. Charities. Blondel.—On Public Assistance, and its Relations to Hygiene. (Ann. d'Hvg., 17.) Blondel's paper gives a description of the administration of tlie poor-laws in Trance, including hospital relief, which there is afforded by the communes. In 1856, the total sum of money expended at Paris by all the charitable institutions amounted to 15,600,000 francs, equal to £634,000. I. Foundling Instittdions. Routh.—On tlie Mortality of Infants in Foundling Institutions, and generally as influenced by the absence of Breast-milk. (Brit. Med.) EouTH is of opinion that foundlings should not be brought up in towns, but in the country, whereby the mortality is lessened. He advises the transformation of large wards into smaller, well-ven- tilated, rooms, to hold not more than four cribs each, to the inmates of which the entire attention of one nurse should be devoted. Wet-nurses are to be provided, but preference is to be given to the mothers of the children themselves. The extensive inquiries of tlie author have yielded liim a rich harvest of statistics, which serve as the basis of thoroughly practical advice. c. Dead-houses. Brunner.—Tbe Constitution and General Arrangements of the Dead-bouse at Volkach-upon-the-Maine. (Henke, 47, Supplement.) A country practitioner describes how, with limited means and against many obstacles, he contrived to build a dead-house, and to induce the people to deposit their dead in it preAaous to burial. Those who are acquainted with the evils arising from the manner in wliich the London poor keep their dead relatives and friends, would wish similar institutions to be provided here. The only dead-houses we possess are the sheds of the workhouses, which are both insufacient and iuappro]Kiate for the purposes of a sanitary institution.

439 POISONS AND POISONING. 6. Barium, chloride of. Walsh.—Report of a Case of Poisoning by Chloride of Barium. (Lancet, i, 211.) A healthy young woman, twenty-two years of age, took less than a teaspoonful (not exceeding one drachm) of cliloride of barium, mistaking it for Epsom salts. Half an hour afterwards she had severe vomiting and purging. An hour later, her face was pale and anxious, the eyes deeply sunken, surface of the body cold, heart feeble and ii-regular.

After twelve hours of in- sensibility, she recovered from the narcotism j but the inflammation of the stomach, set up by the irritant action of the cldoroform, caused her death on the eighth day after taking the poison, notwithstanding medical treatment.

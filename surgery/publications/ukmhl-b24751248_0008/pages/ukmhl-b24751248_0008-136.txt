REPORT ON THE INSTITUTES OP MEDICINE. 122 tenor diameter of tlic brim is greater tlian tlie traiisverse; the sacrum is nearly vertical j the ilium almost flat and straight, from the posterior tuberosities to the acetabulum. While in adult life the transverse diameter of tlie brim is greater than the antero- posterior; the sacrum and the ilium have both assumed an oblique direction. The horizontal rami of the pubic bones also form a less acute angle in the adult. Lubbock endeavoured, in 1857, to show that the organic eggs of Baphm are formed on the same type, and consist of the same parts as other eggs. In the present paper he says, that in all temale insects there are two ovaries, each consisting of at least two egg-tubes opening into a common chamber, the uterus. The egg originates and attains to nearly its fuU size in the egg-tube, and it IS with this portion of the generative organs he chiefly occupies himself. The egg-tubes differ very much in number and length and the number of egg-germs tbey contain varies. It is, however,' probable that in each species the number is definite. Each egg! tube generaUy consists of two membranes. The outer muscular, the inner deKcate and structureless, and lined with a layer of epithehal ceUs. These probably take an active part in the secre- tion of the yolk m aU insects, and are the principal, if not the only, organs which form the yolk in the Orthoptera, Fulex, and the Libellulina. In the earKest stage of development, the egg-ceU cannot be dis- tinguished from the vitelHgenous ceUs (those that secrete the yolk), and at the upper end of the egg-tube may be found ceUs which are neither the one nor the other, but which are apparently capable of becoming either the one or the other. The macula germinativa is a small, round vesicle in the Orthopetra. In Fulex the germinal vesicle IS dark, and the macula germinativa, which is distinct in the young egg-germs, soon disappears. In the Coccus, the germinal vesicle makes its appearance after the viteUigenous ceUs. It is about â€¢0008 in diameter. About the same time the oil-globules also make their appearance, and soon become the most conspicuous part of the egg. The viteUigenous ceUs, Huxley and Leuckart say, are weU developed in the oviparous Aphides ; but less apparent in the agamic or viviparous forms. It is generally stated that all the Apliides are, in spring and summer, self-fertile and viviparous, and become oviparous in autumn. Lubbock, however, tliinks it probable that in cold regions some species may be always ovijjarous.

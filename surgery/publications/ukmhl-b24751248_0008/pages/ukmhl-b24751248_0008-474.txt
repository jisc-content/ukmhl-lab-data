460 REPORT ON LKGAL MEDICINE, ETC. i decisions upon this point in courts of law; as also the right and duty to give evidence, not only in accordance with the letter, but also the spirit of the law. Maib, reports the discussions upon the question of legal responsi- bility which occurred in the Bavarian Representative Chambers, and points out the great difference of opinion which existed upon the principles involved in the question. Schneider details nineteen propositions, which were made by Fleming, and discussed by the meeting mentioned. Trom them we gather- that the forensic physician, in psychological cases, has, or may have, two distinct functionsâ€”namely, the first, to determine how far a case of mental alienation is dependent upon somatic disease; and the second, to ascertain whether mental alienation is really present. Those who believe that mental, are always the consequences of somatic diseases will not agree with this proposition. Plagge, starting from certain speculations, assumes that there must be several degrees of legal responsibility. LowENHAUDT combats the views of diminished legal responsi- bility, which had been assumed by Ideler in two Prussian " superar- bitria," and shows that the proposed distinctions and gradations would lead to great practical difficidties. ScHLAGEU publishes some psychiatrical speculations. BoCKER, after considering the German law, comes to the con- clusion, that, in questions of legal responsibility, the judge must put special questions to the medical witness, referring to the individual case, and that a formula for putting questions relative to legal re- sponsibility does not exist. Priedreich reports the case of a boy, ten years old, who mur- dered his sister. Poverty, immorality, and a tendency to beg and steal, with absence of all instruction, were urged as mitigating con- siderations. The contents of the remaining articles of tliis section appear to be sufficiently indicated by their headings.

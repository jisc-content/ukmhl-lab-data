' Hygiene seems at last to make some progress in Holland, where formerly it was little cultivated. The States General want a reform of the laws concerning the medical profession and public health. Meanwhile scientific men are endeavouring to inform the people on matters of hygiene. The above journal is popularly written, and appears calculated to fulfil its object. b. Treatises, Ideler.—Hand-book of Dietetics for Friends of Health and Longevity. ,d edit Berlin. Wittmaack.—Popular Hand-book of Dietetics. Leipsic. Eeich.—Manual of General Etiology and Hygiene. Erlangen. Wittmaack, well known as the author of a book on rational therapeutics, has entitled his work a popular one; but it is so scientifically fl-ntten that few laymen will be able to' read it with- out a commentary. The section on the evil consequences of pre- mature study and over mental exertion, and on the premature practice of music, is fuU of useful warnings. In another chapter he proves to youth of both sexes, that early fruition is the grave of all late enjoyment. The author, like Ideleu, is a great advocate for gvm nasties, wluch he terms the principal agent for the rejuvenescence of body and mind It is satisfactory to find that gymnastics, M'hich during the last half century have mainly been reintroduced by enlightened schoolmasters, are now being warmly advocated by medical men.

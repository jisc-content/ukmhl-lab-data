That the impregnated ovum maybe developed in the imperfectly formed as well as in the perfectly formed cornu. 4. That pregnancy in an imperfectly formed cornu is usually associated with impervious condition of the passage leading to the other cornu; probably this apparent imper\dousness is due to swelling of the tissues only. 5. That women with one ovary and a uterus unicornis may give birth to children of both sexes. 6.

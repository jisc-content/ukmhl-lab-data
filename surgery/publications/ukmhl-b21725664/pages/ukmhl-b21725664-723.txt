FRACTURE OF THE SPINE. 697 trephining ; and some have recom- mended this in almost all kinds of injuries. I allude to the practice only to condemn it. The spinal chord is generally displaced and compressed by the lower portion of the fractured body of the bones. One cannot easily comprehend what an operation is to effect in such cases. Further notice of this proceeding is unnecessary, seeing that, as far as I know, it has been unanimously discarded by the pro- fession from amongst the list of surgical operations. When the patient has borne up against the shock of the injury, and the more immediate consequences, and when partial loss of sensation and motion has supervened, great benefit is obtained from counter irritation, by blisters, issues, or moxa. But these are not advisable, but to a certainty injurious, till after time has been allowed for subsidence of the immediate effects — for union of the divided parts, and disappearance of acutely excited vascular action. The endermoid application of strychnine is also efficacious in many cases where the injury has been slight — as in the following. A young man was struck on the back of the neck with a leaden plummet. The immediate effects were loss of power and sensation in the whole body. The use of the upper limbs was regained gradually and com- pletely ; and when he applied to me, the remaining symptoms were diminished sensation and irregular muscular action in the lower limbs. The mode of progression was very remarkable ; supported on the points of the toes and assisted by a staff, he made two or three quick steps as if running, and then suddenly stopped, a few more rapid steps and another abrupt halt, and so on. A succession of small blisters was applied along the sides of the spine in the dorsal and lumbar regions. On the raw surface strychnine was sprinkled, commencing with half a grain daily, and gradually advancing to a grain and a half. He made a perfect recovery in less than three weeks.

717 FRACTURE OF THE FEMUR. synovia is increased, and a fluid, perhaps vitiated, surrounds the bone, and is interposed betwixt its ends. There is also diffi- culty in performing accurate adaptation of the broken ends, and in securing retention so long as is necessary for union ; the limb has a tendency to retraction; in readjusting the apparatus, when become loose, the broken surfaces are rubbed on each other, and thus any union which may have been in progress is interfered \yith. In consequence of all this, union seldom takes place by bone; it has occurred, and will occur, in favourable cases, when the fibrous investment of the neck of the bone does not happen to be torn, and under good treatment. Two sketches which, through the kindness of Sir Astley Cooper, I am enabled to in- troduce here, show the union complete : the patient from whom this was taken had received other severe injuries, and very little attention had been paid to that of the hip. But it is an unde- niable fact, that the circumstances which of a necessity follov/ fracture at this point are inimical to its effective reparation. The broken ends are sometimes united by fibrous tissue. Most frequently no union takes place, and the broken surfaces gradu- ally become smooth, polished like a bit of china, and adapted to each other; a false joint is formed, but at the same time the capsular ligament, and tissues exterior to it, are thickened and strengthened, and so the unnatural motion is limited.

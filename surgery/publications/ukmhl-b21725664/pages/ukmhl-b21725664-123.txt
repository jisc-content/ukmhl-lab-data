DISEASES OF THE JOINTS. 97 other, the change is very slight, but the head of the femur and os innominatum are inseparably united by bone, and their cancellated texture runs into each other. Or when the femur has been dis- located, which is a very rare occurrence, the disease sometimes gradually abates, and a sort of new joint is formed ; the limb, after some time, may thus again beeome so far useful to the patient. In many cases, the appearance which the various parts of the diseased joint present, are similar to those which have been already described when treating of affections of the joints gener- ally. Frequently, however, the osseous tissue in this situation is much more extensively affected. Often the whole cartilage on the head of the femur is completely removed, exposing the bone in an ulcerated condition; and when the system has long borne up under the disease, the greater portion of the head, neck, and even of the trochan- ter, is destroyed, the extremity of the bone being completely altered in form, and com.- posed of a loose and spongy structure. A similar disorgan- isation occurs in lum ; the mucous stroyed, the cartilage is often â– wholly removed, and the mar- gins of the acetabulum ab- sorbed, a large and flat ulcer- ated depression merely being left for the reception of the diseased femur; in other instances the margins remain unaffected, whilst the nlceration proceeds in the centre, and the cavity is thereby much deepened. Not unfrequently the ulceration proceeds farther, and an aperture is formed in the acetabulum, so that matter accumulates within the pelvis. The opening is sometimes so large that the femur is protruded through it. When matter has formed in the soft parts round the joint, portions of the bones of the pelvis, in contact with the pus, are ulcerated to a greater or less extent, and sometimes these ulcers are surrounded by deposits of new bony matter. H the acetabu- gland is de-

HYDROCELE. 616 after the age of thirty or forty; and though most frequent in chimney-sweeps, is not peculiar to them. No treatment can be ex- pected to arrest its pi’ogress at an advanced stage; the only oppor- tunity of saving the patient is at the commencement of the disease, when the affected part is small, and before the lymphatics have be- come involved. Local application and internal remedies are not to be trusted to; in the early stage the parts may be excised. An incision is made wide around the wart or ulcer, and the included parts are dissected away to a consider- able depth. When the testicle has become affected, the chance of success is much diminished; but still if the inguinal glands ap- pear sound, and the chord tolerably free, castration is to be performed as the last, though desperate, means of eradicating the disease. • By Hydrocele is meant a tumour caused by accumulation of fluid either in the chord or within the cavity of the tunica vaginalis testis. It has been divided into diffused and encysted. By the former term is understood effusion and accumulation of serum in the cellular tissue, the cells gradually dilating to ac- commodate the increasing fluid, and ultimately becoming converted into vesicles of large size; the parts around are thickened and condensed. This affection is very rarely a local one, but almost uniformly combined with and forming a part of anasarca arising from constitutional causes. When the swelling proves troublesome, it may be diminished by drawing off the fluid through one or several punctures; in the chronic form of the disease free incision is attended with risk, and is besides unnecessary, The scrotum is sometimes distended rapidly by effusion of serum often of a putrescent and acrid nature. This affection supervenes upon ulcers or sinuses in the groin, perineum, or neighbourhood of the anus, in patients out of health. It

If it be considered necessary to remove condensed and tuberculated omentum, it is cut off, and separate ligatures of fine thread are ap- plied to every bleeding vessel on the cut surface ; the whole mass is not to be included in one noose, as was formerly the practice. In the operation for femoral hernia, the position and pre- liminaries are the same as for inguinal. A longitudinal in- cision is made from above the margin of Poupartâ€™s ligament to a little below the middle and most prominent part of the tumour. This is crossed by another at its lower extremitVj the whole resembling in figure the letter inverted; and the two flaps, so marked out, are reflected. Sometimes a single incision, from above the neck of the tumour to the lower border of it, is sufficient to afford room for the after proceedings. For some years past I have performed an incision along the course of the ligament of Poupart, with another falling from it over the body of the tumour like the letter T, with the trans- verse part a little awry. In cases of very large femoral hernia, such as that here re- presented, the incisions, as in the large inguinal tumour, must be made over the situ- ation of the femoral ring, and to a limited extent. In this case the symptoms had ex- isted for eight days, and had been latterly very urgent, there being profuse fasculent vomiting,and great depression of the powers of life. There was a large mass of bowel protruded: this was all returned, and the patient, though well advanced in life, made a rapid recovery. A cast was obtained after her death, which happened several years afterwards. It is seldom indeed that femoral hernia attains such a size. I have seen it in the male, however, nearly one half the size of the swelling here shown. The tumour is often not larger than a walnut, M M

OF MORTIFICATION. 44 is on duty, and continuously exposed to severe cold; but they speedily present themselves after a rapid thaw has commenced, or after the soldier has imprudently approached a fire. Soon after the half-frozen person has begun to feel a little more com- fortable from sudden warmth, he becomes aware of pain, at- tended with a sensation of itching in the extremities, generally the lower, which are considerably swollen, and of a dull red colour; these, and other symptoms of inflammation, are of no long duration, the action speedily runs its course, and the part soon plainly indicates that gangrene has commenced. When gangrene follows the tight application of a ligature, the death of the part seems to depend more on obstruction to the circulation of the blood, than on any diminution of the nervous energy, for we do not observe that paralytic limbs are peculiarly liable to gangrene. The surgeon frequently takes advantage of the fact that a part soon dies when its supply of blood is cut off, or its return in the veins interrupted; and has recourse to ligature for removal of parts, when he considers it inexpedient to employ cutting instruments. Mortification may be produced by the above-mentioned causes, either immediately or consecutively; and it will occur in some constitutions, or states of constitution, at some periods of life, in some structures, and in some parts of the body, more readily than in others. Inflammatory action is seldom so intense as to terminate in death of the part, unless the power of that part has been diminished by previous local or constitutional disease, or by injury ; and the inflammation preceding gangrene is all along attended by symptoms of so well-marked debility, both local and general, that it is frequently designated the Inflammatio Debilis. Of inflammatory affections, the erysipelatous most frequently terminates in gangrene; in other words, the power of resisting incited action is not so great in the cellular tissue and skin as in other parts of the body. The period at which the symptoms of gangrene appear after an accident varies, in general, according to the severity of the injury. As was already observed, the part may be immediately deprived of its vitality â€” if not, symptoms of gangrene some- times appear within a few hours after re-action has taken place ;

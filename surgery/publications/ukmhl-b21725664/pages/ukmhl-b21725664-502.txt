476 EXTERNAL JUGULAR. tinued purulent discharge; change of structure takes place in the theca vertebralis, or in the medulla itself; serous effusion occurs at the base of the brain; the patientâ€™s sensations are blunted, and he loses the use of his limbs gradually; his intel- lects fail, and coma supervenes, followed by death. Active and early interference can alone arrest, subdue, or prevent the dreadful consequences of the disease above described ; it is quite intractable in its later stages. Confinement to the recumbent posture, and strict rest of the affected parts, must be enjoined; and blood is to be abstracted locally, once and again, according to circumstances; afterwards counter-irritation is to be employed, and repetition of moxas or of caustic issues is the most efficacious. When the painful feelings have subsided, and some impression has been made on the disease, the patient ap- pearing to convalesce, the head must be supported by a proper machine for a long time. He will thus be enabled to use his limbs, to move about, and repair his general health, the weight of the head being taken from the weakened column. The 'External Jugular vein may require to be opened for the abstraction of blood in affections of the head ,* or when vene- section cannot be readily performed at the bend of the arm, from the small and indistinct condition of the veins in children, or in people loaded with fat. The vein is made to rise by pres- sure with the finffer or O thumb, as seen in the accompanying cut, above the clavicle. The lancet is passed through the in- teguments and platysma myoides into the vessel, midway between the jaw and clavicle. After a sufficient quantity of blood has been with- drawn, the pressure be- low is removed, and the edges of the wound are put together with a bit of court plaster, or by means of a compress and bandage lightly applied.

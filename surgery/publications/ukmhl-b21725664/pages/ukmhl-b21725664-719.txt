693 FRACTURE OF THE SPINE. to be kept down by the usual means, and abscesses, if they form, must be early evacuated. Detached teeth and splinters of the jaw are to be extracted at the first; if teeth loosen much during the cure, they should be considered as foreign bodies, and removed, otherwise they will keep up the discharge, and tend to prevent union. From three to six weeks is generally sufficient time for consolidation of the fracture. In severe cases union may be prevented by necrosis of part of the bone; or, though the bone unite, the external wounds may not heal, and the discharge may continue till the dead portions separate and are discharged. Fracture of the Spinal Column is attended with alarming symp- toms, and often terminates fatally, from the pernicious effects necessarily produced on the spinal chord, either immediately or consecutively, when the bones forming the column are disjoined to any great extent. The injury is effected by great violence — by the body being projected and alighting awkwardly—by a fall on the breech from a height, the head and trunk being bent forcibly forwards — by direct blows on the spine. Displacement of the bones forming tbe spine, seldom takes place without fracture to a greater or less extent. Pure disloca- tion of the spine, from the rupture of ligaments and fibro-carti- lage, is a very rare accident; few cases of it ai’e on record, and in them the injury was in the cervical region; 1 have only met with two instances of complete and pure dislocation.

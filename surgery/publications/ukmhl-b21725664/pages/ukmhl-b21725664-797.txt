771 AMPUTATION OF THE FINGERS. Various accidents and diseases require removal, either pri- mary or secondary, of the fingers^ or of parts of them. Ampu- tation is most easily accomplished at the articulations, and ought therefore always to be performed at these points, when the cir- cumstances of the case permit. The last phalanx may require removal either on account of severe injury, or from incurable disease, as onychia maligna, necrosis, caries, &c. The operation is one by single flap, and may be conducted in one of two ways. The doomed phalanx is grasped, on its anterior and posterior aspects, by the fore and middle fingers of the left hand; and the articulation is flexed almost to the full extent, in order that incision into it may be facilitated. A straight, naiTow, and sharp-pointed bistoury is carried in a semicircular sweep over the back part of the joint, so as to divide the integuments, and open completely the articulating cavity. The remaining liga- mentous investments of the joint are divided by one or more additional touches of the knife, so as to loosen the base of the phalanx. The fingers of the left hand are then changed from the fore and back parts of the phalanx to its sides, the edge of the knife is passed behind the base of the bone, and the surgeon, by carrying the blade forwards and downwards, forms a flap of sufficient dimensions to cover the wound, and removes the of- fending part. There is seldom any trouble from haemorrhage; no ligatures are required. The flap is turned up so as to form 3 D 2

675 LIGATURE OF FEMORAL ARTERY. The artery may require ligature at a higher point, either in consequence of wound, or for the cure of femoral aneurism. This disease, however, is very unfrequent. When it does exist, it is usually so situated as not to admit of the favourable appli- cation of a ligature below the origin of the profunda; and it may be considered necessaiy to tie the common femoral. The course of this artery being superficial, is easily ascertained; an incision of convenient extent is made in the same line, pene- trating the skin and fatty matter the cellular tissue is carefully separated, and the sheath exposed; a limited opening is made, with corresponding detachment of the vessel, and the ligature applied, close to the lower edge of the ligament of Poupart. But ligature of the external iliac is in all cases to be preferred, for the reasons already given. This has proved successful in more than one case of double aneurism, one in the groin, the other in the ham. In ligature of the common and of the superficial femoral, the vein is in more danger than the nerve, and the utmost caution is required lest it be punctured. It has been woundedâ€”I witnessed one instance of it; the opening was drawn together and closed by ligature, inflammation of the vein supervened and proved fatal. When secondary bleeding occurs, on the separation of the ligature, either after this operation or after that for popliteal aneurism, compression is not to be trusted to, nor should the vessel be tied higher in the thigh. From imprudent reliance on the former method I have known patients perish. An in- cision must be made in the same line as the former, and a ligature placed on the vessel both above and below the bleeding point, as may be necessary. The arteries of the leg veiy seldom require ligature, except for wound. In such cases, the source of the bleeding must be the guide to the incisions, and these should be placed so as to interfere with the muscles as little as possible, always in the direction of their fibres. When the bleeding point is arrive at, the vessel is exposed to a short distance, and tied above and below the wound. During the dissection, it will in most cases be necessary to arrest the bleeding by pressure in the ham, either by the fingers of an assistant, or by means of a tourniquet. x X 2

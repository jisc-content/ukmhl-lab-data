CALCULUS VESICLE. 630 As seen here, the nucleus is surrounded by an oxalate of lime calculus, and then follows layer after layer of urate of ammonia. The dark sand or stone is occasionally, though much more rarely, met with in older individuals; but in them the red, dark brown, yellow, and white deposits are more common. And, in them too, the diathesis or disposition to the formation of one or other va- riety evidently alternates, as is well demonstrated by section of urinary concretions. An alternating calculus is here represented. The red deposit, by much the most common, at least in adults, con- sists principally of uric acid, soluble by solutions of the alkalies. The brown and yellowish are also com- posed of uric acid, often in combination with a base, and are like- wise soluble in alkaline solutions, or in alkaline carbonates. The white is most commonly the ammoniaco-magnesian phosphate, soluble in acids; rarely, it consists of phosphate of lime, not so white or friable as the preceding, but likewise soluble in acids; or it may be a compound of phosphate of magnesia, ammonia, and phosphate of lime, very white and soft, and im- parting a stain to the finger, soluble in acids, but principally characterised by its fusible pro- perty. Specimens are here given of the phosphate of lime, and of the triple phosphate formed as Is usual on a nucleus of uric acid, with some base, or upon the mulberry concretion. The dark, hard deposit, chiefly occurring in children, consists of the oxalate of lime, either pure, or in combination with one or other of the preceding, very dense and soluble in acids. When these, by accumulation within the bladder, are formed into concretions, they are always mixed with more or less of a peculiar animal matter deposited from the urine.

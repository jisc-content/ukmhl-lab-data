VARICOSE STATE OF VEINS. 155 chest, and, on examination, abscesses will probably be dis- covered in the substance of the lungs, the existence of which had only been suspected a short time previous to death. Possibly some pus globules, the seeds of disease, may be arrested in their course through the capillaries of these organs, and thus a found- ation be laid for mischief. A very satisfactory explanation of these phenomena cannot readily be given. It has already been noticed, that the softening of coagulated fibrine must not be confounded with suppuration. The fibrin- ous pulp has commonly been called pus, though erroneously; and when occurring in the veins, as it frequently does, has been generally described as inflammation and suppuration of the vessel. The distinction is important; first because many of the so-called cases of phle- bitis are shown to be of a dif- ferent nature, and secondly, as to the theory of suppuration, on which subject many wri- ters in this country have been engaged in making comment- aries on, and compilations of, the French doctrines, which are not deserving of much regard. There exists without doubt a capillary phlebitis, and the vast importance of inflam- mation, and its consequence in these vessels, will be esti- mated when their great extent and functions are recollected. It is probably in this class of cases especially that the blood becomes contaminated with pus. Veins frequently become di- lated or varicose ; they assume a tortuous course, appear much enlarged, and present

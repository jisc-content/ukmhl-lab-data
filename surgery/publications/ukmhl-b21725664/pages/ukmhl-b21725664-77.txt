OF MORTIFICATION. 51 E 2 until a week after the commencement of the disease, when the discoloration had passed the wrist, and the hand had be- come dry and shrivelled, and motion and sensation in it were completely lost, that a medical man was called in. Both internal and local remedies were then employed, but without in the least retarding the progress of the disease, which in about a fortnight from her seizure had extended a little way above the middle of the humerus, beyond which it did not pass. At present there is a well-marked line of sepax’ation between the living and the gan- grenous parts, but there are two livid spots beyond it, on the outer side of the arm; on the inner side, where the disease has extended a little higher up than the outer, suppuration has already commenced. The integuments in the immediate neigh- bourhood of the diseased parts are slightly reddened and tume- fied, and it is there only that she complains of some slight pain. The hand and wrist are dry and shrivelled, but above this the parts are soft and flaccid. Below the line of demarcation, the extremity is of a dark colour, resembling the skin of a negro, and completely deprived of the power of motion and sensation; but she complains of a disagreeable tingling, referred to the fingers. The discoloured parts are quite cold, and the pulse cannot be felt, even in the axilla. Though she complains much of debility, the system seems to be but little affected. The ap- petite is very good; the skin is moderately warm ; the pulse is 98, and of good strength; the tongue is moist and clean. She sleeps little. R Haust. c. Sol. M. Morph, gtt. xxv. M.

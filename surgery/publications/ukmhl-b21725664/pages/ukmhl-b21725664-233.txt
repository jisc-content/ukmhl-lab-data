207 OF WOUNDS. Thus the vasa vasorum, ramifying on the divided ends of the minute vessels, secrete a substance which is transformed into a set of minute capillaries, and these also, assuming a secretive action, produce an arterial or venous tube, similar to that nourished by the original vasa vasorum. By this process the lymph becomes well supplied with blood-vessels, those from the opposite surfaces meeting, and freely inosculating with each other. These blood-vessels, as already stated, have been pro- duced from arteries possessing different powers, and hence the newly-formed assume actions similar to those of the primary, and thereby interstitial matter is deposited of its proper kind and in its proper place, a cuticular membrane superficially, then cellular tissue, afterwards muscular, and so on according to the primary tissues which had been divided; these parts do not at first resemble exactly the corresponding natural tissues, but, by the continued action of the new vessels and capillaries, they are moulded and prepared for the due performance of their Iâ€™espective functions. If the degree of action necessary for the accomplish- ment of these processes increase to inflammation, adhesion is interrupted till the action be lowered to its previous standard. From this view it is evident, that, besides a certain excitement of the blood-vessels, it is necessary that the raw margins be in close apposition, and carefully retained so, for, by ever so slight movement of the parts, the recent and delicate bond of union will be ruptured ; and, if this motion be allowed to continue, adhesion may be at divers times begun, but can never be perlected. Whereas, if the necessary precautions are adopted, union is often completed in thirty or forty hours, sometimes sooner, seldom later. From a knowledge of the astonishing powers of nature in repairing injuries, many and important improvements have of late years been made in the practice of surgery. In the majority of in- stances it is also requisite that the parts be brought in contact soon after division, otherwise granulation will have commenced in the different parts of the wound, and the surfaces then approximated will not so readily adhere; pus is formed, and, having lodged be- tween the surfaces, acts as an extraneous substance, keeping them apart, and separating them still farther by its accumulation. All foreign bodies in the wound must be removed before adhesion can occur; and, on the same principle, care ought to be taken that

DISEASES OF THE WINDPIPE. 443 advanced period, it can be productive of no benefit, and if any advantage does follow, it is merely temporary. Sometimes considerable benefit will be derived from the use of blisters, or from the unguentum tartritis antimonii being rubbed on the sides of the neck and over the larynx, so as to produce an eruption of numerous pustules. When all hopes of procuring resolution have passed, and when the urgent symptoms occa- sionally threatening suffocation supervene, tracheotomy should be performed without delay; and it ought to be borne in mind, that the more early this operation is resorted to, the greater is the chance of success. It has been repeatedly stated, that the disease is confined to the larynx, and, in most instances, to the upper part of it; so that, by making an opening in the windpipe below the thyi'oid gland, the disease is situated above the incision, the patient breathes through a canal which is in its healthy state, the affected parts are set at rest, and from their remaining comparatively motionless the disease often subsides spontaneously; if not, the various applications to the parts can be employed much more successfully than before; for when the parts remain subject to constant irritation from the movements necessary for respiration and nutrition, all medicines and all topical applications are generally productive of little or no benefit. But if the incision be made into the crico-thyroid membrane, we shall, in most instances, cut into the very middle of the disease; at any rate, the aflFected parts can be at no great distance from the incision, and the irritation of the tube will be a sufficient cause to excite inflammatory action in parts contiguous to the original disease, and already disposed to assume a similar action; thus the disease may be extended. I have performed trache- otomy on a very considerable number of patients afflicted with oedema glottidis, and I may say, with almost uniform success. The disease was speedily subdued, and in most of them there was no great difficulty in closing the artificial aperture, and restor- ing natural respiration. The relief afforded by the operation is almost instantaneous; the performance of it, if skilful, is at- tended with no danger; and want of success will generally be found to proceed from its having been too long delayed. In consequence of laryngitis, or of long-continued irritation in the neighbourhood, the mucous membrane becomes indurated,

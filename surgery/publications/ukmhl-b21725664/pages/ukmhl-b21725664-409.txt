RHINOPLASTIC OPERATIONS. 383 / / \ \ operated now many years ago. Besides, during the healing of the internal suiâ€™face, it will be difficult to prevent it from shortening, and turning inwards upon itself, and thus pulling down the apex of the nose. In the case to which I alluded, a columna was made, after consolidation of the rest of the organ, from the upper lip, as will be immediately explained; and in again performing the oper- ! I ation for restoration of the whole ! I nose, I should proceed on the I I plan of taking only a flap suffi- cient for the apex and alae from the forehead, and should borrow the columna from the lip. In this way the risk of failure will be diminished, and the form of the lip materially improved. The columna might be provided at the same time with the other parts; but it would be more advisable to delay this part of the operation till a few weeks after adhesion of the other flap has been per- fected. Since writing the preceding observations, I have in a very great many instances performed the operation accoi'ding to the plan here proposed, and with the most perfect success. The form of the nasal flap was this. The little pro- jection was made in order to be turned down, so as to form the tip of the nose j as well as to con- stitute a convenient attachment for the columna, which was subse- quently to be made. In separating the connexion with the forehead, a thin wedge- like portion is removed, and the raw surfaces, after the cessation of bleeding, are laid in apposition, and retained by gentle compres-

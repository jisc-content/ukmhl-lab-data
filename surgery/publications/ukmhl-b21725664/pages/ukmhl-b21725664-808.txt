782 AMPUTATION OF THE TOES. the Other must also be removed on account of diseased bone, such as here represented, with affection of the interposed joint. The osseous shell formed by the enlargement of the original tissue encasing a segmentum is well represented. In the ampu- tation at the proximal joint, it is to be recollected that the ex- tremity of the metatarsal bone lies more removed from the web of integument betwixt the toes than the metacarpal bone does from that of the fingers. The incision upwards, therefore, re- quires to be deeper; but in other respects the operations are precisely the same. In amputating at the proximal articulation of the great toe, there is often a difficulty in obtaining a sufficient covering for the wound, on account of the presence of the sesamoid bones, and the general bulging of the heads of the bones. The knife is entered on the dorsum of the metatarsal bone, about half an inch above the joint, and then inclined to each side, marking out lateral flaps of considerable length; these are then reflected, — in making the outer, the instrument being dextrously passed round the sesamoid bone,—and the disarticulation completed. In removing the great toe, along with the metatarsal bone, the bistoury is entered over the articulation of .the metatarsal bone with the tarsus, and carried straight downwards, along the centre of the dorsum of the bone, till near its extremity; it is then inclined to each side, in the manner described for ampu- tation of the metacarpal bones. The integuments are dissected off on each side of the longitudinal incision, and the knife run

OF MORTIFICATION. 45 while in other cases, tension, pain, and heat occur, and may continue for a longer or shorter time, according to the degree of power remaining in the part. Tension often exists to a great extent after severe injuries, from extravasation of blood or serum ; the functions of the vessels are thereby interrupted, and gangrene is inevitable. As the action proceeds, the pain and heat often subside — the parts become flaccid — dark- coloured serum is effused beneath the cuticle, forming what are termed Phlyctenae — the skin becomes dull and livid — dark streaks extend along the limb, perhaps from the colouring matter of the blood transuding, as in commencing putrefaction in the dead body — air is effused into the subcutaneous cellular tissue, causing a sense of crepitation when pressed by the finger — sloughs form, either black or of an ash colour—and the gangrene involves a greater or less extent of the limb. The mortification is here represented as attacking a limb that had suffered from compound fracture. The dark part around and above the protruded bone was in a state of sphacelus. The dorsum of the foot and the integument towards the knee were only gangrenous. The patient was advanced in life, and the state of the constitution such as to induce a belief that there was a predisposition to mortification. The removal of the limb was, under the circumstances, reckoned inexpedient. In some instances, the mortification is most towards the surface; in others, it is chiefly amongst the deeply seated parts. Sudden cessation of pain is generally regarded as an unequivocal sign of the occurrence of gangrene, especially in the internal viscera; but it not unfrequently happens that the painful sensations suddenly cease, whilst no gangrene supervenes, and that a part mortifies, whilst the pain continues but little abated. In compound fractures, dislocations, or severe bruises of the

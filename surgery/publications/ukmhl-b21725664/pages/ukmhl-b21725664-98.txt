72 OF INFLAMMATION OF THE SEROUS MEMBRANES. organised, being penetrated by numerous blood-vessels; and thus the original membrane is, in many instances, much thick- ened, chiefly from the addition of new matter, though also from enlargement of its blood-vessels and opening out of the primi- tive tissues, principally the subserous cellular. When inflamed serous surfaces, which have been altered, both in texture and function, in consequence of inflammatory action, remain for a short time in contact with each other, lymph is effused and penetrated by blood-vessels from each surface ; thus the new deposit is organised, and forms a medium of connection. By this process the parts are intimately united to each other, and consolidated into one mass; or are merely approximated, and joined, at one or more points, by portions of lymph, in some cases thin and narrow, in others extensive and of considerable thickness; the adhering bands either extend in a straight di- rection, from one surface to another, or interlace, forming a sort of network. After adhesions of various kinds have been formed, they are often lengthened and attenuated in conse- quence of the motion of the parts, as is particularly the case with adhesions between the pleura costalis and pulmo- nalis. When they have been of considerable duration, they often resemble the original membrane from which they were deposited, becoming thin and transparent, smooth on their external surface, and furnishing a serous secretion. Not un- frequently, inflammatory action in this tissue terminates in sup- puration ; and the pus, secreted by the membrane, accumulates in the most dependent part of the cavity. By collections of matter, whether serous, sero-purulent, or purulent, within a serous cavity, the functions of the contained viscera are deranged, much impeded, and in many instances morbid actions are excited in them. The inflammation, whether it terminate in resolution, or proceed to serous effusion, adhesion, or puru- lent secretion, is attended with constitutional disturbance, and the symptoms are proportioned to the original intensity of the action, and the extent and kind of its termination. The effu- sion of lymph, and consequent adhesion, is, however, in many circumstances, a highly salutary process, as in wounds and in- juries of the hollow viscera: effusion of their contents being thereby prevented, and the patient being saved from the danger

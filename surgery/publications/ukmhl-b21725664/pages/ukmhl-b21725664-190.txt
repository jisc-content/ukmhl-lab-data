164 OF TUMOUES. malignant disposition. After some time, the consistence and structure of such tumours vary: some are of a loose texture and contain cells; others are hard, and intermixed with cartilaginous matter, or even with bone. In general, the tumour is slow in its progress, though it may attain a very large size, as seen here, if allowed to remain; occasionally its growth is rapid. Besides those tumours which have been described, there is a number of others not of a malignant disposition, which are so various in their structure as to baffle all attempts to reduce them to a scientific classification. Some are composed of a homogeneous substance of almost cartilaginous consistence and a whitish colour; some consist of cartilaginous matter, mixed with substance of less density and of a different appearance; in some, fibrous matter is mixed with a homogeneous glandular- looking substance, partially softened. Some are almost entirely composed of osseous matter; others contain it in small propor- tion. It would be endless to enter into a minute detail of the structure of such tumours, for it may be said that their appear- ances vary with their number. In almost all tumours cysts are found, and the internal structure of some tumours consists almost entirely of cysts, or hydatids, as they have been called;

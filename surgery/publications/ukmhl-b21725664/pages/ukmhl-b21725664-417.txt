ULCERS OF THE LIPS, 391 c c 4 much induration. It is generally situated on the right side of the lower lip; sometimes in the angle of the mouth; the upper lip is rarely affected. I have removed a few malignant ulcers from this last situation. Sooner or later the lymphatic glands participate in the disease; a chord of indurated lymphatic vessels is felt passing over the jaw in the course of the facial artery, and the glands with which these are more immediately connected, soon enlarge and become hard. This disease, though by some pathologists said to be “ improperly called cancer,” differs apparently in no respect in its progress, and is in all respects as malignant as the disease commencing in any other structure and in any other way. Indurated swellings over the jaw, lym- phatic or not, usually depend on the labial disease; they in some instances increase very slowly, in others acquire such volume as to induce by their pressure on neighbouring parts alarming and dangerous symptoms at an early period. Without much increase of size they sometimes attach themselves firmly to the bone, and involve it in the disease. The malignancy seems then to acquire fresh virus, the skin ulcerates with foetid discharge, all the neigh- bourhood is speedily infected, and the patient sinks slowly under the evil.

108 OF INFLAMMATION OF BONE. ifi' I#./ natural condition, thickened, and at the same time opened out in texture. The blood-vessels of the affected bone are much increased, both in activity and in size; and, in consequence of enlargement of the vessels, and thickening of the naturally deli- cate membrane on which the vessels ramify, the bone is swollen and increased in size; its texture, as shown in the annexed cut, is loose, somewhat resembling the cancellated structure, and its sur- face is occupied by numerous foramina, which are enlarged in proportion to the size of the vessels which they contain. The limb is often enormously swollen and indurated. The gelatinous effusion beneath the periosteum speedily becomes organ- ised, nodules of osseous matter project into it, and adhere to the surface of the bone frequently by a narrow neck ; these increase in number, gradually assume a solid appearance: the bone is thus thickened, often to a very great extent. It has been supposed that the new osseous matter is deposited by the vessels of the soft parts and of the periosteum; but there can be little doubt but that it is secreted principally by the vessels which ramify within the substance of the bone, and by the vessels of the periosteum after they have en- tered the osseous tissue. Thus, in the case of fracture, the new osseous particles lie between the periosteum and bone at a distance from the broken ends, where the vessels are enlarged and in- creased in activity, or adhere to fragments which have been detached in part and retain their vitality, but not to the under surface of the periosteum. There is no doubt that thin laminae of bone are now and then found attached to the periosteum, or impacted within its substance ; but this is to be attributed to that morbid action of the tissue, to which this as well as several other membranes is subject. When bone is extensively affected with inflammation, motion is impaired ; the muscles being displaced and retarded in their action by the swelling and irregularity of the bone, by effusion of lymph into their tissue and inter-muscular spaces, and, perhaps, also, by their partaking, in some measure, of the in-

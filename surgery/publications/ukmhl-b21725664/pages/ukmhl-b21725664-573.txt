OF LUMBAR ABSCESS. 547 occasionally portions of the bone perish, and are found lying in the cavity of the abscess, as seen in this specimen, taken from a young subject. When the bodies of the vertebi’te are attacked by ulcei’ative absorption, and sometimes the disease is very extensive, involving perhaps four, five, or six of the bones, there is more or less curvature of the spine outwardly — excurvation. If the disease affects one or two bones, and their bodies are almost destroyed, then the projection is sharp and angular.

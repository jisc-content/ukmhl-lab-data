447 DISEASES OF THE WINDPIPE. Dyspnoea is caused by othei' circum- stances besides those already mentioned; some rare cases are met with in which warty excrescences have grown from the seat of the vocal chords: a beautiful speci- men from the collection of my friends, Messrs. Grainger and Pilcher, is here delineated. Dyspnoea frequently arises from paralysis of the muscles of the in consequence of effusion at the base of the brain, from long-continued irritation, as from an irritating cause seated in the mouth, and in old people from a general decay of the animal powers. In the last case, it is generally a symptom of ap- proaching dissolution, as is the dysphagia which often attends it. Severe dyspnoea is sometimes caused by external violence.

In eight days the tube was withdrawn, the aperture closed ; and no unfavourable symptom recurred. In the museum at Chatham is a larynx showing fracture of the thyroid cartilage from the kick of a horse. The immediate consequence was great difficulty of

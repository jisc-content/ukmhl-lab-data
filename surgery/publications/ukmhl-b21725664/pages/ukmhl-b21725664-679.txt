G53 CALCULUS VESICA. cases, unconnected with haemon’hage or exhaustion, the perito- neum is not found vascular or coated with lymph, nor is there collection of morbid secretion from this membrane within the abdominal cavity, but the cellular tissue, along the track of the wound, is black, disorganised, easily lacerable, putrid; or, if the infiltration has not been to such an extent or in such a site as to kill speedily as if by poisoning, unhealthy suppurations are found, extensive, uncircumscribed, composed of sanies, urine, and dead cellular tissue, horribly mixed. Should fixed and in- ci'easing pain be complained of in the hypogastrium, the part is to be leeched and fomented; this is the only indication of in- flammatory action which has occurred in any of my patients, and it has yielded to the simple treatment here mentioned; so far as I recollect, in only three cases out of more than a hundred, was the leeching necessary. Some patients require support very soon, almost from the first; others evince suffi- ciency of action throughout, and in them it is very necessary to pay strict attention to the state of the stomach and bowels, lest the action should exceed; some proceed favourably for a time, and then become torpid and stationary, their spirits and constitutional power flagging, in consequence of confine- ment and the discharge and irritation of the wound, — such also require judicious support, and perhaps slight stimulation. Union of the wound by the first intention is not desirable; attempts to procure it are dangerous, as conducing to infil- tration ; the presence of the tube effectually prevents both. Discharge and granulation take place, and the cavity contracts gradually and uniformly. By the sixth or eighth day — sooner in young people, and later in those far advanced in life — the urine begins to flow in part by the natural passage, causing considerable pain in consequence of the urethra having been for a time unaccustomed to its stimulus; and as the opening in the prostate contracts, the escape of urine by the wound propor- tionally diminishes. When the natural course is completely restored, the wound closes more rapidly than before, granu- lations soon fill it up, and cicatrisation takes place. Sometimes, though very rarely, a small fistulous opening remains for some time, through which a few drops of urine may occasionally distil; should it prove obstinate in not closing, it may be

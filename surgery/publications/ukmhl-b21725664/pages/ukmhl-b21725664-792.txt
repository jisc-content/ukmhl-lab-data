AMPUTATION. 766 smaller cannot be pulled out and twisted, ligatures must be used for them; and the application of one or two more ligatures, namely, to the large arteries as well as the small, will add to the patient’s safety, and to the operator’s comfort and peace of mind, and can have little effect in increasing irritation. I have made trial of the method of torsion after amputation, and for the above reasons, and because the manipulations are more tedious, I disapprove of the plan, and decidedly prefer the liga- tures. I am not aware that the proposal of leaving the vessels both untwisted and without ligature has been tried in this country; one would think that it must always be troublesome, and not unfrequently hazardous. In some cases, as when the incisions are made in the neigh- bourhood of diseased bone, the soft parts are so condensed that the vessels cannot be pulled out by means of the forceps; they are to be transfixed by a sharp hook or tenaculum, and a liga- ture is then applied round the parts which the instrument holds ; or the vessels may be encircled by a thread passed round by means of a curved needle; in both methods more or less of the surrounding tissues must necessarily be included in the noose, though always as little as possible. Sometimes an artery of the bone, whether sound or inflamed, bleeds sharply; in such cir- cumstances the application of ligature is impossible, and I have occasionally been obliged to insert a wooden peg into the open- ing ; to this a cord is attached by which it can be removed after a few days. When bleeding has been satisfactorily arrested, the surface of the wound is to be cleaned of coagula, either with the fingers or with a warm and soft sponge, the ligatures are brought to the margin at convenient points, and the edges of the integument are then put together by interrupted sutures — two, three, or more, according to the extent of the wound. They need not be numerous, for they are only temporary, effecting partial ap- proximation, and showing the line in which the parts are to be brought together by the after dressing. The stump is then covered with lint soaked in cold water, and this application is renewed frequently so long as any trickling of blood continues. Farther dressing is delayed for six or eight hours, when the oozing has entirely ceased, and the visible cut surface become

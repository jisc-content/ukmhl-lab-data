122 OF INFLAMMATION OF BONE, a great extent, there is no reproduction; the epiphyses approx- imate, and the limb, if there is only a single bone, must be lost. A large portion of a bone, or numerous small irregular portions, may die; but still a part of the original shaft remains, and by its vessels reproduction is accomplished. The articulating extremity is very rarely destroyed by this disease. Many writers have talked of death of a bone throughout its whole extent, and, in fact, the term necrosis was originally adopted on this supposition. The progress of necrosis is, as has been said, similar to that of sphacelation. The affected bone gradually changes its colour, and loses its sensibility; a line of demarcation is formed, and ultimately the dead portion is completely detached from the living. Previous to its separation, the surrounding parts, the portions of bone which are not doomed to perish, have commenced forming new osseous matter, which is secreted in nodules, and from continued deposition soon becomes con- solidated. The commencement of the process is well seen in the sketches annexed, from specimens in my collection. The disease, as represented in the two first cuts, was of the most acute kind, and a great part of the shaft of the tibia had perished.

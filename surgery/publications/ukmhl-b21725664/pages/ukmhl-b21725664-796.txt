AMPUTATION. 770 continues, along with caries of the bone, and partial death of its surface ; and at length it becomes necessary either to perform a second amputation or to curtail the length of the bone. It may sometimes succeed tolerably well when there is but one bone: when there are two, it is al >gether inadmissible. In very muscular limbs, when amputa is demanded on account of destruction of the bones and _3, with laceration of the soft parts, as when the patient is not required to have pressure made on the stump, it suits well to make the flaps of integument only, and to cut the muscles short, as will be noticed more fully afterwards. The advocates for the circular amputation, my ex- cellent friend Sir George Ballingall, and others, wish it to be believed (and this is their main argument,) that the exposed surface of the flaps is much greater than that in their favourite method. Some of the philosophers of the Modern Athens have been appealed to, and have measured, it is said, the area of the one and the other, and given their verdict in favour of the round about incision. The accompanying drawings from nature, and the corresponding diagrams, speak pretty plainly in favour of the other method. In the first there is a cone formed by the cut skin and muscles, with a corresponding hollow and ragged cavity; and the second set shows two smooth, nearly triangular surfaces, which the said philosophers may measure and report upon at their leisure.

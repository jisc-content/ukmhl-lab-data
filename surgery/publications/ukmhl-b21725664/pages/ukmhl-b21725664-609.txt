STRICTURE OF THE URETHRA. 583 in its progress, and imparts to that part of the perineum a stony hardness. Repeated collections of matter may form, and, if the cause be not removed, numerous openings will form in the scrotum and perineum, and through them foetid matter and urine will constantly and involuntarily distil. The patient is reduced to a miserable state, the neighbouring parts are ex- coriated, and exhale a noisome odour, his body and bed-clothes are soaked and rotted by the discharge, and the atmosphere to a considerable distance around offends the nostrils. Fistula in perinea is established. Ulceration and perforation of the urethra from stricture sel- dom takes place anteriorly to the scrotum; but ulceration often is induced there by retaining instruments long in the passage, and may be followed by sloughing of the integuments, abscess in the cellular tissue, or both. Occasionally the urethra com- municates with the rectum in consequence of ulceration, escape of urine into the cellular tissue, and formation of matter. The symptoms of stricture are often much relieved after the forma- tion of fistulous openings; and the cure can then be much more easily accomplished than formerly, the passage being less irrit- iable. When the fistula is free and open, allowing the urine to escape readily, the natural passage contracts, and will become almost entirely obliterated, unless means are taken to dilate it, and to diminish the unnatural opening. Neglected aggravated I cases are met with, in which the urine has passed entirely â€˜ through the false passages for years, the urethra and penis, anterior to the stricture, being both rendered completely use- , p p 4 I i

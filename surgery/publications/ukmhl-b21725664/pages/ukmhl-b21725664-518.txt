The general health is often impaired in consequence; frequently the disease occurs in those of broken-up constitution, along with sores and eruptions on other parts of the surface, ulcerations of the mucous membranes, and other indications of cachexia. By judicious exhibition of purgatives, antibilious medicines, and preparations of sarsaparilla, and by regulation of diet, the general health may be improved. The edge of the nail, when in cotitact with the ulcerated surface, must be removed â€” more especially when the great toe is affected ; not that any undue growth is the cause of the disease, but because the sore, pressing bn the sharp edge, produces much pain, and keeps up the morbid action. About one third in breadth of the nail should be taken away; one blade of strong and sharp-pointed scissors is passed along beneath the nail as far as its root, and by rapid approxima- tion of the other blade the part is divided; the isolated portion is then laid hold of by dissecting forceps, or small flat-mouthed pliers, and pulled away by the root. This should be performed as quickly as possible, for the operation, though trifling, is at- tended with most acute pain; it is quite effectual, the relief is great, and almost immediate. The nail may also be removed by scraping and paring; but this method is not so effectual as the preceding, and almost equally painful. Afterwards the. best application to the ulcerated surface, as to other irritable sores, is the nitrate of silver, either used solid and followed by poultice, or employed in the form of lotion. The remedy is almost specific ; very few cases prove obstinate under it. Sometimes it may be of advantage to alternate it with the black wash. In protracted and unyielding cases, removal of the whole matrix of the nail has been proposed ; the dissection is painful and tedious, and its efficacy doubtful. When the sore is

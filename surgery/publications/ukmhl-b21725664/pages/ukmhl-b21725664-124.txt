DISEASES OF THE JOINTS. 98 From such changes in the osseous parts of the articulation the limb is shortened, sometimes to a great degree, though no dislocation has occurred. Indeed, dislocation is by no means so frequent a cause of the shortening as is generally believed. If the head of the femur has been dislocated, and if the dis- ease in the joint has afterwards subsided, the acetabulum is found to be much contracted, with its margins smooth and little elevated, and, if the patient survive for a number of years, it will be almost wholly obliterated. But a portion of the dorsum of the ilium, upward and backward, which is the most frequent dislocation in this disease, is gradually absorbed, so as to form a sort of glenoid cavity for the reception of the femur, the extremity of which becomes more solid in texture, and more smooth on its articular surface. The remaining neck of the bone is in the sketch here given turned forwards, and must have given rise to great ever- sion of the toes. I have seen one other specimen of this form of luxation. The limb is generally, however, inverted ; and what remains of the head of the bone consequently points backwards. The consecutive luxation occa- sionally, also, though rarely, takes place upon the pubis. Whilst a depression is thus formed, new bone is sometimes deposited round its margins, whereby the cavity is increased in depth, so as to resemble somewhat the original acetabu- lum, the new deposit having become smooth and of a regular form. On Certain Alterations of Form in the Head and Neck of the Thigh Bone. When treating of atrophy of the articular cartilages, it was observed that, in the latter stages of the disease, the subjacent bone was liable to become denuded, and its articular extremity more or less deformed. Now one of the most interesting of these changes occurs in the head of the thigh bone, which becomes polished on its surface, flattened and expanded, with a

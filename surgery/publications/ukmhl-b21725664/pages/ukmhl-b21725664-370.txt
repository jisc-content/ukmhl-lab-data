DISEASES OF THE EYE. 344 appearance of the protruded portions, has entailed upon it the name of Staphyloma Racemosum. Treatment. â€” In the first stage of internal ophthalmia, active treatment, properly conducted, should be successful in averting the progress of the disease ; in the latter stages, there is every chance of vision being entirely lost. The treatment must be actively antiphlogistic, consisting of general and local bleeding, the internal use of purgatives and antimonial medicines, and strict abstinence. A free use of mercury internally is said to check the disease, and, in its advanced stages, to procure ab- sorption of effused lymph. But the inflammation can be sub- dued without the aid of that mineral, though its effects are often powerful; and a recollection of the bad effects which are so apt to follow its employment renders a prudent surgeon cautious in having recourse to it. Mercurial ointment, with opium, rubbed on the forehead, immediately above the affected eye, gives great relief. The same relief follows friction with oil, in which the muriate or other salts of morphia is dissolved. When the incited action declines, the extracts of belladonna, hyoscyamus, or stramo- nium, rubbed on the eyelids and brow, procure dilatation of the pupil, and thereby tend to prevent its further contraction; but whilst acute inflammation exists, the pupil is not dilatable; and it is consequently an encouraging symptom when the pupil begins to yield to the influence of these medicines. In hypopium it is sometimes necessai-y to evacuate the pus when effused in large quantity, in order to prevent the injurious effects that its pressure might occasion; but, if the quantity be small, there is a good chance of its being removed by absorption. In suppui'ation of the eyeball, w'hilst the other eye remains sound, it may be pru-

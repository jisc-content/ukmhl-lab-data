RHINOPLASTIC OPERATIONS. 386 application of a small round roll of linen, supported by a narrow bandage passed over it and secured behind the vertex. Independently of the great improvement produced on the patient’s appearance by the restoration of the lost part of so im- portant a feature, it may be observed, that, when the columna has been destroyed, the lip falls down, is elongated, and becomes tumid, particularly at its middle, so that borrowing a portion from it materially ameliorates the condition of the part; the cicatrix being in the situation of the natural fossa, is scarcely observable. The alae of the nose, deficiencies in the upper, anterior, or lateral parts of the organ, in the forehead, &c., may be supplied from the neighbouring integument, on the same principle as the preceding repairs. In many of these operations the flap can be so contrived and cut out, as that it can be applied without its attachment being twisted. The form of such flaps is here given. It is merely necessary to bi’ing the portion which has been dissected from the subjacent parts of the forehead, cheek, or lip, to the part prepared for its reception, by effacing the angle betwixt it and the connecting slip. A flap to supply the greater part or even the whole of the organ may thus be transplanted. The integuments covering the apex and alae of the nose are sometimes opened out in texture by interstitial deposit, forming a lipomatous tumour, lobulated, discoloured, and intersected by fissures. The sebaceous follicles are enormously enlarged, so as

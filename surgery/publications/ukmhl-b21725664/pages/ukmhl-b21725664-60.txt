OF SUPPURATION. 34 the trachea, and it also appeared to have extended deeply into the mediastinum. The patient soon perished, hut there was no opportunity of examining the parts. In another case of ex- tensive abscess at the root of the neck, an opening was proposed, hut delayed. At length, the abscess gave way spontaneously ; and from the circumstance of portions of solid as well as fluid ingesta escaping by the external opening, it was evident that the esophagus had ulcerated. The cure was very tedious, but ultimately complete, and apparently much accelerated by free counter openings. In suppuration of the cellular substance in the neighbour- hood of the anus, the matter may present itself externally, whilst it is making extensive progress internally ; and if a free opening is not made, fistula ani is the result. The propriety of an early evacuation of purulent matter in important, or very sensible, organs, such as the eye and testicle, is very evident. The lai'ger arterial and venous trunks appear not to suffer from suppuration, for in purulent depots we find them entire, and much thickened by copious effusion of lymph into their outer cellular coat and sheath; the nerves, however, are not so much protected, or do not appear to resist the pressure and insinuation of pus, and suffer along with the other tissues. The most convenient and effectual mode of opening an abscess is with a sharp- pointed bistoury, and the incision should vary in ex- tent according to the circum- stances of the case. The straight instrument, used as described and represented in the “Practical Surgery,”p.9., will be found to answer best in deep-seated collections ; in the more superficial it may be slightly curved. It is used as here shown, only that the edge of the knife should be turned more downwards before the integument is divided by withdrawing it. The aperture

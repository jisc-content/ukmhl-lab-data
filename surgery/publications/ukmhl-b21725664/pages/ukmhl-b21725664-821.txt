795 EXCISION OF JOINTS. of the joint. One is placed in the mesial line, extending from about two inches above the olecranon to the same distance below it; and from this flaps are raised, by making either a cross-cut in the middle, or one at each extremity; in the one case the flaps are four, and triangular; in the other two, and quadrangular; by either method the bones are readily exposed. A more simple form of incision, as described in the Practical Surgery^ will often be found to suffice. The joint is opened and dislocated, and the soft parts separated to the necessary extent from the bones. The ulnar nerve is avoided by dis- secting close to the bone. The diseased portions are then sawn off. The wound is closed, and the arm kept bent. This operation I have performed pretty often, the cases being care- fully chosen for it, and the success has been highly satisfactory. By the sanguine supporters of this operation, the after-treat- ment is advised to be conducted so as to secure motion in the new articulation. From this I would dissent, for if the articu- lating ends of the bones have been actually cut off, the motion may be extensive enough certainly, but both joint and limb will be almost altogether impotent. It would be better to procure anchylosis in the bent position, than to have the arm dangling like a flail; in the one case the limb will be useful; in the other, ornament, and that too of an equivocal kind, is all that it can boast. Even anchylosis, in most cases, can be brought about only after the lapse of a long period. In the more severe affec- tions of this joint, amputation of the limb is the operation which must ultimately be had recourse to, if the patient surv've; and it is better to perform this at once, than after the experiment of excision has been tried and found wanting. I know that parents have too often had to regret and mourn bitterly their having departed from sound advice, and lent themselves to such experimental trials on their offspring.

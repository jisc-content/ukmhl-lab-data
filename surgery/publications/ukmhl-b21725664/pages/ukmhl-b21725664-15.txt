PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION. The rapid advancement made in the Pathology and Treatment of Surgical Diseases demands a perpetual revision and correction of the systematic works devoted to this department of the healing art. Accordingly, Text Books, various in merit and ex- tent, have emanated from the different Schools. Several of these have, by successive editions, kept pace with the Science ; whilst others have fallen into disuse. In this part of Britain, the Systems of Latta, B. Bell, and Allan, occupied the field ; but it being now vacant, I venture to supply the deficiency, by reducing the heads of my Lectures into a Compendium, or Guide, for those Students who resort to this city. It must appear superfiuous to preface such a work by Anatomical Descriptions, Anatomy being now studied more generally, and with greater zeal, than heretofore. Pathology also is more attended to, and better under- stood. To which circumstances are to be ascribed the improvements in Surgical Science, as well as in the art of operating. The functions and structure of parts are more fre- quently preserved uninjuredâ€”mutilation is more rarely A 3

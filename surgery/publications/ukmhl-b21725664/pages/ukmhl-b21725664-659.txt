CALCULUS VESICA. 633 apparatus, his urethra being blocked up by large fragments of stone. It appeared that on parting with me he had been sud- denly summoned to an urgent case of midwifer}'. He ran quickly down a steep street, and at the bottom of it was seized with an urgent desire to make water, which he did in small quantity, mixed with much blood. He passed some pieces of stone with very sharp angles. He went on from bad to worse; he had retention, and the urethra was found much obstructed; suppression followed, and death terminated his sufferings in a very few days. Many portions of the calculus were voided; much stone, with the nucleus, occupied the bladder and urinary passage; the kidneys were dark-coloured, and one approached to a gangrenous appearance. The practice in the first instance, and so soon as the nature of the case was fully ascertained, should have been to cut into the bladder and clear it of the nucleus and fragments. It has been elsewhere noticed, that cysts are apt to form in blad- ders which have been long subjected to irritation from any cause; it need therefore excite no surprise that such formations should be found in patients afflicted with calculous disorders. In one of these unnatural cavities a stone may lodge, both at first small. The concretion receives gradual increase, fills the cyst com- pletely, and then dilates it in proportion to its own enlarge- ment. So long as it is covered by the cyst, the patient suffers but little from it; but when, from the addition of calculous matter, it projects through the opening of the cyst, coming in contact with the coats of the bladder during contraction of the viscus, the usual symptoms of stone are manifested.

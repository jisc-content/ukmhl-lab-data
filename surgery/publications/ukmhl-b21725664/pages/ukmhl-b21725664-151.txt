AND DISEASES THENCE ARISING. 125 tion has been made for the strengthening of the limb, which, after a considerable portion of the bone has been detached, would otherwise be incapable of supporting the weight of the body. The unnatural bulk of the limb is afterwards much di- minished, for the new bone gradually becomes consolidated and smooth on the surface by the action of the absorbents. Nature seems to construct her substitute after the model of the original, and in some instances but very little change can afterwards be observed in the limb. In external necrosis, or death of the outer lamella, reparation is chiefly made by the subjacent parts; and this species of necrosis occurs most frequently in the flat bones. In necrosis in- volving a greater thickness of the bone, the new matter is also furnished by the subjacent parts, which, however, are materially assisted in the process by the living bone, which forms the margins of the void caused by the absorbent process for the detachment of the dead portion. The bony matter is deposited with great activity, and frequently columns of the new deposit cross over the sequestrum, binding it firmly down, and render- ing it almost immovable, although it may be completely detached from the living parts. It has already been stated, that those vessels which ramify within the substance of the periosteum have no share in the reproduction of bone, but plastic matter is effused by the ramifications extending from the membrane to the bone : this effusion becomes organised, and greatly assists in forming the substitute. It has been formerly remarked, that a limited, and, on after examination, an apparently trifling necrosis of the cancellated structure, may produce the most violent local symptoms; the painful feelings, the discharge, and the thickening of the bone, continue, as long as the cancellated sequestrum remains; severe symptomatic fever is induced, endangering the life of the patient, and often rendering removal of the limb absolutely necessary. Occasionally abscesses form at a considerable distance from the necrosed part, and terminate in sinuses, which commu- nicate with the diseased bone, and are consequently long and tortuous, so that examination by the probe is rendered

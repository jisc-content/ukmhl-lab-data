When the curvature is seated in the dorsal vertebrae it is gene- rally to the right side ; this shoulder is raised, and the chest is protruded, whilst the opposite side is depressed and flattened. The clothes hang loose, or fall off on the left side—the patient rests the weight of his body chiefly on the left leg—on stoop- ing the right scapula projects, and, on examination, is found to be nearer to the spinous processes of the vertebrae than the left. The left cavity of the chest is diminished, and the ribs press upon the heart and lungs, causing difficulty of breathing. To preserve the balance of the body, a curvature occurs below the former, and in the opposite direction ; and not unfrequently there is a third incurvation situated above the primary one. The bones of the pelvis become distorted, and are twisted to K 3

141 AFFECTIONS OF THE ARTERIAL SYSTEM. from compression by abscess. Ultimately the sac gives way, and its contents are discharged either externally, or into an internal cavity or canal, in consequence of its parietes sloughing from the com- pression made by the tumour; and such termination is instantly fatal. An aneurism of the descending aorta, in a great measure one from dilatation, is here represented: the patient also la- boured under popliteal aneurism of one limb, and inguinal of the other. He died suddenly, in consequence of the giving way of the internal tumour. The escape of blood into the cellular tissue may even take place to such an extent as to prove fatal in a few hours. The dis- ease may also prove fatal by mere com- pression, as of the trachea, impeding breathing, and inducing disease of the respiratory organs; or by pressure on the gullet preventing the passage of food: in the latter case, however, the dissolution is generally more sudden, in consequence of the compressing part of the tumour giving way, and the contents being evacuated into the stomach or mouth. If the aneurism compress a plexus of nerves, or the spinal chord itself, the anterior part of the vertebrae having been previously absorbed, paralysis is produced. In consequence of aneurism, the circulation of blood in the vessel is obstructed; hence the collateral branches above the tumour become enlarged, and through them the circulation is continued ; by their anastomosis with collateral branches which arise below the seat of the tumour, a portion of the fluid is brought back into the canal of the original artery. The cir- cumstance of collateral enlargement used to be distinctly enough demonstrated in amputation, one of the old cures for the disease. The tumour may be suddenly increased by a portion of the parietes giving Way, and the blood being propelled into the cellular tissue, which becomes thereby condensed, and supplies

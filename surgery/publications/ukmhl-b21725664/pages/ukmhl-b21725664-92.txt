T 66 OF FURUNCULUS AND ANTHRAX. it is better to clean the parts around sores with lint or tow, and to destroy immediately such dressings as have been used. The apartments must be well ventilated, and those who are affected with the disease should be separated from the rest of the patients. The local applications will vary according to the particular circumstances of each case. Strong escharotics may be required to clean the surface of the sores, and put a stop to the sloughing. The nitric acid will answer the purpose well, and is less objectionable than some remedies that have been used ; such as the arsenical solution, or the red hot iron. Of Furunculus and Anthrax.

This, however, is at- tended with but little relief in bad forms of the affection; for at the lower part of the cone is situated a considerable quantity of mortified cellular tissue, which must be evacuated before the cavity can heal. In this unhealthy species of inflammation, resolution cannot be expected; on the contrary, suppuration is the natural ter-

INJURIES OF THE HEAD. 280 by excited circulation and fu- rious delirium, the vital powers recovering from their first de- pression, only to become roused into violent and destructive action, again to sink to a still lower ebb, and be ultimately annihilated. Extravasation is most commo lateral parts of the brain in the situation here indicated; the coagulum is perhaps ex- tensive, reaching to the base of the skull, in consequence of rupture of the middle meningeal artery, with or without fracture of the parietal bone. Little or nothing can be done in cases of compressed brain from extravasation. We possess no means of preventing the effusion, and though we did, the mischief has generally taken place before the patient can receive assistance. Again, the site of the extravasation can seldom be ascertained ; and, should that objection to the propriety of surgical interference not exist, still the coagulated blood cannot be evacuated even after extensive removal of the bone. If the coagulum is small, it may be gra- dually and wholly absorbed, or the brain may become accus- tomed to the pressure of what remains. It is the surgeonâ€™s duty to take means for averting inflammatory action, and to subdue or moderate it when it has been excited. The symptoms arising from displaced bone may be relieved by surgical oper- ation ; but we must premise some observations on fracture, before speaking of the treatment necessary in such cases. nly met with on the Fractures of the Cranial Bones. At an early period of life the hones are soft and elastic; they yield readily under external violence, and it requires a great and direct force to produce fracture of them. Late in life, when the diploe disappears, the external and internal tables come in contact; the bone is brittle, and solution of continuity in it is

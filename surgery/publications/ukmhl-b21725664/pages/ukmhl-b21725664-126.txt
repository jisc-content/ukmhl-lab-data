100 DISEASES OF THE JOINTS. time from absorption of the intra-capsular portion of its neck, generally succeeding to a fall on the trochanter, and sometimes occurring in young and middle-aged subjects. In treating of fractures of the cervix femoris, it will be observed that retraction of the limb is occasionally delayed for a while: hence the great importance of an accurate know- ledge of those cases in which shortening of the neck of the thigh bone may succeed to an injury short of fracture. The de- ficiency of accurate anatomical details concerning such cases led to a doubt as to tbeir existence ; but this question has been completely put at rest since the history and dissection of two unequivocal examples by Mr. Gulliver; and the annexed cut represents the changes of form in the head of the bone, the shortening of the neck and com- parative length of the femora, in a young man from whom these bones were obtained, and who walked about as many others have done, during the progress of the disease. In the above, and in many other cases, the shortening of the neck of the bone is unaccompanied by any absorption of the articular cartilage of its head. A section of another well marked specimen may be here added. This bone also exhibits approxima- tion of the head to the shaft, from absorption of the neck. The head is somewhat flattened and expanded, but the articular cartilage is entire, and of its natural thickness. The acetabulum was diminished in depth, but enlarged laterally, so as to corre-

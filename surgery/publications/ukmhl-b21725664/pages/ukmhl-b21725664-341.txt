DISEASES OF THE EYE. 315 lashes lie on the upper part of the cheek, and the swollen granulated conjunctiva is exposed. The lower lid is generally the one which is affected. The disease may exist in both eyes, or only in one. In strumous habits both are frequently affected in a slight degree; and the upper lid, too, is some- times turned a little outwards. When eversion is of long continuance, and com- plete or almost so, the conjunctival covering of the ball of the eye, and of the cornea, becomes dry and wrinkled ; in short, the membrane completely changes its character, and becomes cu- ticular. In a lad who laboured eleven years under eversion of the upper and lower lids — arising from abscess and exfoliation of the external angular process of the os frontis, following a blow received when a boy— the conjunctiva was hard, wrinkled, scaly, and exactly similar to cuticle: this change of the membrane also extended over the whole cornea. The sur- face of the eye had lost its lustre, and vision was much impaired, the patient being able to distinguish only very bright objects. By such cases, continuity of the conjunctiva with the outer layer of the cornea is beautifully demonstrated. Some of the most intractable of all cases of eversion are the result of burns. The constantly increasing contraction of the cicatrix draws either the upper or the lower lid far from its na- tural situation, and produces frightful deformity. The tarsal cartilages are greatly extended, and in any operation for the relief of the patient it is necessary to remove a portion before the lid can be properly adapted. Great inconvenience is caused by the state of eversion: the surface of the eyeball is subject to inflammation, in consequence of being insufficiently protected; the change of its investing

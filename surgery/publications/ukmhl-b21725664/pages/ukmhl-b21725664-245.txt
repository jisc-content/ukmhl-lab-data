OF WOUNDS. 219 force with which they have been projected, and the resistance which has been opposed to their progress in the body, musket- balls, when extracted, either immediately after the infliction of the injury, or after a considerable time has elapsed, are seldom found to retain their globular form, but are flattened and ragged, and not unfi’equently completely divided by the bones on which they have impinged. A bullet may be divided into numerous frag- ments on a bone, and part may enter into the osseous substance, whilst other portions penetrate in all directions into the soft parts, and, though sharp and irregular, may remain long in the dense cellular cyst which forms over them, without producing pain or inconvenience. There will necessarily be suppuration, and generally discharge of dead matter, from gunshot wounds, in consequence of the bruising of the parts by the ball, which may be expected to injure the superficial layer of parts in its tract so severely, that it must slough more or less. Besides, the bones are often splintered by the force with which they are struck, and loose portions of them lodge amongst the muscles; then they are the cause of much mischief, for, on account of their long, sharp, and irregular form, they occasion great irritation, suppuration ensues in various parts, sinuses form, and the cure is rendered very tedious. In other cases, the bone is split in a longitudinal direction, and, in the cylindrical bones, these fissures are often of great extent. Considering the nature of the body which inflicts the injury in a gunshot wound, and the velocity with which it is impelled, it is evident that the cui’e must be in all cases tedious, in conse- quence of the sloughing and suppuration which is induced, par- ticularly at the aperture through which the ball passed. The foreign body ought always to be removed as early as possible, provided it can be accomplished without much violence, or injury to the parts. Dilatation of gunshot wounds is now had recourse to only to facilitate the removal of balls, splinters, &c., and even with this view, it ought to be employed but to a very slight extent, if at all; for foreign substances, when deeply seated, can be much more easily taken out when the sloughs are separating, and the parts relaxed by suppuration; then, too, they can be more readily reached through a counter-opening, when their situation renders this expedient. In short, the sur-

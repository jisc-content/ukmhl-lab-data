OF SUPPURATION. 4-0 venes; pale-coloured urine is voided in great quantity, often with a lateritious sediment; there is want of sleep, and great anxiety; the eyes are sunk, and of a glassy hue; the features become changed; there is great emaciation ; the patient, gradu- ally more and more weakened, falls into a state of coma, and expires. A condition, somewhat resembling sympathetic fever, occa- sionally supervenes in a constitution that has been suffering from hectic, when any additional irritation occurs, and this fever has been called Irritative. The sanguiferous system becomes more excited — the secretions are suspended—the sensorium is disturbed ; but still the symptoms are accompanied with the peculiar debility characterising the state of hectic. It frequently follows the opening of large chronic abscesses by a minute aper- ture, in the manner formerly described, and is relieved only by free evacuation of the confined matter. In the treatment of hectic, the local disease giving rise to the symptoms, if it cannot be cured by other means, must be removed by operation. Thus, if hectic is consequent on long-continued, but not extensive, disease of bone, the affected portion is to be taken away; if from extensive chronic disease of an arm or leg, the limb must be amputated. In general, the removal of the hectic cause is followed by im- mediate melioration of the symptoms, even though the patient had been reduced to an almost moribund condition : the feeble hectic pulse of 120 or 130 sinks in a few hours to 90, and be- comes more full and strong ; anxiety and restlessness cease, and a patient sleeps soundly the first night after the operation, who for weeks had scarcely closed his eyes; the cold sweats and colliquative diarrhoea immediately subside, and the urine loses its sediment; in effect, all the hectic symptoms disappear, and are succeeded by such as indicate a marked improvement in the power and energy of the constitution; and the rapidity with which these changes take place is in many cases truly astonish- ing. Nourishing food, wine, tonics, &c., must be given, in the first instance sparingly, and afterwards gradually increased in quantity, according as the stomach can bear them ; for it is not to be overlooked, that incautious and too liberal use of them may be productive of irretrievable evils, as the action of the system

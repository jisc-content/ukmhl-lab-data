The incipient stage of such disease may exist without the synovial membrane being much, if at all, affected; but wlien the ulceration has made farther progress, all the articulating apparatus is more or less diseased. It may be here remarked, that the synovial membrane may be affected for a long period, thickened portions may extend over the cartilages, and these may have lymph upon them and yet remain intact. The cure, resorted to by nature, and in which she may be much assisted by the surgeon, is Anchylosis, ligamentous or osseous. New bone is deposited in the neighbourhood of the disease, and the ulcers become, as it were, cicatrised; the arti- culating extremities of the bones are joined to each other by a firm osseous matter, either universally disposed or consisting of processes extended between the bones at various points: or again, in consequence of the effusion of lymph into the cellular tissue, and the consequent thickening and induration of that and of the fibrous tissue exterior to the joint, this connecting medium is so strengthened and concentrated as to retain the articulating surfaces in exact apposition ; from one, and usually from both, of these changes, the joint is securely fixed and rendered im- G

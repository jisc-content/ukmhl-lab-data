OF INFLAMMATION OF BONE, ETC. 128 questrum is formed. When fracture has taken place, when the health has been undermined, or when neighbouring joints have become diseased, amputate, in order to save the life, if it be impossible to save the limb. It is almost superfluous to remark, that leech- ing and blistering are worse than useless after necrosis has occurred, however useful they may be in preventing it; and that the adoption of measures to promote the dissolution and absorp- tion of the sequestra are glaringly absurd. Necrosis, after amputation, was formerly fre- quent ; but in the present improved state of this operation it is so rare as scarcely to demand se- parate consideration. Such specimens as here depicted are common enough in the collections of those who have prac- tised the old round-about operation ; in fact, it is only by this painful and tedious interference of nature that a tolerable stump is formed in many these cases. Death of a small portion will sometimes, though very rarely, follow even a very well performed ampu- tation, if through any mischance the re- covery is slow, and wasting discharge takes place with emaciation. It happens some- times, as when secondary haemorrhage (that is to say bleeding after the fourth day) has taken place, that the flaps are separated by the coagula, and it may be impossible to bring the parts together and give them due support; then the muscles, wasted and shrunk, may leave the bone a little, but the exfoliation is but very trifling. The inner shell of bone, as may be seen in the above sketch, perishes more extensively than the outer; and this arises probably from inflammation of the medul- lary membrane, in consequence of expo- sure, or, perhaps, from its being sometimes of

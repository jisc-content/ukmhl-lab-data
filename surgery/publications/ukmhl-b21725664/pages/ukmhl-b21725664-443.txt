CARIES OF THE TEETH. 417 soft parts. In general, the progress of the disease may be arrested by removing the diseased portion, and stuffing the cavity, before any pain has been felt. But after the central cavity of the tooth has been exposed, filled with a fungous mass, as here seen, or from their growing in a faulty di- rection, and pain consequently experienced, the most effectual remedy is extraction. The patient from whom the specimen below was obtained, perished in consequence of the extensive abscesses of the mouth and neck, consequent upon the awkward position of the wisdom tooth. From the presence of carious teeth, or decayed portions of teeth, many evils both local and general ensue, besides in- flammation and abscess. They are frequently the cause — and the sole cause — of violent and continued headachs; of glan- dular swellings in the neck, terminating in, or combined with abscess; of inflammation and enlargement of the tonsils, either chronic or acute; of ulcerations of the tongue or lips, often assuming a malignant action from continued irritation; of painful feelings in the face, tic doloureux, pains in the tongue, jaws, &c.; of disordered stomach, from affection of the nerves, or from imperfect mastication ; and of continued constitutional irritation, which may give rise to serious diseases. Along with abscess of the gums, purulent matter often col- lects in the cellular tissue of the cheek or of the chin. In the latter situation, the inflammation and suppuration are often caused by the teeth in the front or side of the lower jaw being too much crowded together. When the teeth are crowded to- gether, the patient, of course, cannot be effectually benefited till one or more of them ai-e extracted, and sufficient space allowed for development of the others.

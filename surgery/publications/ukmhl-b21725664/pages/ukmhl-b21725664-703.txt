ENLARGED BURS^. 677 it is to be hoped that the disease will at least be considerably palliated. In the lower extremity, as in the upper, the hursoB become enlarged, in consequence either of pressure or of external injury. The affection may be acute, following a blow or squeeze, but is most frequently chronic, enlarging gradually and with little or no pain, and caused by habitual pressure on the part. From this, it will at once be understood, why the bursa over the patella should be the one most commonly affected. Its vulgar name, housemaid’s knee, marks its cause — the avocations of such persons requiring them to rest on one or both knees, fre- quently, and often for a long time. It also occurs in shop- keepers, and other persons accustomed to shut drawers with their knee, or in other ways to make frequent pressure on that part, — in gardeners, and those employed in similar pursuits. In the acute swelling from injury, local depletion, fomentation, and rest are required, and these are generally sufficient to arrest the swelling, and promote its subsidence; but, in some cases, the fluid is deteriorated and the surface inflames, free incision is required, followed by poultice, and afterwards by simple dress- ing. In the chronic collection of clear fluid, gentle and con- tinued stimulation of the surface, as by the gum and mercurial plaster, causes gradual decrease by absorption ; the causes of the affection being at the same time studiously avoided. The tu- mour sometimes, as here shown, attains a large size, and from repeated inflammatory attacks becomes consolidated. The cyst is thickened, and lymph is ef- fused into the cavity so as to convert an encysted swelling into one of solid consistence. In such cases as these, the tumour may cause such inconvenience X X 3

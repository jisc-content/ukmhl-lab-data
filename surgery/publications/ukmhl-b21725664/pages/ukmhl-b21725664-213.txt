187 OF TUMOURS. and on being freely handled, is found to crepitate, in consequence of the loose spicula of bone rubbing upon each other. Ultimately, the integuments become tense, livid, or dark-red, ulcer- ate, and allow a portion of the softened tumour to protrude, in the form of a frightful fungus ; there is profuse dis- charge, thin, and sometimes bloody; thei'e is much constitutional irritation, and the patient is greatly exhausted. Not unfrequently, during the progress of the disease, especially in the long bones, fracture occurs at the diseased part, either from external injury, or sudden muscular exertion. This oc- curred in the case from which the specimen here delineated was ob- tained some months before the pa- tient submitted to amputation. The morbid structure had not broken through its periosteal investment. The muscles and their in- terfilamentous tissue were sound. The patient remained free from any return of the local disease. Bones so affected, when broken, do not unite, the movement of the loose and rough ends is a cause of much irritation : inflammatory action is kindled in the moiâ€™bid structure, suppuration occurs, the integu- ments give way, and ulcerate to a greater or less extent, and the advancement of the disease is thus much hastened. The tumour may be safely pronounced malignant ; it is true, that for some time it shows no tendency to involve the adjoining soft parts, further than by the effects of inflammation induced by its pressure; but then it is limited by the external lamina of the bones, which confines it to the tissue in which it originated; but after this barrier has given way, the tumour projects through the aperture, contaminating the adjacent soft parts, imparting to them a morbid action, and extending also in the cancellated tis- sue of the shaft of the bone. In some cases, the integuments are tense and discoloured, with large vessels running on their sur-

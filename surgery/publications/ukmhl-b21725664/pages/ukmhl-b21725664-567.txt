541 OF OVARIAN DISEASE. The ovaria become enlarged by degeneration of their struc- ture and the addition of solid matter in great abundance. The consistence and structure of such tumours are very various; they are sometimes, though rarely, medullary, often fibrous, with or without cysts, sometimes melanotic. In the majority there are cysts, varying in size, number, and contents; some- times the bag contains hydatids, or it is filled with curdy mat- ter, sometimes with glairy colourless fluid, sometimes with a turbid and flaky serum, sometimes with blood; and in them, as well as in the enlargement from accumulated fluid, though perhaps more rarely, are occasionally found teeth, hair, and membranous looking matter; some are intermixed with bone, cartilage, and fat. The situation and attachments of such tu- mours cannot be correctly ascertained by examination during life, far less can their internal structure and dispositions be arrived at. Indeed an accurate diagnosis is exceedingly difficult, if not impossible. Innumerable mistakes have been made, which have led to most unjustifiable proceed- ings. In one case, the abdomen was, after two or three dry tappings, opened by an incision from the ensiform cartilage to the pubes; the viscera were turned over and over, but no tumour could be dis- covered. The woman was sewed up, and did not die. The following was a still more complete failure in diagnosis. In a case of large tumour of the belly, many persons accustomed to manipulate ab- dominal swellings considered that extra- uterine conception had taken place; and that the child had come to maturity and perished. The history of the case counte- nanced the supposition; the symptoms had been such as indicate impregnation. The woman, to avoid exposure, went to a distance to be relieved of her burden, which was becomng more and moiâ€™e troublesome and bulk3^ The usual period passed over. It was thought that the head and thorax of an

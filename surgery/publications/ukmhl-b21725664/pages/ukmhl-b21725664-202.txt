OF TUMOURS. 176 what fungous appearance, although such have never shown any disposition to bleed, either spontaneously, or from irritation. But fungus haematodes, as the name implies, is truly a fungus which resembles blood; and as bloody or blood-like tumours are formed from the rupture of some vessel of rather a large size, and as they almost invariably evince a tendency to profuse hasmoiâ€™rhage, as a necessary consequence of the mode of their formation, the term is correctly applied only to those fungous growths which either have at one time emitted a discharge of blood, and exhibit symptoms of a recurrence of the haemorrhage, or which frequently pour out a quantity of blood, sometimes inconsiderable, but often profuse, and generally altogether uncontrollable. In short, the circumstances necessary to entitle a morbid formation to the appellation of fungus haematodes are a fungous structure and appearance, and haemorrhage proceeding from it to a greater or less degree, and with more or less fre- quency. Fungi are frequently met with, but there are certainly few haematoid fungi. The excrescence is generally of a dark colour, resembling a mass of coagulated blood, but of more soft consistence, and its extremity has often a sloughy appearance. It is evidently organised; for, on being injured even in a very slight degree, haemorrhage ensues from the part which has been broken or contused, and frequently the growth bleeds spontaneously. At first the haemorrhage is in general slight, but is often repeated, becomes very profuse, and in most instances cannot be arrested. The vessels in the substance of the morbid mass are diseased in their coats, and have altogether lost their power of contraction; they give way either spontaneously or by laceration, and by their non-contraction they appear to serve merely as passive tubes, through which the blood is poured out by the active vessels which supply them ; the latter are not exposed to any of the causes which tend to produce speedy obstruction of their canals, therefore continue to transmit their contained fluid through their subservient branches, and from this the uncon- trollable nature of the haemorrhage can be accounted for; from the number of vessels which supply the new structure, and which ai'e thus employed, it can be readily imagined that the haemorrhage will be profuse. In many instances, the applica-

INJURIES OF THE HEAD. 274 When a patient is seen insensible, it is highly proper and necessary to examine carefully the trunk, head, and limbs, in order to ascertain whether either fractures or displacements have occurred; for it is by no means creditable to the care or science of a surffeon to be made aware of such accidents when O the patient regains his senses, after the lapse perhaps of weeks, and when they can be remedied, if at all, with much difficulty. In the first stage of concussion, as was already observed, the circulation is much weakened, and it is therefore necessary to adopt means for sustaining and strengthening it; and with this view, warmth is to be applied to the surface, more especially to the extremities and epigastrium. When the powers of life appear to be failing, stimulants must be administered internally. Perhaps the most convenient stimulus is ardent spirit, the only objection to its use being, that when imprudently given in large quantities, its effects, though at first stimulant, become sedative; it ought to be given in small quantities, and at short intervals. Other stimuli, as preparations of ammonia, may be given by the mouth; and much advantage will often be found to follow the employment of a turpentine enema, free motion of the bowels, as well as excitement of the system, being thereby procured. Stimuli, however, should always be used with much caution and prudence, and never unless fully warranted by the train of symptoms under which the patient is labouring at the time; when the circulation is restored in the limbs, and is becoming throughout steady and more natural, all sources of excitement must be abandoned and carefully avoided, as there is consider- able risk of reaction proceeding to too great a height. The patient is to be kept quiet in a darkened room, cold applica- tions made to the head, previously shaved, and free motion of the bowels procured by neutral salts with antimony, or by other purgatives not of an irritating nature, and not given in such doses as to prove violently cathartic. Enemata are in some cases preferable, and are always a valuable adjunct, to the employment of purgatives by the mouth; they procure evacu- ation from the larger intestines, in which faeculent matter chiefly accumulates; they ought to contain assafoetida and turpentine; with these additions more salutary effects are produced than

264 PART SECOND. OF PARTICULAR SURGICAL SUBJECTS. INJURIES OF THE HEAD. Wounds of the Scalp are attended and followed by more dan- gerous symptoms than wounds of the integuments on any other part of the body. This is in a great measure attributable to the nature and connections of the parts. The subcutaneous fatly matter is condensed, and closely attached to a firm and unyield- ing tendinous expansion; and betwixt these tissues and the peri- cranium, a loose cellular tissue is interposed, so as to allow of free motion of the parts. They are highly vascular, with the exception of the occipito-frontalis fascia, and between them and the internal parts, as is well known, a free communication exists. Injuries of these coverings, though at first apparently trifling, and consequently looked upon as of no importance, and unat- tended with danger, often assume a very alarming character. No injury of the head, in fact, is too slight to be despised, or too severe to be despaired of. Punctured and lacerated wounds, more especially those pene- trating all the layers of covering, are frequently followed by violent and extensive inflammation of all the tissues, with severe constitutional disturbance, and with delirium and other symp- toms denoting functional derangement of the brain. The swell- ing is often extensive, involving the whole scalp, together with the integuments of the face, and completely shutting the eyelids. In some cases resolution may be accomplished, but the most frequent termination is extensive infiltration of purulent matter into the cellular, or even into the more deep structures, with sloughing of the tendinous expansion.

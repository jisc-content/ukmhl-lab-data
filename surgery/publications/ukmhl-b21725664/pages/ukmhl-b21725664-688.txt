RETENTION OP URINE. 662 by the speculum, with the best effects. When the menstruation is irregular, blisters and sinapisms may be applied to the loins, with cold bathing, general and local. In gonorrhoea, when only the external parts are inflamed and furnish discharge, the appli- cation of a solution of the sulphate or of the acetate of zinc to the parts, by means of lint, effects a cure in a few days â€” along with strict attention to cleanliness, the observance of rest, regu- lation of diet, and occasional doses of gentle physic.

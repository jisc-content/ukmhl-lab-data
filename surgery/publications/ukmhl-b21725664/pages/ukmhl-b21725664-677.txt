651 CALCULUS VESICLE. It has been proposed to break the stone when very large, to facilitate its extraction, and many instruments have been con- trived for the purpose. I have had no experience of the pro- ceeding, but consider the following description of instrument as the best adapted for the purpose — strong, massy forceps, of considerable length; the blades proportionally narrower, but much thicker, than those of the extracting forceps, and armed with several strong teeth, thick at their origin, tapering gradually, and terminating in a sharp ridge; the handles also thicker than they are broad, that they may not yield to the compressing force, and approximated by means of a combination of the lever with the screw. The foreign body is secured firmly between the blades closed on it; the handles are then fixed by a screw and nut, and compressing force is exerted by the lever acting both as a lever and a wedge. The screw, turned by the fingers, will suffice to crush many concretions; and none can withstand the full power of the instrument. But it is, perhaps, safer to open the bladder above the pubes, and extract the stone through a wound in that situation, when it is too large to pass betwixt the rami of the ischia. When the stone or stones have been extracted, and the sur- geon has satisfied himself that no more foreign matter remains in the bladder, the next step in the lateral operation is the in- sertion of a gum-elastic tube, from four to six inches in length, according to the depth of the perineum, in calibre a little larger than a full-sized catheter, provided with a noose attached to each of two rings at its neck, and at its farther extremity open at both point and sides. It is introduced along the forefinger in the wound, and its extremity lodged fairly within the bladder; a double tape is attached to each of the nooses at its orifice; one is passed up in front, and secured to the fore part of abroad band round the loins; the other is brought under the thighs, and fixed behind. The object of its introduction is to facilitate the escape of urine externally, and prevent infiltration of the cellular tissue by this fluid. The wound, when made according to the directions which have been given, is both conical and de > pendent—the external opening is free, the internal small, the intermediate space gradually contracting as it approaches the bladder, and the inferior part of the wound of the integument

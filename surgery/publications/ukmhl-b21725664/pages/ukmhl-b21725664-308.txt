282 INJURIES OF THE HEAD. well as by the force of the pro- jecting power, and in this case also the base is frequently broken up. In the sketch here given, showing extensive fracture of the occipital and sphenoid bones into the fora- men magnum, the patient, a bricklayer, fell from a ladder on the vertex. He lay coma- tose for some days before death : there was found extensive extra- vasation over the middle lobes and cerebellum. Concussion has resulted from falls when the person has alighted on his nates or feet; but the symptoms at- tendant on fracture of the base are more generally those of com- pression of the brain. In this accident the bones are seldom displaced to any great extent; the dura mater is generally lace- rated, its blood-vessels, and frequently its sinuses, are wounded, and blood is consequently effused at the base of the brain, where injury is most fatal. The upper part of the brain may bear pressure to a considerable degree without bad consequences en- suing, but compression at the origins of the nerves is always highly dangerous and generally fatal. Bleeding from the nose, mouth, and ears, when attended with other circumstances and symptoms evincing a violent injury and consequent cerebral disturbance, has been considered as decisive of fracture at the base having occurred. But we find that such bleeding happens in slight injuries unattended with any circumstances or conse- quences to induce a belief that so serious an injury has taken place : and again, in cases where dissection has shown most ex- tensive fracture of the temporal, sphenoid, and mthmoid bones, no blood had issued from their external openings. Fracture of the base of the skull generally proves fatal, but many cases are met with in which there is reason to believe that it had taken place, and yet the patients have recovered with perhaps partial paralysis. Of this I lately met with a good example in the case

STRICTURE OF THE GULLET. 458 rudely and forcibly introduced, or too long retained, the ab- sorbent action from being salutary becomes morbid, and ulceration is established, which may proceed to destroy the parietes of the canal, so producing an additional and equally formidable disease; or, if the ulcerative action subside, the parts will cicatrise and consequently contract, so giving rise to a new stricture, and narrowing the canal to an equal or greater extent than formerly. Before introducing the bougie, the head must be thrown as far back as possible, as here seen, and brought to a horizontal position, that the natural curve of the upper part of the canal may be lessened, and the passage of the instrument thus facilitated. It is of consequence also to keep the point of the bougie pushed back towards the vertebrae (the patient being desired to make an effort to swallow), and to grasp the larynx with the left hand and pull it gently forwards, that there may be no risk of the instrument passing into the windpipe, instead of into the gullet; if such a mistake should happen, the sur- geon will soon be apprised of it by the violent and con- vulsive coughing which is generally induced, though not always. Bougies armed with caustic have been recommended, but are unnecessary, the simple bougie being sufficient to remove the disease, if skilfully employed; besides, their use is not unattended with danger, ulceration being frequently produced. In very bad cases, in which the stricture is long in yielding to the means already mentioned, and the nutriment which the patient is able to swallow is necessarily small, — when the canal is altogether obliterated either at one point or to a considerable extent, as has sometimes happened, and when there is consequently little hope of success from any treatment — the strength of the patient may be supported, and life prolonged for some time by the use of nutritive enemata. Dysphagia may also be caused by tumours in the oesopha- gus ; but as these are generally of a medullary structure, and

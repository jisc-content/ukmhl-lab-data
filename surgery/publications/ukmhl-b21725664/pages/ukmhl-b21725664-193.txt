OF TUMOURS. 167 protruded portion afterwards becomes discoloured, and sloughs, to be speedily reproduced either by farther dilatation, or by actual increase of the tumour; unhealthy pus is discharged, often mixed with blood, and occasionally slight haemorrhage occurs; the integuments become farther ulcerated, assume a dull brown colour widely around, and are undermined, pre- senting a boggy feel. Along with these local symptoms, there is a complete subver- sion of the system, â€” there being at first symptoms of consti- tutional irritation, afterwards those of hectic and extreme exhaustion. When the lymphatic glands are diseased, the limb beneath is much swollen from oedematous elFusion, the return of the blood and lymph being prevented; violent and excruciating pains are experienced in the course of the nerves of a limb; it also frequently loses its sensation, from those organs being either involved in the disease, or pressed on by the tumour. The vessels in the neighbourhood of the affected parts are materially altered, though they are seldom converted into encephaloid matter; the arteries are often completely obstructed by coagu- lating lymph for a considerable extent, and the coagulum not only occupies the principal trunk, but extends into the minute ramifications; and this explains why haemorrhage seldom occurs, even after ulceration of the tumour is far advanced: the veins also are frequently obstructed in a similar way; but in many cases they contain a soft and pulpy matter, exactly resembling the substance of the tumour. The fungus which protrudes after ulceration of the integuments sometimes bleeds, when it would appear that the haemorrhage proceeds from those bloody col- lections in the substance of the tumour already mentioned. According to my experience, when bloody points, or cysts con- taining bloody fluid, exist in a medullary or other tumour which has been removed, and if the diseased matter be reproduced, a bleeding fungus will almost certainly follow. This species of tumour occurs in all ages and in all situations, and during its progress evinces strong proofs of inveterate malignancy: if removed early, the disease may be arrested; but if the operation be long delayed, a tumour of a similar nature, and more exten- sive, will almost invariably be produced. In several instances I have removed encephaloid tumours, from the situation both of M 4

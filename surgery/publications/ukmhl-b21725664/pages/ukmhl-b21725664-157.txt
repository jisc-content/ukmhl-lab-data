131 OF MOLLITIES OSSIUM, RACHITIS, ETC. the belly is tumid. The bones of the limbs become flattened as well as bent, and in their concavities, as remarked above, new bone is effused, in order that the column of support may be thereby strengthened. The new deposit is of extremely dense consistence, and is effused in greater or less quantity, accord- ing to the degree of curvature. The bones of rickety subjects are soft, cellular, and of a brown colour, contain a dark fluid, and are very deficient in earthy matter. As a simple proof of the latter circumstance, it may be mentioned that distortions of the pelvis can be, and often are, accurately imitated by soaking the bones for some time in acid, whereby the earthy matter is extracted. In many instances this component of the bones is almost entirely removed, and soft matter deposited instead; they then consist merely of an extremmly thin external osseous shell, covered by thickened periosteum, and containing a pulpy substance resembling fatty matter. During the progress of the disease, the urine deposits, often in great quantity, a white sediment, which, on analysis, is found to be the phosphate of lime. In rickets the head is K 2

no OF INFLAMMATION OF BONE, The bone is very dense in consistence, and irregular on its surface. Suppuration in bones is necessarily connected with loss of substance, and condensation of the surrounding parts; and pu- rulent collections exteriorly, if allowed to press long, or if bound down by unyielding sheaths, will sooner or later produce a breach of continuity, by causing absorption of the outer lamella and the subjacent cancellated texture. A similar effect is produced by aneurismal and some other tumours. Such loss of substance is, in some instances, speedily repaired, after removal of the cause, by effusion of new matter from the sur- rounding blood-vessels of the bone; thus, in disease in consequence of pressure from large aneurism, there is reason to suppose that the healing process commences as soon as the aneu- rismal sac begins to diminish, as after operation. But, as has been already observed, the healthy actions are more vigorous in the softer tissues than in bone ; and when ulceration has occurred in the latter, it is generally attended with weak action, and presents the same general charac- ters as an ulcer in the soft parts, connected with a feeble action of the blood-vessels; the discharge is thin and fetid, absorption gradually proceeds and there is little or no effort towards reparation. Cavities in bones are necessarily slower in healing than those in the soft parts; the vitality and power of reparation is lower; and there being no elasticity in the parts, the walls cannot come Iâ€™apidly together, contract, and coalesce. It may tend to prevent confusion of the two different morbid states, if we confine the term ulceration to suppuration in, and absorption of, bone, whilst the vessels retain a con- siderable power of action, throw out new matter, and procure a reparation of the breach ; and this condition of the osseous tissue exists when the disease is situated in the surface of the bone, and when it has been produced by an external cause. On the contrary, the term caries will denote that peculiar kind of ulceration in which reparation is hardly attempted by

148 AFFECTIONS OF THE ARTERIAL SYSTEM. of a ligature in that situation can seldom be of any advantage, the artery being already obliterated, in aneurisms of some standing, a long way beneath the tumour; and it is, perhaps, from this circumstance that, in such operations, great difficulty has been experienced in securing the vessel, and that it has been thought necessary even to pass a needle under a thick mass, somewhat in the situation of the artery. It would appear, in some instances, that the artery when pervious had even remained untouched, not being even exposed by the burrowing process employed by some of the operators ; and that if any vessel was tied, it was not the trunk in which the disease existed. It would appear that a very correct diagnosis had not been formed in some of the cases. The appearance of tLe vessel after the appli- cation of a ligature above the tumour has been already shown. The obliteration of the sac proceeds, in some cases, very rapidly; it assumes a harder feel, decreases, and disappears; being connected with the vessel by means of a dense impervious chord, to which condition that portion of the artery has been reduced. The anas- tomosing vessels enlarge more and more, carry blood freely from above to below the ligature, and thence to below the tumour; some even passing to the latter situation directly from above the ligature. Along with the muscular and other branches, the neurilemmal vessels also become enlarged, and compress the nervous filaments; and to this are to be attributed the annoying pains which sometimes occur in a limb after the operation for aneurism. The enlargement of the arteries of the neurilemma can be dis- tinctly shown by dissection. Immediately after the operation, the circula- tion in the limb cannot be so vigorous as before; its temperature is consequently diminished, and it possesses less power of resisting the influence of stimuli. The limb ought to be kept only moderately warm; for if too much heat be

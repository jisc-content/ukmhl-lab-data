D OF STRICTURES OF THE URETHRA. sacculi. To these changes may be added a great increase of the vascularity of the mucous membrane, either partial, or extending over the v^hole surface, with puriform secretion, or a thinner kind of fluid with minute flakes of lymph floating in it, and ulceration. The changes in the ureters consist of increase of their calibre, which may be capable of admitting a writing quill, or equal that of a small intestine of the young subject. I have seen more than one case of the latter description. The kidney is either found enlarged in its whole structure, or with this condition confined to its pelvis only, in which part the change generally appears to commence. In addition to this, there may be found pus, puriform fluid, and occasionally cal- culous deposition. No age is positively exempt from stricture: it may be said, however, to occur more frequently after forty than antecedent to that period ; it is true that many patients become thus afflicted long before they have attained the age of thirty, but this does not invalidate the general position above stated. Some difficulty, it must be con- fessed, occurs in settling this point definitively.

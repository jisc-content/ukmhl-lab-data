ON THE TREATMENT OF STRICTURES. 00 can inanimate substances, possessing an elastic property ; yet we must think after this manner if we have recourse to the dilators; although, as before observed, I have not been in the habit of using them, I have frequently seen the dis- advantage of increasing the size of the instru- ment too rapidly. They never can be of any use except where the stricture is capable of admitting an instrument, however small; and, in such a case, the restoration of the canal can be effected by other means which enable us to regulate the progress of the dilatation with mathematical accuracy. I would beg also to observe, that doubts may justly be entertained whether, by the latter plan, the stricture is re- moved by dilatation, strictly so called. Many canals of the body certainly, in their healthy condition, admit of this dilatation, and so may the urethra when strictured, provided the al- teration in structure be inconsiderable, since the natural texture of the lining membrane does not seem prohibitory of it. But where those changes have occurred, which uniformly attend cases of any considerable duration and severity, it is more probable that the pressure of the

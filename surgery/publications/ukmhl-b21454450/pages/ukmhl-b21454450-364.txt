ON TRACHEOTOMY. the first named variety I have seen three ex- amples, and to shew the necessity of bearing these facts in our recollection, one of them occurred in a patient on whom it was proposed to perform tracheotomy : the particulars I shall presently mention. In concluding the remarks which I have to offer on the operation, I would observe, that no patient on whom it has been performed should be left one minute, for at least several days afterwards. The chief source of suffering and danger results from the liability of the tube to become clogged with mucus, which, if not instantly removed, might produce suffocation. Instead of annoying the patient by the repeated introduction of other tubes, or by the removal of one over the other, supposing that a double tube had been intro- duced, the following proceeding should be em- ployed:â€”Two probes surrounded by lint well secured to them should be kept in readiness, their points being very slightly curved.

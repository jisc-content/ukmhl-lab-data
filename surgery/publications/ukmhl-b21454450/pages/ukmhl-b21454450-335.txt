TUMOURS IN THE GROIN. oUl and the tumour felt so exactly like a small femo- ral hernia, that I should have applied one with- out exposing the parts (the usual mode adopted with regard to females in the Truss Society, where daily practice renders ocular demonstra- tion unnecessary), had it not occurred to me that the tumour did not occupy the situation of the femoral aperture. The first thing which I observed on examining the parts, was that the small cataneous veins were in an enlarged condition, minute inspection shewing the thigh to be variously studded with little clusters of venous ramifications, and on tracing the vena saphena up the thigh, the nature of the tumour was sufficiently manifest. It should be remem- bered, that a tumour of this kind recedes on pressure, and in the recumbent position, and receives an impulse on coughing.

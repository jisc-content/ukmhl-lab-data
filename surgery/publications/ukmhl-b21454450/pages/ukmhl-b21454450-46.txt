12 OF STRICTURES OF THE URETHRA. when strictures form anteriorly to one which has existed some time previous, it is probable that they owe their origin to the influence of the same principle. The causes hitherto mentioned operate by a continued irritating influence. Violent irritation, without being continued, will also produce stricture, as is shewn by cases where it supervenes after wounds or other inju- ries of the parts concerned.* It may be ob- served generally, that strictures are preceded by a peculiar state of the canal, the detection of which will lead to the prevention of their occur- rence. The condition to which I allude, is the *' Irritable Urethra," the symptoms and treat- ment of which will be next considered. In concluding this Section I would observe, that as the facts enumerated influence the mode of treatment, they should be constantly borne in recollection. * I recollect, some years since, a boy was admitted into St. Bar- tholomew's Hospital, in consequence of having lost a portion of his penis, by the bite of a horse. The result of this injury was a very severe stricture at the posterior portion of his urethra.

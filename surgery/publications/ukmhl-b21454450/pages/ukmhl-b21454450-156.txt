The next object is to convey an instrument through the posterior part of the wound into the bladder; for which purpose the grooved staff should be withdrawn, and an elastic gum catheter introduced in its place. Now the only difficulty which I have seen, consists in finding the urethra from the wound; indeed it has, in some cases, contracted so much as to render the employment of a probe necessary in order to discover it. For this purpose ordinarily you require another instrument to enable you to direct its point to any part of the wound you may wish with facility. But then you have two instruments, the one introduced to the point of stricture, the other from the wound into the bladder. This it is desirable to avoid, since it is inconvenient to the patient, and of course retards his recovery; which cannot, indeed, take place until one instrument be passed

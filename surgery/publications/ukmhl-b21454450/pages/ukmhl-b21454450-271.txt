ON STRICTURE OF THE ESOPHAGUS. 237 culated to do good. Leeches applied along the course of the oesophagus are sometimes of considerable benefit, and should never, in my opinion, be neglected. The food should be light and nutritious, and chiefly of pulpy fari- naceous substances; these being generally well adapted for the health of the individual, and ad- mitting of more easy deglutition than any thing which is absolutely fluid. The patient should be kept as tranquil as possible, and receive every encouragement from the surgeon, which the confidence reposed in him so well fits him to bestow; as nothing so readily excites spasms or renders them more severe when excited than mental inquietude. The treatment before men- tioned should be adopted for a few days when the symptoms are not excessively urgent, before any attempt be made to pass an instrument; and if the surgeon and patient be strangers to each other, there is some advantage in an inter- view or two taking place previously to the ex- amination. It may happen, that on the first trial, the situation of the stricture may be ascer- tained and its nature judged of; but more fre- quently the spasms consequent on its presence.

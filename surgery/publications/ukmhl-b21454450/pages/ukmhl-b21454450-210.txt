CASES. 176 substituted for the elastic bougie, and when it had been introduced six times, all irritability had subsided. The involuntary emissions, how- ever, still returned about every ten days, and as he was very anxious to be relieved from this annoyance, various measures were employed; amongst other medicines he took camphor, laudanum, and hyoscyamus, he had also a seton passed in the perineum. Nothing that was subsequently done, however, seemed to in- fluence the recurrence of the involuntary emis- sions, which returned at intervals. As he had no other inconvenience remaining, and as his health was evidently still disordered, he was recommended to go into the country. I have since seen him, and learnt that this was highly beneficial; but that, although the intervals are much longer, he is not altogether exempt from occasional returns of his old complaint. I have been induced to mention this case, in consequence of the young man having de- scribed his anxiety on account of his complaint, to result from the circumstance of his having taken so much medicine and applied so many local remedies, without the least influence having been produced on the sore.

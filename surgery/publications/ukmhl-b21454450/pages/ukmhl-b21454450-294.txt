ON THE DIAGNOSIS OF 2G0 near the ring; moderate pressure should now be exerted by the finger and thumb in a direc- tion upwards, and outwards, giving the parts included between them a sort of half twist on each other. The tumour has now a general pressure on it throughout, with a particular de- gree of it near the abdominal ring, or external opening of the canal through which it has es- caped from the abdomen. The pressure should be steadily continued, when, in a few minutes, and sometimes in a few seconds, the hernia will be reduced.* HYDROCELE OF THE CHORD. This is the disease which, in my experience, has been most frequently mistaken for the hernia last described, or at least so far as to occasion a doubt as to the nature of the complaint. Collections of fluid in the tunica vaginalis of * 1 have not thought it necessary to make a separate section on the external characters of strangulated hernia. The few remarks which I have offered on this subject will be found in the section on " Femoral Hernia," and they apply so nearly in common to both varieties, that the mention of them, in connexion with ingumal hernia, has been deemed superfluous.

^ OF STRICTURES OF THE URETHRA. Every part of the urethra, excepting its pros- tatic portion, is liable to become contracted by this disease; but it occurs more frequently in some situations than in others. In no situation, however, are strictures more frequently found, than in the membranous portion, and espe- cially in that part of it which is immediately posterior to the bulb ; they also very commonly occur immediately anterior to this commence- ment of the corpus spongiosum. From this point forward every part is liable to contraction, but not equally. The three inches next to the bulb are more frequently affected than the remaining portion, and the external orifice is but seldom the seat of stricture, where, never- theless, it occasionally occurs.

The opening of the urethra was on the inferior surface of the penis, about a third of an inch behind the natural situation. The na- tural orifice appeared to be closed by a thick and moderately firm membrane. This I divided; and, by means of a pointed instrument, brought the two openings in continuity with the canal

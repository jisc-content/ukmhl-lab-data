Drastic purgatives frequently produce great irritation in the rectum, and they exert a still more noxious influence when that bowel is pre- viously disordered by accumulated faeces or otherwise. The causes which depend on its sympathy with, or juxta position to, surround- ing parts, refer to disease or irritation existing in the urinary or genital organs.

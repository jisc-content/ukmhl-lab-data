<J^^ ON TRACHEOTOMY. portions of them necrosed. 1 have also seen an ulcerated opening communicating with the pharynx; the whole surface of the larynx is usually lined by a layer of pus, with alight froth intermixed with it. Too often the lungs are found also diseased, having either puriform effusion into the ramifications of the bronchi, or suppurating tubercles in their parenchymatous structure. I have, however, observed other cases where the lungs have been perfectly sound, nor do I believe that they generally become affected, in consequence of disease in the larynx abstractedly, unless it has been allowed to go on for an improper period. The habitual impediment to respiration, consequent on chronic disease of the larynx, must certainly keep the lungs in a state of irritation and dis- turbance, well calculated to induce disease; and if with such an exciting cause there be any pre-disposition to pulmonary disease, some morbid condition of these viscera will most probably supervene in the laryngeal affection, but this, so far from militating against the per- formance of tracheotomy, is, in ray opinion, (subject to the conditions to be mentioned).

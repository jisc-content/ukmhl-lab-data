180 CASES. CASE VI. OF THAT DESCRIPTION IN WHICH I EMPLOY THE KALI PURUM. Anthony De Paer, aet. forty-two, applied for relief at the Finsbury Dispensary, with the fol- lowing symptoms:â€”Has great difficulty in making water, attended with a burning sensa- tion along the course of the urethra; his stream is exceedingly small, and micturition very fre- quent ; he is much disturbed at night by a per- petual desire to make water, and when he goes to sleep the urine passes from him without his being conscious of it. His complaints have existed for about two years, during which time they have been gradually increasing in severity. Leeches are ordered to the perineum, his bowels directed to be freely opened by calomel and jalap, fomentations night and morning, suppo- sitories of opium and hyoscyamus introduced at night into the rectum; and he was desired to apply again in a few days. A small elastic gum bougie now passed readily down to the membranous portion of the urethra, where its progress was opposed; on reaching this point.

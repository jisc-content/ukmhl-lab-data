ON THE INTRODUCTION lower and lateral parts of the canal. On reaching the bulb, the handle should be de- pressed as the instrument proceeds, when it will usually enter the bladder. The obstacles which impede the passage of instruments, may be divided into those which result from the natural structure of the parts, and those which are the consequences of disease. For the sake of brevity, I shall consider together the means by which they are to be overcome, or avoided. When any obstacle is encountered, the instrument should be gently pressed against it, for a few seconds or a minute; if we are un- able to proceed, it should be withdrawn to the extent of an inch, and again gently pressed forwards, its point being directed to the lower or lateral parts of the canal, to avoid the lacunae, one of which it may have entered, and which lie chiefly on its dorsal surface. If this do not succeed, we may suspect that the opening through the contracted part is not central, but that its situation may be superior, inferior, or lateral; wherefore, the direction of the instru- ment should be varied accordingly. Sometimes, when the extremity of the instrument has

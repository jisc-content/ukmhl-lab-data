It is either con- fined to a small space presenting an aperture, the edges of which are acute, which aperture may be of a rounded form or a mere slit, the bowel being free on either side of it, or the con- traction occupies an inch or two, and there is a general thickening of the bowel apparently commencing in its muscular structure. To these appearances may be added ulceration of the stricture or bowel, or both. It is not un- common to find the neighbouring surface of the bowel covered with firm flesh, like prominences such as might be supposed to result from haemorrhoids, the blood of which had been absorbed. Piles and fistulee not unfrequently exist in connexion with these appearances, of which there is a very fine specimen in the museum of the college.* The situation of the contraction is generally within reach of a long finger, sometimes higher, even to the extent of several inches. Strictures have been found in * A morbid condition of the rectum has been mentioned by Mr. Copeland, from Portal, in which a folding of the inner mem- brane of the bowel takes place, obscurely representing a valvular structure. I am confident that I have felt this in the living body, but I have never had an opportunity of ascertaining it by dissection.

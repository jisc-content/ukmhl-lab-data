Xll PnEFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION. taught in the schools, that its addition was con- sidered to be unnecessary. Should I find that this is deemed an omission, I can only say, that should there ever be a second edition, it shall be then subjoined; and in such a form that it may be procured separately. I may observe, that I do not pretend to instruct those M^ho, like myself, have had opportunities of consulting the book of nature; wherefore I address myself chiefly to students and junior practitioners. Should any of my elder brethren peruse the work, it will certainly be interesting to know whether their experience has led them to form corresponding opinions. If, however, the book render the treatment of strictures less arduous to the student, or if it be found to contain what is useful in connexion with stricture in a smaller compass than other works, my object will be fully accomplished. With regard to style, I am fully aware that I have need of some claim to the indulgence of the reader.

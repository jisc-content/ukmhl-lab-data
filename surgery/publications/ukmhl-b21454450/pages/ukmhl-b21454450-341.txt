TUMOURS IN THE GROIK. OU/ X 2 patient's life may be the sacrifice of any inde- cision leading to the further postponement of the operation. The following cases will illus- trate some of the foregoing observations. CASE OF REDUCIBLE FEMORAL HERNIA LYING BEHIND AN INFLAMED GLAND. A woman applied to the Truss Society for information concerning a tumour in the groin. Examination detected an enlarged and inflamed gland, in the situation of the femoral hernia, there being nothing else remarkable about it, except a very obscure impulse on coughing; she was ordered to poultice the part, to keep quiet, to take some aperient medicine, and to come again in a few days. After an interval of a week, she again presented herself. On ex- amination, the swelling of the gland had sub- sided, and we were thus enabled to detect a very small hernia, which was palpably intes- tinal.

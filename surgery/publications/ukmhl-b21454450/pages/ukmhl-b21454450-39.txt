OF STRICTURES OF THE URETHRA. 5 In some instances it proceeds so far, that no similarity with its healthy condition is discov^er- able, appearing almost of a cartilaginous tex- ture, whilst in others scarcely any change can be observed; and there are degrees of alteration intermediate between these extremes. Where the contraction is considerable, and the mem- brane but little altered, there is a thickening produced by deposition exterior to it. The change of structure is generally proportionate with the duration of the complaint; and if this have been very long, the whole of the urinary organs usually becomes more or less diseased. There is no morbid condition of the bladder, ureter, or kidney, which may not co-exist with stricture of the urethra. Those which, either separately or in combination, are more gene- rally found, as the consequences of diseased urethra, are the following: thickening of the bladder in its muscular and mucous structure ; if the latter be in a great degree, the rugse, which are usually seen in its collapsed state, become enlarged so as to resemble in size the carnese columnse of the heart; the interspaces between tliem, being developed so as to form

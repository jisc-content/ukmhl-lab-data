42 ON THE SYMPTOMS OF STRICTURE. observation which can, T believe, be obtained no where besides. Presuming the fact to be established, the practical inference is certainly important.* For in addition to the other well known character and consequences of strictures, it shows how necessary it is that the treatment for their removal should be commenced at an early stage of the disease. In ordinary micturition, when the bladder is but very mo- derately distended, the abdominal muscles and diaphragm are, as it were, instinctively put in action to assist in the commencement of the urinary evacuation; and in stricture the ef- forts of these powers are so gradually in- creased, that a patient is but little aware of the force which they are exercising. Further, it may be suggested that the position in which a patient stands during micturition may, in a degree, be considered favourable to the occur- rence to which I have referred as resulting from the combined influence of the abdominal muscles * Mr. Lawrence has observed facts analogous to those here men- tioned.â€”See his valuable Treatise on Ruptures, page 18, second edition.

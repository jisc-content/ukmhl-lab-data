ON THE DIAGNOSIS OF 278 will be found still more considerable,* and will of itself, in all probability, induce the surgeon to examine the tumour very attentively before he delivers his opinion on its nature. The examination should be conducted in the follow- ing manner:â€”Instead of rendering the skin very tense over the tumour, so much pressure only should be exerted, as may be necessary to do away with any corrugation of the scrotum, which may be present, where the swelling has not acquired much magnitude, just so (if I may borrow a term) as to make the scrotum lie flush on the tumour below it; thus abolishing any space between them which may yet be occupied by the ordinary reticular cellular tissue. This degree of tension then being adjusted by one hand, the examiner should press lightly with two fingers of the other, when he will feel a sensation of fluctuation; then, pressing more deeply, the integuments will so far yield as to enable him to distinguish the firm resistance * I know that some surgeons attach no importance to the difference in weight between hcematocele and hydro-sarcocele. I can only say, that it has appeared to me to be a distinction justified by experience.

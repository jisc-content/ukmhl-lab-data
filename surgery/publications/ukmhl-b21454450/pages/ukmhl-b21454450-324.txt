ON THE DIAGNOSIS OF 290 matic chord is more confounded with the general swelling, than in a reducible omental hernia, from which, with a little careful exami- nation, it is generally distinguishable. IRREDUCIBLE OMENTAL HERNIAâ€”(INGUINAL). When a tumour is found in the course of the spermatic chord which has existed for a con- siderable period, having undergone no consider- able alteration in its volume, which is firm and inelastic, and which cannot be returned into the abdomen, it may be suspected to be an omental hernia. If with these characters, the patient speak confidently as to its having occurred suddenly, to its having for some time disappeared 4n the recumbent position, and if he be occasionally subject to disordered bowels, or stomachic irritation, the nature of the case may be con- sidered as no longer doubtful.

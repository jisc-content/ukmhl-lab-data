210 ON STRICTURE OF THE RECTUM. the sigmoid flexure of the colon, but they are very rare, and, certainly, those who fancy that they have removed strictures in this part, must, I think, have deceived themselves. Stricture in the sigmoid flexure appears to rae wholly out of the reach of surgery; but if the contraction be at the sigmoid flexure, that is, at the upper extremity of the rectum, it is certainly acces- sible by a bougie. Patients labouring under stricture of the rectum but seldom present themselves for treatment with any idea of the real cause of their sufferings. Habitually cos- tive bowels, or an uncomfortably lax condition of these viscera, piles, abscess, or fistula, are each in difl'erent cases the symptom, for the relief of which the patient first seeks assistance. In a few cases, the feeling of obstruction in the bowel has certainly occurred to the patient, but where this has happened in my experience, their attention to such a state of parts has generally been, in the first instance, excited by others. The history of the majority is generally as follows: the patient has been, for a con- siderable period, subject to costive bowels, in some instances from the earliest remembrance.

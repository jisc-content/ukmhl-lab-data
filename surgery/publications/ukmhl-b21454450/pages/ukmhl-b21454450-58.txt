I am, I confess, far from attributing these instances of flattering result to any superior knowledge of the anatomy of the parts in the individuals con- cerned : with this every student can easily render himself familiar: yet I have often ex- perienced the utility of certain manoeuvres, which difficulties in practice suggest, and which the success attending their application leads us to remember and appreciate. Some of these will come under our notice.

OF INSTRUMENTS. 35 other unyielding instruments. When it is re- collected how numerous are the occasions on which surgeons are called to introduce instru- ments under circumstances of difficulty, I feel confident that the prolixity with which these rules may have been laid down will be excused. No written instructions can communicate that superiority of tact, or impart that availing con- fidence, which is the result of experience alone: nevertheless, if the operator bear thoroughly in mind the anatomy of the parts; if the methods here attempted to be explained be carefully observed; if the introduction of the instrument be attempted at proper periods and under as favourable auspices as the urgency of the cir- cumstances may admit, he will seldom be foiled in the accomplishment of his object.

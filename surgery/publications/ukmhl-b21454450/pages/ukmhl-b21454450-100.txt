G6 ON THE TREATMENT OF STRICTURES. were not sufficiently conclusive, I shall not mention them further than remarking, that as far as any inference was warranted, it was de- cidedly in favour of the opinion that the kali acts as a stimulant. The manner in which the kali is applied differs little from that which is recommended for the argenti nitras : the quan- tity employed by Mr. Whately was, however, much smaller; in his work he has published a scale of sizes, the largest of which is not bigger than the head of a common pin. I have cer- tainly often used a more considerable portion without any ill consequences following, yet I see no objection to the scale proposed as a general rule. Mr. Whately recommended the kali to be inserted on the end of a bougie of a diameter capable of entering the stricture. I never could understand the advantage arising from this plan, and have therefore always used it on a bougie of at least a size larger than the stricture would admit. If the point of the in- strument pass fairly into the stricture, there must be a probability of the kali being applied to the healthy membrane posterior to it, whilst the object should be to confine its action strictly

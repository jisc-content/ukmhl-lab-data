ON THE TREATMENT OF STRICTURES. 65 mode in which this caustic acts. It is probable that it acts differently in different cases: Mr. Whately speaks of its producing an abrasion, but there is something unintelligible in this term when it is applied to the action of a chemical substance on living parts. The probability is, that it generally acts as a stimulus primarily, whatever may be its ultimate effect; and that, be the quantity ever so small, it occasionally produces a slough; if it be large, it will, of course, do so. Its usual effect in strictures is, however, very analogous to that of stimuli else- where. Irritable strictures are removed very quickly by kali purum, and in those which are not particularly so, may we not believe, that it stimulates them, and produces absorption. It is an admitted principle, that newly-formed parts are incapable of sustaining vehement action; and if this reasoning upon determined facts apply to strictures, which in many in- stances may be so considered, it readily explains the mode of action by which the kali effects their removal. I have made some experiments with a view to ascertain its precise mode of action when applied to the urethra; but as they F

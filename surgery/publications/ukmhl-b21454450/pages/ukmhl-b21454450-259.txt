ON STRICTURE OF THE CESOPHAGUS.- 225 they happen most frequently in the upper half of the canal. It is not, perhaps, important, could we do so, to fix the precise point at which they occur most frequently, but it has appeared to me that about opposite the commencement of the trachea is the most frequent situation. Examination of the strictured oesophagus presents various degrees of thickening of the tube. Sometimes a mere condensation of it, such as results from chronic inflammation; at others, the diseased part is hard, and when a section is made of it, it appears to be evidently of a carcinomatous structure. In some cases, the thickened portion is very small in extent, and the stricture marked by an acute mem- branous edge, such as would result from an imperfectly developed valvula connivens, only of a dense structure. I have also seen a fungous growth from the mucous membrane, narrowing its calibre so much as almost to render it impermeable. These appearances may be accompanied by ulceration, and this may occur either on the oral, or, more fre- quently, cardiac side of the stricture, which may be more or less involved in it, or otherwise.

TUMOURS IN THE GIIOIN. ^J-^ ertions calculated to reproduce the hernia, will shew how much of the tumour belongs to the femoral and how much to the inguinal variety. Sometimes the two hernise are sufficiently dis- tinct to render any examination of this kind unnecessary. The comparative frequency of femoral and inguinal hernia in the two sexes respectively (in a large number of cases), will be seen in the extract from the books of the Truss Society, which is appended to this paper. 1 may here add, that I operated in the course of the last year on a case of strangulated hernia, wherein I had at first some difficulty in deter- mining to which variety it belonged. The patient (a female) was enormously fat. Some- thing which felt very like fat, or omentum, extended to a considerable distance on all sides of the femoral ring, and in the direction of the inguinal aperture there seemed to be a distinct body, or process, given off from the general swelling. The small size of the inguinal ring, and the vast depth of fat through which I had to examine it, rendered the case puzzling. 1 at length, however, by passing my finger beneath the loose skin from below upwards, convinced

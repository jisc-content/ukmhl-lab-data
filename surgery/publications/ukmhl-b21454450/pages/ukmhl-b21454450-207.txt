CASES. 173 for a fortnight: on his revisiting me, he in- formed me that he had been unusually busy in his employment as a waiter, had kept very late hours, and that the urine again flovi^ed through the orifice of the fistula. He was again ordered leeches to the perineum, desired to remain quiet, and to come again in three days. I was now enabled to repass No. 12 without diflSculty, but the instrument gave him more pain than at any former period : the leeches were repeated. After another week, I again saw him; the irrita- tion excited by the former instrument continued for nearly three days; it had, however, now entirely subsided, and I introduced No. 13 without difficulty, neither did he experience any particular uneasiness. The urine had again ceased to flow by the perineum. No. 14 was passed twice, after the usual intervals; at which time the orifice in the perineum was completely healed, and the patient otherwise perfectly well.

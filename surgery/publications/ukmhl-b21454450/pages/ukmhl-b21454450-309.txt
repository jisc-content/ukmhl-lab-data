TUMOURS IN THE GROIN. 275 cele a full inch in thickness, and it is chiefly this circumstance on which the difference in its character depends. The great importance of the diagnosis between hydrocele and hcema- tocele results, from the latter being by no means so easily managed. It is true that hoematocele may generally be punctured with the same impunity as common hydrocele, and that it may sometimes be radically cured by the same methods; but it is also indisputable, that in many instances the irritation consequent on treating a much-diseased tunica vaginalis, in the same manner as in hydrocele, is very much more considerable, the result more doubtful, and, under some methods, attended by fatal consequences.* In examining a tu- â€¢ I once saw a case of tumour in the scrotum, concerning the nature of which there was much difference of opinion. At length it was agreed that an incision should be made into it; this discovered a certain quantity of dark fluid, within a very much thickened tmiica vagmalis, a portion of which was removed; the patient, however, died. I believe that a single puncture would have given the same information as did the incision, without any mischief resulting from it. I understand a case has recently occurred in St. Thomas's Hos- pital, in which the removal of a much-thickened tunica vaginalis proved fatal. This man had been often tapped, without the super- vention of any unfavourable symptom. T 2

224 ON STRICTURE OF THE CESOPHAGUS. a much earlier age. Although the analogy in the structure of the mucous canals of the body is well illustrated by that which exists in their diseases; yet, the greater or less complexity of structure or function, give rise to certain modi- fications in their progress and frequency. As far as my observation has gone, stricture of the oesophagus is in general a much more insidious disease than when occurring in either of the other canalsâ€”at least, I have never known the latter mentioned cases so slowly developed. In some instances, even as much as twenty years elapse between the first remembered difficulty of deglutition and the application for professional assistance. I consider the difference easily ex- plicable, on that which exists in the nervous susceptibility, functions and connexions of the several parts; but, as the practical utility of such a discussion is somewhat questionable, I proceed at once to the pathological conditions connected with this complaint. Stricture of the oesophagus may occur at any part of the tube; but as far as the cases which I have seen, or the preparations which I have examined allow me to offer an opinion, I should say, that

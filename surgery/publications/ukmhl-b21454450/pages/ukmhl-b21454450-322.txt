ON THE DIAGNOSIS OF 288 through which it has escaped. I can confi- dently assert, that where the attempt to retain the hernia is made by a practised hand, and a good common truss, the difficulty is seldom attributable to either of these circumstances, but to the following.â€”The yielding of the in- guinal ring takes place in a different direction, in different cases; usually, it enlarges from below, upwards and outwards, the two columns preserving more or less of their oblique position; but occasionally, even in herniae of moderate size, the outer column yields in so great a de- gree, as to be brought down to a horizontal line, lying on the corresponding portion of the os pubis, so that a truss cannot be made accurately to adapt itself to the aperture, unless a portion of the pad press on the bone, which patients can seldom bear. If, in making pressure in such cases, the smallest possible aperture be allowed to remain, the intestine or omentum, and especially the latter, will slip out on the least exertion. As this involves a subject not intended to be discussed in this paper, I shall merely add, that if in a case of omental hernia this condition of the ring were present, and the

ON THE TREATMENT an elastic gum bougie, inclosing a wire. If stricture be found, and its opposition to the progress of the instrument prove permanent, after the different manoeuvres recommended, it should be withdrawn, a soft plaster bougie of the same size should then be passed to the point of obstruction, and pressed gently against it for a minute or two, when its extremity will generally indicate the situation and degree of the stricture. An instrument of the size indi- cated should then be introduced, and passed gently through the obstructed portion. We cannot always proceed thus far at once, but if the manipulation be gently conducted, we may, generally speaking, be able to do so. This mode of proceeding may appear unnecessarily tedious, but I have so often passed an elastic gum catheter where the common bougie had failed, that I feel obliged to recommend its use in the first place. Nothing appears to me more desirable than to gain a knowledge of the state of the whole urethra as early as possible; for should we find that there is more than one stricture, the progress of the case will be ren- dered much quicker by directing our attention

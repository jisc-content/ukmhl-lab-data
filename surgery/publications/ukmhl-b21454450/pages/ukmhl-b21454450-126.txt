92 ON THE USE OF ment, it rarely happens that a few drops of blood do not follow the introduction of the large-sized instruments, when the progress of the case renders their employment necessary. It is, therefore, to be remembered that haemor- rhage, even to a considerable extent, does not imply that the case in which it occurs is one of the kind here referred to, unless it be accom- panied with a very remarkable sensibility; it being impossible to touch the stricture with the softest instrument, without exciting pain or producing haemorrhage. I cannot undertake to say what would be the effect of argenti nitras if employed in strictures of this description, since I have never used it. I have not done so, be- cause the kali has never yet deceived me, and because, as far as we can ascertain the mode of action of the two substances, as applied to stricture, that of the kali seems much better calculated to relieve the condition of the stric- ture, on which its hsemorrhagic disposition de- pends.

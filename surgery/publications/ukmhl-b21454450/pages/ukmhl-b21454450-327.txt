TUMOURS IN THE GROIN. 293 magnitude equal to that of a child's head. The form of a femoral hernia is generally more or less round, sometimes it is oval; in the latter case, the long diameter may be vertical with respect to Poupart's ligament, or parallel with it. As the hernia increases, it may extend upwards, above, or transversely in the direction of Poupart's ligament, and in some instances (of comparatively infrequent occurrence) it extends to a considerable distance down the thigh. When the hernia is of small dimensions, its situation is inferior and lateral with relation to the inguinal ring, and mesial with respect to the femoral vessels; its proximity to either of these parts depending on its size, I should not feel myself justified in omitting to mention some extraordinary exceptions which have been observed in the Truss Society. There are no less than six instances recorded of herniae occurring on the external side of the femoral artery. The cases were recorded by my pre- decessor, Mr. Taunton, senior, whose great familiarity with hernial tumours, combined with his accurate knowledge of the anatomical difficulties, calculated to impede or embarrass

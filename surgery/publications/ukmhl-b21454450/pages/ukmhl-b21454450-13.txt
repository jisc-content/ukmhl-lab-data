DEDICATION TO THE PRESENT VOLUME. TO JOHN ABERNETHY, ESQ. F.R.S. &c. &c. &c. My Dear Sir, The publication of the present Volume affords me an opportunity of publicly thanking you for the kind, I had almost said, flattering manner in which you allowed me to prefix your name to the First Edition of the Treatise on Strictures of the Urethra; and of expressing a hope that it may not be rendered less acceptable to you, by the Observations on other subjects, by which it is now accompanied. I will only add my most sincere wish, that your retirement from the more active duties of the Profession may be attended with every comfort which improved health and the retrospect of a life alike honourable to yourself and useful to others, can possibly bestow; with the assurance that I am, with great respect, My dear Sir, Your's, very sincerely, GEORGE xMACILWAIN.

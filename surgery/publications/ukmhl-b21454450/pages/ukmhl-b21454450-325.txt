TUMOURS IN THE GHOIN. 291 OF ADIPOSE OR OTHER TUMOURS, WHICH MAY BE MISTAKEN FOR IRREDUCIBLE OMENTAL HERNIA. Indolent tumours, generally of the adipose kind, are sometimes found in the course of the spermatic chord, and as their consistence is similar, they may be readily mistaken for ad- herent omental hernise. I think the diagnosis can seldom be important. If the tumour be uncombined with any other disease, surgical interference can seldom be necessary; and if it should be at any time co-existent with symptoms of strangulated hernia, the rule of practice is the same, as I shall have occasion to mention more particularly in connexion with the femoral her- nia. Many circumstances render it expedient that a surgeon should bear in mind the similarity which exists between the tumours here alluded to and omental hernia.* For example, in re- * Some years ago, a case of the following kind occurred:â€”A patient had a tumour in the course of the spermatic chord, attended by symptoms of strangulated hernia. The tumour was very properly cut down to, and no intestine discovered, but a piece of substance, having the characters of fat. This the surgeon proceeded to remove; but finding it to be so intimately connected with the chord, as not to admit of extirpation without injury to the latter, he removed tumoiir, testicle, and all. u 2

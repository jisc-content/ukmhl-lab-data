154 OF ABSCESSES AND FISTUL/E canal, in a degree defended by a secreting- membrane. The treatment then consists in removing the stricture; for, in proportion as we restore the canal of the urethra to its natural condition, so will the urine (passing where it meets with the least resistance) flow through the natural passage, and the fistula become closed. In those instances which have occurred in connexion with absolute retention of urine, or in which the stricture is exceedingly con- tracted, the small varnished catheter will at first be particulgirly useful. The French manu- facture these instruments in general of a much smaller size than the instrument makers in this country; they were also much better; but of late the English catheters have been much im- proved, and may, I believe, be procured equally small if ordered. In public institutions, how- ever, the expense of them is an object; where- fore to those who may be interested, I may observe, that the French catheters may be procured very good at M. La Fond's, 46, Rue Richelieu, and may be obtained thence by letter, on paying an ad valorem duty' on their arrival in London.

In furtherance of this opinion of its action, it should be remem- bered how exceedingly minute is the quantity employed; which, in these cases, should never be larger than the head of a common pin. It is then more calculated to relieve morbid suscep- tibility than any remedy which produces a slough: this, though not easily demonstrable with reference to the urethra, is at least highly probable, when we consider the mode in which the morbid susceptibility of other surfaces is most successfully relieved.

The results which so frequently follow the use of argenti nitras, even should it be found to answer, pro- duce, in my opinion, strong arguments against its employment, where the object can be ac-

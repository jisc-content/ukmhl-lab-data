254 ON THE DIAGNOSIS OF ring. Examination of this part discovered a small tumour, having very much the characters of inguinal hernia. As the tumour readily re- ceded on pressure, and as nothing could then be felt on the introduction of the finger within the ring, she was merely ordered to keep quiet, and to take some aperient medicine. In about a week, the bowels having been regularly eva- cuated, the tenderness at the ring increased, and the skin, which had been hitherto of its natural colour, became tinged with the blush of inflammation; this gradually increased for a few days, when the tumour burst, and discharged a considerable quantity of healthy-looking pus. She now gradually recovered, although some weeks elapsed before the discharge had entirely ceased.* * It should be observed, that mguinal hemise in the female are sometimes so large as to distend the labia pudendi. I gave a rough cast of one, about the size of a small cocoa nut, to the Museum of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and I operated about five years ago, on another nearly of the same size which had become strangulated, in which the whole wound united by adhesion. I wish to add, that I have seen several cases of abscess in the labia, but never one wliich resembled hernia; although, in a recent example there was, before the matter was evacuated, a slight impidse of coughing, ^vliich I am at a loss to explain. Like those occurruig in the scrotum, they should be opened without delay, and for the same reasons. (See section on this subject).

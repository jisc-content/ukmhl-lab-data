But a general impression, and so far not an erroneous one, prevails, that if a stric- ture bleeds, it is more prudent to delay the use of caustic, even where it is proposed eventually to employ it. I was much perplexed by these cases when I first met with them. I used various kinds of instruments; every measure that was calculated to relieve general or local irritation was strictly enjoined, and, as I had reason to believe, implicitly adhered to. Still, however, at the subsequent visit, the same failure in introducing any instrument occurred; and, notwithstanding the gentlest manipula- tions only were employed, the pain was still considerable, and blood (in some cases to the extent of several ounces) followed after the instrument was withdrawn.

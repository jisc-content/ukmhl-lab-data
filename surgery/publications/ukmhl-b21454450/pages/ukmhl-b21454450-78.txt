44 OF THE SYMPTOMS OF STRICTURE. a painful action of it after the water has been evacuated, so as in some cases to resemble a common symptom of stone. To these symp- toms may be added, pain in the loins, front of the thighs, darting sensations in the perineum, all of which may separately or together attend those previously described. It may be doubted whether discharge from the urethra, and pain in this canal, should be included among the ordi- nary symptoms ; they are decidedly not unfre- quent, yet I have seen a very great number of cases without either of them. With regard to this discharge, it may be observed, that it has frequently led surgeons to mistake stricture for gonorrhoea. The latter complaint, when neg- lected, leaves the urethra (although discharge may have ceased) in a state of irritation; and in such cases, even if there be no stricture, a muco-puriform discharge frequently follows im- moderate indulgence in sexual intercourse ; and if there really be stricture, it is very likely to happen. A patient thus situated applies to a surgeon, and with soothing measures the dis- charge ceases in a few days, both parties believ- ing that it was gonorrhcea; nothing, however.

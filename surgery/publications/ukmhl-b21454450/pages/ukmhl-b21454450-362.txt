ON TRACHEOTOMY. surface ; for, instead of being able to make that extension of the neck to which I have alluded, we shall find that its degree will be very much restricted by the difficulty of respiration which it produces. The trachea will be found also to move upwards and downwards with consider- able rapidity, so that some care is necessary, in order that the opening be made not only in the centre of its front aspect, but in ac- curate correspondence with the external' inci- sion. The thyroideal veins will frequently be in the way of the operator, and will some- times cross the wound exactly at the point in which it is proposed to open the tube, and these veins, if there be any accompanying affection of the thyroid gland, will be con- siderably enlarged. In a case which I shall mention, a very considerable venous trunk crossed the trachea in this manner, which was pushed on one side by the handle of the scalpel. The division of these veins should be avoided if possible, as the operation has been known to fail in consequence of the blood issuing from them falling into the trachea, and suffocating the patient. This might certainly be prevented

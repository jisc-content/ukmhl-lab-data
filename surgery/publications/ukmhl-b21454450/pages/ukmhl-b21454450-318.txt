ON THE DIAGNOSIS OF exception. The difference in the relative posi- tion of the two tumours will probably depend on priority of occurrence, and the time which may have intervened between the formation of the respective diseases. If the hydrocele have been the primary complaint, and have acquired considerable magnitude, it will probably be rather in front of the hernia. It should be observed, that the co-existence of hernia and hydrocele does not disable us from ascertaining by careful examination the distinctive charac- ters of either. These I need not again parti- cularize, and they will alone be sufficient where the tumours are small, to demonstrate the nature of the case. It is only where the tumours are both large and in close proximity, that any difficulty can possibly arise.

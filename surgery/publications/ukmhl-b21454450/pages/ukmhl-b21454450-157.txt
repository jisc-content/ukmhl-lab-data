In order to meet this objection, the surgeon should be provided with a long elastic gum tube, at least twice the length of the ordinary catheter: for then he can draw so considerable a portion of it through, from the anterior part of the canal, as will enable him to turn round the point and direct it to any part of the wound, in his endea- vours to find the urethra, with the same facility as if he were employing a separate instrument. Having passed the catheter onwards to the bladder, the surgeon should then withdraw so much of its length through the glans penis, as only to leave that ordinarily given to cathe- ters in the canal, and cut off the superfluous portion.* It is right to leave the instrument in the canal for several days at least, in order that the parts may have every opportunity of healing over as quickly as possible. If it be withdrawn at an earlier period, considerable difficulty may be experienced in again introducing it into the * Should the surgeon not be provided with an instrument of this kind, he must allow the catheter introduced by the wound to remain for a few days. The urethra will now be so much more easily dis- coverable, that an ordinary catheter may be passed through the whole canal without difficulty.

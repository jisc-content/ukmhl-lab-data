ON THE LONG STRICTURE. 109 point to which I shall have occasion again to allude. In endeavouring to ascertain the nature of the case I am considering, an accurate observation of the primary symptoms will afford us some assistance: it is by certain phenomena which occur in the treatment, however, that our knowledge of it is rendered certain. As to the primary symptoms in those cases which I have seen, they have not, in general, been charac- terized by unusual severity; and certainly in none by an intensity proportionate to the dura- tion of the disease; the straining is, however, considerable. If the caustics be applied, little benefit follows their employment, nor any material pain, provided their application be conducted as in ordinary cases. If an instru- ment be passed to a stricture of this kind, which has long existed, the sensation afforded is analogous to that met with in those cases for which I have recommended the argenti nitras ; and probably depends on the same circum- stance, viz. the alteration in the texture of the affected membrane. If an instrument, however, be passed through the contraction, the sensa- tion experienced by the operator is strikingly

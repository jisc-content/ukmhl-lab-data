138 RETENTION OF URINE. instrument would have been necessary. As far as I have seen, the untimely attempt to intro- duce an instrument in severe cases of retention of urine, has not only been uniformly unsuc- cessful, but has very much increased the irri- tation on which the retention depends, and rendered the introduction of an instrument at the proper period, infinitely more difficult, and, in some cases, impossible. I have seen many cases, where no instrument could be intro- duced, relieved by the judicious application of means presently to be mentioned. It is difficult to see any reason for the practice which I have endeavoured to reprobate, since there is no dan- ger in waiting two or three hours, which will be sufficient for the institution of the proper prac- tice. The bladder will contain a large quantity of urine : * it may ascend as high as the umbi- licus, and yet no instrument be necessary for its evacuation. I should not have said so much on the early introduction of the catheter, had I not known that this injudicious practice is stdl pursued by men who are otherwise intelligent • Sabatier has recorded a case in which the bladder contained eighteen pints of lu-ine.—^-ee Medecine Oph-afoire.

206 ON STRICTURE OF THE RECTUM. turn. Another set of causes originate in general repletion. A loaded condition of the circulation frequently oppresses the action of the heart, the pulse is labouring, restricted and feeble, and thus the blood not being freely sent forward, on its arrival at the right side of the heart, the venous system is thrown into a state of congestion, which ultimately affects its pri- mary ramifications. In this way the veins of the rectum become loaded, burst, and form piles, and these, with the plethoric state of the rectum of which they are indicative, produce a degree of irritation very favourable to the occur- rence of stricture. Should there be disease of the liver, at all impeding the circulation in that organ, plethora of the rectum is still more likely to happen, for reasons too obvious to any one who considers how the venae portae is formed, to require particular mention. In this way altera- tions of structure in the thoracic or abdominal viscera may, by the obstruction they afford to the circulation, produce disorder of the rectum. It is a subject of familiar observation, how fre- quently diseases of the chest and rectum are found in the same individual. I examined a

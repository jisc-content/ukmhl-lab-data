ON THE USE OF 102 kali purum, but not with any certainty with the largest proportion generally used, and the exceedingly powerful nature of this caustic renders the employment of a quantity sufficient to produce this effect highly unadvisable. In- deed, the very points of excellence properly attributed to the judicious use of the kali, as recommended by Mr. Whately, become imper- fections. The slough, under these circum- stances, being seldom produced, in consequence of the kali so readily mixing with the mucus of the urethra, and the grease with which it is covered.

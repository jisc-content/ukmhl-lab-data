Even hydrocele very seldom forms (unless in patients who are generally dropsical) without a greater or less uneasiness being felt in the part, and in some cases this is considerable, especially where it is consequent on local injury, under which circumstances the fluid frequently be- comes efl'used with great celerity. It should be recollected also, that aqueous effusion and thickening is a very common result of irritation in the serous membranes generally, of which structure the tunica vaginalis is an example.

But in hoematocele this thickening is much greater, and in some cases so enormous, that excepting from its still more or less smooth interior, no one would recognize it as having been a serous membrane.

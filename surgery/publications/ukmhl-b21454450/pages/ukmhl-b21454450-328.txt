ON THE DIAGNOSIS OF 294 any explanation of such cases, are to my mind satisfactory proofs that he could not have mis- taken them. It should be recollected, that the number is but six in several thousand examr pies of femoral hernise. This case can only happen, I conceive, from some imperfection in the structure of Poupart's ligament. I have seen many patients in whom the strength of support given by Poupart's ligament has been palpably less than is usual. A professional man once sent me a case from Cambridgeshire, in consequence of a very eminent surgeon in London having recommended a truss, the patient having no distinct hernia. When I examined the patient, I found that he had no hernia, but that there was a remarkable feeling of thinness and want of support along the line of Poupart's ligament, with a kind of impulse on coughing, very distinct from any thing which is discoverable in the natural condition of the parts. I forebore to apply a truss, because any thing like pressure, exclusively on the femoral ring, would certainly have increased the pro- bability of rupture elsewhere. I therefore ordered a general support to be given to the

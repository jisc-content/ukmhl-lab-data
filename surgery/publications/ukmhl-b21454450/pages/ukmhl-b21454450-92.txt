In cases where no instrument can be passed through a stricture, by the employment of caustic or other means, it is better to cut down to and divide the stricture, in a manner hereafter to be described. In removing strictures, by intro- ducing instruments of increasing diameter, sur- geons have either employed common wax-cloth bougies, those made of elastic gum, catgut, or the metallic, which last has been called sound or bougie, as it was composed of flexible or unyielding materials. First, then, of the com- mon wax-cloth bougie: this instrument is of little use, except for taking the impression of a stricture,* for which purpose it is well calcu- * It has been recommended to affix a wax cloth point to the end of a firm instrument, in order more effectually to take the imijression of a stricture. I have never found it necessary to adopt this plan, although it appears well calculated for the object in question.â€”Fide Du Camp's Traile des reirecissc'mc?is de I'Urelhrc.

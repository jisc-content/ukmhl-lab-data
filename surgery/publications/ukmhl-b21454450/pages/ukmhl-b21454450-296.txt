The spermatic chord is behind the tumour: having, therefore, the same relation to it as to the hernia, from which it is to be distinguished; the tumour is scarcely ever tender; the patient usually allowing any manipulation which may be thought requisite, without the least complaint. Cases have occurred wherein a large cyst* has formed in the scrotum, but distinct from the tunica vaginalis, and of which there are spe- cimens in the college. Whether the following may be considered as a case of that description, or (what appears to me more probable) an enor- mous specimen of hydrocele of the chord, I cannot determine.â€”A man applied to me with a tumour extending downwards from the abdo- minal ring, and of the size of a cocoa-nut. In appearance it resembled a large hernia, the testicle being readily felt at the bottom of the tumour, perfectly distinct from it. As a careful * Hydated cysts are said to have been found in the course of the spermatic chord. I have no recollection of having seen such a case. The fluid would in this case so much resemble that eflused in hydro- cele in the same situation, as in all probability to render the distinction of the two cases as impossible, as it appears in a practical view, xui- important.

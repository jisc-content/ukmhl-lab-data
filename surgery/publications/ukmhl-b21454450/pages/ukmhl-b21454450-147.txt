ON THE LONG STRICTURE. 113 I conducted; and there are some rules to be observed, which, as they apply to this case in particular, I proceed to describe. It has been observed, that the opening may not be central; and this should make the surgeon particularly cautious when he feels confident that his instru- ment has entered the stricture; for if he attempts to facilitate the progress of the ca- theter by any additional force, should the open- ing be irregular, he will assuredly make a false passage. Therefore, whatever progress the in- strument may be making, no more pressure should be excited than when it first touched what I may term the anterior part of the con- traction. With regard to the intervals between each application of the catheter, they may be regulated as in ordinary cases : the time which the catheter should be allowed to remain, requires consideration. No one would certainly think of keeping an instrument in the urethra, if its presence was productive of much irrita- tion ; but as the benefit derived from each in- troduction is generally proportionate with the length of time that the urethra is capable of enduring the presence of the instrument, no

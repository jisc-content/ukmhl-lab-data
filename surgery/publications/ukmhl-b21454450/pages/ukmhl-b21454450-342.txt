ON THE DIAGNOSIS OF 308 CASES OF TUMOUR IN THE GROIN, ACCOMPANIED BY SYMPTOMS OF STRANGULATED. HERNIA. In the year 1821, I was sent for by Dr. Lidderdale, and Mr. Field, of Wilderness Row, to examine a tumour of the groin in a female, under the following circumstances:â€”The pa- tient had for several days laboured under symp- toms of enteritis, for which the usual remedies had been actively employed without having produced any remission in the symptoms. At this period, it was discovered that she had a tumour in the groin. On examining the patient, I found a moderately firm, smooth, somewhat elastic tumour, occupying the situation of the femoral ring, if I except, that it appeared to be rather nearer the femoral vessels than, as I con- ceived from its size, it ought to be, if hernia. I could also bring it forward, in a trivial degree, with a facility which I was disposed to think would be impracticable with a strangulated femoral rupture. There was a very obscure feeling of central fluidity, but no tenderness: the skin covering the swelling was quite natural.

CHAPTER XIIL ON STRICTURE IN THE FEMALE. Strictures in women are by far less frequent than in men: This comparative infrequency is, I think, very intelligible. Mr. Hunter has very truly observed, that in proportion as an organ has a complexity of function to execute, so is it liable to disease. Now the office performed by the urethra in the female is simple, being con- fined to that of giving exit to the urine from the bladder; whilst that of the male assists in the execution of both the urinary and generative functions. It is thus exposed to a great many additional sources of excitement; and, by its intimate connexion with both sets of organs, its sympathies are proportionably extensive.

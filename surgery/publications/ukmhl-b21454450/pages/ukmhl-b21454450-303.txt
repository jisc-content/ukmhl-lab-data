TUMOURS IN THE GROIN. 2C9 magnitude have occasionally been wounded in tapping hydroceles. I had tapped a large num- ber before I met with a case of this kind: I never saw but two, and these occurred within a week of each other. I shall briefly relate them; premising, that although the spermatic artery might be wounded (where its course had been changed) in tapping hydrocele,' yet, that under certain circumstances, particularly if there were any peculiarity in the puncture, as cutting a small piece out of the side of a vessel, the external pudics might furnish a consider- able haemorrhage. Where hydrocele has ex- isted for some time, and where the integuments have become much distended, the vessels of the scrotum often enlarge to a great degree. This may be seen in the venous trunks, and felt in the arterial, which frequently pulsate with con- siderable power. In consequence of these cir- cumstances, I now never tap a hydrocele, without looking very attentively to the spot on which I propose to puncture, and feeling that there be no artery ramifying in that situation.

15 OF IRRITABLE URETHRA. patients making water in a full stream after a meal, although previous to this it was exceed- ingly small, and the urethra so irritable as to give a feeling of stranguryâ€”a difference which never happens to the same extent in stricture. Involuntary emissions * are occasionally atten- dant on stricture, but they are scarcely to be considered as a common symptom ; whereas in simply irritable urethra nothing can be more frequent: and I am the more confident that this difference exists, from finding that they are sometimes described as a symptom of stricture occurring at an early period of the disease.f Where these are a leading symptom, the irrita- tion is frequently confined to the prostatic portion, but not invariably, as I have seen * I have seen very many cases tending to establish this point. One morning, whilst this treatise was in course of publication, I had occasion to examine the urethra of a patient who consulted me a few days previously for symptoms which rendered him confident that he had stricture. On his informing me, that since he had employed the measures recommended to subdue the irritation, his stream had been on some occasions as large as natural, I recollected that he had not complained of involuntary emissions. On making an inquiry as to this point, he said that he was very frequently troubled with their occurrence. Examination detected a highly sensitive prostatic ure- thra, but no stricture. t Howship on the Urinary Organs.

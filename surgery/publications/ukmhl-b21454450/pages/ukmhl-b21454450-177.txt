For this purpose, the magnitude of the instrument employed should be determined by the volume which the patient describes his stream to have ordinarily been before the attack of retention. As the urethra is always in a highly sensitive and irritable condition, it is essential that the greatest gen- tleness should be observed. With regard to the mode of introducing the catheter, I have little to add to that which has been said before. If, however, after we have arrived at the stric- ture, the instrument be impeded, it should be remembered, that it is of great consequence to pass the point into the stricture, so that the eye of the catheter, as it is termed, be beyond the obstruction. In a case where I was fortunate enough to accomplish this, the puncture of the bladder was certainly prevented ; all the usual remedies had been employed, the symptoms were very severe, and the instruments for open- ing the bladder were in the room ; when, pre- viously to withdrawing the catheter, 1 gave it a

ON THE INTRODUCTION point presses against the arch of the pubes; * the mere recollection of this circumstance is sufficient to enable the surgeon to avoid such an obstacle. Instruments of considerable size often meet an impediment in the pouch formed by the verumontanum, which in general will admit a bougie (of No. 6). This I have seen the source of much embarrassment where the operator did not immediately recollect the anatomy of the parts; and as it consti- tutes an obstruction where stricture is never found, it cannot be too strongly impressed on the mind of the student. To avoid this obstacle, the operator should raise both the instrument and penis towards the abdomen, and keeping the point of the former to the upper surface of the canal, should depress them together. The consideration of en- larged prostate may appear foreign to the object of this treatise, yet in connexion with the introduction of instruments it is necessary to mention it, as well as the means by which the impediment it offers is to be avoided. This * Perhaps it would be more correct to say, against the triangular ligament of Camper.

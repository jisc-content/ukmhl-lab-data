10 OF STRICTURES OF THE URETHRA. Strictures occurred as frequently after gonor- rhoea treated without injections as with them; I could readily believe much more frequently, and for the following reason. Diligent investigation shows that stricture does not commonly proceed from violent inflam- mation, but from a sort of irritation, moderate but continued, principally characterized by a morbid increase of sensibility, sometimes at- tended by discharge. Thus it is found that where stricture can be traced to gonorrhoea, the latter has been neglected, and the irritation, of which the discharge is sufficient evidence, unnecessarily protracted; during which period the patient is liable to sources of excitement which he is wearied with foregoing. No state can be more favourable to the formation of stric- ture than that to which I have just referred. Injections, therefore, when properly employed, by removing the irritation and discharge, so far from conducing to the occurrence of stricture, become actually indirect preventives of this disease. The consideration of gonorrhoea, would lead to a digression; I shall therefore merely mention the principles to which it is necessary

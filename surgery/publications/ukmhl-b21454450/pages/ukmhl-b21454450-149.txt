ON THE LONG STRICTURE. 115 The catheter, however, need not be retained more than twenty-four hours, as no particular advantage is derived from leaving it permanently in; and we certainly run the risk of increasing irritation, besides rendering the treatment much more painful. In France, strictures are very generally treated by leaving an elastic catheter constantly in the bladder; and, in those cases which I saw, the patients were confined to their beds. But I should not be disposed to follow the examples of the French surgeons, in this particular ; first, for the reason above stated, with reference to the increase of suflfering; and, secondly, because it is quite unnecessary. The next point, in connexion with the treat- ment of the long and old stricture, is, the greater or less rapidity with which the size of the catheter should be increased. This cannot be accomplished in too gradual a manner; for, although the stricture will often admit a size larger than the last employed, I have found that it is not always expedient to employ it. This observation, however, refers especially to that period of the case when we are using the larger sizes; I mean, from about No. 8 onwards. 1 2

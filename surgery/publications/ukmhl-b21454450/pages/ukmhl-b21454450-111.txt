77 OF ORDINARY CASES. especially to that which is nearest to the bladder. If the canal be exceedingly small at the seat of stricture, the silver catheter is to be pre- ferred to the elastic gum bougie, for we have no control over the point of a small instrument of the latter description. I cannot too strongly recommend the greatest care in the use of the small silver catheter, since it is especially cal- culated to do mischief, if more force be used than is sufficient to keep it fairly in contact with the obstacle. Where, indeed, the opening- through the stricture is sufficiently large to allow of our employing an elastic gum instru- ment, there is considerable advantage in re- sorting to the silver catheter at the latter period of the case, for reasons which have been before mentioned in relation to irritable urethra.* When the catheter or other instrument has been passed into the bladder, it is right to leave it there for a few seconds only at first. Indeed, on this point, the same observations apply as * I liave seldom, of late, employed the elastic gum instrament, after I liad once introduced the silver catheter. But, to some students, who have not had much experience in passing firm instru- ments, the elastic gum (until the canal has been somewhat enlarged) may be recommended as preferable.

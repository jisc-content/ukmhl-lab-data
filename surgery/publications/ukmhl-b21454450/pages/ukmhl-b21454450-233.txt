CASES. 199 doubt that this stricture is one where the ure- thra is for some space continuously contracted, and that the mucous membrane has undergone a considerable change of structure. When these cases were first published, I could have added many others, proving the facts which they are intended to illustrate. Since that period my opportunities of so doing have been further multiplied. 1 have not thought it right, however, to enlarge the book by an additional number of examples. For, whilst one case, in connexion with the facts it is meant to establish, answers all the purposes of practical illustration, the publication of many to illustrate one point, is not only of doubtful utility, but in the minds of some indi- viduals might render the motives questionable.

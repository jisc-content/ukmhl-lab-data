TUMOURS IN THE GROIN. ^o/ present to the hand of the examiner precisely the same characters. As the most important point in the diagnosis, I shall first mention that recommended by Sir Astley Cooper, viz. place the patient in a re- cumbent posture, and reduce the swelling (if this has not been already effected, by the change of position), then make steady pressure by two or more fingers on the ring to prevent its return. The patient should now be directed to rise; the pressure, of course, being continued. If it be hernia, the tumour will not re-appear: if, on the contrary, it be varicocele, the swelling will instantly be re-produced, the pressure of the hand contributing thereto, by obstructing the return of the blood through the enlarged veins. In order to render this mode of diagnosis clear, I shall subjoin a few observations on certain conditions of the inguinal ring, the recollection of which may possibly prevent what might appear to be a failure in the diagnosis. Some inguinal hernise are exceedingly difficult to be retained in their situation when reduced, and this is generally attributed either to the large size of the hernia, or that of the aperture

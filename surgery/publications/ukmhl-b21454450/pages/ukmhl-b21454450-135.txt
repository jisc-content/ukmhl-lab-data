THE AllGENTI NITRAS. 101 the kali purum. Opportunities of examining strictured urethrae, with the previous symptoms of which we are well acquainted, but rarely- present themselves, and this constitutes a diffi- culty inseparable from any attempt at the per- fect elucidation of their pathology. I have never examined the urethra of a patient whom I had previously known to be afflicted with this kind of stricture; but I suspect that the mucous membrane of the urethra becomes unusually changed in structure. If this stricture be treated by the introduction of instruments of increasing sizes, it can be dilated slowly with impunity to a certain point, until perhaps it admits No. 8 or 9; but the instant that the in- troduction of a larger is attempted, there is a sort of re-action in the stricture, evinced by a fit of irritation, rendering all the symptoms in- tensely severe, attended by a remarkable alter- ation in its character as to sensibility.

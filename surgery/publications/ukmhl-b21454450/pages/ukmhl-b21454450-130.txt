9G ON THE USE OF variety of the disease to which Mr. Stanley alludes, any attempt to introduce more than a very moderate sized instrument, only aggravates the patient's sufferings; nor does the difficulty diminish, however frequently the use of the same instrument be repeated. The following case, I subjoin in this place, because it shews, first, that the acute sensibility of which I have spoken, is not essentially con- nected with a haemorrhagic disposition in the stricture; and secondly, that the latter symp- tom, when occurring singly, is nevertheless susceptible of relief by the same measures. A gentleman, about forty years of age, applied to me, and gave the following account of his case: â€”that he had for some time suffered with a stricture of the urethra, for which he had been under the care of eminent surgeons; but that nothing but a small instrument could be introduced, in consequence of the bleeding always excited by any attempts at passing one even of moderate diameter. He had been ad- vised to remain as he was, aad to have a bougie used occasionally, to prevent the canal be- coming still more diminished in its calibre.

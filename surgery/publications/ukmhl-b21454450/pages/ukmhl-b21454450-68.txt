34 ON THE IN'TRODUCTION expedient suggested by Mr. Hey, however, often succeeds where every thing else fails; it consists in nothing more than withdrawing the stilette to the extent of about two inches, and then gently urging on the catheter. The effect this produces is to raise the point of the instru- ment very considerably, and thus allow it to pass over the projection. It is here especially requisite that the stilette should fit the catheter, as the curve formed by its partial removal is then much increased. I cannot conclude this section without strongly inculcating the neces- sity of avoiding undue force under any circum- stances. It is inconceivable how small a degree of force is capable of rupturing the membrane of the urethra. Many preparations, in this metropolis, present lasting and melancholy memorials of the unskilfulness of surgeons on this point. In some specimens which I have seen, there are false passages of various lengths and directions; and, in one instance, I have seen a passage made directly through nearly the whole length of the left corpus cavernosum. The caution here indicated, applies with addi- tional force to the employment of metallic or

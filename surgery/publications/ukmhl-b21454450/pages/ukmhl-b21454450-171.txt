RETENTION OF URINE. 137 does not result from the absolute closure * of the canal by the increase of the stricture, but from the irritation and spasm by which it is affected. What then can be more irrational than the immediate attempt to introduce an instrument, which is never accomplished even in health, without the production of more or less of these consequences ? But, it may be asked, do the results of practice accord with the suggestions of reason on this point? I should confidently answer in the affirmative. Every one knows, that a practised hand may, in some cases, at once succeed in drawing off the urine; but, in the majority of these cases, I verily believe, that had the proper measures been employed, no Â» I had occasion once to punctiu-e the bladder in a man aged seventy-three, whom I did not see until four days had elapsed with- out a drop of urine having passed from him. He was in the last stage of exhaustion. The bladder was felt extending even above the umbilicus, and no instrument could be passed to a greater distance than about three inches. Tlie evacuation of a very large quantity of highly offensive and turbid urine was productive of temporary relief; but he gradually sunk, and in about twenty-four hours died. In ad- dition to a much thickened bladder, enlargement of the third lobe, and an abscess in one lateral lobe of the prostate, I found a body about the size of a large pea close to the enlarged third lobe. I could by no means pas^ any instrument through the strictured portion. The canal seemed absolutely closed for about the third of an inch.

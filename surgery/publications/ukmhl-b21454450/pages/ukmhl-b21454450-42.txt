Â« OF STRICTURES OF THE URETHRA. from this idiosyncrasy, independent of the in- tervention of local excitement, for reasons which obviously present themselves on considering the functions of the generative organs. As no part of the body is exempt from the influence of ge- neral constitutional disorder, so may the urethra become the seat of its local development. In the present state of science it is not necessary to enforce the truth of this proposition by any laboured reasoning. The effects frequently produced by stimulating or other substances taken into the stomach on the urethra, in per- sons who have stricture, as well as in those who have not, are objects of familiar observation. The least deviation from their ordinary mode of living will, in some individuals, induce irrita- tion in the urethra or bladder, where there is no evidence of disease in these organs.

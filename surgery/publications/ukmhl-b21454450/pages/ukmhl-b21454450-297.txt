TUMOURS IN THE GROIN. 263 examination detected none of the characters of hernia, I punctured it with a trocar, and eva- cuated a large quantity of fluid, having the obvious properties of the ordinary water of hydrocele. Cases have occurred of fluid within the sper- matic chord, communicating with the cavity of the abdomen, in consequence of a failure in the natural process, by which the peritoneal canal connected with the descent of the testicle usually becomes closed. I have seen cases of this description, nor do I consider the diagnosis from hernia difficult. It is not, however, easy to describe the diff'erence they present on examina- tion to the finger. The cases which I have seen, have occurred in young subjects; the tumour yields an impulse on coughing, and easily retires, but still feels very unlike hernia. There is no gurgling on its reduction ; it imparts a decided feeling of fluctuation, quite difl'erent from any thing discoverable in a hernia, and the coverings of the tumour feel very much thinner than in any specimen of rupture which has ever oc- currred to my observation.

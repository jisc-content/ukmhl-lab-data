296 ON THE DIAGNOSIS OF a State approaching thereto. The possibility of a hernia assuming this appearance, and thus simulating diseases for which it can seldom be mistaken, should not be forgotten.* In the reduction of femoral hernia, the patient should be placed in a half-recumbent position, the thigh should be bent on the pelvis, and carried towards the middle line of the body. If the hernia have risen above the line of Poupart's ligament, it should be first drawn downwards from this situation. Pressure should now be made by the points of two or three fingers, in a direction upwards and inwards. If the hernia do not readily recede, the fingers should be made to traverse the tumour in a circular manner, as it were, rolling the hernia beneath them; this plan will often succeed when the continuance of steady pressure has failed. I here wish to give a caution; viz., that the surgeon do not press the hernia into the hollow of the thigh, and thus persuade himself that he has reduced it, when in fact he has not done so. * I recollect a case of this kind was once sent into St. Bartho- lomew's Hospital, in which, previous to its admission, a practitioner had applied a poultice.

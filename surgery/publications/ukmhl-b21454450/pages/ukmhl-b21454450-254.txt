Sometimes the stricture may be felt by the finger, and if its whole length can be judged of, and the accompanying symptoms are fairly explained by the degree of obstruc- tion which it offers, its division may be safely performed, and the patient happily relieved in a much shorter time than by any other method.

It should be introduced lying flat on the finger, against which it should be firmly pressed; this will avoid the risk of its injuring any parts inferior to the stricture. When the finger has reached the contraction, the edge of the bistoury should be turned towards' the side on which we propose to divide, the instrument

4 OF STRICTURES OF THE URETHRA. inferiorly, or laterally. In general, the narrow- ing is limited to a line or two in length; but in some cases it extends much farther, the canal having a continuous diminution in its calibre for an inch or more : and again, there are in- stances in which the whole tube, from its membranous portion forwards, has become les- sened in its diameter. Sometimes there is a sort of bridle thrown across the urethra; and the impression, in a case of this kind, which is made on a soft bougie, resembles that M'hich would be produced by drawing a piece of fine twine across its point. I have met with several cases of this kind; and if it be not frequently observed in dissection, I should be disposed to account for it by the appearance being, in all probability, destroyed in slitting open the ure- thra. It does not appear, however, to have escaped the observation of the accurate Mor- gagni, who speaks* of having found "fibras" and " carneas fibrillas" in the urethra. The change which the mucous membrane un- 'dergoes consists of a greater or less thickening. â€¢ Vide Lib. xlii. Sec. 41, et seq.

BY INCISION. 127 own words, premising that he proceeds differ- ently according as he has to divide an imper- meable stricture, or one which yet admits an instrument of small calibre. " Before using the instruments, the exact distance of the stric- ture from the extremity of the urethra should be ascertained. In the armed catheter, which is intended to divide strictures, over the wire which serves as a guide, the wire must be in- troduced through the stricture first. The mode of accomplishing this is by passing the smallest possible sized catheter, made to contain the wire, into the bladder. The wire, which is double the length of the catheter, and blunted at one end, so that it may not injure the bladder, is then pushed forward, and the catheter gradually withdrawn, by which the former is left in the canal of the urethra. The armed catheter is then passed over the wire until its point rests against the stricture, (which is known by means of the graduation,) and being held securely in such position, the handle of the stilette is pressed gently and gradually. As soon as any impression is made, ^ the lancets should be al- lowed to retire into their sheaths, and the blunt

222 ON STRICTURE OF THE RECTUM. abscess, &c., so may these diseases be produc- tive of symptoms simulative of those charac- terizing contraction of the bowel. This was not my intention. 1 cannot, however, quit the subject without mentioning the irritable sphinc- ter, the symptoms of which so much resemble those of stricture. I believe it to depend on irritation in the bowel. The sphincter in this case resists the introduction of the finger with considerable power, and the irritation in the bowel frequently gives rise to painful efforts to eject the finger or bougie when brought in con- tact with it. The case may be known by the op- position afforded by the sphincter, and by the rectum being free from contraction. Attention to the general health, mild and spare diet, with regulation of the bowels, including the use of enemata, are in general successful. Where these measures fail, the passage of a bougie a few times may be added with advan- tage. I recollect no case in which their com- bined influence has failed in removing this affection.

255 TUMOURS IN THE GROIN. CASE PRESENTING THE ORDINARY CHARACTERS OF EASILY REDUCIBLE INGUINAL HERNIA, ACCOM- PANIED BY STRANGULATION AT THE INTERNAL RING. I was sent for by a gentleman to see his servant, who gave me the following account:â€” That he had a rupture, and that finding himself unwell, he had sent for a surgeon, who had examined the tumour, and left him, saying, that " the rupture had gone up." Not finding his symptoms relieved, he had sent for me. I found him walking about the house, and endeavouring to follow his employment. On examining the abdominal ring, I found a small inguinal hernia, which readily receded on pressure; but as he had all the symptoms of strangulation in a well marked degree, I examined him more particu- larly, and on thrusting the point of my finger into the ring, distinctly felt that the intestine only receded within this external opening of the inguinal canal, beyond which I could not reduce it by position or otherwise. I ordered him to bed, and immediately instituted the usual measures for the reduction of strangulated hernia; all these were employed without effect.

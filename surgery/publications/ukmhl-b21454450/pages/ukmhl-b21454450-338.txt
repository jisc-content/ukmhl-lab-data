ON THE DIAGNOSIS OJ 304 OMENTAL FEMORAL HERNIA. I have already spoken of the inguinal form of omental hernia, and the points which require to be added in connexion with the femoral omental hernia, consist chiefly of those which distinguish it from the inguinal. Of these, the situation at the femoral ring is the most strik- ing ; it is usually much smaller in size, and of a more rounded form. From its situation, it does not admit of the same freedom of manipulation as is always practicable with a hernia occurring at the inguinal aperture, and thus the slippery feel cognizable in the inguinal species, cannot be recognized in the femoral. It may, of course, be reducible or irreducible, and, so far, may be moveable from without inwards, but the hernia admits of no lateral motion, or, if any, it is very restricted, for reasons which are readily suggested on considering the small aperture through which it has been protruded, and the nature of the superjacent parts. If it be adherent, or otherwise irreducible, the tumour has considerable firmness, and its surface,

In hydrocele of the tunica vagi- nalis, these fibre-like productions of which I have spoken, in. connexion with hydrocele of the chord, are very palpable; and, although they are not equally so in all cases, they may be invariably felt on exerting a little pressure supe- riorly, so as to tighten the integuments cover- ing the tumour, and thus making the hydrocele, as it were, descend to the bottom of the scro- tum. Whether these fibrous productions are formed by elongated and thickened cellular tissue, or by partial separation of the vessels of the chord, I will not attempt to determine; perhaps both may contribute occasionally.

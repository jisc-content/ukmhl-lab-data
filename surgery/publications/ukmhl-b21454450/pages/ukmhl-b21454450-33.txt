REVIEWS OF THE FIRST EDITION OF STRICTURE OF THE URETHRA. In concluding this very short notice of Mr. Macilwain's little work, we have no hesitation in averring that it is the most judicious, concise, and ably written treatise on the subject which we have perused ; and that it is most admirably adapted for putting the student and junior practitioner in possession of all the valuable information which has been accumulated on the subject of stricture.—Medico Chirurgical Review. July, 1827, Macilwain's Treatise on Strictures.—A complete work like this was much wanted, to condense into one volume the multiform doctrines and practice of the various writers on strictures; all of whom only detail their own views, and pass by others as quite worthless. The author, however, is far from being a mere compiler; he reasons well, and is often original. We shall review the work in our next Number.— Foreign Quarterly. April, 1824. See also the succeeding Number, For further commendatory remarks on this work.— Vide Cooper's Surgical Dictionary, last Edition, and Lancet. May, 1826, 8fc. Sfc.

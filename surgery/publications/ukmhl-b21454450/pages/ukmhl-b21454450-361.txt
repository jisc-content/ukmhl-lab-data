All operations are easily performed, when the surgeon is prepared for all the dif- ficulties from which many of them are in- separable ; but if any source of embarrassment occur unexpectedly, 1 need scarcely say, how soon a man of good nerve, and otherwise correct knowledge, may be baffled and confused. For these reasons, I shall mention those circum- stances in which tracheotomy in a dead body, and in a person labouring under disease of the larynx, chiefly differs.

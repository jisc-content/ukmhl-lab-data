ON THE DIAGNOSIS OF 270 CASES OF HYDROCELE OF WHICH THE PUNCTURE WAS FOLLOWED BY HAEMORRHAGE. In the spring of 1822, I tapped a hydrocele in a man who was between sixty and seventy years of age, and drew off a full pint of the ordinary fluid of hydrocele. A drop or two of blood followed the removal of the canula, as is usual. The next day he applied to me, with the tumour nearly as large as it had been before the puncture; the surface of it appearing of a livid blue colour, blood being effused under the skin covering it, as high up as the root of the penis, and extending laterally nearly to the groins. On examination, the general mass did not feel tense, much less did the cellular tissue appear so, which connects the scrotum with the tunica vaginalis. Entertaining hopes that the tumour formed by the comparatively distended tunic might result from aqueous fluid recently effused, and that the blood evidently in the cel- lular tissue of the scrotum might become ab- sorbed, I ordered him to bed, and prescribed some aperient medicine. In two days the dark colour of the tumour had nearly disappeared.

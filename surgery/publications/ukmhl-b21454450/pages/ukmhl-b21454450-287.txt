TUMOURS IN THE GROIN. ^Oii times attends this form of hernia, but not so frequently as other varieties of the complaint. The spermatic chord is felt distinctly behind the tumour,* if the latter be sufficiently large to have extended along this process, which may be always recognized by the peculiarly resisting fibrous-like feel, characterizing the vas deferens. I know of no disease which can be mistaken for the foregoing variety of hernia, excepting a chronic abscess, presenting at the abdominal ring. The presence of palpable fluctuation, and the absence of the characters of hernia, would no doubt generally render the distinc- tion easy.

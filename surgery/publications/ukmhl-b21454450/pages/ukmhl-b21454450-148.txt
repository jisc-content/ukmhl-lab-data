114 ON THE LONG STRICTURE. means should be neglected which have ever so remote a tendency to preserve a tranquil state of the canal. Besides employing the usual measures for that purpose, I would re- commend the surgeon to introduce the instru- ment while the patient is in bed; and if he be suffered to rise, walking should be prohibited, and, indeed, all kinds of exertion, horse-exercise more particularly : for none is more prejudicial in stricture than this, for reasons sufficiently obvious. The period during which the instru- ment can be retained, varies ; sometimes I have left it in several hours, and even a day and night, with impunity, and great benefit has followed ; at other times, notwithstanding that the irritation excited was not considerable, I have regretted that I did not withdraw it in a few minutes. In truth, it is often a matter of experiment, since the degree of irritation at the time is not always precisely indicative of that which is to follow. The best general direction that can be given is, to allow the instrument to remain longer at each succeeding application; and to direct the patient to withdraw it the instant that he feels any particular uneasiness.

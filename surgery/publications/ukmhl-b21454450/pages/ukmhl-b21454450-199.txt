STIIICTURE IN THE FEMALE. 105 had it excited any particular irritation; but I am convinced that this was referable to other causes. I may here observe, that I should not have repeated the instrument so often but in consideration of the comparative small degree of sensibility which exists in the female urethra. The following day I found her quite comfort- able, and advised her to avoid all sources of excitement, particularly that on which I con- ceived the present attack of irritation to depend. From this period the case went on favourably; the stream of urine gradually acquired its usual volume, and the frequency of micturition no longer existed; the size of the catheter was in- creased every second or third day, until a full- sized instrument entered the bladder with faci- lity, when she felt herself perfectly well. This is now more than a year since, and I understand she has had no return of the complaint.

ON THE LONG STRICTURE. 110 different from that which he feels when passing it through an ordinary stricture; for, as it pro- ceeds, we do not find that it moves more or less freely, as is usually the case, but that its pro- gress is continued through a space that admits it with difficulty.* Now this certainly hap- pens at first with some other cases, because the same sensation may be produced by an irritable stricture, contracting strongly on an instrument, and thus rendering its further progress difficult. Here, however, the difficulty diminishes with each succeeding introduction, whereas in the case to which this chapter refers, the resistance is continued; and however you may increase the size of the instrument, although the degree of resistance varies as the canal approximates to its natural calibre, the sensation experienced is analogous. The difficulty in withdrawing the catheter is also a striking feature in the old and long stricture; in other cases, where this difficulty occurs, we feel a sort of jerk when â€¢ In some respects, it will be seen that these cases resemble those met with by Mr. Stanley; but in the latter, the impediment seems wholly to result from the intractable irritation which is superadded, which is not the case in tiiose~ examples of stricture which are here considered.

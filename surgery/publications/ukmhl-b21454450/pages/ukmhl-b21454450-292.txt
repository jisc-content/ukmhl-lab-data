258 ON THE DIAGNOSIS OF have fallen under my observation, has there been any external tumour; although, occa- sionally, slight fullness over the inguinal canal has been observed. OF INGUINAL HERNIA, WHICH REQUIRE MORE OR LESS MANIPULATION TO EFFECT THEIR REDUCTION.* The form and size are variable; the tumour generally extends to a greater or less degree down the course of the spermatic chord. The pressure exerted by the ring, gives the sv^relling considerable firmness and elasticity. There is impulse on coughing, and not unfrequently a slight gurgling perceptible by the finger of the examiner. Inquiry will generally elicit that its occurrence was sudden, and that it has subsequently become somewhat larger. In most cases there is greater or less accompany- ing disorder of the bowels, and occasionally some little tenderness on pressure. • The necessity for this division may he questioned—hut as the external characters are different from the preceding variety, and as this form may be confounded with diseases for which it is impossible to mistake a hernia which recedes on slight pressure, or in the re- cumbent position, I have thought it best to adopt the distinction.

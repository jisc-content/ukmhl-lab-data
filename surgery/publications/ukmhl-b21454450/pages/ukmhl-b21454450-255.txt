ON STRICTURE OF THE RECTUM. 221 being kept steady by the finger on which it has been introduced. As the hsemorrhoidal vessels frequently become enlarged under circum- stances of continued irritation, it is better to divide the stricture by two or three very small incisions in different directions, than to accom- plish its division in one. If the latter mode were preferred, a sacro-lateral direction would probably be the most safe; but as the practice above recommended will always effect the de- sired object, it should be preferred. As soon as the aperture be sufficiently enlarged to freely admit the finger, the case may then be treated by the bougie in the ordinary manner. I can con- fidently assert that this practice, adopted under favourable circumstances, has been productive of great and much accelerated relief, and that too in cases, in which, before the division of the stricture, bougies had made little or no impres- sion. My friend, Mr. Kingdon, has also treated strictures of the rectum in this way with good success. Were it my object to speak of dis- eases of the rectum generally, I should have to shew, that as the irritation in the rectum which precedes stricture is attendant on piles, fistulee.

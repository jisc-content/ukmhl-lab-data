lob OF ABSCESSES AND FISTULA meets with the least resistance, I believe that occasionally it may be better to allow the instrument to remain until the stricture has been in a degree removed. The cases to which I allude, are those in which the smallest instru- ment is passed with difficulty; and in these, the escape of the urine through the ulcerated aperture will be certainly rendered less pro- bable by its always having a ready outlet by the catheter. As soon as the urethra, however, is rendered capable of admitting even a mode- rate sized instrument, I should certainly not allow it to remain, as I am convinced that the irritation it produces, is unfavourable to the healing either of the urethra or the fistula. As to the rapidity with which the size of the catheter should be increased whilst any is al- lowed to remain in the canal, it will vary with the kind and degree of stricture. The facility, however, with which this may be accomplished, and consequently the period at which it may be proper, will usually be indicated by a small quantity of urine escaping by the side at the same time that it is passing through the tube of the instrument.

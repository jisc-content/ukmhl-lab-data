26 ON THE -INTRODUCTION catheter were thinner in some parts than in others: if, however, the instrument be well made, it seems somewhat inexplicable, since the urethra is not capable of making the least impression on instruments of this composition. Gum catheters are generally sold in the shops, with the stilettes so small as to be scarcely of any use, which is worse than having none at all; since, in the latter case, the conviction that we cannot control the direction of the point, prevents us from using any force capable of doing mischief. As the course of the urethra is curved, such should be the curve of the in- strument. The degree of curvature in common bougies, or even in those of elastic gum with wire is not very material, since neither instru- ment is absolutely unyielding, the last two inches being of most consequence, where it should be moderately bent. In metallic instru- ments it is more particularly desirable, how- ever, that the curve should correspond to that of the urethra. The form which is gene- rally given to them approximates more or less to that recommended by Dessault, forming the segment of a circle six inches in diameter; or

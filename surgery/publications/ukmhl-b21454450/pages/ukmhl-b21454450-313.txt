TUMOURS IN THE GROIN. 279 afforded by the testicle beneath them. If, in grasping the integuments superiorly to the tumour, the surgeon use sufficient force to render the integuments quite tense, he may ascertain the presence of fluid, but will never be able to even guess at the degree of the en- largement of the testicle. After the examina- tion, the fluid may be safely withdrawn (if thought necessary), provided a fine trocar be cautiously introduced, with the finger within about half an inch from its point, to regulate the depth of the puncture, when the kind or degree of the enlargement of the gland may be accurately ascertained.

Jalap and calomel, the latter with colocynth and soap, or castor oil, will generally answer this intention suf- ficiently well: I have usually preferred the jalap and calomel; it is quicker than the colo- cynth, and less nauseous than the castor oil.

It has another recommendation, viz. that medicines which usually give pain may, in this way, be

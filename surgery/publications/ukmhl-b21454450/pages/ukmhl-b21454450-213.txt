Or- dered eight leeches to the perineum, with the continuance of the other measures, and absolute rest enjoined. 15^^.—The attack of irritation had quite sub- sided, and the instrument the next in the scale introduced without difficulty.

No further interruption occurred in the progressive intro- duction of the larger catheters. No. 14 was introduced thrice, and the patient discharged, perfectly well. N 2

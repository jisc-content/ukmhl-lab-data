In such cases the gland may be placed laterally with respect to the hernia, and if so, will be usually found on its outer side.* There is impulse on coughing, and a palpable gargouillement on handling; if the hernia be reducible with difficulty, it is most frequently the result of a loaded condition of the protruded bowel, and in this case it has a considerable degree of elasticity. The history of the case will shew that the disease com- menced at its upper part, and that its bulk has gradually increased from above downwards. In almost every case of hernia arrived at this size, the patient has already been made ac- quainted with its real nature; for it is seldom that hernia is mistaken for hydrocele, or dis- eases of the testis, but these have too often been mistaken for hernia. * A case may occur in which the testicle not having descended into the scrotum, may present at the ring alone, or combined with hernia. The case is easily distinguished by the firmness which cha- racterizes the testicle, by the peculiar and painful sensation excited when pressure is made on it, and by its absence from the correspond- ing side of the scrotum.

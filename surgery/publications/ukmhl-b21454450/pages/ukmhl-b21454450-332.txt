39.8 ON THE DIAGNOSIS, OF an incautious examiner, be mistaken for the inguinal variety. The distinction is important, because it cannot be returned, however redu- cible, unless it be pushed downwards before any pressure is made in the direction of the femoral ring for its reduction. Without this previous step, the only result of any effort to reduce it, would be to press it more closely against Poupart's ligament, on vv^hich it lies."^ If the history of the case be insufficient to explain its nature, the introduction of the fore- finger into the inguinal ring w^ill readily detect it by shewing that the hernia has not been pro- truded through that aperture. Should the pa- tient be a female, this circumstance alone will be sufficient to excite a suspicion that the hernia is femoral, thus simulating the inguinal form of the disease. It sometimes happens, that a patient has an inguinal and femoral rup- ture on the same side of the body. Here the diagnosis is somewhat different, but I think in general, not difficult; for the reduction of either, and pressure on its corresponding aper- ture, whilst the patient is directed to make ex- * Vide Sir Astley Cooper's Work.

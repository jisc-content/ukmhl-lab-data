64 ON THE TREATMENT OF STRICTURES. always, however, using an instrument, the point of which is too large to enter the stricture. As the above directions do not inform us of the definite size of the piece of caustic employed, I may add that I have seldom used a portion greater than the head of the largest sized pin. Another mode of using the argenti nitras has been suggested by Mr. Whately, which consists in making a sort of paste with mucilage, and moulding it round the extremity of the bougie. As I do not see the particular advantage attend- ing this mode, I have never adopted it; that the caustic may, in this way, come in contact with other parts besides the stricture, is suf- ficiently obvious.

The security in its use arises from the minuteness of the portion employed, and from its being readily miscible with oily and mucilaginous matters. There has been a great deal of speculation concerning the precise

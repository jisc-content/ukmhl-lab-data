ON THE TREATMENT OF STRICTURES. 63 substance of the bougie. This should be done some little time before it is used, for the ma- terials of which the bougie is composed become warm and soft by being handled in inserting the caustic ; and therefore, the hold the bougie has of the caustic, is rendered more secure after it has been allowed to cool and harden. This bougie, so prepared, is to be oiled and made ready for use; but previous to passing it, a common bougie of the same size is to be intro- duced down to the stricture, to clear the canal, and to measure exactly the distance of the stricture from the external orifice. This dis- tance being marked on the armed bougie, it is to be passed down the stricture immediately upon the other being withdrawn." Cases having occurred, however, in which the caustic had escaped from the bougie. Sir Everard, I believe, afterwards preferred using an instru- ment into which a small cylindrical portion of caustic had been introduced at the time the bougie was manufactured. I have, however, always employed the first mode when ever I have had occasion to use the argenti nitras, and have never met with any accident of this kindâ€”

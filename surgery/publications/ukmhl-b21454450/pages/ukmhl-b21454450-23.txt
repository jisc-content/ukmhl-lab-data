EXPLANATION OF THE PLATE. Fig. 1.—Represents very exactly the curve formed by the Urethra, in a preparation of enlarged Prostate in the possession of Mr. Stanley. Fig. 2.—Represents the size of the smallest Catheter I ever introduce. It is made conical towards the handle to increase its strength, which otherwise (as the instrument is a tube) would be so inconsiderable as to endanger its breaking. This is No. ] in the scale of sizes. Fig. 3.—Is intended to represent the diameter of the largest Catheter I usually employ in the treatment of Stric- ture. It scarcely gives a correct idea, however, of the full size of the instrument. Both Fig. 2 and 3 repre- sent also the precise form of the curved portion of the instrument. t^iG. 4.—Length and size of the tube to be used after the operation of Tracheotomy. I can confidently state that the Surgeon will be embarrassed if he employ any which is shorter. Those which are much curved, and of sufficient length to occupy a portion of the Trachea, which is beyond the opening made in it, are calculated to increase irritation. t^iG. 5.—Front view of the same.

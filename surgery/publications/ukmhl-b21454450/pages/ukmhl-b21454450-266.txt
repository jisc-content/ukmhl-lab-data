Mental agitation proceeding from any other cause will excite a paroxysm. In this way, not only at times when it is desirable to take food, but generally, the patient is kept in a greater or less state of agitation and alarm, and there is some- times considerable pain described as shooting towards the back. This, with the small quan- tity of food usually taken, is productive of con- siderable emaciation; the countenance assumes an habitual expression of anxiety, and the whole condition of the patient is truly deplor- able. If the case be unrelieved, or if it be of a specific character, the patient sinks under the continued irritation which these circumstances, combined with imperfect nutrition, create and maintain.

There is a case in St. Bar- tholomew's, where the lower end of the oeso- phagus and a portion of the cardiac orifice of the stomach are thus entirely destroyed.

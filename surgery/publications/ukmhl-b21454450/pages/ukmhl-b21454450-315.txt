TUMOURS IN THE GROIN. 281 by which it is so often accompanied, I feel confident that an accurate examination will either discover the real nature of the affection, or at least lead to such a suspicion of it, as to cau- tion the surgeon from cominitting such a mis- take. It is true, that in fungoid disease, there is often a very deceptive sensation imparted to the touch of deeply-seated fluid; but the sur- face of the tumour scarcely ever gives the idea of uniform density; on the contrary, it is very firm in some parts, whilst it presents this feeling of a deeply-seated fluid in others. In many instances, also, the tumour affords the idea of a lobulated structure. Were the nature of such a case ascertainable, it would of course be desira- ble not to puncture it; yet, should the surgeon happen to do so, and the caution were observed, which has been recommended with reference to hydro-sarcocele, it is very probable that little or no mischief might be occasioned by the operation.

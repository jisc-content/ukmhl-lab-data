CASES. 196 used,^ until No. 3 could be introduced into the bladder: in order to accomplish this, it was necessary not to repeat any attempt after a shorter interval than six days, and also to re- peat the introduction of one instrument twice or thrice before the introduction of one of larger diameter became necessary. The argenti nitras and kali purum were both repeatedly employed, in order to facilitate the progress of the case, but without advantage. The plan of simple di- latation was therefore alone trusted to, until No. 7 could be passed into the bladder: at this time the caustics were again employed, but again failed in producing any good effect. Up to this period the facility of micturition increased in proportion to the increasing size of the instru- ment employed. On introducing No. 8, the difficulty in making water returned, and twelve days elapsed before any instrument could again be introduced; and then it was two or three sizes less than that employed at the last visit. Notwithstanding these difficulties, the plan was persevered in until No. 11 was passed into the bladder. Finding, however, at this period, that the introduction of large instruments inva-

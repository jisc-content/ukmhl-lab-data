264 ON THE DIAGNOSIS OF SCROTAL HERNIA. As an inguinal hernia increases in magnitude, and extends downwards towards the testicle, it usually receives the appellation of scrotal, and becomes liable to be confounded with other diseases. Some of these are not unfre- quently found in conjunction with hernia. The scrotal hernia is more or less pyriform; the little pressure exerted by the enlarged abdo- minal ring, together with the readily yielding- cellular tissue of the scrotum, produce consi- derable difference in the elasticity of the swell- ing, which in easily reducible cases is very trivial. The spermatic chord is (with the rare iexceptions already mentioned), felt distinctly behind the hernia, and however large it may be, the testicle may be easily distinguished at the inferior extremity of the tumour. If the hernia be cogenital, the testicle may not be so readily perceived, as it may then be in contact with the hernia, but a very little careful examination will detect it. In very large specimens, also, the tu- mour may descend so low as to alter the relative

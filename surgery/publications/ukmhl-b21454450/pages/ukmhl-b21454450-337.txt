TUMOURS IN THE GROIN. 303 would almost certainly indicate the nature of the malady. If the tumour subsided in the recum- bent position, it is very improbable that any pressure confined strictly to the femoral ring would impede its return, on resuming the upright posture. There is at present a case in St. Bar- tholomew's hospital, which is interesting in con- nexion with this part of the subject. A boy has a lumbar abscess presenting in the upper part of the left thigh, and a femoral hernia on the right side, which I am assured was very distinct before it had assumed some other characters which are at present superadded, and which I believe to depend on the presence of fluid, probably, of course, pus. In examining this boy, I could not prevent the return of some portion of the tumour in question; and on push- ing it suddenly upwards the instant that he coughs, I can distinctly feel a kind of fluctua- tion which, I believe, does not depend on the hernia.

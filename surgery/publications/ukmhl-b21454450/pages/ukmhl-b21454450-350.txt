316^ ON THE DIAGNOSIS OF tumour lies loosely connected with the subja- cent parts, it can readily be drawn from its situation, and in such a case, the cessation of pulsation will explain the kind of connexion with the artery whence the impulse has pro- ceeded ; but when a tumour (although loosely connected to the parts beneath it) is covered by aponeurotic structures, which is of course very likely to happen in the thigh, this cannot be accomplished. An aneurism which affords any pulsation at all,* pulsates with very nearly the same distinctness in all parts, whereas if the case be a tumour deriving its pulsation merely from its contiguity to an artery, the impulse will be most perceptible in the course of the vessel, less palpable as the finger is removed to a greater distance from it, and if the size of the tumour be so great as to allow of this distance being considerable, becoming almost or quite imperceptible. If a tumour lie beneath an artery, its distinction from aneurism is stdl more easy, for here the pulsation will be alto- Â« I have thus expressed myself, because instances have occurred of aneurism, in which no pulsation was perceptible. The extreme rarity of such a case seems to justify my restricting a notice ot it here to the bai'e mention of its possibility.

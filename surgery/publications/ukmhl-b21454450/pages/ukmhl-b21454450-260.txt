226 ON STRICTURE OF THE CESOPHAGUS. The thickening may be an inch or two in ex- tent, and there is one specimen in the museum of the college, in which nearly the whole tube is enormously thickened. A section has been made of it, and the diseased structure is seen interspersed by white fibrous lines, evidently those characterizing carcinomatous deposition.* There is one fact which has occurred to me, in reflecting on the various preparations which I have examined, viz. that where the alteration of structure is near the stomach, it is more frequently the consequence of specific disease, than when it is found in any other part of the canal. If this be so, the fact is important, as I shall endeavour to shew, in speaking of the treatment. The remote causes of stricture of the CESophagus are very obscure; in some cases; the first difficulty in swallowing is described by the patient as having succeeded to some catar- rhal affection, but more frequently there is ♦ Sometimes the oesophagus, without any stricture, has been found dilated in a particular situation, so as to form a large pouch on one side of its usual course. There is a specimen of this in the museum of the college, and another example of it is mentioned by Morgagni. The former is situated high in the neck; the latter, is represented to have been in the middle of the chest—"circa mediimi thoracis." Vide Epist. xxviii.

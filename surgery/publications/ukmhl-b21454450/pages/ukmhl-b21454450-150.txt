116 ON THE LOXG STRICTURE. To this point we may generally introduce a larger catheter at each visit; but afterwards, I have generally found it expedient to introduce the same instrument twice or thrice, before the next in the scale is employed. The cases, however, vary much in severity ; and it is only where a very great change, as I believe, has occurred in the mucous membrane, that the increase of the instrument requires the caution above implied. Should the surgeon in a case of this kind be unable to introduce any instrument, it would be right to give the caustics a trial; for, although they are not applied to the whole stricture, they may remove its anterior surface on the one hand, or diminish its irritability on the other, according as the kali or argenti nitras be employed. Generally, however, they are productive of little advantage; and where they fail, it may be necessary to divide the stricture by an operation, of which I shall speak more fully in a subsequent chapter.

CASES. 185 CASE VII. BEING ONE OF THAT DESCRIPTION IN WHICH I RECOMMEND THE USE OF THE ARGENTI NITRAS. The case which I am about to relate, as an instance where the argenti nitras appeared use- ful, also shews the plan which we are generally obliged to adopt where there are already two or more strictures. I would observe, that where it is practicable it is always advisable to direct our principal attention to that which is posterior. But in cases where caustic is necessary, this is frequently impracticable, before the greater or less dilatation, or destruction of the anterior one is effected. The latter may allow an instru- ment to pass three sizes larger than that which the posterior stricture is capable of admitting, and yet we may not be able to pass even the smaller size through it with sufficient celerity to apply the caustic effectually to that which is most remote from the orifice of the canal; wherefore we may be obliged to continue our applications exclusively to the anterior stricture, until this difficulty is removed.

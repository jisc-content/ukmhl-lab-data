The exact situation and form of the stric- ture should first be taken by a soft bougie, and then that, armed with caustic, should be intro- duced ; a little oil, if it be passed expeditiously, will be sufficient to defend that part of the canal through which it passes to the stricture from being injured. The number of applications which will be advisable, must depend on cir- cumstances. If ever so little progress be made, its use should be persevered in, and we should not lay it aside because no obvious benefit follows each single application. The urethra should be examined at each visit before the caustic is re-applied ; and if, after three suc- cessive applications, ever so little advantage is gained, we are warranted in continuing its use. Should it, on the contrary, be found that no advantage is derived from its continued employ- ment, I would never repeat it more than four or five times, since it can scarcely happen that the stricture shall withstand a greater number of applications. The use of the caustic should here be discontinued, because the probability IS, that it has not been applied accurately to the stricture; there is danger, therefore, of the

TUMOURS IN THE GROl.V. 313 to be impossible. If with an encysted or other tumour in the groin, a patient were to labour under symptoms of strangulated hernia, it would of course be necessary to adopt the prac- tice which has been already recommended. If a patient wished for any support, under the impression that a tumour were hernia, no truss should be applied, unless the reduction of the swelling demonstrated it to be so, with this ex- ception. If the surgeon considered that the case were an irreducible omental hernia, or even that it were probably so, there would be no objection to his applying a light hollow- padded truss, which, whilst it afforded a certain degree of security against further protrusion should the case be hernia, would not injuri- ously press on the tumour, were it not so. I take this opportunity of mentioning a case in which a singular kind of tumour, lay across the groin, extending from the femoral vessels on the one side to the spermatic chord on the other; from which latter, some caution was necessary in detaching the cyst in which it was contained. The tumour occurred in a young man, and had existed for four years.

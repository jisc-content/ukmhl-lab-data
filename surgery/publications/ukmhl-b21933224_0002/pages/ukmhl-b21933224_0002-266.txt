CHAPTER XVIII. THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF NERVES. INJURIES OF NERVES. As far as treatment is concerned, the various traumatic affections of nerves may be considered under three heads—Compression, Contusion, and Division of nerves. Both as regards symptoms and treatment, it will be found that these various groups overlap each other very consider- ably ; nevertheless the subject will be made clearer by treating of each independently. COMPRESSION OF NERVES. —A nerve may be subjected to such a degree of pressure that its functions are materially interfered with for a time at any rate, and under these circumstances a certain amount of pathological change occurs in it. The nerve may be compressed at any portion of its course, but, from the point of view both of symptoms and treatment, it is only necessary to consider the compression as it affects either the trunk of a nerve or its terminal filaments. Again, the compressing force may be severe, and may produce its results rapidly, or it may be milder, and the results may appear more slowly. Lastly, we have to con- sider the question according as the compression is due to injury or to some pathological process. We shall therefore describe compression of nerves •under the following heads : (i) Compression of nerve trunks, which will be ,divided into Traumatic Compression, both rapid and gradual, and Pathological Compression ; (2) Compression of terminal filaments of nerves. 1. Compression of Nerve Trunks.—(a) Rapid Traumatic Com- pression.—Here the pressure to which the nerve is subjected is severe and, although lasting for only a short time, may produce profound changes in the injured nerve. It is very probable that we have in reality to do with an actual contusion, the pressure of the nerve against an adjacent bone leading either to rupture and disorganization, or to effusion of blood in and around its fibres; as an example may be mentioned what is popularly spoken of as "drunkard's" or "Saturday night palsy."

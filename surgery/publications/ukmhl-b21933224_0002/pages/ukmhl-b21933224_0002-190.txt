SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE SKIN. KELOID. The keloid condition of scars has already been mentioned (Part I., Chap. XI., p. 224), but we may here refer to the true or Alibert's keloid, which is supposed to arise spontaneously. These tumours are chiefly situated in front of the sternum and begin as small tubercles which slowly increase in size, sometimes by the coalescence of neighbouring nodules, until they form a firm, more or less prominent tumour with an unequal surface, an irregular shape, and edges of a rosy or violet colour running out in the form of ridges. TREATMENT.â€”This must be on lines similar to that for false keloid (see Part L, Chap. XL, p. 224). Excision is equally unsatisfactory in both, the scar tending to become keloid again. At the same time it is possible that, by excision, a large broad tumour may be converted into a linear one.

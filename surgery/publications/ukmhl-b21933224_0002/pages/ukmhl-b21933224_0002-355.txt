ANEURYSM OF THE EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY. 331 towards the belly of the digastric; its pulsation can be easily felt. The needle should be passed from without inwards, and care must be taken to keep it closely in contact with the artery so as to avoid taking up the superior laryngeal nerve, which is somewhat behind the vessel.

The symptoms of aneurysm of this vessel are very similar to those occurring in the common trunk near its bifurcation, but the swelling is rather higher up in the neck, and the tumour projects beneath the mucous membrane of the pharynx, and indeed generally ruptures into the throat. Treatment.—The treatment should be ligature of the internal carotid artery just above its origin if possible, and if not, both the common and external carotid vessels should be tied (vide supra). A fatal result is very apt to occur in these cases from the cerebral complications which have already been alluded to (see p. 328). ANEURYSM OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. Aneurysms in this situation are more frequently met with on the right side than on the left, and are more common in men than in women. They mostly occur in the third part of the artery, but they may also be met with in the first part and still more rarely in the second. An aneurysm in the first part of the right subclavian artery is often associated with a similar condition in the trunk of the innominate, and the symp-

34 DEFORMITIES AFFECTING THE FINGERS AND TOES. dissected up so as to completely expose all the cicatricial tissue. The central cicatrix and the cicatricial tissue surrounding it are then dissected out, after which it will generally be found that the finger can be brought straight, although in some cases, where the contraction has lasted for a considerable length of time, it may be necessary to divide, in addition, some of the various ligaments around the joints. After the finger has been straightened, the flaps may be got to meet in the middle line throughout the greater part of their extent, a triangular raw space being generally left at either end; the latter must be covered with skin-grafts (see Fig. 22, B). The advantage of this plan over that of simply dividing the cicatrix transversely and then skin-grafting is that over the centre of the finger corresponding, say to the middle phalanx, the raw surface is completely covered in by skin so that no contraction occurs. Should any contraction occur where the skin- grafts have been applied, it is not a matter of such great moment. In order still further to guard against the tendency to contraction, the hand should be put upon an anterior splint, with the finger hyper-extended, until the wound has healed. After about a fortnight's interval, a back splint, similar to that already described for use in Dupuytren's contraction (see Fig. 19), should be substituted, and to this the finger or fingers are fastened back day and night for six or eight weeks. At the end of the first fortnight, when the wound has healed, the splint should be removed three or four times a day, and massage and passive movements carefully carried out. After eight weeks the splint is left off during the day, and the patient should be encouraged to use the fingers constantly. The splint, however, should be worn at night for six or eight months longer.

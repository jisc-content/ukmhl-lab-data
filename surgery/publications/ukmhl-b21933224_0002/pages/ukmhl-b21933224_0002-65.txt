41 FLAT FOOT. an artificial tibialis anticus muscle (see Fig. 25). Mr. Golding Bird's apparatus consists of a suitable sling of webbing encircling the ankle joint, passing down over the outer side of the instep beneath the arch of the foot, and terminating on the inner side just above the head of the astragalus in a hook to which the elastic apparatus is fastened. This consists of a firm india-rubber band or door-spring fastened at its lower extremity to the sling just mentioned, while its upper end is attached to an outside leg-iron which is hinged into the heel of the boot below, and is Fig. 25.â€”Artificial Tibialis Anticus for use in Flat Foot. In the centre is seen the sling of broad webbing which is shown applied to the ankle In the left-hand sketch in which the attachment of the artificial muscle (an india-rubber spring) is shown to the sling below and to the leg band above. In the right-hand figure the apparatus is seen applied with the boot and the leg-iron in position. (Modified from Colding-Bird.) fastened to the leg by an encircling band just opposite the crest of the tibia. The apparatus is applied as follows. After the stocking has been put on, the sling is arranged around the ankle and beneath the instep, and, whilst the free end is firmly pulled upon, the boot is put on and the leg-iron adjusted to the heel. The elastic band is then fastened in position, and the upper end of the leg-iron is adjusted; a suitable slit may be made in the upper leather of the boot, and through this the free end of the sling is passed before the spring is attached to it. In this apparatus the pressure upon the arch of the instep is more uniform and elastic than that exerted by the metal spring. It supports the arch of the foot extremely well, and without any of the pain that is usually more or less marked when a Whit-

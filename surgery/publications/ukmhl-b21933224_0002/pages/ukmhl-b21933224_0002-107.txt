83 THE INDIVIDUAL FORMS OF CLUB-FOOT. become tense, and these must also be divided, either from the same puncture or from another more conveniently situated. It is well also to divide the fascia from a second series of punctures somewhat further forward, and these should be made in front of the transverse crease of the foot. It is very important to make sure that the division of the plantar fascia has been thoroughly effected. Fig. 39.—The Relations of the Various Structures requiring Division in Talipes Equino-Varus. - A. Tibialis posticus tendon ; usual seat of division. B. Flexor longus digitorum muscle; if it requires division this is usually performed a little lower down. C. Tendo Achillis. Point at which it is usually divided. D. Flexor longus pollicis muscle. Usually divided lower down. E. Tibialis amicus tendon ; usual seat of division. F. Plantar fascia. Point at which it is generally divided. Q. Abductor pollicis muscle. H. Extensor longus pollicis tendon. I. Posterior tibial artery. K. Posterior tibial nerve. L. Part of aimtilur ligament. M. Sapliena vein. {Snchsen.) Thirdly, in most cases, it is important also to divide the ligaments which •oppose reduction. It is true that in comparatively mild cases the tight ligamentous structures may now be torn across by forcibly wrenching the foot into position, either with the hand alone, or with a Thomas's wrench, but in the majority of cases it is much better to divide the ligaments systematically in the manner recommended by Mr. Parker. This especially applies to the anterior part of the deltoid ligament of the ankle joint, which, if not divided,

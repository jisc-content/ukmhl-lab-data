ANEURYSM OF THE EXTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY. superficial fascia, and anterior part of the sheath of the rectus are divided, and the rectus is either pulled inwards, or, if very well developed, its fibres may be separated a little to the inner side of the linea semilunaris. The posterior sheath of the rectus is then divided, and after that the transversalis fascia and the peritoneum. By making the incision a little to the inner side, opening the sheath of the rectus, and either splitting it up or pushing it aside, the chance of hernia after the operation is some- what less than where the incision is carried accurately through the linea semilunaris; this incision gives good access to the external iliac vessel Fig. 121.—Ligature of the Common Iliac Artery through the Linea Alba.— The pelvis is raised, the intestines kept up by Maunsell's intestine guard and sponges kept in place by retractors. An incision has been made in the peritoneum over the artery, preparatory to clearing the vessel for ligature. The ureter (U) is seen just over the bifurcation of the vessel. (see Fig. 122). Should it be found during the course of the opera- tion that it is necessary to tie the common trunk, perfectly satisfactory access to it can be gained by prolonging the upper end of the incision in the abdominal wall somewhat inwards towards the middle line. After the abdomen has been opened by either of these incisions the intestines are carefully pushed upwards to the opposite side and kept in position by means of suitable flat abdominal sponges or a special intestine retractor (see Fig. 123). On the right side the cfecum and the adjacent part of the ileum are displaced upwards, and on the left

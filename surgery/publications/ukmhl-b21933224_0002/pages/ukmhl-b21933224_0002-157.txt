CONGENITAL DISLOCATION OF THE HIP. 133 The child is placed under the influence of an anfesthetic, a well-padded perineal band is applied and fastened to the head of the bed, and pulleys are attached to the leg above the ankle, or, in bad cases in which much force will be required, to the thigh above the knee, so as to diminish the chance of fracture of the femur. E.xtension is then gradually and steadily made so as to bring the head of the bone downwards, and it should be continued until the top of the trochanter is slightly below Nelaton's line; should this procedure be difficult, it may be considerably facilitated by pressing, squeezing, and kneading the tense muscles, especially at their points of attachment to the bone (see Fig. 62). The perineum should be Fig. 62.—LoRENz's Non-operative Method for Congenital Dislocation of THE Hip. J^irst Stage. While an assist.int makes counter-exten.sion by a perineal band, the .surgeon forcibly pulls down the head of the bone until it is opposite the acetabulum. The traction is made outwards as well as downwards, so as to stretch the adductors. In a very young child the pulleys mentioned in the text are not necessary. watched to see that no injurious pressure is exerted upon it, and it is well to relax the extension from time to time. Besides employing downward extension, it should be altered in direction from time to time so as to strongly abduct the limb; by this means the adductors and the tense structures on the inner side of the thigh are stretched. It is also well to over-extend the hip joint. The point of primary importance is that extension should be carried out steadily, smoothly, and gradually, and not violently or in jerks ; if it be roughly done serious damage may be caused, and the femur may even be fractured.

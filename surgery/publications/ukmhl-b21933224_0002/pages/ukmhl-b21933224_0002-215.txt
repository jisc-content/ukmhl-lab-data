CHAPTER XIV. THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF BURS^. WOUNDS. It must be remembered that the bursal cavities are in close relation with the lymphatic vessels, and therefore any septic infection of them is particularly dangerous, and may lead to very violent inflammation. For example, when the bursa over the olecranon has been punctured, enormous swelling of the arm with great redness and oedema not at all uncommonly results. The bursa and the parts around become acutely inflamed, and the redness of the skin often closely resembles erysipelas. So great is the swelling in proportion to the damage done to the bursa, that, in cases in which the puncture is not easily visible, it might be difficult to make out the main seat of the inflammation if these facts were not clearly borne in mind. TREATMENT.—When, therefore, a bursa is wounded, great care must be taken to disinfect the wound, and for this purpose the entire bursal cavity should be swabbed out with undiluted carbolic acid, the opening, if necessary, being enlarged for the purpose, whilst the skin around is disinfected in the ordinary manner. A drainage tube is then inserted into the cavity and antiseptic dressings are applied. The after-treatment must be conducted on the lines already laid down for the treatment of accidental wounds (see Part I., Chap. IX.). If a considerable interval has elapsed before the case is seen, and inflammation has already set in, the cavity must be laid freely open, sponged with undiluted carbolic acid, and packed with strips of gauze impregnated with iodoform ; if the inflammation be very great, warm boracic fomenta- tions (see Part I., p. 48) may be applied outside. BURSITIS. ACUTE BURSITIS.—Inflammation of a bursa may be acute or chronic. Acute bursitis occurs either as a serous or a purulent inflam-

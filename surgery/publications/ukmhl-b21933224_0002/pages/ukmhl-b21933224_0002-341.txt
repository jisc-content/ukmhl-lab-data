CHAPTER XXI. SURGICAL TREATMENT OF SPECIAL ANEURYSMS. ANEURYSM OF THE THORACIC AORTA. These aneurysms seldom come under the notice of the surgeon until they have become so large as to project from the wall of the thorax and threaten to burst through the skin. Treatment.—Under such circumstances all that can be done to re- inforce the medical treatment is to promote coagulation within the sac- wall by one or other of the methods already described—preferably by galvano-puncture or by the introduction of Macewen's needles. This treatment, however, is very seldom successful in completely arresting the progress of the disease; to some extent no doubt this is because the surgeon is seldom called in until the last stage of the disease has been reached. Distal ligature.—In cases of aneurysm of the arch of the aorta, some degree of success has occasionally followed Hgature of one or more of the large vessels of the neck. Complete cure cannot, however, well be expected from this method because, of course, the circulation through the aneurysm must remain free in spite of the operation. The vessels on the left side of the neck are usually tied, and the best success seems to have followed ligature of the left common carotid. In some cases the left subclavian artery has also been tied, either alone or in addition to the carotid; when it is decided to tie both vessels it is well to do it simul- taneously. This operation is unsuited for cases in which there is valvular disease of the heart, in which the aneurysm is not definitely sacculated or in which it is of very large size, and especially when it presses upon the bronchi. ANEURYSM OF THE ABDOMINAL AORTA. Compression.—Here the aid of the surgeon is also sometimes sought, and in most cases this is the only method which can be employed. Com-

ANEURYSM OF THE COMMON CAROTID ARTERY. 327 formed, because the proximity of the aneurysmal sac and the disturbance to the soft parts caused by the aneurysm renders Hgature of the in- nominate artery impossible. When the aneurysm involves the bifurcation of the carotid or is quite close to it, it is generally advisable to ligature the internal and the common carotid simultaneously, because the free anastomosis of the branches of the external carotid would otherwise tend to defeat the operation.

Descendens noni nerve. has already been described (see p. 320), but when the aneurysm is situated at the upper part of the vessel, it is usually advisable to apply the ligature to the vessel below the point at which the omo-hyoid crosses it. In order to do this, the patient is placed in the same position as for ligature above the omo-hyoid, and an incision about three inches in length is made in the line of the artery commencing immediately above the sterno-clavicular articulation, and extending upwards to the level of the cricoid cartilage. In this incision the anterior jugular vein may be exposed and will require ligature ; it should be seized with forceps in

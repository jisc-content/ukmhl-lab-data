212 SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF MUSCLES. NEW GROWTHS. PRIMARY TUMOURS of muscle are rare. The most common are the cavernous angiomata which occur about the masseter, the muscles of the cheek, etc. They are characterized by the presence of an enlarge- ment of the muscle of a soft character, which increases on coughing or crying, and which disappears almost entirely when pressure is made upon it; it re-appears immediately the pressure is left off. The treatment for tumours of this character is electrolysis (see Part I., p. 266). Of other primary neoplasms, lipomata occur within the muscular sheaths, myxomata are met with, and sometimes also sarcoma. SECONDARY TUMOURS of muscle. Usually, however, tumours of muscles are secondary. They attack the muscles by direct extension, as in cases of epithelioma of the lip or tongue, cancer of the breast, stomach, etc., or they may result from metastasis. The treatment of cases of this kind consists of excision, the amount to be removed depending on the nature of the tumour. For example, a lipoma may be shelled out of its sheath, while a sarcoma must be removed along with a considerable portion of the muscle around. In the case of carcinoma the whole muscle should be taken away.

ANEURYSM OF THE EXTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY. incision lies over the artery (see Fig. 126). By this method the artery is freely exposed below, and should the case be one in which the ligature can be applied to the lower part of the external iliac trunk this incision is the better one, because it causes the least weakening of the abdominal wall and the smallest amount of disturbance of the soft parts. When, how- ever, the artery requires to be ligatured high up, or when there is a possibility of the common or the internal iliac requiring ligature, Aber- nethy's incision is the better. In both operations the muscles are divided to the full extent of the skin incision and any bleeding points are secured as they are cut.

Transversalis fascia. N. Genito-crural nerve. After the muscles have been divided, the transversalis fascia is opened below, and the opening then extended to the full extent of the external wound. This exposes the sub-peritoneal fat and fascia which lies immediately over the peritoneum. Care must be taken to identify these structures, as it is very common in ligaturing these vessels to mistake the transversalis fascia for the peritoneum, and to strip it up from the iliac fossa, carrying with it of course the vessels, so that they are in front of the finger; then, when the surgeon desires to pass the ligature he cannot find the vessels. After the transversalis fascia has been divided throughout the whole length of the wound, the patient is rolled over towards the sound side, and the peritoneum is gently separated from the psoas and iliacus muscles until

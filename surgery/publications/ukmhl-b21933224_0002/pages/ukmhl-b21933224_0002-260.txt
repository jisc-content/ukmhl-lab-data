236 SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF TENDONS. portion which lies over the patella is cut away so that the lower end is of a horse-shoe shape, and the sides of the horse-shoe surround the upper and lateral borders of that bone. The strapping is firmly bandaged to the thigh, and on each side of the patella pieces of tape are sewn on to it, and to these the extension apparatus is attached. The limb is then placed on a back splint, with a foot-piece at right angles, and at the sides of the foot-piece, close to the heel, holes are bored or bars are fitted, to which the extension apparatus can be attached. One end of a piece of india- rubber tubing is tied to each of the tapes just mentioned, and the other attached to the foot-piece of the splint or the bars upon it (see Fig. 86). By tightening these, any degree of tension required can be employed, with Fig. 86.â€”Rupture of Ligamentum Pateli..1! tkeateo by Position. For the sake of clearness tlie bandages fastening the limb to the splint have been omitted. a view of bringing down the patella. The limb is kept considerably elevated, so as to relax the quadriceps extensor femoris. This apparatus should be kept on for about six weeks, the limb being gradually lowered during that time, and great care must be taken afterwards, when the patient begins to walk, to increase the flexion of the joint very slowly, lest the union should again give away. Cases may be met with in which rupture of the ligamentum patellae has occurred a considerable time before the patient comes under notice, and no proper union has resulted; they should be operated upon on the lines already laid down. A curved incision is made, the remains of the tendon defined, refreshed, and brought together in the manner just described (see p. 235). In one case on which we operated lately the

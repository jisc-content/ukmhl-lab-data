126 CURVATURES OF THE NECK OF THE FEMUR. position, the tendency is to swing the other forward into a similar position, and thus there is a constant attempt on the part of the muscles aided by the weight of the limb to undo the curvature of the neck on the side not operated upon. However this may be, the fact remains that improve- ment in this respect has followed in both our cases. Notwithstanding Fig. 6o.â€”Result of Subtrochanteric Division of the Femur in a Case of Coxa Vara. This is from a photograph of the same child as that in Figs. 55 and 56, and was taken nearly a year after the operation referred to in the text, i.e. suGtrochanteric osteotomy of the femur and the application of an aluminium plate to keep the fragments in position after the lower limb had been fully inverted. The right foot is in a fairly normal position, while the left leg (which was not operated upon) remains in its original position. The child could walk and run well. (See Clin. Soc. Trans., vol. xxvii., p. 299.) this improvement in rotation, however, the shortening of the limb and the elevation of the trochanter on the side not operated upon has pro- gressed; we would therefore strongly advise that both legs should be operated upon in spite of this somewhat favourable result. The second improvement noted, apparently as the result of the operation, is that the progress of the disease, on the side operated upon has come to a complete standstill. In the cases referred to there was

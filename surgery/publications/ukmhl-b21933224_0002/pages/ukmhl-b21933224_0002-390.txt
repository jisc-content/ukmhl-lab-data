366 SURGICAL TREATMENT OF SPECIAL ANEURYSMS. Ligature of the Anterior Tibial Artery.—This vessel may be tied at any part of its course. The operation is most frequently done in the upper or the lower third. The line of the artery is from a point midway between the crest of the tibia and the head of the fibula to another on the front of the ankle midway between the two malleoli. Before the operation is performed it is well to rotate the leg somewhat inwards, and flex and extend the foot so as to trace out the lines of the tendons and muscles. (a) In Upper Third.—When the vessel requires ligature in the upper third, an incision from three to four inches in length should be made over the line of the artery, commencing about an inch below the external tuberosity of the tibia. After division of the skin and Fig. 137.—Ligature of the Left Anterior Tibial in the Upper Third.— T.A. Tibialis amicus. A. Anterior tibial artery. V. Vense comites. E.D. Extensor loiigus digitorum.

Fascia lata. fascia the outer edge of the tibialis anticus, as it arises from the external tuberosity, is seen, and the inter-muscular septum between this muscle and the extensor longus digitorum is opened up. While this is being done it is well to flex the foot so as to relieve the tension upon the muscles, and to enable them to be separated more easily.

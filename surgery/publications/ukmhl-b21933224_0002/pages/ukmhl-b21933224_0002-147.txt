123 COXA VARA. be rotated so as to overcome the rotation outwards. This is done by fastening to the hooks (a) an elastic door spring of suitable strength which thus pulls the toes together while the heels remain separated by the transverse bar (c). In order to get the full effect of the apparatus, the splint must be firmly incorporated with the limb, and this is best done by plaster of Paris which is put on over a bandage of boracic lint, and in the layers of which the posterior iron bar is included (see Fig. 58). The weight used for extension should be three or four pounds to commence with, according to the size of the child; this may be increased later. Fig. 58.—Extension Apparatus for Coxa Vara applied. The iron bars are in- corporated in the layers of a plaster of Paris bandage so that the limbs are immovably fixed to them. Extension is made with the limbs abducted and well rotated inwards. The extension is applied in a somewhat upward direction to avoid the friction caused by the heavy splint lying flat on the bed. The apparatus will require renewal fairly frequently, as it is very liable to become soiled with urine ; it should be taken off about once a fortnight and a fresh one applied. When the casing has been removed, the limb should be well washed and the whole extremity massaged; in addition to this, it is well to practice repeated manipulations, such as inversion, flexion, and adduction, before the splint is again applied. {d) Operative.—Should no improvement result after a careful and pro- longed trial of this method, the time will come as the child grows older and attempts to walk, when some form of operative procedure designed to overcome the excessive outward rotation will have to be considered. Of these the surgeon has the choice between two alternatives, either

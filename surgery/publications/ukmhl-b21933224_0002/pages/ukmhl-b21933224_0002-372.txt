348 SURGICAL TREATMENT OF SPECIAL ANEURYSMS. through an incision extending from a point an inch internal to the anterior superior iliac spine to another half an inch outside the external abdominal Fig. 124.—Mattrass Suture for use in Laparotomy. This stitch is merely an application of Macewen's hernia stitch. The method of passing the thread is shown in the sketch. It may be introduced either by an ordinary surgical needle or, better, by the handled needle shown in the figure. A very simple plan of introducing the suture is to pass the needle unthreaded through the two opposing cut surfaces, pass the thread through the eye and withdraw the needle, carrying one end of the thread with it. This leaves the needle threaded to a suture which traverses both lips of the wound. The threaded needle is now thrust through the edge of the incision from which it last emerged, carried across the wound, made to pierce the opposite side, and the suture unthreaded. The needle is now withdrawn, leaving the loop shown above in situ. This is not the method of insert- ing the stitch illustrated above.

The a, Abernethy's. b, Astley Cooper's, ends of the sutures are cut short, and the skin is afterwards united by a separate continuous suture. ring. This gives an incision about three inches in length, about an inch above Poupart's ligament, and almost parallel to it; the centre of the

CHAPTER XX. THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF ARTERIES. TRAUMATIC AFFECTIONS. WOUNDS of arteries and their treatment have been already fully referred to in speaking of wounds in general (see Part I., p. 127), and we need not here go into the subject again. It may, however, be worth while to mention that quite recently Senn and others have united the cu ends of large arteries (which had been completely divided) by fine catgut stitches, instead of tying them as would be the ordinary procedure. They state that the results have been in some cases satisfactory; that is to say, instead of a thrombus forming and obliteration of the artery resulting as one would naturally expect, the lumen of the artery has remained patent, the blood has flowed on as before, and the wound in the vessel has healed. It is, of course, very seldom that the opportunity of carrying out such a procedure would present itself, and as the matter is quite in the experimental stage we need not do more than mention it as one that is worth while bearing in mind. Apart from transverse division of arteries, however, this point is also worth while remembering in the case of punctures of large arteries or secondary haemorrhage at the point of origin of a branch from a main vessel. This especially applies to the common carotid artery at its bifurcation, ligature of which with one or other of its main divisions is very likely to be followed by hemiplegia and death. Thus, in hjemorrhage, after ligature of the external carotid, where the bleeding is practically from the wall of the main artery, it might be better to put one or two stitches (by Lembert's method) in the wall of the artery than to ligature the main vessel. INJURIES of arteries, either in the form of contusion of the coats or subcutaneous rupture of the artery, unaccompanied by a wound in the skin, will be referred to immediately in speaking of aneurysm. Then also we shall speak of punctured wounds of the skin involving an artery.

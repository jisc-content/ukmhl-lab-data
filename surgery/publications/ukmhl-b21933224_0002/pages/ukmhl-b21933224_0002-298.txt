SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF NERVES. THE ANTERIOR CRURAL NERVE.—This nerve somelimes requires to be exposed, and is best reached where it passes into the thigh between the psoas and iliacus muscles. The nerve trunk has only a short course, as it soon breaks up into its terminal branches. The psoas muscle intervenes between it and the artery. It should be exposed by a vertical incision two or more inches in length just external to the line of the artery, and, after the fascia lata has been divided, the hip joint is slightly flexed, when the nerve will at once be exposed on the outer side of the femoral artery. THE INTERNAL SAPHENOUS NERVE.—This nerve rarely requires to be exposed, but should it be necessary to cut down upon it, a very useful and constant guide is found in the internal saphena vein, which lies just in front of it opposite the internal tuberosity of the tibia.

SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE NAILS. 1/2 and falls off; or the condition may begin with an abcess beneath the nail, which falls off and leaves an ulcerating surface beneath. Treatment.—The nail should be removed, the softened tissue thor- oughly scraped away, and the part sponged over with undiluted carbolic acid. The best dressing to use at first is wet iodoform gauze sprinkled plentifully with iodoform, with a piece of mackintosh outside, which keeps it moist, and forms a wet antiseptic fomentation. Subsequently, when the parts assume a healthy aspect, the dilute boracic ointment (one quarter the pharmacopoeial strength) may be substituted. In addition to this local treatment, the general principles of treatment for tuberculosis, which have already been referred to in Part I., p. 245, must be attended to. TUMOURS. Sub-ungual exostoses.—This is the term applied to little tumours which grow beneath the nails. In some cases, however, they are not really exostoses, but are softer tumours of a fibromatous or papillomatous nature, and indeed are not infrequently sarcomatous. They press up the nail and cause a good deal of pain, and the treatment is to remove the nail and cut or gouge away the tumour; if there be a suspicion that the growth is malignant, amputation of the toe should be performed.

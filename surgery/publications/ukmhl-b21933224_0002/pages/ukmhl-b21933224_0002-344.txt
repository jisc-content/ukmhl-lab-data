320 SURGICAL TREATMENT OF SPECIAL ANEURYSMS. there is considerable risk attending tlie performance of this operation, as it interferes markedly with the cerebral circulation, which is already consider- ably diminished by the ligature of the common carotid. It is moreover an operation which is extremely difficult of performance, because the sac gets in the way of the operator, and not only prevents the proper identi- fication of the vessel, but runs considerable risk of being punctured. On the whole, it is best not to attempt to ligature this vessel for an innominate aneurysm. When the aneurysm is of the fusiform variety these operations will do no good; should, therefore, the diagnosis of a fusiform aneurysm have been made beforehand, the best plan is to leave the patient alone. Lig'ature of the Common Carotid Artery above the Omo- hyoid.—Ligature of the common carotid trunk for innominate aneurysm is performed as follows; the skin is shaved and disinfected, and the patient placed on his back, with the shoulders somewhat raised upon a sandbag Fig. I02.—Ligature of the Right Common Carotid above the Omo-hyoid.— S.M.

An incision about three inches in length is made along the line of the artery, that is to say, in a line from the sterno-clavicular articula- tion to a point midway between the angle of the jaw and the mastoid

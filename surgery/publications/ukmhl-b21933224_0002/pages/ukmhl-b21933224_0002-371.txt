ANEURYSM OF THE EXTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY. it should be closed by a catgut stitch, and the abdominal incision sutured in the usual manner, the peritoneum being first stitched up with a fine con- tinuous catgut suture, the muscles on either side being brought together Fig. 123.—Maunsell's Intestine Guard. The wire frame is covered with gauze. The handle can be set at any angle. by two or three silk sutures inserted after the style of Macewen's hernia stitches—commonly spoken of as the " mattrass stitch" (see Figs. 124 and 125)—and the skin being united with a continuous silk suture. (b) Extra-peritoneal Method.-—The extra-peritoneal ligature of the external or common iliac artery is not in our opinion a good method for cases in which the aneurysm is situated upon those vessels. It may, how- ever, be employed with advantage when the aneurysm is situated high up on the superficial femoral. There are two methods of performing this operation, which are known respectively as Abernethy's and Astley Cooper's. Abernethy's Operation.—In Abernethy's operation a curved incision from four to five inches in length with its convexity downwards and out- wards is made from about an inch and a half external to the centre of Poupart's ligament, and the same distance above it, upwards and outwards, to a point about an inch above and internal to the anterior superior spine of the ilium (see Fig. 126). Should it be necessary to tie the common iliac, the incision is simply extended further upwards. Astley Cooper's Operation.—Astley Cooper's operation is performed

CHAPTER X. THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE NAILS. Various anomalies of growth and degenerations of the nails occur, but of these it is hardly necessary to speak, because there is no special treat- ment applicable to them. HYPERTROPHY. Hypertrophy of the nails is not uncommon, the nails becoming thickened and marked by transverse depressions, while the tip of the nail becomes unduly curved. In old people the nail of the great toe and sometimes, to a lesser extent, those of the others may assume the shape of a horn, the point of which turns over towards the sole or curves round and threatens to grow into either the nail matrix or the free end of the toe. This affection is often a result of inflammation or injury, and is called onycMa gryphosa. Treatment.—For these conditions there is no special treatment. In onychia gryphosa, when the nail assumes the shape of a horn, it must be carefully pared, as otherwise its tip will grow into the matrix and cause ulceration. When the horn is very massive and dense the entire nail and its matrix may require removal. INJURIES. CONTUSIONS.—Among injuries of the nails contusions call for mention, as they are often followed by separation of the nail from its bed. The effect of the contusion is usually to cause haemorrhage between the nail and the matrix; when the latter has been badly contused, and blood is seen as a black mass beneath the nail, separation of the nail can sometimes be prevented by making a hole through it over the htemorr- hage so as to allow the blood to escape. This is easily done by scraping with a piece of glass or the edge of a knife until the nail is thin enough

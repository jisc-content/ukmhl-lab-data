The line usually given for an incision for tying the vessel is one from the posterior border of the head of the fibula to a point midway Fig. 141.—Ligature of the Right Posterior Tibial in Lower Third.— D.

The artery is generally tied in the lower third, but it can be tied in the upper third near its origin through the incision made for ligature of the posterior tibial in that situation (see p. 367). In ligaturing it in the lower third an incision is made in the line of the vessel, the deep fascia divided and the outer border of the soleus muscle exposed and drawn inwards. Beneath this are seen the fibres of the flexor longus hallucis covered by a tendinous expansion. On separating the fle.xor longus hallucis from the posterior surface of the fibula the artery is found at the outer border of the tibialis posticus muscle. PT. II. A 2

346 SURGICAL TREATMENT OF SPECIAL ANEURYSMS. the sigmoid flexure of the rectum. The direction and extent to which this latter structure can be displaced will depend upon the position of the meso-sigmoid in relation to the external iliac artery; Fig. 122.â€”Ligature of the Right External or Internal Iliac through the LiNEA Semilunaris. This incision comes more directly over the point at which the ligature is to be applied. The ureter (U) is seen crossing at the bifurcation. usually it can be displaced upwards. The limits of the aneurysm are next defined with the finger and the pulsation of the artery felt for above the point where the dilatation commences. It is also important that the position at which the ureter crosses the vessel should be made out. An incision is then made in the peritoneum over the vessel, the latter is carefully cleared and the ligature passed from within outwards. On the right side the artery is readily accessible, and the peri- toneum may be incised directly over it without fear of bleeding; on the left side there may be many large arterial branches running in the meso- sigmoid, and in that case it is better to incise the peritoneum near the middle line, and to raise it outwards over the vein until the artery is reached. In the iliac vessels, as in the innominate, it is well to employ the double ligature recommended by Ballance and Edmunds (see p. 306), at any rate for the common iliac artery, so as to avoid complete division of the coats of the vessel. Great care must be taken in clearing the vessel on the right side to avoid puncturing the vein. After the vessel has been tied, the opening in the peritoneum over

CONGENITAL DISLOCATION OF THE HIP. be employed until the child is two or three years old, and then Lorenz's bloodless method (see p. 131) should be carefully carried out. It is only in the event of complete failure of this method, or in cases which do not come under observation until the child is seven or eight years of age, that the open operation should be resorted to. The latter is a very serious matter when performed on very young children. The operation is pro- longed, and there is, therefore, great risk from shock, and a considerable amount of blood is lost; further, accidents, such as prolonged suppuration and general septic infection, have also happened. Although, of course, these ought not to occur, it must be admitted that, the operation being a very prolonged one, it is easy for accidental infection to occur during its course, and, moreover, since it is in the immediate vicinity of the perineum, the wound is very apt to become soiled subsequently, and, therefore, the risks of sepsis can never be entirely ignored.

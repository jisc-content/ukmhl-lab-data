CURVED TIBIA AND FIBULA. I02 not press upon the splint. The limb is made to fit the splint exactly by- means of a number of pads of suitable size and shape packed in on each side and below the limb, which may thus be fixed in any position that is most suitable. It is well to place a special pad over the front of the knee and leg, and by graduating the padding any desired amount of inversion or eversion of the foot can be obtained; generally speaking a large long pad should be applied opposite the point of greatest convexity of the curve that it is required to obliterate, and smaller thicker ones between the ends of the bones and the side of the splint. The latter is then fastened round the limb by broad bandages, and the whole is laid upon an inclined plane to which it may be secured by one or two strips of bandage. In about a week or ten days the splint may be undone, the stitches removed, and a collodion dressing applied. Any additional correction of the deformity may then be made, if necessary, under an anaesthetic, and the limb put up in the fully rectified position in a plaster of Paris or silicate of potash bandage and left for about six weeks for union to occur; it is of course necessary that the foot should be strictly at right angles. In six weeks' time the old bandage may be taken off and a fresh one applied for a similar period, when the union should be thoroughly firm. For another six weeks the patient is forbidden to bear weight upon the limb, to which massage and passive movement should be regularly applied. At the end of this time, that is to say, in from four to five months after the operation, all treatment may be discontinued and the patient allowed to walk.

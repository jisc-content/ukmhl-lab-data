128 CURVATURES OF THE NECK OF THE FEMUR. the top of the trochanter and running downwards on the anterior and outer aspect of the limb. The cellular interval between the sartorius and the tensor vaginee femoris is opened after division of the fascia lata, and the soft structures trochanter, and drill through it into the proximal portion of the neck, an ivory peg being driven into the track thus made so as to keep the cut surfaces in firmer apposition. After the operation the limb should be put up in plaster of Paris in the fully corrected position and kept there for about six weeks; the best form is a spica bandage ex- tending from below the knee up around the pelvis. In about six weeks union will be complete and passive movement may then be begun. are pushed inwards and held out of the way by retractors. This exposes the outer part of the neck of the femur, from which a wedge is removed with a chisel and hammer; in cases where there is external rotation, the base of the wedge should look forwards and upwards, the apex pointing downwards and backwards. The hmb should then be rotated inwards until the sides of the wedge-shaped cavity thus made are in contact, and it is well, in order to keep the limb in proper position after the operation, to make a second small incision over the outer surface of the Fig. 6i.â€”V-Shaped Osteotomy of THE Neck of the Femur for Coxa Vara. To show diagrammatically the extent and direction of the wedge removed.

CHAPTER IX. THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE SKIN AND SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUES {Continued). TUMOURS OF THE SKIN. SEBACEOUS CYSTS. The most common tumours of the skin are probably sebaceous cysts. They consist of a cavity lined with squamous epithelium, and containing epidermic scales, sebaceous matter, and cholesterin. They originate from a blocking of the orifice of the sebaceous duct and dilatation of the gland behind; it is usual to find in the centre of a cyst of this kind a small pit which corresponds to the blocked orifice of the duct. The sebaceous tumours are situated in the skin itself, and are therefore distinguished from dermoid cysts which occur in the subcutaneous tissue. The tumours are at first flattened, and then become spherical; they are closely connected with the skin, and consequently move with it. They generally occur in parts, such as the scalp, where there is hair. TREATMENT.—The cyst is encapsuled, so that if the wall be defined it can be shelled out without difficulty; the cyst-wall is very tough and firm in parts where the skin is thick and coarse, whereas it is thin and easily torn where the skin is thinner, as on the face. In this situation the cyst- wall is apt to tear if pulled upon, whereas in the scalp the cyst can be pulled out, if the skin be divided freely enough, the wall being so firm that it does not tear even on considerable traction. If any part of the wall be left behind the cyst will re-form. Sebaceous cysts of the Scalp.—The hair must be shaved for at least half an inch around the tumour. Patients often object strongly to this, but it must be done. The skin and hair around are rubbed over with turpentine, thoroughly scrubbed and washed with strong mixture, and the hair converted into an antiseptic mass by rubbing into it double cyanide of mercury and zinc powder made into a paste with a 1-20 carbolic acid

ANEURYSM OF THE INNOMINATE ARTERY. 323 of them at least will require ligature and division ; care should be taken of course, to clamp them in two places before they are divided. Tlie sterno-mastoid muscle with the fat and the veins beneath it are then drawn inwards, and the omo-hyoid upwards by means of retractors. This exposes a triangular space which is bounded above and on the outer side by the omo-hyoid, on the inner side by the edge of the anterior scalene muscle, and below by the first rib. In this space will be seen the cords of the brachial plexus above, and the subclavian artery below as it passes over the first rib Below the subclavian artery, but separated from it by the Fig. 103.—Ligature of the Third Part of the Left Subclavian.— S.M.

Brachial plexus—the lowest cord is seen almost in contact vi-ith the artery. anterior scalene muscle, is the subclavian vein, which should not, however, be seen during the course of the operation. Behind the artery is the lowest cord of the brachial plexus (see Fig. 103). The finger is next introduced into the wound and the outer edge of the anterior scalene muscle is felt for and traced downwards to the scalene tubercle on the first rib. When the tip of the finger rests upon this tubercle, the artery can be felt pulsating under its pulp. After the vessel has been identified, the sheath is opened where the vessel lies upon the first rib, the opening seized with catch forceps in the manner described for the ligature of the carotid artery (see p. 321), and a blunt probe, or, better, an un-

At first sight the latter plan seems the more promising; in young children, however, it is difficult to perform it satisfactorily and even more difficult to ensure that the limb is kept in proper position while union is taking place. Sub-trochanteric division of the femur.—In children we have obtained extremely good results by dividing the femur below the trochanters.^ The operation is done as follows: an incision is made commencing just below the upper border of the great trochanter aud running vertically downwards for three or four inches. It should be carried directly down to the bone, which is then cleared with a rugine and divided transversely just below the lesser trochanter with a fine-bladed saw. The great tro- chanter is then pushed as far forwards as it will go, while the leg and Fig. 59.—Sub-Trochanteric Division of the Femur for Coxa Vara. This is the operation described in the text. The application of the aluminium plate is shown diagrammatically from the front in A. The view in B is from behind, and shows the alteration in position of the linea aspera. Here the aluminium is represented by the dotted outline. the lower part of the femur are rotated inwards until the limb lies in a position of complete internal rotation. In order to obtain accurate union with the limb in this position and to prevent the possibility of outward rotation recurring, we have fastened the bones together by means of

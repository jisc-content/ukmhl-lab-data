93 THE INDIVIDUAL FORMS OF CLUB-FOOT. upper edge of the wound is folded upon itself and sutured together (see Fig. 42). After the wound has been sutured the usual cyanide dressings are applied and the foot is placed upon a suitable splint. The best is a posterior splint along the back of the leg, furnished with a foot-piece at right angles, and the greatest care must be taken to see that the os calcis- as well as the anterior part of the foot is well everted. As in the less severe forms of this affection, it is well to leave the division of the tendo Achillis until union has occurred between the bony sur- faces. After about ten days, the stitches are removed and the foot is put up in plaster of Paris in the rectified position; this casing should be kept on for about a month. It may then be removed, and the tendo Achillis and, if necessary, the posterior ligament of the ankle joint, should be divided. The after-treatmefit is that already dealt with in detail when speaking of talipes equinus (see p. 59), the chief trouble being the eversion of the OS calcis, which is most difificult to remedy. The patient must be kept under observation and provided with careful mechanical treatment by suitable shoes for at least two or three years, for, even after an operation of this radical nature, a relapse may occur if the treatment be abandoned too soon. Should any tendency to a relapse manifest itself, it may be overcome at an early stage by wrenching the foot and again putting il up in plaster of Paris; but even up to the end of his life the patient should wear specially strong boots with the sole some- what thickened along the outer border, and the inner side of the boot cut straight and made of very stiff leather so as to prevent adduction of the front part of the foot.

In this operation the nerve is exposed by a free incision of suitable length immediately over its course, freed from the surrounding parts and stretched. In a large nerve this is generally performed by the fingers; in Fig. 93.—Operation for Exposure of the Great Sciatic Nerve.— G.M. Gluteus maximus muscle. B. Biceps muscle. S.T. Semi-tendinosus muscle. N. Great sciatic nerve, with spatula passed beneath it. a smaller one it is done by introducing beneath it a blunt hook or similar instrument, upon which the nerve is lifted and traction is thus exerted. In order to describe the method more minutely, we may take as an example the operation upon the sciatic nerve, which is the one most frequently per- formed. The nerve is exposed by an incision five or six inches long made directly over its course; the centre of the incision corresponds to the lower edge of the gluteus maximus muscle. When the fibres of the latter are exposed, they are hooked well up out of the way by large retractors, the deep fascia of the thigh divided, and the nerve found by following the outer edge of the biceps muscle, beneath and to the outer side of which it lies (see Fig. 93). The nerve is freed from the surround- ing parts by one or two strokes of the knife or a suitable dissector, one or two fingers are hooked around it, and by their means it is gradually pulled well up out of the wound, and traction exerted upon it. It should always be pulled sufficiently far out of the wound to allow the whole hand to pass between it and the back of the thigh (see Fig. 94). The exact amount of force that it is advisable to employ so as to stretch a nerve effectually without damaging it, will vary of course with the par-

CLUB-FOOT. 62 (2) Tn the second grroup of cases, in which changes other than the shortening of the tendo Achillis occur, the secondary contractions must be remedied before the tendon is divided. The most important contraction is that of the plantar fascia, the dense central portion of which is most commonly affected; the shortening may be so extreme as to actually pro- duce the condition known as talipes cavus. Division of the platitar fascia should be practised and the foot unrolled «ome weeks before the tenotomy of the tendo Achillis is done. Should the latter structure be divided at the same time as the plantar fascia, it will be found a matter of the most extreme difficulty to stretch the sole sufficiently, Fig. 29.—Boot for use after Tenotomy of Tendo Achillis. The dotted line shows the position the boot tends to assume when the foot is oflF the ground ; it thus continuously stretches the tendo Achillis. The boot should be made a good deal longer than the foot, and it should have a stop at the ankle-joint hinge to prevent the toes being pointed. (Hoffti.) because there is no fixed point in the foot from which purchase can be taken; if the tendon be left undivided, a perfectly satisfactory point (Pappui is obtained. The plantar fascia is generally easily divided by putting the sole of the foot firmly upon the stretch, and dividing all the contracted bands by a tenotomy knife. It is best to commence the division as far back as is convenient. The patient is anaesthetised, and special care is taken in the disinfection; the anterior half of the foot is then grasped by the sur- geon's left hand and strongly abducted so as to make the fascia tense, whilst the tenotomy knife is introduced between the skin and the fascia about half an inch to one side of the most prominent tense band, and at about the same distance in front of the tuberosity of the os calcis. As soon as the

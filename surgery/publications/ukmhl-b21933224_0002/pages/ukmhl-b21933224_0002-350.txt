326 SURGICAL TREATMENT OF SPECIAL ANEURYSMS. carotid trunk. Its symptoms and course are similar to those of aneurysm elsewhere. The diagnosis is usually simple, but the affection requires to be distinguished from a tortuous condition of the artery, which is some- times met with close to the bifurcation, and sometimes it may be confounded with glands, tumours, or abcesses which lie over the vessel and receive pulsation from it. TREATMENT.—It is generally advisable to employ operative inter- ference, the exact operation depending of course upon the situation of the aneurysm. Digital compression of the artery has been tried, with success in some cases, but it is extremely difficult to perform effectually, and Fig. 105.—Method of applying Digital Compression to the Common Carotid. causes great pain to the patient. It can only be continued for quite a short time at each sitting—something like half an hour to an hour at a time—and must be carefully watched, as the pressure which must necessarily be also exerted upon the vagus is apt to give rise to serious cardiac symptoms. The pressure is made directly backwards by the fingers against the transverse processes of the fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae (see Fig. 105). Ligature.— (a) Proximal.—This is the best method to employ whenever it is feasible, which of course will be in all cases where the aneurysm is situated near the bifurcation. When, however, the aneurysm is situated near the origin of the vessel, the distal operation must be per-

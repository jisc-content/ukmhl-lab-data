CHAPTER XII. THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE LYMPHATIC GLANDS. WOUNDS. Wounds of lymphatic glands are rare and unimportant, and the treatment of them is merely that required for the wound in the soft parts; no special treatment is demanded by the wounded glands themselves. INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS. These may be divided into septic adenitis, acute and chronic; the various forms of venereal adenitis; and tuberculous disease of glands. ACUTE ADENITIS, with or without suppuration, is a very common affection, infective material being frequently transported by the lymphatic vessels to the glands from all sorts of injuries, and diseases of the skin. When this infective material contains pyogenic organisms, acute suppura- tion of the gland is very apt to follow. In these cases the gland, which is at first enlarged, reddish and firm, becomes soft and friable, and generally contains a number of foci of suppuration. Peri-adenitis rapidly occurs, the pus escapes through the capsule of the gland into the tissues around, and then, as in other acute abscesses, gradually spreads towards a free surface. When the abscess is opened, portions of the gland are usually found at the bottom of the wound, and if these be examined, independent foci of suppuration can often be seen in them. Symptoms.â€”The symptoms of acute adenitis are those of acute inflammation in general, with the addition of the local symptoms due to the affection of the glands; a single gland is usually affected at first, but later on others in the neighbourhood become enlarged, hard and painful, and, after a time, matted to the surrounding parts as a result of the peri- adenitis. If no suppuration occur, the pain generally subsides in the

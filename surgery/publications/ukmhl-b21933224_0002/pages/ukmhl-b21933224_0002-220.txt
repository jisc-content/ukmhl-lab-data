SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF BURS.E. 196 tubercle be found in it, it must be cleanly gouged out. The wound is then stitched up and an antiseptic dressing and pressure applied. In the case of the bursa iinder the deltoid, it is impossible to remove it entirely without a very extensive dissection. It is possible, how- ever, by means of an incision made along the anterior edge of the deltoid muscle, curving backwards at the lower part (see Fig. 71), to dissect away the greater part of the bursa as it lies beneath the muscle. The remainder must then be thoroughly scraped out, the rice bodies, if present, all removed, iodoform and glycerine emulsion injected, and the wound stitched up without a drainage tube. Tuberculosis of this bursa is generally secondary to tuberculous disease of the shoulder joint, and in that case, if the disease be extensive, it may be advisable to excise the joint. In such a case it is best to begin by dissecting away the bursa as completely as possible before proceeding to deal with the synovial membrane and the joint surfaces. This point will be dealt with more fully in speaking of diseases of joints. SYPHILIS. Syphilitic bursitis occurs in the secondary stage as an acute affection; in the tertiary stage it occurs as a gummatous deposit, but these lesions are rare, and the treatment does not require any special mention. TUMOURS. New growths in the walls of bursse are also rare. Sarcomata and myxomata are met with occasionally, and at first they are very difficult to distinguish from bursse, the walls of which are merely thickened by inflam- matory deposit. The treatment of course is essentially the same as that of new growths elsewhere, and consists in the complete removal of the tumour.

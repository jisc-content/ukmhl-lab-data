SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF NERVES. 264 ticular nerve operated upon. In the case of the sciatic, great force is required to produce rupture; roughly speaking the limb may be raised from Fig. 94.—Method of Stretching the Great Sciatic Nerve.—The sketch .shows the nerve being lifted well up by the fingers passed beneath it and firmly pulled upon. the table by pulling upon the nerve without fear of doing any damage. This corresponds to a pull of from thirty to sixty pounds, which is well within the limit of safety. The traction should be steady, and should be made in both directions, the peripheral end of the nerve being first pulled upon and afterwards the central; rather less force should be employed in the latter direction. It is common to feel bands of fibrous tissue giving way as the stretching is carried out, and at the end of the operation the nerve will often be found a good deal increased in length, so that it lies loose and flaccid in the wound. After the nerve has been stretched, it is replaced in the wound, all haemorrhage stopped, and the wound sewn up without the employment of a drainage tube. Special care must be taken to avoid any possibility of septic infection, as this would aggravate the neuritis already present The usual effect of the operation is to produce a temporary paralysis of the part supplied by the nerve, which is generally partial but which may be complete. This is often accompanied by perversion of sensa- tion, which gradually passes off as the function of the nerve becomes restored. After the wound has healed, friction, massage, and counter-irritation should be employed. Neurotomy.—When nerve-stretching has been employed in vain for neuritis of a sensory nerve from which the patient is suffering great agony, some further operative interference becomes necessary; this generally takes

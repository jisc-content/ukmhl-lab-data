33 CONTRACTIONS AFTER BURNS. uselessness of the hand. The burns are generally produced by grasping something red-hot, such as a poker, or falling on to the bars of a grate, and burning the palmar surface of the fingers. The result of this is a granulating wound which, when cicatrization is complete, gives rise to ridges of cicatricial tissue extending from the palmar surface of the tips of the fingers to the palm, the fingers becoming bent and rigid from the contraction of the scar. It is generally absolutely impossible to extend the affected fingers. TREATMENT.—The deformity is somewhat difficult to remedy. If the bands be simply divided transversely, recurrence of the contraction will almost inevitably occur as the wound heals, and the deformity will be reproduced. A transverse division of the cicatricial band, followed by immediate skin-grafting of the raw surface, also fails to give a satisfactory Fig. 22.—Operation for the rei-ief of contraction of a finger after a Burn.—W shows the incisions for raising the iater.il flaps; the portion between theni is cicatricial and is dissected out.

The best treatment, on the whole, is to dissect out the entire cicatrix in the skin and all the cicatricial tissue on the front of the finger, • and then to straighten the latter. This may be done as follows. An incision is carried from end to end of the finger upon each side of the central cicatrix, and as near to it as possible, and at each end the incision is curved outwards so that it nearly reaches the dorsum (see Fig. 22, A). In this way a flap is marked out on each side of the finger, and these are c

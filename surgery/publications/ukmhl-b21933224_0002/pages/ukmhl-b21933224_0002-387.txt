363 GLUTEAL ANEURYSM. Results.—Gangrene is not nearly so likely to occur after the old opera- tion for popliteal aneurysm as after ligature of the femoral artery high up, because the anastomosis is as a rule better. The anastomotica magna artery remains intact and serves to carry a large volume of blood to the articular arteries and the recurrent branches of the tibial. GLUTEAL ANEURYSM. This is not of common occurrence, and may be either spontaneous or traumatic—generally the latter. TREATMENT—The treatment will vary according to the position of the sac in reference to the pelvis. When the aneurysm is entirely outside the pelvis the old operation is the one to be recommended, and the artery should if possible be ligatured before the aneurysmal sac is opened. Should the aneurysm be inside the pelvis, or partly inside and partly outside it, the best treatment is ligature of the internal iliac vessel. It is very important before deciding upon the precise operation to make an examination per rectum or per vaginam in order to ascertain the exact position of the aneurysmal sac. Ligature of the Gluteal Artery.—This vessel emerges from the pelvis through the upper part of the great sacro-sciatic notch above the Fig. 135.—Ligature of the Right Gluteal Artery.— Q.Mx.

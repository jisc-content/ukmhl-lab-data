3l8 SURGICAL TREATMENT OF SPECIAL ANEURYSMS. pression of the abdominal aorta on the proximal side of the aneurysm is seldom feasible on account of the size and situation of the tumour, whilst distal compression has very rarely produced any beneficial result. Should it be decided to employ compression, the force used should not be more than is absolutely necessary to arrest the current of blood, and the pressure should not be continued for more than three or four hours at a time, nor renewed at more frequent intervals than three or four days. If these rules be neglected there is great risk of injury to the small intestine, where it is caught between the pad of the tourniquet and the vertebrae. The most convenient method of applying distal pressure to the abdominal aorta is by Lister's abdominal tourniquet (see Fig. loi). When the instru- ment is screwed down it causes considerable pain, and in all cases it will be necessary either to keep the patient fully under the influence of morphine or to administer chloroform, which need not be carried to the full surgical degree. The bowels should be freely cleared out for two or three days beforehand, and when the tourniquet is applied the abdominal muscles should be relaxed as much as possible by flexing the thighs upon the pelvis by large pillows placed under the knee, and by raising the thorax in the same way. The pad of the tourniquet is applied immediately below the aneurysm and a little to the left of the middle line. It is important to watch carefully the efl'ects produced by the use of this instrument. Should it be doing good, the aneurysm will be felt to become firmer and after a time somewhat smaller. On the other hand, intense pain, abdominal colic, and the passage of blood per rectum should be looked upon as indications for the immediate removal of the pressure.

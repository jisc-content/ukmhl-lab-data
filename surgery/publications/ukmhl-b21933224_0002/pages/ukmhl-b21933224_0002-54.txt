30 DEFORMITIES AFFECTING THE FINGERS AND TOES. beforehand as much as possible in the manner just described, it is thoroughly disinfected, and a vertical incision is made over the contracted band extending from the root of the finger (or further down, if necessary) to its upper limit, and then transverse incisions are made at each end of the vertical incision, so that the flaps of skin can be turned out on each side (see Fig. 20). If there are any marked horny indurations in the skin over the contracted band, they should be included in an elliptical incision, and removed at the same time. Considerable difficulty is often experienced in turning aside the skin over the contracted fascia if the Fig. 20.â€”Excision in Dupuytren's Contraction of the Palmar Fascia. The left-hand figure shows the incision made over the contracted band of fascia that is to be excised. In the right-hand figure (drawn to a larger scale), the flaps are shown turned aside, and the slips of contracted fascia requiring to be dissected out are seen. finger be much flexed, and in these cases it is a good plan to introduce a tenotomy knife before making the skin incision, and to sweep it between the skin and the fascia so as to separate the two structures from one another; this, however, should only be done in one or two places, and then very cautiously, because to a certain extent it endangers the vitality of the skin. After the flaps are turned aside the contracted band of fascia is dissected completely and cleanly out together with all the slips going to the fingers. Subsequently, by means of a tenotomy knife, the contracted ligaments around the joint may be divided if this should be found necessary in order to bring the finger straight. It is by no means easy to approximate the edges of the wound after the operation, especially when a portion of the skin has been excised.

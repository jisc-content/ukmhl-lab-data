CHAPTER XIII. THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF FASCIA. TRAUMATIC AFFECTIONS. RUPTURE.—This is the most important of the injuries of fasciae; for example, in the case of the foot, an overstretching or a sudden descent from a height on to the sole may lead to rupture of portions of the plantar fascia. The injury is accompanied by great pain at the time, and some- times imperfect union of the ruptured fascia may lead to a condition in which the foot is extremely tender whenever the patient bears his weight upon it. Treatment.—The main object of the treatment of this accident must be to ensure complete rest, so as to allow the ruptured fibres to unite. \Vhen the plantar fascia is ruptured the foot should be put up in plaster of Paris with the instep fully arched by bending the toes downwards as much as possible, so as to relax the fascia to the utmost extent. This casing should be kept on for about a fortnight; if it be kept on too long the fascia is apt to contract, and there may afterwards be difficulty in obtaining free extension of the foot. After the plaster is removed, care must be taken for some time to prevent any sudden strain or great weight being thrown upon the arch of the instep, so as to allow of perfect con- solidation taking place. The patient must therefore be cautioned against bearing too much weight upon it at first, and all heavy jars or strains must be avoided. CONTRACTIONS. Of diseases of fasciae the chief is the occurrence of various contractions. These may be the result of disease, such as gout; or may be due to repeated, long-continued, and severe pressure; or to prolonged immobiliza- tion of the limb in a faulty position. Of contractions of the fasciae due to disease the most marked example is that known as Dupujrtren's Con- traction of the palmar fascia, which is frequently associated with gout or rheumatism, and which has been already fully described (see p. 27).

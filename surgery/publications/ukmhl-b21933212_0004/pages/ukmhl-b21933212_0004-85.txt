53 SECTION II.—AFFECTIONS OF THE TONGUE AND FLOOR OF THE MOUTH. CHAPTER VI. CONGENITAL MALFORMATIONS, INJURIES, AND INFLAM- MATORY AFFECTIONS OF THE TONGUE. CONGENITAL AFFECTIONS. Congenital deformities of the tongue, such as deficiency, undue length, or a bifid condition of the organ, are very rare, as is also the congenital form of macroglossia ; these deformities are not amenable to surgical treatment. The form of macroglossia, due to lympliangioma, is considered in Chap. VIII. TONGUE-TIE. This condition, which is also known as anchyloglossia, is a congenital deformity in which the frenum linguse is abnormally short and the tongue cannot be protruded properly ; it generally improves as the child gets older, and seldom calls for treatment. TREATMENT.—Formerly the frenum was very frequently divided for supposed tongue-tie, but this is unnecessary in the majority of cases, as it gradually lengthens as the child gets older ; the operation, moreover, may be followed by a scar which may tie down the tip of the tongue and exaggerate the original trouble. In some cases, however, the frenum is extremely short and it is necessary to divide it. It should then be incised transversely close to the symphysis, so as to leave the portion beneath the tip of the tongue uninjured, and in bad cases it is well—after pulling up the tip of the organ and thus converting the original transverse incision into a lozenge-shaped space—to bring the sides of the latter together with one or two catgut

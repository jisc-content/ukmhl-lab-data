335 ACUTE INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION Fig. 123.—Acute kinking of the Intestine caused by THE traction of A Band. The traction produced enough kinking to give rise to complete obstruction. an opening in the diapliragm wliich is either congenital or may be the result of an injury. Internal liernige are exceedingly rare, and are about the last things to be looked for when the abdomen is opened on account of symp- toms of internal strangulation. Another condition whicli may give rise to similar symptoms is volvulus of the small intestine or the cceciiin. This is, however, rare as com- pared with volvulus of the sigmoid flexure. A condition that ma}^ also lead to similar symptoms is acute kinking of the boit'cl from contraction of a band (see Fig. 123) or from ad- hesions or compression of the gut by inflammatory matthig of the intestines (see Fig. 124). This condition is usuaUj^ more chronic in its onset and does not begin with the collapse and other acute symptoms characteristic of internal strangulation. Acute intussusception is another cause of these symptoms, but it differs very considerably in some respects from the foregoing forms of acute intestinal obstruction, and the majority of cases can be diagnosed before operation. It seems therefore more convenient to consider it separately (see Chap. XXIII.). There is still another group of causes of acute obstruction that require mention — namely, block- ing of the bowel by foreign bodies, of which the most common is a gall-stone. Here the symptoms are usuahy not so acute, the pain is not so great, and the other symptoms — especially the collapse in the early stages—are not so severe as in strangula- tion. The possibility of this occurrence must, how- ever, be borne in mind in operating for acute intestinal obstruction. Changes produced by the obstruction.—As a result of the constriction Fig. 124.—Intestinal Obstruction caused by a ' r up kink ' due to inflammatory adhesions.

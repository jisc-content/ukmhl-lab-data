EPITHELIOMA 87 easier to keep to the line of division originally decided upon than when contractile muscles are cut through with a knife or scissors, and in the second place the heat of the cautery destroys any cancer cells that may be near the line of excision. A broad flat cautery at a dull red heat should be used and the parts seared through slowly. Paquelin's cautery is preferable to the galvano-cautery or the galvanic ecraseur. The adjacent parts of the jaws and mouth must be protected from the heat. A preliminary laryngotomy is not necessary. These partial operations can only rarely be employed, but possibly they are not practised as frequently as they might be. Fig. 29, taken from the late Sir Henry Butlin's article on operations on the tongue in Fic. 29.—Incisions for Ri'moval of Small Growths from the Tongue. (Bullin.) the ' System of Operative Surgery,' vol. ii., shows how some of these partial operations can be done. (c) When the disease is fairly extensive, but is limited to one side of the tongue.—The great majority of these cases can be dealt with by an intra-buccal operation, provided that there is not much infiltration of the muscles of the tongue. The type of this operation is that formulated by Mr. Walter Whitehead, of Manchester, and commonly called by his name. Various surgeons have modified the steps of the operation, and we shall here describe the one we are accustomed to perform. It differs from Whitehead's original operation (which is described on p. go) merely in a few details. Operation.—The patient lies with the shoulders well raised on a

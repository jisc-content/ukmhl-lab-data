CHRONIC INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION 389 given in a pill combined with a little rlml)arb and nux vomica, as in the following prescription : Salol (ten grains in cachets three times a day) may be employed in the hope of diminishing the decomposition of the intestinal contents and thus lessening the poisoning of the patient. In the more chronic cases abdominal massage is of value. The diet must also be regulated ; substances leaving an insoluble residue should be avoided and the patient encouraged to drink plenty of fluid and take exercise. It is rarely necessary to consider the question of operation in this condition, except when a malignant growth complicates the fa;cal im- paction, but when there is an inveterate tendency to chronic accumulation of fseces in the large intestine the question of an ileo-sigmoid anastomosis or even excision of the colon may be considered. li Pulv. rhei.

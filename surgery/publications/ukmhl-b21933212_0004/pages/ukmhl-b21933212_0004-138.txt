AFFECTIONS OF THE TONGUE io6 to dissect off the glands may lead not only to rupture of the glands but also to a wound in the vein and bleeding, which may seriously interfere with the success of the operation. When the vein has been exposed below the glandular mass it is isolated, clamped in two places, and divided between the clamps. The lower end may then be ligatured, whilst the upper portion is pulled upwards and outwards, and the finger is gently insinuated between it and the artery and the vagus nerve, separating it Fig. 39.—Clearance of the Lateral Glandular Area of the Neck. The deep fascia is being dissected up below in order to expose the internal jugular vein. The fascia is divided along the dotted line along the anterior margin of the sterno-mastoid. The second dotted line shows the line of division along the depressors of the hyoid. The operation may be begun from below as shown above, or from above, when the fascia is detached from the ramus of the jaw and the submaxillary triangle cleared out first. —{Butlin, ' Diseases of the Tongue.' ) gradually upwards together with the whole mass of glands, fat and fascia. This separation is continued until the mass is free of the artery and the nerve, and it is carried as far forwards as the base of the sub- maxillary triangle and as far upwards as the parotid gland. The mass, with the finger in position behind it, is then lifted up and pushed well backwards, and the deep cervical fascia is divided with a knife from the base of the submaxillary triangle downwards along the outer edge of the depressors of the hyoid bone. This part of the operation will be accompanied by fairly free haemorrhage and several vessels may be

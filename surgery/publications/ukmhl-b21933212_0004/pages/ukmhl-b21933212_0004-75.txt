The eye is, of course, unaffected since the orbital plate is not interfered with. 4.

In other cases, however, the infection of the antral mucous membrane '1 Fig. 19.—Exposure of the Antral Cavity in Lateral Rhinotomy. The antral and nasal cavities are laid into one by the removal of the inner wall of the antrum and the inferior turbinal bone. may be more extensive, and require removal of the upper jaw, but here the question may arise whether it is not possible to leave the hard palate.

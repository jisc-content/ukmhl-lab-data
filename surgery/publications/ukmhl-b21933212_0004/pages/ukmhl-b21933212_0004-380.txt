AFFECTIONS OF THE INTESTINES 348 forty-eight hours. Another plan is to fix a Paul's tube into the opening in the bowel which was made to evacuate the contents of the loop and fasten it to the parietes, thus making a colostomy opening (see Fig. 129). It is also advisable to stitch the meso-sigmoid to the abdominal wall or to the iliac fascia. The stitches must not be introduced through the bowel wall as they might tear through and lead to perforation ; they must be passed through the outer layer of the meso-sigmoid without constricting the blood-vessels. If this does not suffice, the loop may be moored by the appendices epiploicse. Should it be impossible to untwist the volvulus, or should the mass be gangrenous, the outlook is exceedingly grave, for the surgeon has no alternative but to resect the entire massâ€”a procedure which is generally more severe than the patient can stand. To form an artificial anus in the loop does no good, because the affection is left untouched and the gangrene will proceed uninterruptedly. When, however, the patient cannot possibly stand the necessary resection, the best that can be done is to make an artificial anus both in the involved loop and in the colon above by the aid of Paul's tubes {vide supra). This, however, is very unlikely to succeed, and should only be done when it is impossible to do anything else.

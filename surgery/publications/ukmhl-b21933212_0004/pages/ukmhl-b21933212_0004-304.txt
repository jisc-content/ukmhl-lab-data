272 AFFECTIONS OF THE STOMACH point where the small intestine passes over the colon {vide infra). In this operation the contents (bile and pancreatic secretion) of the proximal or duodenal loop enter the jejunum well below the orifice in the stomach, whilst the gastric contents have no option but to travel in the right direction along the distal loop. Theoretically, this is a most satisfactory operation; practically, it is somewhat complicated and is apt to take a good deal of time and thus to be too severe unless the patient's condition is good. The simplest way to perform the operation is to proceed as for gastro- FiG. 100.â€”Anterior Gastro-jejunostomy. The figure shows the jejunum attached to the anterior surface of the stomach and the ' anti-l^inking ' sutures inserted after the anastomosis has been completed and the clamps removed. Four or five interrupted sero-muscular stitches are inserted after the jejunum has been arranged so as to lie in a bold curve on the stomach wall. jejunostomy up to the point at which the jejunum is identified. This structure is examined, and the spot at which its division is to be effected is selected. When the anastomosis is to be on the anterior surface of the stomach, this point will be about twelve inches from the duodeno-jejunal junction. The jejunum is now clamped above and below the proposed site of division of the bowel, at least six inches being left between the clamps, and the contents of the intestine being squeezed out before the clamps are applied. The jejunum is now cut cleanly across transversely to its long axis, or preferably slightly obliquely from above downwards from its convex to its mesenteric border, and the mesentery is also torn

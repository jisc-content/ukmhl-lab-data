In B the cord is hooked down out of the way and the lower edge of the internal ring is approximated behind it to Poupart's ligament, leaving just room enough for the cord to emerge at the outer end. In C the cord has been laid down in position and the cut edges of the external oblique sutured together over it, leaving just room for its emergence below.

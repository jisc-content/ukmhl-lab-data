PROLAPSE 583 employed if the entire thickness of the bowel wall has prolapsed. The patient is anaesthetised and' placed in the lithotomy position, and the parts are well protruded and the surface of the prolapse dried. Either fuming nitric acid or the actual cautery may be used. If nitric acid is employed, longitudinal lines are drawn on the mucous membrane from the margin of the anus to the apex of the protrusion. The acid is allowed to act for ten minutes, and is then neutralised by douching with a solution » i Fig. 196.—Method of Excising portions of a Prolapsus Ani. This shows dia- grammatically how the elhptical or diamond-shaped pieces are placed. The major portion consists of mucous membrane, tlie skin around the anus only furnishing a small part. The small diagram in tlie right-hand lower corner represents the prolapse looked at from above after removal of the portions of skin and mucous membrane. It shows how suture of these incisions not only provides longitudinal cicatrices but largely diminishes the bulk of the prolapse. of carbonate of soda. The protrusion is smeared with vaseline, and strips of muslin covered with ung. eucalypti are laid over the cauterised area, the protrusion is returned within the anus and kept up by a large pad fastened on by a T-bandage. A morphine suppository is introduced into the rectum and the bowels are kept confined for four days. A purge is then administered, and followed by suitable laxatives daily. The actual cautery is more effectual and more easily controlled than nitric acid ; it is applied in a similar manner, and care should be taken that it is only used at a dull red heat. The object of the cauterisation is to provide a series of vertical cicatrices around the bowel, which will contract

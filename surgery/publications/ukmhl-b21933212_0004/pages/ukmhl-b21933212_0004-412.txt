AFFECTIONS OF THE INTESTINES 38o same time to form a suitable spur, we employ one of the following methods, according to the necessities of the case. If the patient's condition is fair and the abdominal parietes not very fat, so that the bowel comes well out of the wound, we put in a mattress suture in the following manner. The skin is dissected back for a little distance, and a stout silk thread is passed through the rest of the abdominal wall near the upper end of the incision, then through the meso-sigmoid, and finally through the corresponding part of the abdominal wall on the opposite side. The needle, still threaded, is withdrawn and then made to traverse the several structures in a similar manner at the lower part of the wound (see Fig. 136). Fig. 136.—The Retaining Suture in Colostomy. The deep black line shows the musculo-peritoneal wall of the abdomen through which—and the mcso-colon —the suture passes. Above this are the skin and fat. When this suture is tied, the abdominal muscles are pressed against the sides of the bowel, and the suture passing behind the latter prevents it from slipping into the abdomen and at the same time helps to form a spur. Catgut sutures are inserted between the skin and the sero-muscular coat of the bowel. Some surgeons prefer to pass a rod of glass or ivory through the mesentery with its ends resting on the skin instead of em- ploying the stitch which has been just described. This method is specially of value when the patient's condition is critical and rapidity of operating essential. One or two supports may be employed according to the necessities of the case ; if the latter number, they should be about an inch apart. With an abdominal wound of suitable size, these pegs hold the bowel immovably in position and no stitches are required. We have lately

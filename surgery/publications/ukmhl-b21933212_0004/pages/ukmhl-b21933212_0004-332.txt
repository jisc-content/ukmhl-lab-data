CHAPTER XIX. 300 CANCER OF THE STOMACH. Benign growths may occur in the stomach, but they are usually mere pathological curiosities, and the diagnosis is rarely made without an exploratory laparotomy. The simple tumours met with have been generally myomata or fibromataâ€”the former being the more common. They must be removed if possible. The most common malignant tumour of the stomach is undoubtedly a carcinoma. Sarcoma of the stomach, although occasionally met with, is of extreme rarity. Carcinoma of the stomach is not an uncommon form of malignant disease, about 2 per cent, of all deaths from cancer occurring from this affection. Men and women appear to be affected in equal proportions ; the disease is most common between forty and sixty years of age, and is said to be more prevalent in the tropics than in temperate climates. It is almost invariably a primary lesion, but is sometimes secondary to carcinoma of the oesophagus, pharynx, or breast. The neighbourhood of the pylorus is the most common situation of the affection, about 60 per cent, of all cases starting in that region, and it often seems to arise on a pre-existing ulcer of the stomach. The growth is usually a cylindrical epithelioma with marked colloid degeneration, and it spreads to a remarkable extent in the coats of the stomach, especially along the lesser curvature. The lymphatic glands are affected comparatively early, the first involved being those along the lesser curvature and those running up towards the liver. Before long, however, the glands in the omentum and about the pancreas enlarge, and the latter is a point of great practical importance, as glands in this situation are extremely difficult to remove satisfactorily. The disease may involve the liver, spleen, or pancreas by direct continuity, and occasionally the case terminates by a general cancerous infection of the peritoneum. The symptoms will vary according to whether or not there is ob- struction to the passage of food.

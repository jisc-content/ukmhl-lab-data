AFFECTIONS OF THE (ESOPHAGUS 164 different lengths and diameters, so as to suit patients of various ages, and they are provided with a conical obturator which serves as an introducer. By means of a watch-spring attached to the upper end, the inner tube can be protruded for a variable distance through the outer. Both tubes are graduated in centimetres so that the exact distance of the instrument from the teeth can be read off. A handle is fixed to the outer tube for the attachment of a Briining's hand-lamp, which is constructed so as to throw a beam of parallel rays down the tube and thus give a maximum of illumination. The lamp can be moved to the right and left, or raised so as to avoid interference with the passage of instruments down the tube. Fig. 58.—CEsoPHAGOscoPE Tubes and Forceps. The tube, C, which is made in varying sizes, is inserted with the obturator, A, inside it. B is the inner tube which is inserted after removal of the obturator, as shown in Z) ; it can be projected a considerable distance beyond the end of the tube, C, by means of the watch- spring attached to its upper end. £ is a pair of oesophageal forceps for removal of foreign bodies. Special forceps which can be lengthened and which are provided with detachable jaws for the removal of different kinds of foreign bodies are necessary (see Fig. 58). Dr. William Hill has introduced an elliptical instrument of much larger diameter with a slit extending the whole length of one side of the tube ; the tube tapers from the proximal to the distal end. The increased calibre of the tube enables larger forceps to be used, and the lateral slit allows a tube containing radium to be more readily introduced into a cancerous stricture. In children a general aucesthetic is necessary. In adults, local anaesthesia produced by the application of a 10 per cent, solution of cocaine to the pharynx, the aperture of the larynx, and the region behind

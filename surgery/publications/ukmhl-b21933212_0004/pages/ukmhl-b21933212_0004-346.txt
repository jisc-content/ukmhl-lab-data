CHAPTER XXL INJURIES OF THE INTESTINES, THE OMENTUM, AND THE MESENTERY. These injuries closely resemble those of the stomach, and only the special points relating to them need be considered in detail. The effects of the injury differ according as it is caused by a sharp or a blunt instrument, and the two important results which may be produced are bleeding and injury to the intestinal wall. Severe and often fatal hcEinoyrhage may occur from the omentum or the mesentery as the result of an external injury, while the intestine itself may escape. The lesion in the omentum or mesentery may vary from a simple longitudinal tear rupturing only one or two vessels, to an extensive laceration, or even detachment of the mesentery from the spine or from the bowel ; in the latter case very serious secondary in- testinal troubles may result from the injury to the blood-supply of the bowel if the patient survives long enough. On opening the abdomen after an injury and finding blood, the surgeon must bear in mind that there are various other and more probable sources of the haemorrhage than injury of the omentum or mesentery, and he must more especially examine the liver and spleen. As the result of an external injury, partial or complete rupture of some portion of the intestinal canal may occur. The parts most frequently affected are the jejunum and the ileum ; but in severe crushes, as when a heavy cart passes over the abdomen, the more fixed portions of the intestine, such as the duodenum and the ascending or descending colon, suffer most. The injury may vary from a simple contusion to an exten- sive laceration or complete division of the intestine ; the injuries may be limited to one coil of bowel or they may be multiple. As a rule they are more often multiple in penetrating wounds than in contusions ; the possibility of multiple injuries must be borne in mind when the abdomen is opened for the purpose of investigating cases of this kind.

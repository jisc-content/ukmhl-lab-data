TREATMENT OF IRREDUCIBLE HERNIA. A simple irreducible hernia is generally due to the presence of adhesions between the contents of the sac and its wall, but it may be due to increase in size of the contents after they have been in the sac for some time. In the great majority of cases irreducibility is due to the presence of omentum, which becomes adherent to the wall of the sac as the result of the application of a truss over an imperfectly reduced hernia, or which increases in size either as the result of the Fig. 154.—Wood's Horseshoe Pad.

Rarer causes are the presence of some viscus, such as the caecum, in the sac. In all cases of irreducible hernia it is advisable to perforin a radical cure, unless there is some definite contra-indication. No form of truss will keep up the hernia, and therefore the patient is liable at any time to the occurrence of strangulation. If a truss is applied over an irreducible hernia with the view of preventing the descent of fresh portions of bowel or omentum, it causes irritation of the omentum which is not reduced, and may set up inflammation ; in any case it makes the condition worse. The only kind of truss that is permissible in these cases is a hollow or bag truss (see Fig. 155), and this is rarely of much use as it is difficult to adapt it to the mass which it has to support. The object of operation under these circumstances may be either to obtain a true radical cure or merely to enable the patient to wear a truss ; the operation should be more strongly pressed than in reducible

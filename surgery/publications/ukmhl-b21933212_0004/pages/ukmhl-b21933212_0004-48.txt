AFFECTIONS OF THE JAWS i6 INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS. The temporo-mandibular articulation may be the seat of various inflammatory conditions, which cause considerable trouble from in- terference with mastication and articulation. Among them may be mentioned: acute rheumatism ; gonococcal arthritis, which is fairly frequently met with ; suppurative arthritis, resulting from a wound of the joint, from some septic focus in the immediate neighbourhood, or as a part of a general pyaemic condition ; osteo-arthritis ; and sometimes, though very rarely, tuberculous disease. TREATMENT.—The treatment of these conditions differs in no essential respect from the treatment of similar affections in other joints* A B. Fig. 6.—Gags for Anchylosis of the Jaws. A is the conical screw-gag of boxwood. B, the powerful metal form. It is, however, important to remember that the stiffness which is apt to result from any inflammatory affection of the articulation may cause considerable trouble to the patient subsequently, from impaired mobility and inability to separate the teeth. This is especially apt to occur after rheumatic or gonococcal arthritis. Movements of the jaw should therefore be commenced as soon as the inflammation has passed off, and, if necessary, adhesions should be broken down under an anaesthetic, the administration of which, in cases of closed jaw, however, requires great care. When there is much tendency to contraction, the best plan is to employ some form of gag to keep the teeth apart. A conical boxwood gag or a double wedge provided with a screw arrangement so as gradually to increase the separation between the teeth (see Fig. 6) may be used.

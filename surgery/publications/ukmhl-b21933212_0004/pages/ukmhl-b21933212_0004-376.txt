AFFECTIONS OF THE INTESTINES 344 a syphon arrangement; or a smaller india-rubber tube may be intro- duced through the open end of the glass one and may be pushed into the coils of intestine above, or an attempt may be made to suck out the contents of the bowel with an evacuator. The surgeon must be satisfied that the contents of the upper portion of the intestine are escaping freely before he leaves the patient. The ring of intestine constricted by the suture round the Paul's tubes usually sloughs in about three days and then both the tubes become loose and must be removed. By that time sufficiently firm adhesions Fig. 127.—^Temporary Intestinal Drainage after Enterectomy for acute Obstruction. A portion of the bowel has been resected and a lateral anastomosis established. The end of the distal portion of the bowel has been invaginated and closed, while into the open end of the proximal portion a Paul's tube has been tied in order to ensure proper drainage of the intestinal contents. have occurred to prevent the entrance of the contents into the abdominal cavity and there is little risk of septic infection. When the patient has recovered, the closure of the artificial anus must be undertaken (see Chap. XXXI.). When the opening is in the small intestine this must be done comparatively early, for two reasons : in the first place, because nutrition may be seriously interfered with by the escape of the contents of the small intestine, and in the second place, because these contents are very irritating and cause excoriation of the abdominal wall. After-treatment of cases of acute intestinal obstruction.—Little need be said about the after-treatment of these cases, as it does not differ in any

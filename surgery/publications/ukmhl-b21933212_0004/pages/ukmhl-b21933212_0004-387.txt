355 ACUTE INTUSSUSCEPTION that described by Mr. Barker—namely, local resection of the intus- suscepted portion through an incision in the ensheathing layer.i The tumour is reduced as far as possible and is then brought out of the abdomen, and intestinal clamps are applied above and below it. A continuous Lembert suture is made to unite the entering to the ensheath- ing layer all round the neck of the tumour. The intussuscipiens is then incised over tlie tumour and the intussusceptum pulled out through the opening. The forefinger of the left hand is now thrust up its lumen to serve as a guide for the stout transfixion stitches which are to unite all the coats firmly together. These are very quickly introduced Fig. 131.—Removal of the Intussusceptum by Barker's Method. Two of tht- four transfixion sutures are shown held in forceps. The dotted line represents the portion of the intussusceptum and the reflected layer that is cut off. The suture is shown in position about the neck of the intussusceptum, and the cut edges of the intus^ susceptum and the reflected layers are bein;^ united by a through-and-through suture. by thrusting a threaded ngevus needle completely through the intus- susceptum from side to side as near the neck as possible ; a second needle is passed in a similar manner, but at right angles to the first. Then the entire intussusceptum is cut off just below the level of the sutures (see Fig. 131). The loops of the threads as they pass across the lumen of the bowel are puUed out and divided, and thus four sutures, each of which traverse all the coats of the intussusceptum and the reflected layer of the sheath, are formed. These sutures are then tied and keep the two portions of bowel firmly in apposition.

Gastro-duodenostomy.—Several surgeons—notably Kocher—have advocated gastro-duodenostomy in preference to gastro-jejunostomy in all cases in which it is possible, on the grounds that it affords a more Fig. 103.—Method of preventing narrowing of the Stomach after Excision OF A large Gastric Ulcer. A shows the method of converting an ellipse with its long axis parallel to the curvature of the stomach into a cicatrix at right angles to this by means of mattress sutures. In B the row of sutures is inserted preparatory to being buried by a continuous Lembert stitch. direct exit for the stomach contents and that it avoids the risk of peptic ulcer and the ' vicious circle.'

The essential point is to free the descending part of the duodenum sufficiently to enable it to be brought forward to the anterior surface of the stomach. Kocher does this by dividing the peritoneum about two fingers' breadth to the right of the duodenum, curving the incision round below until the vessels supplying the transverse colon are reached, and then lifting forward the

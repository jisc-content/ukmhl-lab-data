FOREIGN BODIES 163 point is at the cardiac orifice of the stomach. A preliminary injection of morphine or a dose of chloral greatly diminishes the pain and spasm. Fig. 56.—Coin-catcher and Probang combined. The lower portion is the ?ponge-probang, the upper the coin-catcher. Although extremely useful for the cases we have just mentioned, the method should never be employed for bodies which markedly distend the oesophagus, such as large coins, or for objects which have sharp angles or hooks, as severe lacera- tion of the oesophageal wall is apt to result, and a foreign body previously impacted in some acces- sible region may become fixed in the oesophagus low down and out of reach of safe operative interference. Extraction through the mouth.—When the foreign body is small (such as a fish-bone, a needle, a coin, a tin-tack, or a portion of bone), attempts must be made to extract it through the mouth. This can be done by means of the oesophagoscope (see Fig. 57), which enables the surgeon to see the foreign body and seize it with suitable forceps. The oesophagoscope and the method o£ using it.—The oesophagoscope consists of an outer tube or spatula into which Fig- 57-— CEsophagoscope with BrDning's' Lamp. The various portions of the oesophagoscope are shown in more detail in the following ligure. The sketch above shows the arrangement of the handle and the lamp. The latter is focussed by sliding the arm (I) m the handle (k). The light is reflected down the tube from a mirror m the hood (f). This hood is on a pivot at f' so that it can be swung back to enable instruments to be passed down the tube an inner tube fits. The tub es are made of M 2

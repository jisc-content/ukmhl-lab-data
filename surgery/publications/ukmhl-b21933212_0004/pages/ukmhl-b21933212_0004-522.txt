AFFECTIONS OF THE INTESTINES 490 the canal is undertaken if necessary. In some cases we simply stitch up the external oblique tendon and narrow the external ring, leaving just sufficient room for the cord to pass (see Fig. 165, C). In other cases we adopt measures to narrow the canal, as above described, by mattress sutures. When we employ mattress sutures we pass one end of the stitch beneath Poupart's ligament and one through it, and thus obtain a stronger hold. It is most important to see that nothing but the con- joined tendon is taken up when passing the innermost sutures ; the bladder has been perforated by the suture when the posterior surface Fig. 166.â€”Method of dealing with the Neck of the Sac after Ligature. The ends of the ligatures upon the neck of the sac are threaded in turn upon a nsevus needle and carried through the abdominal wall as shown in the figure. When the two threads, which are brought out close together, are tied, the neck of the sac is drawn up well above and to the outer side of the internal ring (see also Fig. 162). of the conjoined tendon has been imperfectly cleared. The external oblique is then united by interrupted sutures, the external ring being diminished in size to any required extent. All bleeding points are now secured by ligature, and the flap is stitched up with a continuous suture. In very fat subjects we put a small drainage tube in the upper angle of the wound for two days ; in the great majority no drain is necessary. The bandage is a double spica. If the dressing becomes soiled or there is much bleeding, the dressing must be changed next day, otherwise it need not be disturbed for a week unless a drainage tube has been inserted; in that case the tube is left out on the second day. To prevent the dressing being soiled with urine in the male, we take

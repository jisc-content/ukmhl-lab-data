524 AFFECTIONS OF THE RECTUM AND ANUS unless and until the inflation has opened up a way for it; this is ascer- tained by direct vision, and the necessary deflection of the instrument can be judged to a nicety. When the examination is at an end, the eyepiece is removed and the air allowed to escape as the tube is slowly withdrawn. In skilled hands no harm results from the use of this instrument, and a little practice soon renders the observer able to mani- pulate it easily, provided that he never uses force. It is made in several sizes, including small ones suitable for children or for passing through strictures in order to ascertain their length and the condition of the bowel beyond them. In addition to this physical examination, careful inquiries must be made as to the character of the stools, the existence and nature of discharges from the rectum, the occurrence of any protrusion during defaecation, and various other pointsâ€”all of which are dealt with in connection with the individual affections.

CHAPTER XX. 310 DUODENAL ULCER : JEJUNAL ULCER. DUODENAL ULCER. Ulcer of the duodenum first attracted attention in connection with burns, and in these cases is supposed to be due to some toxic con- dition in connection with the septic state of the wound. The ulcer is generally in the first part of the duodenum, and most often above the entrance of the bile-duct. Hemorrhage not infrequently results, and sometimes perforation. Uraemic and tuberculous ulcers have also been described. The condition to which we refer in this chapter is, however, the chronic duodenal ulcer, which is not at all uncommon and which in its characters and probably in its origin is closely allied to the chronic gastric ulcer. The great majority of these ulcers are situated in the first part of the duodenum, and occur most often in men about middle life. The symptoms, which have been especially worked out by Moynihan, are as follows : There is often a history of weight and distension in the epigastrium after meals, to which very little attention is paid, but later the patient begins to notice that pain, which is often very severe, comes on two hours or more after food, or earlier if the diet is fluid. It is relieved by taking food ; Moynihan has therefore given the name of ' hunger pain ' to this symptom. Vomiting is rai-e. The symptoms are not constantly present, but come on in attacks, most often in winter. Heartburn or pyrosis is not uncommon. Little or nothing may be made out on examination, but in some cases there may be tenderness in the middle line, combined with some rigidity and increased refle.x of the upper part of the right rectus. Haemorrhage is a common complication of duodenal ulcer and its presence is a very strong point in favour of the diagnosis. It may be present in large amount, giving the characteristic melasna, but in many

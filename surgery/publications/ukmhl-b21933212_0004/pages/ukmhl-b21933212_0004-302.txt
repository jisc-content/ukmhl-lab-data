AFFECTIONS OF THE STOMACH 270 reaches the extreme left-hand end of the anastomosis, the two ends of the suture are tied together and the union should be water-tight. As this deeper suture is introduced, each loop of it is pulled fairly tight so that it shall be effectually haemostatic. There are, however, often three or four small bleeding points that it is well to ligature, especially in the jejunum, and we have always found it an excellent precaution against serious post- operative bleeding to relax each limb of the clamp separately before the anterior part of this deep haemostatic suture is inserted and again before it is completed, as this enables an uncontrolled vessel to be recognised and ligatured. As soon as the deep suture has been inserted and tied, the joint is Fig. 99.—Posterior Gastro-jejunostomy. Completing the outer layer of suture. When the. suture is brought to the right-hand end of the anastomosis the two ends are tied together. The clamp is relaxed to facilitate the drawing together of the serous surfaces. water-tight and the clamps and the posterior packing are removed. This greatly facilitates the next step—namely, the completion of the external suture, the ends of which have been left long and caught in forceps. This takes up the adjacent sero-muscular surfaces about a quarter of an inch external to the deep sutiire just inserted (see Fig. 99). When this suture has reached the left side, the two ends are tied together and cut short. The continuous suture uniting all the coats is thus completely buried. If the sides of the opening in the gastro-colic omentum have not been already fixed, this should now be done. Lastly the packing is removed and the abdominal wall is closed in the usual way by suturing it in layers (see p. 216); and if the patient is collapsed, it is well to fill up the abdominal cavity with as much hot normal saline solution (105° F.) as it will hold

CANCER 603 so that the pelvis rests upon the sand-bag ; at the same time the left side is raised by a smaller sand-bag under the left anterior superior spine. The knees hang over the end of the tabh and rest upon a chair, whilst the foot of the table is raised so as to carry the intestines away from the pelvis. Another method of doing the same thing is to suspend the pelvis over a strap passed beneath it so that the patient is almost in the genu- pectoral position. It is important to arrange the patient so that there shall be no diffiiculty in breathing ; a pillow should, therefore, be put under the chest so that the abdominal muscles can work freely. The parts are shaved and disinfected, and a median incision is made Fig. 204.â€”Line of Division of the Sacrum in Excision of the Rectum. The line of bone section runs just below the third sacral foramina. The coccyx is also removed. from just behind the anus to the middle of the sacrum ; the anus is closed by sutures before the operation is begun. The soft parts are raised from the coccyx, which is disarticulated and removed. The fat and fascia covering the levatores ani are then divided in the middle line throughout the whole length of the wound and the incision is deepened until the tissues outside the anal canal are reached. The levatores ani are now divided close to their insertion into the rectum, and, by pushing the fingers upwards behind the rectum, the tumour can be felt and its limits ascertained ; it is now possible to determine how much of the sacrum must be taken away. If necessary, the posterior surface of the sacrum is cleared, the muscles and ligaments separated on either side, and the periosteum peeled off the front of the bone. The bone is removed with a chisel along a line drawn transversely below the third sacral foramina (see Fig. 202).

584 AFFECTIONS OF THE RECTUM AND ANUS on healing, and shorten the structures in the vertical direction, so as to pull up the prolapse. Both methods may be followed by a painful and protracted convalescence. Excision of portions of the prolapse.—When the protrusion is large, portions of the mucous membrane of the prolapse and the skin around the anus may be excised, so as not only to diminish the size of the protruded mass, but also to lessen the calibre of the anus, and so form a barrier to the escape of the bowel. This may be done by excising four to six diamond-shaped portions around the anus (see Fig. 196), one part of each diamond con- sisting of mucous membrane and the other of the skin around the anus. The long axes of the portions removed are parallel to the long axis of the bowel. Generally speaking, a larger amount of the mucous membrane than of the skin is removed, but this will vary according to the laxity of the sphincter. The portions to be removed are marked out with a knife, and are then dissected up from the submucous and subcutaneous tissues respectively ; the sides of the incisions thus formed are sutured together so as to convert them into longitudinal Fig. 197.-Exc1s.ON OP A Prolapse o. the Rectum.

Catgut sutures should be employed for the mucous membrane, whilst silkworm-gut serves for the approximation of the skin. A suppository is inserted, the prolapse reduced, and a pad of lint applied outside the anus. The after-treatment is the same as for the simpler cases (see p. 583). Only the silkworm-gut sutures will require removal. Excision of the entire prolapse,—^The method just described is suitable for cases in which only the mucous membrane and not the entire wall of

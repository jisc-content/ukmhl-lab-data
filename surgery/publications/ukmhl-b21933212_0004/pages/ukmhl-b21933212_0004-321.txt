GASTRIC ULCER 289 one, thereby increasing the vertical diameter of the pyloric ring (see Fig. 106). The abdomen is opened slightly to the right of the middle line in the usual manner (see p. 215) and the pylorus brought as far up into the wound as possible and packed off with abdominal cloths. An intestinal clamp is applied to the duodenum as far on the distal side of the proposed B Fig. 106.—Pyloroplasty. In A is shown the method of clamping the duodenum by a Lane's clamp—which is shown in more detail in Fig. 107—on the left-hand, and the stomach by rubber-sheathed forceps on the right-hand side ; these forceps are shown in B. The longitudinal incision is marked out along the narrowed pylorus, and this incision is converted into one that has its long axis at right angles to that of the pylorus by a mattress suture. The row of mattress sutures is buried by a continuous sero-muscular stitch. The calibre of the pylorus is relatively much enlarged. incision as possible, the loop of bowel being squeezed empty of its contents before it is applied. The pyloric end of the stomach should also be clamped (see Fig. io6). An incision is then made in the anterior wall of the stomach about half an inch from the pylorus, and carried horizontally through that structure for about half an inch on to the duodenum. If there is much contraction it may be difficult to hit off the passage through the pylorus, and under these circumstances it is best to open the stomach just in front of the pylorus, then pass a probe through the latter into the IV. u

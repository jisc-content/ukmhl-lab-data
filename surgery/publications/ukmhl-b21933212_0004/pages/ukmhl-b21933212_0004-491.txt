459 CHAPTER XXIX HERNIA: GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. By the term ' hernia ' is meant a protrnsion of the contents of a cavity thronglr its wall, and this may occiu^ either through dilated natural openings or through parts weakened by injury or disease. We shall here deal only with al)dominal hernia. Constituents of a hernia.—A hernia is made up of a sac, with contents and coverings. The great majority of abdominal herniae possess a sac formed from the peritoneum, while in very exceptional cases there may be no sac ; among the latter are herniae of the caecum and the bladder. The sac may exist previous to the descent of the hernia or it may be formed as the hernia comes down. An example of tlie former condition is the open funicular process in congenital inguinal hernia ; in this form the contents pass into a canal which remains patent from foetal life. In acquired herni^e the presumption is that the peritoneum is pushed through the weak part of the wall by the contents of the abdomen and forms the sac. Some surgeons deny the existence of acquired sacs and hold that they are all congenital, and only enlarge as the hernia develops, but this view is not generally accepted. In the early stages the sac is composed of the thin peritoneum, but in long-standing cases it may be much thickened ; the most marked changes occur at its neck, which may become rigid and narrow instead of being distensible. Sometimes the fundus of the sac also shows constrictions, and in operating for strangulated hernia it is important not to mistake a constriction ot this kind for the true neck of the sac. Occasionally a double sac—or rather a diverticulum from the main one—is met with, and after herniotomy the contents of the lower portion of such a sac may be reduced into the up])er instead of into the abdomen, and the strangulation thus be left unrelieved. A hernial sac once formed is not reducible ; when a hernia is reduced

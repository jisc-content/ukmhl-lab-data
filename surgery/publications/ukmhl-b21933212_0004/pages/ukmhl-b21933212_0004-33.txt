DIVISION I. THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE JAWS AND TONGUE. SECTION I.—AFFECTIONS OF THE JAWS. CHAPTER I. FRACTURES OF THE JAWS. FRACTURE OF THE UPPER JAW. Fractures of the maxilla are nearly always due to violence applied directly to it, although in some cases the fracture may extend from the skull. "VARIETIES.—Fracture of the alveolar margin is not uncommon ; it may be produced by severe blows, such as a kick from a horse, and may lead to detachment of the entire alveolus together with the hard palate. In other cases the fracture is limited to a small portion of the alveolar border, as sometimes happens after the extraction of teeth. The nasal process may also be fractured by direct violence, and is often accompanied by injury to the lachrymal sac or nasal duct; emphysema is common in connection M'ith it. Fracture of the anterior wall of the antrum may be due to blows, or to stabs or bullet wounds; in the latter case the fracture is compound. Fractures of the palatal process alone are very rare, and are generally the result of gunshot wounds or direct blows, such as bayonet wounds. Extensive fracture of the whole bone or of both bones together is usually only part of some very serious injury, being generally associated with fracture of the base of the skull. IV. B

383 CHRONIC INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION is inserted. If this is employed, it must be borne in mind that if the second operation is performed too soon after the first, the act of tightening the ligature may detach the soft adhesions and leave a communication with the peritoneal cavity. After ten days, however, the adhesions are firm enough to resist this. In performing colostomy for cancer of the rectum, a good many surgeons are abandoning the oblique incision for a more central one Fig. 140.—Collier's ati-araius in ush. In the left-hand hsure the neeJle D has been inserted into the lumen of the bowel. The india-rubber sleeve C is turned back and the glass tube B is about to bo placed over the upper spiral of the needle. In tile right-hand figure this has been done, the india-rubber sleeve C turned down so as to grip the lower spiral of the needle through the bowel wall and the thin rubber tube A has been attached to the opposite end of the glass tube B—after an incision has been made into the bowel—so as to convey away the intestinal contents. through the left rectus nuiscle; but this is not very suitable when actual obstruction is present, as it may be necessary to get at the upper part of the sigmoid flexure or the descending colon, and for that purpose a fresh lateral incision would be required, while with the oblique method it is only necessary to extend the incision upwards and backwards. Here, as in the right-sided colostomy, the primary object of the operation is to save life, but, when the obstruction has passed off, it may be thought advisable to attempt to remove the disease or to make an

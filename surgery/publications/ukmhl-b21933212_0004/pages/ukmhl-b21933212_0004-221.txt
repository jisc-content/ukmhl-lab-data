CARCINOMA 189 portion of the stomach wall embracing the catheter with a few Lembert's sutures introduced at some little distance to either side of the tube or else by a purse-string suture of stout catgut or silk some distance away from it (see Fig. 71). As these sutures are drawn tight, the catheter and the stomach surrounding it are pushed downwards so that the lower end of the catheter is surrounded for an inch or more by a collar of stomach which projects downwards like a nipple into the interior of the viscus (see Fig. 72). This invagination can be made more pronounced, if the stomach be of sufficient size, by carrying another purse-string suture or a second layer of Lembert sutures still further out. The opening in the stomach is now brought immediately under that in the abdominal wall and the viscus is fixed firmly to the latter by four or six sutures (see Fig. 73) ; the wound is then closed. The after-treatment is similar to that after Witzel's method. When the catheter is taken out, the nipple-like projection into the interior of the stomach prevents regurgitation of the stomach contents. Franck's operation.—The stomach is exposed as before and as much of its anterior wall is pulled out through the abdominal wound as will come without exerting undue traction. This is given to an assistant to hold whilst the surgeon makes a second vertical incision about an inch long just below the costal margin (see Fig. 74). This only goes through the skin, fascia, and anterior layer of the sheath of the rectus, and this and the original wound are connected by carrying the handle of the knife horizontally through the fibres of the rectus from one to the other ; this forms a canal with a muscular band surrounding it.

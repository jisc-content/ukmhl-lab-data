AFFECTIONS OF THE TONGUE 72 case if it extends deeply into the base of the tongue and gives rise to much enlargement there, it will be advisable to give the patient a general anaesthetic, and then either perform a preliminary laryngotomy and plug the pharynx, or have the head hanging well down so that any blood will collect in the naso-pharynx. The tongue is pulled well forwards by means of a cUp or tongue-forceps, and an elliptical incision is made through the mucous membrane of the tongue enclosing the base of the tumour, but not incising it. Good reflected light or a powerful forehead lamp is required, as the tumour must not be injured. Then, with a blunt dissector, the growth can be shelled out without serious bleeding, and the cavity which is left should be obliterated by a few catgut sutures inserted deeply so as to arrest bleeding and secure coaptation. Should myxoedema ensue, the patient must be treated by means of thyroid extract (see Vol. V.). PAPILLOMATA. Warts are not uncommon on the tongue, and are important mainly because they may be foUowed by epithelioma. They are usually pedun- culated and occur on the dorsum ; they nicLy also be met with beneath the tongue in the neighbourhood of the frenum. The warty condition of the tongue associated with leucoma is referred to on p. 58 ; in that condition the warts are usually sessile and are very liable to be followed by epithelioma. TREATMEHSTT.â€”Removal is imperative and is usually easy. The best method is to enclose the base of the wart in an elliptical incision carried into the substance of the tongue in a wedge-shaped manner, so as to allow the edges of the wound to be stitched together with catgut afterwards. This operation is best performed under general anaesthesia, but local anaesthesia by cocaine, applied both locally to the surface and injected into the tongue, may be employed ; the objection to it is the difficulty of controlling the movements of the tongue.

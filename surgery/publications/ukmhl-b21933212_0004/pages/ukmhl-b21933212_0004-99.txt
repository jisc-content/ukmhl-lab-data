TUBERCULOSIS 67 and this may be done without a general anaesthetic, although the use of one is more satisfactory. The ulcer is mopped over with a 10 per cent, solution of cocaine (to which a few drops of adrenalin chloride are added), and its surface is carefully scraped with a small sharp spoon, and afterwards sponged over with undiluted carbolic or lactic acid (see Vol. III. p. 463). This may be repeated if necessary at intervals until healthy granulation occurs. A mouth-wash of boro-glyceride or sanitas may be used after the operation ; one of alum or tannin (gr. ij-v to the oz.) should be substituted if healing is slow. The constitutional treatment of tuberculous disease (see Vol. I. p. 231) should be carried out. When the ulcer is too extensive or the patient is too weak for this treatment, the surface of the ulcer may be painted over with a 20 per cent, solution of lactic acid every alternate day. If the pain is very severe orthoform may be powdered on the ulcer shortly before meals, so as to relieve the pain. Should this fail, the local application of a 10 per cent, solution of cocaine should be prescribed. As an alternative in severe cases, a sixth of a grain of morphine mixed with a little boric acid may be dusted on the ulcer after its surface has been dried.

X PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION to time been proposed: to do so would merely confuse the reader. Only those plans are described which our experience has led us to believe are the best, but with regard to these we have endeavoured to state exactly and in detail what we ourselves should do under given circum- stances. In some cases no doubt several methods of treatment are of equal value, and while we have discussed at length that which we have ourselves been led to adopt, we have referred shortly to the others.^. We have not mentioned all the exceptional conditions that may be met with, but we have endeavoured to include aU the circumstances with which the surgeon is most commonly called upon to deal. The task has been one of some difficulty, the more so as we have had, to a certain extent, to break new ground. This must serve as our excuse for the many shortcomings in the work. London, April, 1899.

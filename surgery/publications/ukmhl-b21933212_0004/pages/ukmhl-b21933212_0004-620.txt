588 CHAPTER XLIL NEW GROWTHS OF THE RECTUM. POLYPUS. Polypi are generally met with in children, in the lower two inches of the bowel, although they occasionally occur higher up ; the majority are adenomata, and are pedunculated, owing to the traction they exert during defcecation. Myomata, fibromata, and lipomata occur, but they are very rare ; warty villous tumours and cysts have also been met with. A diffuse polypoid condition of the mucous membrane may also affect the whole of the large bowel from the anus to the ileo-ceecal valve. The diagnosis is easy when the tumour is situated near the anus; there is tenesmus, accompanied by the passage of mucus and blood, and the tumour may protrude through the anus during defeecation when the pedicle is long ; it presents a bright red and fleshy character, and bleeds at the slightest touch. The tumour generally recedes spontaneously after defsecation ; sometimes, however, the pedicle is so long that the growth remains outside and becomes deeply congested. When the polypus is situated high up in the bowel the only symptom may be bleeding, but a true intussusception of the bowel may occur, the polypus forming its apex. When the polypus is low down, the surgeon will feel it with the finger in the rectum, and can make out the presence of a pedicle attached to the wall of the bowel above the pile-bearing area ; there should, therefore, be no difficulty in diagnosing it from haemorrhoids. When, however, the polypus is situated high up, sigmoidoscopic examination will be necessary before the diagnosis can be made. TREATMENT.â€”^The patient should be anaesthetised, the anus dilated, and the tumour seized and pulled down with pile forceps ; it should also be noted whether one or more tumours are present. The pedicle must then be ligatured, and it is important to avoid any possibility of

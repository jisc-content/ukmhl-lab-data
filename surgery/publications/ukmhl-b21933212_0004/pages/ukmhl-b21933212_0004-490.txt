Abdominal lymphangioplasty.â€”The abdomen is opened below the umbilicus, and a series of silk threads are darned in and out through the parietal peritoneum over the iliac fossae, the loops which project into the abdominal cavity being left fairly long. The threads are then carried underneath the outer part of Poupart's ligament and distributed in the subcutaneous tissue of the upper part of the thigh and buttock. Another method consists in attempting to establish drainage through the femoral canal. The saphenous opening is exposed as for the radical cure of a femoral hernia and the canal dilated. The peritoneum is then sought for, and brought down and sutured to the edge of the opening beneath Poupart's ligament, or a hollow glass button is inserted in the ring. The wound is then sewn up and the ascitic fluid escapes into the cellular tissue in Scarpa's triangle and is absorbed by the lymphatic vessels.

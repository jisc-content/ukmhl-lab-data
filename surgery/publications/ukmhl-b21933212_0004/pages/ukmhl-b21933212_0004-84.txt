AFFECTIONS OF THE JAWS 52 can be removed by dividing the palatal process to one side of the middle line, the frontal process of the bone below the orbital margin, and the malar process externally. The pos- terior part of the ant- rum, which generally breaks off, can be chipped away, and, if necessary, the pterygoid process can be removed; in this way free access is obtained to the naso- pharynx. The base of the tumour can then be dealt with properly. The deformity resulting from an operation of this kind is slight, as the incision need not be carried far out along the orbital margin, and hardly shows when care- fully united, while the cavity left is shut off Fig. 24. â€” Nelaton's Operation for Naso-pharyngeal from the mOUth bv the Polypi. Exposure of the growth. The divided palate is pulled . aside by sutures. hard palate ; the sink- ing-in of the cheek is not marked, since no portion of the malar bone need be taken away. When the tumour is malignant and sessile, no operation short of a partial excision of the upper jaw, such as the above, will give satisfactory access to the part ; with such an operation, there is a perfect view into the naso-pharynx if the pterygoid process is also cut through. Such a procedure will be found described in the Lettsomian Lectures for 1897.1 In the case detailed in these lectures the access to the disease, after removal of the lower part of the upper jaw and the pterygoid processes, was perfect, and, although a portion of the Eustachian tube was involved, it was taken away thoroughly and with practically no bleeding. A preliminary laryngotomy should be performed. ' See also Objects and Limits of Operations for Cancer, by W. Watson Cheyne. Bailliere, Tyndall & Cox. 1897.

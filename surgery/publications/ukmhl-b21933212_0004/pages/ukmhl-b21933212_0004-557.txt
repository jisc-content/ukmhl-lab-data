These important congenital deformities go by the generic term of ' imperforate anus,' but they are better divided into the two separate classes—imperforate anus and imperforate rectum. Fig. 177.—Diagrammatic representation of the different varieties of Im- rERFORATE Anus. A and B represent two common varieties ; in the former the anal depression is developed, in the latter it is absent. In both the sphincter is developed and the rectum extends down to the perineum. In C the rectum ends high up in the pelvis. In D, E, and F there is a fistulous communication with the bladder, urethra, and vagina respectively.

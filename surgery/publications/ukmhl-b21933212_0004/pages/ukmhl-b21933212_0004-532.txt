AFFFXTIONS OF THE INTESTINES 500 support (see Fig. i68). The line of union should be transverse to the long axis of the body. After the dressing has been applied, the abdomen is supported by a binder. It is well to keep the patient in bed for about four weeks so as to aUow the union to become firm ; during that period a stout binder is used, and for some months afterwards the patient should wear a suitable abdominal belt without any pad over the hernial orifice. Treatment in adults.—Umbilical hernia is most common in women during and after the child-bearing period, and may be reducible or irreducible. In the latter case there is often much Fig. ib8.—Radical Cure of Umbilical Hernia in a Young Subject. The upper sketch shows the method of splitting the abdominal wall horizontally, while the lower one shows the two layers thus formed sutured separately; a stout mattress suture runs through the angles of the flaps on each side. The peritoneum and skin are sutured separately. It is the fibrous wall that is split; the recti are untouched. discomfort from adhesions of the omentum, which anchor the transverse colon and in some cases pull upon the stomach ; for this reason alone it may be necessary to perform a radical operation. The result of the operation is not nearly so satisfactory as in inguinal hernia, and the union may become stretched, especially if the patient becomes pregnant. Hence radical cure should not be urged in young women unless the hernia is irreducible and causes much discomfort ; as long as the hernia is small and reducible, a truss should be employed, consisting of a flat pad embedded in a firm elastic abdominal belt of large size and fitted with perineal straps. It is unlikely that actual cure will occur in adults; but as long as the hernia does not increase in size and complications do not arise, this apparatus will suffice. Should, however, the hernia increase in size and cause much discomfort, or should it become irreducible or obstructed,

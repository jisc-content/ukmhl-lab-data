CHAPTER IX. 73 MALIGNANT DISEASE OF THE TONGUE. SARCOMA. Sarcoma has been met with in the tongue both as a primary and a secondary growth, but it is exceedingly rare ; its treatment is similar to that of sarcoma elsewhere. EPITHELIOMA. This is the most important disease of the tongue, and the results after removal are particularly unfavourable. It is much more common in males than in females. The most usual seat of the growth is the middle and anterior part of the edge of the tongue, but it is not uncommon towards the base, and is often an extension from the tonsil, the fauces, or the pharynx. Of the causation of lingual cancer, nothing more is known than tliat of cancer in general. Here, as elsewhere, it is ascribed to some form of irritation, and there is no question that a rough tooth is a common exciting cause in a patient predisposed to cancer. It is also often attributed to smoking, but while the constant irritation of tobacco in a susceptible subject may play some part, we are inclined to think that its role has been exaggerated. Epithelioma of the tongue varies in its characters in different cases. In the majority, it is a rapidly growing and very malignant tumour. It may occur as a crack or fissure with hard edges, or as a prominent sore on the tongue without any deep ulceration or marked outgrowth. In other cases it may begin as a warty mass with a hard base and edges, which increases and forms a cauliflowerlike excrescence yielding a foul discharge and characterised by deep ulcerations and fissures in the clefts between the papillomatous prominences.

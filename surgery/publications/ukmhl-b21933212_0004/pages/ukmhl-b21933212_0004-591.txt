559 CHAPTER XXXIX. FISSURE IN ANO : ECZEMA AND PRURITUS ANI. FISSURE IN ANO. By this term is understood a small ulcer or fissure lying just within the external sphincter and extending upwards from the muco-cutaneous margin. It is more common in women than in men and causes much pain, although the lesion itself is trifling. The fissure is generally situated about the posterior commissure of the anus, and by separating the buttocks it is generally possible to see its lower end, which is usually quite shallow, although it may occasionally extend down to the fibres of the external sphincter. At the lower end of the fissure there is often a small projecting tag of mucous membrane called a ' sentinel pile.' A fissure may arise in various ways. Probably the most common is mechanical detachment of a small piece of the mucous membrane in the act of passing hard faeces ; this is torn downwards and causes intense pain. Haemorrhoids are generally also present. A fissure may also result from undue distension of the anus or from injury—for example, with the nozzle of an enema syringe—and it is not uncommon as a result of a superficial syphilitic ulceration. The symptoms are very characteristic. There is intense cutting or burning pain during defcecation, which lasts for some time after the act. When the pain passes off, the patient is free until the next time the bowels are moved, and in consequence the action is deferred as long as possible, and then the scybalous masses give rise to increased agony. Sometimes the motions are slightly streaked with blood, but there is never the free haemorrhage characteristic of piles. On examining the patient, the most obvious condition is spasm of the sphincter, which is increased at the slightest touch, so .that it is practically impossible to pass the finger through the anus, and no attempt should be made to do so without a general anaesthetic. On separating the buttocks the sentinel pile can

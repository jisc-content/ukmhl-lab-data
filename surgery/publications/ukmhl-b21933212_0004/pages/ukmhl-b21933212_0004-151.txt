119 DIVISION II. THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE PHARYNX AND CESOPHAGUS. CHAPTER XI. AFFECTIONS OF THE PHARYNX AND TONSILS. MALFORMATIONS OF THE PHARYNX. PHARYNGEAL FISTULA. This is a very rare condition, resulting from incomplete closiu'e of one of the branchial clefts. It is considered in connection with affections of the neck (see Vol. V.). PHARYNGOCELE. This term is apphed to a condition of pouching of the pharynx, which usually occurs at its lower part and on its posterior aspect just at its junction with the oesophagus ; as the pouch increases in size, it generally passes towards the left side. Food collects in the interior of the pouch and leads to a swelling in the neck which may be emptied on pressure. From time to time the retained food may be vomited in a more or less decomposed condition, and when the pouch is large and full it may actually interfere with swallowing owing to the pressure it exerts on the outside of the pharynx or oesophagus. When the orifice of communication between the pouch and the pharynx is very small, food may not pass into the diverticulum, which may then become distended with air and form a resonant swelling in the neck easily emptied by pressure. The condition is not uncommon and usually occurs in adult males. The congenital origin of these pouches is doubtful, though in some instances muscular fibres have been shown to be present in their wall. In most cases the sac

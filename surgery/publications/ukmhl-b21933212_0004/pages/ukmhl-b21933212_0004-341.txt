309 CANCER nent opening in the duodenum or the jejunum. This may be called for when the cancer is too far advanced for excision and also when it spreads so extensively over the surface of the stomach that there is no possibility of performing a gastro-jejunostomy successfully. A permanent opening on the further side of the growth is therefore the only means of prolonging the patient's life, but in these cases he is so near death when the operation is performed that the chances of any material prolongation of life are extremely slight. The operation is done through the ordinary vertical incision, slightly to the right of the middle line, and the duodenum, if possible—or, failing that, the jejunum—is brought up into the wound, fixed in position by sutures and an opening made and a tube fastened in, as in gastros- tomy (see p. 183). Witzel's or Kader's methods are the best in these cases, as the opening in the bowel must be very small so as not to interfere with the passage of bile and pancreatic secretion past the artificial orifice ; it is particularly important not to form a spur, as is done in inguinal colostomy, otherwise the bile and pancreatic secretion will be discharged through the wound, to the patient's great discomlorr and disadvantage. 3. Of cancer of the cardiac end of the stomach.—This ccm- dition is practically identical with malignant disease of the cardiac end of the oesophagus—at any rate, as far as its treatment is concerned (see p. 180). Gastrostomy or jejunostomy are the only surgical procedures.

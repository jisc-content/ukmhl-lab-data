513 ENTEROPTOSIS the corset to ride up indicates that it has not been laced tightly enough below the waist, or that it has been laced too tightly above, or that it is too large. The lower end of the corset can be kept closely applied above the pubes by attaching the suspenders to each end in front and fastening them to the stockings at the inner and back part of the thigh. A very efhcient corset is made as follows: A number of strips of webbing long enough to go round the patient's waist are laid side by side so as to overlap by about one-third of their width. These are now sewn to another piece of fabric so as to make a sort of many-tailed bandage. The patient is laid on her back with her pelvis supported by a firm wedge-shaped pillow, and the strips of webbing placed in posi- tion beneath her. Each strip is then brought round and fastened in front. The position of each strip is then marked and the whole ultimately finished off by the corsetiere. A pad may also be placed over the pelvic region beneath the corsets, and the close application of the lower part of the corsets may be still further insured by attaching broad strong bands to the corset on each side below the level of the anterior superior spine and buckling them in front (see Fig. 173). Sometimes it is of advantage to incorporate a metal plate with the corset or belt. This plate, which consists of thin steel or aluminium, is made to a plaster- cast of the hypogastric region. Such a cast is readily made by greasing the abdomen and spreading over it a sheet of lint saturated with plaster of Paris while the patient is in the recumbent position. This is allowed to set, and then removed. The positive cast is made by filling up the mould Fig. I7J.â€”Combined Abdominal 13elt and Cor- set. The belt portion is constructed of straps of strong webbing sewn togetlier and is fastened or ad- justed by separate laces. It is kept in position by the thigh-piece and suspenders. {Mmes.

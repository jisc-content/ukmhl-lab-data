98 AFFECTIONS OF THE TONGUE of bone must be removed. No risk of recurrence should be run by being too sparing in the removal of the bone. The remarks made on p. 45, with reference to the pitiable plight of patients who have had portions of the lower jaw excised, apply to the cases now under con- sideration, and the surgeon must always place the full facts of the case before the patient as dispassionately as possible before operation is decided upon. Partial excision of the jaw.â€”When the disease is situated towards the front of the tongue, spreads over the floor of the mouth and infiltrates the muco - periosteum and the ramus of the jaw, the best plan, after perform- ing a preliminary tracheo- tomy, is to make a curved incision with its convexity downwards, commencing close to the symphysis, running down nearly to the hyoid bone and curving upwards to the neighbourhood of the angle of the jaw (see Fig. 36). This flap is then turned up with ah the soft tissues on the outer surface of the jaw, the bone is cleared, the mucous membrane over the jaw is divided in front and behind, well clear of the disease, the necessary teeth are ex- tracted and the jaw is sawn through in front and behind well beyond the limits of the disease. The divided portion of the jaw is now left attached to the tongue, while the glands in the submaxillary region, which are generally infected, are dissected out and the hngual artery tied as it passes beneath the hyoglossus muscle. The mouth is then opened with a gag and the next stage of the operation carried out from the mouth. The mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth is divided in front of the disease, the anterior pillar of the fauces is snipped through and the tongue spHt along the raphe. The flap is then turned up, the mylo-hyoid muscle divided, and a view of the interior is obtained by pushing the detached portion of bone out of the

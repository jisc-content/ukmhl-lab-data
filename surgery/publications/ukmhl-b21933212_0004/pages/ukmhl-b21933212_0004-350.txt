A very long thread is taken and the omentum transfixed all around the haematoma as depicted above. A series of loops is made and these are divided along the marks shown in the diagram so as to produce a number of separate ligatures which are tied one by one. As the needle is made to transfix the omentum each time the thread is caught by a hook or by forceps, the needle withdrawn still threaded and made to transfix the omentum again further on. where the same procedure is repeated.

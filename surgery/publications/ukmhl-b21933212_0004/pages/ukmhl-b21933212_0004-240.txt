208 CHAPTER XIV. GENERAL REMARKS ON LAPAROTOMY : INTESTINAL SUTURE. TREATMENT OF THE PATIENT BEFORE AND AFTER EXPLORATORY LAPAROTOMY. The preparation of the patient in cases of abdominal operations lias reference only to operations for chronic disease ; in acute cases, no time can be wasted in preliminary measures. Practice varies very much as regards the amount of time and care devoted to the preparation of the patient before an abdominal operation ; some surgeons keep him in bed for several days in order to accustom him to the restraint and to teach him to lie in the dorsal position.

In all cases it is well to attend to the teeth, and if there is pyorrhoea alveolaris this should be treated by a dentist. It is well also to put the patient on a restricted and practically fluid diet for twenty-four hours previous to operation. Some advise that only boUed food should be given, and maintain that by cleaning the teeth and administering boiled food, the upper part of the alimentary canal can be rendered aseptic, especially if this treatment is continued for several days.

The bowels must be thoroughly evacuated before the operation, and it is well to administer a purgative, preferably castor oil, two nights before the operation. Given at that time, the irritating effect of the purgative on the bowels wiU have completely

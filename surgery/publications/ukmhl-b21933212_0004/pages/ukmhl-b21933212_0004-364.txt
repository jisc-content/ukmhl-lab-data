AFFECTIONS OF THE INTESTINES 332 of the bowel by a band, internal hernia, external hernia, volvulus, or acute intussusception. Somewhat similar symptoms may also arise from blockage of the canal by a foreign body, e.g., a gall-stone, or from acute kinking of the bowel. Sirang'itlation of a portion of the intestine tmder a band is not at all uncommon, and if there is a history pointing to a previous attack of Fig. 120.—^The Anatomy of the parts concerned in Hernia into the Fossa DuoDENO-jEjuNALis (Treitz's Hernia). I, Transverse colon. 2, Transverse meso- colon. 3, Descending colon. 4, Upper boundary of duodenal fossa. 5, Lower border of pancreas. 6, 7, 8, Vascular arch of Treitz, consisting of the arteria colica sinistra and the inferior mesenteric vein, constituting the anterior boundary of the para- duodenal fossa. 9, Para-duodenal fossa. 10, Inferior boundary of the para-duodenal fossa.

The most acute forms are usually due to this condition. These bands may be the result of peritonitis uniting one portion of the intestine to another or to the abdominal wall, or causing adhesions of the omentum ; as the result of long-continued vermicular movements of the bowels they become stretched and form loops beneath which the intestine may be strangulated. In other cases the band may be due to the attachment of such structures as the appendix or Meckel's

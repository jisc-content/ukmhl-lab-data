AFFECTIONS OF THE STOMACH 274 suture uniting all the coats of the stomach and jejunum completely around the orifice, and terminating with the completion of the original sero-muscular suture. Finally, the open end of the proximal loop is uncovered and is implanted into the convex border of the distal loop below the point where it crosses the colon (see Fig. 102), another clamp being placed upon the distal loop below the jejuno-jejunostomy orifice to prevent the intestinal contents escaping through the lateral incision in the intestine. The lateral implantation is done in the same way as the Fig. 102.â€”Roux's Y-operation of Gastro-jejunostomy. The operation is shown completed, but with the clamps still in position. gastro-jejunostomy. The clamps are then removed and catgut stitches put into the rent in the mesentery. Another way of performing the operation is first to perform an anterior gastro-jejunostomy in the ordinary manner (see p. 271) and then to divide the jejunum on the proximal side of the anastomosis and to implant the open proximal end laterally into the small intestine well below the gastro-jejunostomy opening, invaginating and closing the other end. On the whole the first method is probably the better as there is some risk of disturbing the gastro-jejunostomy sutures when dividing and invaginating the open end of the bowel, through which, moreover, it is difficult to prevent the escape of gastric contents.

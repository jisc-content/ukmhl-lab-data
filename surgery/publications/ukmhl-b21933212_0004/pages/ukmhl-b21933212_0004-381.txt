349 CHAPTER XXIII. INTUSSUSCEPTION : OBSTRUCTION AFTER LAPAROTOMY ACUTE INTUSSUSCEPTION. Intussusception is a very common form of intestinal obstruction, and forms more than a third of the cases. It is by far the most common form of obstrnction in children, and is almost the only one met with in infants. In it a portion of the bowel becomes invaginated into the gut below, so that the intestinal canal is doubled upon itself. It seems to be not so much a projection of a contracted portion of intestine into that below as what may be called a swallowing of the contracted upper part of the bowel by the part below. The usual opinion is that this occurs most frequently at the ileo-csecal valve, and in nearly one half the cases the intussusception is formed by the lower end of the ileum passing into the caecum, the apex of tlie invaginated portion being the ileo-caecal valve. This form is called the ileo-ccBcal intussusception, but in some cases classed in this group, the apex of the intussusception is not the ileo-csecal valve itself, but an inch or two of the caecum, and in reducing these cases the last thing to be undone is a dimple in the caecum itself. The next most common form is the enteric, in which one part of the small intestine, generally the jejunum, passes into the part below. Much more rare are the colic intussusceptions, in which one portion of the large intestine is received into another. This is most common about the sigmoid flexure and the upper end of the rectum, and usually occurs in connection with growths of the intestine. The rarest form of all is the ileo-colic, in which the ileum passes through the ileo-ciecal valve and projects into the colon. Intussusception is due to various causes. In infants the affection may be preceded by some intestinal disturbance, such as diarrhoea, and owing to irregular contraction of the bowel, a portion of the contracted intestine passes into the lumen of the bowel immediately below.

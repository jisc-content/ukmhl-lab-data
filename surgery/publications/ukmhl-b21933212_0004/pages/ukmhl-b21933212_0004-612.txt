58o AFFECTIONS OF THE RECTUM AND ANUS least, lying upon one side with the buttocks slightly raised upon a pillow so as to prevent the mass coming down again. The bowels should be confined for a day or two. Should this manipulation fail to reduce the piles permanently, the best plan is to apply repeated hot fomentations, which in this particular region can be done by wringing a soft sponge out of water as hot as it can be borne, applying it to the anus, covering it over with a large mass of cotton-wool and a T-bandage, and renewing it frequently. This method is particularly good for cases in which there is a large inflamed irreducible mass of mixed internal and external piles, and in which any attempt at reduction gives rise to great pain and causes increased inflammation from the spasmodic contraction of the sphincter. Unless this treatment rapidly relieves the swelling, operation should be urged —even in the face of considerable contra-indications—as the risk is much less than that of allowing the piles to become gangrenous, as they probably will. The treatment of gangrenous piles is identical with that of the inflamed irreducible variety just mentioned, and consists in their immediate removal, or in the application of hot fomentations if operation is refused or thought inadvisable ; morphine will be required to allay the pain. The treatment of isolated thrombosed piles is dealt with on p. 568.

GASTRIC ULCER 291 and is not accompanied by extensive induration or distortion of the surrounding stomach wall. An incision is made in the anterior wall of the stomach parallel to the curvatures, extending at least an inch beyond each end of the constriction. The incision is carried into the interior of the stomach just beyond one end of the stricture, and the constriction is divided by pushing either a probe-pointed bistoury or one blade of a pair Fig. 108.â€”Methods of treaiing an ' Hour-glass Contraction ' of the Stomach. A and A' show the two stages of gastroplasty, B, B' and C, C the stages of gastro- gastrostomy under different conditions, while D, D' shows partial gastrectomy com- bined with subsequent gastro-gastrostomy, the shaded portion being the part excised. of probe-pointed scissors along the narrow portion so as to divide the stricture throughout. This longitudinal incision is now conx'erted into a transverse one by approximating the ends of the incision with sutures of silk (see p. 278) ; if there is little tension, but fairly free oozing, a continuous stitch taking up all the coats of the stomach may then be inserted, but should the tension be considerable, mattress sutures should be used. Outside the first line of sutures a continuous sero-niuscular suture of fine catgut completes the closure (see Fig. 108, A). u 2

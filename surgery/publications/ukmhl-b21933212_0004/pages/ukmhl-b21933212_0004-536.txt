504 AFFECTIONS OF THE INTESTINES LUMBAR HERNIA. This occurs in the triangle of Petit, which is formed by the iliac crest below, the latissimus dorsi on the inner and the external oblique on the outer side. The abdominal wall is weak at this spot and violent strains may cause a hernial protrusion. Treatment.—The best treatment is to provide support either by a truss with a large pad and a perineal strap to prevent it from slipping up, or by firmly fitting corsets with a suitable pad ; the latter are often the more satisfactory. If the apparatus does not control the hernia or if it causes pain—as it often does from pressure on the crest of the ilium —it may be advisable to perform an operation much on the same lines as for ventral hernia {vide supya). EXCESSIVE SEPARATION OF THE RECTI. It is not uncommon in women, as the result of repeated pregnancies, for the recti to become widely separated and to allow a marked bulging of the whole centre of the abdominal wall. As a rule a well-fitting belt suffices; but if a radical operation seems to be advisable, closure may be Fig. 170.—Method of operating for undue separation of the Recti. The inner edge of the rectus on each side is denuded of its sheath and the redundant peritoneum is cut away after a series of sutures have been inserted in the manner shown above. Then through-and-tlirough sutures are inserted in the abdominal wall. effected by making an incision a little to one side of the middle line, removing the fibrous tissue between the recti, bringing them together by stitches, and inserting mattress sutures through the entire thickness of the abdominal wall, as shown in the diagram (see Fig. 170). The through-and-through sutures are tied after the skin has been stitched up.

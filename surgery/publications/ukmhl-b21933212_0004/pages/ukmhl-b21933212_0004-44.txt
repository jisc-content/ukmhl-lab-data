CHAPTER II. 12 AFFECTIONS OF THE TEMPORO-MANDIBULAR ARTICULATION. DISLOCATION. From the point of view of treatment these affections may be divided up into recent dislocations, unreduced dislocations, and subluxation of the inter-articular fibro-cartilages. RECENT DISLOCATIONS. Dislocation of the lower jaw may be unilateral or, more commonly, bilateral. It is more frequent in women than in men, and usually results from yawning, laughing, or some other action in which the mouth is widely opened. It may also occur from indirect violence, such as a blow on the chin, especially if this be applied in the downward direction so as to force the mouth open. In the normal movement of opening the mouth the condyles of the lower jaw, accompanied by their inter- articular fibro-cartilages, gUde forwards over the eminenti^ articulares, on the summits of which the condyles lie when the jaw is fully open. If the depression of the lower jaw is carried beyond this, the inter-articular fibro-cartilages remain stationary owing to their connection with the bone, while the condyles slip forward in front of the eminentiae articulares, and becomes fixed there by the contraction of the temporal and masseter muscles. The result is that the mouth cannot be closed, any attempt to shut it being met by contraction of these muscles ; the saUva dribbles away and there is severe pain. Mastication is impossible, and speech is almost unintelligible. TREATMENT.â€”In order to reduce a bilateral dislocaiion, each condyle must be puUed downwards from the temporal fossa until it reaches the level of the eminentia articularis ; it is then pushed back into position. Reduction is usually effected without an anaesthetic. The patient sits upright in a chair, with the head supported by an assistant or against

EPITHELIOMA 105 The first guide is the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid, which must be exposed throughout the whole length of the wound. The second is the jugular vein, which should always be exposed below the glandular mass. The third is the spinal accessory nerve. After the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid muscle has been defined, which is done in turning aside the flaps, the internal jugular vein should be exposed about the level of the cricoid cartilage, and the deep fascia divided along the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid muscle, taking care not to injure any enlarged glands which may be present. To Fig. 38.—Exposure of the Lateral Glandular Area of the Neck. The flaps of skin and superficial tissues marked out in the previous figure have been dissected up, exposing the deep cervical fascia.—[Butlin, ' Diseases of the Tongue.') expose the vein a vertical incision is made through the deep fascia just in front of the anterior margin of the sterno-mastoid muscle at the lower end of the wound, and the internal jugular vein can be exposed almost immediately with the handle of the knife or a dissector. If the glands are not markedly enlarged the sheath of the vessels should be taken away with the fat and glands, but the vein itself may be left behind. If, however, there is marked glandular enlargement it is, in our opinion, advisable to remove the vein in almost all cases, because its sheath is always more or less adherent, and, moreover, the vein itself is frequently inextricably involved in the glandular mass, and eft'orts

Fig. 202.â€”Tkeatment of the Peritoneum in Perineal Excision of the Rectum. In A the peritoneal cul-de-sac has been opened, while in B the lateral reflections are freely divided, allowing the bowel to be drawn well down. Before the rectum is cut across above the growth the cut edge of the peritoneum (held in forceps in the figure) is sutured to the sero-muscular coats of the bowel as it is held in the position depicted above. {Hartmann and Qulnu.)

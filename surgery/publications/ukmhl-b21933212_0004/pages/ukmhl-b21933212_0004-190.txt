158 CHAPTER XII. THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE (ESOPHAGUS. In a person of average height the oesophagus is about nine inches in length and extends almost vertically from the lower border of the cricoid to the level of the ensiform cartilage ; the landmarks behind are from the fifth cervical to the ninth dorsal vertebra. In front of the upper part of the oesophagus is the trachea; lower down are the left bronchus, the arch of the aorta, the pericardium, and the left vagus. Behind, it rests mainly upon the vertebral column and the thoracic duct, but about three inches above the diaphragm it crosses the aorta. The pleura lies on each side of the oesophagus, and the right pleura sends a prolongation behind it above, so that it is not easy to reach it on the right side in that situation without damaging the pleura. Above the arch of the aorta the oesophagus is best reached from the left side ; below the arch, from the right side. The total distance from the upper incisor teeth to the stomach averages i6 inches. The distance from the upper incisor teeth to the commencement of the oesophagus, i.e. the lower border of the cricoid cartilage, is about 6J inches, to the bifurcation of the trachea about II inches, and to the point at which the aorta crosses the oesophagus about 12 inches. These measurements are very variable. MALFORMATIONS. A number of congenital malformations may be met with for which practically nothing can be done, and which need no description here ; for example, communications between the trachea and the oesophagus, congenital constrictions of the oesophagus, and imperforate gullet. (ESOPHAGEAL DIVERTICULA. This condition is similar to that met with in the pharynx (see p. 119), and most of the pouches of supposed oesophageal origin are situated at the upper part of the tube and probably originate from the pharynx What has been said with regard to the symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of pharyngeal pouches applies also to these diverticula.

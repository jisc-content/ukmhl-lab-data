155 MALIGNANT TUMOURS away from the larynx, this is not of importance. The best plan is to mark out the area to be removed with a fine thermo-cautery point. If this is done the surgeon can make quite sure of removing the disease completely when the tissues become subsequently unrecognisable from the burning. Any glands in the neck can he dealt with immediately before the disease in the mouth is removed, the wound being stitched up and covered with gauze while the mouth operation is in progress. After-treatment.—Antiseptic gargles, such as sanitas or Condy's fluid, should be used for ten days or a fortnight. The food should be fluid at Fig. 54.—Division of the Lower Jaw in removal of a Cancer of the Pharvn.\. The shaded part ot the mandible denotes the portion that is removed. first and may be introduced by a tube passed backwards along the sound side of the mouth : the food may also be given through a nasal tube if the above plan does not succeed. The patient soon regains the power of swallowing. Removal through the neck.—In the majority of cases the disease must be reached from outside. In the first place the glands must be removed from the anterior triangle in all cases, and this is best done by an incision along the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid from the lobule of the ear down to the lower part of the neck. From this vertical incision another should be carried along the hyoid bone and curved upwards nearly to the lower border of the jaw over the anterior end of the submaxillary triangle (see Fig. 54). These flaps are dissected up, and the anterior and submaxillary triangles are cleared out (see p. loi) ; in most cases the jugular vein should also be removed. The digastric muscle should be thoroughly exposed as the tumour is in close contact

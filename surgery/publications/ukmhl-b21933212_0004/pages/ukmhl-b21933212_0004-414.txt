Fig. 137.—Pins for expediting the operation of Colostomy. Each pin—which is of tempered steel with a sharp point—is thrust through the skin and muscles on one side of the wound, then through the meso-colon, and finally made to traverse the constitnents of the abdominal wall in the reverse order on the opposite side. The pins are bolted together, and the bowel can then neither advance nor recede. If two safety pins be passed through the lips of the wound and the muscular coat of the bowel as shown above, no stitches at all are necessary, and the operation can be done very rapidly. The manner in which the pins are bolted together is also shown. Fig. 138.—^The Haemostatic Suture in Colostomy.

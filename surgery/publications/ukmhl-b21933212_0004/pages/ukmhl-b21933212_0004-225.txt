IV. 193 o DIVISION III, THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE STOMACH AND INTESTINES. CHAPTER XIII. AFFECTIONS OF THE ABDOMINAL WALL. TRAUMATIC AFFECTIONS. Injuries of the abdominal wall may or may not be accompanied by a breach of the skin, and they differ in no way from similar injuries else- where, but they acquire importance from the fact that they are often asso- ciated with injury to the abdominal contents. Thus, an incised wound may penetrate the abdominal wall and damage the structures in the interior, and even a severe contusion may be associated with the most extensive internal injuries. The first effect of a blow on the abdominal wall is that the muscles contract and pi'otect the abdominal contents up to a certain point. When, however, the blow is severe, the wall yields to the pressure, —especially when it is sudden and the muscles are taken by surprise—- and deeper-seated injuries occur. Examples of such injuries are rupture of the stomach, intestines, bladder, liver, spleen, or kidneys. The injuries of the abdominal wall may therefore be divided into two great classes : (i) Injuries limited to the abdominal wall, which in their turn may be [a) simple contusions, {b) rupture of muscles, or (c) non-penetrating wounds ; and (2) injuries of the wall accompanied by a lesion of the abdominal contents with or without solution of continuity of the skin.

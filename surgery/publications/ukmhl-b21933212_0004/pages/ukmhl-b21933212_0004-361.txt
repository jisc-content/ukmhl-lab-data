329 INJURIES purgatives after that period. When the injury has only affected the small intestine, the patient should have an enema daily, and if anything further is required, some saline mineral water may be administered ; no violent purgatives should be employed at first. When there is much pain, fifteen grains of aspirin and twenty grains of bromide of potassium may be given fey rectum, or heroin (gr. yV to ^) may be administered hypodermically. It is well to avoid the use of morphine, so as not to paralyse the intestine. In injury to the large intestine enemata should not be employed. TREATMENT OF INJURIES TO THE INTESTINE WHEN PERITONITIS IS ESTABLISHED. It not infrequently happens—especiallj' in gunshot wounds on the battle-field—that the patient is not seen until some long time has elapsed, and then the nature of the case is essentially different and it becomes practically a septic peritonitis of the very worst type. When once general peritonitis has become established there is no object whatever in operating in the great majority of cases, as there is practically no likeli- hood of cleansing the abdominal cavity and thus arresting the septic peritonitis, whilst the mere operation, involving as it does a great amount of shock from the handling of inflamed intestines, will probably prove fatal. As a matter of fact the best chance for the patient is to place him at absolute rest in the hope that the peritonitis may become localised and that an abscess, or—in the case of a perforating abdominal wound— a fscal fistula, may form. At most a small opening may be made and one or more drainage tubes inserted.

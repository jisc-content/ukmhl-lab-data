Fig. 10.â€”Elsbeeg's Apparatus for the Intratracheal Administration of Ether. Ihe apparatus may be driven electrically or by means of a foot-bellows attached to the tube, K. The air passes along the course marked > from the fan to the oil-filter, A. It is then warmed and passed over the surface of the ether and thence to the tracheal tube, J. The course of the mixed air and ether is marked ^-v . B is a control-tap regulating the pressure, which is indicated by the manometer, B. C is a deflation-tap ; when it is open no mixture passes into the tracheal tube. F and G are the electric switch and rheostat. H is a tube through which oxygen can be added to the mixture.

478 CHAPTER XXX. HERNIA : THE TREATMENT OF THE INDIVIDUAL FORMS. INGUINAL HERNIA. There are two forms of inguinal hernia whioh must be considered separately—namely, the congenital form in which the sac has existed, from birth, and the acquired form in which the sac is probably newly formed. In congenital hernia—of which there are several varieties—the sac is the unobliterated portion of the funicular process of the peritoneum, and various conditions may be present (see Fig. 158). The process may be patent from end to end—the cavity of the peritoneum above being con- tinuous with that of the tunica vaginalis below ; it may be obliterated with the exception of a small funnel-shaped portion at the upper part; or the upper part alone may be obliterated, so that a hernia, pushing a fresh sac before it, invaginates the unobliterated portion of the funicular process below—the so-called ' infantile hernia.' Inguinal hernia may also be divided into the oblique and the direct forms. The ordinary oblique inguinal hernia descends along the cord from the internal abdominal ring, and may be congenital or acquired ; the direct form passes out on the inner side of the deep epigastric artery, either stretching or perforating the conjoined tendon, and is always acquired. REDUCIBLE OBLIQUE INGUINAL HERNIA. Cure may occasionally, but rarely, follow the continued application of an efficient truss in the congenital hernise of infancy and early child- hood ; if the hernia is kept reduced from the first, the funicular process may become obliterated, partly in the course of the natural development

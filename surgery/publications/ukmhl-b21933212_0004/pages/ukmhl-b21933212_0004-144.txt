112 CHAPTER X. AFFECTIONS OF THE FLOOR OF THE MOUTH RANULA. A RANULA is a cyst in the floor of the mouth or on the under-surface of the tongue due to dilatation of one of the muciparous glands from blocking of its duct. The blocking of the duct may be due to inflammation about the orifice, or to obstruction by inspissated mucus. The cyst forms a rounded prominent sweUing on one side of the middle line which varies in size from a pea to a plover's egg, and has a characteristic bluish tint, which has been aptly compared to a purple grape. It contains a considerable quantity of mucin and may occasionally be large enough to interfere with the movements of the tongue. TREATMENT.â€”W^Aew the tumour is small, the surface may be painted with a lo per cent, solution of cocaine, to which are added a few drops of adrenalin chloride, and a little of this solution may also be injected beneath the mucous membrane over the cyst ; the mucous membrane over the anterior wall of the cyst is then caught up with toothed forceps, divided, and the cyst removed entire. When the cyst is large, its complete removal leaves a cavity in the floor of the mouth in which saliva and food collect and undergo putrefaction. The best plan in these cases is to apply cocaine as above, puU up the tongue with tongue-forceps, seize the anterior wall of the cyst in catch- forceps and clip away as much of it as possible, so as to expose the deeper part of the cyst freely. This portion is then sponged over with undiluted carbolic acid or with pure nitric acid on a glass brush ; in the latter case the acid is subsequently neutralised by filling the mouth with a solution of carbonate of soda. A strip of iodoform gauze is packed into the cavity and renewed daily until the whole wall is granulating, when further packing is unnecessary. This method generally effects a cure, and it is only when recurrence takes place after it that it is necessary to subject

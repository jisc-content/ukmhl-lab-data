AFFECTIONS OF THE (ESOPHAGUS The stomach is carried through the canal thus formed, brought out through the skin at the second incision, and the protruded portion grasped by an assistant (see Fig. 75). The stomach is prevented from shpping back into the abdominal cavity by suturing the right-hand edge of the incision in the peritoneum and sheath of the rectus to the adjacent surface of the viscus. It is unnecessary to sew the stomach to the left-hand side of the abdominal incision, as the organ is firmly flexed over this edge. Finally, Fig. 75.—Franck's Gastrostomy. First stage. The anterior wall of the stomach is pulled out through the opening in the posterior layer of the sheath of the rectus just to the left of the middle line. It is held over to the left side and its sero-muscular coat united to the right-hand edge of the incision in the sheath of the rectus by a continuous running suture. The sketch also shows the second smaller incision just below the costal margin. a few stitches are inserted between the second skin incision and the portion of the stomach wall emerging from it, and if the stomach is not opened at this time it is well to insert two silk stitches into the latter; these are knotted and left long so as to serve as guides when the stomach has to be opened subsequently. The operation is completed by suturing the first skin incision completely. Neither the opening into the abdomen nor the second opening through the skin should constrict the portion of stomach passing through it.

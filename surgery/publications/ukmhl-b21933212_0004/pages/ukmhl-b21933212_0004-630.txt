598 AFFECTIONS OF THE RECTUM AND ANUS being taken to keep well away from the wall of the bowel. All the fat and glands should be removed from the hollow of the sacrum, and there should be no hesitation in removing the coccyx if it is necessary to get more room. The separation of the bowel is easily accomplished behind and on either side as far as the levator ani ; the connection in front with the vagina or the prostate and urethra is, however,very intimate, and great care must be taken. A finger in the vagina or a large sound in the male bladder will help considerably. The next step is to divide the levatores ani all round (see Fig. 200), any vessels being picked up as they are divided.

The cul-de-sac of the peritoneum is now opened, a tampon of gauze thrust in, and the isolation of the bowel proceeded with. The bowel is then dra\\'n through the anus and, when it has been freed sufficiently, the parietal peritoneum is stitched to the sero-muscular coat well above the point of section. The situation of the new anal opening is now decided upon. Formerly, the bowel was brought down to the normal position, and if any portion

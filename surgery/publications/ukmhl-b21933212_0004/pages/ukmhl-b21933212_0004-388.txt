AFFECTIONS OF THE INTESTINES 356 in the intussuscipiens is closed in the usual manner (see Fig. 132) and the clamps removed. Another method which has been successfully adopted in some cases is simply to relieve the obstruction by a lateral anastomosis of the bowel above and below the obstruction. The obvious disadvantage of this method is that the intussusception is not dealt with and may become gangrenous and lead to fatal peritonitis. The advantages are rapidity of operation and the restoration of the intestinal canal, thus avoiding the necessity for any further operation. When the tumour is gangrenous, the condition is very serious indeed. Here Barker's operation is inadmissible, and the best method is to excise the portion of intestine containing the gangrenous intussusceptum, and either bring out the ends and insert Paul's tubes in each (see p. 343) or perform a lateral anastomosis, after invaginating the divided ends of the bowel. Unfortunately, the infant rarely recovers from either of these procedures. There is another method which we have carried out successfully in one case, in which the patient was not in a condition to stand resection of the bowel; it is to bring out the loop of bowel above the obstruction and make an artificial anus, while at the same time the intussusceptum is invaginated a little farther and a continuous catgut suture is inserted through the sero-muscular coats at this newly formed neck. The object of the formation of an artificial anus is to remove one of the causes of the patient's death—namely, obstruction and absorption of fa;cal material—• and to give time for separation of the gangrenous intussusceptum without perforation at the neck. The artificial anus can be closed subsequently. Fig. 132.—Barker's Operation for Intussusception completed. The vertical incision in the intussuscipiens has been closed.

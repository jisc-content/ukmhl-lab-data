575 HEMORRHOIDS the parts still further. A cautery of suitable shape (see Fig. 191, C) is then applied at a dull red heat and made to sear off the pile gradually (see Fig. 192). It is best not to snip off the portion of the pile projecting beyond the clamp before applying the cautery, as is sometimes done ; by searing off the whole mass a thicker eschar is obtained, and bleeding is more effectually guarded against. When the projecting portion of the pile has been burnt off, the seared surface is dried and a second cautery at a low red heat is rubbed over it slowly and thoroughly so as to obtain the thickest possible eschar (see Fig. 193), and is the best preventive against bleeding. A Paquelin cautery is unsuitable for this operation, as it is difficult to keep it at the low heat that is required. If a cautery Fig. 193.â€”The Clamp and Cautery Operation for I'iles. 1 he cauterised pile. The left-hand figure shows the appearance of the pile after the portion grasped in the forceps has been seared off; the right-hand one shows the appearance after it has been seared down with a second cautery and just before the blades of the clamp are released. is used at a higher temperature than a dull red heat it cuts like a knife, does not sear the vessels properly, and there may be troublesome haemorrhage when the clamp is relaxed. We always heat our cauteries in an ordinary fire or at the flame of a Bunsen lamp. After the surface has been thoroughly seared, the screw of the clamp is relaxed and the blades are slowly separated so as to allow the base of the pile to escape piece by piece. Should there be any sign of bleeding, the blades can be pressed together again at once and a fresh cautery applied. If, however, the original cauterisation has been efficient, there should be no necessity for this (see Fig. 194). Each of the remaining piles is now removed in turn in a similar manner.

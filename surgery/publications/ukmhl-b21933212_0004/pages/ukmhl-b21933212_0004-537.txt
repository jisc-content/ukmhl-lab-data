505 OBTURATOR HERNIA OBTURATOR HERNIA. This is a rare form of hernia, which passes through the obturator canal and descends downwards and forwards along the outer part of the horizontal ramus of the pubis. The sac usually comes through the anterior part of the fascia over the obturator opening, and may pass either beneath the obturator externus, or over it, and beneath the pectineus and the adductor longus ; the obturator nerve and artery are usually to the outer side of the neck of the sac. The hernia, unless large, is rarely noticeable in the thigh, and in the strangulated form the nature of the case may only be discovered after the abdomen has been opened for acute intestinal obstruction ; pain along the obturator nerve and tenderness in the groin are generally present. The hernia is very tightly nipped, and, in most cases, the intestine has been found to be gangrenous. Treatment.â€”If an obturator hernia is diagnosed, the only treatment is by operation, because a truss cannot be satisfactorily applied. The best way of dealing with these cases is to perform a median sub-umbilical laparotomy with the patient in the Trendelenburg position ; and in addition, to make a vertical incision four or five inches long over the inner border of the pectineus, separating that muscle from the adductor longus in order to expose the obturator foramen. An attempt is made to remove the sac, partly from the thigh wound and partly from the abdomen. If this is impossible, its neck should be divided between ligatures and the stump pushed up from below. In strangulated cases recovery has followed pulling up the gangrenous intestine through a median laparotomy opening, resecting the gangrenous portion and anastomosing the ends of the intestine. If it is necessary to enlarge the obturator foramen this is most safely done by cutting inwards.

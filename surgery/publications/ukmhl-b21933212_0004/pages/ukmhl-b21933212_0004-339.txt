CANCER 307 must be well over towards the cardiac end. A long powerful clamp, such as Kocher's (see Fig. iii) is now laid along the proposed line of section of the stomach—namely, from the left end of the lesser curvature to the middle of the greater curvature (see Fig. 112, A)—and closed firmly. A second clamp is then applied, a little to the distal side of this, and the stomach divided between them, either with the scissors or cautery, as the surgeon prefers. The next step is to close the divided end of the stomach by a con- tinuous stout catgut suture, taking up all the coats ; this closes the stomach cavity and at the same time compresses oozing points. The Fig. 112,—Various Methods of performing Pyloro-gastrectomv. In the first figure. A, is shown the lines of incision for removing the growth, while the others indicate different methods by which the continuity of the intestinal canal is restored subsequently. The metliod shown in E—namely, invagination of the duodenum followed by posterior gastro-jejunostomy—is tlic one most to be recommended. occluding suture is then buried b}' a fine continuous sero-muscular suture. All that now remains to be done is to remove all glands that lie above the pancreas, clean up the operation area carefully, and close the abdomen. After-treatment.—This is precisely the same as for gastro-jejunostomy (see p. 275). The shock is nearly always profound, but is not so grave as might be anticipated from the severity of the operation. It is generally advisable to introduce a quantity of saline solution into both axillte and also to start saline injection into the rectum by tlie drop method. X 2

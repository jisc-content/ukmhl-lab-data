CHAPTER XXXVIII. 549 PERI-RECTAL INFLAMMATION AND ITS SEQUELS. PERI-PROCTITIS. Inflammation may spread from the interior of the rectum through its walls into the tissues around, or it may arise primarily in the peri-rectal tissues. There are two forms, both of which end in suppuration—namely, diffuse suppurative peri-proctitis (in other words, septic cellulitis of the pelvis) and localised peri-rectal or ischio-rectal abscess. DIFFUSE SUPPURATIVE PERI-PROCTITIS. This generally follows infection from the rectum, but may arise in alcoholic or diabetic persons without injury of the bowel or preceding proctitis ; it may follow the opening up of the planes of cellular tissue in injuries or in operations such as excision of the rectum or division of a stricture. The cellulitis usually commences above the insertion of the levator ani, and may spread in the cellular tissue in the hollow of the sacrum right up to the iliac fossae. The tissues become infiltrated with pus, and sloughing occurs rapidly and may be very extensive should the patient survive for any length of time. Death generally occurs from septicaemia or pyaemia. The disease usually sets in early after an operation, some- times the same evening, and is accompanied by high temperature, delirium, and vomiting. The wound becomes extremely fretid and assumes a greyish appearance, and the pus is sanious, while the patient gradually falls into the typhoid condition, and death occurs in from three to ten days. This form is closely allied to the idiopathic gan- grenous peri-proctitis described by Mr. Furneaux Jordan {Brit. Med. Journ., 1879, vol. i. p. 73). TREATMENT.—Nothing is of much avail when once the con- dition has set in, and therefore every effort must be made to diminish

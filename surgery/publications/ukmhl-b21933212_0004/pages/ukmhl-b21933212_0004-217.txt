185 CARCINOMA cardiac end. This opening should be large enough to admit a No. 12 catheter with ease. A steriHsed red-rubber (Jaques's) catheter of this size is the most convenient and the tip is introduced into the orifice in the stomacli ; the remainder is laid along the wall of the stomach running from left to right. A piece of india-rubber tubing is fixed over the outer end of the catheter so that, should the patient vomit, the gastric contents are conveyed away from the wound and do not soil it. The serous and muscular coats of the stomach are now brought up over the catheter on each side by means of Lembert's sutures (see Fig. 66) so as to form a tube about an inch and a half or two inches long ; enough of the stomach wall on each side must be taken up to obviate any tension Fig. 66.â€”Witzel's Gastrostomy. Formation of Ike sloinach tube. The sketch shows the tip of the catheter inserted into the.opening in the stomach, and four mattress sutures in place and ready to fold the stomach wall up round the catheter. on the stitches. Outside this row is applied a second continuous sero muscular suture which should be carried well beyond the point of entrance of the tube into the stomach so as to prevent leakage (see Fig. 67). The next step is to fix the outer end of this tube of stomach wall to the opening in the abdominal parietes. The peritoneum is sutured above and below leaving a small hole about the centre of the incision through which the tube and the outer portion of stomach folded round it emerges (see Fig. 68). In sewing up the upper portion of the peritoneum it is well to insert two or three of the sutures through the stomach wall as well, so as to bring the line of sutures forming the stomach tube well up beneath the incision. The two opposed surfaces will then become adherent and form an additional means of closing in the tube and will at the same time anchor the stomach firmly to the abdominal wall so that

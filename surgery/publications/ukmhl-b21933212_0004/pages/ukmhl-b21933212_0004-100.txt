CHAPTER VIII. 68 NON-MALIGNANT TUMOURS OF THE TONGUE. Simple tumours of the tongue are rare. Lipomata and fibromata are sometimes met with and must be enucleated if the diagnosis is made ; in a doubtful case it is advisable to cut down and ascertain the nature of the growth before performing a set excision, as the simple removal of a non-malignant tumour will suffice for a cure. N^VUS. Naevus of the tongue may be either capillary or venous ; it is usually unilateral. These tumours may not give rise to any trouble if they are small, the chief accident to which the patient is liable being haemorrhage if the growth is injured ; septic thrombosis may follow the injury. When, however, a venous naevus affects a considerable area of the tongue and increases in size, great enlargement of the organ ensues and the tongue constantly gets in the way of the teeth and is wounded, the patient being thus exposed to the risk of serious haemorrhage and septic infection. TREATMENT.â€”This must vary with the extent and progress of the affection and also with its situation. When the ncevus is stationary and is situated on the dorsum, there is rarely any need for operative interference. The tumour should be watched, and should only be operated upon if it increases in size. Should it do so, the best plan, when the growlh is quite small, is to destroy it with the actual cautery at a dull red heat so as to sear the vessels and not to cut through them. When the ncsvus is on the side of the tongue and is small, it is liable to be bitten and it should be excised, even though it may not be increasing in size. This can be done by a wedge-shaped incision so planned as to go well clear of the dilated vessels. A few ligatures may be required, but as a rule the haemorrhage soon ceases when the sides of the wedge are brought together by catgut sutures inserted deeply. Before inserting the

239 CHAPTER XVI. INJURIES OF THE STOMACH : FOREIGN BODIES. INJURIES. Injuries of the stomach may be caused by blows, crushes, stabs, or bullet wounds, and vary widely in their results. Contusions of the stomach give rise to lesions varying from superficial bruising to damage severe enough to end in local gangrene. The stomach may also be ruptured partially or completely, the rupture being more likely to occur when the viscus is distended than when it is empty. In the less severe cases there is a simple contusion of the stomach wall ; in the more severe, one of the coats of the viscus—usually the peritoneal covering—may be ruptured, or there may be a complete rupture of the stomach wall with extravasation of its contents. In the case of stabs and gunshot wounds, there is usually perforation of the stomach wall. These perforations vary from mere punctures— such as those produced by high velocity bullets—to clean-cut or contused wounds. They are most common on the lesser curvature near the pylorus. When the stomach has been ruptured and the opening is large, the contents escape freely into the abdominal cavity ; when, however, the opening is small this may not occur, for the mucous membrane may prolapse through the opening and occlude a small wound sufficiently to prevent immediate escape of the gastric contents, especially if the organ be empty at the time of the injury. If this prolapse is slight, localised peritonitis will occur around the opening which may thus become adherent to any structure situated in its immediate neighbourhood ; in this case the connection between the abdominal cavity and the interior of the organ may be rapidly shut off and the patient may recover. These injuries may be grouped under two headings :— I. Non-perforating wounds, in which the mucous membrane of the

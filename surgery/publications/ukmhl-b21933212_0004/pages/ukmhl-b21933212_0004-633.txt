CANCER 6oi over with pure carbolic acid so as to render it aseptic for a time. The actual cautery may be employed both to cut the bowel across and to sear the lower end afterwards, but it is apt to burn the silk ligature ; if it is used, a clamp must be employed and the ligature applied afterwards. The ligature becomes detached in about four days, but up to that time it prevents the escape of faeces from the bowel, and healing will have advanced very considerably in the wound, and thus the chances of ex- tensive septic infection are much diminished. We have had several cases in which healing by first intention has taken place throughout. The disadvantage of this plan is that the patient may have considerable inconvenience since flatus cannot escape, but this is not as a rule very serious if the bowels have been well cleared out before the operation ; if it becomes unbearable the ligature can always be cut across and removed. The other plan is to cut across the bowel, taking precautions against Fig. 203.â€”Method of using Paul's Tube for Excision of the Rectum. The bowel has been brought out and sutured to the skin and a PauVs tube has been tied into its projecting end. soiling the wound, and then to tie in a Paul's tube, the lower end of which is fitted with the usual soft collapsible rubber tubing (see Fig. 203), and left projecting through the dressing. The Paul's tube separates about the fourth day, but in the meantime it allows the escape of gas, and of any fluid faeces which may be present, without any soiling of the wound taking place while it is in situ. In both plans about an inch of bowel is left protruding from the anus and this is trimmed off about a week after the operation. After-treatment.- An injection of morphine is administered after the

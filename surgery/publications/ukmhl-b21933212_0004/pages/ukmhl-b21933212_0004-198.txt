AFFECTIONS OF THE (ESOPHAGUS i66 been securely seized. It may even be necessary to break up the foreign body, e.g., a tooth-plate, before it can be extracted. When an oesophagoscope is not available other methods must be employed. When high up in the oesophagus or partly in the oesophagus and partly in the pharynx, attempts may be made to remove the body with forceps (see Fig. 59). In the case of small, smooth bodies the administration of an emetic, such as a subcutaneous injection of apomor- phine hydrochloride (gr. -J) may lead to the expulsion of the foreign body, but this method should not be employed unless the foreign body is quite Fig. 59.—OESOPHAGEAL Forceps.

The horse-hair ' brush ' is made to expand (see dotted line) by pulling upon the whale- bone end. small and free of projections. The same remark applies to the inversion of young children. When the foreign body is sharp and pointed and not opaque to the X-rays, such as a fish-bone, the umbrella or sweep's-brush probang of Fergusson (see Fig. 60) is useful. The instrument is passed closed beyond the supposed situation of the foreign body in the same manner as the ordinary probang. It is well to pass it to its full length, so that its lower end reaches the cardiac orifice of the stomach. By traction upon the whale-bone end, the sweep's brush is then made to project and the expanded instrument is withdrawn. The bristles catch and dislodge the foreign body, which becomes entangled in them and is withdrawn through the mouth. Extreme gentleness is essential.

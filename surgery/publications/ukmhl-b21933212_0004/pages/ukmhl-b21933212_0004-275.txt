243 INJURIES Repair of the injury to the stomach.—The stomach is brought well out through the abdominal wound, the edges of the rupture are seized with catch forceps and pulled well up, and the injured area is isolated from the rest of the peritoneal cavity by packing sterilised abdominal cloths around and beneath it so as to prevent further gastric contents hnding their way into the abdominal cavity. It is well to mop out the remaining contents of the stomach and inspect its interior in order to make sure that no wound has occurred elsewhere in the organ ; if necessary the wound in the stomach should be enlarged for this purpose. Any torn edges and projecting Fig. 89.—Suture or a Wound of the Stomach Wall.—The enrls of the wound are put on the stretch by traction, and are also raised well above the surrounding area. It is thus easy to suture the wound without the stomach contents escaping. tags of mucous membrane are then clipped away and the sides of the rent sewn together by a continuous through-and-through suture of catgut taking up ah the coats of the stomach. A blunt hook placed at each end of the cut will prevent the line being puckered up as the suture is tightened and will also pievent the escape of the stomach contents (see Fig. 89), but if there is not sufficient assistance, the cut edges can be seized in a clamp and through-and-through sutures passed around it and tightened up as the clamp is withdrawn. This deep suture checks the bleeding from the cut surfaces and is buried by a continuous Lembert's suture of finer catgut, taking up only the serous and muscular R 2

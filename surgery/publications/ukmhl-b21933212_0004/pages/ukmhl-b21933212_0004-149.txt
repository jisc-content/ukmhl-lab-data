117 LUDWIG'S ANGINA a careful watch must, therefore, be kept on both sides, and the tissues must be opened up on the slightest sign of brawniness. When the tongue itself and the floor of the mouth are brawny, free incisions must be made in that situation also (see p. 56). In doing so care should be taken to avoid the lingual nerve and Wharton's duct (see p. 114). The incisions here should only go through the mucous membrane ; the forceps are then used to open up the deeper tissues. On account of the difficulty of drainage, incisions in the mouth should not be made unless definitely called for. The general treatment of diffuse cellulitis (see Vol. I. p. 37) must accompany these procedures ; quinine in large doses (gr. xv. three or four times a day) is valuable. In spite of the free incisions it is not uncommon to find that the obstruction to respiration is so great as to call for intubation or tracheotomy. Whenever it is possible, intuhation (see Vol. V.) should be preferred, as a tracheotomy wound almost unavoidably becomes infected, especially when the neck has been laid open freely, and septic pneumonia of a most grave type is liable to set in. At the same time, however, intubation is not always feasible as the swelling may not be limited to the glottis, but may occur actually in the larynx. Under these circumstances, we prefer to use a Hahn's or Trendelenburg's tube for the first twenty-four or forty-eight hours, so as to minimise the risk of the introduction of septic material into the air-passages beside the tube.

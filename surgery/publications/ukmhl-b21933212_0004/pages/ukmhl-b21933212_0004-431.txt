399 INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS In the secondary stage an acute catarrhal enteritis may occur, and in the tertiary stage gummatous ulcers have been met with. Syphilitic strictures occur both in hereditary and acquired syphilis, most commonly in the upper part of the small intestine, but also lower down and occasionally in the colon. They are generally multiple and surround the intestine like tuberculous ulcers. With the exception of tlie catarrhal enteritis in the secondary stage, the diagnosis of syphilitic ulceration of the intestine is extremely difficult and often impossible. The symptoms closely resemble those of tuberculous ulceration of the intestine, and if they occur in a patient beyond thirty-five years of age and are accompanied by other syphilitic lesions, and the Wasserman reaction is positive, and, further, if they have existed for a considerable time and no definite symptoms of any other condition such as malignant or tuberculous disease are present, syphilis may be suspected. The treatment will be that of syphilis, and operative intervention will only be required if strictures have formed.

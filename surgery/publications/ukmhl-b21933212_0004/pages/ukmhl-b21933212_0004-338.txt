3o6 AFFECTIONS OF THE STOMACH connection with the pylorus. If the stomach is now turned well over to the left the coeliac axis will be exposed, and the coronary artery is ligatured and divided. Before proceeding to divide the stomach, it is a good plan to perform Fig. iio.—Crushing Clamps for Intestinal Resection. The upper figure shows a very powerful type by which the thickest parts of the intestine are easily reduced to the thickness of tissue paper. The dotted line shows the position of the upper handle when the forceps are closed. The lower figure is a useful form for all small intestine resections. Fig. III.—Kocher's Pylorectomy Clamp Forceps. There is a catch at the ends of the blades to maintain the pressure and to prevent any portion of the stomach wall escaping from their grasp. the gastro-jejunostomy, as it is done much more easily than after the bulk of the organ has been removed. The operation is quite similar to that described on p. 265 ; the only important point to remember is that there must be plenty of room between the anastomosis and the proposed line of section of the stomach—in other words, the anastomosis

587 PROLAPSE bowel down as far as it will come. The suture material should be stout catgut or silkworm-gut ; the ends of the sutures should be left long so that they may be identified and removed subsequently. We have treated several cases in this way with success, and complete control over the bowel has been regained. At the same time the operation is severe and should only be employed for bad cases in which a considerable amount of the entire wall of the bowel is protruded. Colopexy.â€”Attempts to shorten the prolapsed portion by suturing the bowel to tlie abdominal wall have often been made. Unless the operation is done very carefully and very thoroughly the union is apt to stretch and the prolapse to recur. Further, the operation does not affect the portion of the prolapse that is caused by the sliding of the mucous membrane over the submucous tissue, so that, in order to make the operation complete, removal of the prolapsed portion of the mucous membrane must also be carried out if it is not reduced by pulling up the rectal wall. The operation consists in opening the abdominal cavity just above the left groin, seizing the lower part of the pelvic colon and pulling it up as far as it will go so as to exert traction upon the rectum. The parietal peritoneum is then divided in the iliac fossa, the edges separated, and the bowel laid down over the raw place ; the peritoneum is then stitched to it on each side. The suturing must be very carefully carried out over as extensive an area as possible. It is important not to interfere either with the lumen of the bowel or with its blood-supply. The abdomen is then closed in the usual manner, and the after-treatment is the same as after an ordinary laparotomy. Any protrusion of mucous membrane that occurs subsequently must be dealt with separately, the best plan being to remove it, as in Whitehead's operation for piles (see p. 569).

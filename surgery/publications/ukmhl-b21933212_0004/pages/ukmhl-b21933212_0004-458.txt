426 AFFECTIONS OF THE INTESTINES adhesion of the intestines, thus shutting off the septic area. The introduc- tion of drainage tubes alone does not seem to be enough ; they do not lead to rapid adhesions around and the infection may spread to the general cavity. On the other hand, if the drainage tubes are packed round with gauze the area is quickly shut off. It is remarkable how quickly adhesions form when the peritoneum is in contact with gauze ; the intestines will be sticking together sometimes in fifteen to twenty minutes. Fig. 150.â€”The dressing applied for a case of Suppurative Appendicitis. The tube is seen in tlie centre, and around this is the gauze packed in between it and the large outside sheet of gauze, which is put in first and shuts off the operation area from the peritoneal cavity. whereas it may be hours before this occurs with tubes alone. We have tried both plans, and almost the only cases in which infection has spread have been those in which we have simply introduced drainage tubes and have not employed gauze packing in addition. No doubt the removal of the packing is not an easy matter, but with care and patience it can be done quite safely. The following is the best plan of introducing the packing. Take a largish single layer of gauze, and in the middle of it place the end of a large drainage tube. As the tube is inserted into the wound, it carries the gauze with it and when it has

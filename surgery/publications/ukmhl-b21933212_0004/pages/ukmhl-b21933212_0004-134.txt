AFFECTIONS OF THE TONGUE 102 region and the anterior triangle must be cleared out. For this purpose the incision through the skin should be free, and no attempt should be made to avoid scarring the neck. The incision should commence about the level of the lobule of the ear and run along the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid muscle to the lower part of the neck. When enlarged glands are present it may be carried down to the sterno-clavicular joint; when there are none it need not go quite so far. Another incision Fig. 37.—Incisions for Clearance of the Glandular Area of the side of the Neck. The diagram shows the long straight incision (4) along the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid, and (i) the second incision—which is really a little curved in practice —running from it to the symphysis. When there is any considerable enlargement of the glands a third incision is made opposite the figure 3 but running backwards across the sterno-mastoid, which is subsequently divided. 2 is the lower border and 3 the angle of the lower jaw.—{Biillin, ' Diseases of the Tongue.') must be carried forwards from the anterior part of the vertical incision so as to expose the submaxillary region. This begins about the level of the upper border of the thyroid cartilage and runs forwards and somewhat upwards along the hyoid bone, curving upwards to reach the lower jaw (see Fig. 37). From the upper part of this incision and a little below the level of the tip of the mastoid process, another incision should be carried backwards to beyond the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid muscle. This is especially necessary when the glands are enlarged, because it is advisable to divide the sterno-mastoid muscle transversely above the point at which the spinal accessory nerve enters

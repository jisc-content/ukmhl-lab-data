519 DIVISION IV. THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE RECTUM AND ANUS. CHAPTER XXXIII. ANATOMY OF THE RECTUM AND ANUS: METHODS OF EXAMINATION. ANATOMY. From an operative point of view the old anatomical description of the rectum is the most useful. In that description the rectum was said to be a continuation of the sigmoid flexure, to begin opposite the left sacro- iliac synchondrosis, to terminate at the anus, and to be about 8 inches in length. In the follo\\ing pages our remarks refer to the lower eight inches of the bowel. At the present time anatomists speak of the pelvic colon (formerly in great part the sigmoid flexure and in part the upper portion of the rectum), the rectum, and the anal canal The pelvic colon forms a loop about i6 inches in length, and normally lies within the pelvis. It is completely surrounded by peritoneum which forms a mesentery. The rectum proper begins at the level of the third sacral vertebra and ends at the anal canal about an inch in front of the tip of the coccyx ; it is about 5 inches in length. Above, the peritoneum covers it in front and at the sides, and lower down in front only ; it is then reflected on to the vagina in the female and the bladder in the male. In the female this point of reflection is about 2|- inches above the anal canal ; in the male it is higherâ€”about 3 inches. The rectum is surrounded by a dense tube of fascia which contains also fat, lymphatic glands, and blood-vessels ;

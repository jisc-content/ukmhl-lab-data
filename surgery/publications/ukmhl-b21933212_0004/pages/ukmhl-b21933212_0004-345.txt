JEJUNAL ULCER 313 has accumulated there evacuated. Tubes are put in in both places, and also one in the left iliac region. Gastro-jejunostomy need not be per- formed at the time unless the closure of the ulcer unduly constricts the lumen of the duodenum. The details of the treatment are the same as for perforated gastric ulcer (see p. 285). When the ulcer has become adherent to other structures before the intestinal wall has been eaten through, an abscess may form, which burrows especially backwards, and may result in a duodenal fistula after bursting or being opened. If this persists, something must be done, and gastro-jejunostomy with closure of the pylorus is the line of treatment which seems most suitable. JEJUNAL ULCER. An ulcer may form in the jejunum, either at the line of junction of the stomach and jejunum in the case of gastro-jejunostomy, or lower down in the jejunum itself ; the great majority occur at the line of the anastomosis, perhaps most frequently after the anterior form of the operation. The ulcers are often acute, and may appear within a few days after the operation, and they are very apt to perforate. Some are more chronic and present symptoms similar to those of the original trouble. Their cause is indefinite ; they may be due to the same cause as pro- duced the original ulcer, and they have been attributed to the presence of an unabsorbed suture at the line of junction, or to a heematoma. The treatment is very difficult. The ulcer, if perforated, may be closed, or, whether perforated or not, it may be advisable to resect the portion of bowel involved. This may mean excision of the line of union with the stomach ; if this is done, a fresh union may be made at a lower level, and the upper limb implanted into the lower, forming a sort of Y-operation. For information about this rare condition, the work on Duodenal Ulcer, by Sir B. G. A. Moynihan, may be consulted.

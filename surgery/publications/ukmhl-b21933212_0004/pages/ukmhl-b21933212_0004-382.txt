AFFECTIONS OF THE INTESTINES 350 however, the infant is in perfect health up to the moment of invagination of the bowel, and very often is quite a robust child. In young infants there is generally some abnormality of the bowel present, and in older children and in adults the invagination is not infrequently brought about by the presence of foreign bodies in the bowel or growths in its wall. In the latter case it is particularly the polypoid forms, ■ which, hanging into the bowel, lead to irritation and irregular contraction, so that the polypus is dragged down and pulls the bowel after it; occasionally it occurs in connection with Henoch's purpura, in wliich there is an Fig. 130.—Diagram to illustrate the arrange- ment OF THE LAYERS IN AN INTUSSUSCEPTION. The upper figure shows a longitudinal section, the lower a horizontal one ; a is the intussuceptum, between which and the reflected portion b is the mesentery d; c is the intussuscipiens. i, 2, and 3 are the mucous, muscular, and serous coats respectively. extravasation of blood into the wall of the bowel. A Meckel's diverti- culum,, or the appendix may be invaginated and lead to the formation of an intussusception. Carcinomatous growths are sometimes the exciting cause of the condition in elderly people. The size of the intus- susception may vary very greatly, and the apex of the intussusceptum may actually protrude from the anus. Pathological changes.—An intussusception" consists of three parts: the intussusceptum, or the part drawn in ; the intussuscipiens, or the sheath or receiving layer ; and the reflected portion, or the part of the intussuscipiens which is bent upon itself (see Fig. 130).

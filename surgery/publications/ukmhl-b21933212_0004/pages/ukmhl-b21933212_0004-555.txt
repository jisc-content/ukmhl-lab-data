METHODS OF EXAMINATION 523 over the edge. The tube, with the obturator in position and well warmed and lubricated, is inserted gently through the anus, the point being first directed backwards into the hollow of the sacrum. As soon as it has passed well within the anus the obturator is withdrawn, the electric lamp substituted, and the light switched on. Then the hand-bellows are worked, and the eye applied to the eyepiece. As the inflation proceeds, the rectum is distended, its walls and folds separate, and it can be seen in what direction the tube should be passed. It is gently pushed on, Fig. 176.—Sigmoidoscope. Above is seen the tube carrying an electric light in its interior and furnished with a bellows for inflation. Immediately beneath this is the obturator, and below this again a pair of forceps for manipulations inside the tube. while the inflation is kept up, until it has passed to its full length or until its passage is obstructed by some obstacle, the nature of which may be made out by direct vision. The eyepiece is removable for the purpose of introducing forceps in order to remove portions of tissue, or mop away faecal matter or mucus. If the bowels have been cleared out thoroughly beforehand—as should always be the case—very little faecal material gets into the tube. In the hands of anyone accustomed to use it, this instrument is of great value, and has led to the early recognition of many lesions—such as cancer of the bowel—situated in the pelvic colon too high up to be felt from below and too hidden under the prominence of the sacrum to be felt by abdominal palpation. There are certain points which must be attended to in order to ensure success. The bowels must be well cleared out and the greatest gentleness must be used throughout, otherwise the instrument may be forced through the bowel wall and enter the peritoneal cavity. Under no circumstances should any attempt be made to pass the tube onwards

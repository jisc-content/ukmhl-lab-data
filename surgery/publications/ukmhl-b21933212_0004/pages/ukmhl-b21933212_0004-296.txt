AFFECTIONS OF THE STOMACH 264 feeble subjects. Spinal analgesia may also be used, but there is often some difficulty in regulating the administration so as to get a sufficiently high limit of analgesia; besides this, the patient, though quite unconscious of pain, may suffer a good deal of shock from the disturbance of the large sympathetic plexuses. Spinal analgesia is especially valuable when the operation is done for a perforated gastric or duodenal ulcer. The incision should be vertical, commencing above, about an inch to the right of the middle line and carried downwards to the level of the umjbilicus. The abdominal cavity having been opened in the manner Fig. 93.â€”Posterior Gastro-jejunostomv. Identificalion of the Jejunum. The stomach and weat omentum have been turned up on to the chest and covered with an abdominal cloth. The under surface of the transverse meso-colon covering the posterior surface of the stomach is fully displayed, and the fossa duodeno-jejunal is is well seen. The coil of small intestine grasped by the hand is the commencement of the jejunum. aheady described (see p. 215), the anterior surface of the stomach, which either presents spontaneously or is readily exposed by pushing down the colon, is explored for the presence of an ulcer, and if one is found, it should be carefully examined to see if it can be excised (see p. 279). If so, this may be done, and the wound in the stomach either closed by sutures, or, if in a suitable position and of convenient size, subsequently utilised as part of an anterior gastro-jejunostomy. Whether the ulcer be excised or not, the next step is the identification of the jejunum (see Fig. 93). The omentum and the transverse colon are raised and pulled well up out of the abdominal wound, when it is usually easy to identify the first few inches of the jejunum just after its junction

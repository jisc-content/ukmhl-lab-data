TREATMENT AFTER LAPAROTOMY be separated instead of being divided. When, however, tliere is a large abscess for which drainage througli a wide opening has to be provided, it is not possible to do this efficiently through any incision which simply separates the muscles, as the tube is apt to be nipped and proper drainage thereby defeated. Hence we are accustomed in the first place to make a free incision through the skin, which of itself is a matter of no consequence, then to separate the muscles over the spot at which the abdomen is to be opened, in the manner already described, so as to expose the peritoneum. This is then opened, and the finger is made to penetrate the abscess by separating the adherent structures immediately beneath, and proper drainage is provided for by large drainage tubes. In order to prevent Fio. 85.—SuiiiRE OF Muscles by the Mattress Stuck. Xhis suture is used when the muscular fibres luve been divided transversely. these being too tightly grasped by the muscles, the latter should be divided transversely sufficiently to leave a free passage. By proceeding in this manner the least possible damage is done to the abdominal wall, and in fact the only weak spot left is the hole through which the tube comes. Unfortunately, in a good many cases—especially when the abdominal walls are flabby—this defect in the wall remains after healing, and protrusion is apt to occur and may necessitate an operation for its closure, but the method has the advantage that if a hernia does occur, it is through a small aperture instead of being a general bulging of the scar as was formerly common. When the abscess has not yet reached and become adherent to the abdominal wall, the method of opening and dealing with it is much more complicated, but this is fully considered in the chapter on appendicitis.

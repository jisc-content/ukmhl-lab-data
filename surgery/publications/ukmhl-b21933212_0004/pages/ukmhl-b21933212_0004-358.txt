326 AFFECTIONS OF THE INTESTINES should begin at the mesenteric border and be carried right round the gut. Especial care must be taken opposite the mesenteric attachment to see that the suture takes in the muscular coat, which is apt to retract in this situation. The suture may be inserted either with a curved or a straight needle. When this suture has been inserted properly, accurate coaptation of the cut surfaces is assured and the intestinal canal is shut off. The Lembert suture is now continued outside this one (see Fig. ii8). This suture should not be more than one-eighth of an inch away from the inner continuous one, otherwise a partial diaphragm will be formed Fig. 117.—End-to-end Union of the Intes- Fig. 118.—End-to-end Union of the Intes- tine.

The aperture in the mesentery must now be closed, and when the mesenteric border has been merely detached from the intestine, the projecting line of mesentery which is left when the ends of the bowel are brought together should be sewn together, as shown in Fig. 119. When a V-shaped piece has been removed the edges of the V are simply stitched together. This completes the anastomosis ; all that remains to be done is to remove the clamps, clean up the area of the operation, and drop back the loop into the abdominal cavity, which is then closed. Some surgeons have strongly advocated the use of omental grafts around the line of union (see p. 224). In the majority of cases, however, there seems to be no reason for employing these grafts, whilst their use

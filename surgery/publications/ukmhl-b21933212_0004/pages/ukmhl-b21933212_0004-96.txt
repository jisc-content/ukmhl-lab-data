CHAPTER VII. 64 SYPHILIS AND TUBERCULOSIS OF THE TONGUE. SYPHILIS. Lingual syphilis is very common, and all stages of the disease may be met with. A primary chancre is rare on the tongue ; when it affects the mouth it generally occurs on the lip or in the region of the tonsil. On the tongue it is usually situated towards the tip or the anterior part of the dorsum. Mucous patches are extremely common in the course of secondary syphilis, and may be met with on any part of the tongue, most frequently about its borders. They may occur also in the congenital form of the disease and are usually multiple and accompanied by other manifesta- tions of the disease elsewhere. The patches vary in appearance according to their situation ; on the side of the tongue, they form elongated or oval areas and are often fissured or ulcerated in the centre and very painful; on the dorsum the ulceration is not so marked, and the patch is generally smooth, with whitish margins ; on the under surface of the tongue they may present the warty appearance of the typical mucous patch. In tertiary syphilis sclerosing glossitis (localised areas of inflammation with thickening of the tissues beneath) or typical gummata may be met with. The first form causes deep fissures and ulcers on the tongue which are very typical. In the earlier stages they give rise to thickened patches of variable size with a white appearance, which somewhat resemble leucoplakia ; these areas are often fissured or ulcerated. The most frequent form of tertiary lesion is a gumma. Gummata occur either on the surface of the tongue or deep in the muscular tissue ; the more deeply seated forms are usually near the middle line. They may be single or multiple, and gradually break down and lead to a comparatively deep conical ulcer, with a foul sloughy surface, and without the hard everted edge that is typical of epithelioma. There is often

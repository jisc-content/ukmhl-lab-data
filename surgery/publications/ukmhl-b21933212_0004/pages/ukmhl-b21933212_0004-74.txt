42 AFFECTIONS OF THE JAWS tissues are removed with scissors or cutting-pliers, or destroyed freely with the thermo-cautery. The skin wound is then united accurately as in Fergusson's operation (see p. 37). No drainage tube or packing is required. The post-nasal plug is removed as soon as the patient is conscious, when he is treated exactty as after Fergusson's operation. 3. Of cases in which the growth is primarily Alveolar.—When the disease spreads to the body of the upper jaw from the alveolus the extent of the operation will vary within very wide limits, and will depend upon the size of the growth, and the amount of implication of the Fig. 18.—^The Lines of Incision in the Bone in Lateral Rhinotomy. jaw. In the mildest cases—usually those in which the growth arises in connection with a carious tooth or a badly-fitting denture—it may suffice to remove only the subjacent alveolus and palate process without opening the antral cavity. But in the cases generally seen, it will be necessary to open the antrum freely, remove most, if not all, of the palate process, and as much as may be necessary of the anterior and outer walls of the antrum, so as to get wide of the growth. In aU cases the incision through the muco-periosteum should be at least half an inch wide of the margin of the growth all round. The operation is simple. No packing is required until the wound is granulating, when it is used to keep food out of the antrum. When

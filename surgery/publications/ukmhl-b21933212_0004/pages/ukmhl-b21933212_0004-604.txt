572 AFFECTIONS OF THE RECTUM AND ANUS complete—^but not tied—the forceps are removed and the running stitch pulled quite tight so as to secure all bleeding vessels ; the suture is tied when it is certain that the bleeding is controlled. The after-treatment is similar to that for the clamp and cautery operation {vide infra). In our experience this operation is satisfactory for small isolated piles, but it is usually accompanied by more pain than is the clamp and cautery method. Clamp and cautery.—^This is a very useful operation in many cases, and Fig. 190.—Forcible Dilatation of the Sphincter Ani. The dilatation figured above is that employed as a preliminary to operative procedures in which it is important that tlie sphincters should be stretched to their utmost limit. For less vigorous dilatation the thumbs may be substituted for the fingers. has the advantage of removing the piles completely, without the loss of more than a few drops of blood ; it is, therefore, especially applicable in anaemic and debilitated subjects. If properly performed, there should be little or no pain following the operation, and little or no risk of accidental or secondary h£emorrhage, nor is it likely to be followed by contraction. It is unsuited for cases of general hsemorrhoidal dilatation where more than four or five piles require removal. In these cases there is practically no alternative to the operation of excision of the pile-bearing area (vide supra). The operation is done as follows :

CHAPTER IV. 24 TUMOURS OF THE JAWS. CYSTS. It is not uncommon to find cysts in the jaws which originate in con- nection with the teeth. These cysts are of three kinds : Dentigerous cysts, simple dental cysts, and multilocular cysts. DENTIGEROUS CYSTS. These cysts are also known as Follicular odontomes. They contain a clear, somewhat mucoid fluid ; they are unilocular and have either a well-developed tooth or the rudiments of a tooth in their interior. They may occur in either jaw and usually develop in connection with the permanent teeth ; they have been found, however, in connection with the temporary teeth. They generally appear between seven and thirty years of age. They increase slowly, and gradually expand and thin the bone over them, so that in advanced cases there is the sensation known as ' eggshell crackling ' on pressure ; indeed, the bone may be actually destroyed and fluctuation may be present. In the upper jaw the cysts extend upwards and bulge into the antrum, and they also dilate the bone outwards so as to form a prominence on the cheek. They may become infected and undergo suppuration. TREATMENT.â€”The treatment consists in free removal of the cyst wall which, in most cases, can be carried out from the mouth. The mucous membrane is reflected from the swelling, the outer wall of the cyst cut away with scissors or cutting-pliers, the lining membrane of the cavity scraped out and any tooth in the interior removed. In addition to scrap- ing the cavity so as to get rid of the lining membrane of the cyst, it is well to gouge its surface thorouglfly and afterwards to sponge it with undiluted carbolic acid ; it should be stuffed hghtly with strips of cyanide gauze

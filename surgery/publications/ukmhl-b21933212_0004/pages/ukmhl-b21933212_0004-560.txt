AFFECTIONS OF THE RECTUM AND ANUS 528 diaphragm present; much more frequently the lower end of the rectum covered by peritoneum projects on to the upper part of the anal canal, and if the above operation is performed, extravasation of the intestinal contents takes place into the peritoneal cavity. Some idea may be gained as to whether it is a mere septum or not by introducing a small speculum—a nasal one serves the purpose well—and inspecting the top of the anal depression. When there is a mere diaphragm the roof is smooth, bluish in colour near the top, and somewhat convex downwards ; when, on the other hand, a fibrous cord unites the two parts the roof is A B Fig. i8o.—^The Operation for Imperforate Anus. A shows the distended lower end of the gut approached from behind after the anal depression has been slit back- wards to the coccyx. B shows how it is sutured to the wound after being opened. It is attached partly to the cut margins of the anal dimple and partly to the skin. irregular and puckered, less bluish and not convex downwards, unless the distension is great. In any case of doubt the following procedure should be adopted (see Figs. 179-181). The child is either held by the nurse or placed face downwards over a pillow so that the pelvis is raised and the hip-joints are well flexed (see Fig. 179). The surgeon sits facing the buttocks, and makes a median incision from the tip of the coccyx into the anal orifice, dividing the whole posterior wall of the anal canal, including the sphincter. He then separates the tissues in the middle line in the hollow of the sacrum and approaches the distended end of the rectum from the posterior aspect (see Fig. 180, A). A vertical incision is made into the gut, the edges seized in forceps and sutured accurately to the margins of the skin wound and the mucous membrane of the anal canal (see Fig. 180, B), and

AFFECTIONS OF THE INTESTINES 342 exposed coils are kept warm by covering them with hot abdominal cloths. The object of using a tube, instead of simply making a small opening, is to allow of the evacuation of the coils above, which may not empty them- selves at once through the opening. The tube will pass onwards more easily if lubricated with sterilised vaseline before its insertion. Before completing the operation the surgeon must be satisfied that the intestine has been thoroughly evacuated, and it may be a matter of an hour or more before it seems safe to close the opening and the abdomen. In many cases, this evacuation of the upper part of the bowel will make Fig. 125.â€”Evacuation of a distended loop of Bowel in Intestinal Obstruc- tion. The drawing shows how the glass tube is pushed on into successive loops by folding up the wall of the loop that has been emptied. all the difference between recovery of the patient and failure of the operation. When the surgeon is of opinion that the coils have been sufficiently emptied, the tube is withdrawn, the intestinal walls above and below the small opening are temporarily approximated by clamps, and the incision itself rapidly closed with a fine continuous Lembert suture. A single row will suffice if the stitch is commenced and terminated about a quarter of an inch beyond the extremities of the incision. The bowel is then carefully cleaned up, the loop dropped back into the abdomen, and the closure of the abdominal wall proceeded with (see p. 215). Fig. 126 shows

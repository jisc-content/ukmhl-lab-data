i68 AFFECTIONS OF THE (ESOPHAGUS Cervical cesophagotomy.—When the foreign body is situated above the level of the clavicle, its extraction by cesophagotomy is comparatively easy. The first point is to localise the iDody exactly, which is done either by a radiogram (if the body is opaque to the X-rays), or else by careful exploration with an oesophagoscope or an oesophageal sound. The oesophagus is then exposed through an incision along the anterior border of the left sterno-mastoid in an exactly similar manner to that given on p. 120 in connection with the operation for removal of pharyngeal pouches. Fig. 62.—CESOPHAGOTOMY. Exposure of the (Esophagus in the Neck, a, Platysnia ; b, inferior constrictor ; c, carotid sheath ; rf, cricoid cartilage ; e, oesophagus ; /, depressor muscles of the hvoid bone ; ?, recurrent laryngeal nerve ; h, thyroid gland and inferior thyroid artery ; i, sterno-mastoid muscle. When the oesophageal wall has been exposed, the recurrent laryngeal nerve, if visible, should be hooked forwards into the angle between the trachea and the oesophagus. The foreign body, if high up, may then be felt through the oesophageal wall, or, if not, an olive-headed sound should be passed down to it and a sufficiently free vertical incision is made directly over the tip of the sound. A smooth rounded body does not need a large opening, but an irregular body, such as a tooth-plate, requires an incision practically equal in length to its long axis. The edges of the incision are held apart by catch forceps, and the foreign body carefully extracted, any projecting arms or hooks being unhitched from the mucous membrane.

EPITHELIOMA 97 After the bleeding has been arrested, the raw surface should be diminished as much as possible by catgut sutures, the two halves of the jaw wired together, and the thread through the stump of the tongue fastened either to the teeth or to the wire uniting the jaw. This step is essential, as the muscles running from the tongue to the hyoid bone have been divided and the stump will otherwise fall back and may cause asphyxia. This stitch is usually required for three or four days ; when there is much tension on the thread it may cut its way through the stump too early. When there is doubt as to its holding, it is weU to keep in the laryngotomy tube so as to avoid the risk of asphyxia. This Fig. 35.â€”Syme's Excision of the Tongue. The sketch shows the method of curving the incision away on each side as it nears the hyoid bone, so as to raise flaps and remove glands. Syme used a simple median incision. is especially necessary in cases that are not in hospital ; in any case the nurse should be constantly at the bedside and should have suitable forceps at hand with which the stump can be seized and pulled forwards if necessary. When the disease actually implicates the jaw itself, a portion of the bone must be removed. It should be sawn through on either side of the disease, but left attached to and removed in one piece with the growth in the tongue. For the subsequent procedure in consequence of the removal of a portion of the jaw see p. 98. if) When the disease has spread over the floor of the mouth and involves the jaw, the whole of the infected portion IV.

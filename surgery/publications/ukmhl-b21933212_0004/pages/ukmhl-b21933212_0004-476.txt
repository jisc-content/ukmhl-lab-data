444 CHAPTER XXVIII. PERITONITIS : PERITONEAL CYSTS : ASCITES. Inflammation of the peritoneum may be acute or chronic. The acute forms are usually associated with infection of the peritoneal cavity by pyogenic organisms, and practically alwaj's end in suppuration which may be diffuse or localised. The chronic forms may occur in connection with tuberculosis, ulcers of the intestine, echinococcus cysts, diverticula from the bowel, new growths, and so forth. LOCALISED SUPPURATIVE PERITONITIS. We have already considered local peritoneal suppuration in speaking of appendicitis, diverticulitis, and ulcer of the stomach and duodenum. It may also occur in corinection \\ ith infections of the gall-bladder, the Fallopian tubes, and other parts ; these conditions are considered under their respective headings. As a rule the perforation of a hollow viscus into a healthy peritoneal cavity leads to a general diffuse peritonitis without any localisation ; when it is localised there has usually been a previous plastic peritonitis, which has led to adhesions around the point of perforation. The perforation then takes place into the midst of these adhesions, and a localised abscess ma-y result either around the seat of perforation or in the neighbourhood, or at some distance away by extension of the infection along the lymphatics, as in subphrenic abscess after appendicitis. GENERAL SUPPURATIVE PERITONITIS. From the point of view of treatment, this is one of the most terrible and most disheartening conditions that can be met with. It usually arises in connection with perforation of a viscus such as the stomach, the intestine, or the appendix. It may follow rupture of a localised collection of pus in the Fallopian tubes or elsewhere, perforation of a septic gall-bladder, or extravasation of septic urine ; it may foUow

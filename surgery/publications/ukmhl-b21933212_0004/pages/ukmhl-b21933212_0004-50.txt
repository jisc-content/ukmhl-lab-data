CHAPTER III. 18 INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS OF THE JAWS. Inflammation of the gums and jaws is most commonly associated with caries of the teeth. It may also occur from the accumulation of tartar around the neck of the teeth, from the action of drugs, such as mercury or phosphorus, from septic infections and aphthous conditions of the mouth, or in connection with specific infective diseases, such as syphilis, tubercle or actinomycosis ; it may also be associated with digestive troubles. The inflammation may be limited to the alveolar process or may affect the body of the jaw ; it may commence in the periosteum and lead to thickening of the bone, or it may begin in the substance of the bone and end in alveolar abscess or necrosis. GINGIVITIS. In inflammation of the gums from excessive administration of mercury the treatment is to stop the administration of the drug, to employ anti- septic mouth-washes, and to administer chlorate of potash in ten-grain doses three or four times a day. Chlorate of potash (gr. x ad 5j) is also an excellent mouth-wash. An aphthous condition of the mouth is not uncommonly accompanied by a similar affection of the gums ; the treatment consists in free purgation, and the employment of antiseptics, such as boro-glyceride, sanitas, or weak Condy's fluid. Glycerinum acidi carbolici diluted to I in 40 is an excellent soothing application. In secondary syphilis there is also ulceration of the gums following the formation of mucous patches upon them. The treatment is that of secondary syphilis (see Vol. I. Chap. XL). PYORRHCEA ALVEOLARIS. The most interesting of the inflammations of the gums is that known as pyorrhoea alveolaris ; it often escapes recognition or is mistaken for

558 AFFECTIONS OF THE RECTUM AND ANUS ani, scrape its walls, and insure proper drainage. If the sinus leads to bare bone in the pelvis, an attempt may be made to treat it appropriately. Should it run to the prostate or the broad ligament, the primary cause must be dealt with according to circumstances. The patient should in aU cases be kept in bed until the deeper part of the wound has healed, and the bowels should be regulated. In tuberculous fistulce it may also be advisable to attempt a radical cure. When the fistula is situated low down, the track may be divided, its walls completely removed, and the wound packed and made to heal by granulation from the bottom, but in the majority of cases it is essential to aim at healing by first intention, and therefore the operation above described should be employed. Should the fistula be extensive and complicated by numerous tortuous sinuses, or should the patient be in bad health or in the last stages of phthisis, palliative treatment alone must suffice. The track must be properly drained, however, so that infective material does not accumulate in it and give rise to fresh abscesses. The best way of insuring this is to enlarge the external opening and dilate the track right up to the bowel. The sinus is then scraped and packed from the bottom, and the bowels are so regulated that faeces do not accumulate. If this is done, the discharge will diminish in amount and the patient will be much more comfortable, while at the same time the risk of burrowing of pus and the formation of fresh sinuses is diminished.

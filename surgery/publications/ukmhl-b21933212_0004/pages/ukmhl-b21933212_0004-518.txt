AFFECTIONS OF THE INTESTINES 486 whether it is cut away or not ; to leave the remains of the sac in the inguinal canal is to leave a mass which prevents proper closure of the canal and which of itself is not a satisfactory barrier to the descent of the hernia. In direct hernia the condition is different, and frequently none of these methods can be employed ; as a rule, there is no narrow neck to the sac, and it is impossible either to twist or to purse up the neck sufficiently to ligature it. In the oblique form also, when the caecum is in the sac, portions of the latter must be put back with the intestine, and no satis- FiG. 164.—Macewen's Method of closing the Inguinal Canal in Radical Cure of Hernia. The left-hand sketch shows the method of passing the suture through the conjoined tendon, while the right-hand one shows the ends of this suture passed, one through the fascia lata of the thigh just below Poupart's ligament, and the other through the ligament itself. factory neck is left. Under these circumstances closure is best effected by cutting away the sac altogether and stitching up the peritoneum as in an ordinary laparotomy. The methods of dealing with the canal.—This question is one about which there is considerable difference of opinion. The first question —whether steps should be taken to close the canal at all—depends, we believe, on the age of the patient and the condition of the abdominal walls. There is no doubt that the essential point in the operation for radical cure is complete obliteration of the sac, but, when the abdominal walls are lax and atrophied or stretched by the prolonged existence of a large hernia, a fresh protrusion of peritoneum may occur, unless the sides of the canal are also approximated. In children, on the other hand, the

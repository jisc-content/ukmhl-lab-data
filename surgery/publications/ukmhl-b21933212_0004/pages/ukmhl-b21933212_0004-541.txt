CHAPTER XXXII. 509 ENTEROPTOSIS OR GLENARD'S DISEASE: CHRONIC CONSTIPATION. ENTEROPTOSIS. Abnormal looseness of various abdominal organs is not uncommon, and this condition may give rise to very distressing symptoms. Any of the abdominal organs may be affected either singly or together, the most common being the kidneys, liver, spleen, uterus, stomach, and intestines. We shall here consider the descent of the intestinal viscera—stomach and intestines—though this condition is frequently associated with others, especially nephroptosis and hepatoptosis. In bad cases the intestines are collected at the lower part of the abdomen, the transverse colon may cross the upper part of the pelvis, there may be no proper attachment of the hepatic and splenic flexures, and the stomach, which is often dilated, may also descend well below the umbilicus. The result of this displacement is to give rise to symptoms which often render the patient a chronic invalid ; they consist of dragging pains due to the unsupported weight of the intestines, various troubles in connec- tion with the altered position of the organs and kinking of various parts of the intestinal tract, and a general neurasthenic condition. The pyloric orifice of the stomach is displaced and may be kinked, the stomach becomes dilated, and dyspeptic symptoms and signs of pyloric obstruction are very common. Chronic constipation is often marked, and is accom- panied by mucous colitis and meteorism. There is generally also wasting and loss of strength. These patients may be very emaciated, and frequently take food badly. The statements of the patient as to pain and discomfort are often distractingly vague and variable, and are apt to lead one to look on the case as one of neurasthenia. The shape of the abdomen is often very characteristic. Gallant {International Clinics, vol. i., 15th series, 1905) has made curves of the

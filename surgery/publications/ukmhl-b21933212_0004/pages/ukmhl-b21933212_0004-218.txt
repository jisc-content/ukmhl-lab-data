AFFECTIONS OF THE OESOPHAGUS i86 there is no risk of its dragging away, as it might were it merely stitched round the opening left in the peritoneum. If this precaution is omitted it is quite possible for leakage to occur between the stomach and the abdominal wall. The circle of stomach wall emerging through the opening in the peritoneum is then sutured, first to the edge of the latter, and then to the skin ; in order to do this, the tube of stomach around the catheter is pulled well forward by an assistant. The rest of the wound is then stitched up as usual. The catheter thus passes through the skin incision along a tube formed by the folded stomach wall, and at the further end through an opening into the stomach. No regurgitation is likely to occur, as the tube will collapse when the catheter is taken out and its walls will be firmly approximated by the pressure of the stomach contents (see Fig. 69). The patient is fed upon the operating table with six ounces of milk and half an ounce of brandy, and this may be repeated every four hours. After-treatment.â€”The wound heals readily and the patient may usually be allowed to get about at the end of a fortnight. The catheter should be changed daily after the first four days, a fresh one being inserted immediately. A piece of india-rubber tubing should be attached to the end of the catheter and provided with a proper clip to prevent escape of the gastric contents ; the whole is fastened on with a binder. After about two months the tube may be left out between meals, and only inserted for purposes of feeding. It is well to provide the patient with a black olive-ended catheter for feeding purposes, as its tapering end enables it to be passed into the wound more certainly and with less risk Fig. 67.â€”Witzel's Gastrostomy. The catheter secured in position. This is done by a continuous Lembert s>iture burying the mattress sutiures.

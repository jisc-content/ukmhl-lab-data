39 TUMOURS prevent the blood running back into the pharynx. Some surgeons perform a preUminary laryngotomy and phig the pharynx, but this is unnecessary unless the operation is a very extensive one ; the posterior nares can be quite efficiently plugged in the ordinary manner (see Fig. 15). The plug consists of a firm sponge or of boric lint folded to a size that will fill up the posterior nares, and narrow enough to be pulled into it ; attached to this is a piece of silk, with both ends long. Special instruments, such as Fig. 15.â€”Plugging the Posterior Nares. The catheter is shown in place and the tliread has been pulled out of the mouth preparatory to attaching to it the string holding the post nasal plug. In practice it is simpler to tie the thread to the end of the catheter than to thread it through it as depicted above. Bellocq's sound, may be used for the introduction of the plug, but the simplest plan is to take a gum-elastic catheter of small size, pass it through the nostril into the pharynx and then, holding the mouth open, to seize the tip and pull it out of the mouth. The string is then attached to the tip of the catheter, which is withdrawn through the nose, carrying with it the string attached to the plug. The plug is drawn into the mouth, and to avoid injury of the soft palate, it is well to push it back into the pharynx

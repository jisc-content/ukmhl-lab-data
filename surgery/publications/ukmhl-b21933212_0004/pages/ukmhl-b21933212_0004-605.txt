HEMORRHOIDS 573 The bowels having been properly evacuated beforehand (see p. 554), the patient should be antesthetised and placed in the lithotomy position, the perineum shaved, and the sphincter fully dilated (see Fig. 190). This dilatation should be done most carefully, the muscles being stretched steadily to their utmost limit. The pile-bearing area then prolapses and the number of piles requiring removal is noted and suitable ring forceps c Fig. 191.—Instruments for the Clamp and Cautery Operation for Piles. ^, ring-forceps ; B, Smith's clamp ; C, cautery, with air-jacl<et round handle to prevent over-heating. (see Fig. 191, A) attached to each.

In the female the identification of the piles can be facilitated by introducing a finger into the vagina and pressing the anterior wall of the rectum downwards. The clamp is now applied to the first pile in such a manner that its long axis is parallel to that of the bowel—a most important point, the

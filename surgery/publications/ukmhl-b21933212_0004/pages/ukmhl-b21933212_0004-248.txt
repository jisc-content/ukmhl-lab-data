2i6 GENERAL REMARKS ON LAPAROTOMY and posterior sheath of the rectus are seized with tenaculum forceps, brought together by an assistant and united by a continuous suture of silk ; if an attempt is made to sew up the peritoneum separately the stitches generally cut through. The fibres of the rectus are then approxi- mated by a few interrupted catgut stitches. The anterior layer of the sheath of the rectus is next united by a button-hole silk stitch and the skin is closed by a silk suture in the ordinary manner (see Figs. 81-84). When the incisions have been made in the lateral wall of the abdomen Fig. 79.â€”Exploratory Laparotomy. Opening the peritoneal cavity. The scissors are dividing the posterior layer of the rectus sheath and the peritoneum. and the muscular fibres have been divided, great care is necessary in order to obtain a strong union, and this is especially difficult when the patient is very muscular. In the first place the peritoneum and the transversalis fascia, which are not detached from each other, are separated from the muscles and brought together by a continuous silk suture. The under surfaces of the divided transversalis and internal oblique are then brought into apposition by a series of mattress sutures of strong silk (see Fig. 85), and then the cut edges which now project forwards are united by a continuous silk suture. In some cases it is impossible to unite the

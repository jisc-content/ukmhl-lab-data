GASTRIC ULCER 283 to excise the ulcer if the conditions are suitable, and this is done in the manner described on p. 279. When the ulcer is situated on the greater curvature, the bleeding will come from one of the gastro-epiploic vessels, and it can be quickly arrested by clamping the main vessel externally on each side of the site of the ulcer ; the latter is then excised if the conditions permit (see p. 279) along with any indurated portion of the omentum about its base. The incision through the omentum should be triangular in shape with its apex downwards and its base corresponding to the ulcer on the curva- ture (see Fig. 105). When the opening in the stomach has been sutured. Fig. 105.â€”Methods of treating Ulcers situated at the Curvatures of the Stomach. The shaded areas indicate the position of the ulcers, and the dotted lines are the lines for excising them. These are partly through the stomach walls and partly through the omenta. By their means it is possible to bring the divided edges together without difficulty. one or two stitches will suffice to close the opening in the omentum. It may, however, happen that the induration is so extensive that excision of the ulcer is impossible, and under these circumstances, ligature of the gastro- epiploic artery alone will usually suffice to stop the bleeding. This may be done by passing an aneurysm needle around it or by underrunning it with a needle threaded with catgut. In the case of an ulcer on the lesser curvature the coronary artery should be dealt with in a similar manner. When the ulcer is situated on the posterior surface and is adherent to the pancreas, as is not infrequently the case, a large pancreatico-duodenal vessel may be opened, and free and even fatal haemorrhage may result. Under these circumstances the spouting vessel will generally be seen when

INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS 59 parts of vaseline with six of lanoline. The tongue is dried, a small portion of the ointment is laid upon it and is then rubbed in by the patient pressing the tongue against the hard palate and moving it to and fro. This method is specially indi- cated in those who sleep with the mouth open, and who generahy suffer from a hard, dry tongue in the morning. When the condition is associated with psoriasis elsewhere, the administration of arsenic may be beneficial, but in ordinary cases of leucoplakia the drug seems to be without effect. In bad cases—especially when an ichthyotic, or a warty or fissured condition is present—it is well to excise the affected area of mucous membrane. The mucous membrane alone needs removal, but it is well to employ wedge-shaped incisions, with their bases at the mucous surface ; this will allow the raw surfaces to be approximated by catgut stitches inserted deeply and tied firmly so as to stop the oozing by pressure. Figs. 25 and 26, taken from the late Sir Henry Butlin's article on opera- tions upon the tongue in the ' System of Operative Surgery,'1 show how patches in various situations may be excised. Cases of leucoplakia should be seen every three or four months, with the view of keeping a watch for signs of malignant disease. It is unwise to prescribe for patients with this disease and allow them to go away under the impression that everything that is required has been done. At the same time the surgeon must be careful not to frighten the patient, and no mention of epithelioma should be made to him until its presence has been declared.

268 AFFECTIONS OF THE STOMACH the sero-muscular coats only in the first instance. It is well then to separate them from the mucous membrane for a short distance on either side, leaving an elliptical portion of the latter exposed. This elliptical area is then snipped away with scissors, thus removing redundant mucous membrane and facilitating the subsequent suture. Both stomach and jejunum are treated in a similar manner. Anything that escapes from the opening is carefully wiped up on mops that are not used again during the operation. A suture of stout catgut is now taken and the adjacent lips of the openings in the stomach and the jejunum are united, the edges being approximated by catch forceps. This suture should commence at one end of the incision, and, going through all the Fig. 96.â€”Posterior Gastro-jejunostomy. Attaching the Jejunmn to the Stomach. The continuous sero-muscular suture to form the posterior half of the outer ring of suture is being inserted. The right-hand end is left long for subsequent use. coats on both sides, firmly unites them and by its pressure stops any bleed- ing (see Fig. 97). As this suture, if carried round the entire circum- ference of the anastomosis, would leave portions of the mucous membrane projecting on the anterior aspect of the union, it becomes necessary to make some little alteration in the method of its insertion in the anterior half. The posterior half of the stitch is generally begun at the extreme left end of the posterior aspect of the anastomosis, and is carried, as a simple running suture, as far as the right end of the posterior aspect ; then, in order to turn the corner, the stitch is changed to the pillow-maker's stitch, the details of which are shown in Fig. 98 and which has the effect of invaginating the mucous surfaces as it is pulled tight. This is an excellent stitch and very simple, and should be practised by, and be quite familiar to, all who have to perform intestinal suture. When the stitch

CHAPTER XVIII. 295 CONGENITAL HYPERTROPHIC STENOSIS OF THE PYLORUS : NON-OBSTRUCTIVE DILATATION OF THE STOMACH. CONGENITAL HYPERTROPHIC STENOSIS OF THE PYLORUS. This condition has come into considerable prominence during tlie last few years. It is an affection of early infancy characterised by obstruction to the passage of the contents of the stomach into the duodenum owing to an increase in the thickness of the pylorus. The exact cause of this increase is not known, but the result is that the pyloric ring shows itself as a dense whitish cylinder closely resembling a small decalcified bone bobbin and sometimes measuring an inch or even more in diameter. It feels like cartilage, and although it relaxes somewhat from time to time, especially under anaesthesia, it is always abnormally hard and unduly contracted. The effect of this is to give rise to narrowing of the pyloric outlet, and as a result the stomach becomes dilated and its walls considerably hyper- trophied. The enlarged pylorus forms a tumour that can be felt through the abdominal walls, and the hypertrophied and dilated stomach gives rise to a visible peristaltic wave in its efforts to empty itself. The symptoms of this affection may set in immediately after birth or their onset may be delayed for a fortnight or longer. Occasionally the onset of symptoms coincides with the substitution of artificial food for breast-feeding, but in many cases they arise during suckling. The child begins to vomit, becomes peevish and pinched in appearance, and loses weight rapidly. The vomiting usually occurs only twice or three times a day and is forcible, and the vomit consists of the contents of a dilated stomach. Peristaltic waves are seen travelling across the stomach wall from left to right, especially after food, and care- ful deep palpation may detect the enlarged pylorus sometimes high up beneath the liver, but more usually at or below the level of the umbilicus

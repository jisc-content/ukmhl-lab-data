299 NON-OBSTRUCTIVE DILATATION both with gas and fluid, and frequent vomiting soon sets in accompanied by prostration, pain, hiccough, and constipation. If the stomach is the only organ which is distended, its outhne is quite evident as a large, somewhat pear-shaped swelling at the upper and left side of the abdomen. Even if there is a good deal of abdominal distension, the firmer outline of the stomach can usually be detected and percussion will also help in the diagnosis. There is also frequent vomiting without relief of the condition. The pathology of acute dilatation is by no means clear. It seems to be a paralytic condition of the stomach rather than a contraction of the pylorus or intestine, as has been suggested. The cases which we have seen have usually been associated with some other abdominal trouble, especially acute appendicitis, and it seems to be some toxaemic or reflex effect. TREATMENT.â€”The best way is to empty the stomach by means of a tube and then wash it out. We have had a case in which the stomach had so completely lost its contractile power that the only way of emptying it was by putting the patient in the Trendelenburg position. The stomach tube should be used regularly three or four times a day until the contractile power lias been regained. Strychnine and antispas- modics may be of value. Chronic dilatation of the stomach without constriction of the pylorus is most frequently a part of Glenard's disease, and the stomach is usually abnormally low down. The treatment is lavage of the stomach combined wdth the measures recommended for enteroptosis. Operations such as gastro-jejunostomy and gastro-plication do not seem to benefit the patient.

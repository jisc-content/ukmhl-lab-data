563 PRURITUS ANI junction is reached. The little skin bridges between the ends of the incisions in front and behind are undermined with a tenotome, and the skin of the buttock on each side is undermined for a short distance out- wards from each incision. The incisions are now brought together with silkworm-gut, and a firm pad of dressing is fixed on by means of a T-bandage. The effect of the operation is to sever the cutaneous nerve endings from their nerves and thus produce temporary ansesthesia ; sensation, however, is eventually regained. The wound should not be sutured too closely in case sepsis should occur ; if it does, most of the sutures should be removed and warm boric fomentations substituted. The bowels should not be opened until the fourth day.

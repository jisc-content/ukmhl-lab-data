AFFECTIONS OF THE RECTUM AND ANUS 6o8 is next divided downwards and the rectum proper is then isolated, together with the glands and fat in the hollow of the sacrum. If there is sufficient healthy bowel below the tumour, the incision already made around the muco-cutaneous mar- gin is deepened as in Whitehead's operation (see p. 569), and the mucous membrane is dissected off the sphincters, and then, after plugging the rectum above the proposed level of division, is divided at the level of the upper border of the internal sphincter. The mucous membrane is now seized in catch-forceps and pulled down through the anus, and the upper end of the rectum and the pelvic colon is brought through the sphincters and stitched to the skin around the anus, about the proposed level at which the bowel is to be divided above the growth; if necessary, the skin at the anal margin can be loosened and pulled in, so as to reach the mucous membrane. In stitching up the incision in the vaginal wall at the end of the operation, it is well to carry the stitches through the muscular coat of the bowel also ; they thus hold the bowel down in posi- tion and prevent dragging on the anal sutures. The perineum is then repaired (see Fig. 208). 4. Excision partly or entirely through the abdomen,—This opera- tion, which is being practised with increasing frequency, con- sists in opening the abdomen, detaching the rectum and the glands above the tumour as far as possible from above, dividing and ligaturing the vessels, dividing the bowel and sewing up the lower end temporarily, attaching the upper end to the abdominal wound so as to form an artificial anus, and, finally, dissecting out and removing Fig. 208.—Vaginal Excision of the Rectum. The incision sutured. A tube is tied into the divided end of the bowel.

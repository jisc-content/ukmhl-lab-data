CHAPTER XXXVI. INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS OF THE RECTUM. ACUTE PROCTITIS. Subacute or chronic inflammation of the rectum is comparatively common. The acute form is rarer and may occur in connection with dysentery, with various operations about the anus or the lower end of the rectum, with injuries from foreign bodies, with ulcerative coUtis, or as the result of bacterial infection—most frequently by the gonococcus, either as an extension from the vagina or as the result of pederasty. The inflammation of the mucous membrane is accompanied by much congestion, and in bad cases results in ulceration or sloughing of the mucous surface. The tendency, however, is towards cure, provided that the exciting cause is removed and proper rest given to the bowel. In very acute cases the infection may extend through the wall of the rectum giving rise to peri-proctitis (see Chap. XXXVIII.). Should the condition persist, it passes into a chronic proctitis, either of the proliferative or ulcerative variety {vide infra). The symptoms are distressing heat and weight about the rectum, discomfort in the pelvis, and often considerable pain, accompanied by tenesmus and the frequent passage of small quantities of faecal material mixed with mucus and often tinged with blood. If the disease is very acute and goes on to sloughing, there may be suppuration from the mucous surface. Irritability of the bladder is also a frequent symptom, whilst the anus is generally painful and may be red. Digital or proctoscopic examination is painful, and a general ansesthetic is advisable for the purpose of making a thorough examination. TREATMENT.—The first essential is to remove any cause—such as a foreign body or worms. The patient should be confined to bed, and the bowels should be kept open—at first by salines and afterwards by gentle laxatives. For severe pain, suppositories containing two grains of opium with half a grain of extract of belladonna, or an enema of an 535

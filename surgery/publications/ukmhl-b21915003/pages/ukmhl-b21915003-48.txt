32 symptomatic fever/ Thus Garangeot in his surgery gives a history in which a sword traversed the belly, entering below the xiphoid cartilage, and presenting be- i tween the third and fourth false ribs of the right side. So slight were the symptoms, that on the tenth day the patient resumed his ordinary occupation. I must observe that there is no authority for the inference of Wiseman and Garangeot. If the abdo- men be at all times in a state of fulness, as has been established, it is impossible that an instrument should perforate it without in- jury to its contents ; such an occurrence has never been proved to be possible, much less to have taken place; while on the other hand, it has been clearly and repeatedly demonstrated, that very slight and appa- rently inadequate symptoms ensue upon as- certained wounds of intestines, under cir- cumstances in which their reparation is easily effected. * Morgagni, Lett. 54, Art. 7.

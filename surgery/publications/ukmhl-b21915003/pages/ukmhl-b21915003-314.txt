It follows upon this representation, that the distinction taken from the extent of the protruded part is de- lusive, and that the ligature is at least su- perfluous. The natural relation between the parts of the tube included in the stricture can only be determined by the extent of the part protruded, since these must form its ex- tremities. But if the jejunum and sigmoid flexure of the colon were included in the stricture, they would be securely retained there without artificial aid. This adhesion is the result of inflammation of one or both surfaces, by whatever cause induced. I have no conception of the possibility of adhesion without inflammation. In reducible hernia the sac has a wide mouth ; and no stricture having been formed, no inflammation has taken place. But upon tracing the history of an irreducible rupture, we shall find that

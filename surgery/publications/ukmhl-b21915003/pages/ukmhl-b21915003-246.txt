230 I relating them has been to shew, first, that there is a state of the intestine want- ing the criteria of gangrene, in which the operation does not arrest the symptoms caused by obstruction. Secondly, that such intestine when examined after death re- maining unaltered, no signs of disorganiza- tion being present, there is much reason to suppose that it has been palsied by the duration and severity of the stricture*. Thirdly, that the return of a bowel un- equal to the resumption of its muscular or peristaltic action, counteracts the inten- tion and defeats the success of the ope- \ ration, for though the strangulation is re-1 moved, the only dangerous consequence of it, the obstruction, continues. Â» * If we consider the paralysing effect of acute inflammation attacking a muscle; the inability of the oesophagus, the urinary bladder and other parts to obey their natural stimuli when so affected; we shall have no difficulty in accounting for the torpor of a bowel recently released from strangulation. Not only is the tissue of the organ gorged with a preternatural quantity of blood, but of blood unfitted by its stagnation for the maintenance of the vital functions. Vide Bichat. Anat.

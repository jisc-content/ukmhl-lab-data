179 jections have been taken to the glover's suture by Le Dr an, Garangeot, Bertrandi, Desault, Sabatier, and Mr. Benj. Bell: on the other hand, it has received the approbation of Dionis, Wiseman, Heister, Sharp, Gooch, Latta, and others. The objections are trivial and speculative ; and none of the deviations to which they have given birth, appear to me entitled to a preference. I have thrown them into a note, that the reader may form his own opinion *. * Garangeot condemns the glover’s suture, alledging that it is difficult to disengage it without injuring the intestine ; and he substitutes in its stead a suture, the turns of which have a spiral obliquity, without an angle to impede its removal when it is to be drawn away. Le Dran likewise objects to the glover’s suture, and is the author of what has been termed the loop suture—which con- sists of as many detached threads as the length of the wound may require, passed through the lips of the wound at an interval of nearly a quarter of an inch from each other. The threads being passed and the needles removed, all those on one side of the cut are to be tied together with a knot at their ends, and those on the opposite side must afterwards be secured in the same manner. They are now to be joined and twisted two or three times, so as to form a cord. By this means the divided parts of the intestine are puckered together, so that the stitches, which were before distant, are now brought close to each other. The intestine is then to be replaced, and the threads secured to the bandage ; and after remaining till the wound in the gut is s N 2

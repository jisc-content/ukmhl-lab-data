9 diaphragm. If the chest or belly of a living animal could be inspected while the boun- daries remained entire, it would be found that the contents were in actual contact1 wifh the parietes : that an intestine, for ex- ample, was on every side in contact with surrounding intestines, or with the perito- neum lining the muscles. Instead therefore of floating loosely, as has been represented, it is supported by the equable pressure of the parts in its vicinity, and all wounds penetrat- ing the abdomen would of necessity pene- trate the contiguous intestines, did they not oppose a resistance so slight as to be more readily displaced than wounded.* The distension following a full meal, the impediment to respiration from tight banda- ges of the abdomen, and the production of hernia from forcible inspirations are proofs of an universal pressure. * This mobility, it may be observed, diminishes the risk of injury to which parts are exposed, possessing only a mus- sliiar covering. - a * 1 1 â–  *'

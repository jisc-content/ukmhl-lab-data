PREFACE. Vll “ Without principles,” ‘ says an able French writer,’ “ practice is a mere rou- tine ; the good or ill results of which the cause is not discerned, are equally lost to the progress of Art. The success which we cannot explain often leads us into error, and serves only to perpetuate, under the name of experience, a blind conduct, of which we know neither the good nor the evil It remains only that I offer my public and particular acknowledgments to my friends Dr. De Lys of Birmingham, and Mr. Hodgson of London, for much able and kind assistance in the prosecution of this Inquiry. To the latter I am also indebted for the drawings which accompany the volume. * M. Goursaud in the Memoirs of the Academy of Sur- gery.

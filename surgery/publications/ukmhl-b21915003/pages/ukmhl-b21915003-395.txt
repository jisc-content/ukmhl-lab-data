APPENDIX. Case III. I regret that the following valuable communication which was obligingly sent to me by Mr. Brodie, of St. George’s Hospital, did not reach me until I had proceeded too far to introduce it in its proper place. “Michael Orwell, who had been subject to the occas- sional protrusion of an inguinal hernia, from the time of his being an infant, was admitted into St. George's Hospital about 5 P. M. on the 7th of October, 1806, with the hernia in a state of strangulation. He said the strangulation had existed for 16 hours? and that he had had no evacuation for 30 hours before his admission. At this time the hernia was of the size of a small orange, and both the tumour and the abdomen were very painful when pressed; his pulse was hard and dry. He had occasional hiccup, and vomited fre- quently. Eighteen ounces of blood were taken from his arm ; he was put into the warm bath, a clyster of infusion of tobacco was administered, and attempts were made to reduce the hernia, but without suc- cess. At eleven in the evening, Mr. Gunning, whose patient he was, performed the operation. The hernia Was found to be congenital, and about six inches of the small intestine, of a red colour, were contained in the tunica vaginalis. The stricture was situated >» . '. above the abdominal ring; and the reduction T ras 1 - . effected with considerable difficulty. After the ope- ration, a glyster of water was injected. During the night, he had less pain than before the the operation ; but the hiccupping and vomiting con- tinued.

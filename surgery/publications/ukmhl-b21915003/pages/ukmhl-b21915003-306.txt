290 Sharp advises the cutting away of the gan- grene, whether of the intestine or omentum. He says that the surgeons of his day have surmounted the prejudices of their ancestors; for seeing small gangrenes do well, and some instances of recovery where the slough of the integuments had permitted the evacua- tion of the faeces, they concluded that if the mortified part was cut off, the strangulation removed, and a free issue given to the feces, the patient might probably survive who otherwise would perish. He advises the union of the living intestine by the in** terrupted suture, or if this cannot be done from their adhering or lying unaptly, it is to be confined by a stitch to the borders of the wound; from which time the extremity of the upper portion becomes an artificial anus *4 Richter, whose treatise on Hernia dis- covers a profundity of research, and an extent of personal observation in his time * Critical Enquiry, pa. 37-8*

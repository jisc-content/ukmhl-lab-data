In both cases a firm circle of adhesion is formed at the peritoneal open- ing. To discriminate between the effects of the obstruction, and of the local in- jury, I combined these experiments in a third ; the result of which appears to me i decisive of the position, that the obstruction, and not the local injury, is the cause of the peritoneal inflammation.

A loop of intestine, four inches long, was drawn through a small incision of the pa- rietes; the anterior half was strangulated by a tight ligature on the outside of the in- tegument, which was then sewed close around it; and the remaining two inches were left to inflame in the space between the / â€¢ ) muscles and the skin.

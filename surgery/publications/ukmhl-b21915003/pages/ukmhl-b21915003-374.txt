358 coat. There was no fissure or mark of dis- continuity upon the mucous surface, except a small ulcerated aperture which communi- cated with the wound. It was thus evident that the gut had been retracted into the ab- domen, so as to escape the stricture. The following are practical deductions from these experiments. \ 1. The peritoneal surface is essential to the restoration of an intestine of which a part has been disorganized by stricture; for if the stricture is external to the peri- toneum, the parts are insusceptible of union, and the artificial anus is perma- nent (Experiments U. W.) : but if the stricture is formed by or within the sac of the peritoneum, the tube is susceptible of restoration (Experiment Y.) If the peri- toneum, agreeably to the opinion of the ancients, was ruptured instead of being di- lated to form a sac inclosing the hernia, it is to be questioned whether the process of union could take place so readily as it has been often known to do.

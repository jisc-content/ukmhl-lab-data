46 dency to effusion in the latter class of in- juries. I should explain it by the dif- ference in the nature of the injury which the bowel sustains, when perforated by a sword or bullet as in the one case, or burst or ulcerated as in the other. A rupture by concussion could only take place under a distended state of the bowel, a condition most favourable to effusion, and from the texture of the part, a rupture so produced would seldom be of limited extent. The process of ulceration by which an aper- ture is formed, commences in the internal coat of the bowel, which has always in- curred a more extensive laesion than the peritoneal covering. The puncture or cut is merely a solution of continuity in a point or line, the ulcerated wound is an actual loss of substance. The consequence of this difference is, that while the. former if small is glued up by the effusion from the Â«ut vessels, or if large is nearly obliterated by the full eversion of the villous coat, the latter is a permanent orifice.

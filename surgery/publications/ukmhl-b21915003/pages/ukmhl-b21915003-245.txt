I t ‘129 Case V. I femoral hernia in a middle aged man, had been strangulated for forty hours. Although the intestine had not given way, the operator expressed his doubts of its re- covery ; but seeing no alternative, it was returned. The symptoms went on, and the patient died on the third day. Upon in- spection, the ordinary appearances of inflam- t 1 > mation were presented ; the strangulated part remained precisely in the same state as at the time of the operation. ♦ I shall not detail more cases of this descrip- tion, because those who see the practice r of large, hospitals must know that they are by no means rare.* My object in * I may observe that this is just that description of case* which, notwithstanding its frequency, has nearly escaped record, and where it has been recorded, the result has been otherwise interpreted. Desault referred it to the prejudicia effect of the taxis*; others to the supervention of gangrene. * See a case in point. CEuvres Chirurg. Tom. II. p. 334. The hernia had been strangulated only fifteen hours before the operation ; the intestine was discoloured, (contused) not mortified j the symptoms con tinued, and the patient died on the third day.

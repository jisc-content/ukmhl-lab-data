133 cerated apertures, because in these the com- bination of the causes of impediment is / destroyed. 3. The uniform , contiguity of the peri- toneal surfaces, and the ready disposition of these surfaces to assume the adhesive in- flammation, are the means provided by Nature for the reparation of intestinal wounds and injuries. 4. By these means punctured and small incised wounds, transverse or longitudinal, and apertures from excision of substance, readily admit of spontaneous cure. 5. It is even possible under certain con- ditions that after a wound by which the intestine is half divided, the tube may be imperfectly restored upon the same prin- ciple ; but wounds amounting to a direct division of the canal are irreparable, and therefore invariably fatal. 6f Where the division is indirect, as by the operation of a stricture, natural or arti- \ ficial, the injury admits of speedy and per- fect recovery.

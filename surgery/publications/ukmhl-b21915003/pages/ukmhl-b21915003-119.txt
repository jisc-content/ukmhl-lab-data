103 unite the contiguous surfaces, the effused aliment will be prevented from passing into the abdomen, and the animal may thus escape immediate destruction. But it is equally impossible in this as in the case of complete division for union to take place, except by the medium of surrounding parts; and whether in such a deviation from the original structure of the canal, the motion of the intestines forming the diverticulum would suffice for the propulsion of the ali- ment, and the deficiency of the secreting surface would permit of its progress, I have no evidence which will enable me to de- termine. 7. It is the retraction ensuing upon direct division which renders this injury irrepara- ble. For if the division be performed in such away as to prevent retraction, the canal will be restored in so short a time as but slightly to interrupt the digestive function. The result of experiment O confirms this inference. A ligature fastened around the

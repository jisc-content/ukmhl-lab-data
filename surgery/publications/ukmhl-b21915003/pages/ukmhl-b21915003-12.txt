VI PREFACE. are effusions into the brain, thorax, or abdomen. It is obvious that minute attention to the operations of the restorative principle will afford a clue to the rational treatment of those injuries in which it is displayed. Thus we have learned to unite wounds by adhesion, instead of leaving them to be filled slowly up with new matter—to rupture the capsule of the opake crystalline, in order to bring about its solution in the aqueous % humour—to tie the diseased artery, more effectually to cut off the supply, and force the collateral circulation; and in the work which I now lay before the profession, my object has been in like manner to take a lesson from Nature. I have endeavoured to ascertain the plan and limit of her ope- i rations in an important class of injuries, to compare the facts of history with the results of experiment, and from these sources to derive a rational and consistent theory of treatment.

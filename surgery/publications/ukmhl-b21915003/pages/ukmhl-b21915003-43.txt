27 air had entered, so that a beginning emvph- sema was brought on. This air had got out of the colon which was wounded into the cavity of the belly, and had distended it; nor had air alone come forth but the ex- crements also, so that although a fluid was extravasated in the belly to the quantity of two pounds, the greater part of it was ex- crementitious, and very little blood, no con- siderable vessel having been injured.'’ * Cases of faecal effusion accompanying ex- travasation of blood, are recorded by Baltazar Timaeus,f Hoyerus,* Ravaton || and others. Saltzman has a case in which three or four lumbrici had escaped from a wound of the ileon. I have often met with this cir- cumstance in dogs whose intestines generally contain worms, but it is evidently a peculiar case to which no reasoning on the effusion of inanimate matter can apply. * Lett. 54, Art. 37.

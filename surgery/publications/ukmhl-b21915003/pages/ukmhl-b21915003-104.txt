In the lacerated wound, the eversion was so slight as to be scarcely perceptible. As the peristaltic action became feeble, these ap- pearances became indistinct, and when it had ceased altogether, a fresh wound un- derwent only a tritiing enlargement from the elasticity of the peritoneal coat. Having witnessed the facility with which considerable laesions of the intestinal tube were repaired, I was solicitous to ascertain more fully the powers of nature in the process of spontaneous reparation; to de- termine under how great a degree of injury it would commence, and if it were effected, the mode of its accomplishment.

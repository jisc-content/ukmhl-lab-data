314 and the animal died of a faecal effusion. Louis attributes Moebiusâ€™s failure to his having omitted to cut transversely the mesentery attached to the superior extremity, a method of proceeding which, he says, makes the operation easy and secure. It does not ap- pear however that Louis succeeded in re- peating upon the dog the operation of Ramh- dor, and the representation of Moebius has been since confirmed. Shipton, an english student of surgery, in the early part of the last century made the following experiment. Having cut away a portion equal to two fingers breadth of the ileon of a dog, he connected the extremities by an uninter- rupted suture, and closed the external wound. The cicatrix being completed, and the parts examined at the end of three weeks, the result proved highly curious. The sewed intestine lay at a considerable distance from the wound, firmly attached to the peritoneum, but the suture had yielded so as to allow the cut ends of the gut to recede, which were

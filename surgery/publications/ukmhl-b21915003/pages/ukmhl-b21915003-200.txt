( 1 §4* not better be omitted altogether, since neither the wound in the bowel nor in the tegument can heal until the ligature is withdrawn, whereas if the ligature be cut at the knot, the union is completed before it is discharged, ■ I * ,, notwithstanding it is discharged sooner. The ascertained fact of a peritoneal union in all cases, the consequent and natural dis- charge of the ligature by the bowel, and the § demonstrable futility of confining the in- testine to the parietal wound, are the grounds ' \ * ' upon which I argue the impropriety of the practice hitherto adopted. Wherever the suture is decided upon, it should be com- plete, the intestine should be returned fairly into the abdomen, and the wound of the parietes be treated as if it had not extended beyond them. Wherever on the other hand, the process of healing is to be left to Nature, no advantage can result from a partial suture or a loop of the mesentery. Both theory and experience give some reason to fear the . * * contrary.

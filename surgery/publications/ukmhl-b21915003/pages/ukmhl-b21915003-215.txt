This angle, formed by the two • . « portions of the gut at the point of division, is not a rare disposition, as Mor&nd re- marks. It opposes a resistance to the matter proportioned to its acuteness, so that if it approaches to parallelism, all access to the inferior portion of the canal will be prevented, while the matters will escape in part this way, if it approaches to the perpendicular. Now when a large por- tion of the canal has been destroyed, or when the tube has been cut across, it assumes ' ✓ the former disposition. The second is for the most part observed when the section has included only a part of its paries. We con ceive that the difficulty of the cure is in the direct ratio of the one and the inverse of the

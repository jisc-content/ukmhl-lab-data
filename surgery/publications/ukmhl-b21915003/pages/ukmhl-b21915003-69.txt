53 I EXPERIMENT C. To ascertain the mode of reparation adopt- ed by nature in penetrating wounds, unat- tended by exposure of the gut, the abdomen of a dog was pierced by a paracentesis tro- car, directed obliquely from the flank to- ward the stomach. He fainted, but in a short time recovered, ate, drank, and passed his excrement as usual. On the fourth day he was killed. The wound of the peritoneum was marked by a slight ecchymosis. The duodenum had been fairly transfixed. Each orifice was concealed by a portion of the omentum, which lies on the side of this bowel. It / had contracted a firm and well defined ad- hesion to the margin of the wound, denoted by a circular line of a florid red colour. Not a trace of inflammation was elsewhere visi- ble. The stomach and bowels were loaded and in full action.

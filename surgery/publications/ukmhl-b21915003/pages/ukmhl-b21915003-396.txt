580 APPENDIX. On the following morning, October 8th, he had had no evacuation of faeces. The sickness continued. The pulse intermitted at irregular periods. Eight ounces of blood were taken from his arm. A purging draught was given him ; but it did not stay on his stomach. During the day, he complained of pain in the ab- domen ; the vomiting continued ; the intermission of the pulse was more frequent; the tongue became dry, and covered with a brown fur. Purgative glysters were administered, and he took pills composed of calomel and extract of colocynth ; but no evacuation of faeces took place. During the following night, all these symptoms increased ; the matter which he vomited had a fecu- lent smell. He had some evacuations from the bowels, but they proved tb be only the glysters which had been previously thrown up. October 9th. His pulse was weak and fluttering ; the vomiting continued ; he fell into a state of stupor, and died at five o’clock in the afternoon. Inspection.—On opening the abdomen, the peri- toneum generally bore marks of inflammation. The impression of the stricture still remained on the smalt intestine. That portion of the gut which had formed the hernia, was of a dark colour, but not mortified. Coagulated lymph had been effused, which glued this and the neighbouring portions of intestine to each other, in such a way, that the canal made se- veral very acute turns upon itself. The upper por- tion of the small intestine was much distended by its contents, which did not appear to have passed beyond the convolutions thus glued together.”

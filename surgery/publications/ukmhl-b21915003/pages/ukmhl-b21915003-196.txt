180 It is not the kind of suture employed, but the application of it conformably to the prin- ciples of its operation illustrated in the pro a upposed to be healed, they are then to be untwisted 5 and all the ends of one side being cut close to the external wound, they must now be drawn slowly and separately away; If there i® considerable loss of substance, Le Dran advises to coniine the gut to the wound by two or three threads, to prevent the escape of matters into the abdomen t Bertrandi recommends the continued suture passing through and not over the lips of the wound, in which he is followed by Desault and Sabatier. The reason for this preference is an opinion that the edges of the intestinal wound will be prevented from adhering to the integument by the intervention of the thread. “ Even this method of treatment,” says Mr. Bell, speaking of the glover’s suture, '‘mint tend to lessen the diameter of the gut, a diffi- culty which may be avoided, and the operation be performed with the same degree of security by entering the needle always from the inside of the gut, and pushing it outward. The operation should commence near to one end of the wound ; the needle being pushed through one side of the gut, the ligature should be drawn for- ward, and retained by a knot formed on the end remaining on Tie inside. The needle must now be carried straight across and entered in a similar manner ; but the following and every succeeding stitch will not be opposite to each other. When the operation is rightly performed, the needle will be carried from one side of the wound, in a diagonal line, to the other, and will enter the gut at the distance of two tenths of an inch from the point from which it came on the opposite side. In this manner the sides of the wound may be drawn closely and exactly to- • gether without lessening the diameter of the gut in any degree ; and the end of the ligature may at last be secured and cut off close to the other extremity of the wound, if the gut is to be put freely into the abdomen; or it may be left of a sufficient length

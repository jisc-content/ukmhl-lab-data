He was freely bled without any mitigation of symptoms. His strength de- clined, and he expired in forty-eight hours after receiving the injury. On carefully in- specting the abdomen, a considerable quan- tity of fluid appeared, in which could be plainly perceived particles of castor oil, which he had swallowed some hours be- fore his decease. A circular aperture with a ragged margin, of a size equal to the tube of a writing pen, was discovered in the ileon. The peritoneal surface was disco- loured and coagulated lymph shed among the intestines. For another example of this fact, I refer the reader to an apposite case contributed by Mr. Norris to Mr. Cooperâ€™s work on Hernia.* * Vide Case of Serjeson, pref. to Part II.

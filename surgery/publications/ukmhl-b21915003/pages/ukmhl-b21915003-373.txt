557 \ the parts being on all sides surrounded bv a peritoneal surface. This event encouraged an idea that the knuckle would be disposed of in the same way; but the irritation oc- casioned by so large a portion of dead, and consequently extraneous matter, caused a dif- fused inflammation and death. As the effort of Nature to repair the local mischief was thus strikingly demonstrated, it appeared more than probable, that if the reduction of the strangulated piece could be avoided, and on the other hand the artificial anus be prevented, the canal would be restored. In another experiment it was contrived, though with difficulty, that the peritoneal aperture should form the stricture ; and the integu- ment was drawn over the strangulated piece. The animal recovered ; but no discharge was observed at the wound, which in a fortnight was very nearly healed. Upon inspection, the gut was found fixed to the wound, greatly contracted by irregular ad- hesions, and the puckering of the mucous

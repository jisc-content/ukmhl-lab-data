S56 mind as most probable, is that which renders its introduction appropriate in this place, viz. the death of the intestine included in the hernia, and its separation into the canal. This opinion however is insusceptible of proof; and the reader, after duly weighing the circumstances, must decide for himself. In the commencement of the experi- ments now related, for the sake of a closer analogy with hernia, I attempted to produce a natural stricture which should occasion a sphacelus of the gut. Having repeatedly failed of this object, I employed the artificial stricture of a ligature. When this was ap- plied and retained at the wound, the whole separated externally to the peritoneum, and left the ends of the gut uncovered, and forming an incurable artificial anus. Since I could not obtain the fixed natural stric- ture, I again subjected the bowel to the ligature, and returned into the abdomen a portion of the strangulated fold, sufficient to retain the ligature. This injury, con- siderable as it was, was speedily repaired.

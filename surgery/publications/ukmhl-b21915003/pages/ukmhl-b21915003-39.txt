2 3 effusion,* and we are therefore at liberty to infer that no such event had taken place, there is so little evidence that the attention of the anatomist was directed to this point, otherwise difficult to be ascertained, and the description of appearances is so * Vid.

Until the fifth day the symptoms afforded no evidence that the intestine had been touched. At this time the pulse sunk, the belly swelled, the patient was distressed with nausea and vomiting, and died on the eighth day. The ileon was pierced in three places, but the wounds were so small, that they would not have been perceived but for the effusion of the faecal matters —“Je trouvai 1’intcstin ileon perce en troisendroits, mais de playes si petitcs qu’st peine je le pus appercevoir sans quiT y eut aucune matiere epanchee dans le has ventre.”—Traite complet de Chirurgie. vol. 2. p. 428. It is rather singular, that the same M. La Motte should Tiave met with two cases in which the ileon was wounded in several places and extensively, in which no effusion had ensued, and with a third case in which effu- sion had taken place from openings so small as to be scarcely discoverable. It is singular that a patient should survive an effusion for a period of eight days, and more so, that for the first five days he should suffer no inconvenience from it. But

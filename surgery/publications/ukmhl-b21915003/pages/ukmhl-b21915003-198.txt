The pro- cess of union in a bowel thus situated, is independent and proper to itself, as is shewn by the experiments which I have related. The slight adhesion of the adjacent surfaces is contingent and not accessary to the * Sabatier expresses, in stronger terms, precisely the same opinion, in commenting upon Le Dran’s suture, who says that the knitting of the lips of the wound together, prevents their sepa- ration, and causes them to adhere.—-Med.

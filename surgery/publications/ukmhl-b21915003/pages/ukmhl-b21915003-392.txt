376 APPENDIX. oâ€™clock one evening in February, he sent me an urgent request to visit him immediately. I did so, and found him in a state of extreme suffering. He had been dining in company, and was seized on a sudden with an excruciating pain in the belly, which lie described as unlike what be had ever felt. The principal seat of his pain, which never remitted for an instant, was (he region of the navel ; but it sometimes spread from this point, as from a centre, over his whole body, even to his limbs, and especially affected his neck and shoulders. His abdomen was already distended and hard. I directed a warm fomentation to be applied to the abdomen ; he experienced no relief, and I bled him freely. His respiration was hurried, but his pulse little if at all affected. Flatus rose in quantity from his stomach, but he did not vomit. After some time, finding his torture to increase, I desired a con- sultation, and my friend Dr. Birkbeck saw him. Some calomel and opium were immediately given and quickly followed by a saline cathartic, which was di- rected to be frequently repeated. At midnight the medicine had not operated; he could not bear his belly to be touched ; often he roared out with pain, and wished to be relieved by death. I took another basin of blood from his arm. A glyster was directed to be injected, and a warm bath to be prepared as soon as possible. He often called for a spoonful of gruel, which returned without the effort of retching, after he had swallowed it. 3 a. m. His pain was not miti- gated ; his pulse was small, and intermitted very irregularly. He was perfectly sensible, but his strength was almost exhausted. His extremities became cold ; and he died in the bath at 6 a. m. about thirteen hours after the first attack of pain.

25 6‘ Case I. . An aged patient of La Salp£triere, had a reducible rupture, and as he wore no truss, was frequently teased with cholicky pains, which ceased upon restoring the gut to its place. In January, 1750, this mode of re- lief failed, and he accordingly purged him- self with jalap. Though the medicine operated well, the rupture inflamed and went on to gangrene. When Louis, who reports the case, was called to him, the gan- grene had extended a palm in breadth, and • , from five or six holes in the dead skin the excrement was discharged. He had neither fever, nor nausea, nor vomiting. The proper i dressings were attentively applied, and the patient was nourished by good broths, and took half a glass of wine morning and evening. Injections were likewise given twice daily. As the wound filled, the feculent discharge fell off in quantity.

87 across, eversion of both orifices took place, and they were instantly separated to a con- siderable distance. The contents, in part ejected at the moment of eversion, were restrained and in a slight degree absorbed by a succeeding contraction ot the orifices, which was followed by a dilatation and simul- • • ’ taneous propulsion of the aliment; again the orifice was closely contracted and the mat- ters arrested ; and thus was the tube alternately opened and closed by the muscular motions of the bowel. At the moment of dilatation the contents were thrown out with a spas- modic jerk, and the everted lip gained in breadth as the motions increased in number. The edges of the longitudinal wound were less fully everted, hut the divided fibres, drawing them in opposite directions, made the aperture approach to a circular figure, so that the contents issued very freely. There was little alternate contraction and dilatation f of this aperture. The punctured wound everted irregularly, it had no even marginal

EXPLANATION OF THE PLATES. PLATE I. Fig. 1 shews the size and direction of the wound in the duodenum which was unaccompanied by effusion of the contents of the bowel. (See page 21.) a—a portion of the pancreas. b—the jejunum. c—a bougie in the position of the bayonet. This figure is from a drawing by Mr. Thompson. Fig. 2 shews the contraction of the muscular and the per- manent eversion of the mucous coat, which follows an incised wound of the bowel. (See page 85.) \ Fig. 3 shews the aperture of an intestine by a process of ulceration, in which the mucous coat being more exten- sively destroyed than the peritoneal, no eversion can take place. A shred of peritoneum not destroyed by ulceration is seen crossing the aperture, and a pellicle of lymph has been partially deposited around its thin, jagged margin. (See the conclusions at page 46.)

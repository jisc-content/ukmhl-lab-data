Now by whatever difference in the circumstances of the injuries, or the constitutions of the patients, these opposite results might be ex- plained ; the inflammation of the peritoneal surface in the one class, and its absence in the other, is, I doubt not, the real cause of the distinction. Every wound is followed by in- flammation, varied in strength and degree by the influence of occasional causes. The in- flammation set up by an incised wound of the peritoneum, is the same as follows this wound in the integument of the body, ter- minating in the union by adhesion. The ca« . pillaries opening upon the cut edges pour forth a glutinous cement, which becomes the medium of inosculation between them. This purely local process so rapidly and with so lit- tle effort obliterates the injury, that it excites

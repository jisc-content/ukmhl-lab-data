131 It has been found sufficient tor the pur- pose of union, to include only the peri- toneal covering of the intestine in the suture, a proof that provided the severed extremi- ties are fairly brought into contact, the event, under any circumstances, will be uniform. The adhesion which takes place between the mucous surfaces in a few hours after their connection by suture, is in no instance permanent, being destroyed by the retraction of the divided parts when the ligatures loosen. But if this retraction could be prevented, and the mucous surfaces were retained in contact, it is probable that no organised, and of course no permanent union could take place betwixt them ; for the in- ternal coat of the bowel is, as before ob- served, indisposed to the adhesive inflam- mation*. For this reason it is, that the # I had been led to expect that the interstice of the villous coat would be filled by granulation, and that the substance of the cylinder would in thi3 way be restored at the place of division. But finding the eversion of the villous edges uniform and pejaâ€ž* manent, it seemed doubtful if such a process could be set up, as perfect surfaces were opposed to each other. It is also not iu\ K 2

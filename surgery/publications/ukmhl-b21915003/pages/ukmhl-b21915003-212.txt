It must be evident, however, in all those eases in which the wound of the intestine is not repaired per se, that the case is in fact equivalent to a loss of substance, as the repair of the gut is common with that of the parietes, and the parts will stand or yield together. It is the angular disposition, more or less acute, of the extremities of a gut which has suffered a breach of sub- stance, that gives rise to the formation of an artificial anus. And wherever the healing of an extensive wound in the bowel is effected by its coalescence with the parietal, this angular disposition, greater or less, is inevitable.

In the complicated wound unattended by prolapse, there is no reason to apprehend this result, unless the surgeon, from mistaken no- tions, should dilate it without occasion, or be- yond what the occasion requires; and in the

APPENDIX. 384 ceased wholly for a time; some swelling took place near the wound, suppuration followed, and the faeces again came by the wound ; they continued to do so for some time, and the man at length died. On opening the body, the canal of the intestine on the inner side was perfect, a small hole existed on the op- posite side between the diameter of a sixpence and a shilling, round which strong adhesions had taken place to the parietes. There was no inflammation within the cavity. Much inflammation and some gangrene existed on the upper part of the thigh, which was the cause of the man’s death. I have said that your principles appear plausible to a certain extent, because not knowing your facts, I am at a loss to conceive by what means it is that when a portion of intestine, some inches in length, is suffered to slough away, the canal is preserved, and the external wound closed over it, as you say that the artificial anus seldom follows. The case I have quoted proves the adhesions of which you speak, the danger of severing these by returning the in- testine forcibly, and the freedom from internal in- jury or extravasation which follows your treatment. The deep situation of the opening in the gut, under Poupart’s ligament, which rendered the full and free discharge of the faeces less easy, together with th^ man’s bad habit of body which made this dicharge produce more irritation and inflammation than would probably have occured in a more healthy subject, alone, I conceive, prevented the process of closure being completed.”

52 of the displacement which obtains after its return into the abdomen. These points will be hereafter further illustrated by the results of experiment.* * I am aware that other causes may co-operate in in- ducing this inflammation, and as the extent of the inflammation generally corresponds to that of the prolapse, the exposure to atmospheric air might be considered a sufficient explana- tion of the appearances. But those who attribute such im- portant consequences to this agent, cannot be unacquainted with histories in which the orderly return of half the intesti- nal canal has been made with comparative impunity, after ex- posure for a considerable time to the air and all its impurities ; and the experiments of Dr. New, although they have very sa* tisfactorily decided, that inflammation is induced by the pre- sence of atmospheric air in the belly, also shew that it produces effects widely different from those which ensue upon disturbed position. He injected eight ounces of atmospheric air from a caoutchouc bottle into the belly of a rabbit, which did not af- fect the animal in any degree until the fourth day. t( Tandem autem, quarto post mane, animal male habere visuin est. Non enim cibum eadem quantitate, ut mos erat, appetivit; graviter doluit;humisesesaspe volutavit; etgravem dolorem cepit ex cor- pore ejus, praecipub autem abdomine contrectato. Se pejus pe- jusque habere visum est, usque ad septimum diem; quo occitum est,” &c. u Abdomine patefacto, interna peritonaei facies et ea etiam intestinorum, manifesta inflammationis signa edider- unt. Intestina, hie illic, sibi invicem,aut contiguo peritonceo adhaerebant, et parva quantitas effusi liquoris, sero similis, con- spiciebatur in abdomine.*’* * Disputatio Med, Inaug, Edin. 1795.

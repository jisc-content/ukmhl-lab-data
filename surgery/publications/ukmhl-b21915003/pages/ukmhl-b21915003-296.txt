280 These last are very instructive cases. In \ the former it is evident the powers of life were already sunk below the rallying point. From the two last mentioned cases it ap- pears that notwithstanding the complete spha- celus of a part, peritoneal inflammation had not existed ; and when we consider the duration of strangulation, and the severity of symptoms in the former, and the age of the patient in the latter case, it cannot excite surprise, that they should have sunk under a state of exhaustion from the very imperfect nourish- ment of the system. In all the cases to which I have hitherto adverted, more or less has been done by the surgeon : be has not been simply a spectator. In all, the stricture has been dilated. In some, the dead part excised, and the ex- tremities confined by a ligature of the me- sentery : in some, they have been partially connected by sutures; in others, wholly. In two instances, an opening has been made into the mortified gut after the division of the stricture.

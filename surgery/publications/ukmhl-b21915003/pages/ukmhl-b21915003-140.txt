124 suture, three distinct stitches were inserted. On the sixteenth day the animal was killed, and the union was complete. He then made the experiment without including the foreign substance. On the second day the dog took food and on the fifth the ligatures were drawn away, after which he suffered nothing from the experi- ment. In both of these cases, it should be observed, the intestine rested against the * wound and was confined there, the ligatures depending externally*. To Dr. Thomson, Regius Professor of Military Surgery at Edinburgh, we are in- debted for the following curious and im- portant additions to our knowledge of this subject. After the transverse section of the small intestine of a dog, five uninterrupted stitches were applied at equal intervals, the ligatures cut close, and the external wound sewn. On the tenth day the animal was killed. .Â«. * Cooper on Hernia, Part I. ch. 11.

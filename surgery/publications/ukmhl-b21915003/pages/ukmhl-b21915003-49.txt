/ 33 The ninety-seventh observation of La Motte is a parallel to that of Garangeot. It is the case of a young gentleman whose abdomen was perforated from side to side : the sword entering between the false ribs and the crista a of the ilium, and re-appearing at the corre- sponding point of the opposite flank. La Motte bled him largely, gave him a full vomit, dressed the wounds lightly and sent him into the streets well on the eighth day.* A case similar to Wiseman’s is recorded by Muys. The subject was a young man, twenty years of age. The sword’s point appeared at his back. “ For some days he kept his bed” says Muys, “and complained / of this and that discommodity, but wax- ed better from day to day.”f A full and interesting narrative of this kind is also given by Camerarius,J who at the same time refers to an example of a similar injury, * Traite complet de Chirurgie, t Rational Practice of Chirurgeric, Lond. 1686. 1 Act.

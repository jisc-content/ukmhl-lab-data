EXPLANATION OP THE PLATES. PLATE IV. Fig. 1 shews the effect of a ligature applied to an aperture in the paries intestinalis. (Exper. Q, page 111.) a—'I he muscular peritoneum. b—The injured fold opened posteriorly, to shew the blackened knot of the ligature filling the aperture. Ante- riorly it adheres closely to the peritoneum, below to the adjacent fold of bowel. Fig. 2 shews the pernicious effect of a single ligature ap- plied to the edges of a divided intestine opposite to its connection with the mesentery. (Exper. R, page 116.) The outline on the left of the figure is intended to represent the pancreas, which in the dog is parallel to the duodenum. a—Part of the omentum. b b—Masses of lymph deposited rudely around, which in part concealed the apertures. A worm is seen at one of the orifices. Fig. 3 shews the effect of three stitches passed so near to the edges of a divided gut, as to produce only partial contact. (Exp. S, page 118.)

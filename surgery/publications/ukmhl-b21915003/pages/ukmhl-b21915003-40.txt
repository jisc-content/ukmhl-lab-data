24 generally defective in precision, that I could ■ attach no importance to arguments derived from such a source. the most extraordinary circumstance of the case is, that a wound so small should have admitted of effusion. It is contrary to rational expectation, that from a tube so nearly perfect, and offering no resistance to the progress of its contents, they should escape in a direction perpendicular to the axis of the canal, opposed by the pressure of the surrounding parts. It is also contrary to experience, as has been demonstrated, and will be yet further confirmed in the progress of this inquiry. A sanious fluid, the product of peritoneal inflammation, which there can be no doubt was the real cause of this young man’s death, might easily be mistaken for the effusion which La Motte anticipated. Garangeot has a case in his Memoir* on this subject, as little reconcileable with probability. The wound was inflicted with a hai ger, below the last false rib. It happened two days before Garangeot was consulted, and the man died on the fifth t day. Upon opening the peritoneum, a fluid gushed forth, tinged with the color of the chylous matters. In its most pos- terior convolutions the ileon was pierce d in two places. In this case we are given to understand that the patient survived for five days an effusion of chylous fluid, of which the undulation, as of the water in ascites, was distinctly perceptible on the second day. Garangeot ought to have known that the contents of the ileon do not preserve the chylous aspect, though he may be excused for ignorance of the appearances which the more recent development of the phenomena of inflammation has rendered familiar at the present day. Those who are familiar with the appearances which the abdomen presents under inflammation, will readily recognise an appearance of turbid scrum, re- * Mem, del’Acad. dc Chir. Tom. ii. p. 119.

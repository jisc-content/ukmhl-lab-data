108 manner recovered without the application of any medicine These experiments demonstrate, that wounds in a direction parallel to the canal are spontaneously repaired with more faci- lity than those which are perpendicular to it. This fact is not inconsistent with the conclusions already made. The process of eversion being very limited, the aperture bears a smaller proportion to the cylinder of the bowel, and the action of the di- vided circular resisted by the entire lon- gitudinal fibres, but slightly diminishes the area of the canal. Thus the aperture is more securely defended, and the adhesive process speedily repairs the injury. It should be observed however, that this form of wound is cceteris paribus not less disposed than others to effuse the contents of the in- testine, as I have ascertained by experi- ment. * An Account of some Experiments by Mr. Wm.

341 There was no trace of peritoneal inflamma- tion. This experiment was more than once repeated, but with no better success- The ligature being external to the peritoneum, the ends of the gut were uncovered, and a permanent artiflcial anus was inevitable. From the time at which the artificial anus was established, which was seldom two days from the application of the ligature, the animal's strength, and the little inclination for food which it shewed before the open- ing, gradually failed; and he died ex- hausted, as above described. In not one of these experiments was any symptom of suffering expressed, nor was the faintest mark of inflammatory affection dis- covered within the abdomen. As it appeared that the separation of the slough effected after a stricture thus applied uniformly induced an artificial anus, and that the animal was unable to support the preternatural discharge, it was desirable to ascertain if such an alteration in the circum- stances as would prevent this consequence.

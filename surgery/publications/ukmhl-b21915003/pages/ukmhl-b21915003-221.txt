205 gangrene sooner or later succeeds, and ter minates inflammation. It is the prevailing opinion of our best writers on hernia, that ruptures inflame indis- criminately, that the inflammation spreads upwards into the abdomen, and that thus the disease proves fatal. It is likewise the opi- nion of the French surgeons, who consider the inflammation in many cases, as sup- purative, and spreading along the mesentery.* As I have been led to view the local injury and its effects upon the system in a some- what different light, and it is of the last im- * These gentlemen have formed peculiar notions on this subject. They consider the species and extent of the inflam- mation to be determined by the part strictured. The reasoning employed to account for this phenomenon is as hypothetical as its existence, wherefore J shall content myself with giving the statement. If a part of the cylinder be strictured, or even the whole diameter, provided the stricture but includes it and no more, adhesion to the ring ha3 taken place, and the inflamma- tion and gangrene of the part are purely local; but when the strangulation includes a loop of the intestine, it is loose and unadhering; and inflammation and gangrene extend equally on both sides of the stricture.

56 0 vision *. In the ordinary situation of hernia, the portions of intestine embraced by the stricture occupy a position nearly parallel. Their contiguous sides mutually adhere ; in the remainder of their circumference, they ' adhere to the peritoneum, lining or forming the stricture. rihe existing adhesion of the contiguous sides, strengthened by the ad- hesion of the parts in contact, insures a par- tial continuity upon the separation of the sphacelated part. The line of separation is ihe line of stricture. It commences on that side of the gut which is in direct contact with the stricture. As the separation ad- vances, the opposite adhering sides may perhaps recede somewhat, and a little en- large the angle of union. But it is ever after an angle; and where the peritoneum is deficient, the canal is simply covered in by granulations from the cellular membrane of the parietes coalescing with those of the external or cellular surface of the peri- toneum. * Plate VII.

104 intestine divides the interior coats of the gut, in this effect resembling the operation of a ligature upon an artery*. The peritoneal tunic alone maintains its integrity. The inflamma- tion which the ligature induces on either side ✓ v ' of it, is terminated by the deposition of a coat of lymph exterior to the ligature, which quickly becomes organized. When the ligature thus enclosed is liberated by the ulcerative process, it falls of necessity into the canal, and passes off with its contents. It is much in this manner that the disease termed Xntus-susceptio, in which one portion of the gut is enveloped and strictured by another, not unfrequently undergoes a na- tural cure. The adhesive inflammation pre- ceding the separation of the disorganized part, forms a channel by which the slough « t is voided. A sphacelated hernia sometimes admits of a natural cure upon the same principle; the extremities of the living in- * I have seen this effect produced by a fatal strangulation ia the human intestine.

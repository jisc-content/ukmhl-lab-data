EXPLANATION OF THE PLATES. Fig. 2, Plate III. PLATE V. For the Preparations represented in Figures 1 and 2 I am indebted to the kindness of my preceptor and friend, Dr. Thomson, of Edinburgh. See page 124. Fig. 1 exhibits the internal surface of an intestine united by five interrupted stitches, on the tenth day from the operation. a—The peritoneal union. Some fissures on the everted edges of the villous coat are still apparent, and two of the ligatures remain attached to the lower edge. b—A bosse of adhering omentum. Fig. 2. Dr Thomson’s Second Experiment, (page 125.) The preparation which this figure represents was taken six weeks after the Experiment. The gut is inverted, and the portions of the villous edges upon which the threads hang loosely, are vascular. 1 ’ \ ’ i. Fig. 3 shews the internal surface of an intestine united by a neat continued suture, at ten weeks from the Experi- ment. A small sewing needle and silk ligature were em- ployed. Fig. 4—Union effected in the same way, after a semi-division of the intestine; examined at two months from the Experi- ment. N. B. In these figures the interstice is a mere line ; but the eversion of the edges is distinct. The ligature is wholly disposed of; but the traces of it are still visible in Fig. 3. From a comparison of Figures 1 and 3, I am led to prefer the uninterrupted suture. It approaches nearest to the union after division by stricture.—Compare with

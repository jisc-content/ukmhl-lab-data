Incised and punc- tured wounds admit of the adhesion of the cut edges, or the eversion of the internal coat of the gut, so as to be in many instan- ces actually obliterated; whereas lacerated or ulcerated openings do not admit of these salutary processes. Again, in a transverse section of the bowel, contraction of the cir- cular fibre closes the wound, whereas in a longitudinal section, the contraction of this fibre enlarges it. Such are the circum- stances which, combined in a greater or a less degree, increase or diminish the ten- dency to effusion. M. Petit, in an essay published in the Memoirs of the Surgical Academy of Paris,* has asserted that effusion is resisted during life by the mutual contraction of the muscles * Suite de P Essai sur les Epancliemens.

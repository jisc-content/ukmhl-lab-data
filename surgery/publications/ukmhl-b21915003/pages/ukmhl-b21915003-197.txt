The leading objection raised against the glover’s suture is the difficulty of with- drawing it without injury to the recent adhe- sions ; and the attempt at improvement upon / it uniformly consists in the removal of this difficulty. It was upon the close connection of the injured gut with the parietes exclusively that the union was supposed to depend ; and it w^as not hinted before the time of Mr. Benjamin Bell that the suture would be discharged into the gut. He too speaks of it casually, and in somewhat undecided terms. La Faye expressly enjoins that to hang out at the wound of the teguments, if it is the meaning cf the operator to retain'the wounded part of the intestine in contact with the external opening. This indeed is usually done that we may have it in our power, as it is said, to draw away the ligature on the wound of the gut being cured. It is probable, however, whatever suture may be employed, if more than one or two stitches haye been passed, that it will be diffi- cult, or even impossible, to get the ligature away without hurting the intestines. I •would never advise, therefore, with a view to this, that the ligature should he left out. at the wound ; less danger •,will arise from cutting it entirely away, and allowing the stitches to remain.

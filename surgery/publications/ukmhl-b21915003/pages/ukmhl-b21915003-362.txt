346 acute diffused inflammation. The strangu- lated gut lay coiled up in the omentum, so as to be hidden from the view. The villous coat of the intestines was extensively in- flamed above and below the strangulation. The parts were removed; and a longi- tudinal section of them exhibited the very interesting appearances delineated in Fig. 2, Plate VII. It will be seen by reference, that the omentum had formed a sac, en- veloping the dead piece and the ligature, and had thus speedily accomplished the continuity of the canal. The strangulated portion was perfectly rotten, and nearly detached. The intestines were agglutinated to one another and the surrounding omentum. In this experiment, notwithstanding the destructive vehemence and extent of the inflammation, the effort at restoration was most strikingly evinced. As the appearance carried conviction to my mind that it might be accomplished.

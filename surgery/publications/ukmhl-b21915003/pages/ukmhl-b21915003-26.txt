10 It may be proper to premise a few observa- tions on the structure and morbid dispositions of the parts concerned in this inquiry. The containing and contained parts of the abdo- men present to each other a uniform and â€¢ X ^ . continuous surface of membrane. This mem - brane is of the serous class, and the species of inflammation to which it is especially subject is that which has been denominated the ad- hesive. The membrane lining the intestinal canal is of the mucous class, and the ulce- rative inflammation is the species to which this class is liable. This beneficent provision is an irresistible evidence of the operation of a salutary principle in disease. If the in- flamed peritoneum had run directly into sup- puration, ulceration of the surrounding parts would have been required for an outlet; and if the internal surface of the irritated bowel had tended to form adhesions, the canal would have been in constant danger of obli- teration. The substance intervening be- twixt these membranes presents two orders

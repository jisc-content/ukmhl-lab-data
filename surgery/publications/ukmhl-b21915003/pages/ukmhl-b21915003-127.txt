Ill Experiment Q. Having exposed the intestine of a dog, a silk ligature was applied so as to include a considerable portion of the coats of the gut, and the included portion removed by the scissars. The ligature was left in the external wound which was closed by suture. * In two days the animal recovered his ap- petite, and appeared as well as before the operation. At the end of a fortnight he was killed. Examination. The peritoneal surface was natural; some slender filaments of lymph passed from the cicatrix to the adjacent intestine, and two convolutions of the bowel closely invested the wounded fold. On laying it open, the knot of the liga- ture appeared, loosely filling the orifice and discoloured by the fecal matter. The adhesion of the covering fold was too close to admit of its being raised entire, not- withstanding the intervention of the ligature.

$6 2 the longitudinal order of fibres, to correct the angular disposition of the parts ; i. e. by their action upon the inner or contiguous side, to draw the walls of the gut away from the ring, and resist the contraction of the circular fibres. This he does, conceiving that while the extremities are fixed in an angular position, the distance of their outer or pa- rietal edges must render their adhesion to each other impossible. All this is ingenious; but it is not the* simplicity which charac- terises the operations of Nature. The an- gular disposition is permanent; and the “ retrecissen1ent,,, or contraction of the canal * • at the angle of union, the causes of which have been explained, is not to be prevented. The union cannot be direct where the whole circle is not in opposition. On the outer or parietal side, the canal must be more or . less formed of parts foreign to its texture, after extensive wounds and hernia. In the • .Ml l .. jjJ «.M. , tJ-J, '■ r. , y ■ , > ' former, the judicious use of the suture will restore the integrity of the canal; and in the latter, the adventitious texture

172 A prolapsed intestine may present an inconsiderable wound ; such a wound for example, as would not admit of the diversion of the matters from their natural course while the bowel was subjected to the equal pressure of the abdomen. “ Parva vulnuscula sub operatione hernias non nocere has been affirmed by highly reputed authority ; and Heister is decided upon this point: “ Small wounds of the intestines, that do not exceed in size the diameter of a goose-quill, should by no means be stitched, but are best left to Nature. If they are left to themselves, they will frequently unite much sooner than if they are irritated by the suture; for stitching usually brings on great pain, inflammation, and other bad symptoms; therefore it will be much better to return them instantly, and to bleed the patient, to prevent inflammation, advising him to rest and abstinence.” So also Dionis, Garangeot, Sharp f and Sabatier * Vide Richter, Biblioth.

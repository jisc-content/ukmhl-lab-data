300 sumed its functions. If the gangrene is circumscribed, and affects only a part of the cylinder, whether one or more spots appear, it will be thrown off at the wound, or separate into the canal, without risk of effusion into the belly. If the texture of the part is more extensively destroyed, i. e. uniformly gangrenous, or burst in many places, the whole piece so affected will separate. Now in this case the custom has been to divide the stricture, to draw forward the sound parts, to excise the whole of the dead piece, and to approximate or connect the extremities by one or more sutures, with a view to the re-establishment of the canal. \ I shall consider these several stages of the t t operation.

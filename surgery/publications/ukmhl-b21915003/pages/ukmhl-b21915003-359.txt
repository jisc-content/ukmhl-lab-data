343 At the internal angle the sides adhered to each other. The opposite was closed by adhesions to the omentum and neigh- bouring intestine. Upon carefully laying open the tube, it appeared that the ligature and the ends of the gut had been dis- charged through the canal. At one point the line of union was scarcely completed ; and there appeared a little cyst, like an abscess, communicating with the tube, in which the. tied ends of the gut had been lodged previously to their, being voided. Fig, 1. Plate VII. is a drawing of this pre- paration ; and it will be evident upon com- parison that its appearance so very exactly corresponds with Fig. â€˜2, Plate III. (the union after the ligature of the single tube) as com- pletely to establish the identity of the pro- cesses. It appeared from this experiment, that where a fold was included in a stric- ture, the canal was susceptible of res- toration. if left in contiguity with the peritoneal surface. The operation of the

09 the sphere of the injury. The latter is the result of irritation, by whatever cause ex- cited, and spreads by continuity of surface.* Constitutional disposition, we know, influ- ences in a very sensible degree the charac- ter of a local inflammation in all parts of the body. This continuous inflammation is in some cases erysipelatous, and tending di- rectly to gangrene, but when arising from local injury in a healthy subject, more com- monly assumes a phlegmonous character, and proves fatal in the adhesive stage. Whether the circumscribed inflammation which glues up the wound is essentially the same as that which spreads by continuity to an indefinite extent, it is not necessary for me to inquire. The line of distinction is sufficiently marked by their respective events. The one is al- * This spreading of the inflammation, Mr. Hunter says, is owing to continued sympathy, the surrounding parts sym- pathising with the point of irritation; and in proportion to the health of the surrounding parts and constitution, this sympathy is less; for we find in many states of parts, and many constitu- tions that there is a disposition to this sympathy, and in such the inflammation spreads in proportion, p. 277.

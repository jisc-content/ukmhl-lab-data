58 ther essential advantages are derived from the absolute fulness of the abdomen: that it not only prevents effusion, but pro- vides the means of restoration: that the process of spontaneous reparation essen- tially depends upon the indefinite exten- sion of the peritoneum, (by which mem- branous surfaces identical in their organi- zation and properties are every where op- posed,) and upon its disposition to assume the adhesive inflammation. Thus, if a bowel be wounded lying in contact with the peri- toneum of the muscles, it repairs itself by the mutual adhesion of the cut surfaces ;* another, more distant from the parietes, con- tracts a close adhesion with the contiguous fold, or lays hold of the adjacent omentum.f * The appearance of membranous filaments or bands re- sults from the elongation of the effused lymph, while in a soft or ductile state, by the motion of the parietes and the viscera upon each other, an appearance more frequently exhibited by the pleura. j Ct It does not seem necessary’’ says Mr. Hunter, “ that both surfaces which are to be united should be in a state of in- flammation, for the purpose of effecting an union ; it appears only necessary that one should be in such a state, which is to

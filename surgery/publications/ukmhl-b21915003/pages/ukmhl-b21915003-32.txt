16 passive. If therefore effusion depends, as 0 â–  I am quite willing to admit, upon the action \ \ of the wounded vessel overcoming the op- posed resistance, it follows that it can never happen after death, because action has ceased whilst resistance remains the same. i \ The simple principle, to which I have before adverted, of equal and uniform pres- sure, is that which can alone oppose a steady and efficient resistance to the effusion: of the alimentary matter. That in many cases it does oppose such resistance, and that in some cases it Tails, will be esta- blished by facts which I shall now bring for- ward ; and they will lead to this general conclusion, that the event of effusion is to be apprehended in proportion as this passive resistance is counteracted by the circum- stances of the injury. ; *

254 already stated, and being for the most part complicated with gangrene, they may not improperly be premised to the consideration of that subject. It is surprising how little inconvenience the patient has sustained, where the obstruction has been inconsiderable, and the strictured portion thrown off by gangrene. Hildanus met with a case, evidently of this description. Cases of preternatural appendices of the in- testine becoming strangulated were first de- scribed by Littre, who has laid down pecu- liarities of symptom in partial strangulation, not in all cases to be depended upon. In fact, the constitutional aflection is always proportioned to the extent of the strictured part, or at least to the interference of the stricture with the intestinal function. If the peristaltic action is little interrupted, and con- sequently the passage of the aliment not ma- terially impeded, the symptoms are purely- local* and Nature herself completes the cure. But if the reverse is the case, and the intestinal tunction is deranged, constipation,

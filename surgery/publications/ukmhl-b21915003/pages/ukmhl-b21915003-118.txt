Besides, the mucous coat, which : / * is the part opposed to the surrounding peri- toneum, is not disposed to the adhesive in- flammation.-' 6. Where the tubular continuity is to a certain extent preserved, the obstacles to re- paration are not absolutely insurmountable. 'Under the concurrence of favourable cir- cumstances supposed, the canal may be eked out, though irregularly, by the coap- tation of surrounding folds. In Experiment N such ^n event occurred. The difference in the circumstances of the case is obvious. Retraction is prevented, and the processes of eversion and Contraction modified by the limited extent of the wound. If therefore the adhesive inflammation of the peritoneum

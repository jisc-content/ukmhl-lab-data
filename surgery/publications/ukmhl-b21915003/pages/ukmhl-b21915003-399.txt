It wag pale, perfectly empty, and contracted to its smallest capacity all the waj^ to the caput coli, which held a few knobs of fecal matter. The remainder of the large bowel was collapsed.

I extract the following from a letter which I re- ceived from my friend Dr. Fearon of Sunderland. â€œ The case of which I spoke did not end for a con- siderable time after I heard from you, and at last it did not end as I had expected or wished. I am solicitous to see the detail of your experiments and observations, as the general principles appear to me extremely plausible within certain limits, and they are in a great degree confirmed by the case to which 1 have referred. I forget what I may have formerly said of this, but it was shortly as follows. A small femoral hernia occurred in a man past the middle age* who had been born to good circumstances, but had been reduced to severe manual labour, and who had been a dissolute drunken fellow.

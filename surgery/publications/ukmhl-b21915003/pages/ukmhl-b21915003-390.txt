When the artificial anus is complicated witfy prolapsus, as is most frequently the case wheq the discharge has been long established, it very-rarely admits of cure. The ingenious memoir before cited from the second volume 5 f of the works of Desault, contains all the •* * matter on this subject at present known. Other, cures have been reported; and it is certain that many attempts have failed. * i M. Pelletan, of the Hotel Dieu, protests in his ■t late publication against the authenticity of » these details, and vehemently deprecates the i practice. A It is the prevention of the disease to which I would invite the attention of surgeons, believing it to be as much easier as it is always better than cure. And I would encourage the hope, if it were not pre- sumptuous, that the ideas thrown out in the i course of this Inquiry, may so assist in di- recting the judgment of the profession, as to render of rare occurrence if not to obviate r 1 » < a calamity, which so materially depreciates the blessing of existence.

Where a ligature includes a portion of the paries intestinalis, the process of reparation is precisely similar to that which takes place where no ligature is employed, viz. the adhesive inflammation margining the ulcerated wound in one case, and the simple incised wound in the other, attaches the adjacent peritoneal surface. 8. Ligatures of every description, uncon^ fined at the external wound, separate into fihe canal and pass off with its contents: not from any law of the economy which has been adduced in explanation of some similar invariable phenomena, of which the cause was not obvious, but from their speedy and complete investment by the uniting me- dium. 9.

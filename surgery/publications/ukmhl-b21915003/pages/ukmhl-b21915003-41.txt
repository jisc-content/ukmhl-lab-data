25 From the above facts it appears that effusion is not an ordinary consequence of penetrating wounds. That the same oppo- sition to effusion exists after death as be- fore it, and consequently that such opposition must depend on passive pressure, not on active resistance. If the gut be full and the wound extensive, the surrounding pressure is overcome by the natural action of the bowel tending to the expulsion of the matters. Tut in defect of either of these states, effusion cannot follow. If the canal be empty at the time of the wound, no sub- sequent state of the bowel will cause effu- sion, nor can effusion take place from a bowel at the moment full, provided it re- tains a certain portion of its cylinder entire. sembling whey, which it was very natural under certain prepo- sessions, to mistake for a chylous effusion. I have oftener than once seen a deposition of soft lymph mistaken for alimentary matter, when a closer examination made the difference manifest. But the knowledge of morbid appearances requisite for conduct- ing anatomical investigations with accuracy, the older writers did not possess in a degree sufficient to justify implicit confidence m their statements.

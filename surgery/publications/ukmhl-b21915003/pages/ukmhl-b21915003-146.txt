130 division internally is probably never obli- terated. An intestine treated by suture is always more or less connected by incidental ad- hesions to the contiguous surfaces; these may with some caution be detached from the peritoneal coat. Irregularities of the external surface from exuberances of de- position, seem to depend upon the partial Â©r irregular apposition of the cut extremi- ties ; and the width of the interstice is de- termined by the more or less firm and com- plete contact in which the divided parts are held by the suture. Although the substance of the paries intestinalis is ever after deficient in the line of division, yet by inspection of the exter- nal surface, it would be difficult, if possible to say, where the division had taken place even at a recent period from the injury. In Plate V. the reader may see the pro- gress of restoration at the periods of ten days, six weeks, and nearly three months from the suture.

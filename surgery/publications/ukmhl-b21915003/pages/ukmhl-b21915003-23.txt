/ 7 CHAPTER I, THE ABDOMEN FILLED BY ITS VISCERA STRUCTURE OF THE INTESTINES THEIR WOUNDS SIMPLE AND COMPLI- CATED THE QUESTION, WHETHER WOUNDS OF THE INTESTINES ARE FOL- LOWED BY EFFUSION OF THEIR CON- TENTS INTO THE ABDOMEN, ILLUS- TRATED BY EXPERIMENTS AND RECORDS. The language of anatomists has given famili- arity to an expression which is, strictly speak- ing, inaccurate as applied to any part of an animal body: I refer to the term cavity.* * Mr. Hunter’s is a curious reservation. 66 There is no such thing in an animal body as empty space, exclusive of outlets or reservoirs, which cannot be reckoned internal or circumscribed cavities, for they are perfect by not being such.” Are outlets and reservoirs then empty spaces ? This is one of many exam- ples to be met with in the writings of this great man, of expres- sions so defective in philosophical precision as to obscure the subject which they were intended to illustrate.

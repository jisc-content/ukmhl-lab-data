The treatment of the two wounds is thus made perfectly distinct; and I contend that this distinction, by which the practice is materially simplified*, is indi- cated bv the facts on evidence, viz. the independent restoration of the cylindei, and the provision made for the ligature in that process. The principle of a preternatural connection between the bowel and the tegu- ment where the union is obtained by the suture, upon which all writers have insisted as essential, is a false one; if it were not, a depending ligature would be nugatory y but whoever will carefully examine the process of restoration will come to the stronger conclusion that it is injurious and in direct violation to the procedure of Nature.

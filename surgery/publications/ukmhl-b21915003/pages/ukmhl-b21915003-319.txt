If the stricture were more definite, and resembled more that formed by a ligature, the processes of separation and union would be quicker and more certain. If therefore we divide the stricture, we slacken the process of ulceration, as would be the case, if instead of daily tightening, we relaxed the horse-hair at the basis of an excrescence: the ulceration becomes spread- * ing and irregular, which would otherwise be defined and accurately cylindrical; and what is still a greater evil, the parts are thrown to a distance from each other, which were before in actual contact; and thus, if / vve do not induce a permanent artificial anus, we render the event of union tardy of ac- complishment. I shall further illustrate . — \ * this point in speaking of the mode of union. If any reliance is to be placed upon the arrangements of nature, if the adhesion

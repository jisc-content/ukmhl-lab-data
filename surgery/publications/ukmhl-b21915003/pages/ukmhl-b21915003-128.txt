* Plate 4. Fi#. 1. The mode of reparation in this case is precisely analogous to that which takes place in a punctured wound, or an aperture from V loss of substance in the coats of the gut, where the ligature is not employed: viz. by a close adhesion of the contiguous fold, the internal orifice remaining.* I should observe that in this case the ligature must have fallen into the canal if it had not been confined by the adhering folds.

In such a case all the advantage of the liga- ture is obtained, and this inconvenience avoided by cutting the thread close to the knot, as wras done by Mr. Cooper, at Guyâ€™s Hospital. While performing the operation for a strangulated hernia, an aperture giving issue to its contents was discovered in a

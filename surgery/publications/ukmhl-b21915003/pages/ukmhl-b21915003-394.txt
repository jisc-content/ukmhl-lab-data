He complained greatly of the tightness and pain of his belly, and could not void his urine; a small quantity was drawn off by a catheter. The pain and restlessness increased, and a few minutes before eleven o’clock he cjied. Inspection.—The belly was tumid; the peritoneal surface mottled; a portion of the colic omentum passed through the wound. The anterior edge of the right lobe of the liver was fissured close to the gall bladder, by a wound which would admit the palm of the hand; and opposite to it a lacerated aperture of the size of a shilling appeared in the arch of the colon, marking the track of the slug. The hepatic bile and faeces were copiously effused. Upon intro- ducing my finger into the gut, I drew fropi it a cylin- drical piece of lead, a full inch in length. The pain spffered in the former of these cases was more acute than in the latter; and the discoloration of the peritoneum, though it had the same character, was more vivid. In the former, the bile passed di- rectly from the gall duct into the abdomen, as well a^ the contents of the stomach. Vinous tinctures, which had been taken ip the commencement of the attack must have aggravated the pain. In the latter case, the hepatic bile and blood oozed f^om the cleft of the liver over the, intestines. The lead was so situated as to have admitted of a ready evacuation per anum, and but for the accompanying wound of the liver, this young man would probably have recovered.—See the case quoted from Ravaton, page 63.

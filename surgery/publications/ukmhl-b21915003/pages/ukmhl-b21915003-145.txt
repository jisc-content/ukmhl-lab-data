The action of the longitudinal fibres being opposed to the artificial connection, the sections mutually recede as the sutures loosen by the process of ulcerative absorp- tion.- During this time, the lymph de- posited becomes organized, by which further retraction is prevented, and the original cylinder, with the threads attached to it, are * - .v encompassed by the new tunic. The gut ulcerates at the points of the ligatures, and these fall into its canal.

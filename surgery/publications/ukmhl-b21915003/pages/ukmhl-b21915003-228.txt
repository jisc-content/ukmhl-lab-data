The countenance of the patient now became extremely anxious : his pulse above an hundred, and small— thirst extreme—breathing' interrupted by sighs, and frequent eructations—no passage of flatus by the bowels, and a painful sensa- tion of tenesmus. In the evening, all the symptoms were aggravated : the pulse not much quicker, but the pain more severe. He had hiccough, and cramps in the calves of his legs, and was very apprehensive of his situation. At night the belly swelled, the pain reached round to his shoulders, back, and loins, so as to require continual friction; the vomiting was plainly faecal, and almost incessant: towards morning he was greatly agitated, and with difficulty kept in bed.

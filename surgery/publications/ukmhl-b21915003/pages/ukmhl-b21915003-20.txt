4 this analogy has afforded, it is reasonable to presume that the doctrines of pathology must admit of a similar mode of illustration. Although the acknowledged varieties in the constitution of man and animals do not per- mit eyery inference from the powers and ac- tions of one to be applied to the other, yet are there striking features of resemblance in the phenomena ensuing upon mechanical in- jury, some of which have already been ap- \ j. plied, and more admit of application to im- portant practical purposes. A minute acquaintance with the operations of nature furnishes two leading indications. First—when and how to avoid a prejudicial interference with those operations: secondly —by what means to assist them when sus- ceptible of aid. For want of this knowledge these indications have generally been over- looked in the treatment of intestinal lesions.

97 harrowed by the half eversion, but offered ho impediment to the passage of fluids*, * Plate 3. Fig. 1, I have more than once repeated this expe- riment but have not succeeded in obtaining a parallel to its inte- resting result. The reader may not be aware that in performing such experiments, considerable difficulties present themselves. In cases of division it is not always easy to replace the dissevered parts in precise opposition. The omentum frequently protrudes in quantity before the gut, when if it be retrenched and returned, there is much risk of hemorrhage ; if the whole of the pro- trusion be returned, it generally forms a hernia at the muscular wound and is either interposed between the sections, or forms complicated adhesions around them. I have not recorded such examples, as the circumstances appeared to preclude the possibi- lity of restoration. The duodenum is the only small intestine of the dog unco- vered by the epiploon, which from its immediate continuity with the stomach, is not to be preferred as the subject of expe* riments. The bowel sometimes protrudes with such force and ra- pidity, even through a small wound, as to be with difficulty res- trained, and in other instances does not appear at a larger open- ing, a difference determined by the resistance which the animal opposes. In an extensive prolapse, it requires much caution to prevent extensive adhesions, and the same consequences to an in- definite extent attend every attempt to bring forward the gut by artificial means. Such are some of the difficulties which foil the \ best concerted schemes of the experimenter, and render his un- embarrassed operations more the result of accident than Â©f skill. n \

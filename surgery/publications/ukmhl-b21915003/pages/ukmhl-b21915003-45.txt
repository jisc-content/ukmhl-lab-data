r 2g give the slightest countenance to this opinion, we find that a rupture pre-existed, by which the gut had contracted an adhesion to the peritoneum. Such is the obvious explana- tion of the cases of Collignon and Pineau.* It is at the present day generally admitted, that effusion from the intestine in whatever degree is fatal; and this impression joined to the prevailing idea that it is the uniform con- sequence of a wound, places the practical importance of the present question in a strong point of view. It is probable that in many cases on this account abandoned as hopeless, the efforts of the practitioner might have been successfully exerted to suppress the inflammation inseparable from the injury. Deodatus in a letter to Hildanus gives the case of a young weaver stabbed with a small sword. The sword entered above the umbili- cus, and made its exit on the left loin.

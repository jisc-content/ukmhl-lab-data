117 * Plate 4. Fig, 2. Examination. The peritoneum appeared hi chi v inflamed. Adhesions were formed O among the neighbouring tolds, and lymph was deposited in masses upon the sides of the wounded gut. This presented two large circular orifices*. Among the viscera were found a quantity ot bilious fluid, and some extraneous substances, and a worm was depending from one of the apertures. By the artificial connection of the edges in a single point of their circumference, and their natural connec- tion at the mesentery, they could recede only in the intervals, and here they had receded to the utmost. The suture pre- vented the contraction of the circular fibres, from the obliquity produced by the more powerful action of the longitudinal between the two fixed points. All circumstances therefore combined to facilitate effusion, the obvious cause of the quickly destruc- tive inflammation.

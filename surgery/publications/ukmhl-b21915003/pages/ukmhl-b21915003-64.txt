48 CHAPTER II. REMARKS ON THE ADHESIVE INFLAMMA- TION OF THE PERITONEUM PROCESS OF REPARATION IN THOSE COMPLICATED WOUNDS WHICH ARE UNATTENDED BY & i FECULENT DISCHARGE, OR PROLAPSE OF THE BOWEL THEIR CONSEQUENCES AND TREATMENT. * The disposition of the pleura and perito- neum to assume the adhesive inflammation is well known to anatomists.* Various causes induce this inflammation. From the frequency of pulmonary adhesion it would appear, that the pleura is more sub- * The deeper seated parts of the body, and more especially the vital, very readily admit of the adhesive inflammation, which is proved by dissections; for we hardly ever open a human subject where there arc not in the circumscribed cavi- ties considerable adhesions.â€”Hunter on the Blood, p.235.

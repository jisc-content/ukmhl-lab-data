I 1 54 ' . i wound ; one of the most direct and powerful checks upon the energies of the system. Blood-letting is therefore our only resource. But in the latter species of wound, not only is a morbid accumulation of mat- % ters prevented, but by the quick discharge of the aliment the process of sanguifi- cation is so materially repressed, that we have rather to guard against the effect of exhaustion, than the excess of inflam- matory action. This fact explains why the febrile commotion is comparatively slight' in this class of intestinal wounds, why the belly is free from tension, and other marks of a peritoneal affection rarely appear, and why on the other hand, if the discharge be suddenly checked, these symp- toms speedily present themselves. Hence doubtless has arisen the practice of dilating * i the wound, which though by no means a practice to be employed indiscriminately, in many cases, as in that of M. Frou- â€¢ N mantin, has preserved the lives of patients.

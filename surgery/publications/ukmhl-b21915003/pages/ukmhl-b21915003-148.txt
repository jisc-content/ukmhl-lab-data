I 132 ligatures invariably pass into the canal; their separation externally would have interrupted the healing process, as vye find to be the case in other parts to which they are applied. I shall now briefly recapitulate the prin- cipal facts established by experiment in the preceding chapters, in the form of co- rollaries. 1. Effusion of the intestinal matters rarely takes place in penetrating wounds. The impediment to effusion consists, first, in the resistance which the mechanism of the abdomen opposes, and secondly, in the cir- cumstances contingent upon and peculiar to intestinal wounds. By the former state- ment I mean the general contact and equal pressure before explained ; by the latter, the processes of eversion, contraction, and peritoneal adhesion. 2. Effusion of the'intestinal matters more readily takes place from lacerated and ul- i consistent with the indisposition of the mucous surface to the adhesive inflammation to infer, that it does not readily admit of the granulating process, which is only an advanced stage of that inflammation.

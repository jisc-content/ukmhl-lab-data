But the object of this exposure of the sound parts is to excise the dead piece and unite them. When Nature has destined the separation what advantage is gained by this inter- ference ? Is such a practice warranted by analogy i Few surgeons of experience will presume to interfere with Nature in the re- moval of a limb in a state of gangrene. It can hardly be, that the peritoneal surface adjacent to the hernia is as healthy and as susceptible of the adhesive inflammation as in the case of feqent wound. But suppose the sphacelus to have taken place, and the living parts to be in perfect health, will they be more advan- tageously situated by an artificial apposi- tion than if left to cast off at the wound ? t The mere apposition of two portions of unadhering intestine by a single ligature is a practice fraught with imminent danger. The partial apposition, by stitches, by which i

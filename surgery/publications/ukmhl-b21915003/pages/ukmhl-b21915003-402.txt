EXPLANATION OF THE PLATES. PLATE II. • i ' Fig. 1 represents the mode of reparation of an aperture in the intestine. (See Exper. D, page 55.) a—A portion of the peritoneum lining the abdominal muscles. b—The wounded gut. c—A band of lymph passing from the peritoneum, uniting the contiguous folds, and thus obliterating the triangular interstice betwixt them. d—An incision into the lymph connecting the folds by which a probe passed obliquely through the aperture, still complete in b. Fig. 2 represents, in a transverse section of the small in- testine, the consequent eversion and contraction, and the obliteration of the tube by a plug of chylous matter. (See Exp. L, page 94.) a.a—The everted lips strictured and rendered tumid by the strong circular contraction of the tube at their bases. The diameter of the tube is marked by that of the con- densed alimentary matter shutting up the orifices of the bowel, so as to render the surfaces plain, and prevent the escape of fluids.

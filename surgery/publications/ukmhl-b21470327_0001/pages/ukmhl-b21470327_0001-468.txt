436 DISEASES OF THE EYE. [book hi. comm. the eye inclines towards the nose. He correctly explains that L-^-J the complaint arises from spasms or paralysis of some of the mus- cles of the eye. On ecpiesmus, or protrusion of the eyes. This section is taken from Oribasius. (Syn. viii, 50.) Aetius, Avicenna, and Rhases recommend the same treatment for this complaint, which can only arise from suffocation, violent straining, or swelling of the eye. On synchysis, or confusion of sight. Aetius and Oribasius treat of this affection in nearly the same words. Rowley defines synchysis to be "a solution of the vitreous hu- mour into a fine attenuated aqueous fluid." It does not appear to us that the ancients understood it in this sense, or that they meant anything more by it than a confusion or disorder of the eye occasioned by a blow. On myopia. This section also is taken from Oribasius or Aetius. Alsaharavius treats of it by the name of alhayn. He says it sometimes arises from external causes, such as exposure to snow and cold, in which case he directs us to apply stimulant fumes to the eye and refrigerants to the head. Although the ancients were aware of the magnifying powers of specula (as appears from Seneca, 'Quaest. Natur.'), it is doubtful if they ever thought of applying this knowledge to any useful purpose; and hence none of the Greek, Latin, or Arabian medical authors make any men- tion of spectacles or magnifying glasses as a remedy for this com- plaint, or for weakness of sight. Dutens, however, maintains that they were not unacquainted with telescopes, (p. ii, 10.) From a passage in Iamblichus it has been supposed that they also used microscopes. (Vit. Pyth. 26.) One of the causes of myopia mentioned by Jesu Haly is enlargement of the crystalline lens, which he recommends us to endeavour to lessen by means of dissolvents. (De Oculis, iii, 6.)

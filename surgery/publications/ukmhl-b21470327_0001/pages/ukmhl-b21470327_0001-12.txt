Vlil ADVERTISEMENT. admitted that there are grounds for this objection; and if I had the work to do over again, I should most probably take pains to obviate it, in some degree, at least. But to remedy the omission, after the work was completed on its present plan, would have been a task of immense labour to me, without bringing a correspondent advantage to my readers. Moreover, I am convinced that, even as they stand, the references will, in general, be found sufficient to guide those who have an ac- quaintance with the originals to the places indicated; and to those who are unacquainted with them, this strict system of quotation would be of no use, further than to inspire them with a greater degree of confidence in the accuracy and pains-takmg research of the Editor. It may be proper for me, then, to state that I have made it an invariable rule never to quote at second- hand, nor to make any reference to the opinions of an author whose works I have not myself carefully examined. Many readers, I fear, will find considerable difficulty with the names of the Compound Medicines which occur throughout this volume; and may be disposed to think it was the duty of the Commentator to explain them as they occur. In answer to this objection, I beg to state, that these compositions will be fully described in the third and last volume, which treats of the Materia Medica and Pharmacy; and on this account I thought it unnecessary to notice them elsewhere. The General Index, which will be given at the end of the work, will also facilitate reference in such cases. F. A. Banchory, August 17th, 1844.

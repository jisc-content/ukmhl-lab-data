373 CARUS. SECT. XI.] If cams supervene upon fatuity or oblivion, it also is to be at- tended to as formerly mentioned under the head of lethargy, where Ave also stated the discrimination between these com- plaints. CoMMEN tary. See most of the authors on lethargy and Comm. catalepsy. ' * 1 Nonnus says that carus resembles apoplexy, only that in the latter disease the posterior ventricle of the brain is more espe- cially loaded with serum, whereas in carus the anterior is af- fected. It differs also, he says, from lethargy, in this respect, that fever precedes carus, but is subsequent to an attack of lethargy. Carus, he adds, is occasioned by a blow, pain of the head, and fracture of the bone compressing the brain. Alexander also says that, in earns, the anterior part of the brain is most affected; ami hence the sensorial powers are much impaired. It is occasioned, he says, by violent pains which dissipate the vital spirits. On the cure of loss of memory, see Galen (de Loc. Affect, iii, 5.) Avicenna has treated at great length of the subjects of this Section. Among other things he recommends the celebrated theriac, which contained a very diffusible stimulant oil. His treatment otherwise resembles our author's. The same may be said of Haly Abbas. For loss of memory, Alsaharavius recom- mends the application of fragrant and stimulant oils to the head, along with general treatment. Crelius Aurelianus and Octavius have not treated of carus by name; but, according to Prosper Alpinus, the Methodists entertained similar opinions of the disease to the other sects. (De Med. Meth. x, 5.) Procopius states that carus was a common symptom of the fatal plague which prevailed in the reign of Justinian. (Persic, ii.) The philosophers, as well as the physicians, taught that loss of memory is often connected with disease of the posterior por- tion of the brain. See, in particular, the Commentary of Phi- loponus on Aristotle (de Anima, i.)

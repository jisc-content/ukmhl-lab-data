The cure. If the pain shoot to the clavicle, we must straight- way open a vein j or if to the hypochondrium, we must purge downwards. Physicians of late, in all cases, have recourse to venesection, apprehending, I suppose, the disturbance occasioned by purging. When the strength prevents us from having re- course to either of these remedies, we must use stimulant clys- ters ; and if the pain is moderate, after the clyster Ave may give honied water, and the juice of ptisan and of chondrus.

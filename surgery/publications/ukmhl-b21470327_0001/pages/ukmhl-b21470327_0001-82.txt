ON COLD. [book i. Comm. as as the oil of lilies or narcissus, to which costus castor, musk, i ) Galen remarks, that the effects of opium, and of r ;5Lre of the body to extreme cold, are very like. (Comment, in Epidem. Hippocrat) { In the 4th hook of Xenophon's < Anabasis, theie is an m tere^d-cription of the effects resulting from the exposure rf ZGrecian U to extreme cold and the means which they took to preserve themselves from being injured by it Ine â€¢tin relates that they rubbed themselves beta, the fii. with an ointment composed of swmes' seam, and o Is of sesame, I biUer almonds, and of turpentine. ^^^^ of Hannibal, in like manner, when exposed to great cold among the mountains of Italy, rubbed their bodies with oil as a pro- tection from its effects, and with great success if we may be- lieve krns the historian: he says, "tunc callidissimi hostes Widum et nivalem nactidiem, quam se ignibus prius, oleoque fovissent, (horribile dictu !) homines a meridie, et sole venientes nostra nos Heme vicerunt (Hist. Rom. ii, 6 ) It is worthy of remark, by the way, that Baron Larrey, m his account of the retreat of the French army from Moscow, states that the inha- bitants of southern climates endured the cold better than those of the north. The fact that the Carthaginian soldiers rubbed their bodies with oil on the occasion we have mentioned is stated also by Polybius (Hist, iii, 72), and by Livy (Hist. Roman, xxi, 55.) Quintus Curtius relates that the soldiers of Alexander the Great rubbed their bodies with the juice of sesame, instead of oil, when exposed to intense cold while crossing the Bactnan mountains, (vii, 15.) Pliny, with his usual terseness, thus states the powers ot oil in protecting the body both from cold and heat: " Oleo natura tepefacere corpus, et contra algores munire; eidemque fervores capitis refrigerare." (Hist. Nat. xv, 6.)

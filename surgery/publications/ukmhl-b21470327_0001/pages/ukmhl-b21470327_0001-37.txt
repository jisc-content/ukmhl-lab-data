SECT. II.] THE NURSE. 5 of spinning are proper. About the eighth month, which is the Com most critical period of pregnancy, the diet is to be more con- w tracted, and the exercise increased. If the bowels are consti- pated owing to compression of the rectum, by the enlarged uterus, laxative food is to be given, such as ptisan and mallows. In the ninth month the regimen is to be of a relax- ing nature, and for this purpose the tepid bath is to be fre- quently taken, for it has a great effect in rendering parturition easy.

Let the nurse also abstain from venery. Let her work with her hands and shoulders, let her labour at the mill and the loom, and carry about the child in her arms. This may be done for three or four months. Commentary. This Section is taken from Oribasius. (Sy- Com nops. v, 2.) 1 Aetius gives somewhat fuller directions.

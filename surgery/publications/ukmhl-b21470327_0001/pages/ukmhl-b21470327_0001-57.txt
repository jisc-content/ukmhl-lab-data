The cricilasia appears to have been a large hoop, or circle, w hich was rolled on the ground. Even Mercurialis admits the obscurity of Oribasius's description of it. (Med. Collect, vi, 26.) The petaurum was a scat suspended by ropes, in which seat the person taking the exercise sat, and was tossed about by assistants. It is mentioned bv Juvenal (Sat. xiv), and Martial (Epigr. xi, 22.) Antyllus thus describes the effects of equitation on the human frame: "It strengthens the body, especially the stomach, more than any other mode of exercise; it clears the organs of the senses, and renders them more acute; but it is most inimical to the thorax." Oribasius (Med. Collect, vi, 24), Pliny (Hist. Nat. xxviii, 4-), and Aetius agree with Antyllus as to the good effects of equitation on the stomach.

The sedan and chair are often mentioned by the Latin poets, as well as by the medical writers. It is suf- ficient for our purpose to state that they were so constructed, that one could either sit or lie in them. They sometimes had windows, formed from the lapis specularis.

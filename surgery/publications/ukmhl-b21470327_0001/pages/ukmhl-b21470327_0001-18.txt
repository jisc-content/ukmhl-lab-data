x;v EDITOR'S PREFACE. general outline of their system would appear to have borne a striking resemblance to that of the sect which started up in Edinburgh towards the end of the last century, called the Brunonian, from the name of its ingenious but fanciful founder, Dr. Brown.

What confidence docs a writer deserve who states, for example,

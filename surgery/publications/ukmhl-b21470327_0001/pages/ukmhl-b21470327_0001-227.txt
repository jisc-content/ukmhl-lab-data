195 SFXT. VII.] CRITICAL DAYS. trariwise to these. But the 13th has been shown to possess an intermediate character. Some of these are such as to prove critical if they experience even the most moderate impetus of nature, such as the 7th and 14th; whilst most of them prove critical in violent commotions of the system, but not otherwise. Neither are the favorable all equally favorable, nor the unfa- vorable all equally unfavorable ; nor is their favorableness and unfavorableness according to any order. Those in the first rank arranged thus : the best of all are the 7th and 14th, next to them the 9th, and 11th, and 20th; and near to them the 17th and 5th, after these the 4th, after it the 3d and 18th. Opposed to them, of the second rank, are these : the worst, which proves obscurely critical with danger, and is, as it were, diametrically opposed to the 7th, is the 6th: near to it are the 8th and 10tit, after these the 12th, 16th, and 19th. Intermediate between these is the 13th, being neither so objectionable as those of the second rank, nor so powerful in freeing from diseases as those of the first. The critical days then are thus arranged according to their degree by Galen. Numerically thus : the favorable are the 3d, 4th, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 14th, 17th, 18th, 20th j the unfavorable, the 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, 19th; the intermediate, the 13th. Some of the cri- tical days give information concerning the others, and are hence called indicatory by Hippocrates, because they indicate the crisis that is to happen on another critical day. Thus the 4th indicates a crisis on the 7th, by inducing sweats, perspirations, or some such particular evacuation, or by displaying certain signs which had not formerly taken place, or some symptoms of concoction. Galen says that the 4th is indicatory of the 6th, although it be unfa- vorable, as the 11th is of the 14th, and the 17th of the 20th. Until the 14th day the crises are the most decided, next to these until the 20th; from the 20th to the 40th they gradually lose their decided character. Of these, the first in degree are the 27th, 34th, and 40th, after which are the 24th and 32d. The other numbers intermediate between the 20th and 40th are in- determinate, and those after the 40th are not properly critical, as they terminate diseases by concoctions and abscesses rather than by crises. Hippocrates seems entirely to disregard all those after the 40th day, yet he enumerates the 60th, 80th, and 100th. After these, he says that some diseases prove critical in seven

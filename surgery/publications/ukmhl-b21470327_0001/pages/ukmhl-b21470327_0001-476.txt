He also â€”' praises myrrh, aloes, alum, and red arsenic, as ingredients m the applications to ulcers of the ears. When the ulcers are chronic, they are first to be cleansed by such applications as the decoction of wormwood in wine, or oxymel of squills, with a small quantity of the flowers of copper; then they are to be dressed with the usual incarnants; and, lastly, they are to be dried or cicatrized by compositions containing aloes, myrrh, and frankincense.

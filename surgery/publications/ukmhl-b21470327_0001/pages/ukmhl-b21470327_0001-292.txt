XXIX. ON THE DIAGNOSIS OF AllDENT FEVERS. j The following symptoms accompany ardent fevers: tongue dry, rough, and black, griping of the stomach, excrements pale, strong thirst, watchfulness, and sometimes delirium. 4M. Commentary. Our author's description of the>, causus or ardent fever, is taken from Hippocrates (de Rat. Vic. Acut. , where the commentary of Galen is worth consulting. Accord- in- to Hippocrates, the cansus is generally produced m the summer season, owing to the veins becoming dry and attracting bilious humours. In other parts of his works he gives an ac- count of several varieties of the disease, differing considerably in character from that described in the above-mentioned work. For example, one variety mentioned in his < Epidemics' was dis- tinguished by the absence of thirst and delirium, and by the paroxvms occurring on the even days. (See Galen's Commen- tary Opera, ed.

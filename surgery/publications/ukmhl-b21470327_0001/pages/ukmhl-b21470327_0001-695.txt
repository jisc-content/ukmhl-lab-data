For pains occasioned by intense cold, or infarction of tlie joints, this is a powerful remedy: Of old oil, lb. iss; of Alexandrian nitre, lb. j j of turpentine, lb. j; of euphorbium, oz. j ; of iris, oz. ij; of the flour of fenugreek, a sextarius and a half. In these cases the remedies recommended for ischiatics are excellently applicable.

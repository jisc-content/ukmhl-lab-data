x EDITOR'S PREFACE. a convenient arrangement of my subject, and at the same time, by giving a close translation of it into English, I saw that I would be enabled to enrich our medical literature with one of the most valuable relics of ancient science. By following this correct and faithful guide, by supplying his omissions and en- larging his plan, when necessary, from the more copious works of his predecessors, and by adding, in all cases, the improvements of subsequent ages, down to the latest date of ancient literature, I am in hopes that I have been able to present the reader with a work from which he may, at one view, become acquainted with the prevailing opinions upon all the most important matters con- nected with medical practice during a period of more than fifteen centuries.

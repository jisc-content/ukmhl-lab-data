ON THE MOLLUSCA. The mollusca, such as polypi, sepiaj, and loligines, are hard and indigestible, and particularly the polypi. Their juices are saltish, but when digested they furnish considerable nourishment to the body. Commentary. Galen remarks that the mollusca, or mollia, Comm. have no scales, nor any rough testaceous skin, but a soft one, ' like that of men. Their flesh, he says, is hard, indigestible, and contains a small proportion of saltish juices; but, if digested, it affords no little nourishment to the body. The sepia, or cuttle-fish, was anciently, and is at present, much used in Rome as an article of food. Pliny states that it is laxative. He adds that it is taken in food, boiled with oil, salt, and barley-meal. Simeon Seth says of it, that it is difficult to digest, but that, if digested, it affords considerable nourishment to the body, and engenders crude humours; on which account, it ought to be taken with acrid condiments, and an old thin wine drunk after- wards.

The term polypus is vaguely applied, and may comprehend several species of hydra. SECT. XCI1I. ON THE CARTILAGINOUS FISHES. Of the cartilaginous fishes, the torpedo and pastinaca have soft and sweet flesh, which passes readily downwards, is easily di- gested, and proves nutritive. The flairs (raiae), skates {leviraia),

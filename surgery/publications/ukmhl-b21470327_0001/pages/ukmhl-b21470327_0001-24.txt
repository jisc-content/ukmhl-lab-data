AUTHOR'S PREFACE. XX ticularly of those which I had mentioned in the preceding Six Books, and more especially the greater and, as it were, celebrated preparations. For I did not think it proper to treat of all these articles promiscuously, lest it should occasion confusion, but so that any person looking for one or more of the dis- tinguished preparations might easily find it. Towards the end are certain things connected with the Composition of Medicines, and of those articles which may be substituted for one another : the whole concluding with an account of Weights and Measures.

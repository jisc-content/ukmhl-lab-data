AUTHOR'S PREFACE. XVlll there is an abundant supply of books, whereas physicians have to act not only in cities, in the fields, and in desert places, but also at sea in ships, where such diseases sometimes sud- denly break out as, in the event of procrastination, would occasion death, or at least incur the most imminent danger. But to remember all the rules of the healing art, and all the particular substances connected with it, is exceedingly difficult if not altogether impossible. On this account I have compiled this brief collection from the works of the ancients, and have set down little of my own, except a few things which I have seen and tried in the practice of the art. For being conversant with the most distinguished writers in the profession, and in particular with Oribasius, who, in one work, has given a select view of everything relating to health (he being posterior to Galen, and one of the still more recent authors), I have collected what was best in them, and have endeavoured, if possible, not to pass by any one distemper. For the work of Oribasius, comprehending seventy books, contains indeed an exposition of the whole art, but it is not easily to be procured by people at large on account of its bulk, whilst the epitome of it, inscribed to his son Eustathius, is deficient in some diseases altogether, and gives but an imperfect description of others, sometimes the causes and diagnosis being omitted, and sometimes the proper plan of treatment being forgotten, as well as other things which have occurred to my recollection. Wherefore the present work will contain the description, causes, and cure of all diseases, whether situated in parts of uniform texture, in particular or- gans, or consisting of solutions of continuity, and that not merely in a summary way, but at as great length as possible.

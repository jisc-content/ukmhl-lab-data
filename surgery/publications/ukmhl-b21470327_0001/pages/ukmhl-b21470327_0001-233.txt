SECT- »J CRISIS. 201 « fever may terminate favorably, namely, by an evacuation, Comm. by an imperfect crisis without an evacuation, and by resolution, ^ that is to say, when the febrile symptoms go off gradually. There are likewise three unfortunate terminations; for the pa- tient may die suddenly with much agitation, or in consequence of a metastasis, or he may be slowly wasted by a marasmus. Averrhoes enumerates the same kinds of critical evacuation as Galen, and otherwise treats of them very judiciously. (Collig. iv, 89.) Avicenna gives a long account of all the circumstances attending the crisis, but he copies closely from Galen and 11 ippoqrates. (iv, 2,1.) Haly Abbas, in like manner, is sensible and correct, but borrows from the Greeks. (Theor. x, 10) The account given by Rhases is excellent, but it differs Httle from our author's. (Ad Mansor. x, 27.) In his 'Continens/ he gives a tull exposition of the Galenic doctrines, with his own Com- mentaries. He states, that a crisis may take place in six ways: by hemorrhage at the nose, by an alvinc evacuation, by vomit- ing, by a discharge of urine, by a sweat, or by an aposteme. (xxxi.) SECT. XI. HOW TO DETERMINE WHETHER A PAST CRISIS BE FAVORABLE. If a proper evacuation takes place after the concoction, and the fever is resolved by the critical evacuation; if the patient is freed from all other symptoms; if his colour has improved in proportion to the evacuation; if his pulse has become more re- gular, and his strength better in rising out of bed; and, what is the most salutary symptom of all, if these are accompanied by repose of the constitution, this may be pronounced to be the best possible crisis. If any of these be wanting, the goodness of the crisis will diminish proportionally to the force of the di- minution. Commentary. This requires no Commentary.

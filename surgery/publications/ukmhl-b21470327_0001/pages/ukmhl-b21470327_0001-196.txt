The fish called ffm. in French <~.^^^ and its eongener the lahrus hepatus L. are briefly noticed by the dietetical authorities as wholesome fishes. On the salmon the Greek anthers are entirely silent. It briefly noticed by Pliny (H. N. is, 32); but the fnst and^on y satisfLtory account of it which 3. to be found m ^^ classic is contained in the Mosella of Ausonms. We shall giie an extract from the lines in which it is first described: « Teque inter species geminas, neutrumque et utrumque, Qui necdum Salmo, nec jam Salar, ambiguusque Amborum medio Fario intercepte sub aevo." Here we find marked the three progressive stages in the growth of the fish. The salar is the sea-trout, the fano is what in the north of Scotland is called the grilse, and the salmo is the full-grown salmon. Of the salmon he says: " Tu loricate- squamosus pectore, frontem Lubricus, et dubise facturus fercula caense, Tempora longarum fers incorrupte morarum, Prsesiguis maculis capitis : cui prodiga nutat Alvus, opimatoque fluens abdoiuine venter." The sea-trout is well described in the following line : " Purpureisque Salar stellatus tergora guttis." Nonnius considers the salmon to be the anchorago oi Cassiodorus. (De Esu Piscium, 81.) Gesner holds the same opinion. (De Aquat.)

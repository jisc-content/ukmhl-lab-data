THE PLAGUE. SECT. XXXVI.] 285 " nullo cessabant tempore apisci Ex aliis alios avidi eontagia morbi." (L. 1235.) And afterwards, " Qui fucrant autem praesto contagibus ibant." (L. 1241.) Ovid, in like manner, says of the dead bodies: " Afflatuque nocent et agunt eontagia late." (Metam. v, 551.) And so also, Silius Italicus: " Et posuere avidaj mortis eontagia pestes." (Lib. xiv.) The historians we must dismiss in a few words, with stating that allusions to the infectious nature of certain diseases are to be met with in Livy, Dionysius the Halicarnassian, Diodorus Siculus, Appian, Plutarch, Quintus Curtius, Dio Cassius, Eusebius, Gregory of Nyssa, and Evagrius. Procopius was a non-contagionist. The philosopher Aristotle, in one of his problems, makes it a question why the plague is the only disease which infects those who approach the sick. (Probl. i.) There is a curious passage in the works of the orator Isocrates, which shows that con- sumption was reckoned contagious in his days. (iEginet.) The elder Pliny mentions the contagion of the pestilence. (Hist. Kat. xxxiii, 80.) Virgil mentions the infectious nature of certain diseases of cattle. (Eel. i, Georg. iii, 464.) The ancient writers on vete- rinary surgery and agriculture in like manner state that the plague and scabies of cattle are infectious. See Columella (vi, 5); Vegetius (Mulomed. iii, 23.) The philosopher Marcus Antoninus alludes to the plague as being contagious, (ix, 2.) Chrysostom does the same. (In Joan. Orat. lvii.) The language of Seneca is very precise : " Itaque ut in pestilentia cavendum est ne corruptis jam corporibus et morbo flagrantibus assideamus, quia pericula trahemus, affla- tuque ipso laborabimus." (De Tranquil, vii.) To these we may join Isidoms Hispalensis, a much later writer: " Pestilentia est contagium quod quum unum apprehenderit celeriter ad plures

Constriction is occasioned either by obstruction or contraction of the pores. Obstruction is produced either by the quantity or thickness of crude and indigested humours, and contrac- tion by such things as are cold or astringent, or desiccative. Upon stripping the body, the affection is at once recognized by the paleness, hardness, and contraction of the skin, and by the body's being heated with difficulty during exercise. Calefacient remedies are the proper cure for this state of body, and there- fore we must have recourse to the strongest exercise and the hottest baths, and the time of remaining in the cold bath must not be long, nor must the water be very cold. And when about to put on their clothes, let their bodies be anointed with a sweet and thin oil, of a moderately heating quality. Ob- structions of the skin are also properly cured by the oil of dill, (more particularly if the dill had been green,) and by the oil of black poplars. Commentary. This Section is taken from Oribasius. (Synops. Comm. v, 16.) But a somewhat fuller account is given by Galen. (Hyg. ' *"~ Hi, 10.) Like our author, he states, that this affection is occa- sioned, either by a collection of thick viscid humours in the body, or by contraction, that is to say, spasm of the cutaneous pores. It is generally brought on, he says, by exposure to cold, or going into an astringent bath. He gives very minute direc- tions about the treatment, recommending hot baths, and fric- tion with oils of a calefacient and attenuant nature. See also Aetius (iv, 46); and Actuarius (Meth. Med. iii, 16.) Avicenna treats of it in the same terms as Galen, (i, 3, 3, 15.) SECT. XXII. ON SPONTANEOUS LASSITUDE.

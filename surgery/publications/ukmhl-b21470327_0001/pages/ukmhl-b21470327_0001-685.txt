653 sect, lxxvii.] ISCIIIATIC DISEASE. the rind of the root of capers in a draught, or added to the cataplasms, is of use. When the pain is great, anodynes may have place, such as the antidote of Philo and that from two poppers. This injection is to be used : Of honey, iss cyathus ; of oil, iss cyathus; of water, ij cyathi; of nitre, dr. viij; of tur- pentine, dr. iv. These are to be injected warm, and the anus fomented, that they may be the longer retained. It evacuates mucous matters, and sometimes blood when it affords more re- lief. But if the complaint be prolonged, which is rare, we must repeat it frequently, instead of the water substituting the de- coction of centaury. Blood is also evacuated by injecting the seed of treacle-mustard, and the juice of elaterium, and the Sicyonian oil prepared from it, or from the roots of the plant.

The natural baths also are proper; or if these be not at hand, they may bathe in the others; using the restorative ointments formerly mentioned, and the compound ones,â€”the iEsculapian, and that composed of equal portions of euphorbium, adarce,black hellebore, castor, pellitory, pepper, and wild grape dried. After the bath, we must sprinkle upon the skin while still warm, of dried pitch, oz. iij ; and of native sulphur, oz. ij ; and let the part be covered with paper. If even these things do not succeed, a remnant of the disease remaining, it will be proper to apply a cataplasm of mustard along with dried figs, or by itself. These complaints are completely removed by the Iberian herb, which some call lepidium, and some the wild cardamus (cress). And the shrub which grows among us, having leaves resembling those of the bay, but much larger, is of ap-

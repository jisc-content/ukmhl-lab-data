[ BOOK I. 28 FRICTION. SECT. Will. ON THE KINDS OF FRICTION. Hard friction contracts, and soft relaxes; so that those poi - sons that are relaxed should be rubbed hard, and those that are immoderately constricted, softly; and when, neither in the one state nor the other, it is clear that neither the one mode of friction nor the other should be had recourse to, but as much as possible either extreme ought to be avoided. For much and hard friction diminishes the bulk of the body, whilst, on the other hand, little and soft distends it. If the three different kinds of frictions as to quantity be joined to the same number as to quality, they will produce nine combinations, as is stated below. For one of the kinds, as to quantity, for example much, being complicated with the three differences as to quality, I mean the hard, the soft, and the moderate as to hardness, will produce three combinations ; and, again, the tittle being joined to the other three will produce three more; and the moderate as to quality being complicated with the same three, will pro- duce three more, as is shown below : QUANTITY.

The brief but comprehensive rules of Hippocrates for the application of friction, are thus given in the language of Celsus: "Hippocrates dixit, frictione, si vehemens sit, durari corpus; si lenis, molliri; si multa, minui; si modica, impleri." Celsus adds, that, according to circumstances, the body may be braced by it, if relaxed; may be softened, if indurated; may have its superfluities expelled, if loaded with plethora; and have nourishment attracted to it, if emaciated. He remarks, that it is mostly applicable in the decline of a disease. His other directions for the application of it arc very apposite, (ii, 14.)

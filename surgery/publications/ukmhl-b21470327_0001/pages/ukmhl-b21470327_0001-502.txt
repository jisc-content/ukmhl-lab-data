CORYZA, ETC. [book III. 470 gives rise to bad coughs. And a cough often arises from an intemperament; sometimes a hot one, as in fevers, and some- times a cold, as in northerly states of the weather, which is rather a dry one. Cough is also sometimes symptomatic of some other disease, such as pleurisy, hepatitis, phthisis, or peri- pneumonia. Wherefore Galen relates that, in certain chronic cases of cough, chalazia (hail-stones) have been brought up from the chest. But Alexander relates that a certain heavy stone, like that which forms in the urinary organs, was brought up in a chronic cough, upon which the cough ceased. We ourselves have seen a discharge of stones with vomiting of blood, as we will describe more accurately when we come to that part.

The food most befitting are spoon-meats and eggs in a state to be supped, starch, sweet cake, sesame, rice, almonds, the fruit of the cones of pine, and all confections from milk. The wines which are drunk should be sweet and not old. The lohoch from poppy-heads, called diacodium, and other compound medicines for these complaints, are to be taken. When a cold intempe- rament prevails, and the disease is difficult to remove, a restricted diet is to be observed, and the head anointed with some heatino- and attenuating ointment, such as that of nard or rue.

He forbids us to administer it freely when there is obstruction or inflammation of an internal viscus ; and states many serious evils which may arise from the unsea- sonable administration of cold water, although it be an excel- lent remedy when given at the proper time.

As a specimen, however, of the practice of the later authors, we shall briefly mention that of Synesius andConstan- tinus Africanus. They approve of bleeding, unless the stomach be loaded with crudities j in which case they forbid the operation until these are concocted or discharged. They recommend dilu- ents; and, if the belly is constipated, clysters, with decoctions, con- taining tamarinds, damascenes, manna, and the like.

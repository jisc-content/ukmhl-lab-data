3fi HABIT. [BOOK t- Another abstergent composition (smegma), to be frequently rubbed into the skin : fat figs bruised with bryony, and the burned powder of tares, the shells of the cuttle-fish (sepia), mixed with a small quantity of honey. Comm. Commentary. This Section is taken from Oribasius. (Synops. v, 20.) SECT. XXV. TO MAKE THE PERSPIRATION FRAGRANT. The perspiration may be rendered fragrant by mixing the leaves of the cypress, pounded dry, and the bark of the pine in the same ointment. One ought also to remember in the morning, immediately after being dressed, to taste a small quan- tity of cassia or savin. Comm. Commentary. This is copied from Oribasius. (Synops. v, 21.) See also Rhases (ad Mansor. v, 53.) Rhases recommends the heads of cardui for food, and the seeds of juniper or cassia lignea in the drink. His advice further is to rub the body with pastils of roses, and to drink aromatic wine. SECT. XXVI. TO WARM THE HABIT. Since even the habit must be warmed, it will be proper to use a preparation of a heating nature when in the bath. Let it contain calamint, majoram (sampsuchum), hyssop, bay berries, rosemary, the stone pyrites, salts, the burnt lees of wine, nitre, pumice-stone, each in proper proportion; also a small quantity of mustard, staves-acre, and the seeds of the thymeleea (granum cnidium). After the bath, use a warm restorative (Acopum), and chink a yellow old wine, having taken a sweet drink {jiro- poma) from wine and honey, pepper, rue, and the like. Comm. Commentary. All this Section is taken from Oribasius, ex- cepting the part relating to the draught or Propoma. The nature of the Propoma will be explained in the Seventh Book. \Ve may just mention that it was a sort of liqueur.

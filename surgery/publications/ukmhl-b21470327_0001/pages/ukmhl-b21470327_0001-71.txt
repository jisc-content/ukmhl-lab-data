39 THE TEETH. SECT. XXIX. | SECT. XXVII. FOlt PALENESS. Paleness of the body is diminished by a merry course of life, and grateful food, by mixing together radishes, leeks, and the green chick-pea. The juice of the sweet pomegranate taken internally, restores the complexion. Oil, in which the root of the white vine (bryonia) has been long boiled, is likewise proper. This gives tone to the body. For detergent applications, form pastils of detergents, as farina, the bulb of the narcissus, and the root of the bryony. The root also of the bitter almond, if taken in abundance, will improve the colour, and likewise the fruit boiled in water and used for a bath. Commentary. This Section is taken from Oribasius. (Syn. Comm. v, 23.) SECT. XXVIII. ON LIVIDITY. Livid spots are prevented from forming on old men, by ren- dering their skin thick and hardy, and by warming the habit. In order to dispel them, the black places should be rubbed in the bath with salts, and fomented with sponges steeped in a decoction of radish or wormwood. Commentary. This is taken from Oribasius. (Synops. v, 24.) Com SECT. XXIX. PRESERVATIVES OF THE TEETII. The teeth will not decay if the following things be attended to : in the first place, to avoid indigestion, and frequent repe- titions of emetics. Guard against such food as is hurtful to the teeth, as dried figs, honey boiled, so as to become very hard, dates which are difficult to rub down, and all glutinous sub- stances ; likewise such things as are difficult to break, and may thereby loosen the teeth; in like manner also, such substances as set the teeth on edge, and everything which is cold and putrid. The teeth also ought to be cleaned after supper.

SECT VII0 CRITICAL DAYS. 197 The Arabians, with scarce one exception, adopt the Galenic Comm. system. Avicenna, who treats of the critical days very fullv mentions the list of them given by Hippocrates and Galen, and also that by Archigenes, but decides in favour of the former Rhases mentions the critical davs in the following terms: the 3d is critical in very acute fevers ; the 4th is indicative of the 7th and 6th; the 5th is favorable; the 6th generally un- favorable; the 7th is a particularly favorable or unfavorable crisis; the 8th rarely critical, but if it be, unfavorable; the 11th critical and indicative of the 14th; the 12th rarely cri- tical, and like the 8th; the 13th rarely critical; the 14th, critical and favorable; the 15th like the 13th; the 16th like the 12th; the 17th like the 9th, and indicative of the 20th; the 18th rarely critical, or unfavorable; the 19th rarely criti- cal, or, if so, not bad; the 20th next to the 14th, and favor- able; the 21st sometimes critical, but less frequently so than 2 oth; the 24th resemblinS the 2Â°th > after these the 27th, 31st, 37th, and 40th are critical. Averrhoes remarks, that great deference is due to Rhases' opinion upon this sub- ject, since it was confirmed by experience, in more than ten thousand cases, in an infirmary (in infirmaria Relenson). His list is very little different from that of Galen. In his ' Conti- uens/ he gives an account of the system of Archigenes, but prefers that of Hippocrates, (xxxii.) Averrhoes states that the medical world was divided between the systems of Archigenes and Galen, but he inclines to the sulc of the latter in this case, although on most occasions given to dispute his authority. Avenzoar, upon the whole, nearly agrees with Rhases, but expresses himself undecided with regard to the 20th and 21st days. His authority must also be allowed to be of great weight upon this subject, if we may believe Averrhoes, that he lived to the age of one hundred and thirty-five, and practised medicine from his fortieth year. To the first class of critical days, according to Haly Abbas, belong the 7th and 14th; to the second, the 11th and 20th; to the third, the 4th, 17th, and 21st; and to the fourth, the 3d 5th, 9th, and 18th. Alsaharavius gives a similar list to Haly's. He inclines rather to the 20th than the 21st day.

(i 13 THE MENSES. SECT. LXI.] the complaint. Suppression, he says, brings on heaviness, tor- Com por, pain of the loins, of the hindhead, of the root of the eyes, w" &c. When suppression arises from a hot temperament, it is to be treated with cooling and diluent food, such as ptisan, milk, lettuces, domestic kids and lambs, tender fishes and fowls, grapes, cucumbers, and a white watery wine. Baths of com- mon water are to be used. When connected with a cold tem- perament, the patient is of a pale leaden colour, and her urine watery.

It is to be cured by copious bleeding cither from the arm or foot, by quietude, and the use of common fomenta- tions. Restriction as to the bath and food must be enjoined. When connected with mÂ«ci#/iow, the constitution is to be recruited by suitable exercise and regimen, not neglecting pessaries and potions. When occasioned by vitiated humours, such as bile or phlegm, the body is to be purged with the proper medicines, and the parts fomented. Fragrant articles are to be mixed with the food. The pessaries are to be made of elaterium, sow-bread, or the like, if bile prevails; but of anemone, pepper, or colocynth, if phlegm. When a bleeding at the nose is the

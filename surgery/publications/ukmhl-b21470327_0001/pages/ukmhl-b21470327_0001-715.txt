THE NAILS. SECT. LXXXI.] 683 rides for leprous nails arc arsenic and water, sandarach, quick- Comm. lime, and burnt lees of wine with pitch, the juice of thapsia and mustard with vinegar, &c. See also M.-M. v, 122. For bruised nails, Aetius strongly commends a mixture of fossil salt with Water and oil. Avenzcmr speaks of privet (alcanna) with olive-oil. For bloody nails, Nonnus recommends a mixture of verdigris and axunge. Vvicenna, among other applications resembling those of the Greeks, recommends a plaster of cypress-nuts and savin. For pterygia, Celsus, among other applications, makes men- tion of a mixture of arsenic, quicklime, and chalcitis, in equal proportions. If this application fail, he directs us .to use the actual cautery. Aetius and Oribasius recommend the most powerful escharotics, such as verdigris, mis*, sori, chalcitis, and arsenic. These applications are mentioned likewise by Rhases. (Contih. xxxvi.) Pliny says of arsenic, " Tollit et pterygia digitorum," &c. (H. N. xxxiv, 56.) END OF VOL. I.

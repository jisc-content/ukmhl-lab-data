FISHES. [BOOK!- 100 We may mention here, although somewhat out of place, that neither the Greeks nor Romans would appear to have used the frog as an article of food. i SECT. XCI. ON THE TESTACEA, OR SHELL-FISH. The testacea in general form a saltish and of them the oysters have the softest flesh, and are most laxatn e^ The chema, purpura, solenes, ^\}^^J^ sneh like, are hard. And those covered with a soft shell snch as the astaci, paguri, crabs, common lobsters, andl those called squilke, are of difficult digestion, nutntio * belly when often boiled in sweet water. The j^m of ^ the testacea are laxative, and therefore from the land their flesh be hard, indigestible, nutntxous and imces, some make a sance, with oil and pickle which they use for opening the belly. The sea urchins (echim) are moderately cooling, contain little nourishment, and are diuretic. M Commentary. Coray correctly states in his 'Notes on the - Fragment of Xenocrates/ that, in the ancient classificaUon of animals, the o*rp«Kaio, or oWpaico&p/m, were divided into the «X,poarp«ic«, or testacea, comprehending oysters, muscles, &c; and the ^aXa^aKa, or Crustacea, comprehending the crabs, paguri, &c. But, as he remarks afterwards the aKWcrrpaicnwereoften called bythe genericterm,oorpaicoo£pMa. The ancient division of the lower classes of animals is derived from Aristotle's 'History of Animals' (iv), and with some slight modifications it is the same as the classification adopted by Baron Cuvier. Pliny thus distinguishes the mollusca, Crustacea, and testacea: " Piscium quidam sanguine carent, de quibiis dicemus. Sunt autem tria genera: in primis quse mollia appellantur {mollusca?): deinde contecta crustis tenmbus (Crustacea?) : postremo testis conclusa duris {testacea?). Mollia snnt, loligo, sepia, polypus, et cetera ejus generis," &c In another place, however, he introduces confusion by applying the term mollia to the Crustacea. This mistake probably ori- ginated in the resemblance between the Greek terms paXaKia and /iiuXa/cocrTpnKa. (Hist. Nat. ix.)

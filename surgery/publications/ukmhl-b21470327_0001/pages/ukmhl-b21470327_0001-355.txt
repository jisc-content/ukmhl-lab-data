When connected with excessive heat of these parts, he approves of cold air, cold drink, and refrigerant draughts, containing prunes, tamarinds, camphor, &c. (xvi, 18.) The causes of hiccough, according to Serapion, are evacuation, repletion, pungent and cold humours. His remedies are emetics, calefacients, and attenuants, which are to be directed according to the nature of the exciting cause, (iii, 17.)

In the commencement, we must not inter- fere with the discharge when it proceeds from corruption of the food and indigestion; but when the evacuation becomes immo- derate, it must be restrained. If the discharges are of an acrid nature, that which is given should consist of good juices, and be otherwise thick, such as spoon-meats from pearl-spelt (chondrus) and ptisan. Baths are also befitting after the complaint has be- come concocted. But when the discharges consist of phlegm

COMM COMM m FEVERS. [BOOK n' Galen, and most of the ancient authorities, believed that the critical davs are influenced by the moon. Actuarius m parti- cular, attributes much to the influence of the sun and moon m influencing the course of fevers. Prosper Alpinus gives a eorreet s—y of to —* trines respecting the critical days. (De pra*. Vlta et Morte segrot. vi, 4.) SECT. VIII. THAT CRITICAL SYMPTOMS APPEARING IN THE COM- MENCEMENT ARE UNFAVORABLE. The signs of concoction are never unfavorable, for concoc- tion always take place when nature prevails, and therefore the signs of it are alwavs favorable. But the critical signs may sometimes appear unfavorably, owing to the crisis partaking of a double character (as was said with regard to the critical days), being sometimes favorable and sometimes unfavorable. They ought not therefore to appear at the commencement, nor during the increase of the disease, but after its acme, at which time nature is prevailing over the disease. Commentary. The opinion here delivered is derived origi- nally from Galen, but is maintained also by Oribasius, and the other authorities. It requires no comment. SECT. IX. HOW TO JUDGE BEFOREHAND OF A FUTURE CRISIS. If the paroxysms increase in violence, occur earlier, and become much stronger; if they invade on the third day; and if symptoms of concoction appear in the urine, alvine discharges, and sputa, the disease will certainly soon come to a crisis. If the attack is slow, and if the paroxysms occur at the same hour every day, you may expect that the crisis will not take place till after a longer time. And those fevers which make their attack with rigors cannot terminate until the rigor abate; for until that occur it is impossible for the disease to have attained its acme, and therefore much less is it reasonable to expect that it is upon the decline.

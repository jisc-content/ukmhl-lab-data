t' 12 more serious is it when the issues are so momentous and far reaching as tliose embraced in medical edu(fation. We are entrusted with the pn^ical ecjucation of men who go to all quarters of the earth, wherever theTBritish name has penetrated. ' Your knowledge and skill may affecf the health and happiness of innumerable families, and any error youi imbibe here may be multipliedendless ways; yet, on the other; hand, all good and true lessons wjM .have a wide circuit for their aÂ«tion> so that the clinical teacher is, as .it were, the centre from which fee reaching waves of good or of evil may spread. It is also a most anxious duty we have to perform, as \^e must, as it were, think aloud? before an intelligent audience, anii recognise disease, foreshadow re-; suits, and direct treatment almost on the spur of the moment. If this is most trying to a teacher's reputation, there is at least a compensating gain both to himself and his patieaits, as it must needs render him most careful in his words and actions, and in this augmented attention and caution the patients secure a further guarantee for their prudent treat- ment. AH of us, whatever our experience may be, are likely to err and fail; buCTiT each strenuously endeavour to do his best, he has a right to rely on the loyal support of every true student.

33 falciform process which lies over the femoral artery, and passes inwards to attach itself to Poupart’s ligament, and to form the anterior part of Gimbernat’s ligament, does more than this ; it passes on, and is inserted also into the pubes, on a plane lower than the insertion of the inferior pillar of Poupart’s ligament, so that, in fact, it forms an arch exterior to the septum crurale, which, when it is forced to descend, is compelled to pass under it; and it is this, and not Poupart’s ligament, which causes the greatest compression on the hernia, and is the seat of external stricture. This portion of the fascia lata forms an arch in reality when a hernia is protruded underneath it; but in its natural state it is not the case; the absorbent vessels pass underneath it and through the septum near the sheath of the femoral vein; but as the falciform process of the iliac fascia lata passes on to its insertion in the pubes, it rests on, and is attached to, the pubic portion of the fascia lata. This attachment, although not a very intimate one, is sufficient to confine the part, but sometimes it is so strong just at the pubes, and forms so firm and complete a union, that drawing on one part evidently influences the other, and renders the arch a circle, through which the hernia is protruded. The anterior part, or the iliac portion of the fascia lata attached to Poupart’s ligament, being tendinous, and firmly stretched across from point to point, can yield but little; the inside, or Gimbernat’s ligament, can hardly yield at all; indeed it appears to retain its sharpness unimpaired. The sheath of the femoral vessels is scarcely displaced, and the under part, or the pubic portion of the fascia lata covering the pectinalis muscle, seems to be the only part which can easily make room for the hernia to be protruded. This it does by the separation of the attachment between it and the falciform process of the iliac fascia lata, and by the muscle beneath yielding to the pressure. The structure thus described is of great importance, in giving rise to stricture when any additional matter is forced into the hernial sac, and is much more frequently the cause of strangulation than has, I think, been hitherto supposed. When a femoral hernia has passed this point, it would descend on the inside of the thigh towards the knee, like a psoas abscess, if it were not prevented by the vessels passing from the femoral artery to the superficial fascia, which bound it below ; and from the turn which it takes upwards, from the natural and almost constant bending of the thigh. The herniary swelling, small as it is on passing under Poupart’s ligament, expands after it has passed it, turns upwards and F

31 extending from the septum on the inside of the vein to the pubes where Pou- part’s ligament is inserted by its lower pillar, and by what is called its third insertion, or Gimbernat’s ligament. This is occupied by a continuation of the fascia forming a barrier nearly at a right angle with the septum or sheath on the inside of the vein, and is perforated for the passage of the absorbents. This is called by Cloquet septum crurale, being the barrier between the abdomen and the thigh, and when weakened and forced to descend before a hernia, it is called fascia propria by Sir Astley Cooper. This same part is also called the inner and superior opening of the crural canal by the German and French anatomists; the opening through the fascia lata of the thigh which gives passage to the vena saphena to join the femoral vein, being called the inferior and exterior opening of the same canal. The French anatomists do not describe the anterior portion of the sheath of the vessels as formed by the fibrous layer of fascia transversalis which passes under Poupart’s ligament, the crural arch, or arcade crurale for this purpose ; but consider this sheath to arise from the ligament or arch, at its lower edge, and not in the manner I have noticed it; and although they describe very accurately the barrier which exists between the inside of the femoral vein and the pubes, they do not look upon it as a part of the sheath of the vessels. The septum crurale, as Cloquet calls it, and which I think the best name for this barrier, is not a straight partition, but a curved one, being concave upwards or inwards towards the abdomen, and convex towards the thigh, so that by a little management in dissection it may be made to assume a funnel-like shape on the thigh, and to lead to the conclusion that anything passing into it from within must follow the inclination which such a formation naturally gives, and of course be projected against the vein, by the side of which it would pass out at the lower opening of what the French anatomists call the crural canal; this does not however occur when a femoral hernia takes place. The inside of the septum crurale, or that part which is next the abdomen, is concave, and the oval hollow formed by it is partly filled up by an absorbent gland, which is separated from the peritoneum by the cellular layer of fascia transversalis extended across from the edges of the hollow. It is into this concave septum, oval from side to side, that the hernial sac first passes; and it is this fact has made Sir Astley Cooper say, that a hernia is protruded into the sheath of the

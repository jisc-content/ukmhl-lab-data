2 little difficulty or hesitation in attributing the cause of strangulation to a sudden or irregular contraction of these fibres : but as such fibres were not believed to exist, or were supposed only to exist on the upper part, the impossibility of any circular contraction was necessarily inferred ; and other causes of strangulation were sought for in the ingenuity of those individuals whose attention was devoted to the subject. I am quite aware, that these individuals have been and are among the number of the most celebrated anatomists and surgeons in Europe ; that any effort to add to their labours may be considered an act of supererogation; and that any attempt to differ in opinion from them will be thought, perhaps, a matter of vanity. Facts have, however, forced themselves upon me so strongly, that I could not help acknowledging their influence ; and it will be for those who doubt, to investigate this subject by their aid, and, by a similar patient inquiry, to confirm or confute the opinions I have founded upon them ; viz. that the inner or superior opening of the inguinal canal is a muscular opening, or rather split, capable of a great degree of contraction, which is usually the cause of strangulation in cases of recent hernise, and is by no means an infrequent one even in older ones. Before I was enabled to demonstrate the muscular structure of these parts, I had had the opportunity of examining the bodies of two persons who had died from strangulated hernise, in both of whom the stricture on the intestine had been so great, that a common silver probe could not be easily passed in the canal of the gut. The last case was that of a person who had been operated upon, and died shortly afterwards; the intestine had been returned into the cavity of the abdomen, and was found lying behind the inner ring, with a narrow but deep indentation around it, marking the place at which the stricture had existed, and through which a probe could only be passed by dilating the contraction. I showed the preparation at my Lecture, and declared, what I believe to be true, that this could only have taken place from some direct muscular pressure from without, and not from any congestion or dilatation from within or below the stricture. I also acknowledged that I could not show, by dissection, in what manner this contraction had taken place, or by what parts it was effected. I have always, however, continued to impress upon the minds of the gentlemen attending my Lectures for the last ten years, that the principal cause of strangulation in recent hernia was a contraction of the superior or internal opening of the inguinal canal, the cause and nature of which I could

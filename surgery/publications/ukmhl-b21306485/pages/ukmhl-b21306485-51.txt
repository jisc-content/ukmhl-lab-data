— 41 J. The femoral vein. K. The femoral artery. Fig. 2. Is taken from Plate VI. of P. F. Blandin, Traite d’Anatomie Topo- graphique, and which is supposed by him to be in accordance with the opinions entertained by those French anatomists who preceded him to 1826. A. The inferior and united edges of the internal oblique and transversalis muscles, horizontally directed across the abdomen to the linea alba. B. The crural arch, or Poupart’s ligament. C. Fibrous expansion detached from around the inguinal ring, i. e. the ring exposed by the removal of the intercolumnar fascia. D. The internal or superior pillar of the ring. E. The external or inferior pillar of the ring. F. Muscular nooses or arches formed by the cremaster muscle on the spermatic cord, and derived from the inferior border of the internal oblique and transversalis muscles. G. This is S. in the original, and is described as the aponeurotic fascia transversalis, which forms the posterior wall of the inguinal canal in a spot where, of the three muscles of the abdomen, only one is found, viz. the external oblique. This is internal to the cord. H. This is also S. in the original, and represents the same thing, but ex- ternal or to the outside of the cord. I. The spermatic cord. 1. The femoral vein situated on the inside of 2. The femoral artery. 3. An opening made in the external part of the crural canal (sheath of the vessel), to show the anterior crural nerve situated immediately on the outside of it, and lying on the cellular structure covering the psoas muscle. 4. Saphena major vein. 5. A lymphatic gland and vessels. 6. Falciform or semilunar fibres situated at the junction of the vena saphena with the femoral vein. G

EXPLANATION OF THE PLATES. * \ PLATE I. The parts concerned in Inguinal Hernia on the left side. 1.1.1. Integument. 2. Fascia superficialis. 3. External oblique muscle. 3. a. Its aponeurosis turned down on the thigh. '3.h. Poupart’s ligament. 3. c. The insertion of the external oblique into the os pubis. 4. a. The internal oblique muscle passing across the abdomen to assist in- forming the sheath of the rectus. 4. b. A portion or slip of this muscle separated from its attachment, and hanging down outside the spermatic cord. 5. The superior fibres of the transversalis muscle passing above the cord to their insertion into the pubis. 6. The inferior fibres of the transversalis muscle passing below the cord, forming the lower edge of the internal or superior opening of the inguinal canal, and inserted into Poupart’s ligament up to the pubes. The fibres marked 6 are all muscular; in some instances they are tendinous and aponeurotic; in others they are either wanting or so indistinct as scarcely to be distinguished from the fascia transversalis. 7. The cremaster muscle given off from the internal oblique, and partly from the transversalis muscles seen lying upon the cord at 7, and passing under it from 7 to 8. 8. The portion of the cremaster usually considered as a second origin, but which is in fact its insertion after its fibres have proceeded the whole length of the spermatic cord and testis, forming in this way a sling partly muscular, partly tendinous, whereby it may be drawn up towards the abdomen.

Sir Astley Cooper dissected the internal parts to show how far they accorded with the view of them given in his Work, and which is fig. 3. Poupart’s ligament. The tendon of the external -oblique, turned towards the linea alba. The spermatic cord. The cremaster muscle. The internal oblique muscle; at the upper part its anterior surface is shown, at the under part it is separated from the transversalis, a little raised and turned upwards and inwards, so as to show the under surface of the muscular fibres at E. The transversalis muscle partly exposed and raised in a similar manner; the under surface is shown by the line extending from F.; the outer surface of the same muscle is shown by the line extending from I., and which corresponds with No. 3. and 4. c. of Plate I. ; and lower down with No. 6., or the fibres passing under the cord. Fascia transversalis, outer division. Peritoneum. The inferior fibres of the transversalis.

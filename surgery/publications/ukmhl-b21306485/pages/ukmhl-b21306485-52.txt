The anterior wall of the crural canal or sheath of the vessels, opened and turned outwards and inwards to show the canal. Fig. 3. A. A. B. C.C. D. E. F. G. H. II. K. Is a copy reversed of Figure 1. of Plate V. from Sir Astley Cooper’s book on the Structure and Diseases of the Testis, showing the in- guinal canal and course of the spermatic cord. Poupart’s ligament. Internal oblique muscle. / Transversalis muscle arising from Poupart’s ligament, and passing around the spermatic cord at the internal ring, so that the fibres of this muscle appear behind as well as before the spermatic cord, and thus the inguinal canal is rendered a muscular canal: this is a most important provision in preventing hernia; and when hernia exists, it is often the cause and seat of stricture. The cremaster muscle arising from Poupart’s ligament between the internal oblique and transverse muscles, and receiving fibres from the transversalis behind the cord. The rectus muscle. Its sheath from the internal oblique and transverse muscles. Superficial fascia of the cord. Spermatic cord. The internal ring. By an oversight the line running from I. rather appears to stop at the cremaster muscle at D., than to go on to the inner ring. The external ring. N.B. The difference between F. and G. of fig. 2. when compared with F. and I. of fig. 1. is remarkable; it is no less so when compared with C. C. of fig. 3. of the same Plate, or with No. 5. and 6. of Plate I. The French anatomists generally appear to consider that formation of the transversalis muscle to he the more natural one, in which it runs across to the linea alba, without being inserted into Poupart’s ligament, when the spermatic cord will be found lying on the fibrous layer of the fascia transversalis, as in

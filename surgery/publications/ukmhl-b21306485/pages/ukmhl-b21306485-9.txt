ON SOME POINTS CONNECTED WITH THE ANATOMY AND SURGERY OF INGUINAL AND FEMORAL HERNIiE. I HAD the honour of delivering the Lectures in the Theatre of the Royal College of Surgeons, in February 1831, on the Anatomy and Surgery of Inguinal and Femoral Hernise ; and I took the liberty on that occasion to demonstrate the anatomy of some of the parts concerned in these derangements in a manner which had not been commonly adopted, but which I trust will be found more satisfactory than the method which is usually followed. A difference of opinion in regard to the structure of a part of the body is not of much real importance, unless it involves some practical point; and it is under this impression I venture to hope that the dissections made on that occasion, and the elucidations and explanations which resulted from them, have enabled me to remove a discrepancy that existed between the anatomy and surgery of these parts, which I had always pointed out in my private lectures, but was unable previously to explain. According to the prevailing opinion of modern surgeons, the parts through which an inguinal hernia passes or proceeds, have little or nothing to do with the causes of strangulation; which are supposed to depend upon certain circum- stances connected with the state of the protruded parts themselves, rather than upon any positive contraction or diminution of the size of the aperture through which they pass. If it had been generally demonstrated or believed that the inner or superior opening of the inguinal canal was a muscular opening or split, through or between the fibres of which the protrusion took place, there would have been B

CHAPTER II. AFFECTIONS OF THE SKULL. FRACTURES. Fractures of the skull vary in character and gravity according to the situation of the fracture, viz., whether it is chiefly in the vault or in the base; according to its extent; according to whether the fracture is complete, or whether only one table is injured; whether the broken pieces are de- pressed, etc.; lastly, it also varies with the instrument inflicting the injury. The effects of injuries sufficiently severe to produce a fracture of the skull are not as a rule limited to the mere fracture. Various complications ensue, some more and some less frequently; among the most important are concussion, laceration, and compression of the brain; various septic complications, such as erysipelas and cellulitis of the scalp; osteo-myelitis of the skull, lepto meningitis, cerebral abscess; paralyses of motion, sensation or special sense; hernia cerebri; subsequent mental derangements, persis- tent headaches, or traumatic epilepsy. These complications will be considered in detail later on. In the present chapter we shall simply deal with frac- tures per se. As regards situation, fractures of the skull are divided into those of the vault and those of the base. FRACTURES OF THE VAULT OF THE SKULL. These fractures are generally due to direct violence, though sometimes they are merely upward extensions of a widespread fracture of the base; the whole thickness of the skull may be involved or one table only may be broken. FRACTURE OF THE EXTERNAL TABLE ALONEâ€”In some cases, especially when the injury has been inflicted with a sharp instrument and the blow has fallen obliquely upon the skull, the outer table alone may be injured. This form of injury may also occur in situations where there is a considerable interval between the outer and inner tables, notably over the frontal sinus, or the mastoid process. The fracture most commonly

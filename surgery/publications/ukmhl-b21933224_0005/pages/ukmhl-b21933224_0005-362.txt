THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE NOSE. when the affection follows influenza, etc., the internal administration of strychnine should be tried. The liquor strychnine may be given in increasing doses of from 5-10 minims three times a day. Should this fail, quinine may be given, but commonly no beneficial effect will be obtained. PAROSMIA. Parosmia is a perversion of the sense of smell which always results in a subjective sensation of an unpleasant character. The patient comes â€¢complaining of a more or less constant and disgusting odour in the nose. In such cases the presence of a local cause, and more especially a sinus suppuration, should always be most carefully sought for. This or an ordinary severe coryza, such as accompanies influenza, is by far the most common cause. Other cases may depend upon syphilis, especially when necrosis is present, upon the presence of a foreign body, on ozaena, etc. A few cases are of cerebral origin, while in some no cause may be found. The prognosis depends upon the possibility of ascertaining and removing the cause. In cerebral cases recovery is rare. The treatment is to ascertain and remove the cause, and employ generally the treatment described above in speaking of anosmia.

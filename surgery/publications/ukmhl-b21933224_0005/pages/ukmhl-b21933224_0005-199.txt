171 CLEFT PALATE. got the patient fully under, to saturate the corner of a towel with chloroform and to take advantage of every pause in the operation to maintain the administration. If care be taken to fully anaesthetise the patient before the operation is commenced, it is comparatively easy to keep him under as long as the operation lasts. Accumulation of blood in the pharynx must be carefully watched and sponged away as soon as it becomes excessive. The assistant's duty is to maintain the gag in position and to sponge for the surgeon ; the sponging must be done very carefully so as not to Fig. 66.—Smith's Gag. bruise the delicate flaps, but at the same time the throat must be effectually cleared of blood. The mouth must be held well open with a gag and some self-retaining instrument is the most satisfactory. The one most commonly employed is Smith's (see Fig. 66), or some modification of it, Fig. 67.—Rose's Gag. provided with a tongue-plate to keep that organ out of the way. It is also fitted with rings through which a bandage can be passed behind the head so as to keep it in place. The objections to this form of gag are in the first place that the tongue-plate is apt to force the tongue back and embarrass the respiration \ this can generally be avoided by careful insertion of the gag ; the other objection is that the upper half of- the gag takes its hold behind the alveolus in the middle line and may render it difficult to work quite at the anterior part of the cleft. When these difficulties are met with, Mason's gag, or Rose's modification of it (see Fig. 67), or

THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE HEAD. 46 cavity after the bone has been divided (see Fig. 7). It should be remembered that in this situation the bone is usually very thin; if, how- ever, the diagnosis be correct, there will be little risk to the dura, which is widely separated from the bone by the clot. The operation of tre- phining has been already fully described (see p. 22). The circle of bone removed should be placed temporarily beneath the scalp (see p. 24) in case it should be required afterwards. As a rule the clot is at once exposed and bulges into the opening, but Fig. 12.—Method of Securing a Ruptured Middle Meningeal Artery in the Dura Mater The trephine hole is seen above exposing the clot. The bone has been rapidly removed in the downward direction by Hoffman's forceps and the bleeding point thus exposed. This is seized in catch forceps and the vessel under-run above and below. The upper thread is seen in place, the lower one is being inserted. does not usually pulsate; should it do so, it generally means that free haemorrhage is going on, the pulsation being communicated not from the brain but from the open end of the torn artery. The clot should now be gently removed with a blunt scoop or an egg-spoon, and any debris can be flushed out with a weak solution of sublimate (1-8000) at about the body temperature. Care should be taken that the irrigation is not applied under pressure, as otherwise it might detach the dura still further; the escape of the fluid must be perfectly free. Should the torn vessel not be sufficiently exposed—which usually means that the rupture is lower down— portions of the skull should be rapidly cut away downwards in the course

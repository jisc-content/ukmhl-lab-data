SUPPURATION IN ANTRUM AND MASTOID CELLS. 405 the meatus being freely detached (see Fig. 139, A). All bleeding points should now be clamped and the general oozing arrested by sponge pressure. The bared bone should be carefully searched with a probe to ascertain the existence of a sinus. If one be found, the probe should be passed in to Fig. 139.â€”The Complete Post-Aural Operation on the Mastoid. A. Shows the incision and the auricle displaced forwards to expose the external meatus, a. Outline of mastoid process ; anterior limit of lateral sinus ; e, centre of antrum, the dotted line round this shows the area of bone to he removed ; if, supra-meatal spine ; c, handle of malleus. /?. Shows the antrum opened and its outer wall removed, a, Antrum ; />, bridge of bone between antrum and external meatus. C. Shows the aditus exposed by removal of the bridge of bone, a, Antrum; /', malleus. D. Operation completed by removal of the outer wall of the attic, the membrane, and the ossicles, a, Antrum ; i, aqueductus Fallopii containing the facial nerve. ascertain its direction, and it should then be enlarged by means of a gouge or sharp spoon. It will almost invariably be found to lead into the antrum. Should no sinus be found, the next step of the operation is to lay open the antrum. This cavity lies on a level with the superior margin of the auditory

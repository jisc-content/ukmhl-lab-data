CHAPTER XXIX. CHRONIC INFECTIVE DISEASES OF THE NOSE. SYPHILIS: TUBERCLE: LUPUS: LEPROSY: RHINOSCLEROMA. SYPHILIS OF THE NOSE. PRIMARY SYPHILIS.—In a few extremely rare cases a chancre has been seen in the anterior part of the nose, usually on the septum. It may be produced by picking at the nose with infected fingers, or by using an infected Eustachian catheter, etc. The sub-maxillary glands on the same side are always enlarged and corroborative evidence will subsequently appear. SECONDARY SYPHILIS.—This affection rarely gives rise to any characteristic signs in the nose, but a chronic, obstinate form of rhinitis associated with marked congestion of the nasal mucous membrane is not infrequently seen accompanying the ordinary signs of secondary syphilis. Mucous patches and condylomata are practically never met with in the nose. The treatment of these two conditions is that of syphilis in general (see Part I. p. 230) and no special treatment beyond ordinary measures for cleansing the nose is required for the local manifestations. TERTIARY SYPHILIS.—Tertiary syphilis of the nose is not un- common and may appear at a very early or a very late stage of the disease. It may assume the form of a gumma or of a gummatous infil- tration. A gumma is most commonly observed on the anterior part of the septum, at first as a diffuse swelling, but later on appearing more localised and prominent and closely resembling an abscess. More usually, when the case comes under observation the gumma has broken down and a large ulcerating surface is seen. This is accompanied by considerable swelling of the mucous membrane and red fleshy granulations, which may entirely block the affected nostril and conceal the ulcer from view. There is also a copious purulent foetid discharge. The soft parts are first involved, but the affection commonly extends

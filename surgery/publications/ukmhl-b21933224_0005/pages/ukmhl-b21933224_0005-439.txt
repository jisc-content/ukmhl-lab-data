CHAPTER XXXVII. AFFECTIONS OF THE INTERNAL EAR AND PERCEPTIVE APPARATUS OF HEARING. The most prominent symptoms of labyrinthine affections are the diminished hearing by bone conduction, the marked lowering of the upper tone limit with comparatively slight interference with the lower notes, while extraneous sounds greatly interfere with the hearing power for conversation. In recent and acute cases other symptoms known as Meniere's group of symptoms are present and probably depend upon interference with the semicircular canals. These are vertigo, with rotatory sensations and consequent stagger- ing and reeling on attempting to walk, a tendency to fall towards the affected side, severe tinnitus, nausea and vomiting. The variety of the rotatory symptoms and the consequent movements depend upon which of the semicircular canals is affected. When complete loss of hearing is present it is impossible to decide definitely if the labyrinth or the auditory nerve or centres are involved, except by the previous history and by the concurrent symptoms which the patient presents. As but little is definitely known of the pathology of these affections, and as in the majority of them very little benefit is obtained from treatment, they will be very briefly dealt with. AFFECTIONS OF THE INTERNAL EAR. 1. Hyparosmia and pressure on the labyrinthine fluid.â€”A foreign body, a plug of wax, etc., may press upon the membrana tympani and this pressure may be transmitted through the ossicles to the fluid in the labyrinth and be more than the normal bulging of the fenestra rotunda can relieve, especially if the latter be thickened. In cases of catarrh of the middle ear adhesions may force back the ossicles on to the stapedial plate and thus produce pressure in the labyrinth which is increased by the fibrous thickening of the membranes closing the fenestra?. Syringing, especially if force be used and a large perforation be present, may pro-

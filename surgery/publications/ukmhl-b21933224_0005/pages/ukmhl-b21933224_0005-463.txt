CHAPTER XL. TUMOURS OF THE LARYNX. BENIGN TUMOURS. PAPILLOMA.—This is the most common of all. There may be a single small growth, or large cauliflower-like masses may almost fill the larynx. They may grow from any part but are especially common on the vocal cords, the ventricular bands and the parts below. Their structure is that of the ordinary branching papilloma. FIBROMATA come next in order of frequency; they form 8 to 10% of benign laryngeal growths and almost always occur in adults. They are usually single, pedunculated growths of smooth outline. CYSTS are most commonly seen on the glossal surface of the epiglottis and especially the glosso-epiglottic ligament. They form smooth, roundish, semi-translucent swellings, which yield on puncture a glairy mucous fluid. They result from obstruction to the duct of a mucous gland with consequent distension of its alveolus. MYXOMA is extremely rare ; it forms a bright pink transparent-looking growth with a smooth surface and usually springs from a vocal cord. ANGIOMATA, also excessively rare, may occur in any part of the larynx. Occasionally they give rise to severe and repeated hemorrhages. CHONDROMA.—This rare growth usually springs from the inner side of one of the laryngeal cartilages, and slowly pressing inwards may almost entirely fill the larynx. LIPOMA may occur as a pedunculated tumour attached to the epi- glottis. Symptoms.—The symptoms caused by the benign growths depend entirely upon their position and size; if in the region of the vocal cords, alteration in voice is early noticed, and, if multiple or large, dyspnoea will occur. Occasionally paroxysms of dyspnoea are met with, apparently from a pedunculated growth suddenly changing its position and exciting laryngeal spasm. The tumours should be examined by the probe so as to ascertain exactly their size, density and place of origin which is frequently deceptive

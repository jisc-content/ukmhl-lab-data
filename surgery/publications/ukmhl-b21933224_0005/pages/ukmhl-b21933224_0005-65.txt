AFFECTIONS OF THE SKULL. 37 At the same time it must be remembered that the operation is a purely temporary expedient ; it is merely employed to relieve the symptoms, and does not in any way lead to a cure of the disease. NEW GROWTHS OF THE SKULL. Tumours of the various types which are met with in other bones occur in connection with the skull. EXOSTOSES.—Among the commonest tumours of the skull are pro- bably exostoses, of the hard or ivory form. They occur chiefly on the Ki<;. 9—Exostoses of the Skull. A shows the ordinary form of the ivory exostosis aflecting the outer table only; the thick black line a represents the incision in the skull necessary for its removal. This may be made with a gouge, a parting tool, or a circular saw. If the growth be small enough, the circle may be made with a trephine. B is the same form of growth springing from the inner table, while in C the growth (usually spongy) affects the entire thickness of the bone. frontal bone, or in the bony auditory meatus. Usually they grow from the external table of the bone and do not give rise to any symptoms; sometimes, however, they may arise in the neighbourhood of the orbit and may cause serious pressure on the optic nerve. If the exostosis be in the external auditory meatus, the latter may be blocked and hearing seriously interfered with. Treatment.—These ivory exostoses grow very slowly, and, as a rule, unless they are causing deformity or pressure symptoms, they need not be interfered with. Their removal is very difficult and not altogether free from risk owing to the extreme density of the growth. Any attempt to chisel away the mass—as is done in spongy exostosis—requires a force that may cause serious jarring of the brain and possibly also fracture of the skull.

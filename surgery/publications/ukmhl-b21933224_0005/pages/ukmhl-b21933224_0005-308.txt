28o THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE NOSE. retractor are necessary. The mirror should be about a quarter of an inch in diameter and inclined at an angle of 60° to 8o° to its handle. Fraenkel's adjustable mirror is also frequently used. The most generally useful tongue depressor is that shown in Fig. 103 ; it is simple, easily cleansed, and very comfortable to the patient. Fig. 103.—Lack's Tongue Depressor. The curved end is for laryngoscopy in children : the plain one is used as an ordinary spatula. The right-hand figure shows how the instrument is used. The method is as follows: The tongue depressor, held by the thumb and two or three fingers of the left hand, is passed well back on to the centre of the tongue, whilst the mouth is opened to about half its full extent. The second or third finger of the sur- geon's left hand is placed under the patient's chin, which is pulled well for- ward, and the tongue is pressed down- wards and forwards well out of the way of the uvula without causing distress to the patient (see Fig. 103). A strong light being thrown on to the posterior wall of the pharynx, the small mirror is introduced with its fiat metal surface towards the tongue, and carefully passed backwards into the post-nasal space, great care being taken to avoid touching the uvula or the soft palate. By turning the mirror in various directions, the whole of the post-nasal space can be examined seriatim. The objects to be inspected are the posterior end of the septum, the posterior ends of Fig. 104.—The Poet-Nasal Space as seen by Posterior Rhinoscopy, a, uvula; i, in- ferior turbinate ; c, middle turbinate ; d, superior turbinate ; e, septum ; /, Eustachian tube.

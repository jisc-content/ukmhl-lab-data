THE ANATOMY OF THE NOSE. 271 first year it gradually increases in size, attaining its full development at about the twelfth year. Fig. 94.—A Semi-diagrammatic Figure showing Asymmetry of the Antral Cavities, a. Normal antrum ; b. extremely small antrum which it would be im- possible to puncture from the alveolar process and extremely difficult to do so from the inferior meatus. The frontal sinus is formed chiefly in the frontal bone and consists of a vertical portion extending upwards on to the forehead, and a horizontal portion passing backwards over the roof of the orbit (see Figs. 89, 90, 95). The sinus varies very much in size. It may extend outwards as far as Fig. 95.—The Relations of the Ethmoidal Cells and the Maxillary Antrum to the Surface. A skull from which the anterior walls of the frontal sinuses, part of the roof and outer wall of the orbit, and the outer walls of some of the ethmoidal cells and the maxillary antrum have been removed, a. The maxillary antrum ; b. nasal fossa:; c. middle ethmoidal cells ; d. frontal sinus. the external angle of the orbit, while the orbital portion may extend back- wards to the sphenoid bone, and the vertical portion upwards for an inch to an inch and a half or even more. In other cases both sinuses may be absent, or one sinus alone may be present. It is however very rare for the orbital portion of the sinus to be entirely missing, but the vertical part of it is absent in about 12% of cases. There are no reliable external

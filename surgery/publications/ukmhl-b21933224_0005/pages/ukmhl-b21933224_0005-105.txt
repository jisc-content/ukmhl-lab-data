CHAPTER VI. MENINGOCELE AND ENCEPHALOCELE: MICROCEPHALICS: HYDROCEPHALUS. MENINGOCELE AND ENCEPHALOCELE. These congenital deformities are not uncommon. The protrusion may consist of the meninges alone, containing cerebro-spinal fluid—in which case it is termed a meningocele—or it may contain brain substance as well—in which case it is known as an encephalocele. Its most frequent situations are the middle line of the skull, in the occipital region, and at the root of the nose. The tumour may also project through the base of the skull into the naso-pharyngeal cavity between the ethmoid and the sphenoid. The diagnosis is usually comparatively easy. The tumour may vary in size with respiration, and there is in addition marked cerebral pulsation when brain substance is present. The protrusion is generally partially reducible, but attempts at reduction often give rise to signs of irritation of the brain. The opening in the skull can often be felt. The prognosis is usually unfavourable. The tumour may vary in size from quite a small swelling to one involving the greater part of the cranial contents. The latter cases are especially unfavourable, and the children seldom survive more than a few days or weeks. Treatment.—This practically follows the same lines as that of spina bifida, but it can seldom be carried out to the same extent. In large tumours and those containing much brain substance, palliative treatment with the view of avoiding ulceration and spontaneous rupture of the sac will generally be found best; this consists in protecting the tumour with a suitable shield, as already described in connection with spina bifida (see Part IV., p. 297), and in the use of antiseptic ointments where the skin is abraded. Many forms of radical treatment have been attempted, but as a rule without success. Except in small tumours, it is better to leave the case

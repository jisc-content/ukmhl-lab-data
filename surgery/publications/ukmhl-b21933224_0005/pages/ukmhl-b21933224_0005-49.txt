AFFECTIONS OF THE SKULL. 21 the sharp edges may lacerate the dura mater; they should be removed very gently, and drawn out as nearly as possible parallel to the level of the skull (see Fig. 4). This point is also specially important in cases of Fig. 4.—Method of Removing a Depressed Fragment of the Skull in a De- pressed Fracture. A large flap has been turned down and a half-circle of the sound skull has been removed with a trephine. Through the aperture thus made the blade of a pair of forceps is introduced beneath the depressed fragment, which is then removed, the forceps being kept flat against the skull during the removal. In the case depicted above it was necessary to cut away some of the sound skull above the fragment with Hoffman's forceps in order to allow of extraction. gutter fracture where, if the dura mater be not actually torn, fragments of the internal table are generally sticking into its outer surface. Forceps suitable for this purpose are shown in Fig. 5. Should sufficient space not be obtained by the removal of the com- minuted fragments, it is usually quite easy with a pair of Hoffman's Fir,. 5.—Forceps for Elevating Depressed Portions of the Skull. The blades are flattened and powerful; the teeth are directed backwards so as to ensure a good grip on the bone and to prevent slipping. forceps (see Fig. 6) to punch out further portions of the bone so as to give enough room. It must be remembered that the chief object of the operation is to raise all the depressed bone and to remove any sharp edges of the internal table which may be projecting against the dura mater, and therefore sufficient space must be obtained to make sure that this object has been attained before the wound is stitched up. When the fracture is not compound, the loose fragments of the bone removed and the por-

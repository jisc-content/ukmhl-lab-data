257 LARYNGOTOMY. LARYNGOTOMY. When the air passages must be opened with the least possible delay for impending asphyxia not due to diphtheria, the most rapid plan is to perform a laryngotomy. The steps of this operation have already been fully described (see p. 234). If circumstances demand it, the operation can be done in a few seconds by plunging a knife transversely through the skin over the crico-thyroid membrane and passing along it the blades of a pair of dressing forceps, or, where these are not at hand, a hairpin, before it is removed. The after-treatment of the case will of course depend on the cause of the obstruction. When it is necessary to employ a tube permanently it is better to perform a high tracheotomy and allow the laryngotomy wound to close. pt. v. R

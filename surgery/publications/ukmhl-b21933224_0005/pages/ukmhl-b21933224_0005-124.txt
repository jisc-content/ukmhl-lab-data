SECTION II.—AFFECTIONS OF THE FACE. CHAPTER VIII. WOUNDS, INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS, ULCERS AND NEW GROWTHS OF THE FACE. WOUNDS OF THE FACE. The only special points in connection with wounds in this situation are the aesthetic considerations involved in the question of scarring, and also the possibility of injury to the various important structures about the face, of which the chief are the facial nerve and Stenson's duct. Wounds of the face heal with remarkable rapidity and are therefore less prone to septic complications than are those in many other parts of the body; the resulting scar is also much less unsightly than might be anticipated. At the same time, however, these wounds are specially liable to become attacked by erysipelas, which may spread to the scalp and may lead to the most serious complications from thrombosis of the diploic veins or the cerebral sinuses. Treatment.—The chief point to be considered, apart from risk of infection common to all wounds accidentally inflicted, is the cosmetic result, and, with this end in view, the greatest care must be taken to remove any dirt that may have gained access to the wound and which might therefore cause suppuration and unsightly scarring; in the second place it is important to reduce stitch-marks to a minimum. Under certain circumstances, even more care must be taken in the primary cleansing of the wound than is necessary for the mere avoidance of sepsis. Wounds on the face are not uncommonly caused by falls upon metallic or other substances which may be ground into the tissues and cause discoloration or tattooing of the parts. In some cases this may be so marked that it is necessary to excise the discoloured scar in order to get rid of the disfigurement. Hence under all circumstances the greatest care

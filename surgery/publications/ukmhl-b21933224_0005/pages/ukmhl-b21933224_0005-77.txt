49 INTRA-CRANIAL INJURIES. Haemorrhage from the vessels of the pia mater.—In some cases the pia mater may be lacerated and haemorrhage then takes place upon the surface of the brain, into its substance or between the convolutions. Usually a force sufficient to tear the pia mater also lacerates the brain, so that the case is one of laceration of the brain with haemorrhage on the surface, and consequently the symptoms are those of concussion and lacera- tion of the brain followed afterwards by slight symptoms of compression. The compression symptoms are not so severe as those produced by haemorr- hage from an artery such as the middle meningeal and they are more localised owing to the damage being confined to a portion of the cortex. Fig. 14.—Incision ok the Dura Mater for Sub-durai. Hemorrhage. A small nick is first made in the dura with a knife and one blade of a pair of fine blunt-pointed scissors is inserted in it. The figure shows the clot exposed by opening the dura. The incision in the latter is indicated by the dotted line. It should be about { inch from the bony margin of the aperture. Treatment.—The question of operation is determined by the amount of compression. If there, be distinct evidence of pressure upon a particular centre, even though there be no general symptoms of compression, it is well to open the skull over that point and remove the clot. If left, the pressure of the clot may cause softening of the brain beneath and per- manent damage; or the clot may be imperfectly absorbed, when a blood- cyst is produced, leading to permanent pressure on the brain; or, finally, the organisation of the clot may cause adhesions between the membranes leading to violent headaches, epileptiform convulsions, or mental derange- ment. After removing the bone and dividing the dura mater, the clot should be removed by gentle irrigation with warm salt solution (see p. 29). Any pt. v. D

31 AFFECTIONS OF THE SKULL. chisel and the diploe' exposed without using any force. The latter should then be thoroughly gouged out wherever it is found infiltrated with pus or reddened by inflammation; should the first trephining not expose the whole of the inflamed area, as is highly probable, there should be no hesitation in enlarging it and stripping off the requisite amount of the external table, even if it involves exposure of an entire bone. After all the in- fected diploe has been removed, undiluted carbolic acid is applied freely to « Fig. 8.—Removal of the Diploe in Acute Osteo-Myehtis of the Skull. The wound has been enlarged and the soft parts fully retracted. The outer table has been cut away, partly with a trephine and partly with a gouge. The diploe has also been freely gouged away, and in the centre is seen the trephine hole through the internal table for the purpose of inspecting the condition of the dura mater. the exposed bone surface as in a compound fracture; this is also applied to the whole wound after scraping away the granulations on the surface. It is well at the centre of the inflammatory area to remove a circle of the inner table, taking great care not to injure the dura mater (see Fig. 8); the object of this is to sue whether there "is suppuration between the dura and the bone. If the former be healthy, it should not be stripped away from the bone, but the wound should be closed, after providing efficient drainage. When, however, pus is found beneath the bone, or when the dura mater is affected, the whole of the skull superficial to the affected area should be cut away with Hoffman's forceps. In bad cases the wound

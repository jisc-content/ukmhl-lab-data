401 AFFECTIONS OF THE MIDDLE EAR. attempt to divide adhesions, by which also temporary good results may be obtained, but relapse is almost invariable. When firm adhesions exist around the foot-plate of the stapes, numerous operations have been devised to secure the mobility of this ossicle. These consist essentially in removing as much of the fibrous tissue as can be cut away, and subsequently in making radiating incisions around the foot- plate. Then, by means of a small pledget of wool on a probe, attempts are made to move the ossicle by pressing its head first in one direction and then in another. These procedures, as well as removal of the ossicle, often give slight temporary relief, but are invariably followed by relapse and no permanent good is effected. pt. v.

CHAPTER XVII. INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS OF THE JAWS. Inflammation of the gums and jaws is most commonly associated with caries of the teeth. It may also occur from the accumulation of tartar around the neck of the teeth, from the action of drugs, such as mercury or phosphorus, from septic infections, aphthous condition of the mouth, etc., or in connection with specific infective diseases, such as syphilis, tubercle or actinomycosis; it may also be associated with digestive troubles. The inflammation may be limited to the alveolar process or may affect the body of the jaw; it may commence in the periosteum and lead to thickening of it or it may begin in the substance of the bone and lead to alveolar abscess, or to necrosis. GINGIVITIS. In inflammation of the gums from excessive administration of mercury, the treatment is to stop the administration of the drug at once, to employ anti- septic mouth-washes, and to administer chlorate of potash (ten-grain doses three or four times a day). Chlorate of potash (grs. x. ad Â§i) also forms a very excellent mouth-wash; if some of it be swallowed it will be all the better for the patient. An aphthous condition of the mouth is also not uncommonly accompanied by a similar affection of the gums and the treatment is very simple; it consists in free purgation, and the employment of antiseptics, such as boro- glycende, etc. In secondary syphilis there is also ulceration of the gums following the formation of mucous patches upon them. The treatment is simply the treatment of secondary syphilis (see Part I., p. 231). PYORRHOEA ALVEOLARIS. The most interesting of these inflammations of the gums is that known as pyorrhcea alveolaris j it often escapes recognition or is mistaken for ulcerated

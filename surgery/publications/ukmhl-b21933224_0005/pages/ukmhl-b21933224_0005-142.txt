CHAPTER X. AFFECTIONS OF THE LIPS. WOUNDS OF THE LIPS. There are few points of special interest in connection with wounds of the lips. As in the rest of the face, healing is rapid and satisfactory. Treatment.—When a wound extends through the whole thickness of the lip, the greatest care must be taken in bringing the edges together to see that the red line is on the same horizontal level throughout. The sutures used for the skin should be of fine horsehair, whilst in the red portion of the lip fine catgut may be employed, and it is well to suture the whole of the wound on the mucous surface with the same material. No dressing is really required; at most a thin layer of salicylic wool fastened on by collodion. The discharge rapidly dries up and a scab is formed, under which healing takes place quite readily. When there has been much loss of substance of the lip some form of plastic operation will be necessary (see Chap. XII.). INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS OF THE LIPS. There is little of importance to say concerning these affections. Gangrene of the lips which sometimes occurs is usually the result of cancrum oris, a disease already described (see Part L, p. 80). CRACKS AND FISSURES OF THE LIPS are not uncommon in cold weather and are sometimes troublesome as sources of septic infection, whilst they also cause guat inconvenience to the patient from their con- stant liability to be torn open. Treatment.—If the lips be kept well anointed with glycerine, and a little goldbeater's skin be applied over the crack to protect it from cold and from irritants, the affection will usually heal. HYPERTROPHY OF THE LIPS.—In weakly children of the tuberculous type very marked thickening and overgrowth of the lips,

458 THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE LARYNX. special care to avoid all risk of colds or respiratory troubles. Tracheotomy should only be performed when absolutely necessary to avoid asphyxia. CONGENITAL WEB OF THE LARYNX. This malformation usually takes the form of a web at or just below the free edges of the vocal cords. If small it exists only anteriorly and gives rise to aphonia; a larger web extends further back between the cords and then may cause dyspnoea. Treatment.â€”Removal of the web may usually be accomplished by means of the laryngeal forceps as it is commonly very thin. Occasionally the application of the galvano-cautery may be cautiously tried. In rare cases it may be necessary to perform tracheotomy and subsequently thyrotomy and to excise the web. The after-treatment is similar to that for strictures of the larynx (see p. 444), but the results are usually satisfactory.

396 THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE EAR. be subject to repeated attacks of pain, headache and increased deafness. These attacks indicate that the discharge is locked up in a cavity in the attic, and if free exit for it is not obtained danger will result. The most reliable treatment in such cases is complete removal of the membrane and larger ossicles, and the necessity for this is commonly emphasised by the fact that the bones themselves are necrosed or carious. The malleus or incus alone may be removed, but the complete operation gives better results. Operation.—A general anaesthetic is always to be preferred. The instru- ments required are a small probe-pointed knife, a pair of fine forceps, a Delstanche's hook, an incus hook and an attic curette (see Figs. 136-138). The meatus having been cleansed by syringing and dried, an incision is made all round the periphery of the drum. It is best to commence the incision in Fig. 138.—Set of Minor Ear Instruments. From above downwards the instruments are, an aural curette, probe-pointed knife, sharp spoon, myringotome, probe, and hook. These all fit in the one handle. Shrapnell's membrane and to divide the posterior part of the drum first and then to reverse the knife and divide the anterior folds. The malleus and membrane should now be seized and extracted with forceps. When the membrane is destroyed and the malleus is adherent to the promontory, the best plan is to pass a Delstanche's hook over the handle of the malleus up to the short process, when by gentle traction the bone can be easily removed. Any bleeding should be arrested by mopping with pledgets of cotton-wool. Then the attic curette is passed well up into the roof of the tympanum and gently swept round, by which means the incus will usually be brought away.

SECTION III.—AFFECTIONS OF THE LARYNX. CHAPTER XXXVIII. GENERAL METHODS OF EXAMINATION AND TREATMENT. METHODS OF EXAMINATION. Laryngoscopy in adults.—The illuminants applicable have already been described (see p. 276), and the position of the patient, of the surgeon, and of the light are well shown in Fig. 140. The patient sits upright, with the head slightly inclined backwards, the mouth widely open, and the tongue protruded. The surgeon holds the tongue between his thumb and middle finger in a small cloth, whilst the index finger is rested upon the upper lip to keep back the moustache, etc. The patient should on no account pull against the surgeon, or the tongue is extremely likely to be cut against the front teeth. Also, the tongue should be pulled upwards rather than downwards, so as to prevent arching of the dorsum. The patient is asked to breathe rapidly and noisily, in and out, so as to raise the soft palate. The laryngeal mirror is warmed and introduced into the back of the pharynx, with the glass surface parallel with the tongue, and placed immediately below the uvula. It is then raised slightly so as to lift up the uvula, and slowly rotated until the larynx comes into view. In most cases the epiglottis, arytenoids, and parts of the interior of the larynx can be seen readily, but in order to examine the anterior parts of the vocal cords and to raise the epiglottis, if it overhang and obstruct the view of the interior of the larynx, it is necessary to make the patient phonate while the mirror is in position. The production of the sound " Ah " usually brings the posterior ends of the cords into view; " Eh" exposes the greater part of the larynx, but if the epiglottis be very pendulous and the anterior ends of the cords are not yet visible, the patient should be made to say " Ee," which raises the epiglottis to its utmost extent. These acts of phonation are also necessary to ascertain the mobility of the parts. PT. V. 2D

If, after a trial of these remedies for three or four weeks, no improvement be found, the probability is that the disease is not syphilitic or, if it be syphilitic, that it is not likely to benefit by anti-syphilitic treat- Fig. 21.—The Relations ok the various Cranial Sutures, Cerebral Convolu- tions, and Cortical Centres. The line AB denotes the main direction of the fissure of Rolando, and is obtained in the following manner. The asterisk * marks the bregma or central point of the line joining the glabella and the external occipital protuberance. A point A is then marked on the scalp 5 centimetres behind this spot, and corresponds to the upper end of the fissure of Rolando. The lower end of the fissure B is situated " 1 inch behind the point C, which is the bifurcation of the Sylvian fissure, and is 2 inches behind and \ inch above the external angular process of the frontal.

Operative.—In the early days of localisation and brain surgery great hopes were placed on surgical procedures for dealing with these cerebral tumours. These hopes, however, have not been realised to the extent that one could wish, as unfortunately the great majority of tumours of the brain are not amenable to surgical treatment. In fact, it has been found

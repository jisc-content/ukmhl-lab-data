SECTION II.—AFFECTIONS OF THE EAR. CHAPTER XXXIII. GENERAL METHODS OF EXAMINATION AND TREATMENT. In this chapter will be considered the methods of examining by illumination the accessible parts of the ear, namely the external auditory meatus, the membrana tympani and the pharyngeal ends of the Eustachian tubes; the means of determining the mobility of the drum and the patency of the Eustachian tubes : and the tests employed to ascertain the existence and variety of any defect in the hearing power. The complete examination of the ear requires also a thorough investigation of the condition of the Nose and Throat and of the general health, and a complete clinical history of the patient. Examination.—The best sources of illumination have been already described in the chapter on the examination of the nose (see p. 276). For reflecting the light into the meatus the ordinary frontal mirror (see p. 277) may be employed, but some surgeons prefer a hand-mirror with a short focal distance of five or six inches. This latter is only of use for purposes of examination and cannot be used in operating. To examine the inner part of the external auditory meatus and the drum it is convenient to employ a speculum such as Dalby's or Gruber's (see Figs. 129 and 130), the former being especially useful in operative work: those made of metal Fig. 129.—Dalby's Aural Speculum. Fig. 130.—Gkuber's Aural Speculum.

CHAPTER XXII. FOREIGN BODIES IN THE AIR PASSAGES. Foreign bodies may cause either dyspnoea or actual asphyxia, whether they lodge in the pharynx about the upper aperture of the larynx, or whether they enter , the air passages proper. FOREIGN BODIES IN THE PHARYNX. Foreign bodies lodging in the pharynx must of course be of large size, and usually consist of masses of food either swallowed or vomited, tooth- plates, etc. These interfere with respiration mechanically and a sudden and fatal asphyxia may result unless prompt and effectual treatment be adopted. Treatment.â€”In all cases in which the patient is suddenly attacked by asphyxia, either during eating or after vomiting, the first thing is to force open the jaws ; this may be done, if no gag be at hand, by introducing the handle of a knife, a spoon, or any other convenient article, between the teeth and levering the jaws apart. The finger is then pushed well back into the pharynx and swept round the orifice of the larynx in search of the foreign body causing the obstruction. If the foreign body be outside the air passages proper, it can generally either be pulled up with the finger or pushed down into the oesophagus. When the source of obstruction is a tooth-plate, however, it may not be easy to dislodge it, and in that case recourse must be had to immediate laryngotomy (see p. 234) to save the patient's life. After that has been done and a tube introduced, further efforts should be made at once to remove the foreign body. As a rule the patient will begin to breathe directly the laryngotomy is done, but when this is not the case, artificial respiration should be commenced and the surgeon should then proceed to extract the foreign body. This should be done with forceps bent at a right angle and guided by a frontal

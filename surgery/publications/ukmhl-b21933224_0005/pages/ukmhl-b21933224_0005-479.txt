CHAPTER XLIII. NEUROSES OF THE LARYNX: MALFORMATIONS OF THE LARYNX. ALTERATIONS OF SENSATION. Ancesthesia of the larynx is most common in bulbar paralysis or other affections of the medulla, in diphtheritic paralysis and in hysteria. The whole larynx may be insensitive, or the anaesthesia may be unilateral. The great danger of the affection arises from septic bronchitis and pneumonia due to food, etc., entering the wind-pipe during swallowing. Hyperesthesia, neuralgia, etc., are most commonly seen in hysterical patients, in those who habitually overstrain the voice, and as a sequel to inflammatory affections. Treatment.â€”In ancesthesia of the larynx careful attention must be directed towards the feeding of the patient and if necessary this must be clone with an oesophageal tube, which must be carefully guided over the larynx with the finger. The patient should always be made to phonate when the tube is in position so as to make sure that it has not entered the trachea. When the affection is unilateral, the patient may be taught to drink whilst lying upon the sound side with the head low, or the prone position (see p. 449) may be adopted. In cases due to diphtheria, tonics, especially strychnine, should be ninistcred together with the usual treatment of diphtheritic paralysis. Later, electricity, both the galvanic and Faradic currents, may be applied, first externally along the course of the superior laryngeal nerves and subse- quently by means of the intra-laryngeal electrode. In hysterical cases this treatment by electricity should be combined with general anti-hysterical remedies. These cases usually recover in time." The treatment for hyperesthesia, etc., must be chiefly constitutional, change of air and tonics being especially advisable. In addition the larynx should be painted at least twice a week with strong astringents as for chronic laryngitis (see p. 428) and if this fails electricity should be used.

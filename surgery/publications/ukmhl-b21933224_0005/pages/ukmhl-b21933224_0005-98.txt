CHAPTER V. HERNIA CEREBRI: TUBERCULOUS MENINGITIS: SINUS THROMBOSIS. HERNIA CEREBRI. As a result of various operations, injuries, and inflammatory processes in connection with the brain, we occasionally meet with this condition which, in its simplest significance, means a protrusion of cerebral substance through an aperture in the skull produced by injury or disease; it is thus differentiated from encephalocele, in which the protrusion takes place through an aperture resulting from a congenital malformation. Hernia cerebri is met with under two conditions: in the first place, the pro- trusion may occur immediately or very shortly after the injury or the operation,—in which case it is spoken of as a primary hernia cerebri; in other cases it may not occur until some days after the skull has been opened—when it is spoken of as a secondary hernia. It may follow trephining, compound fractures, or destruction of the cranial bones by syphilitic or tuberculous disease. PRIMARY HERNIA CEREBRI—This condition may follow after an operation or an injury in which a portion of the bone has been lost and the dura mater has been opened; such, for example, are operations for tumour, operations for the removal of blood-clot, compound fractures, etc. The healthy brain substance protrudes through the opening in the skull as the result either of a certain amount of oedema of the brain— which may happen when there has been a sudden relief of pressure after the removal of a blood-clot,—or of an unrelieved intra-cranial pressure- as after an operation for irremoveable tumour of the brain; in this case the protrusion is practically immediate. A primary hernia cerebri following an operation in which the cause of compression has been removed does not lead to any serious trouble. If the opening in the dura mater be large and the flap of skin has been replaced and completely sutured, the cedematous condition of the brain

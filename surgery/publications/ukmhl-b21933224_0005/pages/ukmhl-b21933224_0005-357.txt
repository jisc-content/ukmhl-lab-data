CHAPTER XXX. NASAL NEUROSES. HAY FEVER: PAROXYSMAL SNEEZING: RHINORRHCEA: NASAL ASTHMA: PAROSMIA AND ANOSMIA. HAY FEVER. The etiology and pathology of this affectior*are by no means understood : all that is certain in connection with it is that the pollen of certain grasses is the commonest exciting cause of the symptoms. Symptoms.—In a severe case these consist of watering at the eyes, with congestion of the conjunctiva, swelling of the eyelids, a profuse watery discharge from the nose, with constant sneezing and complete nasal obstruction. The whole nose appears to be red, swollen and hot, the patient's throat becomes dry, he suffers from severe headache and occasionally from considerable embarrassment of the respiration,—a kind of hay asthma. These symptoms commence quite suddenly in an apparently healthy person soon after exposure to the exciting influences, and slowly pass off when the latter have been removed. Many persons have periodical attacks lasting from three to four weeks during the season of the flowering of the grasses, and in some years the attacks .are much more severe than in others. The patient is frequently quite free from the disease if he spends the hay-fever season at the seaside or in a large town. In other cases the affection lasts the whole of the summer. Strangely enough it is unknown in the tropics. Pathological changes.—Examination of the nose in many cases reveals some abnormality. There may be a deflected septum, or a spur on the septum in contact with the inferior turbinate : swelling or hypertrophy of the inferior turbinate with a peculiar, greyish, sodden-looking mucous membrane : or hypertrophy of the middle turbinate with or without small polypi. In many of these cases peculiarly sensitive spots may be found on the upper part of the septum near the anterior end of the middle turbinate, the mucous membrane being abnormally thick and pale. In some cases <

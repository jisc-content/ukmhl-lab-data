INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS OF ACCESSORY SINUSES. 345 making a large opening into the mouth is not to be recommended, for a permanent opening in this position is by no means desirable. The best method of obtaining permanent free drainage in all cases of chronic suppuration in the antrum is to establish a large opening between that cavity and the inferior meatus of the nose, which shall be permanent and large enough to prevent subsequent accumulation of pus in the cavity. The operation consists of the following steps. 1. An incision about 1 inch long is made over the canine fossa at the reflection of the mucous mem- brane from the alveolar border on to the cheek and carried at once right down to the bone, and the periosteum is reflected both above and below Fig. 124.â€”The Radical Operation upon the Maxillary Antrum; a. Outer wall of antrum ; b, inner wall, the removal of this should be much more complete than is here shown ; c, outer surface of inferior turbinate ; d, inferior meatus. the incision. 2. A large opening is next made in the anterior wall of the antrum, preferably by chiselling, through which the finger is passed and the interior of the cavity thoroughly explored. 3. All polypi and granula- tions are removed and carious spots of bone thoroughly scraped, taking care not to remove the lining membrane of the cavity for, as has been said above, the antrum is generally too large a cavity to fill with granula- tion tissue. 4. Finally a large opening is broken into the inferior meatus of the nose by puncture with a large trochar or by a burr. The whole of the septum between the antrum and the inferior meatus is then chipped away piece by piece with the bone forceps or chisel (see Fig. 124). After the completion of the operation the outer opening is allowed to close and all subsequent treatment is conducted from the nose. The opening into

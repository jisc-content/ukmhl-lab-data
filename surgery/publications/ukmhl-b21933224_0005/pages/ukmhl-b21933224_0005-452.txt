424 THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE LARYNX. finger passed into the larynx until the upper aperture of the tube can be felt; the extractor with the blades closed is then guided in to the upper aperture of the tube when its blades are separated and the tube grasped and withdrawn. Comparison with tracheotomy.â€”Intubation is a simple operation giving immediate relief, and can be very rapidly carried out. It avoids a cutting operation with loss of blood, shock and the necessity for an anaesthetic and there is no open wound to become infected. It has however the disadvantages that the tube may become blocked and require immediate removal, that in some cases there is a difficulty in retaining it and, if coughed up, asphyxia may occur before there is time to re-insert it, that there is difficulty in administering food and that, if too long retained, it may cause erosion or ulceration. It gives, however, much better results in children under five suffering from acute laryngeal stenosis than does tracheotomy. Tracheotomy however is safer in older children, when a skilled attendant is not always at hand, and it is necessary when the obstruction is low down. Again, the consent of the parents is far more easily obtained to intubation. After tracheotomy more skilled nursing is required, and convalescence is- prolonged, but, the tube being fixed in, there is less danger of sudden asphyxia and therefore less need for the constant presence of the surgeon.'

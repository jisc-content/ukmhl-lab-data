io8 THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE FACE. base of the skull, where the bone is thin, great care must be taken not to cause sloughing of the dura mater and septic infection. Whatever caustic be used it should be allowed to act for several hours at least, as its action must extend deeply to be of any use. Boracic fomentations should be applied to facilitate the separation of the sloughs caused by the caustic, and, when granulation is complete, the healing may be hastened by the application of skin-grafts. Careful watch must however be kept to see whether any fresh thickening or ulceration occurs, in which case immediate destruction of the affected area by caustics or the knife must be resorted to. Sometimes the tumour is so large that the defect left requires a very extensive plastic operation (see Chap. XII.); failing that, a suitably coloured celluloid or wax shield must be modelled to hide the deformity. It is said that the light-bath treatment for lupus has also a very beneficial effect upon rodent ulcer. We only mention the matter here, as it is a question that is still sub judice and upon which no definite opinion can well be pronounced.

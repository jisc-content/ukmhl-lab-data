DIVISION II. THE INTRINSIC DISEASES OF THE NOSE, EAR AND LARYNX. By H. LAMBERT LACK, M.D. (Lond.), F.R.C.S. SECTION I.—AFFECTIONS OF THE NOSE. CHAPTER XXV. THE ANATOMY OF THE NOSE. Before proceeding to the subject proper of this section it seems well to draw attention briefly to some of the chief points in the anatomy of the nose from a surgical point of view, this subject being new and much too briefly dealt with in anatomical text-books. THE VESTIBULE.—The entrance to the nose, or vestibule, is lined by squamous epithelium continuous with that of the skin, and is separated by a sharp line from the nasal fossa proper. The opening is protected by several large stiff hairs or vibrissas. THE NASAL FOSS-ffi.—The nasal fossae are two extremely irregular cavities which are divided into four more or less horizontal channels by the three turbinate bodies (see Fig. 89). The inferior turbinate is largest in front and tapers posteriorly; the inferior meatus is narrowed anteriorly and posteriorly and much more roomy in the centre, the outer wall of the nose bending strongly outwards at its centre (see Fig. 93). The shape of the inferior meatus, which has been well compared to that of a boat with a small piece of either end removed, is of considerable surgical importance, for in cases of undue narrowness of the nasal passages direct access to the larger middle part of the meatus is obtained by removing the anterior extremity of the inferior turbinate, and thus free nasal respira-

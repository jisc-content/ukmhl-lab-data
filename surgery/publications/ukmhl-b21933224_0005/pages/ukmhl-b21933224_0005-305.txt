METHODS OF EXAMINATION OF THE NOSE. 277 Gas.—An Argand burner or one of the incandescent lamps may be used; the latter give a powerful white light, but are somewhat trying to the eye. The best form of stand is that shown in Fig. 100. Where the electric light is not available, gas is the most generally useful illuminant. The oxy-hydrogen lime-light. — This is perhaps the best light of all, but it is by far the most trouble- some to manage. The apparatus may be fixed on a tripod stand and can be carried about and erected any- where. Such a lamp gives a diffuse bright light with a very strong fine central beam. The illumination shows objects almost in their natural colours and is very powerful and pleasant to use. It is suitable when in constant use, but the apparatus is cumbersome and for ordinary purposes it is not nearly so convenient as the electric light. Should none of these lights be obtainable, an ordinary parafine lamp may be used. This may be fitted Laryngjscopv. with a reflector and a bull's-eye as for gas. Such a lamp may be easily made suitable to carry about in an instrument bag; in this case it should have a broad flat bottom, and the Fig. too.—Mackenzie's Lamp for Laryngoscopy. This lamp has an Argand burner and may easily be adapted to stand upon the table. top of the oil should be covered by two or three layers of finely chopped cork, to prevent its being spilt when shaken. The Head Mirror.—The interior of the nose must always be examined by reflected light, and for this purpose a frontal mirror is required. This may bu fixed on the surgeon's head by either a band or a spectacle frame. Fig. 99.—Greville MacDonald's Lamp for

88 THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE HEAD. posterior line between the glabella and the occipital protuberance of about 670. It is about three and three-quarter inches long. Any variation in / Fig. 22.—Reid's Method ok Cerebral Localisation. AB is Reid's base line, and runs from the lower margin of the orbit backwards through the centre of the external auditory meatus. From this two lines are drawn upwards at right angles, one, CD, from the depression just in front of the ear to the middle line of the skull (from the glabella to the ext. occip. protuberance) and the other, EF, from the posterior border of the mastoid process to the same line. The line GK indicates the horizontal limb of the fissure of Sylvius, and runs from a point \\ inch directly behind the external angular process of the frontal, to another point } inch below the parietal eminence *. The point A" at which this line meets the middle line of the skull, localises fairly accurately the mesial end of the Parieto-Occipital sulcus. The fissure of Rolando corresponds mainly to a line drawn from F to //, the point of intersection of the fissure of Sylvius with the vertical line CD. The bifurcation of the Sylvian fissure lies about J inch behind G on the line GA~, and the vertical limb runs upwards from that point for about 1 inch. Z. = Lambdoid suture. P—0= Parieto-Occipital fissure. ^ = Fissure of Sylvius. R = Fissure of Rolando. .9? = Squamous suture. C=Coronal suture. * = Parietal eminence. The drawing is from the same preparation as that used for Fig. 21. its direction, which is not uncommon, is usually so slight as not to affect the operation because the trephine hole is large enough to include these variations. Various methods have been introduced with the view of localising the fissure. One of the first was Reid's method in which what is known as Reid's base line was drawn round the head from the orbit

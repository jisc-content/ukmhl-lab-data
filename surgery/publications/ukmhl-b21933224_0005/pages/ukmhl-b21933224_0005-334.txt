3o6 THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE NOSE. Removal of the posterior end of the itiferior turbinate.—For this opera- tion it is usually advisable to give a general anaesthetic; gas may be used if only one turbinate be affected, but if both sides require to be operated upon, an anaesthesia of three or four minutes' duration is required. The bone at the posterior extremity of the inferior turbinate is usually very small, and consequently soft parts alone require to be removed. This can be best accomplished with a snare. The patient being anaesthetised, is turned on to his left side, and, the surgeon standing always on the left side of the patient, passes his left Fig. 114.—Removal of the Posterior End of the Inferior Turbinate. Showing the loop of the snare in position, and the method of holding it with the finger. forefinger up into the post-nasal space. The wire loop of the snare is then passed down the inferior meatus of the side to be operated upon until it comes in contact with the finger in the post-nasal space. If the nostril be considerably obstructed it is advisable to use a stiff wire and a small loop which can afterwards be opened out by the finger. This loop is hooked round the posterior extremity of the turbinate and held in position by firm pressure with the finger (see Fig. 114). The handle of the snare is bent over to the opposite side so as to press the point of the snare well into the mucous membrane of the turbinate. The wire is then rapidly drawn tight until a firm hold is obtained, after which it should be tightened as slowly as possible until the parts are cut off. It is a good plan when both sides are being operated upon to tighten up the wire on one side and then to leave it in position while the other side is being similarly treated. In this way, if three, four or more minutes be taken to tighten the snare, even very large masses can be removed with the loss of a very few drops

THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE LARYNX. 422 to the larynx with small, soft, camel's hair brushes mounted upon long metal handles bent at right angles two or three inches from the point. These should always be introduced by the surgeon himself with the aid of the laryngoscope. Caustics, such as chromic acid, should be applied in a similar manner, fused upon a probe or a special carrier. Intubation of the larynx.—In cases of stenosis of the larynx from whatever cause arising, if dyspnoea be produced or asphyxia threatened, relief may be obtained by one of two procedures, namely tracheotomy or intubation. The former operation is described elsewhere (see p. 248). Intubation is most often employed in acute laryngeal stenosis in children, as in diphtheria, acute ©edematous laryngitis, etc. Instruments.—The instruments required are a set of O'Dwyer's tubes of varying sizes, an introducer, extractor, gag and a scale (see Fig. 141)- The tube is an irregular cylinder bulging at the centre so as to prevent its being expelled from the larynx by coughing, and with an expanded rounded head to rest upon the ventricular bands. Anteriorly there is a small perforation in the head to which is attached a loop of silk. The introducer is a rod with a separate jointed extremity for each tube. A sliding tube manipulated by a button on the handle fits over this rod and allows the tube to be detached when it has been placed in position in the larynx. The extractor somewhat resembles a pair of laryngeal forceps, but its two short blades open outwards when the lever in the handle is pressed. Method.—The child is wrapped round with a blanket to restrain its arms, and firmly supported in the sitting position by a nurse. An assistant

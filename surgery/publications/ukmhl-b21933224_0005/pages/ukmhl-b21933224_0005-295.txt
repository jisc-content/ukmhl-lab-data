THE ANATOMY OF THE NOSE. 267 and-especially the uncinate process, form a most serious obstacle to the passage of a probe, etc., into the frontal sinus. The superior meatus is comparatively small and lies between the middle and superior turbinates: it receives the openings of the posterior ethmoidal cells. The fourth or Fig. 90.—Vertical Anteroposterior Section through the Nasal Foss/e somewhat TO the Left of the Middle Line. The middle turbinate has been removed and a dissection made to expose the structures on the outer wall of the nose. a. Uvula; b. soft palate; c.

The sphenoidal sinus opens into it near its upper part (see Fig. 90). THE SEPTUM.—The septum of the nose is formed in front by the triangular cartilage, and posteriorly by the vomer and the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid. It is very often asymmetrical; the bony part is more

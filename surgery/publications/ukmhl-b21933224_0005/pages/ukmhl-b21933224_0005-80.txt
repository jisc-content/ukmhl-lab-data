CHAPTER IV. INTRA-CRANIAL SUPPURATION. The following forms of intra-cranial suppuration may follow injuries, especi- ally compound fractures : (i) suppuration between the dura mater and the skull; (2) localised suppuration beneath the dura; (3) diffuse lepto- meningitis ; and (4) cerebral abscess. These conditions may also arise as the result of suppurating wounds of the scalp or necrosis of the skull, and may follow suppuration in the frontal sinus, the middle ear, and the mastoid antrum. The processes are very similar whether they arise from injury or from disease, but it will be more convenient, as far as treatment is concerned, to speak first of intra-cranial suppuration as it arises after an injury, and subsequently of the affection as it originates from disease, notably of the middle ear. INTRA-CRANIAL SUPPURATION FOLLOWING INJURY. EXTRA DURAL SUPPURATION.â€”This condition very rarely follows an injury unless there be an external wound, and it most often complicates compound fracture. Sub-dural abscess may, however, result from an acute osteo-myelitis subsequent to an injury without an external wound. The affection begins as an inflammatory thickening of the outer surface of the dura mater with effusion of fluid beneath it; in the majority of cases suppuration subsequently occurs between the membrane and the skull and leads to the formation of an extra-dural abscess. When there is no external wound or when the inflammation occurs at a little distance from the wound, there is developed what is known as " Pott's puffy tumour" over the seat of the suppuration. This is a limited cedematous swelling of the scalp associated with symptoms of meningitis and subsequently of compression. The puffy tumour is due to the effusion of fluid beneath the pericranium accompanied by oedema of the tissues superficial to the affected part. It almost always indicates the formation of an abscess between the bone and the dura mater, and usually also

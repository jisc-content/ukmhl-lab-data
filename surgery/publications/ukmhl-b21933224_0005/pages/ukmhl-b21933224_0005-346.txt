3i8 THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE NOSE. In cases in which there is troublesome bleeding, the nose should be packed, but generally haemorrhage, although rather brisk at first, soon ceases, and there is no need to adopt any special means to arrest it. After the first 24 hours the nose should be irrigated daily until healing has taken place. The result of this operation, provided it be done in suitable cases, is extremely satisfactory; healing is complete in from ten to twenty days, and, the whole of the disease being removed, no further trouble ensues. 2. In the second stage, it is well to remove the polypi with the snare. This operation, done under local anaesthesia, is extremely simple, and is far less painful than any other method of removing polypi. There A B Fig. 117.â€”Removal of the Anterior End of the Middlf.

MacKenzie's snare (see Fig. 118) works steadily and therefore painlessly and is easy to manipulate, but has the great disadvantages of being very difficult to sterilise or clean; it makes a disagreeable clicking noise; it is somewhat tiresome to replace the wire, which is damaged after being used once or twice; further it will only act well with a thin wire. Another excellent snare is Blake's (see Fig. 119), which is especially valuable in nervous patients as it works quietly and quickly, and in cases of small polypi situated high up in the nose. It is a slender instrument and not strong enough for tough growths. It should be threaded either with very fine wire or with gimp, and causes the least pain of all. Krause's snare (see Fig. 144), or the one recommended previously with its slender shaft attached (see p. 303), may also be used. The two last have the advantages

CHAPTER XIV. THE AFFECTIONS OF THE AURICULAR AND PAROTID REGIONS. DEFORMITIES OF THE AURICLE. The chief congenital deformities of the auricle calling for a plastic operation are either excessive size or undue prominence of the organ. If the auricle be unduly pro77iinent, an attempt may be made to fasten back the ear by removing a triangular portion of the skin and cartilage of sufficient size from the posterior surface of the pinna; the amount of skin and cartilage taken will vary according to the degree of the deformity. When the parts are stitched together the ear should lie back in its normal position, and enough of the cartilage must be removed to enable it to do so. The cut edges of the cartilage are united by separate catgut sutures. Excessive size of the auricle may be diminished by taking wedge-shaped pieces out of the whole thickness of the pinna, the vertical measurement being reduced by taking a wedge from the upper part with its apex near the external meatus, and the abnormal breadth being reduced by taking out a strip of cartilage and skin from the middle portion (see Fig. 73). MALIGNANT DISEASE OF THE AURICLE. As long as the malignant growth is confined to the auricle there is no difficulty in the treatment, which consists in the removal of sufficient of the auricle to leave healthy tissue all around the disease. In some cases, however, the malignant disease begins in the external auditory meatus or in the auricle in its immediate vicinity, and spreads rapidly up the meatus; the operation then becomes much more difficult and more doubtful, as the disease very early affects the glands in the parotid region, and, when these are involved, the chances of eradicating the disease by operation are very slight, unless, indeed, the parotid gland be removed as a whole, or at any rate be opened up without any regard to the facial nerve. Any attempt to combine a removal of

444 THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE LARYNX. the pharynx are best left alone as their division is usually followed by more severe contraction. If on the other hand there be but a thin web-like adhesion which has so much reduced the lumen of the larynx that tracheotomy has become necessary an attempt should be made to remove it so as to dispense with the tube. The best method is to wait until active symptoms have subsided and then to perform thyrotomy, to excise all the obstructing tissue and subsequently to keep the parts separated until healing has taken place. The thyrotomy wound is sutured, but the tracheotomy tube is retained in the tracheal wound and a metal plug (see Fig. 143) is passed upwards from the lower wound through the constricted part of the larynx and retained in position for four or five months. A solid plug is preferable co a tube as it is more easy to introduce and does not collect secretion and thus does not require to be so often removed for cleansing. By this means the dilatation of the stricture can be maintained until all fear of contraction has passed off, without producing much inconvenience to the patient. On the other hand dilators introduced through the mouth are generally ineffectual and cause great distress to the patient, and the same may be said of intubation.

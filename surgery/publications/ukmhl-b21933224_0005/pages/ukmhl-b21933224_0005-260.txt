SECTION IV.—THE LARYNX AND TRACHEA, CHAPTER. XX. CONGENITAL AFFECTIONS: INJURIES. PERSISTENT THYRO-GLOSSAL TRACT. This embryonic structure commences at the foramen caecum on the dorsum of the tongue and runs downwards in the middle line of that organ, passing between the posterior surface of the body of the hyoid bone and the front of the thyroid cartilage to the isthmus of the thyroid gland; the thyroid isthmus is developed from it. As a rule the entire tract is obliterated, but the whole or a portion of it may remain and give rise to a central fistula which is situated just above the thyroid isthmus. In other cases again the tract may be obliterated at both ends and an unobliterated portion in the centre may become dilated, leading to the formation of a cyst, either in the neighbourhood of the base of the tongue or very commonly just in front of the thyro-hyoid membrane and extending upwards behind the hyoid bone. TREATMENT.—(a) Of a fistula.—Sometimes a thyro-glossal fistula may cause very little trouble and it may not be necessary to adopt any treatment for it. Operation should never be lightly undertaken, as the satisfactory treatment of this condition is a matter of very considerable difficulty. In many cases, however, the fistula discharges fairly freely and is a source of so much irritation and discomfort to the patient that he insists on something being done. The only treatment likely to do any good is an attempt to dissect out the fistula completely. It will not close until its epithelial lining has been entirely removed, and any attempt short of excision, such as destruction by caustics or the cautery, invariably fails. The removal of the fistula, if complete, is not easy. An incision is carried downwards from the upper border of the hyoid bone, diverging below so as to enclose the orifice of the fistula. The fistulous tract is defined by passing a stout probe along it, and its wall is then dissected out.

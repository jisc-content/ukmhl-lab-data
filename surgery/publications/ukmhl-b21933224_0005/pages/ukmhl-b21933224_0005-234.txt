206 THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE JAWS. curve downwards immediately in front of the tragus. The flap is dissected up with care, watch being kept for branches of the facial nerve which if seen are pulled out of the way. The posterior portion of the masseter muscle is detached from the zygoma and the capsule of the joint is exposed and opened by a vertical incision; the condyle is sufficiently cleared to enable it to be divided either by cutting pliers or a fine chisel. The separated condyle is then seized with a pair of forceps and twisted out, any firm fibrous connections being divided with the point of the knife. It is most important to keep the point of the knife closely in apposition with the bone so as to avoid injury to the internal maxillary artery. The fibro-cartilage is left behind and the wound sewn up without a drainage tube. Enough bone must be removed to leave a good gap between the neck of the condyle and the eminentia articularis. It is very common to find slight facial paralysis after the operation, but this is usually due to stretching of the nerve and is quite transient. Passive movements should be commenced immedi- ately after the operation, at first under an anaesthetic, such as gas and oxygen; after the lapse of a few days however the movements will be less painful and the use of a gag which is opened by a screw should be commenced. When the gag is not being used, the mouth should be propped open with an ordinary dental prop. The results are best when the affection is one-sided. Even in bilateral cases however, if the treatment be persevered with for a considerable time, satisfactory results may be obtained; but it is important to caution the patient that the treatment must be perseveringly carried out. for a very long period, for several months at any rate, and it must be especially vigorously resorted to if any tendency to re-contraction should be noticed.

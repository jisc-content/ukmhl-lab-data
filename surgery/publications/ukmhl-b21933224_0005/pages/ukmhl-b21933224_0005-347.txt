319 CHRONIC INFLAMMATIONS. of being very strong; the wire loop can be easily withdrawn and replaced; a thick wire can be used, and the operation can be rapidly completed. The shaft of Krause's snare is a little clumsy. In passing the wire of a snare round a polypus, the loop should be inserted vertically, either between the polypus and the septum or between Fig. 118.—Mokell Mackenzie's Snake (modified by Hovell). The wire is wound round the drum A, and is rapidly tightened by the handle and ratchet B and C. D is a more powerful handle for the last few turns. E is the screw releasing the tube F for cleaning, and G is a second beak to the instrument. the polypus and the outer wall of the nose, as may be most convenient. The lower part of the loop should then be carefully manipulated round the lower edge of the polypus, and the tip of the snare and the loop pushed well up round the base of the growth, the wire being slowly tightened as Fig. 119.— Blake's Snake for Nasal Polypi. this is done. The wire may be pulled tight and the polypus thus cut through ; but it is usually better, although a little more painful, to use a fairly thick wire, to tighten it firmly round the base of the growth, and then to pull the whole mass away. In doing this, a piece of the surrounding mucous membrane, and sometimes a second polypus, may be removed. Wherever possible, an attempt should be made to enclose a piece of bone in the snare, and if the polypus be growing from the middle turbinate this can usually be accomplished. If the wire be round the bone, a firm resist- ance will be at once detected, and then it is better to cut it through rather

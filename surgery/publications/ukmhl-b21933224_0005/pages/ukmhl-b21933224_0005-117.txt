89 TUMOURS OF THE HKAIN. to the external occipital protuberance (see Fig. 22). Two lines are drawn at right angles to this, one running upwards just in front of the external auditory meatus and the other, running upwards from the* posterior border of the mastoid process. The direction of the fissure of Rolando is from the junction of the upper end of the latter line with the antero-posterior line, down to the point of junction of the anterior vertical line with Reid's line marking out the horizontal limb of the Fissure of Sylvius which is a line drawn from a point i{ inches directly behind the external angular process of the frontal to another point f inch beneath the parietal eminence. Fig. 23.—The Relations of the Middle Meningeal Artery to the Sutures of the Skull. A= Posterior branch of the middle meningeal. C = Anterior branch.! D = Anterior inferior angle of the parietal bone. £= Posterior inferior angle of the parietal. The drawing is made from a preparation by Prof. Arthur Robinson of King's College. One of the easiest methods of locating the fissure of Rolando is by using the simple instrument suggested by Professor Horsley—the so-called " Rolandometer" (see Fig. 24). This is made of flexible metal so that it can be easily sterilised and adjusted to the surface of the skull. When the long limb is placed over the antero-posterior line of the skull with the smaller angle (670) looking forward and the point of junction of the two limbs about 5 centimetres behind the bregma, the shorter limb will indicate sufficiently accurately the direction of the fissure. This arm is graduated so that the length of the fissure can be marked off on the scalp. Should this instrument not be available, a very easy means of replacing it is that suggested by Professor Chiene. He takes a square piece of paper and folds it diagonally so as to make a triangle whose lesser angles are 450.

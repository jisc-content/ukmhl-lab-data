For very small tumours it may not be necessary to operate at all. MICROCEPHALUS. This condition has attracted much attention of late, but on the whole it cannot be said that any material benefit has resulted. In microcephalus the head is small and the general condition probably depends on the Fig. 20.â€”Incisions for Craniectomy. A very large number of incisions have been employed, of which the above are perhaps the best. imperfect development of the brain. The disease has been supposed by some to be due to a premature ossification of the skull preventing the due expansion of the brain, and on this theory extensive operations aiming at loosening portions of the skull, so as to allow of the expansion of the brain, have been undertaken. It is most probable, however, that the disease is primarily due to interference with the development of the brain, and that the early ossification is the result of the non-development of this organ. The operations cannot be said to have been followed by any marked success, and it is questionable whether they are really justifiable; we ourselves cannot advise their performance. The accompanying diagram shows the various methods by which the skull has been enlarged (see Fig. 20).

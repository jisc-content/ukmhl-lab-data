INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS. 211 TUBERCULOUS DISEASE OF THE JAWS. This affection is not common and chiefly occurs in the upper jaw, more especially about the orbital margin and in the neighbourhood of the malar bone; it may also occur in the lower jaw somewhere in the neighbourhood of the angle. The treatment is similar to that of tuber- culous disease of bone elsewhere (see Part III., p. 198); when the disease is superficial, the tuberculous focus should be removed at an early date ; should the case not come under observation until the disease has consider- ably advanced, attempts should be made to eradicate it by an operation planned so as to do as little injury to the parts as possible and to avoid secondary scarring of the face as much as one can. PHOSPHORUS NECROSIS. This condition has already been fully described (see Part III., p. 194) and nothing further need be said about it here. ACTINOMYCOSIS OF THE JAW. This affection like the last has already been fully dealt with in connec- tion with diseases of bone (see Part III., p. 219) and needs no further reference here. It is not a common affection of the jaw.

CHAPTER XXXII. DISEASES OF THE NASO-PHARYNX. ACUTE NASO-PHARYNGITIS OR ACUTE POST-NASAL CATARRH. This affection is usually associated with acute rhinitis, but may occur separately. It is common in children with adenoid growths, but may also be found in adults. It is accompanied by general malaise, painful feelings in the back of the throat, and is very liable to be associated with Eustachian obstruction, ear-ache, and deafness. The affection is usually a mild one, and subsides in a few days. The treatment is similar to that of an ordinary cold (see p. 295), but especial attention must be directed to the ears in order to prevent acute otitis (see 384). CHRONIC POST-NASAL CATARRH. This is a very common condition, and is associated with excessive discharge of mucus from the naso-pharynx. The mucus is especially annoying in the morning, having collected during the quiet breathing of sleep, and on rising a great quantity may be coughed or ' hawked' up. The affection is especially common among dwellers in cold damp climates, in dusty places, and in large cities. Many cases are associated with enlargement of the pharyngeal tonsil, and it also frequently occurs in adults who have undoubtedly suffered from adenoids in earlier years. It is most commonly met with, however, as the sequel of a neglected cold in the head, especially in those who are in any way debilitated. The use of tobacco or alcohol is a well-recognised predisposing cause. In some cases the secretion can be seen lying in a fold or crypt in the median line of the post-nasal space, a central depression between the lateral adenoid masses of the pharyngeal tonsil, commonly called the pharyngeal bursa. The affection is essentially a chronic one. It is always worse in winter and damp weather, and improves greatly in warm dry weather. Treatment.â€”In the first place it is well to seek for and remove

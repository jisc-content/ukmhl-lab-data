175 CLEFT PALATE. or a sharp hook and the needle withdrawn, leaving the loop emerging from the upper .surface of the flap (see Fig. 70). With a needle curved in the opposite direction, a silkworm-gut stitch is passed at a corresponding point Fig. 69 a.â€”Needles and Needi.e-Hoi.der for Cleft Palate Operations. A is the ordinary form, and is used in pairs, one needle being curved to the right and the other to the left. B is a very useful form employed by Prof. Rose. It is easy to stab it through the flaps. C is Lane's needle-holder, which is useful for Davies-Colley's operation (see p. 177). The needles for use with it are shown full size. through the other flap. The end of this is seized with forceps, unthreaded from the eye of the needle and the latter withdrawn. The free end of the gut is brought out into the cleft, and then bent into a loop which is passed through the silk loop already introduced; by traction upon the free ends of the latter the silkworm-gut suture is drawn into place through the opposite flap1 (see Fig. 70, c, c). It is well to clamp both ends of the stitch in forceps, and leave it untied until all the other sutures are in position. It is unnecessary to grasp the edge of the flaps in introducing these stitches; indeed it is desirable not to do so on account of the risk of bruising. If the edge of the flap be put on the stretch by pulling on the uvula, a sharp needle can be stabbed through the palate with ease. The next stitch is best put in about the middle of the hard palate, and then the remaining ] To permit of this being clone, the eye of the palate needle must be of large size so as to take really thick silkworm-gut. Should such a needle not be available, the second method indicated in Fig. 70 (see I, 1', 2, 2'), i.e. the use of two silk loops must be adopted.

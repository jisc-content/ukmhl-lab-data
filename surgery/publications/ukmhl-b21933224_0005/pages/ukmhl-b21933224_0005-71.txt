INTRA-CRANIAL INJURIES. 43 according to the seat of the rupture and the extent of the haemorrhage. It is very necessary to know the external surface markings which will enable the artery and its branches to be mapped out upon the scalp. The following are the chief landmarks: the anterior branch of the middle meningeal is situated about an inch and a half behind the external angular process of the frontal bone and about the same distance above Fig. ii.â€”Middle Meningeal Hemorrhage. The fracture is seen to traverse both the vault and the base of the skull. The situation of the clot is the one usually met with. (Helferich.) the zygomatic process. Another method given is to draw a line from the middle of the glabella1 to the apex of the mastoid process and at the mid-point of this line to draw another at right angles to it; the point where this line crosses one drawn from the glabella to the external occipital protuberance will indicate the position of the artery (see Fig. 23). The posterior branch crosses the posterior inferior angle of the parietal at a spot corresponding to the point of intersection of a base line drawn 1 The glabella is the smooth space directly above the root of the nose, midway between the two superciliary ridges.

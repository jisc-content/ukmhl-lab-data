CHAPTER XVIII. TUMOURS OF THE JAWS. DENTAL CYSTS. It is not very uncommon to find cysts in the jaws which originate in connection with the teeth. These cysts are of three kinds : i. Dentigerous cysts, 2. Simple cysts, and 3. Multilocular cysts. DENTIGEROUS CYSTS.—These are cysts containing a clear, some- what mucoid fluid, unilocular but with either a well-developed tooth or the rudiments of a tooth in their interior. The cysts may occur in either the upper or the lower jaw and usually develop in connection with the per- manent teeth; in one or two cases, however, dentigerous cysts have been found in connection with the temporary teeth. They therefore usually appear during the age of the second dentition, between 7 and 30 years of age. The cysts increase slowly and gradually expand and thin the bone around, so that in advanced cases there is the sensation known as "egg- shell crackling" on pressure; indeed the bone may be actually destroyed and fluctuation may be obtained. In the upper jaw the cysts extend upwards and bulge into the antrum and they also dilate the bone outwards so as to form a prominence on the cheek. SIMPLE CYSTS.—Simple cysts not containing a tooth also occur in the jaws and probably develop in connection with the root rather than with the crown of the tooth as is the case with the dentigerous cysts. They are said to be more frequent in the upper jaw than in the lower, and in connection with the incisors or canines more often than with the molars. They may occur not only in young adults but also at a later period of life. The progress of the cyst is the same as that of a dentigerous cyst. MULTILOCULAR CYSTS.—These are most commonly found in the lower jaw. They may invade the greater part of the ramus and lead to the formation of irregular nodular tumours which sometimes fluctuate in parts. On section there are numerous cysts of varying size which com- municate with one another and which in all probability are developed

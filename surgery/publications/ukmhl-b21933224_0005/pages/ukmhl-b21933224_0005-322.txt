THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE NOSE. RHINOLITHS. These are concretions, sometimes apparently originating spontaneously or forming around a small plug of mucus, but most commonly having a nucleus consisting of a small foreign body. The stone is almost invariably single, and the surface roughened and black, probably from blood pigment. In some cases the rhinoliths grow to a considerable size and are firmly embedded in the nasal mucous membrane. They can generally be removed in the same way as foreign bodies, but sometimes it is necessary to break them before doing so. This may be done with a strong pair of forceps or with bone pliers.

'l6o THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE FACE. are introduced on each side in order to keep the parts in position, and the divided upper lip is sutured in the middle line after short lateral cuts have been made on each side beneath the nose so as to allow the upper part of the lip to slide in below the new columella (see Fig. 56). The Tagliacotian method.â€”This plan, although successful in some cases, is on the whole unsatisfactory, and entails great inconvenience and the use of special apparatus. In it the arm is fixed to the forehead so that the elbow comes opposite the nose, and a large Map is then fashioned from the skin over the biceps and made tfc cover the defect in the nose. The arm must be kept in this position for about four weeks before the pedicle of the flap can be divided. The position is however so very irksome that few patients will submit to it, while the new nose is even more apt to shrink than the one formed by a flap from the forehead ; the only advantage of the method is the avoidance of extra scarring about the face or forehead. The accompanying sketch (see Fig. 57) will sufficiently illustrate the position of the arm and the mode of attachment of the flap.

270 THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE NOSE. to the canine fossa externally. The bone forming it is thin, but not nearly so thin as that forming the inner wall, and it requires considerable force to puncture it. The roof of the antrum separates that cavity from the orbit and is a thin plate of bone: it is not uncommonly perforated in disease, with the consequent formation of an orbital abscess. Fig. 93.â€”Horizontal Section of the Nose about half an inch above its Floor, viewed from above. On the left side the inferior turbinate has been entirely removed to show the antro-meatal septum, a. Large spur on the septum; b. inferior turbinate; c. cavity of the antrum; d. inferior meatus; e. septum. The cavity of the antrum varies much in size, but is usually from 25 to 30 millimeters in diameter, both antero-posteriorly and vertically. In a few very rare cases the antrum may be extremely ill-developed: it may even be limited to a mere cleft in the bone or to a small cavity on a level with the middle meatus of the nose (see Fig. 94). In these cases it may be impossible to perforate it either from the alveolar margin or from the inferior meatus of the nose. The shape of the superior maxilla, with a high-arched palate, a narrow prominent alveolar border and with a hollow in the canine fossa, may give some clue to the smallness of the cavity. The antrum is commonly traversed by irregular bony septa, or by membranous folds, and very rarely may be divided by such partitions into two separate cavities (see Figs. 91, 92). The antrum is present at birth as an extremely small cavity (half to one millimeter in diameter), but after the

CHAPTER III. INTRA-CRANIAL INJURIES. The effect of a severe injury to the head is not limited to the scalp or the skull but is also exerted on the contents of the cranium; various intra- cranial affections may arise according to the force, the situation and the nature of the injury, and especially according to whether or not there is a simple or a compound fracture of the skull. The chief of these intra-cranial affections are, concussion, contusion or laceration of the brain, compression of the brain from various causes, of which the chief is intra-cranial haemor- rhage, and various inflammatory phenomena, such as extra-dural, sub-dural or cerebral abscess, lepto-meningitis, phlebitis and thrombosis of the sinuses. CONCUSSION OF THE BRAIN. By concussion of the brain is meant a state of unconsciousness into which a patient falls after a severe injury and before enough haemorrhage has taken place to cause symptoms of compression. Concussion of the brain is, in fact, practically a condition of shock resulting from disturbance of the nervous centres. There has been much discussion as to what happens in concussion of the brain. The original idea was that an altera- tion took place in the functions of the brain without any actual lesion, but much dispute has arisen as to the possibility of this. It has been found that in patients who have died during the stage of concussion there has always been more or less haemorrhage into the substance of the brain, and in some cases distinct laceration has existed; some authors have therefore asserted that in all cases of concussion there is an actual lesion of the brain. On the other hand, it certainly seems reasonable to suppose that when force is applied to the head the semi-fluid brain and the cerebro- spinal fluid would be forcibly thrown into commotion and that, as the result of these violent oscillations of the brain substance, temporary dis- turbance, ending in more or less complete suspension of function of the

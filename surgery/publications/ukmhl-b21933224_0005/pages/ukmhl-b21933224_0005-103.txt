75 SINUS THROMBOSIS. Treatment.—The principles of treatment have been already fully dis- cussed in connection with the lateral sinus (see p. 63). Unfortunately these principles cannot be fully carried out, either in the case of the cavernous or the transverse sinus, but they should be borne in mind in case it may be possible to carry them into effect in any particular instance. TUBERCULOUS MENINGITIS. In this condition there is a deposit of tubercles in the pia mater, especially about the vessels at the base of the brain. The result is in- Fig. 19.—Drainage of the Fourth Ventricle. The drawing is made from a section of the skull of a foetus just before birth, and shows how the cerebellar sub- arachnoid space is tapped by opening the skull below the inferior curved line. After birth the cerebellum becomes proportionately larger and the space smaller. eit The opening in the skull; b, the tentorium cerebelli. The preparation was made by Prof. Arthur Robinson of King's College. flammation and effusion, acute distention of the ventricles with fluid, and increased intra-cranial pressure. Treatment.—Attempts have been made to relieve this pressure by draining the ventricles, or by inserting a drain through the condyloid foramen, but, although immediate symptoms are often relieved by the drainage of the cerebro-spinal fluid, no permanent good can be expected of it. One or two cases have certainly recovered after drainage of this kind, but it is doubtful whether the condition was tuberculous or merely a simple meningitis. The following is the best procedure for draining the posterior part of the cranial cavity (see Fig. 19). The head is shaved, scrupulously purified in the usual manner (see p. 7), and flexed as much as possible upon the sternum so as to render.the occipital

LARYNGEAL PHTHISIS. 447 left after removal seems to be very slight, and probably can be prevented by suitable after-treatment. To remove the tumours, the larynx should be thoroughly anaesthetised and the growth cleanly cut away with forceps, such as Krause's (see Fig- I44), or, if this be impossible, the growths may be scraped away with Fig. 144.—Krause's Nasal Snare and Laryngeal Cutting Forceps, a Heryng's curette (see Fig. 145). As soon as the bleeding has ceased, the surface should be dried and chromic acid fused on a probe or a special carrier thoroughly rubbed into it. The after-treatment must be carefully carried out. The larynx should be inspected at least twice a week, when solutions of lactic acid (50% or Fig. 145.—Hering's Laryngeal Curettes and Knives. 60%) should be applied with a brush. For this cocaine is not usually necessary. If there be much secretion in the larynx it is well to wash it away every day or even oftener with an alkaline spray (see p. 420), and iodoform may be insufflated on to the wound. If there be pain on swal- lowing, a mixture of equal parts of orthoform and iodoform may be used until the ulcer is healed. 3. Of intrinsic laryngeal tuberculosis.—When superficial ulceration

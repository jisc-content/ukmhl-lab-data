CHAPTER XLII. TUBERCULOSIS OF THE LARYNX. LARYNGEAL PHTHISIS. Varieties.—Several varieties of this affection are met with which, although they pass from one to the other, it is convenient to describe separately. 1. The pre-tuberculous stage.—In most cases of phthisis there is marked local or patchy ansemia of the larynx. Persistent or repeated attacks of laryngeal catarrh are also not infrequent and may lead to excoriation of the weakened laryngeal mucous membrane. These con- ditions are important because, from the anatomical irregularities of the larynx, accumulations of sputum tend to occur in its recesses, and the tubercle bacilli which swarm in the sputum are arrested and gain an entrance at any weak spot. 2. The single tuberculous tumour.—This is usually met with in cases of early or chronic phthisis in patients who maintain fair general health. One or occasionally two nodules may be seen, most commonly in the inter-arytenoid region but occasionally growing from the ventricular bands and more rarely from the vocal cords. 3. Superficial ulceration of the vocal cords or adjacent parts.—This is a purely intrinsic laryngeal disease and in this region the ulceration is at first commonly superficial and tends to spread but very slowly. Later it may extend in depth and even give rise to perichondritis and necrosis of cartilage. From its situation this form of the disease if accompanied by swelling or overgrowth is prone to produce laryngeal stenosis. 4. Extensive tuberculous infiltration.—The commonest and most dis- tressing form of tuberculosis is that in which the upper aperture of the larynx, the arytenoids, the ary-epiglottic folds and the epiglottis are in- volved. In this region the mucous and sub-mucous tissues are extremely lax and are very liable to become cedematous J the tuberculous infiltration is usually deep and the cartilages are often involved. The epiglottis is swollen, of a dirty greyish-yellow colour and somewhat translucent. The

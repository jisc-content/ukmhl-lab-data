AFFECTIONS OF THE SKULL. 23 of the circle is almost complete, the introduction of an elevator of suit- able size will generally force out the circle of bone, which should then be pushed under the scalp and kept there until the end of the operation. The subsequent steps of the treatment are the same as those already described j the depressed fragments of bone are elevated, the internal table is examined, and any projecting fragments are removed. Fig. 7.—Trephines. A is the modern form in common use. The crown of the instrument is bevelled, and the pin is fixed to a solid metal block a, which is kept in place by the pin b transfixing it and the crown. The handle is removed for cleaning purposes by un- screwing the nut c. B shows a somewhat similar instrument worked as a centre-bit. The crown and the pin are similar to those in the other figure, but, as the machine is here intended for rapid work, it is fitted with a guard d, which, by the agency of the screw e, regulates the depth to which the crown is allowed to penetrate. This is most useful when several circles of bone have to be removed near one another. The thickness of the first circle being ascertained, the guard is set to that, and very rapid work can be done. Arrest of bleeding.—Special attention must be paid to the arrest of any haemorrhage from the meningeal vessels ; in some cases this is much more important and difficult than the treatment of the depressed fragments. Any blood-clot between the dura mater and the bone must be cleared away and any active bleeding looked for. If blood wells up from the depths of the wound, an attempt must be made to arrest it, and this will usually entail the removal of further portions of the bone; this is most easily and rapidly done with a pair of strong Hoffman's forceps. The case at this stage very closely resembles one of extra-dural hemorrhage after the

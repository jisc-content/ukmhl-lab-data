THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE EAR. 416 brain ; in the latter case there are usually infantile convulsions or obvious mental defects. Treatment.—This depends upon the cause and no special directions can be given. Where complete deafness is present lip-reading must be taught as soon as the child becomes old enough, but where congenital mental defects are present speaking by signs must be resorted to. In meningitis the deafness is usually permanent. In fractures recovery may occur, in which case there is usually improvement within six months. In congenital deafness the prognosis is very bad unless there are signs of hearing by the time the child is five years old. This occasionally occurs and gradually improves until fair recovery may result and the patient will learn to talk. NEURASTHENIA. Persons suffering from overwork, or brain fatigue, or who have been subjected to much worry and anxiety, are occasionally subject to tinnitus without any sign of middle ear disease and without any impairment of the hearing. The noise is generally not severe and may be uni- or bi-lateral. Not uncommonly it is referred to the top or back of the head rather than to the ear. It may prevent sleep and add to the depression of the patient, and this is especially important in that these patients almost invariably suffer from insomnia and general depression. In some cases there is also impairment of hearing which examination shows to be internal ear or nerve impairment. Treatment.—This must consist in complete rest from work, in change of air and tonics. Good food with a fair amount of exercise should be tried, but in the more severe cases the Weir Mitchell treatment is indicated. Unless energetically treated in the early stages the tinnitus very commonly becomes permanent, although the general health may be completely restored.

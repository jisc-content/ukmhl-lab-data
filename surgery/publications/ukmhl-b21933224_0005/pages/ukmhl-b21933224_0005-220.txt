SECTION III.—AFFECTIONS OF THE J A WS. CHAPTER XV. FRACTURES OF THE JAWS. FRACTURE OF THE UPPER JAW. Fractures of the superior maxilla are nearly always due to severe direct violence, although in some cases the fracture may extend into the bone from the skull. Varieties.—A not uncommon form is fracture of the alveolar margin, which may be produced by severe blows, such as a kick from a horse, and may involve detachment of the whole of the lower part of the upper jaw— that is to say, the alveolus with the hard palate. In other cases the frac- ture is limited to a small portion of the alveolar border, as after the extraction of teeth. The nasal process of the superior maxilla may also be fractured in severe injuries to the nose from direct violence. When the nasal process is fractured, there is often injury to the lachrymal sac or nasal duct, and emphysema is not uncommon. Fracture of the anterior wall of the antrum may be due to blows, or, when compound, to stabs or bullet wounds. Fractures of the palate process alone are very rare, and are generally the result of gun-shot wounds or direct thrusts, such as bayonet wounds. Extensive fracture of the whole bone or of both bones together is usually only a part of some very serious injury, being most often associated with fracture of the base of the skull. When the fracture is compound and opens either into the mouth or upon the cheek, there may be very considerable haemorrhage from rupture of the infra-orbital artery, and with this there is often anaesthesia of the lip and the adjacent side of the nose from damage to the infra-orbital nerve. Complications.—The complications of this fracture are (i) epiphora and emphysema from damage to the lachrymal sac and nasal duct; (2) anaesthesia of the soft parts from injury to the infra-orbital nerve; (3)

143 THE PLASTIC SURGERY OF THE FACE. RESTORATION OF THE UPPER LIP.—When only the central portion of the lip has to be removed for disease, the removal is carried out on the same lines as that for cancer of a portion of the lower lip (see p. 120), a V-shaped incision with concave borders being made and afterwards stitched together. Where the whole of the middle of the upper lip has to be removed up to the nostril, each remaining part should Fig. 44.—Operation for Restoration of Part of the Upper Lip. In A are shown the portions of skin, a and b, removed from each side of the cheek, in order to allow the remains of the upper lip to slide inwards and meet in the middle line as in B. be freely separated from the jaws and an incision continued upwards round the ala of the nose on each side. An elliptical portion of skin is then removed opposite each ala (see Fig. 44) and the lip can then be brought together and the wound stitched up without compressing the A B Fig. 45.—Operation for Restoration of the Entire Upper Lip. . Two elliptical portions of skin, rfand e, are removed as in the preceding figure. The mucous membrane is stitched to the skin along ab and ac, and these are then drawn down to form the free margin of the new lip. The points xx in A come together at the point x in B, just beneath the columella. nostrils in any way and with extremely little deformity. The same prin- ciple may be employed for more extensive removals of the lip. When the whole of the upper lip has been removed, it is well if possible to make the operation wound as angular as possible, with the apex at the columella; an incision is then carried from the columella round the ala and up along the side of the nose on each side (see Fig. 45). The flaps are raised and an elliptical portion of the cheek is taken away on each side

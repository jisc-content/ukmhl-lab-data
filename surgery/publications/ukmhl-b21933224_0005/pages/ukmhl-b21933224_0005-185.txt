157 THE PLASTIC SURGERY OF THE FACE. pared edges of the defect. This leaves a raw surface on either side of the nose which can be covered with skin grafts. Where the cartilaginous portion is completely lost, the Indian method (see p. 158) may be employed; it was introduced mainly for these cases. Fig. 53.—Svme's Operation of Restoration of the Soft Parts of the Nose. A. The gap is pared so as to be of a triangular form, and the flap is marked out on the cheek. B. The V-shaped edges of the flap are sutured together in the middle line, and the remainder of the flap is fastened to the raw surface. The surface from which the flap is raised is filled up partly by undermining, and partly by skin-grafts. 3. Partial losses of the a/a or tip of the nose must be repaired by flaps from the cheek; it is seldom necessary to take them from the forehead. It is impossible to give details of these operations because the defects vary so much in character. The principle in most cases must be to employ curved incisions. A B Fig. 54.—Partial Rhinoplasty Operations. A. Langenbeck's operation. A skin-flap is raised from the sound ala to fill in the defect in its fellow. The raw surface left may be covered with a large skin-graft. B. The operation generally known as Denonvilliers'. The edges of the. defect are pared, and the triangular flap, which should contain the cartilage of theala, is rotated into position on its pedicle. 4. Loss of the whole nose.—The methods of forming an entire new nose are very unsatisfactory, as, in whatever way it may be made, the new organ shrinks and ultimately forms as an unsightly mass on the face. Indeed, in most cases the patient will probably be much better off with an artificial nose suitably tinted and held in position by spectacles. Two operations may be employed: in the one the skin to form the

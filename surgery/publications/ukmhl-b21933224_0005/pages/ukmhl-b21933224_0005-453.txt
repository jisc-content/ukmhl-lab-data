CHAPTER XXXIX. INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS OF THE LARYNX. ACUTE CATARRHAL LARYNGITIS IN ADULTS. Causes.—This affection usually forms part of a general catarrh of the upper air passages such as arises from catching cold and is then commonly associated with tracheitis or bronchitis. It occurs in many general affections, such as the exanthemata, more especially measles; it may also result from violent functional efforts such as shouting, or from the administration of drugs such as iodide of potassium. In individuals subject to recurring laryngitis some predisposing cause will invariably be found; the most common is chronic laryngitis maintained by an unhealthy condition of the upper air passages, by breathing an unhealthy atmosphere, general ill- health, etc. Pathology.—There is general congestion of the mucous membrane of the larynx with thickening and infiltration of the vocal cords; the latter point is important, as the exudation may extend into the muscular fibres of the thyro-arytenoideus internus and interfere with the action of that muscle, causing deficient tension of the cords. Symptoms.—These are briefly hoarseness or aphonia and a tendency to excessive cough and constant clearing of the throat. Treatment.—In itself the affection is not serious, and special treatment is therefore rarely called for except in the case of singers, public speakers, etc., in whom a speedy recovery is desirable. General.—The patient should be confined to a room at a temperature of about 650 F., the air of which is kept moist by means of a steam- kettle. He should be strictly enjoined to rest the voice; whispering only is permissible and even this should be avoided as far as possible. The diet should consist chiefly of warm fluids. A brisk saline purge, such as a full dose of sulphate of magnesia, should be given and the general treatment already described for acute rhinitis should be carried out (see p. 295). Local.—This consists in the employment of steam inhalations such as

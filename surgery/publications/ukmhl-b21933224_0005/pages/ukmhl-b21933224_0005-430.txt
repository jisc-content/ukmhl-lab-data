CHAPTER XXXVI. SUPPURATION IN THE ANTRUM AND MASTOID CELLS. SUPERFICIAL MASTOID ABSCESS. This is an abscess occurring beneath the periosteum of the mastoid process and is most common in children. It is due to extension of suppuration beneath the soft parts either from the tympanum or the antrum. The pus passes outwards through the segment of Rivini. Treatment.—The treatment consists in the evacuation of the pus through a free incision behind the ear right down to the bone. If no sinus can be found leading into the bone this may be all that is required, but if the case be one of chronic suppuration of the middle ear it is better to proceed to the complete mastoid operation (see p. 404). ACUTE SUPPURATION IN THE MASTOID ANTRUM. This most commonly occurs in connection with chronic suppuration in the antrum or middle ear as the result of some impediment to the free escape of the discharge. Less frequently it is met with in acute suppurative otitis, and especially when the latter, is due to one of the acute infectious fevers, particularly scarlet fever, diphtheria or influenza. In chronic cases the pent-up discharge spreads through the lining membrane of the cavity into the bone which rapidly becomes carious or necrosed. Thus the walls of the antrum may be perforated, allowing the pus to burst through externally and form an abscess over the mastoid process behind the ear. Less frequently the pus finds an exit through the anterior wall of the antrum into the external auditory meatus or through its lower wall into the digastric fossa. The posterior wall or roof of the antrum may also be carious and lead to intra-cranial complications. Symptoms.—There is acute pain with marked tenderness on pressure, redness and oedema over the site of the antrum and behind the ear and the auricle is displaced outwards and downwards. A prominent symptom of antral suppuration is bulging of the postero-superior wall of the external

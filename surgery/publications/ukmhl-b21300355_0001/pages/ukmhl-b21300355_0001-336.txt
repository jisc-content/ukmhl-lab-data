OF SCALDS AND BURNS. 316 an application equally advantageous, and much more convenient; relief is afforded by its immediate appli- cation, the parts are cooled ; the flour, absorbing the discharge, is soon formed into crusts, which effec- tually protect the surfifice; and the after-secretion readily escapes from beneath this, no more moisture being imbibed than is merely sufficient for the en- crustation. The artificial covering ought not to be removed imtil completely detached, by pm-ulent mat- ter accumulating beneath it; then its presence can be of no service, and its removal is accomplished by fomentation or poultice, and without pain to the patient; whereas, by pulling off the crusts shortly after their formation, as some do, whilst they are ad- herent to the surface, and protecting it from injury, much pain is given to the patient, the raw sui'face is irritated, and made liable to overaction, and a use- ful application is taken away to make room for an- other exactly similar. After the spontaneous sepa- ration, fresh flour may be again sprinkled over the suppurating surface, and, if the affected part is small, it may heal under this application. But when, in burns of considerable extent, suppuration is esta- blished, and granulations have begun to arise, lotions or ointments are to be applied, just as to any other granulating sore; and, for the reasons already as- signed, the applications require to be of a gently stimulating nature. In severe cases, there is first extreme depression of the powers of life, under which patients sometimes sink; but most frequently tliis

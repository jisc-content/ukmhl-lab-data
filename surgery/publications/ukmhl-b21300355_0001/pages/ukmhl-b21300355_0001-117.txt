THE SYNOVIAL MEMBllANES. 97 face is destroyed, it is irregularly flocculerit, and; frequently of a light yellow colour ; in some cases it. is softened, in others it is indurated, and sometimes of a semicartilaginous consistence. The interarticular adipose tissue also seems to be increased in volume, from being infiltrated with a serous fluid, by the discharge of which the diseased blood-vessels have attempted to relieve themselves. When the inflammation has been intense, or of long duration, lymph is secreted, and deposited on the external surface of the membrane, forming an intimate? union between it and the ligaments, and producing thickening of the external apparatus. Or the lymph' is also effused on the inner surface of the membrane, to which it adheres and becomes organized ; and this organized effusion is often so extensive, as to conceal; almost the whole of the synovial membrane, excepting portions of its delicate reflexions which invest the- articulating cartilages. By the lymphatic deposit, to Si, less degree, the folds also of the synovial membrane adhere to each other, whereby the motion is still far- ther impeded,and the pain, when attempted, increased., Occasionally the synovial membrane is found enor- mously thickened, much softened in texture, and of a brown hue, when the disease has been of a very chronic character. Along with these appearances, serum is generally found effused, in a greater or less quantity, into the cellular tissue exterior to the liga- mentous covering. If the inflammation have termi- nated in suppuration, purulent matter will be found within the joint, and its quantity will vary according G

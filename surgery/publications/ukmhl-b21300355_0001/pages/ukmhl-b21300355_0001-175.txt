AFFECTIONS OF THE ARTERIAL SYSTEM. 155 the artery being contracted towards the constriction. Inflammation is excited in the vessel, the lacerated margins of the internal and middle coats secrete lymph, by which they adhere, and so obliterate the (ianal of the artery at that point. Lymph is also effused on the external surface, and in this deposit the ligature becomes imbedded. The direct influx of blood into the aneurismal sac is thus intercepted, and time is allowed for coagulation of the blood which it con- tains ; and the artery for a considerable distance be- low the ligature becomes converted into a firm and impervious chord. The coats of the vessel above the ligature are much thickened, and the internal mem- brane is occupied with the transverse rugae occasion- ed by projecting fasciculi of muscular fibres, which are always apparent after obstruction of an artery. If this operation be properly conducted, success must almost uniformly follow. Before determining on its performance, however, the state of the arterial system ought to be examined as carefully as possible ; for not unfrequently the degeneration of the coats is almost universal, and therefore an artery, or even arteries, may be diseased at more points than one ; and if this aneurismal diathesis exist, the patient may be found to labour under an internal aneurism of the aorta. In. such a case, success from any operation, for the cure of the external aneurism, can never be expected ; and there is also no inconsiderable danger of the patient's death being suddenly accelerated by the operation, the sac of the internal aneurism giving way during

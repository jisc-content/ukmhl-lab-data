18 OK INFLAMMATION. we find the secretory organs not only differing from one another in secreting power, but each exhibiting alternate periods of repose and activity. It has been long known, and universally admitted, that the ves- sels supplying an active organ are unusually loaded with blood. The question then arises, AVhat is the cause of the greater influx of blood ? Can the heart instantly direct a stream of blood to any organ that may require it, without at the same time transmit- ting a corresponding increase to all the others ? Such a supposition is evidently absurd. These, and many other phenomena of the animal economy, are quite inexplicable, unless we admit that particular vessels have the power of dilatation and contraction, of directing and impelling the blood to particular organs ; and if certain arteries have this power, how can we refuse a like power to the whole of the arterial system ? Alternate contraction and dilatation do not seem to occur to any great extent, however, in the larger arteries, during healthy circulation, nor is it neces- sary that it should ; and though they are cajiable of dilatation, and may be called on to dilate or contract under some circumstances, jet the circulation is occasionally maintained for a considerable timfe, when these vessels are almost incapable of such action. Independently of muscular action, the arteries may greatly influence the distribution and speed of trans- mission of the blood, by enlarging and diminishing their calibres ; that is, by merely becoming larger and smaller conduits.

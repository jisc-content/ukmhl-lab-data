OF TUMOURS. 203 Sometimes the contents are vesicular, and in such cases the cyst is usually dense and firm. In many encysted tumours, hairs grow from the internal membrane of the cyst, often numerous, and are generally found in those situated on the eyelids; in some the hairs are destitute of bulbs, lie loose within the tumour, and are often rolled into a globular form. The adhesions of these tumours are in general very slight and easily broken up, but when seated amongst tendons, or in unyielding parts, they are often extremely firm. Violent inflammatory action may follow injuries of the tumours, or the making of minute openings into them; suppuration occurs, the discharge is thin, foetid, and often bloody; there is much pain, and frequently severe constitu- tional irritation. Occasionally, a fungus, bleeding or not, is protruded through the aperture; more fre- quently, however, the opening heals, and the tumour remains as before. External injuries sometimes ap- pear to check the secreting action, and to excite the absorbents to remove the morbid growths, and this with or without rupture of the cyst. Thus, in the case of an encysted tumour the size of a hen's egg, on the external lateral ligament of the knee joint, free and pretty rough manipulation was necessaryto ascer- tain its nature and exact situation; in consequence of which, the tumour gradually disappeared, and no traces of it remained twelve days afterwards. Others, of less size, I have known to disappear in a much shorter period.

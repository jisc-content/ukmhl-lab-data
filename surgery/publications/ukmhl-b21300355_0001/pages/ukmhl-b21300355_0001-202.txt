OF TUMOURS, 182 matter, exactly resembling the substance of the tu- mour. The fungus which protrudes after ulceration of the integuments, sometimes bleeds ; when it would appear that the haemorrhage proceeds from thosei )bloody collections in the substance of the tumour already mentioned ; for, according to my experience, •when bloody points, or cysts containing bloody fluid, .exist in a medullary or other tumoul* which has been •removed, and if the diseased matter be reproduced, a bleeding fungus will certainly follow. This species of tumour occurs in all ages and in all situations, and during its progress evinces strong proofs of inve- terate malignancy; if removed early, the disease may be arrested ; but if the operation be long delayed, a tumour of a similar nature, and more extensive, will almost invariably be produced. In several instances I have removed encephaloid tumours, from the situa- tion both of the mamma and testicle, and the disease did not return ; but in the other cases, the result has been as above stated. Encephaloid disease of the internal organs frequently supervenes on that of the external parts, and accelerates the patient's dissolu- tion ; when in such situations, they ai-e beyond the reach of surgical art, and their existence is only, if at all, ascertained, in order to enhance the unfavourable nature of the surgeon's prognosis. Adipose tumours, when irritated and inflamed, may, as formerly noticed, degenerate into an encephaloid nature, and present the same appearances with morbid growths encepha- loid from the first, with this difference, that they retain their lobukited structure^

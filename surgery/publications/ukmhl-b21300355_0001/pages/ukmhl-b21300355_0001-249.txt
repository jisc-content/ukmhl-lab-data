229 OF WOUNDS. have begun to act; they throw out coagulating lymph, and continue to do so until their secretion has com- pletely filled the. vessel immediately opposite to its divided margins ; thvis a third and more effectual coa- gulum is formed,â€”one of lymph, situated between the external and internal coagula of blood, and in general closely adherent to them. Lymph is also effused externally to the artery and its sheath, forming a dense stratum, which separates the extremity of the vessel from the external wound ; it becomes organized, forms granulations, and thus the parts are consolidated, and the wound cicatrized. When the artery is permanently obstructed by the adhesion of its cut margins, the external coagulum can be dis- pensed with, and is gradually absorbed. Afterwards all the newly formed parts are condensed, and dimi- nish in size ; the artery contracts, its internal surface finally embraces the coagulated blood which lay loose in its canal; its coats appear to be thickened, and it is firm and hard. Ultimately, in consequence of the continuance of absorption, it becomes much more at- tenuated, so as scarcely to differ from the surround- ing cellular tissue. Similar changes occur in the lower extremity of the divided artery ; in general it retracts farther, its orifice is more contracted, and, the flow of blood being much less profuse than in the superior, the natural means for its temporary closure are sooner accomplished. When an artery has been divided close to the origin of a collateral branch, no bloody coagulum can form internally, for the blood

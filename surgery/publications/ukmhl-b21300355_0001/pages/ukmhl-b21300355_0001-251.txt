231 OF WOUNDS. The effusion continues, and a false aneurism is form- ed. If a considerable part of the circumference has been divided, the lymph may be, and generally is, superabundant, and often to such an extent as to close up the canal of the artery at that point; but if the aperture is minute and in a longitudinal direction, lymph will seldom be effused in greater quantity than is sufficient for the cicatrisation, and though it should be superabundant, it is afterwards removed by the absorbents. In all cases, the cellular tissue round the wounded point is much thickened and conden- sed by the deposition of lymph, but this gradually disappears after cicatrisation has been completed. Sometimes, and generally when the wound has been transverse and large, the process of adhesion is dis- turbed, and suppuration occurs ; in this case the wound in the vessel communicates with a fistulous track in the externally effused lymph, and may be the source of troublesome haemorrhage. In other instances of extensive transverse wounds, the undi- vided slip ulcerates, and the artery becomes oblite- rated, by means of the same natural processes that occur in complete division. In cases of laceration of an artery, when its coats have been forcibly torn rather than divided, little or no bleeding takes place. The vessel retracts ; the lacerated margins of its inner coat become puckered up, so as to greatly contract the orifice of the vessel; the sheath is lacerated, and presents a very irregular surface, on which portions of blood are retained and coagulate; in short, the immediate effects of the injury are such, as to cause

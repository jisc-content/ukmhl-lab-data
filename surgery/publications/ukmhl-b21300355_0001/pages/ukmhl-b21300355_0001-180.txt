160 OF INFLAMMATION, &C. and the coats of the artery be sound at the deligated point, the occurrence of secondary haemorrhage must be rare. It generally supervenes when the ligature is about to separate; at first there is a thin bloody discharge, and afterwards the quantity of blood is more copious, evacuated at first in a gentle and con- tinued stream, but afterwards per saltuiiiy and in profusion. The discharge not unfrequently stops for a short time, but, on the circulation being excited, it again returns, and the patient soon dies, unless active measures be practicable, and immediately resorted to. Compression can be of no use, nor can venesection. The application of a ligature betwixt the heart and the open point of the vessel afibrds the only chance of saving the patient; the surgeon must interfere, and do what is in his powerâ€”he cannot look on and see the patient bleed to death. Occasionally the aneurismal sac deviates from its usual structure and appearance. Sometimes osseous or calcai'eous matter is found deposited, to a greater or less extent, in the substance of the parietes of the sac, or between the laminae of fibrine which it contains. The tumour may also occupy unexpected situations, occurring after fracture of the bones and laceration of an artery, and perhaps from more slight external injuries. A disease of bone, somewhat resembling an aneurismal state of that tissue, will be afterwards considered.

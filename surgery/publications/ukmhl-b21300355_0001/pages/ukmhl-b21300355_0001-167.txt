AFFECTIONS OF THE ARTERIAL SYSTEM. 147 ciimstance that tumours not aneurismal receive a pulsatory movement from an artery or from arteries immediately beneath them ; such difficulty is obviated by attention to this simple testâ€”that in an aneurism the pulsation is felt equally in all directions. Besides, if the tumour is movable, it can be partially displaced, so as not to lie immediately over a large artery, and if it is not aneurismal, it will be found to possess no pulsation ; if it is an aneurism, its pulsation will not be diminished by any change of position. The blood contained within the aneurismal sac being comparatively motionless, coagulates, and the coagulum is attached to the inner surface ; at first it contains red globules, and is of a red colour, but it afterwards loses the globules, and becomes of a pale hue, consisting solely of fibrine. This coating gra- dually increases, and attains no small thickness, fresh portions of fibrine being superadded in concentric laminae. These laminae are chiefly deposited from the blood within the cavity, but they also receive addition from lymph being effused by the vessels proper to the original parietes of the tumour. By such thickening, it can be easily conceived that the pulsation will be somewhat lessened. It is not, however, diminished to any great extent, for absorption of one or more points occurs, and the coating is again attenuated. In some rare cases the deposition of fibrine has gone on gradually accumulating, filled completely the aneu- rismal cavity, restored the course of the blood to its former channel, and thus effected a spontaneous cure, the remaining solid tumour imperceptibly diminishing

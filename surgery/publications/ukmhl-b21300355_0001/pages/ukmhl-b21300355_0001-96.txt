OF ERYSIPELAS. 76 skin perspirable. Under this treatment, every vestige of erysipelas will generally disappear in the course of two days. In more severe cases, especially in the extremities, the parts must be freely incised. The incisions ought to extend through the integuments and cellular substance, and their length and number must be proportioned to the extent and severity of the affection. Some have disapproved of long incisions, alleging that they are tedious in healing, and prefer making numerous small ones; but it is difficult to under- stand how the cure should be more tedious in the one case than in the other, when the actual extent of divided surface is the same. According to my experience, several free incisions heal as soon as nume- rous small ones, whilst by the former the purpose of the practitioner is much better fulfilled; the same good effects result from them as from punctures in the more slight cases, if they are made at the com- mencement of the disease ; and if the affection is in its advanced stage, the effused fluid, and the sloughs, ai'e discharged, and the infiltration of pus, and destruc- tion of parts in consequence of the matter being con- fined, are prevented by its being allowed a free exit as soon as it is formed. Incisions then are made both in the early stage of the disease, and after eflusion has occurred : in the former case, they are justifiable, because they arrest its progress; in the latter, they are absolutely necessary, to prevent its injurious effects. The parts are to be fomented, and afterwards covered with a common poultice, containing no oil or grease.

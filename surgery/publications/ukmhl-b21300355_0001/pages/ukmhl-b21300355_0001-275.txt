255 OF WOUNDS. it follows a superficial course, its track is marked by a wheal, or elevation of the skin with discoloration. At one time, it was believed that the most serious consequences resulted from a ball passing close past the body, and without touching it—that in this way violent concussion of the brain, proving instantly fatal, was produced ; but this notion has been dis- proved by experience ; part of the head accoutre- ments, qf the hair, of the nose, and of the ears, have been shot away by cannon-balls, and yet no disturb- ance of the brain has followed either immediately or consecutively. The opinion originated from the cir- cumstance of soldiers having been found dead without any evidence of injury; but bones are often broken and comminuted by an indirect blow, or by a spent ball, without any breach of surface or external sign remaining; internal injuries indeed—rupture of vis- cera—more than sufficient to cause instant death, are thus inflicted without any apparent external Isesion. The course of a ball in the body is often very strange, depending on the force with which it is projected, or the resistance which is opposed to it, and on the position of the struck part. Balls often pass almost completely round the head or chest, having first struck the bone at a very oblique angle. Frequently they remain, lodged along with part of the clothing which they thrust before them. In such cases, they may be immediately removed, their exact situation being previously ascertained by external examination, or by means of a probe. They can generally be extracted through the aperture by which

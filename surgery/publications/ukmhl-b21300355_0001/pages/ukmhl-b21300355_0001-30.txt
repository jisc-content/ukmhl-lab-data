ON INFLAMMATION. 10 cause, and the kind of texture primarily affected. The functions both of the sanguiferous and nervous systems are deranged, producing a state termed Symp- tomatic or Sympathetic Inflammatory Fever. All the secretions and excretions are diminished or sup- pressed ; and hence the hot, dry state of the skin, the thirst with foul and dry tongue, the urine scanty and high coloured, and the constipation of the bowels. This last symptom, however, though it may arise partially from the diminished secretion of mucus, yet is often dependent on disturbance of the functions of the brain and nerves. The pulsations of the arteries become rapid and strong, the sanguiferous system being unable to relieve itself by eflfusion in conse- quence of the obstruction of the exhalants. If the extreme vessels are in any way obstructed, and the general circulation in consequence much accelerated, the internal viscera become oppressed, and are interrupted in then* functions ; and relief is experienced only when relaxation occurs in the vessels upon the surface of the body. Thus, in any violent exertion, there is a sense of oppression in the chest, and the functions of the encephalon are somewhat disordered, but as soon as perspiration breaks out, the relief is instantaneous, and the animal can, with- out difficulty, continue its exertions. In inflammatory fever, the breathing is often diffi- cult, and the appetite declines ; the patient is restless and watchful, and when he does sleep, he is not thereby refreshed. In the more violent cases, the sensorial functions

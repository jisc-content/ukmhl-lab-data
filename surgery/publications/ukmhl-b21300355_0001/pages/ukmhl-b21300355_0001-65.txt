By the continued presence of purulent matter, ab- sorption, ulceration, caries, and even death, of bone, is frequently produced, all which would have been prevented by its timeous evacuation.

The abscess at length gave way externally ; but the patient was at the same time seized with profuse expectoration of pus, and during expiration the air escaped through the external openings in the neck.

209 OF TUMOURS. and on being freely handled, is found to crepitate, in consequence of the loose spiculse of bone rubbing upon each other. Ultimately, the integuments be- come tense, livid, or dark-red, ulcerate, and allow a portion of the softened tumour to protrude, in the form of a frightful fungus ; there is profuse discharge, thin, and sometimes bloody; there is much constitutional irritation, and the patient is greatly exhausted. Not unfrequently, during the progress of the disease, especially in the long bones, fracture- occurs at the diseased part, from either external injury, or sudden muscular exertion ; the fracture does not unite, the rough and loose ends of the bone are a cause of much irritation, inflammatory action is kindled in the morbid structure, suppu- ration occurs, the integuments give way, and ulce- rate to a greater or less extent, and the advance- ment of the disease is much hastened. The tu- mour may be safely pronounced malignant; it is true, that for some time it shows no tendency to in- volve the adjoining soft parts, further than by the effects of inflammation induced by its pressure ; but then, it is limited by the external lamina of the bones, which confines it to the tissue in which it origina- ted ; but after this barrier has given way, the tumour projects through the aperture, contaminating the adjacent soft parts, imparting to them a morbid action, and extending in the cancellated tissue of the shaft of the bone. In some cases, the integuments are tense and discoloured, with large vessels running on their surface, the tumour feels soft and fluctu- o

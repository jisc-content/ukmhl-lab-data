OF ULCEUS OF THE GENITAL OKGANS, &C. 283 Of Ulcers of the Genital Organs^ and their Consequences. It were unprofitable to enter here upon the His- tory of Venereal Affections, as it is a subject of no practical utility, still involved in uncertainty, and mystified by disputation. It will suffice to describe the diflferent forms of the disease, and state the treat- ment applicable to each. During the last century, and in the beginning of this, much greater ravages were ^jroduced by the disease than now; and its growing mildness, though partly owing to a change in the poison itself, is mainly attributable to a concomitant mildness in the mea- sures by which it has been, and is, opposed. Every form of the affection, as soon as it appeared, was opposed by a counter poison, mercury ; and the prac- titioner, relying implicitly on this mineral as a speci- fic, and being unaware of its dangerous properties, continued to gorge the system with the supposed re- medy, subverting the constitution of his patient, ma- king in many cases no impression on the disease, but changing the antidote into a poison equal, if not more potent than the one which it was intended to destroy. This last result has been propitious to our science and to mankind. But let it not be inferred that mer- cury now is, or ought to be, entirely dismissed from the treatment of this disease, or in practice generally : often no other means are effectual; but it should al- ways be prescribed most cautiously and sparingly.

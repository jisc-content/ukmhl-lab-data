In many circumstances it is highly necessary that a certain degree of incited action of the vessels should occur, and continue for a certain time ; as du- ring the uniting of fractures, the adhesion of wounds, and the healing of some soresâ€”and thus far it is liealthful: when, however, it advances to inflanima-

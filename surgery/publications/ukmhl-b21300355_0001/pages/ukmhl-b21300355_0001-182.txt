It is much increased on the general circulation being hurried, as by crying in children, by fits of passion, by the excitement of ardent liquors or venery, and during or before the menstrual discharge. On such occasions the surface frequently gives way, haemorrhage ensues,and is often profuse; and in females it may seem to take the place of the regular discharges.

Again, in children, the surface of the tumour is not unfrequently ulcerated, even to a great extent, without J^asmorrhage occurring; when such is the case, the ulceration for the most part extends, with surrounding induration and condensa- tion of the parts ; the whole of the adventitious tissue is thereby destroyed, granulations of a healthy cha- racter are formed, the parts cicatrize, and a sponta- neous cure is accomplished. In other cases, though the structure scarcely seems diseased, there may be frequent and most violent haemorrhage. A ha?mor- rhagic tendency also occasionally occurs in affections of a different nature, a trifling sore pouring out blood on the slightest touch. In some constitutions, leech- bites, pricks with pins, extraction of a tooth, &c. are attended with a dangerous haemorrhage. The cause, or causes, of aneurism by anastomosis are unknown.

OF WOUKDS. 242 number have been applied, the stitches are with- drawn, being no longer necessary. No other dress- ing is required unless suppuration occur; the rib- bons will adhere firmly till the completion of the cure, and thus the pain and irritation caused by fre- quent dressing is avoided. Even the largest wounds, as after amputation, are treated in this manner, with the most satisfactory results. If at any part adhesion fail, suppuration and gra- nulation must follow. The adhesion may be jjre- vented by any of the circumstances already men- tioned, or by an unfavourable state of the constitu- tion, the nature of the wound, exposure to bad air, the occurrence of fever, or of a flux natural or not. The wound may contain foreign matter, blood or the contents of canals may be effused into it, and many other obstacles may exist to retard, or prevent adhe- sion. Notwithstanding, in all cases, though the chance of union be but small, the parts should be approximated. A great point is gained if certain parts only are brought to adhere, for by their na- tural attachments the opposite siu'faces are preserved in more direct contact than they could otherwise be, and thereby but little space remains to be filled up with granulations. If, on the contrary, the surfaces are not approximated, the flap is diminished in size, and when afterwards placed in contact with the sur- face from which it was detached, it is found not to correspond, leaving considerable deficiency to be re- paired by the comparatively slow process of granu- lation. Whereas, if it had been early replaced, par-

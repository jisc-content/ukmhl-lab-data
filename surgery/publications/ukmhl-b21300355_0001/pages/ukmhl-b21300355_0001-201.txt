Along with these local symptoms, there is a com- plete subversion of the system,â€”there being at first symptoms of constitutional irritation, afterwards those of hectic and extreme exhaustion. When the lymphatic glands^are diseased, the limb beneath is much swollen from oedeniatous effusion, the return of the blood and lymph being prevented ; violent and excruciating pains are experienced in the course of the nerves of a limb; it also frequently loses its sensation, from those organs being either involved in the disease, or pressed on by the tumour. The vessels in the neighbourhood of the affected parts are mate- rially altered, though they are seldom converted into encephaloid matter ; the arteries are often completely obstructed by coagulating lymph for a considerable extent, and the coagulum not only occupies the prin- cipal trunk, but extends into the minute ramifications ; and this explains why haemorrhage seldom occurs,even after ulceration of the tumour is far advanced; the veins also are frequently obstructed in a similar way, but in many cases they contain a soft and pulpy

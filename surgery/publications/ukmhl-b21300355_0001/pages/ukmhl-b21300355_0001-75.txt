55 ON MORTIFICATION. part can support. The mineral acids may be useful in checking the inordinate perspiration ; opium, as- tringents, absorbents, &c. in arresting the diarrhoea; but all are of little avail unless the exciting cause is removed, and to this latter circumstance the atten- tion of the practitioner ought therefore to be chiefly- directed. Mortijication, or the death of a part, is also one of the results of inflammatory action, and the term has been subdivided into Gangrene and Sphace- lus. Gangrene is that state in which the larger arterial and nervous trunks still continue to perform their functions ; a portion of the natural temperature remains, and the part may be supposed still capable of recovery. Sphacelus, again, expresses complete death, when, putrefaction being no longer resisted, the part becomes black, cold, insensible, and foetid; but, in general, the distinction between the terms is not strictly attended to. A division of more importance is into humid and dry, or traumatic and chronic, gangrene ; humid or traumatic being applied to mor- tification produced by external injury; dry or chronic to that resulting from a constitutional cause. Mor- tification is sometimes preceded by incited action of the vessels, sometimes not. Humid or traumatic gangrene frequently occurs without previous inflammation, the injury being so severe as at once to deprive the part of its vitality. Dry or chronic gangrene is often unpreceded by inflammatory action.

168 OF INFLAMMATION OF VEINS. The cause of this affection is obstruction to a free return of the blood; by means of tumours, either adventitious, or in the case of pregnancy, constipation, &c.;. or by the tight application of a ligature round the limb, as of a garter. It often occurs in those who have been in the habit of great muscular exertion, the blood being thereby forced from the deep-seated veins into the superficial. The lower limb is perhaps the most common seat of the disease ; when the veins in this situation are dilated, the valves are insufficient to obstruct the calibres of the vessels, and conse- quently the lower and smaller veins have to sustain the column of blood in the superficial veins of the whole limb, its weight not being diminished by the support, which, in the natural state of parts, is afibrded by the valves; thereby the disease is aggravated. The left limb is generally the one affected; and this circumstance may probably be explained by the pres- sure of the sigmoid flexure of the colon on the left iliac veins. In many cases, the treatment must be only pallia- tive. The limb must be used as little as 2)ossible, and, if practicable, be kept in a state of complete rest; and the veins must also be sujjported by the applica- tion of a bandage, or the wearing of a laced stocking ; in some instances, the application of cold has been of advantage, promoting the contraction of the dilated vessels. When pregnancy is the cause, it is needless to commence any method of cure, until the cause he removed; and the same remark is applicable when the affection arises from constipation. In certain

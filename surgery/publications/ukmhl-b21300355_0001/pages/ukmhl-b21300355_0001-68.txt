ON SUPPURATION. 48 the potassa fusa, may be frequently employed with advantage for opening chronic abscesses, especially when they are the consequence of glandular enlarge- ment, and undermine the integuments, which show no tendency to adhere to the subjacent parts. The potass is always to be used in the solid form, and not in paste, as is sometimes practised. By its appli- cation the unhealthy surface is destroyed, and the surrounding parts are stimulated so as to assume a sufficient degree of action to throw off the portions which have become useless, and to form new and healthy granulations, whilst the sui'rounding effusion of lymph or serum is for the most part speedily absorbed. But it can never be employed in acute abscesses without aggravating the disease; and in collections which are deeply seated, it cannot be of much service, for in these a considerable thickness of healthy parts must be destroyed, and if the potass be applied, it will afterwards be necessary to cut through the slough, as was practised by the older surgeons, in order to evacuate the matter and give relief to the patient; or else to continue the application of the caustic for an inordinate space of time, which is a practice altogether unnecessary, extremely cruel, and productive of much irritation, constitutional as well as local. A too common result of abscess, I mean when inertly treated, is the formation of a Smus; that is, a long canal, the circumference of which is condensed and lined with solid lymph, and discharges un- healthy purulent matter, frequently thin and gleety. 8

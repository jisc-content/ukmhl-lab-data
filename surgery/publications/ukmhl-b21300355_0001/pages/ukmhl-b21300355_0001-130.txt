110 OF COXALGIA, MORBUS COXAUIUS, ease. They are frequently the subjects of inflamma- tion of an acute character, but in most instances the action is of short duration, and generally terminates in an increase and accumulation of the secreted fluid. The attendant pain is very severe, and much increa- sed by any motion of the neighbouring parts. Occasionally a portion of condensed cellular sub- stance assumes the appearance of a bursa, secretes a similar fluid, and is similarly affected in consequence of inflammation. Disease of the bursae may occur from external injury, and often they become affected subsequently to disease of the neighbouring joint. If the action is violent, lymph is effused on the inner surface, or external to its cavity, causing considerable thicken- ing. Occasionally the action terminates in suppu- ration, pus being effused to a greater or less extent â€¢into the cavity; and if allowed to remain or accumu- late, the abscess extends, and frequently communi- cates with the neighbouring joint, which may not have been diseased. In chronic cases of enlarged bursae, especially of the bursal thecae of the tendons of the wrist or ankle, we not unfrequently meet with loose cartilaginous bodies, of various sizes, and of a flattened oval form, floating in the accumulated fluid. They have been supposed to be formed by portions of lymph having become detached, and being much condensed in structure. When inflammatory action has commenced, it must be subdued by copious topical bleeding, along with the exhibition of purgatives; in most cases general blood-letting will not be required.

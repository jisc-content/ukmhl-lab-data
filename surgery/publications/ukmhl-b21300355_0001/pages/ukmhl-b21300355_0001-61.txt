ON SUPPURATION. 41r. Tumours formed by the enlargement of glands are frequently productive of dangerous consequences. If situated in the neck, they may render breathing and deglutition extremely difficult, and in the event of their suppurating, the purulent matter may be dis- charged into the trachea or gullet; fatal results have followed the giving way of an abscess into the former canal. The breathing is also seriously impeded by enlargement of the bronchial glands, by the pressure of which the lungs may be much condensed, and un- fitted for their functions; and if the tumours suppu- rate, the matter is eventually discharged either into the cavity of the pleura, producing empyema, or into the bronchia, causing, in many instances, speedy suf-. focation. The immediate effect of enlargement of the mesenteric glands, is interruption to the circulation of the chyle, and a consequent decline of the powers of life. Such tumours in the abdomen have been mistaken for enlargement of the liver, spleen, ova- rium, &c., and the most noxious treatment employed. Glandular enlargements terminate either in reso- lution, in delitescence, or in suppuration ; seldom in death of the part. When the tumour, after having attained a certain size, gradually disappears, it is said to be resolved ; when, however, it is rapidly discussed, it terminates in delitescence ; the difference between the terms being the same as when used to express the corresponding terminations of an inflammatory swelling. Suppuration is by far the most usual termination, and the matter is frequently evacuated through nu-

174 OF TUMOURS. which precedes the formation of a tumour, is chiefly met with in the cellular and glandular structures. It has been confounded with oedematous swelling, but from this it differs, inasmuch as the infiltrated mat- ter is in the former solid, whilst in the latter it is fluid : sometimes it is described under the term of oedema solidum. In the scrotum, where the cellular tissue is remarkably loose and extensile, such tumours attain a very large size. They are found in this country, though more frequently in warm climates. I removed one from this situation which weighed upwards of 44^ lbs.; it had been of twelve years' du- ration, and caused much inconvenience to the pa- tient. It occurs in the mamma, apparently in conse- quence of suppression of the menstrual discharge ; the gland becomes enlarged, there is no pain in the tumour, and it feels soft and doughy. When the sub- cutaneous cellular tissue is the seat of the disease, the tumour is often of considerable extent, but rarely forms a great protuberance. It sometimes is situated in the coverings of the nose, which, as they become enlarged, lose their natural colour, and assume a purple hue; the mucous follicles also are often much enlarged, and occasionally emit a profuse discharge of their secretions. It can be readily understood, that in this situation the tumour is a source of much an- noyance, from its partially obstructing respiration, and even vision, and interfering with the meals of the patient. It has been already observed, that when simple en- largement exists for some time, the structure changes.

OF TUMOURS. 172 nieiice. Occasionally tumours partly resemble the texture in which they grow; those of a fatty nature are frequently found to have their nidus in the adipose tissue; cartilaginous tumours project from the arti- culating surfaces of the bones of a joint, or are sub- sequently detached,and lie loose in its cavity; growths of a cellular structure internally, and invested by an apparently mucous lining, protrude from the surface of mucous membranes. Others differ, not only from the texture in which they are situated, and from which they derive their nutritive vessels, but also from every other part of the healthy structure. In one instance a congenital tumour was composed of an aggregation of numerous materials, many of them Resembling the healthy textures of the body. The simple tumour is mei'e enlai'gement of a part, from the infiltration of solid matter deposited by its blood-vessels. There can be little doubt that the action which lays the foundation of such enlargement is inflammatory: In consequence of inflammation of the tissue, lymph is effiised into the cellular substance during the progress of the incited action; and after it has subsided, the dilated and debilitated vessels pro- bably do not regain their condition, as to size and vigour, but remain somewhat dilated, and continue to free themselves from portions of their contents; thus the cellular tissue is opened out in proportion as the infiltration advances, and the process may be occa- sionally accelerated by fresh attacks of subacute in- flammatory action. The patient at first feels pain, lieat, &c., as in an inflammatory tumour ; these after-

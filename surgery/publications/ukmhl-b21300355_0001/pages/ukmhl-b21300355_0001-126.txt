In some a few leeches may be applied, and followed by counter irritation, with advantage. The employment of coun- ter-irritants is, perha,ps, chiefly to be trusted to in the treatment of chronic affections of the joints. Of these, blisters are most in use ; though, from my own experience, I cannot much recommend them. Their constant repetition is exceedingly annoying, and the slow progress which is made towards a cure under their use is far from encouraging.

Caustic issues have been much praised, and are often highly beneficial; an eschar is made by the caustic potass applied to the skin, or by rubbing the muriate of mercury, or any other caustic, into scari- fications made by the lancet; the slough separates, and pus is discharged; and instead of promoting a continuation of the discharge, by applying savine ointment, or other irritating dressings, it is better to allow the parts to heal, and then to repeat the application of the caustic.

23 ON INFLAMMATION". sympathize with the part affected, and, acting with greater vigour than usual, propel the blood into the extreme branches ; so that the inflammatory excite- ment may be said to be gradually communicated by the continuous sympathy, till the whole sanguiferous system become subject to its influence. The degree of this general excitement depends greatly on the texture and function of the part primarily affected. The term Passive Inflammation has been applied to that state in which the larger vessels are not excited, or have ceased to sympathize with the capil- lary branches. The term Chronic Inflammation is properly limit- ed to the consequence of the acute inflammatory action, the part remaining turgid and swollen, and the vessels over-distended with dark blood, but with little or no pain, and without heat or throbbing. Congestion is also employed to denote fulness of the vessels, large as well as small, when no sign of excited circulation, or of decided inflammatory action, has occurred. It is most frequently used, however, when describing the condition of an internal organ. An overdistension of a particular set of vessels may cer- tainly exist, as a consequence of inflammation, or alto* gether unconnected with it, and still be unattended with inflammatory action. These two states ought to be carefully distinguished from a similar condition of the vessels, attended with inflammation ; for practice, which Avould be beneficial in the one case, is highly prejudicial in the other. Lamentable examples of the uonattention to this distinction are every day observed.

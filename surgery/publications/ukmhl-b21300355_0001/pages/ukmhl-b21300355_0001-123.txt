103 OR HIP-JOINT DISEASE. frequent startings of the limb during sleep, accom- panied with fever, and other symptoms of severe constitutional disturbance. By these symptoms, and the profuse discharge, which may be evacuated froni several openings round the joint, the patient is much exhausted, and often sinks. In some instances the spontaneous cure by anchylosis occurs; or when the femur has been dislocated, the disease sometimes gradually abates, and a sort of new joint is formed ; and occasionally the limb, after some time, becomes useful to the patient. In many cases, the appearance which the various parts of the diseased joint present, are similar to those which have been already described when treating of affections of the joints generally. Frequently, how- ever, the osseous tissue in this situation is much more extensively affected. Often the whole cartilage on the head of the femur is completely removed, exposing the bone in an ulcerated condition; and when the system has long borne up under the disease, the greater portion of the head, neck, and even of the trochanter, is destroyed, the extremity of the bone being completely altered in form, and composed of a loose, spongy, cancellated structure. A similar disorganization occurs in the acetabulum; the carti- lage is often wholly removed, and the margins of the acetabulum absorbed, merely an ulcerated depression being left for the reception of the diseased femur ; in other instances the margins remain unaffected, whilst the ulceration proceeds in the centre, and the cavity is thereby much deepened. Not unfrequently the

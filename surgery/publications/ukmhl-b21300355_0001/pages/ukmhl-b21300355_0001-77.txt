57 ON MORTIFICATION. crum oris, for example, and sloughing of the puden- dum in children, occur in those of the poorer classes who live in low, damp, and dirty situations ; and no incited action precedes the sloughing. Mortification, to a greater or less extent, may be produced in any constitution, and at any age, by the application of heated substances, caustics, acids, &c.; by the effusion of acrid matter into the cellular sub- stances, as urine or foeces ; by the interruption of the circulation and nervous energy, as from ligatures or improperly applied bandagesâ€”or by natural stric- tures, as those in hernia and paraphymosis ; by long- continued pressure; and by violent contusions, as in fractures, compound luxations, and gunshot injuries. A frequent source of mortification, in inclement sea- sons and climates, is exposure to extreme cold. In this case, the cold is not the direct, but the indirect cause ; the power of the parts is very much weakened by exposure to the low temperature, and is thereby rendered incapable of resisting the incited action which follows the stimulus of sudden transition from cold to heat) even though the degree of increase in temperature should not exceed that of the natural standard. That cold is not the direct cause of morti- fication, has been undeniably proved by facts derived from military practice. No symptoms of inflamma- tion or gangrene occur when the soldier is on duty, and continuously exposed to severe cold ; but they speedily present themselves after a rapid thaw has commenced, or after the soldier has imprudently ap- proached a fire.

ON SUPPTJHATION. 38 of parts of the body which have either mortified, or otherwise become useless to the system. In suck collections, more especially if deeply seated, the matter generally seeks the surface, or extends in the course of the blood-vessels. As formerly remarked, suppuration occurs much more readily in some constitutions than in others; and patients peculiarly liable to the formation of ab- scesses, without any great degree of previous excited action of the blood-vessels, are said to labour under Struma or Scrophula. These terms are by some used to denote a distinct or specific disease, while others consider them merely as a pai-ticular state of the constitution. The strumous diathesis is said to be marked by hair and irides of a very light colour, and by the skin being of a peculiar white hue; but, in some in- stances, the complexion is unusually dark and sal- low. The upper lip is generally of a swollen ap- pearance, as also the columna and alae of the nose. The organization throughout is delicate, and the patient is frequently of a handsome, though infirm, structure. Constitutions, in every respect strong and vigorous originally, may from various causes become weak, and present many of the symptoms usually termed scro- phulous. I recollect a young patient, who had en- joyed excellent health, and had been born of healthy parents, becoming covered with ulcers and chronic abscesses, in consequence of exposure to cold diu'ing menstruation.

There is no ten- sion,â€”the pain is not throbbing, but of a burning or itching kind, and there is often a degree of oedematous swelling. Swelling does not occur to any great extent, however, during the existence of the inflammation in the skin and rete mucosum ; but the parts sometimes become much swollen after subsidence of the inflam- matory action, the vessels having relieved themselves by effusion of serum ; and afterwards the oedematous surface often assumes a yellowish hue.

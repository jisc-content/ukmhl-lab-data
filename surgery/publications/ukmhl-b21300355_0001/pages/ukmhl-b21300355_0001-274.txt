254 OF WOUNDS. inflammation subdued, tension relieved, abscesses opened, sloughs removed, &c. General bleeding is seldom admissible, but purgatives and antimonials will prove beneficial at the commencement; after- wards the strength is to be supported, and, if the patient be much reduced, stimulants are to be libe- rally administered. We shall next treat briefly of Gunshot wounds; under this head are included the contused and the lacerated, caused by splinters, &c. The vitality of the injured surface is generally destroyed at once, whence bleeding seldom occurs, even after whole limbs have been shot awcty ; in some cases, haemor- rhage is profuse, as when a large artery has been wounded by small shot. The effects on the system are extremely various; some persons are aflected with tremors, anxiety, and depression Â£i*om slight wounds; while the most severe injuries are often unaccompanied with any disturbance of the nerves. The shock is generally of short duration, disappear- ing soon, on the patient's being reassured and en- couraged, or after his taking a little wine or opium. In gunshot wounds, those inflicted from a distance and close at hand can in general be readily dis- tinguished. In the latter the wound is large and lacerated, portions of the wadding are impacted, and the skin around is marked with grains of gunpowder. In the former, the wound is small and clean. When a ball passes through a fleshy part, the opening at its entrance is small and depressed ; whilst that by which it escaped is open, with everted edges. AVhen

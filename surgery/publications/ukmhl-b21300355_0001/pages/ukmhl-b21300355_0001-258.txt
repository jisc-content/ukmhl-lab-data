or WOUNDS. 238 faces are placed in immediate contact; but there is no breach of surface, and adhesion does not occur till the tunic has been divided by ulceration; then the opposite margins cohere, the vessel is obliterated, and undergoes changes resembling those in an artery similarly circumstanced. The coagulum between the ligature and extremity is of considerable extent, dense, and completely filling the canal of the vein, and con- sequently, of a cylindrical form. The edges of the wound, in the soft parts, ought not to be approximated till the bleeding have entirely ceased, and the surface become glazed, for the inter- position of a quantity of blood prevents union by the first intention. When bleeding has ceased, its edges are to be brought together as accurately as possible, and adhesion promoted. The minute vessels assume an action greater than in the healthy, though not equal to the inflammatory ; they effuse coagulating lymph, by which the opposed surfaces are aggluti- nated, though the union is at first feeble and easily broken up. Soon the lymph is firmly attached, by newly formed vessels, to the surface from which it was secreted; in effect, it becomes organized, and rendered capable of undergoing, through its inherent powers, the changes necessary for its perfection and stability. Similar processes go on in it as in any sound part of tlie body ; new matter is deposited, and the superfluous is absorbed. Nutrition, however, is not the same in all parts of its substance, that is, the new matter dejjosited is.not exactly similar at all points; but according as the new secreting vessels

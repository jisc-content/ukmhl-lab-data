*0N INFLAMMATION. 3 tion, it must, for this reason, be considered morbid, that it frustrates the healing process of nature. The first symptom of inflammation to be consider- ed is Redness; this is observed only on the surface of the bodv, or at the extremities of those canals which terminate externally. The inflamed conjunctiva affords a conspicuous example of this appearance. And, in a subject that has suffered from an internal inflammatory attack, a good opportunity is frequently afforded of observing the enlarged and injected state of the vessels on which the red colour depends. But inflammation may have existed to a certain degree, and yet the parts may be pale, from the capillaries having emptied themselves into the veins immediately after the patient's death. The paleness may be also in part caused by the in- flux of the red globules being impeded immediately after death, or when the patient is in articulo mor- tis, in consequence of the contraction of the vessels, which is well known to occur at that period. But it must also be noticed, that redness is not essential to inflammation; for serous vessels may be altered in size and function by this action, and yet not be sufficiently dilated to receive the red globules of the blood,â€”as is exemplified in inflammation of the arachnoid membrane of the brain, and slight in- flammation of the cornea, &c. But, again, serous vessels may be enlarged, so as to admit the red globules; and a part that is colour- less when in the healthy state, may assume a highly red hue when in an inflamed condition. This may

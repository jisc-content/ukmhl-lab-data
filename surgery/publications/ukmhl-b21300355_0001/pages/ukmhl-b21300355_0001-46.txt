26 ON INFLAMMATION. the natural standard, as will afterwards be more particularly illustrated. But the inflammatory ac- tion may be produced, even though no heat be af- terwards applied directly to the part, by its vessels being too rapidly brought into a similar degree of action with those of the surrounding parts which are in their natural condition. Sudden and general diminution of temperature seems to act as an exciting cause, by producing an instantaneous suppression of the transpiration. Another exciting cause of in- flammation, is the retention of the secreted fluids, causing unnatural distension of canals or cavities, and is exemplified by cystitis occurring in consequence of retention of urine. Certain states of the constitu- tion are justly supposed to excite inflammation, in particular textures. Other exciting causes of inflam- mation might be enumerated, but these will be more naturally explained, and more fully considered, whilst treating; of inflammation of the various tissues and organs. Their effects are various and diversified, according to the intensity of the cause, the structure, function, and sympathies of the part affected, and tlie state of the system. And it is also to be remembered, that not unfrequently inflammatory action appeal's, whilst we can assign no cause for its production. . Inflammation is said to terminate in Resolutlony Suppiiration, and Mortification. The application of the word termination, however, is injudicious ; for in general the inflammatory action is not suspended by the occurrence of suppuration or mortification, but continues in the surroundiug parts with unabated

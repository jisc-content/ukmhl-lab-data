OF WOUNDS. 259 in deciding on the removal of the pai't by amputation, —or on making an attempt to save it, by trusting to, and assisting, the processes of nature. The question whether to amputate immediately, and on the spot, merely allowing the shock, if any exist, to pass away, or to delay till suppuration occur, is now scarcely a matter of dispute. When it is evident, from the extent, violence, and nature of the injury, that there is danger of speedy mortification, or of extensive and severe inflammation and suppuration, amputation is to be instantly performed,—delay is inadmissible. In comminution of the hard, with contusion and laceration of the soft parts—where limbs have been shattered and completely detached, or nearly so—in lacerations of parts, including the principal blood-vessels and nerves—fractures of the heads of bones, with openings into the joints—and in bad compound fractures, more especially of the thigh, (for all compound fractures of the upper part of the thigh are dangerous,) amputate at once. When the limb has been retained, and gangrene arises in con- sequence of the external injury, and not from an internal cause; or when the violence of inflamma- tory action has subsided, and the patient is become hectic, with profuse purulent discharge, and with disunited bones, then amputate. But in this latter case, the chance of recovery is not great, and the proportion of resources very small; whereas, in the immediate or primary operations, the very reverse holds true. Such is the experience of military sur- geons. In civil practice, the results are different; a

ON SUPPURATION, 31 ' It appears that the stimulating substance produces an incited action of the blood-vessels, or a revulsion, according to the older authors, in the part to which it is applied; and that, consequently, the neighbour- ing arterial trunks, in order to sustain that incited, action, supply the part with a larger proportion of their contents than it usually receives ; and the neces- sary consequence of the stimulated part receiving an additional supply of blood, is, that the part originally inflamed receives less. In fact, the effect seems ana- logous to that of topical bleeding, with this difference .â€”that it is more permanent. But it must be borne in mind, that this method is not to be resorted to in the commencement, or during the active state, of the inflammatory action, but only when that action has begun to decline, otherwise the disease may be much aggravated, instead of being- relieved. If, notwithstanding all the raieiail's employed to pro- cure resolution, the inflammatory action continues unabated, the result next to be desired and accelera- ted is Suppuration; and with this view, it becomes necessary to change the treatment, both local and general.

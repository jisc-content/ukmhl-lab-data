156 or INFLAMMATION, AND OTHEE its performance; such circumstances have actually occurred. Ligatures composed of animal substance, such as catgut, have been proposed as preferable to all others, on the supposition that they would be absorbed, and occasion less irritation; the fallacy of any such theory has already been adverted to. After the ligature has been applied for some time, it induces ulceration of the external coat which it envelopes, by which means it becomes detached from the vessel, and acting as a foreign body, and causing a slight degree of suppuration, is brought by nature to the surface and discharged. The period at which it separates may be said to be from the tenth to the twentieth day ; sometimes sooner, seldom later. If, however, much of the surrounding parts has been included along with the vessel, a longer period will elapse before the separation of the ligature. One end only of the ligature should be cut away close to the artery, the other being left protruding through the external wound; as thus the extraneous body, when detached, can be readily pulled away. 'WTien both ends are cut short, there is a risk of secondaiy haemor- rhage, from the ligature causing formation of matter round the vessel, and ulceration of its coats. The operation ought to be performed at as early a period of the disease as possible. Some recommend that it should be delayed in recent cases, with the view of allowing sufficient time for the anastomosing vessels to enlarge, supposing that the circulation of the blood will thus be more vigorous in the smaller

114 OF INFLAMMATION OF BONE, continuity in the skin is repaired by the production of a cutaneous substance; in muscles, the repairing substance comes to resemble the muscular tissue; and in like manner new bone is deposited by the vessels of the old. If it is asserted that those of the perios- teum are the repairing or secreting vessels, we may, with equal propriety and truth, attribute reparation of the skin to muscular blood-vessels, and vice versa. When bone is extensively affected with inflamma- tion, motion is impaired ; the muscles being displaced and retarded in their action by the swelling and irregularity of the substance of the bone ; and perhaps also by their partaking, in some measure, of the in- flammatory action ; so that any attemjjt to move the parts very much aggravates the patient's suffering. Occasionally inflammation attacks almost all the bones in the body, and producing great constitutional disturbance, as well as exhausting the powers of life, soon terminates fatally. Bones are liable to be inflamed from various causes; and, from whatever cause, the action ends, as in the other tissues, in resolution, suppuration, or mortifica- tion. The effusion by which the diseased vessels naturally relieve themselves in softer textures, cannot here take place so readily or to such an extent as to prove beneficial; the intensity of the action is with difficulty subdued, and, consequently, resolution is comparatively rare ; when it does occur, the parts do not soon regain their natural condition, but often remain considerably swollen and indurated ; as is seen in nodes, which continue duriiTg the life of the patient.

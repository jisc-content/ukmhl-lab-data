OF ERYSIPELAS. 74 observed, however, in patients whose constitutions have been extremely debilitated. In mild cases of erysipelas, attention to the state of the bowels, and regulation of diet, will often be sufficient to remove the disease. When there is much disorder of the digestive organs, and particu- larly of the biliary secretions, emetics may be given at the commencement; these are productive of but little good in the more advanced stage, and their place is advantageously supplied by nauseating doses of antimony, combined or not with purgatives. Such medicines tend to subdue any arterial excitement that may exist, evacuate the bowels, promote perspiration, remove the superabundant bilious matter, and serve to restore the healthy functions of the liver. In severe cases, more especially of phlegmonous erysi- pelas, in which there is acceleration of the pulse, and a degree of febrile excitement, general bleeding may be had recourse to ; but it must be employed with caution, for the symptoms of increased vascular action may arise from constitutional irritation, and not be meliorated by the depletion. In very many cases, the strength is from the first to be supported by all possible means, by nourishing d'l^t, by the exhibition of wine, quinine, and other tonics ; more particularly in old people—in constitutions debilitated by disease—in unhealthy situations, and when the fever is of the typhoid kind. Bleeding by leeches is not admissible, for the leech-bites prove a source of irritation, and are liable to suppurate ; erysipelas has often been produced by leeching.

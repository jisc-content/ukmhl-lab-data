AND DISEASES THENCE ARISING. 115 ^vithout causing pain or much inconvenience; and when deposition of new bone has occurred to a consi- derable extent, the limb may diminish somewhat in size, but seldom, if ever, regains its former shape. Suppuration in the surface, or in the centre, and partial or total death of a portion, of bone, are the most frequent consequences of external injury or in- cited vascular action; and suppuration in the cancel- lated texture frequently follows very slight incited action in those of a scrofulous habit. Suppuration in bones is necessarily connected with loss of substance, and condensation of the surrounding parts ; and puru- lent collections exteriorly, if allowed to press long, or if bound down by unyielding sheaths, will sooner or later produce a breach of continuity, by causing ab- sorption of the outer lamella and the subjacent cancel- lated texture. A similar effect is produced by aneu- rismal and other tumours. Such loss of substance is, in some instances, speedily repaired, after removal of the cause, by effusion of new matter from the surround- ing blood-vessels of the bone ; thus, in disease in consequence of pressure from aneurism, we frequently observe that the healing process commences as soon as the aneurisraal sac begins to diminish. But, as has been already observed, the healthy actions are more vigorous in the softer tissues than in bone, and when ulceration has occurred in the latter, it is generally attended with weak action, and presents the same general characters as an ulcer in the soft parts, con- nected with a feeble action of the blood-vessels ; the discharge is thin and foetid, absorption gradually ex-

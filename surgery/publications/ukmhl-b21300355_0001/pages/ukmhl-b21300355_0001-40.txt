These larger trunks propelling blood into the distended and comparatively inert capillaries, which are incapable of transmitting into the veins the same quantity of fluid which they re- ceive, will cause the throbbing or pulsating sensa- tion. In inflammation, it appears that a denser and darker-coloured blood is admitted into the vessels, and that red blood passes into arteries which could not receive it previously. The part, if transparent, becomes opaque—there is redness, pain, throbbing, swelling, and heat,—in fact, inflammation is esta- blished ; and though the cause be now removed, the consequent action will run its course. The blood circulating in the part is changed in quality; it is redder, flocculi appear floating in it, and the globules disappear. These last may ha^^ been broken down in passing to the minute vessels, or partial decompo- sition may have taken place from a loss of vital power in the vessels themselves. It is more probable, however, that the globules ai'e merely condensed, for whenever motion is pro- duced in the flitid, tliey speedily reappear. The alteration in the Component parts of the blood seems to depend upoii the previiius statle of the inflamed vessels in which it is Contained ; for it soon reassumes its natural appearance, when brought iilto a healthy

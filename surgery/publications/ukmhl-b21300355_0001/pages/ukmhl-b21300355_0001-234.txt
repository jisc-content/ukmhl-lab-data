OF TUMOUllS. 214 pitation was distinctly perceived, as if from fracture of osseous spiculcE. A tumour was first perceived about three months previous, situated immediately below the spine of the scapula, about the size of a filbert, of a flat form, and attended with distinct pul- sation ; it had subsequently increased with great rapi- dity. About ten days before his admission into the hospital, it had been punctured ; nothing save blood escaped. It was evident from the rapid growth of the tumour, and the severity of the symptoms, that the patient would soon be destroyed if no oj)eration were attempted. There were no signs of evil in the thoracic viscera, the ribs and intercostal muscles were unaffected; though the tumour was finnly fixed to the scapula, yet that bone was movable as the one on the opposite side, and the vessels and nerves in the axilla were quite unconnected with the swelling. The operation was commenced by making an incision, from the axilla to the lower and posterior pai*t of the tumoui'. The latissimus dorsi was then cut across at about two inches from its insertion, so as to expose the inner edge of the tumour, with a view to tie the subscapular artery in the first instance; in this, however, I was foiled, owing to its depth. I then proceeded to dissect, where I expected vessels to enter from the suprascapular ; and in detaching the tumour from the spine of the scapula, I felt my fingers and knife dip into the tumour. This was attended with a profuse gush of florid blood, with coagula; by a sponge thrust into the cavity, the haemorrhage was in a ^reat degree arrested ; at the same time an at-

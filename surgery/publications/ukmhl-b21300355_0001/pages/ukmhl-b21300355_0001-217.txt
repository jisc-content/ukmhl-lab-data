197 OF TUMOURS. It is not connected with any large nervous trunk; but minute nervous fibrillae can be readily traced expand- ing on its surface, and apparently entering its sub- stance. Internally it is composed of numerous whitish fibres, of considerable density, ramifying irregularly throughout its structure ; and betwixt these is insi- nuated a firm substance, generally of a grey colour, and frequently of an almost cartilaginous consistence. Such is the structure most frequently observed; but in this morbid formation, as in all others, the appear- ances may be said to vary in almost every instance. Sometimes the fibres are indistinct, and of a yel- lowish or dirty grey colour ; and the interfibrous matter is often found to vary in density and colour in different tumours, being at one time dense and almost transparent, at another, opaque and cartilagi- nous, and sometimes rather soft, brownish, and occa- sionally tinged with blood. From attentive examina- tion, it appears extremely probable that the enlarge- ment is at first produced by infiltration of lymph be- twixt the fibrillae of a nervous twig, which become separated and enclosed by the deposit—that they afterwards increase in size—that the interfibrous matter is deposited in greater quantity, and is farther condensed—and that thereby the nervous filaments are stiU more separated and extenuated. In short, it would appear that the fibrous matter is nervous, though altered, and that the interposed substance is organized and condensed lymph. The tumour, at first extremely minute, enlarges slowly ; when deep, it can only be obscurely felt, and its existence is with

257 OF WOUNDS. long in the dense cellular cyst which forms over them, without producing pain or inconvenience. Besides, the bones are often splintered by the force with which they are struck, and loose portions of them lodge amongst the muscles; then they are the cause of much mischief, for, on account of their long, sharp, and irregular form, they occasion great irrita- tion, suppuration ensues in various parts, sinuses form, and the cure is rendered very tedious. In other cases, the bone is split in a longitudinal direc- tion, and, in the cylindrical bones, these fissures are often of great extent. Considering the nature of the body which inflicts the injury in a gunshot wound, and the force with, which it is impelled, it is evident that the cure must be in all cases tedious, in consequence of the slough- ing and suppuration which is induced, particularly at the apertiu'es through which the ball passed. The foreign body ought always to be removed as early as possible, provided it can be accomplished without much violence, or injury to the parts. Dilatation of gunshot wounds is now had recourse to only to faci- litate the removal of balls, splinters, &c., and even with this view, it ought to be employed but to a very slight extent, if at all; for foreign substances, when deeply seated, can be much more easily taken out when the sloughs are separating, and the parts re- laxed by suppuration ; then, too, they can be more readily reached through a counter-opening, when their situation renders this expedient. In short, the surgeon is not justified in cutting for balls, imless R

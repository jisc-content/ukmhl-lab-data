52 ON SUPPURATION. tity of gaseous fluid. The discharge of blood probabljr arises from the usual support being taken away from the vessels ramifying on the surface of the cavity, in the same Avay that blood is effused into the cavity of the abdomen, in consequence of the too rapid evacua- tion of the serum in ascites. Such consequences may be in a great measure prevented by the gradual and continued pressure of a properly applied compress. Suppuration, more especially when extensive and long continued, is attended with a peculiar species of fever termed Hectic. This fever is the remote con- sequence of local injury, or disease, whereas symp^ tomatic inflammatory fever is the immediate one. In long-continued disease, particularly internal, the hectic occasionally occurs without suppuration, or before it has commenced; and it does not always supervene upon suppuration, even though extensive. By many it has been supposed to arise from the absorption of pus ; and although in not a few cases there maybe circumstances which support this theory, still, in some instances, pus appears to be absorbed without the occurrence of hectic fever. Thus, ab- scesses occasionally disappear, in consequence of speedy absorption of their contents, whilst this event is not followed by any unpleasant symptom ; and in large sores, attended with profuse suppuration, there is every reason to believe that pus is absorbed, though no hectic ensue. Hectic fever is most apt to arise in constitutions originally weak; and usiudly either from some incu- ral)le disease of a vital organ, or from extensive affec-

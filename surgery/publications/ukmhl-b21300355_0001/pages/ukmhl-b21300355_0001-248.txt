OF WOUNDS. 228 ged, whilst they present an irregular surface, on which the blood continues to be deposited and to coagulate; and thus the aperture in the sheath is ultimately clo- sed. This external coagulum is found to commence at the extremity of the artery, where it is of a cylin- drical form, and shuts up the mouth of the vessel; it then extends along the canal in the sheath, fre- quently assuming a conical form; and if a free dis- charge has been allowed for the blood, it will termi- nate at the cut margin of the sheath, otherwise it will be found continuous with the coagulum blocking up the external wound. Also, when haemorrhage has been resisted by the shutting of the external wound, blood is infiltrated into the cellular tissue around the bleeding point, and there coagulates ; but this cir- cumstance can be productive of little or no pressure on the parietes of the vessel, so as to assist those other means which obstruct it. The flow of blood through the divided vessel being prevented, the cir- culating fluid necessarily passes through the nearest collateral branches, leaving the blood in the extre- mity of the larger trunk in a state of comparative rest; consequently, coagulation occurs in this situa- tion. The internal coagulum, however, is small, and not sufficient to occupy completely the cavity of the vessel; it is of a conical form, its apex being towards the heart, and opposite to the first collateral branch, and its base resting on the external coagulum, and there adhering to the internal surface of the artery. But whilst this latter process is advancing, the capil- lary vessels supplying the cut margins of the artery

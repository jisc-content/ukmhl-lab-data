■ OF ANEURISM BY ANASTOMOSIS. l6l Of Aneurism hy Anastomosis. This disease is generally seated in the external cellular tissue. It has been supposed to attack occa- sionally the internal organs; and a case is related, in which it was situate in the cellular tissue, between the vagina and rectum. Frequently the congenital marks of children, termed Nsevi, seem to degenerate into this disease: occasionally it occurs in sound skin and in adults. The colour of the tumour is a dark red, or inclining to purple ; it is irregular on its sur- face, and has a soft spongy feel. Often it is raised distinctly above the surrounding parts; at other times it is flat, scarcely prominent, and seems to enlarge chiefly in a lateral direction. Pulsation, in some instances, is felt; often, however, the tumour is of an inactive character, affords no feeling of pulsa- tion, and, on being handled, feels like a doughy elastic intumescence, appearing to be composed of a conge- ries of distended vessels, resembling varix, in which the blood circulates slowly. The tumour is formed by enlargement, tortuosity, and increased activity of the neighbouring vessels ; in some cases the arteries are chiefly affected, in others the veins. That such is its structure, can be distinctly proved by dissection —the vessels are found enlarged to many times their natural size, and their coats are much attenuated; it is not of a cellular structure, as some have sup- posed. Its tissue is similar to that of the corpora L

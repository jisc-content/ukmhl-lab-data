158 OF INFLAMMATION, AND OTHER only have I found it assume a more permanent and troublesome aspect; in that case, it recurred about ten months after the performance of the operation, but speedily disappeared under the careful use of a band- age. On account of the aneurismal diathesis, it occa- sionally happens, that after the cure of one aneurism, another appears in a different situation; in two in- stances, I operated on both thighs, successively and successfully, for popliteal aneurism, in the same pa- tient. When the tumour is so situated as not to admit of the application of a ligature between it and the heart, it has been the practice to place the ligature on the distal side of the aneurism, upon the supposition that coagulation will occur within the sac in this case as after the common operation. The practice has been made trial of, and its expediency and success appear very doubtful; the post mortem examinations have as yet been very unsatisfactory. The application, indeed, of a ligature in that situation can seldom be of any advantage, the artery being already obliterated a long way beneath the tumour; and it is perhaps from this circumstance, that, in such operations, great diffi- culty has been experienced in secui'ing the vessel, and that surgeons have been obliged to pass their needle under a thick mass, somewhat in the situation of the artery. It would appear, in some instances, that the artery had even remained intact. The appearance of the vessel after the application of a ligature above the tumour has been already shown. The obliteration of the sac proceeds, in some cases, very rapidly; it assumes a harder feel, decreases.

29 ON INFLAMMATION. flammatiou speedily subsiding. If the cause cannot be removed, or if, after its removal, the inflammation proceeds unabated, the arterial action must be redu- ced by general and local abstraction of blood. By general depletion, the action of the whole sanguiferous system is diminished, as well as of those vessels more immediately engaged in the morbid action; but the affected capillaries are still dilated, and less capable than the larger trunks of effective contraction to pro- pel their contents ; and are therefore only sufficiently depleted by the local abstraction of blood, by leeches, cupping, punctures, or incisions. Blood may be drawn either from arteries or from veins. In Ai'te- riotomy, the blood is discharged more rapidly, and its flow is of longer continuance, than from a vein, so that the system may thereby be almost complete- ly deprived of its circulating fluid; and perhaps a more speedy impression may be made on the inflam- matory action. Perhaps the only objection to vene- section is, that after frequent and copious venous haemorrhage, the internal vessels become gorged with blood, and a disposition to apoplexy is induced. But bleeding is not to be had recourse to without due consideration of the age, strength, constitution, and idiosyncrasy of the patient; if employed, it must be modified according to these ; and it has already been mentioned, that depletion is not always to be perse- vered in on account of the presence of the buffy coat. Bleeding is materially assisted in reducing the ac- tivity of the circulation, by the employment of saline purgatives, along with nauseating doses of antimony.

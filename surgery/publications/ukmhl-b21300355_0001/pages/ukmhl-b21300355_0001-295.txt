OF HOSPITAL GANGRENE. 275 It may break out at any season, but hot and sultry "Weather is most favourable to it. No breach of surface, however small, is secure from its attack. The wound becomes painful and swollen, and loses its healthy, florid appearance; the granulations are flabby, and appear as if distended with air ; vesicles form, containing serum or a bloody fluid; the pain is stinging; the secretions are suspended; and the wound is either altogether dry, or covered with slimy tenacious matter. An ichorous discharge follows, the pain increases. The sore assumes a circular form, and its edges are everted; erysipelas attacks the surrounding integuments, often extending over the whole limb, and forming a principal feature of the disease. In fact, violent erysipelas and hospital gangrene are affections very closely allied to each other, often arising at the same time, and from the same causes. Both are accompanied with great con- stitutional disturbance ; but in erysipelas it precedes, whilst in hospital gangrene it follows, the appear- ance of the malady. The lymphatic glands, in the neighbourhood of the gangrenous part, inflame and suppurate, the skin gives way, and the gangrene soon seizes the newly-formed sore.

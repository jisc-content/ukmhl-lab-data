THE SEROUS MEMBRANES. 85 chronic inflammatory action. When the inflammation is violent, and consequently rapid, considerable quan- tities of lymph are effused either above or below the membrane; and the lymph subsequently becoming organised, the membrane is much thickened, and a stricture is formed. The functions of a part lined with mucous membrane are more or less deranged in consequence of the vitiation of the secreted fluid. In inflammation of this tissue, metastasis is also apt to occur, from one part of the membrane to an- other, and from the membrane to the external sur- face. The passages, the internal surfaces of which are invested by a mucous membrane, are those subser- vient to respiration, nutrition, generation, and the urinary secretions ; in other words, the mucous sur- faces are the Pneumogastric and the Genito-urinal. Their particular diseases will be treated of in the second part of this work. Of Inflammation of the Sei^ous Membranes. On such an extensive subject it is unnecessary to enter fully; not that the enquiry is uninteresting, or that a knowledge of the diseases of the internal cavi- ties, and the mode of treating them, is not required of the surgical practitioner before he can enter into practice, with safety to his patients and comfort and satisfaction to himself, but we have a very important class of diseases to bring under review in a limited

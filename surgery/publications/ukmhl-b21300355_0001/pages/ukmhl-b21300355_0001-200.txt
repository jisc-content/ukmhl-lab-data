180 OF TUMOURS. most frequent seats ,of this disease; it not iinfre- quently occurs in the lymphatic glands, and no texture can be considered as exempt from it. The part at first enlarges slowly, but afterwards the disease advances with great rapidity, involving the adjacent parts. In general, the affection is not attended wdth much pain; the part has a spongy and elastic feel, and frequently presents a sense of fluctuation, indica- ting that softening is more or less begun. The skin is tense, generally brownish, and is pervaded by large venous branches; this venous enlargement is always observable in the advanced stage of the disease, before or after ulceration has taken place; it is peculiarly evident in the eyelids, when the contents of the orbit are involved, and is to be attributed to obstruction of the circulation in the deeper vessels. The tumour is increased by the surrounding parts assuming a similar action, and being converted into a similar mass ; and the disease also seems to be propagated by means of the absorbent system, and by the irritation conveyed along the vessels which emanate from the tumour, or from its immediate vicinity. Thus, when the testicle or mamma is affected, the lympliatic glands, both above and below the tumour, are converted into an encephaloid mass, all traces of their glandular structure being completely destroyed. A^'^lieu the disease has been of long duration, the superincumbent integuments appear tense, assume a purple colour, ultimately ulcerate ; a portion of the pulpy mass then protrudes, of a fungous appearance, the resistance being at that point removed, and the compressed

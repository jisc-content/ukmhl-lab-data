OF TUMOUllS. 215 tempt made to compress the subclavian failed, on account of the arm being much raised to facilitate the dissection in the axilla. The patient, exhausted, made some efforts to vomit, and dropped his head from the pillow, pale, cold, and almost lifeless. Then only I became aware of the nature of the caseâ€”nothing but a bold stroke of the knife eould rescue the boy. Withdrawing the sponge, I by one rapid incision com- pletely separated the upper edge of the tumour, so as to expose its cavity; and, directed by the warm gush of blood, immediately secured with my finger a large vessel at the upper corner, which with open mouth was pouring its contents into the sac. With my right hand I then removed the coagula, and, dissecting un- der my finger, separated the great subscapular artery, so that an aneurism needle was passed under it at its origin from the axillary, and about an inch from the sac. After securing this and two other large vessels which supplied the cavity, I dissected off the tLimour from the ribs without farther haemorrhage, cutting the diseased scapula and the under part of the sac. I then found it necessary to saw off the ragged and spongy part of the scapula, leaving only about a fourth part of that bone, containing the glenoid cavity, processes, and half of its spine. The edges of the wound were brought together, and the patient lifted cautiously to bed. At this time he was pale, almost insensible, and without any pulsation percepti- ble through the integuments, in the greater arteries, though the ends of the vessels in the wound beat very forcibly.

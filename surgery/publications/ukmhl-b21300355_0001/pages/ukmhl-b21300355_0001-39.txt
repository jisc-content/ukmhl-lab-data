19 ON INFLAMMATION. Considering the arteries, then, as muscular tubes, performing an indispensable part in the propulsion of the blood, we will now briefly consider their state in inflammation. Passing over the different theories of error loci, spasm, &c. which have at various times been enter- tained, let us first examine the condition of the capil- â€¢lary vessels, for these are primarily and principally .concerned. The balance of the circulation is destroyed, but a diversity of opinion has existed as to the precise na- ture of the change which occurs. It has been sup- - posed that the circulation is much accelerated in the capillary vessels of an inflamed part; but it has been satisfactorily proved by experiment, that after in- flammation is fairly established, the blood circulates more slowly than in the healthy state of the vessels. When a part is excited, the circulation is accelerated, and a greater quantity of blood is transmitted by its vessels ; but if the excitement is speedily removed, they recover themselves, though perhaps a little dila- ted, and no inflammation ensues. But if the exci- ting cause is applied for a sufficient length of time, the extreme vessels lose their contractility, they are weakened, become dilated, and the contained blood circulates slowly^ Wiben inflammation is fairly estar Wished in a part, the capillaries become considerably dilated, but there is no proof that this change is in any way connected with debility. It is probable that the permanent dilatation occurs in consequence of the larger vessels in the immediate vicinity being in-

73 OF ERYSIPELAS. dually declines, along with the swelling, and the part regains its usual appearance, the skin remaining loose and shrivelled. If it occurs after vesications have formed, the effused fluid is absorbed, a scab forms, and desquamates along with portions of the cuticle. It may terminate in suppuration, when the inflam- mation has extended to the cellular substance. This termination is most frequent when the disease is situated in an extremity, seldom when in the face, though small purulent collections occasionally form under the eyes. Circumscribed collections of pus seldom, if ever, follow erysipelatous inflammation; but the purulent matter is diffused through the cel- lular tissue, and is of a thin, unhealthy appearance, and mixed with sloughs of the cellular substance. By the infiltration of matter, the integuments, fasciae, and muscles, are extensively separated from each other, in consequence of which the parts frequently die, their nutritive supply being cut off". Acrid sanious matter is often infiltrated extensively into the subcutaneous cellular tissue round a wound or sore. The superimposed integuments are of a dark brown colour, and the part is boggy. Sloughing of the cellular membrane takes place in consequence of the infiltration, and not from inflammatory action having been there established. The affection has been termed Diffuse Cellular Inflammation, but a more proper appellation is Diffuse Cellular Infiltration. Erysipelas, if properly treated, will seldom termi- nate in gangrene. This termination is occasionally

New bone is deposited in the concavity of the curve, at first in irregular masses, but after- wards becoming condensed, and assuming a more regular form, the column is supported and strength- ened. Bending of the spine backward, with depression of the spinous processes, is extremely rare. But cur- vature forward, with projection of the spinous pro- cesses, is by no means uncommon, and is generally supposed to be caused by caries of the bodies of the vertebrae ; in many instances, however, it arises from interstitial absorption. Curvature from caries of the vertebrae seldom happens; and though it certainly does occur in children, still it is by no means so frequent in them as in adults. It is attended with the forma- tion of purulent matter, which points in the loins, at the top of the thigh, or near the anus; and the bones may become affected secondarily in consequence of the formation and accumulation of purulent matter in their neighbourhood. There is pain in the loins, the patient walks in a stooping posture, and often com- plains of pain in the knee or thigh. The lower limbs become paralytic, as also the sphincters and extremi- ties of the hollow viscera ; this, however, may arise, without curvature, from softening of, or effusion on, the chord, or diseased thickening of its membranes. In palsy from injury of the spine, there is more or less excitement of the urinary and genital organs, deposi- tions in the bladder, priapism, &c. In some cases the palsy supervenes slowly; at first the patient has an awkward gait, he lifts his feet high to avoid

The dressings may be left undisturbed for the space of a month ; at which period, and in many cases sooner, they will be found much slackened, in con- sequence of the swelling being greatly reduced. By repetition of the application at intervals, the disease will, in a great many instances, rapidly cease, and the joint resume almost its natural appearance ; but the period at which this takes place will be found to vary much according to circumstances. If, however, the plasters produce such irritation as to cause a return of inflammatory action, their use must be dis- continued till such action have been subdued by the usual means. If the thickening of the external parts has occurred to such an extent as to cause immobility of the joint, or if partial anchylosis has ensued, the limb may be brought to the most convenient position, by the cautious use of a splint retained by the bandage. The practitioner is not to be deferred from having recourse to the above practice, even when matter has collected and burst externally, for often, b)^ its em- ployment, the cavity of the abscess contracts rapidly; and on removing the first dressing, the external open- ing is found cicatrized.

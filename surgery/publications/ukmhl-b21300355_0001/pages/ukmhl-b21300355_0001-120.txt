100 or COXALGIA, MORBUS COXATIIUS, been leeched, poulticed, blistered, and burnt, and that, too, when the knee was not at all altered in appear- ance, and showed no symptom of disease. Again, and particularly in adults, the limb is easy only in certain positions, and cannot be moved without great suffering; pain is also complained of in the groin, and often immediately behind the trochanter major. ' If an examination is made when the patient is thus halting, and even though he complains of no pain, the limb is found shrunk, wasted, and length- ened. The elongation of the limb occurs from swell- ing of the parts composing the joint, and from incli- nation of the pelvis towards that side. The length- ening is often great, and its extent is ascertained by accui'ate comparison of the two limbs, laid in contact when the patient is in the recumbent posture. When the patient stands, the affected limb is con- siderably advanced before the other, on which the weight of the trunk is chiefly supported, the knee is generally bent, and the toes only rest on the ground. During progression, the patient often moves the affected limb with the hands grasped round the thigh, and contrives that it shall support as little as possible of the weight of the body. The spine is frequently affected, becoming bent in different directions, to preserve the equilibrium of the body; and a deformity of the trunk to a great degree occurs, which, however, may be remedied, at first, by confinement to the re- cumbent position. The nates are much altered, they become flattened; and those parts which are natu- rally most prominent, are reduced to the level of the

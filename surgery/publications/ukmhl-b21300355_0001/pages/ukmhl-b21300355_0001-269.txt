In all cases, the new matter is very apt to be absorbed, either from the state of the patient's health, or from the nature of the applications ; and foreign substances in a state of solution or minute division are more readily taken into the system from the raw surface than from the sound skin. When, then, the granu- lations approach the skin, the sore contracts, the newly formed parts being modelled into a more firm and dense condition by the action of the absorbents. Sometimes, in superficial sores, the skin is seen spread- ing from several parts near the centre; but at these points portions of the original skin must have remain- ed uninjured, though the others were destroyed, and have formed cutaneous matter as soon as they were on the same level with the surrounding granula- tions ; for these insulated portions of skin are not a product of granulations, as some suppose, but of a substance similar to themselves. Skin is formed from skin. Thus, where a part of the integuments has been completely removed by operation, or destroyed by accident, no islands of skin are observed during the cure, but the sore is uniformly covered by skin pro- ceeding from its margins. The margins of a healing sore are of a white colour, and adherent to the subja- cent parts; but in an unhealthy one the margins are often unsupported, the subjacent granulations are absorbed, and their place is occupied by thin purulent matter; the new skin is unable to retain its independ- ent existence, becomes of a dark colour, and sloughs. The recent cutaneous matter covering a sore contracts,

126 OF INFLAMMATION OF BONE, The short, and the heads of the long hones, are more vascular than the flattened, and the shafts of the long. Hence necrosis most frequently occiu's in the latter. External injury may produce this disease by cau^sing a violent increase of action, and it may be so severe as at once to deprive part of the bone of its vitality. De- struction of the periosteum, and of the vessels which enter the surface of the bone, frequently gives rise to superficial necrosis or exfoliation. Such a result, how- ever, does not always follow; for we not unfrequently find, when the periosteum has been forcibly torn off, to a considerable extent, by external injury, that the part still retains its vitality. When, however, the bone has been at the same time contused, it is extremely probable that external necrosis will occm-. Again, when the periosteum has been removed in the most careful manner possible, exfoliation occasionally takes place. If the exposed bone remain of a brownish hue, it will generally retain its vigour ; if, however, the colour is white, it will most probably be cast ofi". Ne- crosis may come on at various periods of life, but is most commonly met with in young subjects, in whom the inflammatory action is allowed to make progress before it is noticed or attended to. It may affect the external or the internal part of a bone, or nearly its whole thickness. The whole of a bone never dies in consequence of increased action, and it is veiy seldom that the entire thickness of any part of it is found to be necrosed. A large portion of it, or numerous small irregular portions, may die ; but still a part of the original shaft remains, and by its vessels reproduc-

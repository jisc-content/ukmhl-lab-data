83 THE MUCOUS MEMBRANES. those malignant diseases with which carbuncle is accompanied in other climates. Of Inflammation of the Mucous Membranes. Mucous Membranes and the skin are analogous in structure, somewhat similar in function, and sym- pathize closely with each other, in health and in dis- ease. Both are endowed with that particular degree of sensibility which enables them to bear with impu- nity the impressions of foreign bodies ; and both are protected from the influence of these bodies by an inorganic covering ; the cutis and rete mucosum by the epidermis; the chorion of mucous membranes by a cuticular lining, by a mucous fluid, or by both. They are the seat of all excretions, and by them all substances are introduced from without into the sys- tem. The capillary portion of the vascular system appears to have the same arrangement in both. At the commencement and extremity of the alimentary canal, they insensibly pass into each other by means of an intermediate structure, of which the prolabium may serve as an example. In particular circum- stances, they change into each other, both in appear- ance and in function. Thus, in prolapsus of the gut or of the \Sigina, the discharge from the mucous surface subsides, the rugae disappear, the membrane becomes thickened and indurated, and gradually assumes an appearance exactly resembling that of the skin. In natural paraphymosis, the delicate membrane

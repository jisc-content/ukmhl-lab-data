AND THEIR CONSEQUENCICS. 309 originated from the venereal aifection, that cause has been removed, and the diseased actions will now pro- ceed altogether independently of their original cause. Mercury proved beneficial in removing a disease of which they are not a part but a consequence ; and if that medicine be now blindly persevered in, the only effect will be to ruin the constitution, and thereby greatly retard the cure of those affections, which, if the natural powers of the system had been merely supported, or in a great measure left to themselves, would have soon ceased to annoy the patient or alarm the antisyphilitic mercurialist.

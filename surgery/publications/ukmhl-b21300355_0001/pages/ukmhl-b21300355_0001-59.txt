ON SUPPUEATION. 39 The strumous diathesis is said to depend upon a want of balance, or proportion, between the solids and circulating fluids, or among the vessels themselves,— those containing colourless fluid becoming unusually nmnerous. Want of action and power in the organs forming and circulating the blood, disordered diges- tion, and various other circumstances which it is unnecessary to detail, have also been considered as causes of this state of the constitution. Many suppose that the diathesis, or a disposition to the diathesis, is always congenital, and this opinion is supported by the majority of cases. However, certain circumstances produce a scrophulous habit of body in patients who previously appeared to be vigorous and healtljy, and untainted with any pecu- liar disposition to'' diisease. Of these predisposing causes may be mentioned, poor diet, an impure at- mosphere, exposure to damp and cold, inattention to cleanliness, the latter circumstance acting sometimes by producing local irritation : in fact, whatever de- ranges the general health, seems, in many cases, to induce the strumous diathesis. Some constitutions are incapable of resisting any unusual incitement of the vascular system, or of repairing the consequences of the action, or of any injury, in whatever way inflicted. In such individuals, all the parts of the body are deficient in power—some, however, are more so than others, and, consequently, more readily give way; thus, the lymphatic system, the mucous membranes, the skin, the bones and their coverings, generally suffer in the first instance.

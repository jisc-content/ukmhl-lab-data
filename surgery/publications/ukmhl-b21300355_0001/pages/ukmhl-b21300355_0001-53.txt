33 ON SUPPURATION. But in some instances, no lymph is previously ef- fused, and no cyst is formed; in consequence, the matter is not confined, but pervades the cellular substance extensively, and is generally followed by more or less sloughing of the cellular tissue, and by great constitutional disturbance. This most fre- quently occurs in patients of a debilitated habit, in whom the incited action has been so slight as not to cause the effusion of lymph, by which nature usually sets bounds to the suppurating process, t , ; Pus is heavier than water, of a yellowish-white colour, somewhat of the consistence of cream, and is composed of globules, and a clear transparent fluid coagulable by the muriate of ammonia. It is said to be sweet and " mawkish to the taste." In unhealthy pus, or in vitiated mucous puriform secretion, the colour and consistence are different, and flakes resembling portions of lymph are seen floating in it; and by this latter circumstance such fluid is distinguished from the pure or laudable pus. In purulent matter also, especially that of an unheal- thy character, the existence of a quantity of sulphu- rated hydrogen is indicated by the blackening of silver probes, and of various substances applied, to the sore. Suppuration varies much in its symptoms, accord- ing to the nature of the parts involved., In general, it is accompanied with the subsidence of acute pain and fever; hut in unyielding textures, the increase^, of swelling, by the formation of purulent matter, is often attended with an aggravation of the symp-

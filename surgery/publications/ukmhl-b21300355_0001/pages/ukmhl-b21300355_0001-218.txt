When it is subcutaneous, the skin is rendered slightly prominent, and the size, density, and loose connexions of the growth, are readily ascer- tained. The slightest pressure causes the most ex- cruciating torment, and totally unmans the patient, even though induced by the most trifling movement of the adjoining muscles. From a fearful and well- grounded knowledge of this circumstance, the patient is extremely anxious to preserve the limb in a state of complete rest, and, in fact, he is wholly unable to use it; and although the part is completely set at rest, still he frequently suffers from paroxysms of severe pain, commencing in the tumour and shooting â– through the limb. Often the painful sensations ai-e very much alleviated by gentle friction with the hand. The disease is most frequent in the extremities, and in the inferior more than in the superior. The larger nervous trunks sometimes become dis- eased, being affected with an enlargenTent resem- bling the structure and appearance of the preceding tumour, and such enlargements are termed Neuro- mata. Occasionally a portion of a nervous trunk is thus enlarged, from a blow or wound; and some- times there can be no cause assigned. The disease, however, is usually met with after division of the nerves by amputation; and the former frequency of such tumour was, perhaps, caused by the practice of including artery, nerve, and a large portion of the

107 oil HIP-JOINT DISEASE. with tenesmus and bloody stools, follows its appli- cation. In some cases, the moxa is a more effectual remedy than issues formed by caustic. When swelling exists without pain, considerable advantage may be derived from frictions, and liniments of various kinds, with careful bandaging. Applications can be of little avail, unless the joint be kept completely at rest. When there is no pain in the joint, when swelling exists, with or without fluctuation, and there is every reason to believe that the extremities of the bones are not much diseased, a cure may be, in general, obtained by the employment of pressure, rest, and slight superficial excitement. But to disease of the shoulder and hip-joints this practice is not very appli- cable. The joint is well washed with soap and water, and afterwards rubbed with camphorated spirits of wine ; it is then covered with an ointment spread on lint; and* composed of equal parts of the unguentum hydrargyri cum camphora and the ceratum saponisâ€” in many cases the mercurial ointment had better be omitted: strips of adhesive plaster are then applied tightly round, from two or three inches below the joint, to the same distance above it; these are covered with soap-plaster spread on thick leather ; and the whole is surrounded with a bandage, which extends from the extremity of the limb. The bandage should be puton,as far as the joint, before the plasters areapplied. The irritation produced on the svirface tends to check the disease, whilst the compression excites the action .of the absorbents to remove the effused matter, whether lymph, serum, or pus, and thus to reduce the swelling;

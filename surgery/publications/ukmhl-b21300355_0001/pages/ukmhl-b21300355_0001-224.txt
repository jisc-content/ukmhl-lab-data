204 OF TUMOURS. OF TUMOURS OF BONES. The arteries of bones, in their healthy state, are feeble, but like other feeble parts they are irritable, and are apt to assume diseased actions of an obstinate and unyielding nature. The morbid growths vary much in texture. The most frequent are the osseous, or those of the same structure with the original bone; but even these dif- fer much in the .density and arrangement of their particles ; they have been termed exostoses. They may be of great density, and are then called the hard, or ivory; these never attain a large size, seldom exceed that of a bean, have a smooth and polished â– surface, and are of a flattened and hemispheroidal form, their greatest circumference being at the base; they occur in many of the bones, but generally in those of the cranium and face. Others, being of a more loose and spongy textiu*e, have been called cancellated. These are commonly formed by the bones of the extremities, and often attain a very considerable size. Sometimes they ad- here by a narrow neck, and expand into a bulbous form, so that they can be very readily removed by operation, and are very apt to be broken off by exter- nal injury. Others have a broad and firmer attach- ment, and are of an irregular shape, often ])rojecting in the form of a large spicula, and at other times assu- ming a somewhat stalactical appearance. Such fre- quently prove the source of much inconvenience, by

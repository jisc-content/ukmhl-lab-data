If an apparently simple tumour increase, and exhibit symptoms of inflamma- tion, it will perhaps be advantageous to apply leeches, to arrest that incited action which affords the acces- sion of new materials; this, however, cannot check the morbid activity inherent in the new formation, it only delays its augmenting. If a tumour is to be removed by external applications, it is evident that these must be such as shall prevent the deposit of new matter, and allow the absorbents to remove that which already exists ; for absorption is always going on in a tumour, though it leaves no evidence of its progress, on account of the deposition of new matter exceeding the removal of the old. Now, remedies capable of performing the above indication, are ex- tremely rai-e, and I must say that I am acquainted with none of them. The removal of a swelled gland, which has become enlarged from unorganized matter infiltrated into its texture, may occasionally be acce- lerated by such means ; but to trifle so with a new

AND DISEASES THENCE AHISTNG. 131 rate into sinuses, which communicate with the dis- eased bone, and are consequently long and tortuous, so that examination by the probe is rendered difficult. When necrosis is extensive, there is a risk of fracture occurring, if motion of the limb be permitted before a sufficient quantity of new matter has been effused; before nature has had sufficient time for the consoli- dation of her substitute, and consequently before the new bone has come to resemble the old in thickness and cohesion. Violent inflammatory fever attends the incited action of the vessels of the bone and Periosteum, which precedes necrosis. But after the abscesses have given way, the painful symptoms subside, and the health seldom suffers to any great extent, the system becoming gradually accustomed, as it were, to the new condition of the parts. Hectic supervenes only when the disease is very extensive. Frequently fresh collections of matter form as each piece of bone approaches the surface. When the effusion of new bone has extended to the neighbourhood of a joint, its motion may be very much impeded, and from the limb being kept in a state of rest for the cure of the necrosis, anchylosis may occur. » Treatment.—The means of preventing death of bone, or severe inflammatory action, have been already alluded to—abstraction of blood, rest, purgatives, antimonials, &c. When necrosis has occurred, no interference with the bone is allowable, unless the sequestrum is loose, or unless the patient's health

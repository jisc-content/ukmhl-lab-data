AND DISEASES THENCE AllISING. 121 neous fluid will cause absorption of the bone, the absorbed surface will, in its turn, secrete pus, and thus an ulcer will be produced; and, from the vascular action becoming debilitated in consequence of the previous incitation, that ulcer will in all probability- degenerate into caries. Much mischief is produced by- squeezing and bandaging tightly the inflamed parts, as can readily be understood; yet such practice is fre- quently adopted after suppuration. By it the inflam- matory action is excited anew, the formation of matter is very much increased, and however useful such ma- nipulation may be in stiffness of a joint, or mere swell- ing of bursae, sheaths, &c., still, in inflammation and abscess of bones or joints, it is extremely prejudicial, and from its indiscriminate employment by those ignorant of the profession, many limbs have been de- stroyed. General chronic periostitis, which is produced by exposure to cold, or occurs after or during mer- curial courses, and then is supposed to be a symptom of syphilis, is often relieved by the internal exhibition of the muriate of mercury, or other mercurial prepa- rations, combined with sarsaparilla and diaphoretics. In many instances, such an affection will yield to no other treatment; and thus the practitioner is occasion- ally obliged to have recourse to a somewhat para- doxical practice, giving mercury for a disease which seems to have been produced by that mineral. In inflammation of the short, or heads of the long, bones, if the action do not yield to topical bleeding, counter- irritants must be employed; and of these, perhaps, the moxa is the most effectual.

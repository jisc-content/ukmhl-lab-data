OF INFLAMMATION OF BONE, 112 a syphilitic taint, but the inflammatory disposition is much more frequently jiroduced in a system vitiated by the abuse of mercury. From the unyielding nature of the tissue, the pain attendant on inflammatory action is dreadfully excruciating ; it is also most violent during the night, even in chronic cases, a circumstance which does not admit of satisfactory explanation. The integuments over the inflamed bone are swollen, and the tumour is oedematous ; whilst a hard and solid tumefaction exists in the more deeply-seated parts, caused partly by enlarge- ment of the osseous tissue, and partly by effusion of lymph into the cellular substance. The bone is imbedded in a gelatinous or lymphatic effusion, situated beneath or external to the periosteum ; this membrane is more vascular than in its natural con- dition, thickened, and at the same time opened out in texture. The blood-vessels of the affected bone are much increased, both in activity and in size ; and, as a consequence of enlargement of the vessels, and thickening of the naturally delicate membrane on which the vessels ramify, the bone is increased in size, its texture is loose, sometimes resembling the cancellated structure, and its surface is occupied by numerous foramina, which are enlarged in j^roportion to the size of the vessels which they contaiii. The limb is often enormously swollen and indurated. The gelatinous eff'usion beneath the periosteum speedily becomes organized, nodules of osseous matter project into it, and adhere to the surface of the bone, gene- rally by a narrow neck ; these increase in n\unber.

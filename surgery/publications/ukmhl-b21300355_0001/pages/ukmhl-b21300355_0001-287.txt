OF ULCERS. 267 secreted, it readily escapes by the sides of the crust, without disturbing either it or its covering. Sores on the lower limbs are more difficult to manage. They are tedious, on account of their situation; the parts are at a distance from the centre of circulation, their action is weak, the return of blood is tardy, and the same facility is not afforded of restraining the motions of the part as in the upper extremities. In persons of a good constitution, however, the simple purulent sore often heals speedily even in the lower limbs. During the cure, the patient must be a good deal confined to the recumbent posture, and when erect, a bandage or laced stocking must be applied to the limb ; thus the return of blood is assisted, swells ing is prevented, and the affected parts placed in a state of comparative rest. Much pressure ought to be avoided, as it is apt to produce bad effects upon the sore, causing absorption of the granula- tions, thin bloody discharge, and great tenderness of the surface. After cicatrisation, the scars may be absorbed and sores reproduced, by external injuries, or an unhealthy state of the body; and so much does the state of a sore depend upon that of the general health, that the one is a good index of the other. II. In the second class of sores, or those with weak action, the granulations are high, flabby, of a pale colour, and possessed of little sensibility or vascula- rity ; the discharge is gleety, and the surface is liable to be destroyed by ulceration, or sloughing, upon the slightest excitement of the circulation in the part.

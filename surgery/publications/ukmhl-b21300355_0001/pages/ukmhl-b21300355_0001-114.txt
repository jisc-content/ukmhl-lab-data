94 OF INFLAMMATION OF change of its appearance, and when the swelling has occurred after these symptoms have been of some duration, then it is probable that the cartilages are the primary seat. For the most part, however, the symptoms are the same in all cases of chronic affec- tions of the joints, and all the articulating apparatus are sooner or later involved. When cartilage has been extensively absorbed, a grating sensation is felt on moving the articulating surfaces of the bones upon each other. Purulent matter not unfrequently collects in the substance of the bones, which in all cases ultimately become softened in a remarkable manner. In many subjects, without actual disease of the osseous tissue, the heads of the bones are so altered in consistence as to be easily cut with a knife. It has been a matter of dispute, whether, in this affection, the articulating extremities of the bones are enlarged or not; and the supposition that they are always more or less increased in size, has arisen from the extensive effusion and indurated state of the parts being mistaken for this enlargement. In the first stages of the disease, they are seldom, if, ever, enlarged; but when ulceration of the bone has occurred, new osseous matter is deposited to a greater or less degree in the neighbourhood of the ulcer,â€”an attempt by nature towards a ciu-e, but too often an ineffectual one. The bones, in strumous subjects, are often much enlarged, from collection of purulent matter in their substance giving rise to a sort of spina ventosa. In cases when the whole of

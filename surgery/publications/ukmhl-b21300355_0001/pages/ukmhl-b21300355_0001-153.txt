AND DISEASES THENCE ARISING. 133 columns, this must be divided by a trephine, a small saw, or cutting pliers, before the sequestrum can be extracted. When a dead portion of bone, of consi* derable length, is exposed at its centre, whilst its extremities are entangled by the old or substitute bone, the division of the exposed part, by means of the cutting pliers, will often be sufficient for the removal of the sequestrum, the cut ends being seized by the forceps, and one half removed after the other; and thus the perforation of the substitute will be rendered unnecessary. The instruments, and espe- cially those for extraction, ought to be very powerful, for in the employment of inefficient means there is much folly and cruelty. Incisions into a necrosed limb are attended with profuse haemorrhage from the incited vessels ; and in some cases it is with difficulty arrested, in consequence of retraction of the cut ends of the vessels not taking place within the indurated and almost cartilaginous parts. When necrosis has been extensive, the limb must be carefully supported by the application of splints and bandage, till the process of repai'ation be completed, in order to pre- vent fractui'e of the recently formed substitute. The treatment of necrosis may be summed up in a very few words. Prevent the necrosis, if possible —open abscesses whenever they appear ; encourage the patient to move the neighbouring joints; sup- port the strength; remove sequestra when loose— but do not interfere till they have been ascertained to be so; give the limb proper support and rest, when a large sequestrum is formed.

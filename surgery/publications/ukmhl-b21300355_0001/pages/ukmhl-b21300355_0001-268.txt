OF WOUNDS. 248 matter has formed. Sometimes tlie wound heals throughout its whole tract by adhesion, without any- bad symptoms being so much as threatened. Setons, recommended in this class of woimds, are of no ser- vice. It is not the narrowness of the external opening, as is supposed, that is the cause of all the mischief, but the bruising of deep-seated parts, and subsequent effusion into them. When a wound is to heal by granulation, the ex- posed surface at first is dry, painful, and slightly swelled, and afterwards a thin discharge of bloody serum is poured out, with relief to the painful sen- sations ; the surface is at this time covered by a thin layer of coagulated lymph, and the parts, if approxi- mated, are in the most favourable state for adhesion. Soon, however, the vessels assume a different mode of action, and secrete a fluid which, after exjDosui'e to the air, becomes purulent; the effused lymph has been organized, forms a living part of the surface from which it was deposited, and is covered and protected, in its yet delicate condition, by the purulent fluid. This new matter is disposed in numerous small conical projections of a florid colour ; and these, by their own power, form others similar to themselves, at the same time discharging purulent matter; so that, in a healthy constitution, the cavity is soon filled by the granulations, which come to the same level as the surrounding integument. Sometimes they are exu- berant, soft, and spongy, and in this state possessed of little sensibility, and but ill supplied with blood- vessels. At others, they are slow in approaching the

OF TUMOURS. 191 ened. The integuments in the neighbourhood of the tumours, and in the course of these absorbents, are of a blue colour, and the veins enlarged and tortuous; the limb below the enlargement swells, and is oedema- tous. The absorbents often become affected months and years after the removal of the original and exciting tumour; the immediate cause being taken away, but the inherent disposition to malignant action being left, not to be eradicated. In fact, the disease generally returns, either in the original integuments, in the cica- trix, or in the glands ; very frequently all are affected. Such enlargements of the glands have been said to arise, in the first instance, from irritation, and not from any participation in malignant action; and on this supposition, though extremely incorrect, cruel, bloody, unnecessary, and futile operations have been performed. Cancer seizes either the mucous or the cutaneous surface, with hardness and a warty excrescence ; this ulcerates, and is surrounded by a hardened base. The process of destruction advances, and the ulcerated part presents the same appearances as those of a sore arising from a similar action in a deeply-seated car- cinomatous tumour. The glands also enlarge, and assume the same aspect as if they had been the orignal seat of the disease. 1

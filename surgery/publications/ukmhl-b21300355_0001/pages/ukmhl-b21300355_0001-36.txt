16 ON INFLAMMATION. the ancients had no other means of suppressing bleed- ing from even the larger vessels, than astringents, sti- mulants, and cold. We often see a small artery pour- ing out its contents at the commencement of a sur- gical operation, and yet when we come to search for it, no haemorrhage can be perceived from that quar- ter. It must be admitted, that this termination of the bleeding is, in a great measui-e, owing to the contraction of the mouth of the vessel. But it fre- quently happens, that after the patient has been put to bed, the vessel again discharges its contents ; and here we have a distinct proof of the relaxation of the coats of a contracted artery. Because the muscular coat of arteries is not of a florid colour, and not immediately obedient to certain stimuli, and because fibrin has not yet been disco- vered by chemical analysis, many have denied their muscular contractility, although many facts distinct- ly prove that they do possess this power. The dis- pute, however, seems to be more about JV^vds than Facts. Although fibrin has not yet been discovered in ther middle coats of arteries, still it is to be remembered that animal chemistry is confessedly in its infancy,!, and that hence no conclusion can be drawn from thisi ., circumstance in support either of the one doctrine or of the other. The muscularity of the middle coat has also been- ' denied, because it does not seem continuous with the substance of the ventricle of the heart. This is un- worthy of serious refutation. 8

OF MOLLITIES OSSIUM, RACHITIS, &C. 137 Softening of the hones is met with at all ages, and in different degrees. It often follows dentition, measles, hooping-cough, or other infantile diseases inducing general debility. In females, it seems to be produced by the debilitating effects of leucorrhoea, miscarriages, floodings, &c. Loss of blood, in any way, predisposes to it. Mercury, given in immoderate quantities, produces a softening of the bones; and, in some most remarkable instances on record, the free use of common salt was the only cause assigned. When the disease affects children, all the bones generally suffer, those of the extremities as well as those of the trunk; the limbs become bent in an extraordinary manner, and the heads of the bones are swollen, and appear to be much more so in consequence of the wasted and flabby state of the muscles. The child walks with difficulty, and in many cases the legs are utterly incapable of supporting the weight of the body, so that he cannot remain in the erect position. The chest and pelvis become deformed, breathing is oppressed, the digestive organs are deranged, and the belly is tumid.

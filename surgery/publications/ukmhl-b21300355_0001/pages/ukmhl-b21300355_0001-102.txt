In a male aged forty- eight, a carbuncle of the size of a very large orange was situated in the centre of the forehead; by active local and constitutional treatment, he soon got well. All early and free incision must be made into the tumour; if the swelling is large or extensive, the preferable form of incision is the crucial; the ill- formed matter is thus evacuated, and the slough exposed, and more readily allowed to escape. If the mortification of the cellular tissue be extensive, and the sloughs prove firmly adherent, the free employ- ment of the caustic potass will be found of much service, the half-dead cellular substance being thereby completely destroyed, and the surrounding parts stimulated to a new and superior degree of action, necessary for the removal of the mortified parts, and reparation of the breach of surface. Poultices and fomentations are afterwards to be employed. The stomach and bowels must be put into proper order by the exhibition of suitable medicines; and the i-is vitco may be still farther supported by the adminis- tration of stimulants. If, after the separation of the sloughs, the exposed surface shall assume an indolent or debilitated action, stimulating dressings are to be employed. Such practice will be found sufficient to procure a speedy and favourable termination of the disease, in this country, where we have not to combat any of

OF ULCERS. 270 is brought tightly over the dressings, and continued for some way upward. By this application the mar- gins of the sore are brought nearer to each other, and the ulcerated surface is diminished ; the sluggish granulations and the subjacent parts are stimulated, and, becoming possessed of vigorous action, proceed in the process of reparation speedily and effectually; the surrounding parts, previously turgid and cedema- tous, are by the pressure brought to the same level with the newly-secreted matter, and new skin is quickly formed; but in the previous state, the old skin was much elevated, and possessed of such action as to cause a continuance of that elevation ; now, by the compression, the whole limb is properly sup- ported, serous effusion prevented, and oedema remo- ved ; the livid swelling of the lower part of the limb, which might ai'ise from the tightness of the adhesive plaster, is obviated by the bandage being first ap- plied. A feeling of uneasiness in the limb generally follows such dressing, but is of short duration ; should it increase, so as to amount to pain, the pouring of cold water occasionally over the dressings will soon restore the parts to comfort. Or the adhesive plaster may be slit up behind, immediately after its applica- tion ; indentation of the limb being thereby avoided, and sufficient pressure at the same time kept up on the sore. If possible, the dressings ought not to be removed before the second day, as much irritation will be produced by their frequent renewal. The benefits arising from this mode of treatment are truly surprising; the slow and indolent ulcer is speedily

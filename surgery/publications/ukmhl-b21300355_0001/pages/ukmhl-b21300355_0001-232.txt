OF TUMOUKS. 212 the bone are pressed outwards. Occasionally in- flammatory action is excited on the external sur- face, from the pressure of the contained fluid, and minute nodules of bony matter are effused, as if nature endeavoured to strengthen those walls which are daily becoming thinner, and more incapable of supporting the weight of those parts which they encircle. The disease differs from Osteosarcoma in the contents being uniformly fluid, generally puru- lent, though often mixed with more liquid and dark- coloured matter, or with a curdy substanceâ€”in the gradual extension of the bone, in no fungus protru- ding after a portion of the attenuated bone has given way, but matter being discharged as from a common abscess ; and in the tumour not being of a malignant disposition. At first there is considerable pain in the part whilst the matter is forming, but afterwards it becomes much less acute, and in many instances there is no inconvenience, except from the bulk of the tumour. Often after having reached no veiy large size, it becomes stationary, neither recedes nor en- larges, and all painful sensations cease ; in other cases it enlarges gradually, attains an enormous size, and produces much disturbance of the constitution ; but in such instances the patient is generally weak and cachectic. The largest tumour of this species which I have seen, occurred in the lower part of the femur. In breadth, seven inches, in length, seven and one- fourth. The parietes were composed of an extremely thin lamina of bone, and in this there were numerous \leficiencies supplied by delicate ligamentous matter ; 5

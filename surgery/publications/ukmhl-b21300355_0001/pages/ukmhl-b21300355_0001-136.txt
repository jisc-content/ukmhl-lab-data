116 OF INFLAMMATION OF BONE, tends, and there is little or no effort towards repara- tion. It may therefore tend to prevent confusion of the two different morbid states, if we confine the term ulceration to suppuration and absorption of bone, whilst the vessels retain a considerable power of action, throw out new matter, and procure a reparation of the breach ; and this condition of the osseous tissue exists when the disease is situated in the surface of the bone, and when it has been produced by an external cause. On the contrary, the term Caries will describe that peculiar Mnd of ulceration in which reparation is hardly attempted by nature, and is with difficulty obtained by the most active interference ; and this dis- ease will most generally be found to affect the cancel- lated structure. The comparative frequency of one or other of the terminations of inflammation depends much on the kind of bone implicated. Caries almost uniformly occurs in the heads of long and in the cancellated structure of the short bones, in the same way that unhealthy suppuration most fre- quently takes place in the loose cellular substance of the soft parts. When matter has formed in the sub- stance of a bone, the outer lamella becomes absorbed, and the effusion undermines the periosteum, which, from the distension, also ulcerates, and the matter spreads into the neighbouring cellular tissue, or makes its way to the surface, and is evacuated. The dis- charge is often continued in consequence of a dead portion of the cancellated structure being imbedded either in the carious cavity, or in the soft parts. It was formerly remarked that bones become highly

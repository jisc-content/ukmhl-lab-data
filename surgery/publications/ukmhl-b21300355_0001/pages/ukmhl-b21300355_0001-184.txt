OF INFLAMMATION OF VEINS. which case, a long needle, or needles, armed with 4 double ligature, can be passed beneath its base, and the ligature can then be separated, and so applied as to cause sufficient constriction of its whole base. The disease, however, occasionally occupies such situ- ations as are totally beyond the reach of mechanical means. The application of potass has been recom- mended, and is certainly sufficiently powerful to de- stroy, and occasion the removal of, the diseased parts ; but its use is attended with great danger of profuse haemorrhage. Of Inflammation of Veins. Veins are very susceptible of inflammation, and in them the action is apt to extend rapidly; in some cases it reaches the right side of the heart, producing most violent symptoms, and speedy dissolution. Inflammation in the venous, as in the other tissues; may terminate in resolution. Otherwise, lymph is secreted, whereby the coats of the vessel becoihe thick- ened, and its internal surface is agglutinated, causing obliteration of the canal to a greater or less extent. Suppuration also occurs, and the pus may be depo- sited in a cyst formed amongst the coats of the vessel; or, as is most frequently the case, it is secreted from the internal coat, and effused into the cavity of the vein. It then generally accumulates, its passage into the circulation being prevented by a deposition of lymph sufficient to occupy tlie calibre of the vessd

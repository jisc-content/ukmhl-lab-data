ON SUPPURATION. 40 Glandular swellings of all kinds, and in all si- tuations, often followed by suppuration, are apt to occur from irritations of various descriptions, but more so in constitutions originally weak, or which have become debilitated by disease or any other cause. The larger glandular tumours are formed by congregation and agglutination of the smaller ones, and by the deposition of adventitious matter in the cellular substance; spontaneous separation of the smaller tumours composing these is a highly favour- able symptom, and equally encouraging to the sur- geon and the patient. Dentition, carious teeth, stumps of teeth, excoria- tions behind the ears, eruptions on the scalp, aflfec- tions of the lining membranes of the eyelids, mouth, nose, of the skin of the face, are daily found giving rise to glandular swellings in the neck; whilst irri- tations in the urethra, excoriation or slight disease about the anus, corns or sores about the feet or toes, &c., produce similar affections of the glands in the groin. Such sources of irritation are, of course, to be looked for in the first instance, and will often materially influence the diagnosis, though too much is occasionally attributed to their influence. Such glandular tumours, however, sometimes occur spon- taneously, or at least without any evident cause. They have been mistaken for other diseases, accord- ing to their situationâ€”for aneurism, hernia, or vene- real bubo, &c.; the latter mistake is often uninten- tionally committed by the ignorant, or designedly by the unprincipled.

AFFECTIONS OF THE ARTERIAL SYSTEM. 159 and disappears; being Iconnected with the vessel by means of a dense impervious chord, to which condi- tion that portion of the artery has been reduced. The anastomosing vessels enlarge more and more, carry blood freely from above to below the ligature, and thence to below the tumour; some passing to the lat- ter situation directly from above the ligature. Along with the muscular and other branches, the neurilemal vessels also become enlarged, and compress the ner- vous filaments; and to this are to be attributed the annoying pains which occur in a limb after the ope- ration for aneurism. The enlargement of the neu- rilemal arteries can be distinctly shown by dissection. Immediately after the operation, the circulation in the limb cannot be so vigorous as before; its temperature is consequently diminished, and it pos- sesses less power of resisting the influence of stimuli. The limb ought to be kept moderately warm, for if too much heat be applied, there is risk of gangrene. Afterwards the temperature rises, and soon becomes above the natural standard, the blood, from obstruct tion in the internal parts, being chiefly determined to the surface. After the collateral circulation has been completely established, the limb regains its tem- perature. Secondary haemorrhage is occasionally a conse- quence of this operation ; nor is it to be wondered at, after even one ligature badly applied, and far less after two or more, however dexterously. If, however, the operation by single ligature be properly performed.

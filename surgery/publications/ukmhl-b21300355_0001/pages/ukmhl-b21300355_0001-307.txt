287 AND THEIR CONSEQUENCES. with a mild or malignant virus, or totally devoid of any poisonous quality. From the simple ulcer there arises a constitutional affection, in all respects resembling that which follows gonorrhoea, (a disease which will be treated of under affections of particular mucous surfaces;) but before attending to this, it will be proper to advert to another form of ulcer, which differs but slightly from the pre- ceding in primary and secondary symptoms. It is a sore with a brown surface, either on a level with, or above, the surrounding parts, with defined and elevated edges, with no cartilaginous hardness of base or mar- gins, and with no tendency to spread either by slough- ing or by ulceration. Such may occur in the same situation as the simple sores, but they often form on the outer surface of the prepuce, or on the scrotum ; and are not unfrequently met with round the orifice of the prepuce, which is a most troublesome situation, as, in healing, they generally produce phymosis. The bubo which follows this, differs from that caused by the simple sore, in having, after ulceration of the integument, a greater disposition to burrow; and this tendency is more marked where mercury has been employed. From either of these forms of ulcer, it sometimes happens that constitutional affections arise, either during the existence of the sore, or some weeks after it has cicatrized. The usual secondary symptoms are those attend- ant on a papular eruption. There is fever, with pains referred to the head, to the joints, chiefly the larger ones, and to the chest, which latter symptom

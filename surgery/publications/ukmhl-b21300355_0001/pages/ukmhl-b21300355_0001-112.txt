92 OF INFLAMMATION OF the patient is disinclined to use it, and it is soon tired by the slightest exertion. The swelling becomes more solid, though still remaining elastic, and the feeling of fluctuation diminishes. Effusion of lymph follows that of serum, the latter having been absorbed ; the motion of the joint is still further impeded, and the articulation is distorted ; the patient keeps the limb in the most easy position, generally that of par- tial flexion, in which it becomes almost immovably fixed. The muscles, from disuse, shrink, the adipose substance is absorbed, the shafts of the bones also are diminished in size, and thus the whole limb is rendered slender and wasted, so as to make the swell- ing of the diseased articulation still more conspicuous. The bones are softened, and the muscles are of a white colour, as in the limbs of the paralytic or bed- ridden, and resemble more the cellular than the mus- cular tissue. The wasting of the muscles and loss of power, often precede the appearance of disease; this is frequently observed in the shoulder-joint, the deltoid shrinking, and almost disappearing, before any disease in the articulation is suspected. Not un- frequently, also, this wasting occurs without obvious cause, or any affection of the joint. When the disease is advancing, the patient may feel no acute pain, but merely a reluctance to use the limb, and from this, if long continued, the muscles, and afterwards the bones, become wasted. Wasting of the limbs in children, often of one of the lower, frequently arises from disorder of the bowels, and the irritation and debility attendant on teething.

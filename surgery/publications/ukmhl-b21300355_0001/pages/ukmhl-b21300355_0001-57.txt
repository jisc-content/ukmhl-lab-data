ON SUPPURATION. 37 considerable danger, being generally followed by the most violent constitutional disturbance. Certain cases would seem to warrant the belief, that a species of metastasis occurs ; that the matter is absorbed, and again secreted in a part, perhaps, of the utmost im- portance in the animal economy. In pui'ulent col- lections, after wounds from accident or operation, on the suspension of the discharge the patient becomes affected with severe constitutional irritation, and gra- dually sinks ; and, on dissection, purulent depots of considerable size are frequently found in the viscera of the chest or abdomen, which were not indicated by any, unless very equivocal, symptoms, and these appearing very soon before dissolution. A late writer has endeavoured to connect this with inflammation of the veins ; but such an opinion is not borne out by observation, although the two circumstances may occasionally co-exist. From the discharge varying according to the state of the system, the latter can in general be accurately ascertained by examination of the sores which afflict the patient. In collections of matter not far removed from the surface, the most superficial, and generally the most dependent, portion of the parietes appears inflamed; â€¢its inner surface is gradually absorbed ; and when it has thus become attenuated, a portion of the inte- giiment sloughs or ulcerates. A communication is thus established with the diseased parts, through the external surface, providing an aperture for the eva- cuation of the matter, of extraneous substances, or

237 ligature ought to inclose nothing but the vessel. Nei- ther ought the ligatures to be placed at any consider- able distance, but as close to the wounded point as possible; otherwise, circulation in the included part may be restored. The ligature, round, narrow, firm, ought to be tightly applied. Cases of haemorrhage have occurred, in which the tying of the vessel im- mediately above the wound has been successful; but these are few, and by no means afford any argument for the adoption of such a measure. If the vessel is merely punctured, it is necessary to apply the ligature by means of a needle, and the parts are to be dis- turbed as little as possible. If, however, the artery is completely divided, its cut extremities are to be drawn out of their sheath, and the ligatures applied close to the connexions of the vessel; the vasa vaso- rum, in the immediate vicinity of the deligated point, being left to carry on those processes by which obli- teration is accomplished. The instrument which will generally be found most useful for laying hold of the vessel, is the common dissecting forceps, but a hook will, in certain circumstances, be more convenient. Haemorrhage from the small vessels soon ceases ; and before re-action occurs, their orifices have generally become so obstructed as to resist the effusion of blood. The effects of ligature on a vein are somewhat different from those on an artery. The inner coat of , the former is more dense and elastic, and remains entire, whilst the external and middle are divided. It is puckered by the ligature, and its opposite sur-

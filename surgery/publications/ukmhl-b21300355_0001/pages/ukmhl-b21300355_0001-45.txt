Any solid substance, though by no means acri- monious in its quality, may act as an exciting cause, as by pressure or friction. Wounds also, especially when of considerable size, and occurring whilst the constitution is in an un- healthy condition, give rise to local, and occasion- ally genera], inflammatory action. This action is besides frequently produced by in- jury from an obtuse body causing a bruise or frac- ture ; by the lodgement in a part of extraneous sub- stances, or of decayed portions of the system,â€”such as portions of bones, tendons, &c.; or by irritating matter generated in the system itself, by concretions, tumours, vitiated secretions, &c.

In some instances, it appears to act directly oh a part, as in inflammation of the mucous membrane lining the organs of respiration : in others; its action ; probably by disturb- ing the'equaility of the eitculation, the inflammation occurs in a part distant from the surface the tem- perature of which had been diminished ; and in the great majority of instances''in'which inflammation has occurred, in consequence! of v^ry intense cold, it is produced by the sudden applicatioii of heat whilst the temperature of the part is greatly below 1

21 ON INFLAMMATION. vessel, as has been proved by numerous experiments made on the webs of the feet of frogs. We may also conclude that the blood of an inflamed part un- dergoes chemical changes ; for when the part becomes gangrenous, the blood then loses its red colour, and assumes a yellowish-brown hue, which necessarily implies an alteration in its chemical constitution. It seems not unlikely, that the change which is early observed in the appearance of the blood of an inflamed part, is the commencement of a chemical process, which, if the vessels do not regain their contractile power, terminates in the total destruction of the ordi- nary properties of that fluid. It is probable that the more modern speculators in medical science have paid too little attention to the state of the fluids, and to the fact, that, when diseased action occurs in a part, its secretions and supplying flidd are very consider- ably changed. , But the blood in inflammation also undergoes a change, observable after its removal from the circu^ lation, and especially when the system sympathizes with the part affected. The blood does not coagulate so quickly as in the natural state, or else the red globules, being increased in specific gravity, fall ra- pidly to the lower part of the containing vessel, so that a yellowish crust appears on the surface of the crassamentum or clot; and this appearance is termed the inflammatory or buffy coat. In certain states of inflammation, this crust is also much contracted, so that its marginal circumference is at a considerable distance from the sides of the containing vessel; its

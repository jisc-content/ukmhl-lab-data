148 OF INFLAMMATION, AND OTHER by the action of the absorbents. Or, after obliteration of the aneurismal cavity, the fibrine may be deposited in so great quantity as to occupy the calibre of the vessel above and below the tumour, obstructing the progress of its blood, causing it to flow by the colla- teral smaller branches, and effecting a spontaneous cure, somewhat similar to that produced by the arti- ficial application of a ligature. Coagula are not formed in the dilated vessel, to whatever size it may be en- larged, unless there is a fissure of the internal coat, for in no other way can a portion of the blood become stagnant, while the calibre of the vessel remains per- vious. A spontaneous cure may also be accomplished from the original aneurism being compressed by one of a more recent origin, causing ultimate obliteration of the canal. Of this I recollect one remarkable instance; the patient was afflicted with an aneurism of the sub- clavian artery, which had attained a large size, and the cure for the disease in this situation being then unknown, the patient was considered as lost; but some time after the tumour began to diminish, and disappeared. The patient died ; and the cause of death was found to be the giving way^of an aneu- rismal tumour of the arteria anonyma^'^'which was situated so closely to the aneurism of the subclavian as to have acted as a mechanical compress, causing obliteration of the vessel at that point. \Vlien a cure has been effected, the vessel is found to be converted into a dense and impervious chord at the site of the tumour. The canal above is dilated,

But caustics are applied injudiciously to firm and healthy granu- lations which have not yet reached the level of the surrounding parts ; they are only useful in repressing exuberant granulations, or in destroying half-dead parts, which interrupt or deteriorate the cure. Along with the topical treatment of ulcers, internal means are, in most cases, indispensable. Thus, in indolent ulcers, the state of the constitution is often sluggish, and ought to be changed by the exhibition of alteratives or stimulants; and, with this view, much benefit is derived from a prudent and restrain- ed use of mercury, from the lytta vesicatoria, from minute and occasional doses of arsenic, from the free exhibition of sarsaparilla, and from generous diet, porter and wine.

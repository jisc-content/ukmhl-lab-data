171 OF TUMOUllS. upwards of 60 or 70 lbs. Tumours diflfer much in structure, and though their general appearance may not be dissimilar, one will scarcely be found exactly resembling another. In many cases, the external appearance proves no certain index of the nature of the tumour; sometimes, however, its feel and general external character leads the experienced surgeon to form a correct diagnosis of its internal structure. It is impossible, by any process of reasoning, to account for the different actions which these growths possess ; and even minute anatomical investigation, both mor- bid and healthy, does not throw much light upon the subject. Tumours are divided into Solid and Encysted. The solid are generally enveloped by a dense cellular sheath of the surrounding cellular substance, yielding and becoming condensed in proportion as the tumour increases in size ; this covering appears as a barrier between the healthy and diseased parts, shutting out the latter, as much as possible, from connexion with the rest of the body, and preventing the former from participating in the injurious tendencies of the latter. Some tumours have no such limit, but extend in the direction where there is the least resistance, hold a free intercourse with the surrounding parts, and impart to them their morbid disposition and action. Others are limited in their situation and communi- cations, but prove dangerous or annoying from their bulk. Some grow rapidly, and prove troublesome in a few weeks or months ; others remain without much increase for years, and afford little or no inconve-

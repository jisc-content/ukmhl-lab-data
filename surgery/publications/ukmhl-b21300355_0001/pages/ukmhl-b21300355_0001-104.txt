OF INFLAMMATION OF 84. which, in the healthy state of parts, lines the internal surface of the prepuce, becomes converted into a cuticular membrane. In neglected and long-continued excoriation of the nates, the raw surface, which was at first tender and irritable, and discharged a serous fluid, becomes villous, less sensible, and discharges a fluid similar to a mucous secretion. In sinuses also of long duration, the secreting surface becomes changed, so as to resemble a mucous membrane, and the discharge, from being purulent or gleety, becomes mucous, or at least resembles a mucous fluid. A mucous surface, when inflamed, at first furnishes a secretion, increased in quantity, and but little changed in appearance from the healthy fluid ; after- wards the discharge resembles purulent matter, and is termed muco-purulent. When, however, the inflam- mation is violent, the discharge becomes bloody, or is altogether suppressed, and the membrane is thick- ened. Inflammation of a mucous membrane is very apt to spread with great rapidity, in this respect resembling the corresponding aff^ection of the skin. It is attended with a sense of itching, and a burning pain. This pain is much increased by the parts being thrown into action, as in expelling their contents, chiefly if these be of an acrid quality. The membrane is thickened, and of a spongy appearance ; its surface is red, and sometimes covered with flakt^^ of lymph ; occasionally it is much softened, and coated with a viscid adherent mucus ; and it would appear, in many instances, that, in acute inflammation, the membrane is generally softened, whilst it becomes indurated from

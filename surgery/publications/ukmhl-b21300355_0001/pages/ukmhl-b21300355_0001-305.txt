285 AND THEIll CONSEQUENCES. and probably arise from the acrimony of the female secretions causing tenderness and ulceration of the parts. The application of gonorrhoeal matter readily produces the simple ulcer on the glans or prepuce, particularly if an abrasion or rawness existed ; and if the matter be allowed to remain on an unbroken surface, a pustule will form, and ulceration follow. From this latter cause numerous sores are produced, separated from each other by sound parts, and not extending into one continuous ulcer ; and this con- dition may have been preceded, on the glans, by a rawness of the surface and a profuse discharge, or by a herpetic eruption on the mucous lining of the prepuce. One man may be affected with gonorrhoea, and another Math ulcer, from connexion with the same female, the same day or hour ; and it is doubt- ful whether the eflfect is not similar, in both cases, viz. ulceration; for it is supposed, that in gonorrhoea the discharge, in some cases, proceeds from patchy ulceration of the mucous lining of the urethra, similar to the ulceration usually met with on the glans. In examining women who have communi- cated infection, very often no sores are found, and but little unhealthy discharge. In short, the simple elevated sore may arise from the application of secre- tions from an unbroken surface, from inoculation of matter from a similar sore, or spontaneously, from inattention to cleanliness. Sores with elevated sur- face, more extensive than those of the glans and prepuce, occur on the skin of the penis and scrotum, or in the folds of the thigh ; and in women they are

OF INFLAIMMATION OF 98 to the degree to which the cavity has been dilated. And in cases in which the matter has remained long within the cavity, the synovial membrane and the ligaments become blended into one soft mass, the internal surface of which is lined with a thick coat- ing of lymph, as in the case of common abscess. If purulent matter is effused externally, and communi- cate with the joint, the capsular ligament will be found to have ulcerated and given way at a certain point, forming an aperture, usually of small size, and with ragged margins. All these appearances may exist without disease of the cartilages or extremities of the bones ; but gene- rally they are also affected at the same time. At first the surface of the cartilage is slightly irregular and rough, and the change is not observed, unless on minute inspection. Afterwards the surface is marked with small depressions, which may be numerous, and are surrounded with irregular and somewhat serrated margins. They gradually increase in depth and ex- tent, and the subjacent bone is ultimately exposed at one or more points. Often the greater part of the cartilage is removed by absorption; the bone is thus exposed, opened out in its texture, softened, of an irregular surface, and in some places depressed, con- taining a thin ichorous fluid, while the process of ulceration has also extended to the osseous tissue. In other cases, portions of cartilage, ragged, of an un- usually white colour, and partly dead, are slightly adherent to the subjacent bone, or to the surround- ing portions of sound cartilage.

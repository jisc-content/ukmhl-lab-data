ON INFLAMMATION. 15 remarkable in arteries which have been obstructed by ligature, or which are beginning to be oblitera- ted; distinct, uniform rugae, disposed transversely, being observed on the internal surface, above the constricted point, and accurately corresponding to the transverse fibres of the artery. . The contractile, or muscular coat, becomes stronger and more distinct as the arteries extend farther from the centre of circulation. But even though muscular fibres could not be dis- tinguished, still we are not thence to conclude that they do not exist. Muscles differ much in appear- ance in different parts of the same animal, as is ex- emplified when we compare the fibres of the deltoid with those of the middle coat of the intestines ; and in certain animals that evidently move themselves by a muscular power, nothing resembling the usual fibrous structure can be perceived. It has been said, that arteries possess no contractile power ; but this opinion is overturned by many phe- nomena both in health and in disease. The arteries always accommodate themselves to the contained fluid, as practitioners daily discover by the state of the pulsations. They contract on the application of stimuli, as electricity and sharp-pointed instruments, and what suits equally our argument, though not to be so easily explained, they contract also on the ap- plication of cold ; for instance, cold cloths are fre- quently effectual in stopping secondary haemorrhage after operations, or haemorrhage from the mucous sur- faces. With the exception of the cautery and pressure.

5 ON INFLAMMATION. in cases of Paronychia or ^Vhitlow. There the digi- tal, the radial, and ulnar arteries, with their branch- es, beat more violently than usual; and with much greater force, though not more rapidly, than the ves- sels in other parts of the body. Swelling is caused by the enlarged and overloaded vessels relieving themselves by effusion of part of their contents into the cellular texture. The effu- sion varies in extent and consistence, according to the degree of inflammatory action, the nature of the mat- ter which escapes, and the species of resistance afford- ed. C(Etei'is paribus, the greater the resistance, the less is the effusion, and the more violent is the inflam- matory action, and the chance of its speedy and fa^ vourable termination is the more diminished. Even the enlargement of the blood-vessels produces a slight degree of intumescence previous to effusion. This effusion, or relief to the vessels, giving rise to swell- ing, when it occurs in loose cellular tissues, may be considered as a beneficent provision of nature. But in vital organs, it may be productive of the most se- rious consequences; as in these, very slight effusion will often endanger the structure of the organ, destroy its "functions, and not unfrequently be attended with fatal consequences. The nature of the effused fluid varies according to the degree of violence and advancement of the action, and is also modified by the texture in which that action occurs. It may consist of Serum, Lymph, or Blood, In inflammation, in short, exhalation appears to be much increased, whilst the powers of

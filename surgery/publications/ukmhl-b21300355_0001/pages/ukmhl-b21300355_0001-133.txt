AND DISEASES THENCE ARISING. 113 gradually assume a solid appearance, and thus the bone is thickened, often to a very great extent; and the texture of the bone becomes greatly condensed by absorption in some degree keeping pace with the secre- tion of osseous matter, both from the vessels which ramify throughout the substance of the bone, and from those which supply the more external parts. It has been supposed that the new osseous matter is deposited almost entirely from vessels of the peri- osteum, but it is only secreted by the vessels which ramify within the substance of the bone, and by the vessels of the periosteum after they have entered the osseous tissue. Thus, in the case of fracture, the new osseous granulations are uniformly found adherent either to the broken surfaces, the vessels of which are enlarged and increased in activity, or to fragments which have been detached and retain their vitality, but not to the under surface of the periosteum. There is no doubt that thin laminae of bone are occasion- ally found attached to the periosteum, or impacted within its substance; but this is to be attributed to that morbid action of the tissue, to which, along with several other membranes, it is subject. We not imfrequently find earthy matter adhere to the dura mater, to the pleura, and also to the peri- toneal covering of the uterus, yet no one will assert that these membranes are destined to form or repair bones ; and so it is with the periosteum. In the healthy state of the system, the blood-vessels of each part repair any breach of surface by a substance closely resembling the primary tissue; solution of H

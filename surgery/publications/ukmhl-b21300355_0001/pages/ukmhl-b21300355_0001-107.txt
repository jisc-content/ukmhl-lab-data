By this process the parts are intimately united to each other, and consolidated into one mass; or are merely approxi- mated and joined, at one or more points, by portions of lymph, in some cases thin and narrow, in others extensive and of considerable thickness ; the adhering bands either extend in a straight direction, from one surface to another, or interlace, forming a sort of net-work. After adhesions of various kinds have been formed, they are often lengthened and attenuated in consequence of the motion of the parts, as is parti- cularly the case with adhesions between the pleurae costalis and pulmonalis. When they have been of considerable duration, they often resemble the original membrane from which they were deposited, becoming thin and transparent, smooth on their external sur- face, and furnishing a serous secretion. Not unfre- quently, inflammatory action in this tissue terminates in suppuration ; pus being secreted by the membrane, accumulates in the cavity formed by its expansion. By collections of matter, whether serous, sero-puru- lent, or purulent, within a serous cavity, the functions of the contained viscera are deranged, much impeded, and in many instances morbid actions are excited in them ; the inflammation, whether it terminate in resolution, or proceed to serous effusion, adhesion, or purulent secretion, is also attended with constitutional disturbance, and the symptoms are proportioned to the original intensity of the action, and the extent and kind of its termination. The effusion of lymph.

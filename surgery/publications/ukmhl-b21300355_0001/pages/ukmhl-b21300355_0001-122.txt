The patient retains the limb in the most comfortable position, and it is generally bent upward towards the pelvis. In many cases matter forms behind, or rather below, the trochanter major, and the collection often attains a large size. When the presence of matter has been ascertained in this situation, it has been recommended that an early opening should be made, on the supposition, that the disease arises from an acrimonious discharge into and round the joint, and that, by the matter being allowed to escape, the cause of the disease is removed. Though the prin- ciple is incorrect, still the rule of practice is import- ant ; for in consequence of the long-continued presence of matter, accumulating in a cavity which is not dilated in proportion to the increase of purulent secre- tion, or even not confined by a limited cyst, the original affection will be much aggravated, and disease induced in the neighboiu'ing parts. On discharge of the matter, the painfid feelings usually subside. The fortnation of matter is preceded by great pain, and

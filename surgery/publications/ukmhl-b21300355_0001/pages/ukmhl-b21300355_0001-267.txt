During the after treatment, the sides of the sore ought to be well supported, so as to prevent, as much as possible, suppuration from ex- tending along the neighbouring cellular tissue ; but, at the same time, the dressing must not be so tight as to cause irritation. When abscesses have formed in the neighbourhood, the cavities must be freely- exposed by incision ; thus a free discharge will be given to the matter, and the cavity brought to gra- nulate from the bottom. During the suppurating stage, the patient's strength must be maintained by generous diet. Punctured wounds are dangerous, from the deep and internal effusion of blood and serum which usually attends them. The effusion, which in open wounds is poured out externally, and moderates and prevents the excited action from exceeding what is salutary, is, in punctured wounds, poured into the substance of the limb to its detriment. It is followed by severe inflam- matory action and profuse suppuration. In order to prevent these untoward results, it was formerly the practice immediately to dilate the wound ; but this is hurtful, for if the wound be deep, as it generally is, dilatation of its whole extent is a proceeding severe in itself, and in its consequences ; whilst, if the external part only of the wound is dilated, the operation will entirely fail to effect what is intended.

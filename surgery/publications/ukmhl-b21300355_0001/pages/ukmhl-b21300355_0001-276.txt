OF WOUNDS. 256 they entered ; but if situated superficially, and at a distance from the opening, this will be more readily accomplished through an incision made upon them ; if allowed to remain, suppuration will occur in the neighbourhood, the surrounding cellular tissue will be condensed, an abscess will be formed containing the foreign body, and by the process of absorption proceeding in the parts external to the abscess, the ball will at last reach the sui'face, and be discharged. The track is often so extremely tortuous, as to render it impossible to ascertain the situation, or even the existence of the foreign body, which greatly impedes the operation ; and, in other instances, it may be necessary to allow the ball to remain undisturbed, on account of its being placed near important parts, which might be injured by any attempt at removal. Foreign bodies often remain lodged in muscular parts for years, having become enveloped in a dense cyst, and having ceased to produce any great irritation. In consequence of the force with which they have been projected, and the resistance which has been opposed to their progress in the body, balls, when extracted, either immediately after the infliction of the injury, or after a considerable time has elapsed, are seldom found to retain their globular form, but are flattened and ragged, and not unfrequently completely divided by the bones on which they have impinged. A bullet may be divided into numerous fragments on a bone, and part may enter into the osseous substance, whilst other portions penetrate in all directions into the soft parts, and, though sharj) and irregular, may remain 1

Scarifications are some- times used; when these are made merely into the sphacelated part, they can be productive of good only by allowing the escape of matter ; when they extend deeply, they are injurious. This practice, however, as will be noticed, is adopted with the best effects when mortification is threatened. When the sloughs become loose, they must be removed; and when the sphacelated part has sepa- rated entirely, the healing of the breach must be promoted by judicious dressing and bandaging. In mortification of an extremity, in consequence of injury, removal of the part by incision in the sound substance, was formerly as much dreaded as in chronic cases before the separation had commenced ; but such fears have now subsided, and the practice of delay has been in a great measure relinquished,â€” amputation being performed in the sound part, and during the progress of the disease.

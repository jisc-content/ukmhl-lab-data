In short, the circumstances necessary to entitle a morbid formation to the appellation of fungus hsematodes, are a fungous structure and appearance, and hemorrhage proceeding from it to a greater or less degree, and with more or less frequency. Fungi are frequently met with, but there are certainly few fungi haematodes. The excrescence is generally of a dark colour, re- sembling a mass of coagulated blood, but of more soft consistence, and its extremity is often of a sloughy appearance. It is evidently organized, for, on being injured even in a very slight degree, haemorrhage ensues from the part which has been broken or con- tused, and frequently the growth bleeds spontane- ously. At first the haemorrhage is in general slight, but is often repeated, is very profuse, and in most instances cannot be arrested. The vessels in the sub- stance of the morbid mass are diseased in their coats, and have altogether lost their power of contraction; they give way either spontaneously, or by laceration, and by their non-contraction, they appear to serve merely as passive tubes, through, which the blood is poured out by the active vessels which supply them ; the latter are not exposed to any of the causes which tend to produce speedy obstruction of their canals, therefore continue to transmit their contained fluid through their subservient branches, and from this the uncontrollable nature of the haemorrhage can he N.

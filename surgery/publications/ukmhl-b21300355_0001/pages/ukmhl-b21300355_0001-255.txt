235 OF WOUNDS. pressure. In oozing from small vessels, pressure may be applied hy means of agaric, sponge, lint, &c. But in wounds of the larger vessels, the most efficient mean is a graduated compress of lint placed imme- diately on the external wound, and supported by a firmly applied bandage. The bandage ought to en- circle not only the wounded part, but every part of the limb with a uniform tightness, not so great as to arrest the circulation; the parts are thereby sup- ported, and engorgement prevented. This method, when employed previously to the effusion of much blood into the cellular tissue, has proved effectual in wounds even of the brachial, femoral, and carotid arteries. When blood has been extensively injected into the limb, when the aperture in the vessel has re- mained pervious, and when a large diffused aneurism exists, bandaging is worse than useless. By its ap-^ plication in such a case the limb becomes discoloured,, and swells extensively; there is a risk of mortification from impeded circulation. If a small quantity only of blood has escaped, its diffusion and increase may be prevented by the bandage: but a cyst will never- theless be formed in the cellular tissue ; its parietes will communicate with the margins of the aperture in the artery, its cavity with the canal of the vessel; an aneurism of the false kind will be established, and will run the course of one arising spontaneously. A ligature, well applied, is the only means that can be relied on. The immediate effect of a tightly drawn ligature is to avert the flow of blood, to divide the internal and middle coats at the deligated point,

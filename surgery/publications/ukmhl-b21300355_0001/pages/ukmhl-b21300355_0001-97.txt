OF ERYSIPELAS. 77 When the erysipelas has gone off, the incisions are treated as common wounds, by dressing and bandage. After punctures, or incisions, more or less blood is allowed to flow, according to circumstances. In erysi- pelas of the face, punctures are preferable to incisions, as by the employment of the former the countenance is no way disfigured; if, however, in erysipelas of the scalp, the integuments become swollen, and present a puffy feeling, whilst at the same time cerebral symp- toms supervene, free incision or incisions, through the whole thickness of the integuments, must be made. If erysipelas be thus actively treated, I think I may safely affirm that it will not often, unless accompanied with symptoms of putrid fever, terminate fatally ; if these means are employed early, the constitutional disturbance will be modified or prevented, and no derangement of the cerebral functions will ensue. Powders, such as flour, chalk, camphor, have been applied to the erysipelatous surface, but are of little use, and, by their irritation, frequently prove injuri- ous on the bursting of the vesicles. They are applied, according to some, with the view of cooling the surface, and after all the part is nveloped in folds of flannel. Cold applications, such as the spirituous and evapo- rating lotions, vinegar and spir. aq. acet. ammonise, may, in many cases, afford temporary relief, but their use is fraught with the utmost danger; for their direct action is to produce Metastasis, and if that be to an internal organ of importance, the result is too gene- rally fatal. And if the erysipelas, on leaving the part originally affected, attack another also superficial, the

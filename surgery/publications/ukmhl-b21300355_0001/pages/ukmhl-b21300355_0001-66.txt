46 ON SUPPURATION. itself externally, whilst it is making extensive pro- gress internally; and if a free opening is not made, fistula ani is the result. The propriety of early evacuation of purulent mat- ter in important, or very sensible, organs, such as the eye and testicle, is self-evident. The larger arterial and venous trunks appear not to suffer from the suppui'ation, for in purulent depots we find them entire, and much thickened by copious effusion of lymph into their outer cellular coat; the nerves, however, are not so much protected by nature, but suffer along with the other tissues. The most convenient and effectual mode of open- ing an abscess is with a sharp-pointed bistoury, and the incision will vary in extent according to the cir- cumstances of the case. The straight instrument will be found to answer best in deep-seated collections; in the more superficial it may be slightly curved. The iaperture must always be made at the most dependent part, which is also, generally, the thinnest, as there- by a free exit is allowed to the matter. If the inci- sion be not made in a dependent part, a considerable quantity of the matter will be retained within the abscess, and can only be evacuated by squeezing the parts, applying comi)resses, &c., which produce much irritation and unnecessary inconvenience to the pa- tient. When the abscess has been deeply seated, and tlie incision made through a considerable thickness of healthy parts, it is necessary to introduce a small piece of lint between the edges of the wound, other-

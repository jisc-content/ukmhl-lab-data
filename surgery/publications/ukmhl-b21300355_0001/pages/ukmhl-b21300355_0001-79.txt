ON MORTIFICATION. 59 that it is frequently designated the Inflammatio De- bilis. Of inflammatory affections, the erysipelatous most frequently terminates in gangrene ; in other words, the power of resisting incited action is not so great in the skin as in other parts of the body. The period at which the symptoms of gangrene appear after an accident, varies, in general, according to the severity of the injury. As was already observed, the part may be immediately deprived of its vitality -—if not, symptoms of gangrene sometimes appear within a few hours after reaction has taken place; while in other cases, tension, pain, and heat occur, and may continue for a longer or shorter time, accord- ing to the degree of power remaining in the part. Tension often exists to a great extent after severe injuries, from extravasation of blood or serum; the functions of the vessels are thereby interrupted, and gangrene is inevitable. As the action proceeds, the pain and heat often subside—the parts become flaccid -—dark-coloured serum is eff"used beneath the cuticle, forming what are termed Phlyctenae—the skin be- comes dull and livid—dark streaks extend along the limbs—air is efi'used into the subcutaneous cellular tissue, causing a sense of crepitation when pressed by the finger—sloughs form, either black or of an ash colour—and the gangrene involves a greater or less extent of the limb. In some instances, the mortification is most towards the surface; in others, it is chiefly amongst the deeply seated parts. Sudden cessation of pain is generally regarded as an unequi- vocal sign of the occurrence of gangrene, especially

AND THEIR CONSEQUENCES. 289 lymphatic glands, at the angle of the jaw, are not unfrequently swollen and painful. Such is the usually mild character of this affec- tion ; but if its progress has been interrupted by any means, more particularly by mercury, it assumes a more complicated form, and a less tractable nature. If that mineral is administered in the usual style, and at the commencement, when the fever and other symp- toms are high, the patient's sufferings are all much aggravated. After the fever has subsided, the erup- tion will often be found to disappear under the use of, mercury ; but it is extremely apt to recur, as soon as. the system has shaken itself free from the effects of that medicine. The mercury produces an irritation, which supersedes the eruption, but by frequent repe- tition its effects on the system diminish.; it fails to create an irritation more powerful than the disease to which it is opposed, and consequently the eruption doesr not yield, but during its use is frequently reinforced by fresh crops of papulae. If the eruptive fever, and advanced stage of the disease, are imprudently and suddenly arrested by the use of mercury, by exposure to cold, or by other means, inflammation of the iris or joints often follows, of a very violent form, and not to be easily moderated. No one thinks of re- pelling measles or other eruptive diseases, lest affec- tion of internal organs supervene ; and for the same reason, every precaution must be used to allow this form of eruption to take its own course, while we merely regulate the constitutional symptoms as they obtrude.

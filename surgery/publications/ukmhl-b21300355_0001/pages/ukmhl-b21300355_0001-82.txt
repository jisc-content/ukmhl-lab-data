62 ON mohtification. sloughing, or when no sloughing has taken place, in external or internal inflammations, extravasations, &c.; by diarrhoea, vomiting, and in hopeless cases, more especially of traumatic gangrene, by delirium and coma ; in fact, almost all the symptoms of severe con- stitutional irritation are more or less fully developed. In some cases, the patients are restless and unma- nageable ; in others, low and dejected. The disease often proceeds with fearful rapidity to a fatal ter- mination, the patient, becoming comatose from effu- sion within the cranium ; but in other instances, in which the vigour of the constitution is greater, and the extent of mischief less, the system bears up under the affection, and a separation is effected between the dead and living parts. The danger is in general to be estimated by a consideration of the size and importance of the part, and of the age and consti- tution. The destructive consequences of sphacelus arise both from a local and general cause, for the mere application of putrid animal substance to a part still alive, causes inflammation, attended with symp- toms of diminished power, and followed by consti- tutional disturbance ; whilst the ultimate extinction of life may be imputed to the effect produced on the system by the part previously to its becoming sphace- lated, and to the symjjathy between the system and the parts which are left in a weak and moribund condition, and which seem endowed with a disposi- tion to propagate the disease. In the TiiEATMENT of mortification, no one would think of using any means, local or general, so long

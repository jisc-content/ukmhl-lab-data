AFFECTIONS OF THE ARTERIAL SYSTEM. 153 successful, it was only after a tedious perseverance in its use, and long confinement of the patient. The operation of applying a ligature on the vessel at a distance from the tumour, and thus intercepting or weakening the flow of blood into the cavity, so as to allow complete coagulation to take place, is of comparatively modern invention, and is the one now practised with almost invariable success. This ope- ration has been variously modified. Some have em- ployed the temporary application of the ligature, con- ceiving that the effects produced will be as complete and permanent w^hen it has been only allowed to remain for a certain time, as when it is left undis- turbed and ultimately separated by nature. Such a theory, however, has proved to be incorrect in most of the instances in which it has been reduced to practice in the human subject; and the operation is at best very uncertain, and not to be relied on. Others have employed a double ligature, and those of the continental surgeons are numerous ; some are tightened, others are left loose. A thick broad liga- ture like tape has also been used, from an ill-grounded apprehension, that the coats of the artery would be cut through by the tight application of a thin and firm one. Such complications can do no good, and may do much mischief. The artery must be greatly detached from its surrounding connexions before the ligatures can be applied, in consequence of which, its coats Vill slough, and haemorrhage occur. When, from any cause, the vessel has been detached to a greater extent than is sufficient for the passing of

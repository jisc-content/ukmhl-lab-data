ON SUPPURATION. 50 as by the knife. The indolent and callous surface of the sore is thereby destroyed, and the effects are similar to those which have been already mentioned, when speaking of the use of potass in abscess ; in fact, by its application the sinus is transformed into an acute abscess. Foreign bodies, such as diseased bones, must be early removed ; for it is to be remembered that these are much more frequently the cause than the consequence of suppuration. The healing of an abscess which has been opened, closely resembles the process of union in a flesh wound ; granulations arise, attended by the secretion of pus, the cavity gradually contracts, the surrounding effusion is absorbed along with a portion of the adipose matter; and on the granulations reaching the surface, new skin is formed, and the parts cicatrize. After abscesses have been opened, the fomentations and poultices are to be continued, but only for a limited time. The power of the system must be carefully supported by the admission of pure air; by nourishing food ; by the exhibition of wine, tonics, and such medicines as promote di^f^'tion. In cases where the system is unusually inert, it maybe proper to administer stimulants. The most powerful stimu- lants are frequently necessary, and by steady perse- verance in the use of them, patients have often been saved' in very hopeless circumstances. Great at- tention must be paid to the boM'els, for on these the state of the constitution materially depends. The internal use of cantharides is often advantageous in chronic suppurations and abscesses, but it is

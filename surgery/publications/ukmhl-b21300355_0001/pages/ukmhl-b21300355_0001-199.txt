Some tumours are smooth; others, lobulated or tuberculated. ^ Of Encephaloid Tumours, ; The tumour which we shall next describe, is decidedly malignant. It is the Encephaloid, or the medullary sarcoma. This tumour consists of a homogeneous matter, resembling the substance of the brain in colour and consistence. It rarely has a? distinct cyst, occasionally it is subdivided by liga- mentous bands. It is always soft, though often more so in some parts than in others ; portions of it being frequently so much softened and broken down, as to resemble purulent matter in consistence, and these are generally of a darker colour, from being mixed with a greater or less quantity of blood. Partial or universal softening only occurs after the tumour has existed for some time, for in its original state its structure and density are uniform throughout, and on making a section of it, some few drops of blood may escape from vessels, the coats of which are of a very delicate nature. Some of these vessels seem to give way, in consequence of the process of softening, for we frequently meet with fluid blood, or masses of fibrine, in the midst of the pulpy matter; and when the softening has been extensive, the blood is diffused throughout the whole substance of the tumour, so that it will appear to be chiefly, or entirely, composed of degenerated blood.

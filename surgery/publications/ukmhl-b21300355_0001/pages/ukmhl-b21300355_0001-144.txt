OF INFLAMMATION OF BONE, 124 to keep the wound open, by proper dressings, till all the dead portions of bone be discharged, and every- part of the parietes of the cavity produce healthy granulations; and if the discharge be offensive, its foetor may be corrected by the use of spiritous appli- cations, such as the tincturae myrrhae, opii, aloes, &c. separately or combined. After healthy granulations have appeared, and the cavity has begun to contract, light dressing is all that is necessary. In operating on the carpal and tarsal bones for removal of caries, the surgeon ought to be acquainted with the connexions and relations of the parts. If one bone is diseased, its removal will be sufficient; if several, the operation becomes more painful and difficult. When one of the tarsal or carpal bones is almost completely destroyed, and the surfaces of those arti- culated with it are also more or less affected, it is not sufficient or safe merely to remove the loosely attached portions of the one primarily attacked ; the diseased parts of those surrounding it must also be taken away, and it will often be necessary to apply the caustic afterwards. In caries of the distal range of bones, the bases of those supported by them are in general involved, and must be also removed. If one only is diseased, with the base of the metacarpal or metatarsal bone attached to it, the removal of these will be enough, and can be accomplished without difficulty. Some have recommended the total extir- pation of a metacarpal or metatarsal bone, leaving the finger or toe appended ; but these, when thus left.

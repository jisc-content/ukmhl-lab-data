150 OF INFLAMMATION, AND OTHER the circulation is continued; as by their anastomosis with collateral branches which arise below the seat of the tumour, a portion of the fluid is brought back into the canal of the original artery. The circumstance of collateral enlargement was distinctly shown in amputation, one of the old cures for the disease. The tumour may be suddenly increased by a por- tion of the parietes giving way, and the blood being propelled into the cellular tissue, which becomes thereby condensed, and supplies the deficiency in the original sac. The disease is generally accompanied with great pain, the neighbouring nerves being much stretched by the enlargement of the tumour, as in the axilla or ham ; in these situations also the limb below the aneurism is much swollen from the compression of the absorbents and veins. Diffused aneurism from wounds, and the other species of the disease, will be afterwards treated of. The peculiar degeneration of the coats of the ves- sels has been already stated to be the predisposing cause of aneurism ; and the disease may be directly caused by over-excitement of the circulation, or by an over-exertion of the muscles. It is more frequent in males than females. In men somewhat advanced in life the arteries get hard and rigid, whilst at the same time the muscles are strong, the general health good, and the whole frame stout and active; so that the patient is capable of severe muscular action, such as the arteries are ill able to bear, and consequently the internal coat of a vessel yields, and lays the founda- tion for an aneurism. The lower limbs being chiefly

290 OF ULCERS OF THE GENITAL ORGANS, Another form of eruption which occasionally, though much less frequently, results from either of the above mentioned sores, is the pustular. It is pre- ceded by fever, and consists of rather large pustules, separated from one another, and not very numerous. After their apices give way, and the contained pus is discharged, a thin scab is formed, and on its separa- tion a small ulcer is left, which in general soon heals from its margins, leaving a dark-coloured spot to mark its situation. The papular and pustular erup- tions are sometimes blended, a few pustules appearing amongst numerous papulae, or vice versa. The pus- tular disease is not of frequent occurrence, and in proportion as it approaches the papular with desqua- mation, it becomes milder and more easily removed. In it, as in the papular, mercury proves injurious. The phagedenic form is the most dreadful and unmanageable of all; most uncertain in progress, and direful in event, and often rendered still more de- structive by the mode of treatment adopted. Fortu- nately, it is now seldom seen, though not long ago it was well known as a perpetrator of dreadfid havoc under the name of black pox. It is a corroding ulcer, without hardness of the surrounding parts, presenting no appearance of re- generation of the parts which have been destroyed. It may arise either from a pustule or from abrasion. Sometimes it destroys the prepuce and glans in a few days, at others it spreads deceitfully, healing at one part, and destroying at another. The ulceration is often deep, penetrating the corpora cavernosa, or the

ON INFLAMMATION. 30 Diaphoretics are of essential service in promoting tlie action of the exhalants, and thereby relieving the affected capillaries. The exhibition of opium is fre- quently advantageous, more especially after depletion, in allaying the painful sensations when severe; and also in procuring refreshing sleep, when the patient is anxious and restless. Digitalis has been adminis- tered, with the view of reducing the arterial action ; but it has been fully established, that this medicine acts at first as a direct stimulant, and that it is only after its use has been continued for some time, that its effects become, sedative. The local applications to an inflamed part may be hot or cold. The latter will perhaps be at first the more grateful to the sensations of the patient; but wai*m fomentations are more useful; they relieve the pain more effectually, and at the same time promote the cutaneous transpiration. During an inflammatory attack, the patient should be allowed very little food, and what he does receive must contain little nutriment in proportion to its bulk. But in many cases it is unnecessary to enjoin such abstinence, as the patient has no appetite, and refuses food. In inflammation of deeply-seated parts, such as the apparatus of some articulations, it is a frequent mode of assisting the completion of resolution to excite in- flammatory action in an external, and consequently less vital and important part. This is accomplished by the application of stimuli, caustics, cautery, setons, . &c.

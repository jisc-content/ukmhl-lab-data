AND THEIH CONSEQUENCES. 305 measures to prevent it from being interrupted, and merely moderating such violent symptoms as may precede or accompany it. In the imstular form of eruption, the general treat* ment is the same as in the papular. Mercury is hurt- ful, and increases the tendency to burrow. When the surface is nearly covered v^ith pustules and ulcers in all stages, desquamation may be hastened by fumiga- tions of sulphur, lotions of sulphurate of potass, nitro- muriatic baths, vapour baths, or smearing the affected surface with equal parts of tar and sulphur ointment. In phagedena the patient ought to be, if possible, placed in an airy and healthful situation; in most cases, free blood-letting may be necessary at the commence- ment, and will be advantageously followed by purga- tives and antimonials. The patient ought tobe strictly confined to his room, and ordered low diet with diluents. Afterwards, the internal use of nitric acid, the decoc- tion of sarsaparilla, and an occasional dose of Dover's powder at night, will be beneficial, particularly if sleep be disturbed with pain of the bones and joints. Mer- cury, even in small quantities, protracts the disease^ and in large doses it hastens the ulceration and slough- ing. When all febrile symptoms have subsided, when the ulcers are nearly healed, when no fresh pustules appear, and when desquamation is begun, alterative doses of mercury, as a blue pill, every second night, will tend to hasten the cure, and will not be followed by any unpleasant symptoms. In fact, in all scaly eruptions, whether scaly from their commencement, or having become so in their u

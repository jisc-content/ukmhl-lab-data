A TUMOUR is a swelling of new production, and not a part of the original composition of the body. Blood may have been effused, and the coagulated part, becoming organized, is increased in size by deposits from the vessels which enter it; and its structure and growth are modified according to the action which its own vessels assume, independently of the surround- ing vascular system. The blood-vessels and nerves may enter this new growth by a narrow pedicle, or it may be of such a form as to present an extensive surface, by which it communicates with the surround- ing parts, receiving vascular ramifications from them ; it may originate in blood accidentally effused, or in the coagulating lymph which has been deposited by a morbid action of the vessels. As the growth of the tumour proceeds, the surrounding parts yield, are condensed, and form an envelope for the new forma- tion ; the neighbouring blood-vessels are excited to a greater degree of action, and more blood is poured into the vessels of the tumour; these in their turn become more vigorous, and the increase of the new growth is more and more rapid. Morbid enlarge- ment, or rather new productions, often attain an enormous size; some have weighed, when recent,

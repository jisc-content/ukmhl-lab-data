OF TUMOURS. 177 afterwai'ds experienced vary according to the character which the tumour assumes. Certain changes may- occur in its texture, though not in its general cha- racter or disposition ; thus osseous or earthy matter is occasionally deposited in some part of the tumour, while the surrounding adipose substance retains its appearance and density. In consequence of inflam- mation being excited, it occasionally suppurates. Of Fibrous Tumours. F^bro^lsi\xmo^xrs, are not uncommon, and are formed in various textures. In general, they are composed of a substance of a dirty grey colour and consider- able density, through which minute, firm, ligament- ous fibres ramify, in some cases irregularly, in others radiating from the centre of the tumour. The new formation is surrounded by condensed cellular tissue, to which it intimately adheres, and does not mingle irregularly with the surrounding parts, in this re- spect differing from malignant tumours, which occa- sionally contain fibrous matter. It cannot be con- sidered of an equally innocuous nature with those already described, but is still, in its original state, not of a malignant disposition. After some time, the consistence and structure of such tumours vary; some are of a loose texture and contain cells, others are hard, and intermixed with cartilaginous matter, or even with bone.

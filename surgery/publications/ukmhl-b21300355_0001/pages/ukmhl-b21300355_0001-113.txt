THE SYNOVIAL MEMBRANES. 9S The swelling is often irregular, being more protu- berant at one part than another, from the fluid or the addition of solid matter being accumulated where the least resistance is afforded ; but the slighter inequali- ties are generally filled up hy oedema of the cellular texture. As the disease proceeds, matter forms in the joint, and is often attended with great pain and fever ; or the pus is effused into the bursae, into the surrounding cellular tissue, or into that beneath the tendinous sheaths of the muscles in the neighbour- hood ; and being allowed to remain without an outlet, at length communicates with the cavity of the joint. Portions of the cartilages are absorbed, though this ^Iso occurs at the very commencement of the disease ; the subjacent bone becomes affected by ulceration, or perhaps its vitality is partially destroyed. When matter has accumulated, a portion of the capsular ligament generally ulcerates, the pus escapes, and is, ultimately discharged externally. Some have endeavoured to draw a distinction betwixt those cases in which the disease commences in the cartilage, and those in which the synovial mem- brane is primarily affected; such knowledge, how- ever, can be of no practical utility. When the disease begins with swelling which is of a chronic character, and produces but little inconvenience, and when the more urgent symptoms supervene after the swelling has continued for a considerable time, there is every reason to suppose that the disease has originated in the synovial membrane. But when the first symptoms have been pain and stiffness of the joint, without

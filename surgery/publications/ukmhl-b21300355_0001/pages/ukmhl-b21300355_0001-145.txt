AND DISEASES THENCE ARISING. 125 can never become of any service to the patient, and may be productive of much inconvenience ; whilst removal of them, along with the diseased bone, ren- ders the operation much more easy of execution. If the whole disease can be extirpated, leaving the sur- faces of the surrounding bones covered with healthy cartilage, the use of the cautery is not required, and would be productive of harm ; but wherever it is im- possible to avoid encroaching on the cancellated tex- ture, such as of the os calcis, which it would be unsafe or imprudent to take away entirely, its use is then in- dispensable. After the removal of carious bones, the symptoms soon disappear, and the patient obtains a rapid, and often permanent cure. The instruments for these operations, and the method of performing them, will be afterwards mentioned. The temporary cicatrix of a sore leading to the diseased bone has a very different appearance from the sound scar which is formed after their removal. The former is bluish, soft, on a level with the surrounding parts, and move- able ; the latter is depressed, white, and firmly adhe- rent to the bone. Death of Bone, or Necrosis, is an effect of vio- lent inflammation or external injury; a termination of inflammatory action in bone corresponding to spha- celation in the softer tissues. It has been observed, that the bones are not extensively supplied with blood- vessels, and that their natural powers are inferior to those of the softer parts ; and from this circumstance the frequency of necrosis can be readily accounted for.

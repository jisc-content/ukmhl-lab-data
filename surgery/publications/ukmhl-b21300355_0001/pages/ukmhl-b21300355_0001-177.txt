AFFECTIONS OF THE ARTERIAL SYSTEM. 157 branches after obstructiori of the principal vessels. Such delay prolongs the patient's sufferings, which are in many cases extremely acute, and the precaution is altogether unnecessary, as has been amply proved by experience. On the same principle, the previous appli- cation of pressure to the vessel has been recommended, but few surgeons, if any, are now afraid of trusting to the resources of Nature when the principal vessel of a limb is obliterated, and that suddenly, without previous dilatation of the anastomosis. Cases are on record, in which the abdominal aorta has been com- pletely obstructed without much impeding the infe- rior circulation; and in one remarkable instance of this description, the inconvenience was so slight, that the disease was not suspected during the life of the patient, the lower limbs retaining their usual size and activity. In the plethoric, it may sometimes be pru- dent to abstract blood previously to the operation. When the ligatm'e is placed immediately below a col- lateral branch of considerable size, a bloody coagulum is not formed, though adhesion may occur; but if the inflammatory action extend to the collateral branch, and its canal become thereby obliterated, a coagulum is speedily deposited. In consequence of the enlargement of the anastomosing branches, and the increasing circulation in them, pulsation gene- rally returns in the tumour, to a slight degree, some days after the operation. This, however, is by no means a sign that the operation has been ineffectual; for the renewed pulsation almost always disappears in the course of a very short time. In one instance

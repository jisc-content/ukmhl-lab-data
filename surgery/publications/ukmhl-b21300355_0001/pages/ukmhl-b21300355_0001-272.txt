OF WOUNDS. 252 appearances usually observed after death are marks of inflammation of the pharynx and air passages, and of the mucous surface of the stomach and intestines. It is evident that the disease ought to be prevented if possible, and for its prevention the most efficient mea- sure is timely excision of the affected parts ; when excision is dangerous, or wholly impracticable, and when the patient does not apply soon after the acci- dent, the injured parts may be destroyed by potass. The removal of parts wounded by snakes, even after violent symptoms have appeared, has proved success- ful, ammonia having been at the same time adminis- tered internally. In some instances arsenic has been found efficacious when given in large doses, and fre- quently repeated. Wounds received during dissection occasionally have unpleasant consequences from the absorption of putrid animal matter. The absorbents leading from the wounded part become swelled and painful, and in slight cases there are shivering and general indispo- sition for some days. The more violent symptoms arise from examining bodies which are rather recent, and in which putrefaction is just commencing, and very frequently from inspecting the bodies of females who have died of puerperal diseases. The absorption may take place from punctures made by scissors, the point of a knife, or spiculae of bone, or from old scratches, or chops by the side of the nail or on the hand. There is little or no danger from an open and bleeding wound, as by the flow of blood the part is completely cleaned ; it is only from slight punctures

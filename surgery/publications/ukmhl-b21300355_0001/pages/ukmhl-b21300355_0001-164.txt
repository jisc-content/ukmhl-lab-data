144 OF INFLAMMATION, AND OTHER its symptoms have been minutely detailed; but its occurrence seems to be extremely rare, and the treat- ment is medical. Inflammation is supposed to precede degeneration of the arterial coats. As a person advances in life, the ai'teries lose elasticity, and the heart its balance with them ; either the one or the other becomes dilated, their parietes are thickened, and the valves are altered in structure ; the enlargement of the ves- sels is generally greatest towards their origin. The dilatation of arteries, more especially of the internal ones, is often very great; ultimately the internal coat gives way, and the external, with the surrounding tissues, yields in proportion as the blood diflfuses itself. Previously to the rupture of the internal tunic, there is, in most cases, a morbid alteration in the textui'e of the vessel. The internal coat becomes dry; its texture is more dense and less elastic, and, conse- quently, more brittle. Morbid matter is deposited between the middle and internal coats, and this, by stretching the latter still further, diminishes the elas- ticity and cohesion of their texture. The deposit is at first to a slight extent and of soft consistence, some- what resembling condensed fatty matter, and hence termed Steatomatous. Afterwards, it increases in quantity and consistence, becoming, instead of soft and yielding, dense, hard, and incompressible, in short, calcareous. Though the morbid deposit is at first confined, as above related, its limits are afterwards extended;

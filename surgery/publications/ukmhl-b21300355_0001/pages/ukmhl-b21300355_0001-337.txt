OF SCALDS AND BURNS. 317 state is obviated by the employment of cordials or stimulants. But these ought to be administered with caution, for reaction soon commences, and often in- creases to well-marked inflammation, requiring for counteraction low diet, and even bleeding. In such cases gentle laxatives are preferable to purgatives, as by the latter the patient is obliged to make fi'equent movements, and those are always painful. Stimulants have been strongly recommended, at first powerful, and afterwards gradually weaker, so as to restore the balance between the affected parts and the system; and the latter is again to be excited, in order to meet the increased action which the parts assume. The practice is founded on fancy, and cannot become ge- neral, being in its first part cruel, and in its second foolish. Whilst debility exists, stimulate cautiously, when overaction ensues, adopt those measures which are best calculated to subdue excitement; this is com- mon sense, and the common practice. During the process of healing, position of the parts ought to be carefully attended to; contraction of the cicatrices, and cohesion of opposed surfaces often causing un- seemly deformities. Surfaces opposed to each other, and naturally separate, may be prevented from uni- ting by dressing interposed ; and contraction of joints is to be guarded .against by keeping the limb extended by splints and bandages. Where deformity has oc- curred the hardened cicatrix which is in fault may be either divided or excised, and by approximating the edges of the wound as much as possible, and 6

225 or WOUNDS. OF WOUNDS. ^ 7 These are various, according to their extent, and the instrument by which they are inflicted. The violence attending the injury, and the nature and importance of the parts divided, or in the neighbour- hood of the wound, must all be studied, for on these circumstances depend the accurate knowledge and judicious treatment of the case. Wounds have been divided into incised, punctured, and bruised; that is, inflicted by a sharp-edged, sharp-pointed, or an obtuse body. In the first kind, there is greater or less effu- sion of blood, according to the size and number of the vessels divided. Some extend but a little way beyond the subcutaneous cellular tissue, and are consequently attended with but slight bleeding; others penetrate to a greater depth, and occasion haemorrhage, from a large vessel wounded, or other alarming symptoms, by having penetrated into an important organ ; and others, though not of so great a depth as the former, may still, on account of their mere extent, be accom- panied with very considerable loss of blood. It is seldom that fatal effects immediately follow external wounds; but they may, and do occur, when blood- vessels of the first class are cut. They are most likely to prove suddenly fatal when the arteries are only partially divided, and when these are accompanied with large veins. When the artery is cut through, its extremities retract, effusion takes place into the sheath, and compresses the orifice, and thus the for- p

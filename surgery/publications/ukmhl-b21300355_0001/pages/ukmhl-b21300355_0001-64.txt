ON SUPPURATION. 44 is well entitled to the term anodyne, which is usually- applied to others of a complicated, and not more efficacious, character. Poultices are of material ser- vice, particularly when the collection has become maturated ; and their composition is of little import- ance, provided they are moist, warm, and soft. Their use, however, may be continued too long; for after an abscess has given way, the suppuration may ex- tend in consequence of the continued use of the poul- tice, which prorhotes such action; the opening will enlarge, the skin become undermined, loose, and flab- by, the abscess will extend, while the process of granu- lation will be in a great measure suspended. In many , cases, the poultice must be discontinued before a natu- ral opening has been formed, for the cure is often much accelerated by the artificial evacuation of the matter. When the abscess is situated deeply, or beneath a fascia, a free and early opening must be made. For example, when suppuration has occurred in the cel- lular tissue beneath the fascia lata of the thigh, it at first naturally tends towards the surface, but its progress is impeded by the tendinous aponeurosis; a painful feeling of tension is thereby occasioned, and the matter extends where there is the least resistance, making its way in all directions into the surrounding cellular tissue—separating the muscles—isolating the arterial trunks—burrowing beneath the fascia over the whole limb, and producing most serious, and of- ten irreparable mischief, with violent constitutional disturbance. The bad effects of delay are daily wit- \ nessed in neglected cases of paronychia ; most excru-

A great variety of remedies are employed, spiritous, watery, acid, alkaline, cold, hot,&c.; in fact, every practitioner, and almost every individual, possesses a favourite application for this so common an accident.

Perhaps the most common applications are, a mixture of lime- water and olive oil, and the ceratum acetatis plumbi. The vesicles, when left to themselves, burst, expose an irritable surface, and the acrid discharge from them excoriates the surrounding skin. Their con- tents ought to be evacuated by a small puncture, and the cuticle being left carefully undisturbed, a scab soon forms, by which the part is protected while healing.

AND DISEASES THENCE ARISING. 129 pelas of the leg. The matter is in general thick and laudable; at first it is secreted in small quantity, but afterwards more profusely. The external openings, through which it is discharged, are found to lead to cloaccB^ or apertures in the new bone which encases the old, and through these the dead portions can be discovered by the probe ; and it will thus be. ascertain- ed whether the sequestrum is fixed or detached ; when loose, it can often be moved upward and downward in the cavity. When the shaft of a bone is affected, the whole limb is much enlarged, by the inflammar tion having extended to a considerable distance above and below the necrosed portion. The unshapely appearance of the limb continues until the sequestra be discharged ; for by their presence incited action is continued, and only subsides after their removal. Previously, however, great effusion of new bone has, in general, occurred; thus a preparation has been made for the strengthening of the limb, which, after a considerable portion of its thickness has been des- troyed, would be incapable of supporting the weight of the body; and from this circumstance it can never completely regain its proper appearance. Its unna- tural bulk is often much diminished, for the new bone gradually becomes consolidated and smooth on the surface by the action of the absorbents. Nature seems to construct her substitute after the model of the original, and in some instances but very little change can afterwards be observed in the limb. In external necrosis, death of the outer lamella, reparation is chiefly made by the subjacent parts; I

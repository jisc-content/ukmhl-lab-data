ON INFLAMMATION. 9 In extravasation of blood into the cellular texture, as under the conjunctiva, there is redness, swelling, and occasionally pain ; but at first, and unless the action of the blood-vessels be excited, there vi^ill be neither heat nor throbbing. In many internal inflammations, heat is much complained of; and in Enteritis, it has been considered a pathognomonic symptom. The symptoms and consequences of inflammation —and amongst others, heat—are modified by the dis- tance of the affected part from the centre of circula- tion. All actions, healthy as well as morbid, proceed with more vigour in the superior extremities,—the head, the neck, and the trunk,—than in the more remote parts of the body; for to the former the blood is transmitted more speedily if not in greater quanti- ty, and is not so liable to be impeded in its return. Hence an arm may bear up under a severe injury, which, to an inferior, extremity, would prove inevi- table destruction. Heat, however, in an inflamed part, is to be regarded rather as a sensation^ than as an absolute increase of temperature. For it has been proved by the most decided experiments, on the tem- perature of the mucous canals of animals, first when in health, and again after violent inflammation had been excited, that little or no variation of tempera- ture can be observed. The effects of an incited action of the vessels on the system at large, must now be adverted to; or, in other words, that general disturbance in the system which attends inflammatory incitation, and occurs in a degree proportioned to the power of the exciting

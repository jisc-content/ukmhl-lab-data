OF WOUNDS. 2S2 the speedy formation of coagula, by which the hae- morrhage is arrested until the orifices of the vessel be permanently closed by the adhesive process. Thus, in instances where the whole of an extremity has been torn off, the patients have lost but a very small quantity of blood. From wounds of veins the blood flows, not in a sub- saltatory, but in a uniform stream, its colour is dark, and the flow is easily suppressed. Placing a ligature on a vein is dangerous, and to be scrupulously avoided. The process of reparation, besides, in a wounded vein, is different from that in an artery. Veins are less disposed to the secreting action by which adhesion is perfected; and when inflamed, the inflammation is extremely apt to extend along the coats of the vessel; which latter circumstance has been ascribed to the great proportion of cellular tissue in their coats. When punctured longitudinally, the lips of the wound remain in contact, and cicatrisation, by means of effused lymph, is soon effected; in fact, the wound heals by the first intention. But if opened obliquely or transversely, not to a great extent, the immediate result is discharge of blood, and, when this has ceased, a coagulum forms in the wound, the margins of which remain separate; and this coagulum generally com- municates with blood effused into the sheath of the vessel. After some time, the lips of the wound encircling the coagulum, which occupies the aperture, and which has temporarily averted the hcemorrhage, become somewhat turgid, and increased in vascu- lai'ity; they then appear to assume a secreting action,

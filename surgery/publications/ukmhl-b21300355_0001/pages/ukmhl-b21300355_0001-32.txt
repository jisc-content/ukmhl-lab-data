ON INFLAMMATION. 12 derangement in function and structure will apparently be almost entirely disregarded by the constitution. Iri'itation is an effect of sympathy, and differs from inflammation, inasmuch as the functions of the ner- vous system, and not those of the sanguiferous, are disturbed ;â€”the latter frequently supervenes on the former. Irritation is local, or constitutional. As ex- amples of the strictly local species, may be mentioned that peculiar and dreadfully annoying sensation pro- duced in the alveoli by the presence of a diseased tooth, or the irritation caused by ascarides in the rec- tum, or by stone in the bladder. But from this action being dependent on the ner- vous agency, irritation is frequently produced in a part remote from the source of the action. Thus, if an irritating cause of any kind be applied to the origin of a nerve, the effects of the irritation may be evinced in a part supplied by its extreme branches; while, if the cause is applied to the termination of a nerve, a similar action is produced at its commence- ment, and in parts supplied by nerves from the same origin. Thus, disease of the hip-joint causes pain in the knee, whilst dentition in children not unfre- quently produces fatal effusion at the base of the brain ; and again, irritation at the neck of the bladder frequently gives rise to pain in the feet. Local impressions, injuries, or irritations, though ' apparently of little importance, frequently produce irritation which affects the whole system, and is there- fore termed comtitutional. Syncope sometimes fol- lows the introduction of a bougie along the urethra.

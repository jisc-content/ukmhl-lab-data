ON SUPPUllATION. 36 with the sore. Some have supposed that the mere admission of air into the cellular substance causes suppuration ; but this is far from being correct. In chronic purulent depots, however, the admission of air often produces most serious results, as will be afterwards more fully explained. Pus was formerly regarded as irritating and cor- roding, and was therefore carefully removed from every granulating sore ; but purulent matter, though it may prove a source of irritation to the neigh- bouring parts, does not disturb the surface which secretes it, but, on the contrary, protects the tender granulations, and acts as a temporary cuticle,â€”the thinner part evaporating, and a crust being thus formed. We frequently see small sores healing rapidly when protected by such a crust; and we, in some instances, adopt the hint given to us by nature, and produce a scab by the application of powders, lunar caustic, &c. An ingenious theory has been given as to the formation of tubes in the coagulated pus, in consequence of the effusion of carbonic acid, and these tubes being afterwards filled with red blood; but such theorising, it is presumed, will not stand the test of experience. The discharge does not always consist of laudable piu'ulent matter, but degenerates, in consequence of disturbance of the con- stitution, or of the part affected. It is also frequent- ly suppressed, in consequence of overaction in the vessels of the part, or from debility, partial or gene- ral. Suppression of a purulent discharge is to be regarded as an untoward symptom, fraught with

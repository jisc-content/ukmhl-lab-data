134 OF POllCELLANOUS DEPOSIT. ture has taken place, when the health has been under- mined, or when neighbouring joints have become diseased, amputate, in order to save the life, if it is impossible to save the limb. It is almost superfluous to remark, that leeching and blistering are worse than useless after necrosis has occurred, however useful they may be in pre- venting it; and that the adoption of measures to promote the dissolution and absorption of the seques- tra are glaringly absurd. Necrosis, after amputation, was formerly frequent; but in the present improved state of this operation it is so rare as not to be entitled to separate considera- tion. A peculiar matter is occasionally secreted by the blood-vessels of bones, more particularly of their extremities which form part of the articulation of a joint, and it has been termed Poiicei.lanous Deposit. When this matter has been deposited, we find, on examining, that the cartilage on the extremity of the bone is in general of its healthy appearance, except at certain points where its situa- tion is occupied by a smooth and dense substance; it is extremely hard, and its surface is of a polished appearance, resembling tliat of marble. In general the deposition is not extensive. Sometimes it would seem that the cartilage has been absorbed, and that the deficiency has been filled by effusion of the por- cellanous matter; in other instances this seems to be deposited in a thin stratum external to the car-

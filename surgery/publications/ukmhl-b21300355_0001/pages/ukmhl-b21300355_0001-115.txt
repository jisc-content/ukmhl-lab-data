THE SYNOVIAL MEMBRANES. 95 the articulating extremity of the bone is not enlarged, still that portion which is more immediately concerned in the articulation is often considerably expanded. Frequently when the knee is the seat of the disease, the lymphatic glands in the groin are enlarged; and when the elbow or wrist joints are aifected, there is often a similar enlargement of the glands in the axilla: such glandular tumors have not rarely been confounded with those accompanying malignant dis- ease, and measures which were absolutely necessary for the salvation of the patient, have thus been delayed or neglected. When the disease has been of considerable dura- tion, hectic fever supervenes, and is aggravated after the abscesses give way. The patient becomes much weakened and emaciated, and loses his appetite; the pulse is rapid, with night sweats, diarrhoea, &c.; and from a continuation of the hectic cause, the life is endangered. In some cases, however, the health is restored, and the disease abates spontaneously; in others, the disease is arrested, and a complete cure accomplished, by the careful employment of such means as will be afterwards mentioned. A method of cure, resorted to by nature, and in which she may be assisted by the surgeon, is Anchy- losis, ligamentous or osseous. New bone is deposited in the neighbourhood of the disease, whereby the ulcers become, as it were, cicatrized, and the articu- lating extremities of the bones are joined to each other by a firm osseous union, either universal, or composed of processes extending between the bones at various

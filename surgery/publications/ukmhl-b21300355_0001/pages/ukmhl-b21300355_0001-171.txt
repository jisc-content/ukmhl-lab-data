AFFECTIONS OF THE ARTERIAL SYSTEM. 151 subject to such exertions, aneurism in them is most frequent; and for the same reason it is said to be common in those who ride much on horseback. De- generation of the coats of the vessels in the superior extremity is extremely rare. This is another reason why spontaneous aneurism seldom assails them. Treatment.â€”In internal aneurism the only indi- cation which can be followed, with any chance of success, is to favour the occurrence of a spontaneous cure, by abstracting all stimuli, mental and corporeal, by-enjoining complete rest, by keeping the patient on low diet, and by repeated bleeding. Thus the force of the circulation is diminished, and coagulation pro- moted ; by this practice aneurisms, the progress of which defies external means, are occasionally cured. Ice and other cold applications to external aneurisms, or those which have made their way to the surface, have been recommended to induce coagulation, but their use is not unattended with danger ; for they may so far diminish the vitality as to cause sloughing, and fatal haemorrhage. In the treatment of aneurisms exterior to the great cavities, important improvements have been made in modern times. No success can be expected to follow palliative and temporizing measures, and a cure can result only from operation. Formerly it was the practice to lay open the aneurismal tu- mour, and to search for the extremities of the ar- tery opening into the cavity, and to secure them by ligature, or close them by pressure, styptics, or both. In some few instances this had permanent success;

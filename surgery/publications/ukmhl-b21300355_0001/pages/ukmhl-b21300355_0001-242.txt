222 OF TUMOTTRS. . ble. If there is no reason to siij^pose that the tumour is malignant, little or no integument ought to be removed, unless the growth is of a large size; but when malignity is dreaded, all the discoloured, tense, and adherent integument ought to be taken away, and the incisions are to be made at a distance from the disease. In all cases, they ought to commence at the point where the principal vessels enter; these are thus divided at the outset, can be readily secured by ligature, or by the fingers of an assistant, and the dissection is proceeded in without risk of farther haemorrhage. If the opposite course be pursued, the vessels will be divided two or more times during the operation, and thus the performance of it will either be delayed by the application of numerous ligatures, or will be attended with a considerable loss of blood. After the tumour has been exposed, it ought to be principally detached in one direction, and not first cut on one side and then on another, as in this way its removal will be sooner accomplished. If malignant, great care should be taken that all the dis- eased mass be removed, for a minute portion remain- ing may form a nucleus in which similar diseased actions may arise ; and, in most instances, it will be prudent not only to remove the parts actually disea- sed, but those also which are in immediate connexion with the tumour, though at the time they appear healthy. All important parts must be carefully avoid- ed. After removal of the mass, the edges of the wound must be approximated, so as to favour union, by the first intention ; if this fail, granulation must

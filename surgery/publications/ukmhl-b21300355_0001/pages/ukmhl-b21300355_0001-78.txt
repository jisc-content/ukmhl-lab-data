When gangrene follows the tight application of a ligature, the death of the part seems to depend more on obstruction to the circulation of the blood, than on any diminution of the nervous energy, for we do not observe that paralytic limbs are peculiarly liable to gangrene. The surgeon frequently takes advan- tage of the fact, that a part soon dies when its supply of blood is cut off, or its return in the veins inter- rupted ; and has recourse to ligature for removal of parts, when he considers it inexpedient to employ cutting instruments. Mortification may be produced by the above men- tioned causes, either immediately or consecutively; and it will occur in some constitutions, or states of constitution, at some periods of life, in some struc- tures, and in some parts of the body, more readily than in othei's. Inflammatory action is seldom so intense as to ter- minate in death of the part, unless the jiower of that part has been diminished by previous local or consti- tutional disease, or by injury; and the inflannnation preceding gangrene is all along attended by symptoms of so well-marked debility, both local and general,

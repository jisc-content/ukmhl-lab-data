IS ON INFLAMMATION. We meet with too many instances of constitutional irritation following severe injuries or operations, es- pecially if attended with much haemorrhage. In ge- neral, there is considerable prostration of strength; the patient is anxious and restless; his sleep is dis- turbed ; the pulse is weak and fluttering, occasionally intermittent; the tongue is white and loaded ; the appetite is gone ; the stomach rejects the little food which the patient is able to take; he is startled and annoyed by the slightest external impression. It generally happens that at this period of the disorder rigors occur, followed by a sense of heat, and by perspiration ; and that the above symptoms gradual- ly decrease, and the patient recovers ; but in certain instances his breathing becomes quick and somewhat oppressed, attended with a peculiar spasmodic eleva- tion of the nostrils ; all the secretions are diminished, the intellectual functions become impaired, and there are occasional convulsive twitchings ; coma super- venes, preceded by a low muttering delirium, and followed by death. This action, as well as every other, is much modi- fied by the importance of the part which is the source of the action, and by the constitution of the patient. It is more severe in children than in adults. The affection will be more fully detailed, when treating of local injuries, and the management of patients after severe operations. The Causes of Inflammation come next to be con- sidered ; and first, of the proximate cause or theory.

293 OF ULCERS OF THE GENITAL ORGANS, the exposed surface is found to be of a healthy gra- nulating character, contrary to what is observed in the originally phagedenic disease. Buboes, when they occur, have the same malignant action as the primary sore, the breach of surface is extended either by sloughing or by phagedenic ulceration, and the edges of the sore are ragged and undermined. The secondary eruption which follows the phage- denic form, is pustular, though differing from that which has been already noticed. The pustules soon give way, and ulcers remain, covered with thick scales or crusts, which sometimes increase layer by layer, so as to become prominent, dense, and of a conical form. After the separation of the crusts, the ulcers are found superficial, rather unhealthy, and show- ing a disposition to extend, chiefly towards the cir- cumference. When healing, the process of cicatriza- tion frequently proceeds from the centre of the sore, which is still enlarging at its circumference. The reason for this unusual mode seems to be, that ulcera- tion does not commence in the secondary sores till the crusts which cover them have been removed; they then are very superficial, not extending through the thickness of the true skin; and the ulceration does not go on in the centre of the original sore, but towards its margins, so that a portion of true skin remains in the centre of the sore, whilst it is gradu- ally destroyed towards the margins. Then, whilst the surrounding skin, which usually forms the new cutaneous texture necessary for reparation, is gra- dually and progressively destroyed, the remaining

OF TUMOUllS. 194 accounted for; and from the number of vessels which supply the new structure, and which are thus employ- ed, it can be readily imagined that the haemorrhage will be profuse. In many instances, the application of firm pressure on the limb above the seat of the disease is insufficient to arrest the flow of blood ; and though this may, in some degree, be explained, by supposing the continued stream to be venous, still it must be confessed that the disease appears connected with a peculiar hsemorrhagic tendency. Frequently the fungus is found to communicate with, or rather to arise from, numerous cysts of a glossy appearance, from which also blood is copiously effused. The sui-- rounding tissues are completely disorganized in the immediate neighbourhood, and also much altered in structure for a considerable extent around ; the mus* cles, besides their disorganization, have acquired a peculiar brown hue. Sometimes the haemorrhage does not seem to proceed so much from the fungus as from the subjacent cysts ; for when a superficial incision or puncture is made into it, the bleeding is often incon- siderable, and only becomes alarming after masses of coagulated blood have been removed, and the cysts thereby exposed. Occasionally the fungus connnuni- cates with a cavity of enormous size, filled with blood, partly coagulated and partly fluid, and from the parietes of which the haemorrhage proceeds. AVhcn the disease has supervened on a meduUo-sarcomatous tumour, the coagulated blood is mixed with a sub- stance resembling the brain in a state of putrescence. It may supervene on polypous tumours, particularly

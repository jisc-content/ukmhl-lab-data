OF SCALDS AND JiURNS. 314 not severely injured at first, may afterwards perish, violent inflammatory action being excited, which terminates in sloughing. The neighbouring parts have their vitality much diminished, by the direct influence of the injury ; and hence, when these parts come to be the seat of increased action, sloughing almost inevitably ensues, from the want of correspond'- ing power. From the same cause, subsequent sores are tedious in healing, being so far debilitated as to be unable to assume full vigour ; even slight ulcera- tions following vesication contract very slowly ; the granulations are flabby, and the discharge profuse and thin. The inflammation is often very violent, and kept within bounds with difficulty. Burns of the trunk, particularly of the genital organs, are to be con- sidered as attended with much danger. And extensive burns and scalds, wherever situated, are always to be dreaded. Violent constitutional irritation takes place, dyspnoea is apt to occur, with effusion into the chest of serum, or a sero-purulent fluid ; and the nervous system ultimately becomes oppressed. Gfreat sinking of the vital powers is generally the innnediate consequence of extensive and severe burns; there is shivering, weakness of the pulse, cold extremities, anxiety, and vomiting, requiring the exhibition of cordials, opium, and even of strong stimulants. Nor can it be matter of surprise that such serious effects occur, when we reflect on the extreme sensibility, and highly organized state of tlie affected part, and the important functions whidi it is intended to per- form, as well as those sympathies which it holds with

It often follows affections of the lower limbs, as of the knee or hip-joint; and is also caused by shortening of a limb, which has been negligently or ineffectually treated after fracture during childhood, or by the patient being allowed to continue a custom of standing awk- wardly on one leg. At first, during slight curvature from such causes, the spine can be brought into its original straight position by the voluntary action of its muscles. After some time, however, the curve cannot be remedied by any effort, interstitial absorp- tion occurs in the bones, and they become changed in form, and the muscles accommodate themselves to the new position, as also do the various liga- ments connected with the spinal column. When the curvature is seated in the dorsal vertebrae, it is generally to the right side, the shoulder is raised, and the chest is protruded, whilst the opposite side is depressed and flattened. The clothes hang loose, or fall off" on the left side—the patient rests the weight of his body chiefly on the left leg—on stooping, the right scapula projects, and, on examination, is found to be nearer to the spinous processes of the vertebrae than the left. The left cavity of the chest is dimi- nished, and the ribs press upon the heart and lungs, causing difficulty of breathing. To preserve the balance of the body, a curvature occurs below the former, and in the opposite direction ; and not unfre- ;quently there is a third incurvation situated above the primary one. The bones of the pelvis become distorted, and are

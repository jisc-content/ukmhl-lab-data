OF TUMOURS; 173 wards abate, and ultimately go off entirely ; and du^ ring the increase of the swelling, little or no pain is experienced, unless when these subacute inflamma- tory attacks supervene, and then it is but slight; or unless the enlargement be resisted by an unyielding structure, and then it is highly acute. The size and rapidity of increase in such tumours will vary accord- ing to circumstances; the vessels of the part soon regain their size and action, either by the efforts of nature or of art, so that the tumour will have at- tained no great size, and be stationary in its pro- gress, being denied the materials necessary for its increase. If the morbid action be thus stopped, the absorbents will remove the newly-formed matter, and restore the parts to their healthy condition. But when the deposition proceeds in a superior ratio to absorption, the new matter becomes organized, and, by means of its own vessels, secretes a substance simir- lar to itself, whereby the increase of the tumour be- comes more rapid, and the new structure may attain an enormous bulk. Thus the tumour is formed, not merely by extension of the original tissue, but by the formation of new matter, which, becoming organized, assumes a secreting power. At first the former cir- cumstance is the chief cause of the enlargement; but after the latter process has existed for some time, the tumour loses much of its resemblance to the primary tissue, assumes a more dense structure and a different action, and therefore cannot be designated a simple enlargement. This species of tumour, or rather this enlargement

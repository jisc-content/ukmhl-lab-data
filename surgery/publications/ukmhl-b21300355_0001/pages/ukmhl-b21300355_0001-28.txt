ON INFLAMMATION. 8 the former case, the contractions are universal, and induced through the medium of the nerves. In the latter, the 'mntahility of the fibre is excited. When the circulation is excited, the nerves accom- panying the affected vessels are unusually compress- ed, and perhaps overstimulated by the circulating fluid, in which some change appears to take place; and in this manner unnatural impressions are pro- duced. Overdistension of the coats of the vessels may also be supposed to give rise to painful feelings, independently of any afiection of the accompanying nervous trunks. The degree of pain is generally in proportion to the sensibility of the part when in health; it also depends upon the dist^nsibility of the parts affected, and on the intensity of the inflammatory action. When bones, tendons, &c. which in their uninflamed state are nearly insensible, become inflamed, the pain and suffering are most excruciating, owing to the resistance opposed to the dilatation of the vessels, and the prevention of the effusion by which they natural- ly relieve themselves. The land of pain also varies in consequence of dif- ferent modifications in the action, causing different impressions on the sensorium. Pain is not always in- creased in proportion to the ilatural sensibility of the part; for in some instances the sensibility is render- ed much more intense, whilst in others it is much obtunded. The last, and, according to some writers, the only unequivocal symptom of inflammation, is Heat.

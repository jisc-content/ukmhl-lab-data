OF WOUNDS. 226 mation of a coagulum within the vessel is promoted, and the haemorrhage arrested. But when a portion only of the circumference is divided, the blood conti- nues to flow through the aperture, as if into a smaller ramification of itself, no retraction or contraction of the vessel can occur, coagulation is slow, and the bleeding profuse. I have seen a wound of so small a vessel as the internal mammary prove almost instan- taneously fatal. Wounds of the large internal vessels for the most part prove instantly fatal; as wounds of the heart, or the large vessels passing to and from its cavities, at the root of the lungs, at the upper part of the liver, &c. When the heart, or these vessels, whilst within the pericardium, have been divided, it can be readily understood how life should be imme- diately destroyed, since the blood effused into the cavity of the pericardium by its pressure completely arrests the action of the heart. But occasionally punc- tured wounds, in such situations, have not been fol- lowed by instant death. In such cases, alarming symptoms occur at the time, but subside, and the patient may for some time suffer no uneasiness, but will afterwards expire suddenly during muscular ex- ertion, or perhaps in a fit of violent passion. Blood must have been effused into the pericardium at the first, causing symptoms of, or actual syncope; but then the aperture in the vessel had become obstructed by coagulum before blood had been poured out in such quantity as to effectually prevent the actions of the heart; at a future period, the coagulum gives way, and the subsequent effusion is limited only by

But no one can either doubt or deny that the blood, in its distribution, in its manner of receiving increase, in its secretions, and in its various morbid changes, is governed by certain laws and principles which cannot be explained by those of chemistry or mechanics, but must belong to some other power. The phenomena, also, with which it is endowed, do not occur in the dead subject. It is allowed, and has been promulgated by all authors, that the blood is one of the most active agents in the animal economy,â€”in repairing waste, in affording peculiar fluids necessary in that economy, in supplying organs with materials for carrying on their functions, &c.; and yet all this, according to some, is accomplished by a dead animal fluid ; no one can plausibly object to the laws by which the blood is governed, being referred to the Power of Life, or to their being called Vital Principles. Certain circumstances give rise to inflammation, and have been called \is Exciting Imiuediate Causes. Among the external applications producing inflammation, stimulants bear a conspicuous part; the effects of whiqli in causing this action, are well shown by many experiments that have been performed on the lower animals; by the application of ammonia, for example, to the diaphanous web of a fi'og's foot. As stimulants usually causing inflammatory action, by

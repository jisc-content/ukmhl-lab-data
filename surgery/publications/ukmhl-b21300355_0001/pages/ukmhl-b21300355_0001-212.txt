192 OF TUMOURS. Fungus HcBmatodes Has been much confounded with medullarysarcoma, but the two diseases are materially different. Fungus hsematodes almost always supervenes on other morbid formations, when they have been ulcerated and ex- posed ; and the particular formation which most frequently precedes, is the medullo-sarcomatous; a bleeding fungus, however, occasionally protrudes from tumours of a different character, which, though they may have been at first simple, have degenerated, ulcerated, and assumed a malignant action. The disease certainly does not occur so frequently as some have asserted; for many, instead of limiting the application of the term to those fungous protrusions wliich bleed, honour, with the appellation of fungus hsematodes, every growth which protrudes after the ulceration of a tumour, and every tumour which is unusually prominent, of soft consistence, and of a somewhat fungous appearance, although such have never shown any disposition to bleed, either sponta- neously, or from irritation. But fungus haematodes, as the name implies, is truly a fungus which resembles blood ; and as bloody, or blood-like tumours are formed from the rupture of some vessel of rather a large size, and as they almost invariably evince a tendency to profuse haemorrhage, as a necessary con- sequence of the mode of their formation, the term is correctly applied only to those fungous growths which either have at one time emitted a discharge of blood,, 16

ON INFLAMMATION. 17 It has also been objected, that the circulation is carried on when the arteries are rigid in consequence of calcareous degeneration, and cannot assist in the propulsion of the blood. But when the arteries, throughout the whole extent of a limb, are so chan- ged in structure as not to assist in the circulation of the blood, death of the part is the inevitable conse- quence. The muscular power of arteries may be deduced from the following facts and observations. The larger arteries, after death, are always found, empty. Even after respiration has ceased, the capil- laries remain active, and contract so as to empty themselves into the veins. It has been alleged that other causes may operate in producing this empty state of the arteries—the vis a tergo, and a supposed pumping action of the heart; but consideration of such causes need not detain us. The contractile power of the heart is frequently much diminished by organic disease, without affect- ing, to so great an extent as might be expected, the circulation of the blood in the remote vessels. The heart is altogether wanting in some classes of animals ; and human monsters are occasionally born, and live for some time, without this organ—still the blood is circulated. The different parts of the sanguiferous system may be, at the same moment, in different states of excite- ment—a common example of which is the sudden blush of shame, or the pallid hue of terror. The secretions are all formed from the blood; yet B

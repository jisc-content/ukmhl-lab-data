OF TUMOUES. 2.24 nerating avoided. Frequently, however, a consider- able part of the bone must be removed along with the tumour, since the neighbouring bone is generally softened, and intimately adherent to the diseased part, which it somewhat resembles in structure. In general, regular dissection is unnecessary in the removal of encysted tumours. An incision is made, or an elliptical portion cut out; the contents escape, and the cyst, being then laid hold of by dissecting forceps, is readily separated. In some situations, as on the eyelids, under the tongue, or amongst tendons, the sac is not so easy of extraction; it is then inse- parable, either naturally, or from previous inflam- mation. Caustic is used with safety to destroy those parts which cannot be detached, and for this purpose the potass is to be preferred. When, however, the tumour is large, a part of the integuments covering it must be removed, otherwise a large cavity will be left, in which pus will accumulate. In this case, the base of the tumour is to be surrounded by two ellip- tical incisions, and the cyst dissected out entire, lea- ving only integument sufficient to cover the exposed surface. In the smaller tumours, it is vain to attempt regular dissection ; a portion of the cyst will be left, and the disease reproduced: whereas, by using the potass, the operation is much more speedy, and always successful. The making a minute aperture, and squeezing out the contents, is at best but a pal- liative measure, and is often followed by severe con- stitutional disturbance.

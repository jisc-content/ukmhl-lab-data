306 OF ULCERS OF THE GENITAL ORGANS, latter stages and previously to their disappearance, mercury, pmdently administered, will be useful by expediting the cure, and not injurious by deranging the system. The tar or citrine ointments may be applied to the eruptions and cutaneous ulcers. For the ulcers of the throat, unless in a sloughing state, the lunar stone appears to be almost a specific, removing the irritability of the sores, and jn-otecting them from fui'ther irritation by coagulating the dis- charge, which then more effectually covers and protects them; the application requires to be repeated everj'^ second or third day, as by the frequent and necessary motions of the parts, the crust loosens and separates, leaving the surface exposed and irritable. At the same time the sore will contract very considerably under each successive crust. The lunar stone may also be applied in solution ; or a solution of the muriate of mercury with spirits or laudanum may be used, in the proportion of from four to six grains to the ounce, or stronger. Fumigation of the throat with the red Â¥ sulphuret of mercury, has been extolled as a power- ful means of checking the alternating sloughing and ulceration, which often accompany the ulcers of these parts, but the propriety of its use is doubtful; the system is thereby rapidly put under the influence of mercury,wliich, as already remarked, generally aggra- vates the violent disturbance under which the consti- tution labours. More permanent good maybe expected from means taken to remedy the constitutional evils, than from such violent remedies as are directed against the affected part, but which also produce a baneful

ON MORTIFICATION 60 in the internal viscera; but it not unfrequently hap- pens, that the painful sensations suddenly cease,-whilst no gangrene supervenes, and that a part mortifies, whilst the pain continues but little abated. In compound fractures, or dislocations, dark-co- loured prominent points occasionally appear, in con- sequence of the effusion of bloody serum beneath the cuticle; in these, however, the fluid is speedily absorb- ed, and the surface resumes its natural aspect; and it is of consequence to know their real nature, for if mistaken for the gangrenous phlyctenae, the inexpe- rienced practitioner may be alarmed, and, consequent- ly, have recoiu'se to very injudicious practice. When the process of gangrene is checked, the skin immediately beyond the mortified part becomes of a brighter hue, and is affected by a more healthy species of inflammation, which ultimately terminates in suppuration, and thereby forms what is called the line of demarcation between the dead and living parts; the suppurating process, commencing in the integuments, gradually extends to the deeply seated parts, so that the mortified jwrtion is ultimately attached to the living merely through the medium of bone or ligament. Arteries appear more than any other texture to resist sloughing; and those leading to a mortified part are found contracted and filled witli coagulated blood, so that the spontaneous sepa- ration of the sloughs, and even incisions for their removal, made in sound parts, are followed by little or no bleeding. This salutary change in the arteries may be accounted for by sui)posiug, that the

In order to discover the foreign body, probes will be necessary, and of these, the finger is the best, unless when the wound is of considerable depth; if, on examination, the ball cannot be discovered, and if there is reason to think it has followed an indirect course, the sur- geon will, sometimes, be assisted in his diagnosis, by placing the patient in that position in which he received the wound, and then judging of the circum- stances most likely to affect the foreign body in its course. In many cases, extraction can be accomplish- ed by means of the finger alone; in others, forceps and scoops, various in length and size, are indispen- sable. Afterwards, light dressings are to be em- ployed ; and in the first instance, cold applications may prove advantageous in subduing the inflamma- tory action; but when suppuration has commenced, warm fomentations and poultices are to be preferred, which will in many cases be both more grateful to the patient, and more beneficial in their results, when used even from the commencement. Afterwards, it will be necessary to afford sufficient support to the parts by bandaging, and to change the applications according to the particular circumstances ;â€”sooth- ing, if the wound be irritable, stimulating, if inert, and gently escharotic, if the granulations be exu- berant. In severe injuries of the limbs, the surgeon must be guided by the state of the part, and of the consti- tution, by the circumstances in which he is placed, as to accommodation, and mode of transportation, &c..

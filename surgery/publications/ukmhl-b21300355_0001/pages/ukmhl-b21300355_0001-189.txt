OF INFLAMMATION OF VEINS. 169 cases, the spontaneous cure, a radical one, may be imitated by the surgeon ; an escharotic being applied over the trunk of the vein .at a healthy point, whereby inflammation is produced in the coats of the vessel, and obliteration of its cavity accomplished : the caus- tic which will be found most convenient and effectual, is the potassa fusa. The caustic may be made into a paste with soap; or a solid piece, of the size of a split pea, is placed over the vein, and there retained for a few hours by a bandage. The vessel being oblitera- ted, the lower veins necessarily pour their contents into those deeply seated; as they freely communicate with these, they readily empty themselves of their accumulated contents, and soon regain their calibre under the employment of bandaging. When the varicose veins are numerous, as is generally the case, the potass is to be applied to the healthy point of the larger trunk in which they terminate. But the practice is not unattended with danger, for the coats of the vessel may ulcerate in consequence of the appli- cation, and violent haemorrhage ensue ; and the degree of inflammation excited may be greater than that intended, and so extend as to give rise to the most alarming constitutional disturbance. These unfa- vourable results, however, must be of rare occurrence. Success has followed the practice in innumerable in- stances. Other operations have been performed on the veins, to procure a radical cure of varix ; a ligature has been passed round the vessel, as in the operation for aneurism; and the vessel has been divided, or a portion of it dissected out, and its cut extremities

The appearance of the ^yffy coat is not peculiar to the inflammatory state ; it frequently presents itself in blood removed from the circulation during pregnancy, and in several other conditions of the system, apparently altogether un- connected with inflammatory excitement. In these circumstances, however, the contracted or cupped ap- jiearance of the coagulum is hardly ever observed. An ignorance of the above fact leads to dangerous practice, inasmuch as certain practitioners will bleed and continue to bleed for very equivocal inflamma- tory symptoms, conceiving themselves fully wai-rant- ed in so doing by the presence of the buffy coat. This coat is often not so apj^arent in the blood first drawn, as in that afterwards abstracted. In inflammation, as was formerly remarked, the blood not only flows into those vessels which were previously incajjable of receiving all its component parts, but it also escapes from the vessels, or is extra- vasated; and this may occur with or without rupture of the vessels; and to a greater or less extent, accord- ing to the violence of the action, and the texture of the part. When local inflammatory action exists to a con- siderable degree, the general circulation is more or less disturbed.

190 OF TUMOURSi ment and induration; but the tumour frequently is; roused into activity at the critical time of life, and malignant action ultimately commences. The men- strual period ought to be particularly attended to in affections of the mamma more especially, but also in all tumours, ulcers, &c.; for both during and before itj tumours become larger and more painful, the whole system appears to be excited, and all morbid actions, seem to possess increased activity. In this disease, as in the encephaloid, or soft cancer, as it has been called, the bloody masses, or sacs containing bloody fluid, are to be dreaded, and when they exist, are to be considered as very unfavourable; for if, on the removal of a carcinomatous tumour, such appearances be found, the disease will certainly return, a new tumour, of even a worse character than the preceding, will be formed, a fungus will be pro-, truded, and from this haemorrhage will occur. The lymphatic glands, both above and below the tumour, generally enlarge early in the disease, become hard, and cut like cartilage, and with a grating noise. Frequently they become converted into a dense and fibrous substance, resembling carcinoma; sometimes they are softened and broken down at several points, and contain a purulent or bloody fluid. They enlarge, coalesce, and form irregular masses, which rise more and more above the surface ; the superimposed inte- guments give way, and then occur those destructive ravages by ulceration and sloughing already described. The lymphatic vessels entering these tumours and emerging from them, feel hard and wiry, as if thick-

28 ON INFLAMMATION. blood-vessels, the nervous system is not preternatu- rally stimulated, and thereby the increased sensibility is done away with. If the vessels have had time to re- lieve themselves by effusion of part of their contents, the elfused particles are absorbed, and the swelling disappears. In short, when inflammation terminates in resolution, the part is left in the same state in which it was previous to the supervention of the at- tack. It is not an instantaneous process, but gradual in its completion. Again, it not unfrequently happens, when inflam- mation has occurred in the surface, and continued for a short period, that it spontaneously disappears, and does not again return ; the action is said to terminate in Delitescence, and of course this is always a favom- able occurrence. But if the inflammation, after ha- ving suddenly disappeared, attacks another part at a distance from that first affected, the change is termed Metastasis. If the inflammation leaves an internal viscus, and appears on the surface of the body, the circumstance is favourable ; but if it leaves the latter to attack the former, the result is highly dangerous. Treatment.—In the treatment of inflammation, with a view of procuring resolution, our attention must be first directed to the exciting cause ; it is, if possible, to be discovered, and removed. Thus, fo- reign bodies are to be extracted—fractures reduced —strictures divided—unnatural accumulations of fluid withdrawn, &c. In many cases, if the exciting cause is removed, nothing more is required, the in-

ON INFLAMMATION. 4> be observed also in the cornea lucida, which, when violently inflamed, is pervaded by numerous vessels conveying red blood, ramifying over the whole of it, and freely inosculating with each other. Some have supposed that these vessels are newly formed, in con- sequence of inflammatory action. This opinion is erroneous ; as the vessels existed in the cornea pre- viously, and are only increased in size, so as to admit a fluid which they were formerly incapable of recei- ving. The speedy, and in many cases instantaneous, appearance of red vessels, where they could not pre- viously be observed, decidedly overturns the opinion that new vessels are in such a case formed. New vessels are seldom formed, unless after a breach of structure, or in cases where morbid deposits become vascular. Thi'ohhing^ to a greater or less degree, is always felt in an inflam'ed part by the patient; and it is fre- quently so distinct, as to be readily perceived by an attentive examination. The sensation of throbbing is not produced by the action of the capillary vessels alone, but chiefly in consequence of the larger trunks in the neighbourhood sympathizing with these capil- laries, and so having their action also increased. In fact, when the inflammatory action is extensive or severe, or when the part aff'ected is of much import- ance to life, the whole circulating system is disturb- ed, and thus arises the sympathetic excitement of the constitution. The incited action of those vessels in the more im- mediate vicinity of the inflamed part, is well marked

75 OF ERYSIPELAS. In erythema, the skin only being affected, advan- tage sometimes results from the application of nitrate of silver. The pain and uneasy sensations in the part being thereby diminished or removed, and extension of the disease seeming to be arrested. Discoloration caused by such practice is of little consequence, as desquamation must follow. It is questionable how far it may be safe to apply lunar caustic to an exten- sively inflamed surface of the head and face, lest metastasis should occur. The inflammatory action in the skin is subdued by the application, whilst it may advance, in the cellular tissue, to suppuration and sloughing, if other means are not adopted; and from the hard and blackened state of the cuticle, the condi- tion of the subjacent parts is not readily perceived. The remedy is only applicable to erythema. The practice which has proved to be, I may almost say universally, successful, is to use either the lancet or the knife. In cases not very severe or extensive, the constitutional treatment already mentioned is first to be employed, and then the affected part must be freely punctured ;—the serous effusion, if any, is thereby evacuated—the overdistended vessels are relieved of a considerable portion of their contents— and the cedematous swelling, with the formation of phlyctense, is prevented. The part is afterwards to be fomented for half an hour, or an hour, with bags full of camomile flowers; the fomentation, repeated at intervals, proves highly grateful to the feelings of the patient, allays any irritation which the making of the punctures may have produced, and keeps the

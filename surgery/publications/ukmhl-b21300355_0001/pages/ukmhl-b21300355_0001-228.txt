OF TUMOURS. 208 is continuous. The investing periosteum is much thickened, and its blood-vessels are enlarged. Occa- sionally, the deficiency of the bone is not supplied by any membranous expansion, and the morbid growth protrudes, fungous. The internal structure varies much in appearance ; generally it is brovi^n and soft, in some places broken down and mixed with a dark- coloured fluid, or with purulent matter; sometimes it is much more dense, and resembles cartilage; in others, the cavity contains an ichorous fluid, mixed with small portions of more solid matter; in the advanced stage of the disease, the contents are often of the encephaloid nature, either in its homogene- ous and solid form, or softened, broken down, and mixed with blood, or with a lard-like substance. Sometimes the cancelli of the bone are not destroy- ed, but extended, forming numerous cavities of con- siderable size, in which the morbid matter is depo- sited ; in other instances, there is no appearance of cancellated structure, and the diseased mass con- tains rough osseous spiculae, some detached, some loosely connected with each other, and others project- ing from the inner surface of the bony parietes of the tumour. At the commencement of the disease, the patient feels acute pain in the part, the constitution is disturbed; afterwards, the pain becomes more dull, and there is a considerable swelling externally, which feels hard, and slightly elastic ; in the advanced stage, the pain again becomes severe, and is of a lancinating kind, and the system is much deranged, the tuhiour is softer, often presents a sense of distinct fluctuation, 1

127 AND DISEASES THENCE AIHSINCr. tion is accomplislied. The whole of the articulating extremity is also very rarely destroyed by this dis- ease. Many writers have talked of death of a bone throughout its whole extent, and in fact the term necrosis was originally adopted on this supposition. The progress of necrosis is, as has been said, simi- lar to that of sphacelation. The affected bone gradu- ally changes its colour, and loses its sensibility; a line of demarcation is formed, and ultimately the dead portion is completely detached from the living. Previous to its separation, the sui-rounding parts have commenced forming new osseous matter, which is secreted in nodules, and from continued deposition, soon becomes consolidated; the new bone next se- cretes a texture similar to itself, whereby the new deposit becomes extended, and not unfrequently affords an almost complete encasement to the dead portion or sequestrum. In general, bone dies irre- gularly, so that the sequestrum presents an uneven surface, and its margins are rough and serrated by numerous sharp projections. From this appearance of the dead bone, it was imagined that after its sepa- ration, portions of it were removed by absorption; and this opinion was strengthened by the thin exfo- liations of the external lamina being fou.nd perforated at several points by minute apertures,â€”worm-eaten, as it was called. But a dead portion of bone, detached from the surrounding parts, is in every respect an extraneous body, and is not, and cannot be, acted on by the absorbents, any more than a piece of metal, glass, wood, or stone. Some have gone so far as to

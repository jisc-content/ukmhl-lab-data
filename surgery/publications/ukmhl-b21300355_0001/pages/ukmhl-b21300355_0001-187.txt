OF INFLAMMATION OF VEINS. l67 matter, by which these phenomena are explained, has not been as yet sufficiently authenticated by such facts as warrant its confident assertion. Veins frequently become dilated or varicose; they assume a tortuous course, appear much enlarged, and present an elastic soft feel, except in the situation of the valves, where they are more hard and incom- pressible ; occasionally the tortuous windings form a bluish tumour, of considerable size, partaking of the same character as one of its component trunks. The dilatation is increased by heat. The limb is swollen and oedematous. When a dilated vein is inflamed, the pain is much increased, the vessel feels like a firm chord, its coats are much thickened, and its cavity proportionally contracted ; lymph is effused, and by it the canal may be obliterated to a greater or less extent. The disease is rarely met with in the upper extremities, lut frequently in the lower limbs, in the scrotum, labium, lower part of the abdomen, in the neighbourhood of the anus, and at the lower part of the neck. Occasionally the contained blood coagu- lates, the canal of the vessel is thereby obliterated, and a spontaneous cure accomplished. But the coats of the vessel not unfrequently ulcerate, and blood is discharged in appalling profusion : and such an oc- (^iirrence may prove rapidly fatal. In the lower limbs, the disease is often complicated with ulcers; and as long as the veins remain varicose, the ulcers are almost incurable, or if they are brought to cicatrize, the skin soon ulcerates again, and the disease is re- established.

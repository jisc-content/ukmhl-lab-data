89 THE SYNOVIAL MEMBRANES. serous in this respect, as well as in healthy structure and function. Like the serous, too, they are shut sacs, are smooth on their surface, and furnish a simi- lar secretion, that of the synovial, however, being somewhat more glairy than the serous. Neither, in their healthy state, are possessed of much sensibility, nor are ligaments, tendons, tendinous sheaths, and bursae, which two latter textures greatly resemble the synovial; when inflamed, they become most exquisitely sensible. The incited action of the blood- vessels is followed by increased discharge, which is less glairy and albuminous, partaking more of the serous character. When the incited action soon terminates, and the activity of the absorbents is diminished, the fluid accumulates within the joint, producing jEZ?/f/rop.y Articuli. This disease, however, may exist without previous incited action, the secretion being of its usual quantity, whilst the action of the absorbents is less than natural. The knee is more frequently the seat of dropsy than any other joint. When the action is more violent, lymph is effused on the inner surface of the membrane, or is deposited amongst the ligamentous and cellular tissues external to the joint, in consequence of which, the membrane and external ligaments become thickened, and of an almost cartilaginous consistence. Serum is effused into the more superficial cellular tissue, filling up the hollows around the joint, concealing the protube- rances of the bones, and producing a globular swell- ing. The articulating surfaces become ulcerated, and matter forms within the capsular ligament; or the

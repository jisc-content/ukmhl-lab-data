AFFECTIONS OF THE AIITEEIAL SYSTEM. 149 tlie coats are thickened, especially the middle, and from the thickening and increased action of the muscular fibres, the internal coat becomes somewhat rugous, the rugae being in a transverse direction. The anem-ismal tumour in general increases, and approaches the surface, involving and destroying all the intervening textures. If resisted in its enlarge- ment by bone, even this is not sufficient to impede its progress, but becomes absorbed and perhaps ulcerated at the point where it is compressed by the tumour. The osseous is more liable to destruction from this cause than the cartilaginous tissue, contrary to what occurs from compression by abscess. Ultimately the sac gives way, and its contents are discharged either externally, or into an internal cavity or canal, in conse- quence of its parietes sloughing from the compression made by the tumour; and such termination is fatal. The disease may also prove fatal by mere compression of the trachea, impeding breathing, and inducing dis- ease of the respiratory organs ; or by pressure on the gullet preventing the passage of food : in the latter .case, however, the dissolution is generally more sud- iden, in consequence of the compressing part of the itumour giving way, and the contents being evacuated into the stomach or mouth. If the aneurism compress a plexus of nerves, or the spinal chord itself, the anterior part of the vertebrae having been previously absorbed, paralysis is produced. In consequence of aneurism, the circulation of blood in the vessel is obstructed; hence the collateral branches above the tumour become enlarged, and through them

233 OF WOUNDS. by which a membranous substance, of extreme deli- cacy, is produced ; and the extent of this membrane is increased until it form an expansion, investing the : outer surface of the clot; it then becomes thickened, by addition of matter similar to itself from the re- cent vessels which ramify in it. At the same time it forms adhesions to the surrounding cellular tissue, and resembles the original tunics of the vein. After being consolidated, so as to prevent the flow of blood through that part, the coagulura, formed to arrest the haemorrhage, until a more complete barrier should be procured, is gradually absorbed. But the mem- brane long remains smooth, thin, and diaphanous, and can be thereby readily .distinguished from the original coats. This reparative process is much longer in being finished than the corresponding one in arteries; and from what has been stated, it is evident that the two actions differ in other respects than the time requisite. When a vein has been com- pletely divided, the extremities are closed by means similar to those which have been already detailed in regard to arteries. In many, nay in most, instances of haemorrhage from a wounded artery, the surgeon cannot wait for the natural processes by which the flow of blood is arrested, but must have recourse to immediate and certain means. In division of the smaller arteries, or in minute wounds of the larger, pressure, well applied, will often be sufl[icient. In both cases it immediately stops the flow: in the former, it pre- vents the blood from penetrating into that portion

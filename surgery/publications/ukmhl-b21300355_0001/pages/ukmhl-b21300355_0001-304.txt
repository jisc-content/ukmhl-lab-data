284 OF ULCEUS OF THE GENITAL ORGANS, The effects of the venereal virus are divided into primary or local, and secondary or constitutional; and these present a great variety in their appearances, characters, and tendencies. They are sometimes mo- dified by the constitution, or by the remedies ordered in the first stage; but there can be no doubt that different poisons exist, producing distinct kinds of ulcers, which again are succeeded by different consti- tutional affections. The most common kind of sore is the simple ulcer^ at first excavated, in consequence of the process of ulceration continuing ; afterwards the ulceration stops, and granulations, somewhat fungous, supply its place, so that the surface is raised above the level of the surrounding parts, and has a smooth soft appearance; there is no hardness of the edges, and there is no tendency to slough or extend by ulcer- ation. Sometimes it commences in the form of a pustule, which soon gives way, discharging its con- tents, and leaving an exposed surface, in which the process of ulceration quickly proceeds; but often it arises from simple abrasion of the surface. Dif- ferent forms of sores may exist on the glans and pre- puce at the same time ; and it is maintained, that one sore may produce another of a different kind, and the same is asserted with regard to eruptions. The simple ulcer, as well as other sores, is produced by the contact of secretions, generally morbid, but often apparently healthy, with a susceptible surface. Sores, with eruption and sore throat, sometimes appear in one or both individuals immediately after marriage,

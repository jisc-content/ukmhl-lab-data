240 OF WOUNDS. this view it is evident, that, besides a certain excite- ment of the blood-vessels, it is necessary that the raw margins be in close apposition, and carefully retained so, for, by ever so slight movement of the parts, the recent and delicate bond of union will be ruptured ; and if this motion be allowed to continue, adhesion may be at divers times begun, but can never be perfected. Whereas, if the necessary precautions are adopted, union is often completed in thirty or forty hours, sometimes sooner, seldom later; and from a knowledge of the astonishing powers of nature in re- pairing injuries, many and important additions have accrued to the science of surgery. In the majority of instances, it is also requisite that the parts be brought in contact soon after division, otherwise gra- nulation will have commenced in the different parts of the wound, and the surfaces then approximated will not so readily adhere; pus is formed, and ha- ving lodged between the surfaces, acts as an extra- neous substance, keeping them apart, and separating them still farther by its accumulation. All foreign bodies in the wound must be removed before adhe- sion can occui'; and on the same principle, care ought to be taken that no effused blood be interposed. In many cases the margins of the wound can be accu- rately adjusted by careful attention to the position of the part, or by the application of a few strips of adhesive plaster; but the latter, from indiscriminate use, often prove the source of much irritation, and totally frusiTfite the end for which they are designed. When employed, ihey ought to be narrow and few*

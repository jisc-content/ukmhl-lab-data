206 OF TUMOURS. its whole extent, or the greater part of it, and of a cancellated texture; sometimes, also, it is much thickened, and, at the same time, of great solidity; but such enlargements cannot be considered as tu- mours of bones, or exostoses, any more than those nodules of new osseous matter, which are effused in consequence of inflammation of the osseous tissue. The most frequent cause of exostoses, appears to be external injury ; their progress is slow, attended with slight dull pain, and often accompanied with no in- convenience ; their existence can be readily ascer- tained, a hard and immovable body being felt where no bone exists in the natural state of parts ; but when the tumour projects into an internal cavity, the diagnosis is rendered obscure. Being jDossessed of but little vitality, they are ill able to withstand any incited action ; and hence not unfrequently die, producing all the usual symptoms of necrosis ; such a termination is less frequent than their structure and organization would lead us to imagine. Most frequently, they remain stationary, after having at- tained a certain size, and are productive of little inconvenience, the surrounding parts having accom- modated themselves to the new formation. Occasion- ally, suppuration occurs in the soft parts, the matter comes to the surface, and a troublesome abscess is formed. To this class of tumours would I confine the term exostosis, not including those consisting of softer materials, and possessed of a less benign action.

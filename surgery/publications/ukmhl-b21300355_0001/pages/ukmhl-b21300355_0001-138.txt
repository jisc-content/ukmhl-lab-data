OF INFLAMMATION OF BONE, 118 riated and generally of a livid colour. The ichorous discharge occasionally dries up for a short period, and again breaks out more violently. The surface of the ulcer is, in some cases, occupied by soft un- healthy granulations, in others the earthy part of the bone is most prominent. Wlien the parts have been macerated and dried, the disease is often found to have proceeded more in width than in depth, and the absorption has not reduced all points of the diseased surface to the same level, thin portions remaining somewhat elevated, and giving the part a cancellated appearance; and there often project numerous minute osseous fibrillse of considerable length, which intermix with one another, and form a most delicate network. In other instances, the ulceration has extended more deeply, and a considerable cavity is formed, with irregular margins and sm'face ; and not unfrequently it contains dead portions of the cancellated structure, in some of a dark, in others of a light colom*; or it is occupied, in the recent state, by a substance resem- bhng lard. The surrounding bone is much softened, and, after maceration, becomes exceedingly light. The disease is generally confined to one or two bones, but occasionally involves a whole chain. It may be limited to a part of one bone in a joint, or may embrace the whole of it. Its extent will depend on the severity of the primary action, or on the degree and duration of the pressure which has been allowed to exist, whether from the nature of the superincumbent tex- ture or the carelessness of the sm-geon. Interstitial absorption often occurs in the tarsus

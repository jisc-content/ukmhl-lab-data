In cases of simple division, without much separation of the parts, re- union of the nerves may take place, and their func- tions be restored. If the limb remains paralysed, after cicatrisation of the wound, tepid effusions, fric- tion, either dry or with liniment, stimulating applica- tions, &c., may be advantageous. TETANUS Is a disease which occasionally follows a wound, but rarely in this country. It is a spasmodic contrac- tion, with rigidity, of the voluntary muscles, in some cases involvingthe whole body,inothers the upperpart of it only, and in some it is confined to a certain class of muscles. When the extensors are affected, the disease is termed opisthotonos; when the flexors, emprostho- tonos. Complete tetanus is said to exist when the flexor

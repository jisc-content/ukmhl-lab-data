On examining the limb, the lower portion of the femur was found somewhat enlarged, its internal structure completely destroyed, and the periosteum on the inner side much thickened. On the posterior and inner part of the bone, about three inches above its articu- lation, there was a small fungous tumour of an irre- gular surface, and of soft consistence, resembling con- gealed tallow. From this excrescence, the blood had been effused into a cyst formed amongst the muscles, and afterwards discharged externally. He recovered from the amputation, and remained well. The Painful Tiiherde, Though of small size, and not possessed of malig- nant action or disposition, is a tumour of very great interest, on account of the excruciating pain with which it is accompanied. It is mostly situated in the subcutaneous cellular tissue, but not unfrequently in the intermuscular cellular substance ; one tumour of this species which I removed, was so deep, as to be in immediate contact with the sheath of the posterior tibial nerve. The tumour, generally of the size of a garden pea, rarely exceeds that of a cherry. It is invested by a dense ligamentous cyst, to which it intimately adheres; but occasionally the capsule is thin and cellular: in many instances its surface is perfectly sjnooth, in others it is slightly nodulated.

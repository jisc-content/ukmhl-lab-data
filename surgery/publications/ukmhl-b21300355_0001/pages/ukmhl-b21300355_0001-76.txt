ON MOllTIFICATION. 56 The most common cause of spontaneous mortifica- tion is a rigid state of the arteries, most frequently- met with in the inferior extremities of elderly persons, in consequence of the deposition of calcareous matter Jbetween the internal and middle coat; this calcareous degeneration may be confined to a part of the limb, or may pervade the whole of it, and even extend throughout the arterial system. There are many cases in which disease of the arteries has existed, though no gangrene occurred ; but this by no means invalidates our assertion, since, when arteries are thus affected, the part cannot withstand sphacelus when exposed to any of its immediate causes. After wet seasons, spontaneous gangrene has prevailed as an endemial disease on the continent, where rye is a principal article of food. The rye is subject to a disease called Ergot, or Cockspu?' Rye; the grains become large, black, and have a horny consistence; and the use of it, when thus diseased, is assigned as the cause of gangrene. The patients who have suf- fered from it have experienced pain and heat, with swelling, generally in the lower limbs, though occa- sionally in the upper. These symptoms abating, the parts became cold, insensible, and discoloured, and were gradually separated from the body. The dis- ease attacked patients of both sexes and every age, did not appear to be infectious, and was frequently fatal. It has occurred in this country from the use of unsound wheat. A tendency to mortification some- times arises from a i)eculiar state of the atmosphere, want of cleanliness, poor and irregular diet, &c. Can-

After its appli- cation, poultice for a few days, and then stimulate both internally and externally, according to circumstances, the parts being all along well supported. The con- tinued use of warm fomentations, or poultices, is prejudicial, as tending to diminish still farther the action of the parts; ointments, also, will generally do harm. >r III.

Their mar- gins are thick and insensible—their surfaces smooth, hollow, and of a pale colour—the discharge is scanty, and adheres to the surface. A sore, having been long open and neglected, degenerates into this state. Poul- tices are to be applied for a day or two, to clean the surface, promote the discharge, and soften the callous margins. This is the more necessary, if, as is often the case, the sore, or the surrounding integuments, are inflamed when the patient applies for relief. Afterwards the applications must be stimulant. In such cases only is adhesive strap applicable, and in them it produces the most beneficial results.

Some tow is placed on the plasters, and the bandage

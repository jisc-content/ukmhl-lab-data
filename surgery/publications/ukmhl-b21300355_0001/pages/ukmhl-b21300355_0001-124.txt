104 OF COXALGIA, MORBUS COXAllIUS, ulceration proceeds farther, and an aperture is formed in the acetabulum, into which the femur is lodged, and matter consequently accumulates within the pelvis, beneath the iliacus muscle. When matter has formed in the soft parts round the joint, portions of the bones of the pelvis, in contact with the pus, are ulcerated to a greater or less extent, and sometimes these ulcers are surrounded by deposits of new bony matter. From such changes in the osseous parts of the articulation, the limb is shortened, sometimes to a great degree, though no dislocation has occurred. Indeed, dislocation is by no means so frequent a cause of the shortening as is generally believed. If the head of the femur has been dislocated, and if the disease in the joint has afterwards subsided, the acetabulum is found to be much contracted, with its margins smooth and little elevated, and if the patient survive for a number of years, it will be almost wholly obliterated. But a portion of the dorsum of the ilium, upward and backward, which is the most frequent dislocation in this disease, is gradually ab- sorbed, so as to form a cavity for the reception of the femur, the extremity of which becomes more solid in texture, and more smooth in its articular surface. Whilst a depression is thus formed, new bone is de- posited round its margins, whereby the cavity is increased in depth, and resembles the original aceta- bulum, the new deposit having become smooth and of a regular form. The osseous matter in this situation is often secreted in too great abundance, so that the margin is much elevated> and confines the extremity

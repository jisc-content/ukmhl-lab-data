27 ON INFLAMMATION. intensity; and not vinfrequently several of the termi- nations occur combined with each other. Adhesion has also been mentioned as a termination of inflammation, but perhaps improperly; for, al- though, in certain parts of the body, as in the serous cavities, adhesion is produced in consequence of in- flammatory action, and during its progress, still the process of adhesion is altogether independent of this action in other textures, such as the cellular. In the uniting of a flesh wound, a certain degree of incited action of the blood-vessels is necessary for the accom- plishment of the adhesive process ; but should that incited action rise to inflammation, the union by the first intension is interrupted, and the wound must heal by suppuration and granulation. Adhesion will be more properly attended to when treating of wounds. The various terminations of inflammation are sa- lutary or destructive, according to circumstances ; but resolution is, in general, the one most to be desired; although, after the inflammatory action has attained a certain point, this cannot be expected to occur. . Resolution takes place when, in consequence of the increased action in the larger arterial trunks being diminished, the affected capillaries receive a smaller supply of blood, and transmit it more easily into the corresponding veins ; and when they are thereby less •dilated, and consequently enabled to resume their contractile power. The circulation in the part becomes again natural, and the circulating fluid also resumes its healthy properties, the redness and sensation of •throbbing are gone. From the non-dilatation of the

OF INFLAMMATION OF 96 points: or, in consequence of the effusion of lymph into, and the consequent thickening and induration of, the ligamentous substance exterior to the joint, this connecting medium is so strengthened and concen- trated as to retain the articulating surfaces in exact apposition; from one, and usually from both, of the-se changes, the joint is securely fixed and rendered immovable. But after this, the disease is still apt to recur from slight causes, the bony or ligamentous union being disturbed or destroyed, and the original disease attacking the parts with fresh activity; abscesses form, may be extensive both in size and number, and thereby the health is again imdermined. So that the patient, after undergoing much suffering and risk, preserves, for a few years, a limb which is almost useless to him, only that it may be removed. In other cases, the union is permanent, the disease does not return, and, by care and time, the limb is brought into the most convenient position, and proves of considerable service. The appearances produced by inflammation, and disease of the synovial membrane, are the following. In the first stage, the internal surface of the capsular ligament, and the rest of the synovial membrane, is found of a red hue, its formerly colourless vessels being now made apparent, from enlargement and consequent injection with red blood; and the serum within the cavity of the joint is greater in quantity than in the natural state. "When the disease has been of longer continuance, the membrane is found considerably thickened, its usual smooth glossy sur- 8

64 ON MORTIFICATION. by which the dead i)arts still adhere to the living ; or he may perform amputation immediately below the line of demarcation. Amputation in the sound parts cannot be recommended : for vitality is impaired throughout the system, and more particularly near and above the line of demarcation, where, though the structure seems entire, yet the incisions are made in parts really diseased, and which will speedily mortify. In fact, amputation, in whatever way performed, is almost always productive of no advantage in sponta- neous gangrene. In order to prevent the occurrence of gangrene after exposure to intense cold, the frigid part must be cautiously and slowly restored to its natural temperature ; first, by being either placed in very cold water, or rubbed with snow ; afterwards by the degree of warmth in the applications, and sm'roundiug at- mosphere, being gradvially increased. In acute gangrene, and in robust constitutions, when the affection arises from overaction, abstrac- tion of blood is had recourse to with marked advan- tage. In some cases it may be employed, but with due caution, even after sphacelus has occurred. In gangrene, purging, bleeding, and starving must not be had recourse to but with the greatest circum- spection ; for it ought always to be remembered, that however strongly they may be indicated, the time is not far distant when they will be totally inadmis- sible, and when the weakening effects of depletion will prove highly prejudicial, particularly in cases where the mischief is proceeding rapidly. 4

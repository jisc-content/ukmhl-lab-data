The sores following the use of the moxa are in some in- stances tedious in healing; and this may be ascribed to the vitality of the surrounding parts having been diminished by the application. • When caries is established, and the integuments have given way, the best and most successful pro- ceeding is that pointed out by natui'e—destruction of the diseased portion; and the means must vary according to the particular circumstances. In many cases, nature seems to wait but for the separation of the sickly parts, either by accident, or by the inter- ference of art.

The first indication will be accomplished by trephines, scoops, saws, forceps, &c.; the second by the cautery; frequently both are required. In caries of the long bones, it is in general necessary to enlarge the opening through the outer lamella by the trephine; and if the disease be exten- sive, different perforations thus made may be con-

OF WOUNDS. 234 of the sheath which has been vacated by the retracted artery ; and it being thereby confined, and kept in a state of rest, coagulation soon takes place. At the same time, the compression brings the divided margins of the vessel into close apposition, and thereby per- manent closure, by adhesion, is quickly accomplished. In the latter, the mere circumstance of the escape of blood being prevented, naturally hastens the closure of the minute aperture by the natural process ; and if the compression be severe, the opposite surfaces of the vessel, being brought in contact, may adhere, and the canal be obliterated at the wounded point. It is obvious, that in this latter class, pressure can only be of advantage immediately after the infliction of the wound, and not when blood is extravasated to a great extent. Pressure may be used along with styjDtics, or along with escharotics, actual or potential. They may be often employed when pressure ought not; styptics promote the contraction and retraction of the divided extremities, and thereby expedite the formation of a coagulum. Escharotics form an eschar, which, ad- hering to the extremity of the vessel, stops the flow of blood, and the cut margins of the vessel, being stimulated by the application, soon cohere. Not unfrequently after the separation of the slough, union has not taken place, and the haemorrhage is renewed ; and, from this circumstance, the remedy cannot be trusted to except when the divided vessels or vessel are of small size. It may be stated, generally, that these means are of little avail without methodical

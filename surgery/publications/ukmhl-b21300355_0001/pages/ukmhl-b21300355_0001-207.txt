187 OF TUMOUES: ' By these circumstances, it can in general be readil)?*, distinguished from the tumours which, from the first* occupy a wide space, and are firmly fixed by intimate connexions with the surrounding parts. When the tumour has once been developed, its progress is slow and steady, being arrested, or made to recede, neither by the eiForts of nature, nor by the interference of art. Pain is generally complained of in the region 6f the tumour, and is of a lancinating kind, compared by the patient to the passing of sharp instruments through the part; occasionally there is no pain in the new formation, and little inconvenience is caused by it. When the disease is left to itself, ulceration occurs, frequently at an early period ; but sometimes only after the tumour has been of long duration. The superimposed integuments appear stretched, change their natural colour, assume a dusky or livid hue, become attenuated, and ultimately give way; the breach of surface not being caused by tension and pressure, but by the parts having assumed an action similar to that of the tumour. The ulcerated point slowly enlarges, a thin ichorous fluid is discharged, the surrounding integuments are of a dusky red, and the margins of the ulcer are thickened, callous, evert- ed. Whilst the destructive action proceeds in a late- ral direction, it at the same time advances towards the more deeply-seated parts, the cavity becomes excavated, irregular, and ragged ; and the parts seem to be destroyed partly by ulceration and partly by sloughing. The exposed surface seldom aims at re- paration; and when it does, the granulations are

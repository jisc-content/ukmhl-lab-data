Sometimes union does occur, and that speedily, after the flap has remained separate for a considerable time; and in such cases it may be doubted, whether union is accomplished by adhesion, strictly so called, or by granulation. Most probably it is by the former of these processes that the rapid union occurs in such circumstances; the divided parts have assumed an excited action, and effused lymph ; and during their state of separation, the lymph will become organized when it is connected with the original partSj just as well as if the surfaces had been in contact; and when they are at length so placed, they will be agglutina- ted to each other by the outer part of the effused lymph, which still continues soft and unorganized. If motion be then prevented, organization, which has already commenced in the connecting medium, will proceed undisturbed,converting the agglutination of soft inorganized lymph into firm and permanent union by means of organized tissue. In these cir- cumstances, it is not to be wondered at, if adhesion should be completed in a shorter time than when the surfaces are brought together immediately after their division ; in each instance the process is the same, only in the one it has to proceed from its very com- mencement, whilst in the other it is previously all but perfected, and after the parts have been put together, the last stage only requires completion. If, however, the parts remain separate until the effu-

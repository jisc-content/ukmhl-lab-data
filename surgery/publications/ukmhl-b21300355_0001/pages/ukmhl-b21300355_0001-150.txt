OF INFLAMMATION OF BONE, 130 and this species of necrosis occurs most frequently in the flat bones. In necrosis involving a greater thickness of the bone, the new matter is also fui*- nished by the subjacent parts, which, however, are materially assisted in the process by the extremities of the living bone, which form the margins of the deficiency. The bony matter is deposited with great activity, and frequently columns of the new deposit cross over the sequestrum, binding it firmly down, and rendering it almost immovable, although it is completely detached from the living parts. It has already been stated, that those vessels which ramify within the substance of the Periosteum have no share in the reproduction of bone, but osseous matter is effused by the ramifications extending from the membrane to the bone; this effusion becomes organized, and greatly assists in forming the substi- tute. In internal inflammation and necrosis, the symp- toms are all of a more violent character; and the painful feelings, the discharge, and the thickening of the bone, continue, as long as the cancellated seques- trum remains. It is remarkable how a limited, and, on after examination, an apparently trifling necrosis of the cancellated structure may produce the most violent local symptoms, induce severe symptomatic fever, endanger the life of the patient, and render removal of the limb absolutely necessary. Occasionally abscesses form at a considerable dis- tance from the necrosed part, and afterwards degene-

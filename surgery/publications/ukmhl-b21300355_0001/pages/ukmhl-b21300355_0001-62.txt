ON SUPPUEATION. 42 merous small apertures, exposing the gland denuded and prominent in the middle of the chasm; in such cases, the gland proves the source of much irritation, and must be destroyed, otherwise the cure is ex- tremely tedious. Collections of pus in glands or cellular substance, in patients of a weak constitution, either naturally or in consequence of disease, are attended with little or no pain, or inflammatory action ; and although it is probable that inflammation does precede the forma- tion of such purulent depots, still it is generally so slight as not to be observed by the patient or his attendant. The sensation is dull and uneasy, rather than painful; and, even after the accumulation of a considerable quantity of purulent matter, redness of the surface and pointing do not occur till a late pe- riod. The contained matter is thin, flaky, and of a brownish colour. The collections often attain a very great size, and, if improperly treated, terminate in the formation of numerous and extensive sinuses. The skin, particularly that of the face, becomes, in very many cases, affected either primarily or second- arily with scrophulous ulceration, which commonly extends to the neighbouring textui'es. The disease has been mistaken for cancer, and other affections of a maliernant nature, and has received various names accordingly. The integuments in the neighbourhood of the ulcer are of a purple hue, and become under- mined, from the extension of the disease in the subja- cent cellular tissue. The discharge is thin and gleety â€”the sore is of an unhealthy and debilitated charac-

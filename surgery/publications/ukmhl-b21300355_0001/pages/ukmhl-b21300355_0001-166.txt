146 OF INFLAMMATION, AND OTHER blood consequent on the giving way of the internal coat, and situated externally to the canal of the artery. It is true, that dilatation may occur previously to the giving way of the coats, and thus the two causes are combined, but the former is one of little efficacy and importance when compared with the latter. The dila- tation occurs from the calibre of the artery being con- siderably constricted at the point where its coats have undergone the calcareous degeneration, and only acts as a predisposing cause to the failure of the coats when thus diseased. When there is mere dilatation, the tumour is generally of an oval form, but when the internal coat gives way, a lateral prominence is formed, and gradually increases in- size. The shape of the true aneurism is various; sometimes the tumour is globular, with a narrow neck, and from the neck being of considerable length, it becomes difficult to ascertain the particular artery which is the seat of disease, the globular extremity of the tumour present- ing itself at a distance from the vessel with which its pedicle is connected ; at other times its form is very irregular, being most prominent at the part where the accumulation of the blood is least resisted. Pulsation in the tumour is distinct from the first, and is painful to the patient; and in the external aneurisms, it is so strong as to be perceived by a bystander at a con- siderable distance. The tumour is at first compressible, . and completely disappears on pressure being applied, either directly to the sac, or to the artery above, the sac being thereby emptied of its contents. It may be difficult to form an accurate diagnosis, from the cir-

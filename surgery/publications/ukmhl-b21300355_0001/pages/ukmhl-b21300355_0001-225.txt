205 OF TUMOURS. impeding the motions of the muscles, or disturbing the functions of any adjoining organ. They possess no malignant disposition, but are under the same laws, though perhaps in a less degree, with their parent trunk. On making sections of exostoses, and of the bones from which they arise, some appear to be mere en- largements or processes of the parent bone, the can- cellated tissue extending itself so as to form the inte- rior of the exostoses, whilst the exterior resembles a proportionate extension of the outer lamina. Others are evidently formed by the deposition of osseous matter externally to the outer lamina, many being dense and compact throughout, others containing an internal cancellated structure, but which is not con- tinuous with that of the bone, as it is separated by the natural outer lamina. Their formation appears to be similar to that of the foetal bones : a glutinous matter is effused, becomes dense, and is converted into cartilage ; blood-vessels shoot into it, ramify throughout its whole structure in a radiated form, and deposit osseous matter. This deposit increases, and extends from a central nucleus towards the cir- cumference, the cartilage is absorbed, and the new structure becomes osseous, and similar to the original tissue by the vessels of which it was formed. The former are of the most rapid growth, and attain the largest size; the latter are of an indolent character, and are covered externally by thickened periosteum, to which they intimately adhere. Frequently a bone is much enlarged throughout

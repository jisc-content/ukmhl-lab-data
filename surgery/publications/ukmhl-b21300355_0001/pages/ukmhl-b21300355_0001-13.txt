PREFACE. The rapid advancement made in the Patho- logy and Treatment of Surgical Diseases de- mands a perpetual revision and correction of the systematic works devoted to this depart- ment of the healing art. Accordingly, Text Books, various in merit and extent, have emanated from the different Schools. Several of these have, by successive editions, kept pace with the Science; whilst others have fallen into disuse. In this part of Britain, the Systems of Latta, B. Bell, and Allan, occupied the field ; but it being now vacant, I venture to supply the deficiency, by reducing the heads of my Lec- tures into a Compendium, or Guide, for those Students who resort to this city.

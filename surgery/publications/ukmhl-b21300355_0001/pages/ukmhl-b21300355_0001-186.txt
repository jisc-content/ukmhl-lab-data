166 OF INFLAMMATION OF VEINS. tened. The limb must be altogether disused, and the patient kept in a state of complete rest, and not exposed to any excitement or anxiety. Blisters have been employed, but with no good effect. If the vein is much distended, and it is evident it contains a confined accumulation of pus, it ought to be treated as a common abscess, the matter evacuated by an incision, and various dressings employed, according to circumstances. Such has been my practice. I have found it successful, and not followed by any untoward symptoms. The abscess is limited at each extremity by the deposition of lymph in the canal of the vessel, and after the evacuation of its contents, the cavity contracts, throws out granulations, cicatrizes, and renders the portion of the vessel which has been the seat of suppuration completely impervious; it is, in fact, altogether obliterated. Inflammation of a vein is occasionally followed by the sudden appearance of a purulent depot in some part of the body, external or internal, at a distance from the inflamed part. Thus, in inflammation of a vein in the fore-arm, it is not unusual to find an abscess formed suddenly in the axilla on the oppo- site side; and when a vein of the leg has become inflamed, after amputation, the patient is often sud- denly affected with violent symptoms of disease in the chest, and, on examination, an abscess will pro- bably be discovered in the substance of the lungs, the existence of which had been indicated only during a short time previous to death. The theory of ab- sorption and subsequent deposition of the purulent

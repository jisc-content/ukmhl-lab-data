AND DISEASES THENCE ARISING. 123 nected by a small saw, or the cutting forceps. The diseased caiicelli, thus exposed, can be readily removed by the scoop or graver. If, with the probe, it is ascer- tained that a portion of the cancellated texture has become dead and loose, it is to be removed after dila- tation of the external opening. It may frequently be difficult to distinguish, in the effused blood, between what is diseased and what is not; in which circum- stances, it will pften be prudent to cauterize freely the exposed surface, and for this purpose the oxidum hydi'argyri rubrum ought generally to be preferred. The slough will soon be thrown off, and healthy granulations fill up the breach. The application of the actual cautery may be found necessary; at one time I employed this remedy very extensively in' caries, and often with most marked success; I have since, however, been led to change my opinion, and am now inclined to prefer the potential cautery already mentioned. By the application of the red-hot iron, the diseased portion is destroyed effectually, but at the same time the vitality of the surrounding parts is often very much diminished, so that theyare incapable of assuming a sufficient degree of action for throwing off the dead part; and their action being increased whilst their power is diminished, they may become affected with caries, and thus, instead of being arrest- ed, the original disease will either be increased, or extensive necrosis may take place. The red oxide of mercury is not calculated to produce such bad effects, and is sufficiently powerful for complete de- struction of the diseased parts. It will be necessary

AND THEIR CONSEQUENCES. 293 old skin in the sore assumes an excited action as in ordinary cases, and from it the requisite new texture is formed, and gradually extends over the surface, until it meet with a similar substance, which has been produced by the surrounding skin after the ulceration in that quarter ceased. Thus the general principle, that skin is formed by skin, is even in such instances found to be correct, the healing from the centre not being caused, as some have supposed, by the former skin being at that part completely destroyed, but from its having remained unaffected, or nearly so. . The appearance of the eruption is preceded by general indisposition, and occasionally by smart fever. It is sometimes extensive, but is in general confined to the upper parts of the body. Ulcers of the throat occur of a very alarming kind, quickly destroying the parts attacked, spreading chiefly towards the posterior part of the fauces, rapidly extending to the pharynx and to the nostrils, and in some instances also involving the larynx.

35 ON SUPPURATION. ded by shivering, recurring at intervals, and com- monly terminating in profuse perspiration. But this is by no means an unequivocal sign of the occui-rence of suppuration. The older authors supposed that pus was derived from the solids—or that it was formed by the melting of dead animal matter—or that it was the result of putrefaction; in accordance with which latter opi- nion, the term pus was given to the fluid; but such opinions have long since been justly exploded. Pus is separated from the blood by the secreting power of the blood-vessels of the inflamed part, in conse- quence of their having assumed a new mode of action. The secretion from exposed surfaces is not at first purulent, but is transparent—does not contain globules—and is somewhat of a gelatinous aj)pear- ance; and it is only after it has been exposed to the atmosphere for some time that the fluid contains glo- bules, and becomes true purulent matter. But pus is often formed where the secreting surface could not have been exposed to the air; for, on opening an abscess, the parietes of which had been previously entire and not much attenuated, piu'ulent matter of the usual properties is copiously discharged. The formation of the globules also seems to be independ- ent of any vital action ; for if the fluid, immediately after its secretion, be removed from the sore, and kept in a similar temperature with that of the infla- med surface, and be at the same time freely exposed to the air, globules will appear in as short a period as when the secretion is allowed to remain in contact

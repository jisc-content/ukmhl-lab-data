120 OF INFLAMMATION OF BONE, that incited action occurs to a very considerable degree; and the diseased parts, already extremely weak, have not sufficient power to withstand the action, but die ; whilst the action of the surrounding parts, not being increased to such a degree as to overcome their powers, throws off the dead, secretes a more bland discharge, and deposits healthy granulations to gradually fill up the cavity. Treatment.â€”In inflammation of bone, resolution must be accomplished, if possible; the other termi- nations are to be deprecated, since they frequently endanger the limb, and even the life, of the patient, and, at best, never admit of a speedy cure. To pro- mote resolution, blood must be drawn copiously from the part; and general bleeding may also be required, though in some constitutions it cannot be safely carried to any great extent. After local bleeding, fomenta- tions assiduously applied will tend much to relieve the sufferings of the patient. Purgatives, nauseating doses of antimony, and all safe measiu'es likely to subdue the vascular action, must at the same time be adopted. Free incisions sometimes relieve the pain, and cut short the disease, the distended vessels being thereby emptied; but such practice is only a last resource, when the action has resisted all other means, and threatens an unfavourable termination. If, notwith- standing the resolutive means employed, the inflam- mation proceeds unabated, and suppuration occurs, the effused pus ought never to be allowed to remain on the surface of the bone, but must be evacuated by early incision. Otherwise, the pressure of the extra-

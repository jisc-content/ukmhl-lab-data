49 ON SUrPURATION. This seldom occurs singly; on the contrary, several of them unite, and evacuate their contents by one opening. Previously to treating a sinus, its extent must be carefully examined by the probe ; which requires considerable caution, for the full extent of the canal may not be discovered, in consequence of its tortuous course, or from its diverging into collateral branches ; or the probe, by being used too forcibly, may pass into parts altogether unconnected with the morbid cavity; thus, in exploring a sinus at the lower part of the leg, or in the foot, the probe may be pushed to a considerable extent beneath the tendinous sheaths of the muscles, and induce the sur- geon to adopt treatment unnecessarily severe. Such mistakes have actually occurred; and amputation has been performed at the middle of the leg, whilst a considerable portion of the foot might have been saved. In the treatment, we may at first employ, setons, injections, and graduated pressure, as formerly explained ; and if these fail, the canal must be freely laid open by the knife,â€”a mode of practice much more effectual; then there is formed a cavity simi- lar to that of a common abscess, and to be treated accordingly. Incision is most frequently necessary when the sinus exists in adipose substance, in tendi- nous structure, in parts possessed of little vitality, and in patients of a sluggish and enfeebled constitu- tion. In sinus, as well as in abscess, the potass is of essential service ; a stick of it may be introduced into: the canal, and if the sinus is superficial, the integu- ments may be divided by this caustic as effectually D

152 OF INFLAMMATION, AND OTHEU but in the majority the operation proved wholly abor- tive, and not unfrequently fatal. It was necessa- rily tedious in its performance, and attended with much danger, the blood being discharged in great profusion immediately after the opening of the sac, and the extremities of the vessels being with great difficulty detected and secured. Besides, the vessels in the immediate neighbourhood of the tumour have imdergone the degeneration already mentioned, have become incapable of taking on any healthy action, and consequently the application of ligature on a vessel thus circumstanced could be productive of no advantage. From this method having almost inva^ riably proved unsuccessful, practitioners in those days generally preferred amputation, when the tumour was so situated as to allow it; and when the disease occupied a situation in the limb so high as to prevent amputation, the case was deemed incurable, and the patient abandoned to his fate. But amputation was accompanied with circumstances almost equally alarm- ing with those attendant on division of the sac : the haemorrhage was very great, for in consequence of obstruction to the free passage of the blood in the aneurismal vessel, the circulation was chiefly carried on by the collateral anastomosing branches, which were thereby so much enlarged, as, on their division, to pour out blood with a profusion resembling that of arteries of the second or third magnitude. Con- tinued pressure was employed, but was equally ineffi- cacious ; and was also attended with danger, from the risk of sloughing. If the practice ever proved

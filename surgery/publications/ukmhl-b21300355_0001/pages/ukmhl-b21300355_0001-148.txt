128 OF INFLAMMATION OF BONE, affirm that portions of these are absorbed ; but this is altogether absurd. Lead bullets remain for years in the human body, and frequently vary their situation, yet they are afterwards found to be unchanged ; portions of glass become surrounded with a dense cyst, and often remain in the body for a long time ; I extracted a large splinter of wood from the orbit in which it had been imbedded for many months, and had not changed its appearance; and numerous other examples of the non-absorption of foreign bodies might be produced, were it not that the opinion is now almost universally exploded. The separation of the dead part from the living is accomplished with greater or less ease, according to the bone which is affected, the state of the constitution, and the general health. In the bones of the superior extremity, this as well as every other action, proceeds more rapidly than in those of the inferior. It occurs in consequence of absorption of the osseous matter interposed betwixt the dead and living parts; the sequestrum is not pushed off, as some have supposed, by granulations deposited on the living margin of the bone. During its progress, matter forms, makes its way to the surface, and is discharged through minute, and often numerous, apertures, which afterwards become fistu- lous. The soft parts are thickened and indurated, and the integuments are red, and sometimes of a livid colour. Formation of matter is also occasionally the cause of necrosis ; for example,â€”I have seen several instancss in which it occurred from neglected erysi-

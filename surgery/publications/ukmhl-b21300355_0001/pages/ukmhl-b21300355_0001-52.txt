ON SUPPURATION. 32 the appearance of a depot of purulent matter is often the first indication that such action has existed; but in the majority of instances, the deposition of pus is preceded by the usual characters of well-marked in- flammatory action. Suppuration occasionally occurs without previous solution 'of continuity; for pus is frequently contained in the serous and mucous cavi- ties, when no breach of continuity can be discovered, at least we find a fluid not distinguishable from pu- rulent matter ; it may be a vitiated secretion, but still it presents the usual characters of pus. But it occurs, generally, when there has been a previous Isesion of structure, and in this case its progress is most dis- tinctly marked. In exposed cellular texture, for example, particles of blood are effused; the serum is i afterwards absorbed, and the lymph remains; this latter gives transmission to minute vessels which deposit the purulent matter, whilst others secrete particles of organised matter to form granulations, in order to repair the loss of substance. This process is often unattended with any great degree of con- stitutional disturbance. After purulent matter has begun to accumulate under the surface, the pressure therebyoccasioned jiroduces condensation of the neigh- bouring cellular tissue, which, along with the previ- ously efTused lymph, forms the parietes of the abscess; and in proportion as the matter accumulates, the ca- vity enlarges by the successive processes of ulceration of portions of its parietes, by contiinied effusion of lymph, and by farther condensation of the surround- ing parts.

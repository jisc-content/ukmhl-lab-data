ON MORTIFICATION. 61 inflammatory action which separates the dead sub- stance from the living, affects the arteries at that point as well as the other structures, causing adhesion of their internal surface, and obliteration of their cavities; ^md the natural result is, that the calibre of the artery iibove the obliterated point gradually diminishes in size, and the blood coagulates up to the nearest collateral branch : but in consequence of extension of the inflammatory action, the collateral branches may also be obliterated to a considerable extent upwards, and thus the contraction and coagulation in the larger trunk will also extend in proportion. Besides, be- fore the line of separation has commenced, arteries cannot transmit their contents into the sphacelated part, any more than into an extraneous body ; so that the circulation of the blood in them is as effectually obstructed as if a ligature were tightly applied ; in this way also, the contraction and coagulation may be accounted for. In humid gangrene, swelling with erethismus gene- rally precedes the death of the parts ; whereas in the dry, whether with change of colour or not, they shrink immediately. In the former, they quickly lose their vitality, and consequently retain a consider- able portion of their fluids ; in the latter, the process is much slower, and they become dry and shrivelled. Mortification is accompanied with great anxiety ; coldness and clamminess of the face and extremities ; weak, irregular, and hurried circulation ; quick, short breathing; a cadaverous expression of countenance ; hiccough, which, however, often occurs in very slight

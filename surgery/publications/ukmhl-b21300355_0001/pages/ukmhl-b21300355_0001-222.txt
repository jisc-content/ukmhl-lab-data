202 OF TUMOURS. reason, also, the contents of a tumour will differ in the different stages of its progress. Some contain a thin foetid brown fluid, mixed with solid particles, resembling half-dissolved fibrinous matter ; in some the contents are serous, or sero-purulent,â€”in others they are gelatinous ; whilst in those which have become inflamed from external irritation, the contents are altogether purulent, or contain a very considerable proportion of that fluid; not unfrequently the cyst is covered internally by a layer of calcareous matter, to which similar particles are loosely attached. Some- times, in consequence of irritation, the contents be- come organized, are condensed by the effusion of solid matter from the newly-formed vessels, adhere firmly to the inner surface of the cyst, and are often disposed in concentric laminae. Not unfrequently the most prominent parts of the tumour ulcerate, and on the exposed surface is depo- sited a substance of semifluid consistence and gelati- nous appearance, which afterwards increases in den- sity, and ultimately assumes all the characters of horn. This hard excrescence in some instances in- creases only to a slight degree, and afterwards remains stationary; in others it attains a large size, both as to length and breadth, and occasionally assumes a curved or tortuous forrh, like that of the horns of inferior animals. Horns are generally met with on the forehead, and the scalp may be said to be their seat. Tlie largest which I have seen measured seven inches in length, and two in circumference; but others have been removed still larger.

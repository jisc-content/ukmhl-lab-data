In conse- quence of smart haemorrhage, also, it may be neces- sary to stuff the wound with lint, and retain it for an hour or two ; but in general, the practice of stuffing abscesses is hurtful. After the incision, it is unneces- sary and injurious to discharge the pus forcibly by squeezing the sides of the abscess ; the application of a poultice will promote the evacuation of the matter, and allay the irritation. In chronic abscesses of large size, it is sometimes necessary to make a counter- opening,â€”that is, an opening in a part of the tumour opposite to the original opening, in order that the matter may be more completely discharged. Setons are highly injurious in phlegmonous abscesses, being productive of much irritation in parts which are al- ready in a morbid state of excitement; but in chronic collections, which show no disposition to heal, their use will be followed with good effects, on the same principle that they were hurtful in the preceding case; and if they should not cause a sufficient de- gree of excitement, they may be smeared with some stimulating unguent. In extensive collections, in which the matter is not sufficiently evacuated by the external aperture, injections are often useful ; in those which are comparatively recent, and in which the surrounding parts are still in a state of over- excitement, the injected fluid must be of a bland na- ture ; whilst chronic and indolent depots are to be treated by stimulant or irritating injections, for the same reason that the setoq is employed.

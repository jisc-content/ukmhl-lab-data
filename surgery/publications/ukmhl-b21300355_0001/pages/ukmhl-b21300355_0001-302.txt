28i2 OF MALIGNANT PUSTUI-E, nates futally in twenty-four hours or less ; but gene- rally the patient's sufferings are more protracted. In the treatment, superficial scarifications are of little avail. The only topical application which can be relied on, is a powerful escharotic, applied freely to the part, and at an early stage, before swelling and constitutional affection have been added. By it the parts replete with virus, being immediately deprived of vitality, are soon thrown off. Thus the virulence of the poison is annihilated, it is rendered inert, and is concentrated in the slough, and the surrounding parts are stimulated, and receive vigour of action, which enables them to resist any further inroad, and to detach quickly the mortified substance. For this purpose the most effectual and convenient escharotic is the caustic potass, but the liquid muriate of am- monia may also be emjiloyed. The vesicle is opened, and the caustic applied to the exposed surface ; and if necessary, the eschar may be afterwards divided, and the remedy reapplied. In the absence of other esclia- rotics, the actual cautery will prove a valuable sub- stitute. After the separation of the slough, the sore is to be dressed with slightly stimulating applications; Bark, camphor, and mineral acids, ai'e given inter- nally, and the patient is enjoined a light diet, with a moderate allowance of wine.

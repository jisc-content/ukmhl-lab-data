AND THEIR CONSEQUENCES. 295 The hardness or thickening is very circumscribed, not diflfusing itself gradually and imperceptibly into the surrounding parts, but terminating rather abruptly." Such is the appearance generally presented by the sore when situated on the glans and prepuce; it ge- nerally commences in the form of a pimple, without much surrounding inflammation. Sometimes the ulcerated surface is very inconsiderable, but there is always the abrupt and remarkably dense thickness which serves as a distinguishing mark. The non- syphilitic ulcers may have surrounding hardness from the first, or in consequence of the application of stimulants and escharotics, but this is diffused into the neighbourhood, and is not of that remark- able solidity peculiar to chancre. It is seldom that more than one chancre occurs; the usual situation is on the glans and lining of the prepuce; but they occasionally form on the outer surface of the prepuce, and on the dorsum penis. In the latter situation, the sore assumes a somewhat different appearance; it is in general larger, the hardness of the base is not so great, the excavation is less, and the surface is of a livid hue ; when allowed to proceed uninterrupted, the livid surface is alternated with that of a light brown or tawny colour. Chancre is an indolent ulcer when compared with the phagedenic or sloughing, the ulceration proceeds very slowly, and in propor- tion as it advances, the surrounding hardness increases. Phymosis occasionally takes place in consequence of chancre situated at the orifice of the prepuce, but not so frequently as when that situation is occupied by

ON INFLAMMATION. 7 less degree, attends inflammatory action; and perhaps it is fortunate that it does so. Because, were it not for the occurrence of pain, the patient's attention would not be directed to the disease ; he would use the part as if in health, and the affection would be much aggravated. Whereas, according to the existing pro- vision of nature, pain is felt at the commencement of the action, the presence of which the patient is there- by made aware of, and compelled to employ such measures for its removal as reason naturally dictates, of which none is more effectual than disusing the affected part. , The nerves are thus the safeguards of the various parts of the body in healthâ€”their nurses in disease. A part dejDrived of sensation may be used, even to the destruction of its texture, without producing any im- pression on the sensorium, and consequently without the animal being conscious of it. The presence of pain, as a symptom of inflamma- tion, may be easily explained. The connexion of the vascular with the nervous system is very constant and intimate. Their ramifications accompany each other, and are contained in the same cellular sheath ; and without the reciprocal influence of each, neither could perform its functions perfectly. By inject- ing a limb soon after its separation from an animal, and before its vital heat has departed, spasms of the whole muscles are produced; showing the intimate connexion between these two systems. This, how- ever, is distinct from the contractions of the muscu- lar fibre produced by the application of stimuli. In

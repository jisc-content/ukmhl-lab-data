239 Ol" WOUNDS. proceed from the different tissues, of which the mar- gins of the recent wound are composed; so, in various parts of the new formation, these vessels assume peculiar modes of action, one set forming muscles, another cellular tissue, a third skin, &c., formations corresponding to the primary tissues from which the secreting vessels proceed. Thus the vasa vasorum, ramifying on the divided ends of the minute vessels, secrete a substance which is transformed into a set of minute capillaries, and these also, assuming a secretive action, produce an arterial, or venous tube, similar to that nourished by the original vasa vasorum; by this process, the lymph becomes well supplied with blood-vessels, those from the opposite surfaces meeting, and freely inoscu- lating with each other. These blood-vessels, as al- ready stated, have been produced from arteries pos- sessing different powers, and hence the newly formed assume actions similar to those of the primary, and thereby interstitial matter is deposited of its proper kind and in its proper place, a cuticular membrane superficially, then cellular tissue, afterwards muscle, and so on according to the primary tissues which had been divided ; these parts do not at first resem- ble exactly the corresponding natural tissues, but by the continued action of the new vessels, they are moulded and prepared for the due performance of their respective functions. If the degree of action necessary for the accomplishment of these processes increase to inflammation, adhesion is interrupted till the action be lowered to its previous standard. From

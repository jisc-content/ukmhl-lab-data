294 OF ULCEUS OF THE GENITAL ORGANS, thing is seen but an extensive ulcerated surface covered with white adherent matter, and exhaling an offensive foetor, particularly when the bones are affected. Respiration is nasal, and the speech in- distinct. When the larynx becomes affected, the patient may be almost considered as lost; phthisis haryngea is established, the symptoms and treatment of which will be afterwards mentioned. The muti- lating affection of the nose does not seem to be pro- duced by any other form of the venereal disease. Along with the eruption and its after effects, severe pains in the articulations, particularly in the knee joint, often occur, and are always much aggravated during the night. Nodes seem to be produced only in those cases in which mercury is exhibited ; their most usual situation is on the fore part of the tibia; severe pain is felt in the part, which becomes slightly swollen, and of a bright red colour ; the swelling feels dense and firm, being a simple enlargement of the bone. They often occur when the patient is taking mercury, and when in fact the constitution is completely satu- rated with it.

219 OF TUMOUllS. lisemorrhage occurred from the wound, more than an occasional oozing. Meantime the sore extended, chiefly towards the axilla, and there appeared to be an immense collection of coagula in the wound, retained only by a thin layer of coagulating lymph. The discharge from the flabby granulations was very offensive, and the head of the humerus could be felt lying on the fore part of the joint, and out of the glenoid cavity. He became much emaciated, his appe- tite failed, he gradually sunk, and died five months after the performance of the operation. I obtained the diseased parts, which presented the following appearances. Portions of the acromion process, supe- rior costa, and spine of the scapula, were of their natural appearance. But the coracoid process, the glenoid cavity, and the cervix, were entirely destroy- ed, and their situation occupied by an irregular broken-down tumour, consisting of osseous spiculae, and cancelli, irregularly disposed, and forming cavities which were filled with blood, partly fluid and partly coagulated. The head of the humerus was extensively absorbed. The articulating cartilage was almost en- tirely destroyed, particularly on the inner side, where a large portion of the bony matter had also been removed. The ulcerated surfaces were of a dark, bloody colour. In reviewing the particulars of this case, no one can doubt that the diseased parts could have been readily removed along with the limb, and that the operation would have afforded a good chance of recovery.

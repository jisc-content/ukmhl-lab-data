OF TETAMUS. 263 inflammation, and was filled with a viscid mucus. In some instances there are evident marks of inflamma- tion of the spinal chord ; the vessels, more especially at the lower part, are found enlarged, tortuous, and en- gorged with blood; portions of lymph are seen depo- sited on the arachnoid covering, and a serous fluid is efiused, not unfrequently mixed with blood. Such ap- pearances, however, are not observed in every case of fatal tetanus, and therefore it cannot be asserted as a fact, that the disease is dependent on a morbid condi- tion of thespinal chord,though in certain cases the two affections co-exist. By some it has been supposed, that in consequence of the distended and engorged state of the spinal arteries, the origins of the nerves are stimu- lated, and that a morbid affection of them ensues, giving rise to the tetanic symptoms ; but want of uni- formity in the morbid appearances prevents such a cause from being generally received as the origin of tetanus. This disease is one of the most intractable with which the surgeon has to contend. In the acute form, time is scarcely allowed for remedies; and in the advanced stage,it is with much difficulty that medicine can be received internally. Of course all irritations must be removed, both local and general, as far as that can be accomplished. If the patient be robust, and if the tetanic symptoms be ushered in with arterial incitement, general depletion ought certainly to be practised; and if the symptoms be such as to render the propriety of general bleeding dubious, blood may be abstracted locally, from the back of the head, or

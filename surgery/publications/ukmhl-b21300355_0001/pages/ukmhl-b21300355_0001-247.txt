OF WOUNDS. 227 the pericardial cavity being completely filled. In wounds, hcemorrliage is the symptom which most alarms the bystanders, and which demands imme- diate attention; but to operate successfully, the sur- geon must divest himself of all fear, and learn to: look boldly on the open mouths of arteries. Effusion of blood ceases spontaneously even from considerable vessels, on faintness supervening, and thus many lives are saved ; but as soon as reaction commences, it generally recurs, and may prove fatal, unless pro- per measures be resorted to. When an artery is divided, its extremity retracts within the sheath, contracts, and coagulation occurs ; thus the orifice is obstructed, and a temporary barrieri is formed to further haemorrhage. The tube, how- ever, is permanently closed by effusion of lymph from its orifice, and consolidation of the surrounding parts. The circumstances which folloAV division of an artery, are these:â€”The immediate effect is retrac- tion of its ends within the investing sheath, and a simultaneous contraction of the coats, so as to dimi- nish the calibre. From the superior orifice, there is necessarily a profuse flow of blood, which is dischar- ged through the sheath that formerly enclosed that part of the vessel which has retracted. After consi- derable effusion of blood, the flow becomes slower and less profuse; particles of blood adhere to those fibres which previously connected the artery to the sheath, but which were lacerated by the sudden retraction of the divided extremity; these particles coagulate, and lessen the canal through which the blood is dischar-

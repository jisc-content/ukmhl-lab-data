86 OF INFLAMMATION OF space, whilst others treat of the mysteries of internal disorders, and promulgate the best modes of allevi- ating or curing them. It is, however, the province of the surgeon to treat the inflammatory affections of some of the serous membranes, and the consequences of inflammatory action in most of them; and it is therefore highly necessary that he understand the symptoms, progress,and consequences of such actions. The affections of the serous membranes are principal- ly under the management of the physician ; but they not unfrequently follow wounds and surgical opera- tions, and the diseases of several of them are purely surgical. Inflammation of a serous membrane is attended with heat and pain, increased by motion of the parts and by pressure ; the natural secretion is increased in quantity, the process of exhalation being incited, and that of absorption weakened ; the serous fluid accumulates. The secretion becomes altered in quality, and assumes a milky appearance ; lymph is effused, and floats in the fluid, or adheres to the surface of the membrane, which is rough and floccu- lent. The adherent lymph becomes organized, being penetrated by numerous blood-vessels ; and thus the original membrane is, in many instances, much thick- ened, chiefly from the addition of new matter, though also from enlargement of its blood-vessels and open- ing out of the primitive tissue. AMien inflamed surfaces, which have been altered, both in texture and function, in consequence of inflammatory action, remain for a short time in contact with each other, lymph is effiised and penetrated by blood-vessels from

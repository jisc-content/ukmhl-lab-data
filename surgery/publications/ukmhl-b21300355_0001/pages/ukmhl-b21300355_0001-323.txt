AND THEIR CONSEQUENCES. 303 cellular tissue, and not in the substance of the enlarged gland, cicatrization, and far less a permanent cure, cannot be expected until the prominent and indurated part have been destroyed, as by the caustic potass. In the phagedena, bread and water poultices are, in the first place, to be applied, and the pain and irritation may be soothed by solutions of opium, &c.; if bands of skin intersect the ulcerated parts, they are to be removed, as being a source of irritation, which pre- vents healing ; if the fraenum prseputii be surround- ed by ulceration and undermined, it must be divided for a similar reason. After the process of destruc- tion has ceased, gently stimulating washes will pro- mote contraction of the sore. It is an important fact, that all primary ulcers heal without mercury. Cavillers object to the mercurial washes, supposing that they may act by affecting the constitution. The sores with hardened edges, chancres, heal as well as others, when mercury is not employed, but much more slowly. In others the mercury is injurious; in chancres it promotes the cure. In any case, I would never think of ordering it, imless the cure were very tedious; then mercury may be advantageously used, and moderately continued, until the callosity disap- pear. In chancre, as already noticed, mercury proves beneficial in all the stages of the sore; but, in all others, it can only be of use when the sore, becoming station- ary, shows no disposition to contract. Considering that chancres are now very seldom met with, it would seem that very little mercury is required in the treat-

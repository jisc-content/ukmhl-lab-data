AFFECTIONS OF THE ARTERIAL SYSTEM. 145 calcareous matter is insinuated, either in minute par- ticles or in broad laminae, amongst the fibres of the muscular tunic, is also found external to it, and occa- sionally situated in the cellular coat. In fine, the various component parts of the parietes of the vessel degenerate, according to the degree of advancement which the disease has attained; and such a condition of the tunic is the predisposing cause to ulceration of the internal coat, and subsequent effusion of blood. During violent and sudden exertions, the more brittle parts may burst, either at a certain point, or throughout the whole circumference of the artery; and on this such results will supervene as on ulcera- tion of the internal tunic. Ecchymosis takes place imder the cellular coat, which becomes thickened, and incorporated with, and strengthened by, the surrounding tissues ; this is the incipient state of an Aneurismal tumour. The effusion of blood, gradually increasing, distends the cellular coat forming the cavity into which it is poured, and produces a tumour of a size proportional to the distensibility of the tunic and the force of the efiusion. An aneurism, however, may exist from simple dilatation of a portion of the vessel, gradually increasing, and forming a cavity in which the blood accumulates. At one time it was supposed that all spontaneous aneurisms were caused by simple dilata- tion of the canal, but such an opinion has been long shown to be incorrect, and the term of true aneurism is now confined to that tumour and accumulation of

244 OF WOUNDS. sed lymph be fully organized, and converted into a secreting surface, adhesion will not go on when they are placed in contact; but the organized lymph will deposit matter similar to itself, and pus will also be secreted; in fine, the wound will heal by granulation, and the union will not be so rapid as in the former instance. If union by the first intention does not take place, then all the applications to procure it must be aban- doned, all sutures, plasters, compresses, &c. must be dismissed, for they now can do no good, and may be productive of harm ; the attention, on the contrary, must be directed to effecting union by granulation; with this view, other means are to be chosen, so that to continue those which were formerly used to promote adhesion would be absurd, when adhesion can no longer be expected. The stitches must then be taken out; when inflammation has gone off, and oedema remains, the parts are to be supported ; and by atten- tion to position, and gentle bandaging, the size of the wound will be diminished. Inflammation must be subdued by the usual means, and suppuration en- couraged by fomentation and poulticing. After inflam- mation has subsided, tension disappeared, j^urulent discharge occurred, and granulations formed, the edges of the wound are to be gently brought toge- ther, so as to render the quantity of new matter requisite for filling up the cavity as small as pos- sible. Nature will then accomplish the union in her own way, and we can only assist and minister to her; for who thinks now of healing wounds by

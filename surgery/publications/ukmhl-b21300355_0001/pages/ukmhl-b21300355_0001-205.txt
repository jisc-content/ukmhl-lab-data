185 OF TUMOUHS. parts, the surrounding cellular substance is frequently condensed and thickened, so as to form a cyst round the tumour; and when it supervenes on chronic tu- moui'S, the cysts which enveloped these remain, for some time, as entire and distinct as formerly, though the character of their contents is remarkably changed. Afterwards the cyst may be contaminated with the same disposition as its contents, assume the same ac- tion, and be converted into a similar substance. When the disease is seated in the lymphatic glands, the cyst is at first distinct, and gradually disappears ; whilst in this affection of the conglomerated glands a cyst is at no time perceptible, and the carcinomatous matter insinuates itself, and is lost, in the surrounding sub- stance. The carcinomatous tumour is of great density, and communicates a peculiarly grating sensation and noise when cut. In its section there appears a central point, or nucleus, from which dense ligamentous bands of a white colour proceed towards the circumference ; diverging in regular succession, as rays of light from a luminous body; or the larger bands subdivide into smaller ones, which follow a similar course with their parent trunk, or ramify regularly ; or, from the first, follow an irregular and intricate course, uniting with and crossing one another, so as to present a retiform appearance. In general, the interposed substance is of a greyish colour, extremely dense, and generally homogeneous, though sometimes granular. Often the ligamentous bands are so numerous, and so intimately interwoven, as to leave little or no room for any inter- vening substance. Sometimes, and most frequently in

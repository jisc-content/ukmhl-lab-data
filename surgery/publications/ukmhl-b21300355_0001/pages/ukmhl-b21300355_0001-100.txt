This, liowever, is attended with but little relief; for at the lower part of the cone is situated a considerable quantity of mortified cellular tissue, which must be evacuated before the cavity can heal. In this unhealthy species of inflammation, resolu- tion cannot be expected ; on the contrary, suppuration is the natural termination of the disease, and must be hastened by poultices and fomentations. A crucial opening must afterwards be made in the apex of the tumour, and the sloughs of the cellular tissue forcibly expressed. In the advanced stage, the sloughs are the irritating cause by which the inflammatory action is prolonged, and on their removal the cavity contracts speedily. If there is much derangement of the digestive organs, it may frequently be found necessary to admi- nister an emetic. If the bowels are slow, antimony and calomel are highly useful, in combination with active purgatives ; if the action of the bowels is more natural, these medicines may be administered in alter- ative doses.

246 OF ^VOUNDS. tality of the parts surrounding the wound is much diminished; and the whole limb is apt to become gangrenous, either immediately, on account of the extreme violence of the injury, or consecutively, from greatly excited action going on in parts whose power of resistance has been much impaired. In the treat- ment of bruised wounds, the position of the parts must be carefully attended to ; they must be placed in a state of relaxation. In general, it is unnecessary to retain the margins of the wound in contact, for adhesion cannot occur—suppuration must ensue, and is to be desired—and the dead and dying parts must be loosened and discharged before union can take place. Sometimes, as when a large flap has been detached, and the parts not much injured otherwise, approximation ought to be accomplished, for the rea- sons already mentioned. In almost all cases, and most certainly in those in which the mechanical injury has been severe, and its effects extensive, violent inflam- matory action is to be dreaded, and measures must be taken to avoid it: often, notwithstanding the prophy- lactic treatment, violent inflammation comes on, and then recourse must be had to the means proper for the subduing of it. Blood is to be taken from the part, if necessary, and cooling appUcations used, in the form of poultice, or lotion. The main indication is, to prevent extravasation into the substance of the limb, and strongly excited action. When the sloughs begin to separate, emollient poultices promote the suppuration and discharge of deadTTftrtter, and after- wards the sore must be dressed, according to the

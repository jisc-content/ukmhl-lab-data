OF TUMOURS. 221 and independent growth, is altogether absurd. The knife only is to be depended on. Many of the tumours first described have no ma- lignant disposition originally, and only require sur- gical interference when they produce deformity or inconvenience from their bulk. Yet even they ought not to be allowed to attain any great size, however indolent they may appear, and however little pain they may produce; for there is always a danger of their assuming a malignant tendency, or forming connexions with important parts, so as to render their removal either altogether impracticable, or at least attended with much difficulty. Tumours of every kind, when seated near important organs, must be early removed. Glandular tumours, however, even when of great size and long continuance, are not to be rashly interfered with, when they arise from irri- tation in the neighbourhood. Those in which it is feared that malignant action has commenced, cannot be trifled with ; and the only means which afford a chance of the patient's being effectually delivered from them, is operation. For this purpose, the external incisions ought always to be free, so as to admit of the after dissection being; easily and rapidly performed; they ought also to be made in the direction of the muscular fibres, whether these lie above or beneath the tumour. In this way, the margins of the wound are easily brought into apposition, and there retained; whereas, if the fibres be divided transversely, the wound will gape, and union by the first intention be rendered absolutely impossi-

154 OF INFLAMMATION, AND OTHER one ligature, two ought undoubtedly to be passed, and one applied to each extremity which remains attached to the surrounding parts. Again, it has been proposed, after the application of a double ligature, that the vessel should be cut through betwixt the two deligated points ; it being supposed that in this way the closure of each extremity will be more rapid, the cut ends retracting, and being, in fact, in the same circumstances as the extremities of arteries which have been tied on the face of a stump. Mechanical contrivances have also been invented for assisting in the compression of the artery,—such as the serrenaeud, presse artere, &;c.; these, however, are clumsy, insufficient, and often in- jurious. The single ligature, when properly applied, is much preferable to all others, and stands in need of no auxiliary means. In its application, the artery must not be separated from its connexions farther than is barely sufficient for the passage of the armed needle beneath it; but the external incision ought to be free, in order that the operation may be easily and speedily performed. By the firm application of a single ligature, the vessel is rendered impervious; and the internal and middle coats ai'e lacerated, so that the ligature only encircles the outer or cellular coat, which resists the influence of any force by which it may be tightened. The blood coagulates above the deligated point,—the coagulum is of greater or less extent, in proportion to the vicinity of a collateral branch, and is always of a conical form, the calibre of 1

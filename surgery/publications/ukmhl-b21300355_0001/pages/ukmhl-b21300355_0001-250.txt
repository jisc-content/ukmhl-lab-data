OV WOUNDS. 230 in that situation is necessarily in a state of constant motion. If the haemorrhage is suppressed artificially, either by ligature, or by otherwise well-applied pressure, no external coagulum is formed ; there are only the internal bloody coagulum, and the lymphatic effusion and consolidation of the compressed part. The na- tural contraction and retraction cannot occur in vessels partially divided ; wherefore haemon-hage is more violent and dangerous, from a partial than from a complete section. Again, transverse wounds are more dangerous than longitudinal; in the latter, the edges of the wound are spontaneously af)proximated on account of the structure of the vessels, whilst, from the same cause, the margins of the latter continue separate, and, in fact, the aperture is a complete circle ; the lips of an oblique wound M'ill be more or less apart, in proportion as it approaches to the transverse direction. When an artery has been punctured, the wound in the sheath does not cor- respond with that in the vessel; blood, therefore, accumulates between the vessel and its sheath, and there coagulates. The wound is thus compressed, its edges kept in contact, and the farther escape of blood prevented ; the lips of the incision are then agglutina- ted by effused lymph, and cicatrisation occurs. This, however, cannot be expected to take place unless methodical pressure has been applied from the first. Even from small punctures blood is effused under the sheatli and into the neighbouring cellular tissue, rapidly, and in such quantity as to prevent adhesion.

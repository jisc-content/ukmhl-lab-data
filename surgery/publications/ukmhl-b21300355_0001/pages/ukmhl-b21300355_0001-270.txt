Fre- quently it is so far absorbed after some time, as to leave only a firm line, whiter and more dense than the surrounding integument. Poisoned wounds are rare in this country. Wounds by the stings of certain trifling insects produce consi- derable swelling in some constitutions, and when the injury has been inflicted on a loose texture. In some parts of this country the bite of a small adder causes pain, swelling, and unhealthy suppuration of the part, with some constitutional disturbance, but the results are seldom serious, and never fatal. In warmer climates the bites of some snakes are followed by the most violent symptoms ; in some cases proving fatal in a few hours, in others after a day or two. Great swelling occurs almost immediately, attended with excruciating pain, and extends upward in the limb ; vision becomes impaired, the patient lies in a state of stupor, and ultimately succumbs under convulsions and delirium ; the symptoms vary in particular in- stances according to idiosyncrasies and the state of the constitution when the injury is inflicted. In this country the bites of rabid animals are more dangerous than those of animals naturally poisonous. Rabies most frequently occurs in dogs, and others of that species, such as wolves, foxes, &c.

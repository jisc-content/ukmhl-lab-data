The altera-' tion is at once manifest on contrasting the healthy With the diseased side. In the morning, the motion of the joint is constrained and stiff, and locomotion is difficult; afterwards, however, the patient walks with more ease, though still by very slight exertion the limb is speedily tired, and he is unwilling to use it. Pain is produced by pressing on the groin, or by tapping on the trochanter, and by pushing the head of the femur forcibly against the acetabulum. The inguinal glands occasionally become enlarged. As the disease advances, the lameness is more apparent; pain is produced and increased by motion, and by any attempt to stretch the limb whilst in the recum- bent posture. The emaciation of the limb becomes more and more visible, and the constitution often remarkably sympathises ; hectic fever supervenes, with its usual train. The degree of violence in the symptoms is very various; and it sometimes though rarely happens, that the disease exists, even exten- sively, and proceeds to^a favourable spontaneous ter- mination, without the patient suffering much pain; at least without his being obliged to desist from his â€¢usual labours. Such are the circumstances attending the first stage of the disease, in which the limb is lengthened, and there is no decrease, but an enlargement, of the parts composing the joint. When, however, absorption occui's, and the articulation begins to be destroyed.

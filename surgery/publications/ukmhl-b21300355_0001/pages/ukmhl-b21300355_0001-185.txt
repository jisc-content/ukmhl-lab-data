The integuments in the course of the inflamed vessel or vessels are of a dark red colour', and severe pain is caused by pressure. Often there is great oede- matous swelling of the limb, occasionally followed by the formation of unhealthy pus, diffused in the cellu- lar membrane, causing sloughing of that tissue, or of the soft parts more deeply seated. This disease generally follows a wound, as in vene- section, amputation, or accidents : it is also of frequent occurrence after the application of a ligature to the extremity of a vein after amputation. Many patients have died of this disease, induced by the application of a ligature to the vena saphena major, for the cure of varix. Wounding of large veins ought to be stu- diously avoided, and if wounded, the bleeding ought to be, if possible, arrested by pressure: a ligature should never be applied to a vein, unless as a last resource. The disease is a very unmanageable one ; the exhi- bition of purgatives and antimonials will be prudent, in order to evacuate the bowels, produce diaphoresis, and diminish the force of the circulation ; the pain will also be much relieved by the application of warm fomentations to the affected part. General depletion is not admissible unless at the very commencement of the disease, and local bleeding must be had recourse to with very great caution ; for by copious abstraction of blood, gangrene may be induced, or at least has-

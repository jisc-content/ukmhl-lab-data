OF ANEURISM BY ANASTOMOSIS. l6S assume an aneurismal action, cold and pressure are sometimes sufficient for the removal of the tumour. The most effectual remedy is excision, though it cannot be had recourse to in all instances; for when the tumour is extensive, and possessed of a hsemor- rhagic disposition, the vessels in its neighbourhood are much enlarged and increased in action, so that any attempt to remove the tumour by the knife is fol- lowed by profuse, and often an uncontrollable flow of blood. When excision is practicable, it ought to be performed remote from the disease ; for the tumour is to be cut out, not cut into. If the incisions be made in the substance of the tumour, or in the immediate neighbourhood of the diseased part, the tremendous bleeding which invariably ensues, will convince the practitioner of the impropriety of his conduct. At- tempts have been made to arrest the progress of the diseased action, by tying the principal arterial trunks entering the tumour ; but these have proved ineffec- tual, as might be expected, considering the unusually free and numerous inosculations which then exist. In a few instances, ligature of the carotid artery, on the same side with the tumour on the face or head, has jiut a stop to the disease; in the others, it has been unavailing. When the tumour is so situated, or of such a size, as to render the expediency of excision doubtful, it may often be safely and expeditiously removed by ligatufe. In some cases the tumour is prominent, so that it readily allows of the application of a ligature around its base; in others, it is flat and broad; in

186 OF TUMOURS. the advanced state of the tumour, the greyish matter appears to have been broken down and removed, its' situation being occupied by a glairy or turbid fluid, by ii soft pulpy substance, or by blood; the parietes of such cysts are formed by the whitish bands, which sometimes appear to be much thickened and coated with a mem- branous lining. Frequently, as has been already obser- ved, the external cyst or covering becomes assimilated' fo the substance of the tumour, and the ligamentous bands then shoot forward into the surrounding tis- sues, more especially the cellular and adipose, esta- blish a new footing for the disease, and thereby gra- dually enlarge the boundaries of the original tumour. All parts in its immediate neighbourhood become affected, and none withstand its morbid, and, as it w^ere, fascinating influence; bone, muscle, ligament, skin, and membrane, are successively or simultane- ously involved; and even the blood-vessels and nerves. From what has been already said, it is almost super- fluous to add, that the tumour is most malignant, incessantly encroaching on the neighbouring parts, and imparting to them its own disposition; and this too frequently continues to exist after the removal of the prime source and agent of the evil. The disease, in its commencement, occupies a minute and limited space; the tumour is of a stony hardness; is gene- rally of a globular form, and irregular and unequal in its surface. Afterwards it gradually enlarges in the way already mentioned, remains movable for some time, but ultimately becomes fixed by the increased extent of its connexions.

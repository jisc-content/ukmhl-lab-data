OF INFLAMMATION OF BONE, 132 is siifTering severely under the discharge and irri- tation. When the sequestrum can be readily moved about, or when, projecting through the external opening, it can be laid hold of by the fingers or forceps, attempts must be made to remove it. The surgeon ought not, however, to allow it to approach the surface, and project externally, for the natural discharge of the sequestrum is a much more tedious process than the removal of it by art, and by the irri- tation produced during its spontaneous ejection, the inflammatory action is continued and may be aggra- vated ; and long before it has appeared externally, it must have been completely separated from the living parts, and so admitted of ready extraction by the pro- per means. When it has been ascertained that the sequestrum is loose, it ought to be laid hold of by forceps, and moved freely upward and downward, so that any slight attachments by which it is connected to the neighbouring parts may be destroyed, whether these be minute filaments which still in some degree retain their vitality, or small portions of newly depo- sited bone, which are so situated as.to prevent the free movement of the sequestrum. In general, no impediment of this nature exists, and the dead bone is easily removed. Before extraction can be accom- plished, it is necessary to enlarge freely the external opening, in all cases where the dead portion of bone is of considerable size. If, on thus exix>sing the parts, the sequestrum be found detached, but still firmly bound down by the substitute bone, deposited over it eitlicr in one continuous sheet, or in irregular

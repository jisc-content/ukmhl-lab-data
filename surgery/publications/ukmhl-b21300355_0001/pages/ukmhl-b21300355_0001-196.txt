From this cause it is apt to assume a new mode of action, and to change in structure and in character, invariably for the worse. I have removed a few tumours, ori- ginally of this benign species, but which had degene- rated and assumed a malignant action. In one, dis- tinct indurated bands, radiating from a central mass of the same kind, are discernible. In two others, as a consequence of pressure, condensation and ulti- mate softening had occurred. The largest alluded to was removed from betwixt the shoulders of a soldier, and had borne the pressiu-e of his knapsack for eight or ten years.

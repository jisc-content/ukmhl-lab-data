Here, I must mention a very common error of supposing that where there is pain, there must always be inflamma- tion. Some diseases attended with the most acute pain, as Tic Douloureux and Cramp, are frequently unattended with inflammation. Many chronic dis- eases, too, are accompanied with violent and long-con- tinued paroxysms of pain, without excited circulation of the part. This erroneous opinion may be productive of high- ly prejudicial effects, as—the exhausting, by copious depletions, the vital powers of patients already very feeble—the consequent aggravation of the urgent symptoms—and, the then only termination of the dis- ease and of the practice, death. Again, it is true that we must bleed, in some cases, with the view of preventing the occurrence of inflam- mation ; yet the prophylactic treatment maybe carried too far, as in cases of violent injuries, or after severe operations.

Pains arising from local irritations are often treated in a similar way, whilst the removal of the cause would be much more likely to restore the natural action of the parts. Though inflammation does not always accompany the sensation of pain, yet the latter, in a greater or

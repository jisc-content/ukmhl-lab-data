AND DISEASES THENCE ARISING. 117 sensible from incited action; hence in the commence- ment of this disease, which is attended with more or less inflammation, the patient generally suffers most excruciating agonyâ€”so great in general as to prevent him, perhaps for weeks, from enjoying the least re- pose. The affected part is considerably swollen, but the enlargement is seldom so general or so great as in the diseased state of the ligaments and other apparatus of a joint. White swelling, however, may be the precursor of caries ; or, in other words, a disease commencing in the bursae ligaments, synovial membrane, &c. may extend to the bone; and breach of continuity, attended with weak action, be the conse- quence. In caries the affected portion appears neither to possess vitality enough to enable it to repair the breach, nor to be sufficiently deprived of vitality to be thrown off by the surrounding parts. When the parietes of the cavity have remained a considerable time in this inactive state, the surrounding vessels become more active, and the surface of the bone in the vicinity is studded with nodules of new osseous matter. This is not in general limited to the affected bone, if one only be the seat of the disease, but fre- quently extends to those articulated with it. The soft parts are commonly more or less thickened and rendered exceedingly dense by effusion of lymph into the cellular texture ; and so great is this thickening sometimes, that the knife is resisted as if by cartilage. The discharge which proceeds from the carious part is highly foetid, very profuse, is often poured through several openings, and the surrounding skin is exco-

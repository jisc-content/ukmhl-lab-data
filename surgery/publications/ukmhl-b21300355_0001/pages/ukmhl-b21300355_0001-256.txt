OF WOUNDS. 236 the cellular coat remaining entire, and to narrow the canal for some extent above the point at which it is applied. Coagulation then occurs within the vessel above the ligature, provided there is no collateral branch in the immediate vicinity. The ruptured margins of the internal coat effuse lymph and cohere; lymph is effused in the cellular tissue, exterior to the artery and to the ligature ; by the compression of the ligature, ulceration occurs in those parts which it envelopes, and it is discharged ; but before this, the canal of the vessel has been obliterated by an internal coagulum, and by the effused lymph. Afterwards, the same absorption and consolidation occur, as in a divided artery, the orifice of which has closed per- manently and spontaneously. When from a punctured wound profuse haemor- rhage ensues, there 4s reason to suspect that an im- portant vessel has been hurt, and the bleeding point must be sought for. After the artery giving out the blood has been discovered, the external wound must be enlarged, so as to expose the vessel, and admit of the convenient application of a ligature. It will not be sufficient to include the vessel above the wounded point, for the lower part will, after some time, be supplied with blood by the collateral branches, al- most as freely as by the large trunk, and, consequent- ly, bleeding will be renewed. Two ligatures are to be employed, one above, the other below the wound. The wounded vessel must be exposed, as already sta- ted, but not detached more than is suf!\cient for the application of the ligature ; and at the same time, the.

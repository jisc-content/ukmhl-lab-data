OF TUMOURS. 207 6 Of Osteosarcoma. By this term is meant, an enlargement and altera- tion in the structure of a bone, accompanied with the deposition of a morbid sarcomatous substance inter- nally. This morbid change appears to be the conse- quence of inflammation, and its origin is frequently attributed to some mechanical injury or local irrita- tion. In the commencement of the disease, the bone is slightly enlarged, perhaps somewhat thickened in its outer laminae ; and on a section of it being made, is found to contain a brown fleshy substance instead of its cancelli. This appears to be formed in conse- quence of a morbid action, perhaps inflammatory, of its internal structure. By the pressure of the new formation, the parietes of the bone are pushed out- wards, in some cases attenuated, in others thickened by deposition of new osseous matter, inflammatory action having been induced by the pressure. As the internal formation increases, the parietes are extend- ed, and are generally much attenuated, becoming in some places thin as paper, and diaphanous ; they also would seem to lose a portion of their earthy matter, for they are flexible, somewhat elastic, and not of their usual density. Frequently they are in several places deficient, and their situation occupied by a membranous expansion, sometimes thin and delicate, but mostly thick and ligamentous ; in some cases, the external lamina appears to be converted into a sub- stance resembling the internal growth, with which it

OF TUMOURS. 201 consistence. Thetumour is surrounded with condensed cellular substance, which is of greater or less thick- ness and strength according to the size of the tumour. Some of these tumours are supposed, and on good grounds, to be mere enlargements of the natural mucous follicles, in consequence of obstruction in their ducts, by hardened and vitiated secretion ; the cyst, therefore, will be at first thin and delicate ; its contents will resemble the natural secretion of the follicle, and in many cases may be readily squeezed out by the pressure of the thumb and forefinger. There is a black point on the most prominent part, marking the obstructed orifice of the follicle, and the sac is found to adhere firmly to the skin. Even after all other marks of its original formation have disap- peared, the situation of the orifice is indicated by small dark spots, by depression, or by a minute ulcer. Encysted tumours, or wens, as they have been called, often appear to be hereditary; seldom occur single, and are met with under the surface of all parts of the body. They have been divided into different classes, according to the nature of their con- tents : Atheromatous, containing curdy matter; 3fe- liceritous, containing a substance like honey; and Steatomatous, containing fatty matter, generally in a semifluid condition. But such terms are not ade- quate to express the nature of the internal structures ; for encysted tumours, like all others, are extremely various in their actions, and their contents vary ac- cording to the particular secretory action which the lining membrane of the cyst assumes; for the same

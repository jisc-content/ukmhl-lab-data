14 ON INFLAMMATION. The different states of the Vessels in their healthy, and in their incited condition, have given rise to much discussion. In the first place, considerable difference of opinion exists as to the relative share which the heart, the larger arteries, and the capillaries, occupy in pro- pelling the circulating fluid in a state of health. Some physiologists are inclined to attribute the principal power to the heart, the blood being propelled and returned almost entirely by the vis a tergo ; while they suppose that the arteries possess merely a degree of elasticity or tonicity. No fact seems to be better established, than that the arteries possess a muscular or contractile power, and that they act, more espe- cially the capillaries, independently of the heart in carrying on the circulation. The arguments, how- ever, stated by those who maintain a contrary doc- trine, and the strong objections to which they are liable, may be briefly mentioned. It is said, that muscular fibres have never been detected or shown in arteries. To this it may be replied, that in many subjects fibres, remarkably strong, and apparently muscular, may be seen, whilst in others they are finer and less distinct. Fibres, however, can always be perceived, * and the question can be only as to their being muscu- lar. In those cases where resistance has been opposed to the circulation by aneurisms, tumours, or other obstructions, the middle coat of the arteiy will uni- formly be found much increased in thickness. This enlargement of the middle coat is still more

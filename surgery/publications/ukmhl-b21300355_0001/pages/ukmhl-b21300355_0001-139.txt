AND DISEASES THENCE ARISING. 119 and carpus, of those bones which are in the neighbour- hood of the cai'ious ulceration. The superincumbent integuments are livid and cold, and pain is felt in the situation of the bones ; yet they are not atfected with continuous ulceration, but portions of their substance are gradually removed by absorption, so that they are much loosened in texture, and may be altogether destroyed, or come to consist merely of a thin and reticulated osseous shell; whilst at the same time their cartilaginous surfaces remain in their healthy con- dition. The constitutional disorder attendant on caries is at first very great, the sympathetic fever is followed by hectic, under which, and the discharge, many patients sink. The general affection, in some degree, keeps pace with the local, in violence and duration. The irritation is in some cases so great, as to destroy the patient in a very few months or weeks; but not unfrequently a constitution, by no means strong, will be enabled to bear up for a long period under very extensive disease of a bone. The paroxysms of pain and inflammation occasion fresh attacks of constitu- tional derangement; this occurs till the patient's health and strength are exhausted, and he sinks under the disease, or is relieved by the spontaneous or artificial removal of the cause. A natural cure of caries may occur in consequence of the diseased parts so far recovering their natural degree of vascular action, as to form granulations, and repair the breach; but most frequently it is necessary, for the accomplishment of this purpose.

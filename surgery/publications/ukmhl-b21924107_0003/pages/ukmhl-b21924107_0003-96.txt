I have met with several cases, in which an almost incre- dible quantity of faeces had collected, yet it produced but little constitutional irrita- tion. Accoucheurs frequently witness similar cases. In one instance which fell under my observation, the pressure was so violent, that it produced ulceration into the vagina; yet the enormous quantity of faeculent substance excited but little constitutional irritation; some fluid formed a passage by the condensed mass, and was daily ij^scharged; this, in a great measure, accounts for the absence of irritative fever. That it is from the check to secretion, that irritative fever arises, is proved by what occurs in children during dentition; they are sometimes put to bed quite well, yet in the morning an arm, leg, or both legs, are paralyzed, from the irritation of a tooth, the secretion from the intestines stops, fever is excited, and produces a hot and dry skin; but restore these secretions by administering purgatives and antimonials, and the irritative fever quickly subsides, although the paralysis

In the cavity of the abdomen, the in- testines will be glued together in nineteen hours after the adhesive inflammation has be- gun. I mention nineteen hours, because I have seen it produced in that time in a case of gun- shot wound. It may be in the recollection of some of you, that a Mr. Blight was shot by a man of the name of Patch, in the neighbour- hood of Deptford; the ball traversed the abdomen: I was called to this case, and Mr. Blight died nineteen hours after he had re- ceived the shot.

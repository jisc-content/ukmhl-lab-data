Here is a specimen on the table of a large aneurism of the aorta just above the heart, in which you may pass your hand into the opening produced by the ulceration of part of the ribs and sternum; those parts having been absorbed by the pressure of the aneurismal sac producing an increased action of the absorbent vessels. Here the pressure is exceedingly great; but the degree of in- flammation is very slight. In the same man- ner we see an aneurism of the aorta in the fore part of the spine, producing absorption of the vertebree by the pressure of the aneurismal bag, though no matter is effused; the ulcera- tion being produced by pressure, accompanied with slight inflammation, but not by any se- cretion of matter. 'From these facts we are led to conclude, that the formation of pus is not necessary to the ulcerative process, but that it is produced on surfaces of the body where it is necessary for the protection of sores, by covering the granulations. v' In acute ulceration the pain is severe, and the irritative fever considerable; but in the chronic the pain is less, and the fever is of the slow or hectic kind.

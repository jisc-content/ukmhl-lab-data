105 and that they consequently would more rea- dily adhere from their surfaces having been broken. Thick ligatures prevent the wounds from healing so rapidly as thin, and they are upon that account objectionable. After the vessels have been secured, the sponge should be applied, and all coagula of blood be re- moved, as this is very essential to the union of the part; blood is not the means but the pre- vention of union in such cases; for unless it be removed, the adhesive inflammation will not produce its desired effect. There is one instance in which blood favours the process of adhesion, and that is in the application of a ligature on a blood vessel; for a clot of blood forms in the artery, and is afterwards glued to its interior by the adhesive inflamma- tion : with this exception, the opinion of blood producing the process of adhesion, is to be banished from your minds, for there are two modes by which union is effected; viz. by ad- hesion and by granulation; therefore, remove all clots of blood, which will only act as ex- traneous bodies, and keep up irritation. You are to cut off one end of the ligature close to the vessel, and let the other hang from the wound: it has been recommended to remove both ends of the ligature close to the vessel; this plan has, however, been already aban- doned. It was, I have understood, deter-

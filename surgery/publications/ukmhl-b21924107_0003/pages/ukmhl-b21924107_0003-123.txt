93 LECTURE IV. ON THE ADHESIVE INFLAMMATION. For a knowledge of this process, we are indebted to that bright luminary of our pro- fession, the late Mr. John Hunter. Adhesive inflammation is the process by which divided parts become united. Inflammation has a disposition to sepa- rate the blood into its constituent parts ; for when blood is drawn from a healthy per- son, it separates into serum and red particles only; but in a state of inflammation, if, after it has been drawn in a free stream, it be al- lowed to remain undisturbed, it separates into serum, red particles, and fibrin. The red particles, with some fibrin, will be col- lected together at the bottom of the vessel; and the greater part of the fibrin, separated from the red particles, forms a yellow sur- face on the crassamentum, or what is called the buff of the blood, and the serum will oc- cupy the surrounding space. The coagula- tion of the blood is slower than usual, and the red particles are precipitated, so that the fibrin, having lost the red particles, con- E fleets of inHamma- tion of the blood.

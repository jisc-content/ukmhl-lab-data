179 and with respect to the rete mucosum, or co- louring matter of the skin, a little time elapses before it is formed, but it is repro- duced, as the following fact will show. The new skin of a negro does not become white as in Europeans, but is at first red, and after a time turns blacker than the original skin. I was struck with this in Guyâ€™s Hospital, in the case of a negro, who had been a sailor on board a privateer, and had received wounds in several parts of his body. I observed that the cicatrices were darker in colour than the original skin. We may conclude, there- fore, that the skin which is reproduced is true skin; that the cuticle is very quickly repro- duced, and the rete mucosurn after a longer period. The cellular membrane is also repro- duced, although it has at first the appearance of a solid fibrous mass which requires some time before it is drawn into the reticular tex- ture of the original membrane. Tendon's are very easily reproduced. If the tendo Achillis be divided in an animal, it will be reproduced in about a fortnight, or three weeks; but it will be of greater size than the former tendon. The same takes place in the human subject; as you may see from two specimens in our Museum, of the tendo Achillis, which had been reproduced, and which are larger than the original tendons.

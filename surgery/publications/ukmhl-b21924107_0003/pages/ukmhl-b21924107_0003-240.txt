210 tion the circumstance^ that you may be on your guard. The nitric acid is a good appli- cation, diluted according to the irritability of the part, and the liq. calcis c hydrarg: oxy- muriat: produces a good effect. Deep ulcers, having a malignant aspect, often remain in the face of old persons, with- out destroying life, although, from their ap- pearance, they portend the most direful effects. To such sores the best application is, the arsenical ointment. In gouty habits ulcers frequently form on joints, arising from inflammation caused by a deposition of the urate of soda. Per- sons sometimes apply with many joints open from this cause. A gentleman came to me from the country thus circumstanced: seve- ral of the joints of the toes were quite ex- posed, and the cartilages of some of them absorbed. I found in each of these joints a portion of the urate of soda; therefore, when it is necessary, you increase the open- ings through the skin, and remove the urate of soda, that being the exciting cause of the disease. It is curious how little irritation is produced in the parts when thus affected, for this gentleman walked to my house.

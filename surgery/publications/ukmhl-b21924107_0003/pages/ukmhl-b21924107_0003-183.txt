153 badJy managed; whilst on the other side, where the treatment had been more skilful, scarcely any vestige of a wound was to be seen. I have from very early practice, and subsequent experience has proved to me its use, been exceedingly careful in the manage- ment of these cases. Aperients, with calomel and rhubarb, should be given; evaporating lotions should be used: you must be strict as to regimen and diet; the food must be nutri- tious, but not stimulating. The best mode to adopt in these cases, is to open the ab- scess before the skin be much affected, and as soon as a blush has appeared; thus scars will in general be prevented. It is desirable, in opening the tumours, to use a veiy fine knife, for two reasons. 1st. A small opening is made; 2d. It does not alarm the person. The knife I always use, has the blade an eighth of an inch wide, and it ap- pears to the patient as a needle. When you press the sides of the wound, take care to squeeze out all the solid flakes of matter to be met with in scrofulous tumours. If this be not attended to, they will at last slough; but if, on the contrary, you carefully avoid leaving any of that unorganized substance, adhesion will take place, and the wound will heal. Almost every thing, in these cases, de- pends on getting rid of the solid matter.

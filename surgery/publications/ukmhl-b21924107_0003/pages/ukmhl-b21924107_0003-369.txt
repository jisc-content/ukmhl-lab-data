On raising the upper part of the cranium, a quantity of soft brain issued from the wound. The dura mater was much inflamed, particularly on the left side and posterior part. Under the dura mater was a collection of dark-coloured serum, and a layer of extravasated blood over the left hemisphere. The substance of the brain, on being cut into, exhibited numerous red points. The ball was found in the anterior part of the middle lobe of the left hemisphere, the brain around it was soft and of a dark colour.

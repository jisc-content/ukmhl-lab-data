Sometimes in these cases, to excite the adhesive inflammation, injections of tinctura lyttee are used; it readily produces inflam- mation ; adhesive matter becomes thrown out; and if you take care to keep the sides of the sinus in contact by these means, the parts will permanently coalesce. Sinuses of the rectum, however, are seldom cured with- out operation; indeed, I have met with but two such cases; one was that of a gentleman who came from the north of England; he had been annoyed by a fistula on each side of o 3

It is useful also in the exfoliation of por- tions of bone, in separating parts which would otherwise remain in the body, perhaps during the life of the individual. In three or four months a considerable portion of exfoliated bone will be separated by the ulcerative pro- cess. Thus in the' other Hospital the whole of the leg has separated. By my advice no- thing has been done, and the process of na- ture has been left to take its course, and has been performed in eight months. The bones themselves will separate by the process of ex- foliation, and thus nature will herself perform the operation of amputation without loss of blood, and with little danger to life. I shall now proceed to the consideration of ABSCESSES. An abscess is a collection of matter in a cyst, produced by inflammation. What happens in the formation of an ab- scess is as follows: First, there is an inflam- mation of the adhesive kind in the cellular tissue, by which the different cells of the cel- lular membrane become filled. A slight ul- cerative process follows; and the inflammation still proceeding, a little cavity is formed by

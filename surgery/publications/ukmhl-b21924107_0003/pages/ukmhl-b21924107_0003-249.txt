219 The next part which begins to separate is^ the cellular tissue immediately under the skin. ^â€˜ssue. Gangrene proceeds to a much greater extent in the cellular tissue than in the surrounding skin, because the cellular membrane is a part of weaker living powers. It is for this reason that a sloughing disposition is so dangerous in sores extending to the cellular membrane. A small chancre beginning in the pudendum of the female, or in the prepuce of the male, will frequently occasion the destruction of life in the part. Persons have absurdly supposed, that these sloughing sores are not chancres, because they have not the common venereal character. How does this happen? if a chan- cre form in the pudendum of an irritable fe- male, and has a sloughing disposition^ it ex- tends into the cellular tissue, inflames it to a high degree, and produces gangrene. In this manner the character of the chancre becomes destroyed. There is, at this time, an unfor- tunate female (only seventeen years of age) in the other hospital, who has lost a considerable portion of the external organs of generation, in consequence of a sloughing chancre. The hospitals teem with such cases; and indeed this deplorable result is frequent when a chancre extends into the cellular tissue, a part naturally weak, and rendered weaker in

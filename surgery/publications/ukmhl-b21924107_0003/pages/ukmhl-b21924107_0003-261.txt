By the calomel you restore the secretions; and by the opium you tran- quillize the system, and diminish the irrita- bility which leads to the destruction of the life of the parts. Do not begin by stimu- lating the constitution too much in cases of gangrene. The effect of opium may, in some respects, be similar to that of taking a stimu- lus into the system; but it is by diminishing the quickness of action, and thus increasing the strength of the body, that opium becomes so valuable a medicine in these cases. The best means, therefore, of preventing gangrene, are to restore the secretions ; to diminish irritabi- lity by opium; and, in some cases, to take away very small quantities of blood. If the gangrene arise from the application of cold, the treatment must be different. In these cases, the action of the parts is feeble from the diminution of nervous power, and it will be proper to restore it to a healthy state by stimulants of the most gentle kind. The principle in this case is, to stimulate gently, but to moderate the stimulus by eva- I poration. For this purpose the best applica- tion is the camphorated spirit of wine, ac- companied with gentle friction. If you are 1 called to a patient whose feet are benumbed i by the application of cold, you must sit by Q 4 Treatment of benumb- ed or frozen parts.

I was called, a short time since, to a case in which it was necessary to saw off a small piece of the tibia, after a long-con- tinued compound fracture ; during the ope- ration, a cavity was opened, in which was a small spicula of bone, embedded in a granula- | tion; the latter was extremely sensitive; the f extract of belladonna was applied to it, and gave immediate relief: Indeed, bones, though | nearly destitute of sensation in their healthy f state, are sometimes extremely sensitive when ^ inflamed. i The degree of suffering in an operation is greater or * less according to the absence or presence of inflammation. Not only is the sensibility of a part in- creased, but its irritability is exceedingly augmented by inflammation. If an hydrocele be injected when inflamed, it suppurates in- stead of adhering; and if amputation be per- formed through an inflamed part, the stump scarcely ever unites by the adhesive process, but passes into a suppurative, and sometimes a sloughing state. An intelligent surgeon, therefore, generally avoids cutting into an inflamed part, from the great pain which it 3

23 I have known a limb amputated, for com- pound fracture, above knee, and the patient die in four hours after, without any reaction ; the body was covered with a cold perspira- tion, and the pulse was scarcely perceptible. I amputated a manâ€™s leg above the knee, in consequence of a shot through the upper part of the tibia. During eight hours after the operation, the pulse was with difficulty perceptible; at ten hours it was 90, and very small; at 30 hours he was vomiting, and had no evacuation from the bowels, his belly was tense, the pulse was 114, and small: at fifty- four hours the pulse was 120; he was still vomiting; costiveness, and abdominal tension; no appetite, and his skin hot: at sixty-eight hours his pulse was feeble, and 140 in a mi- nute; the tongue had a brown fur in the middle, and was white at its edge. He had still vomiting, costiveness, and delirium: at eighty-one hours he died. The stump was in part gangrenous, and in part had the appear- ance of an amputation, performed only a few minutes before. Irritation in chronic diseases, or continued irritation, exhibits symptoms somewhat dif- ferent. There is a chilliness succeeded by heat, sometimes once, at others twice, in twenty-four hours: the tongue has a white fur, or is unnaturally red and smooth, as if de- jc. 4 Case.

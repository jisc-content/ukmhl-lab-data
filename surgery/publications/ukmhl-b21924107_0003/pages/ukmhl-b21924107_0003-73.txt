43 different joints, from its changing the posi- tion of the vessels. He died; and when I opened his body I found suppuration in the artery, for the space of two inches, above the ligature on the femoral, and inflammation of the inner coat of the arteries, in the parts in which I examined them. Veins, inflamed from wounds, form hard and broad cords, extremely tender to the touch, and if from bleeding, from the wounded part to the axilla. I have seen several pa- tients die from this cause ; and in the greater number the bleeding was required for dys- pnoea. Upon examination, the inner coats of the veins are found adherent, and I have seen suppuration in the vein; and once an abscess in the longitudinal sinus of the dura mater (which is a vein in function), of which we have a beautiful specimen in the anatomi- cal collection at St. Thomasâ€™s Hospital. When veins inflame from ligatures, they ge- nerally do so more below the ligature than above it, and excessive distension, from the interruption to the return of the blood, seems to be the cause of this circumstance. I have seen several persons die from ligatures being put on one of their veins, and the appearances on dissection were excessive distension from accumulated blood below the ligature: adhe- Veins.

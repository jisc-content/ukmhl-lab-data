The last circumstance that I shall mention on the in- is, the influence which the admission of air into air when cavities has in producing local irritation: it is into ab- my duty to state to you my opinion; you must think for yourselves, only do not rest con- tented with thinking; make observations and experiments, for without them your thinking will be of little use.

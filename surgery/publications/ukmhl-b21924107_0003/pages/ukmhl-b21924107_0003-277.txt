247 My colleague. Dr. Marcet, now deceased, but late a physician of Guy’s, endeavoured to of erysipelas, as remarkable on account of the great extent of the disease, and also as showing the beneficial effects produced by the exhibition of sulphate of quinine.— July 5th, 1824, J. Hawks, aet. 46, a plasterer by trade, was admitted into St. Thomas’s Hospital, ou account of an erysipelatous inflammation of the right leg, resulting from a contusion near the internal maleolus. The erysipe- las appeared on the evening of the same day on which he received the injury, and he had been previously in an in- different state of health. When admitted, the inflamma- tion extended nearly to the groin, completely surrounded the extremity; his bowels were confined, and he com- plained of heat and pricking pain in the affected limb: the constitutional irritation was also very considerable. He was ordered to take fifteen grs. of the compound pill of colocynth with calomel, and to apply a spirit wash over the inflamed surface: also, to allay irritability, small doses of calomel and opium were directed to be given every night. On the following day, my colleague. Dr. Elliotson, saw the patient with me, and ordered, in addi- tion to the calomel and opium, five grs. of the sulphate of quinine, five drops of dilute sulphuric acid, and two oz. of water, to be taken every six hours: with an allowance of three pints of milk daily. On the 7th, the inflammation had extended a little, and vesicles had formed on the thigh: the former medicines were continued, and castor oil ordered to be taken occasionally as required. 9th, As the pulse was rather feeble, I desired he should have a pint of porter daily, in addition to the other remedies. On the 10th, the erysipelas had extended up the side nearly to the axilla, on the abdomen almost to the median line; it also covered the whole of the nates and back: a spot on the dorsum of the foot appeared disposed to become gan- R 4 Experi- ment.

221 lated; the coagiilum, however, does not con- fine itself to the dead part, but extends to the living vessels which join it, and is, in this manner, glued to the inner side of the artery by the adhesive inflammation; so that the ves- sels are, as it were, hermetically sealed; and not a drop of blood can escape by the side of the coagulum. The same thing takes place in veins, the coagulum adhering to the inner side of the living vein, so that no blood can escape. If you amputate a limb at a considerable dis- tance from the part at which gangrene has commenced, you will still find the vessels sealed. The first amputation which I ever performed, was in the case of a person who had a gangrenous ulcer near the head of the tibia. In this case it was necessary to ampu- tate above the knee, as sufficient skin would not have been left if the amputation had been performed below. When I loosened the tour- niquet, I was surprised that the femoral artery did not bleed. On a closer examination I found that the inner side of the femoral artery was completely sealed by the coagulum which had extended, at least, six inches above the place at which the gangrene had occurred. It appears, therefore, that the artery is not only sealed at the place at which nature divides it, but at a considerable distance above it, in order to

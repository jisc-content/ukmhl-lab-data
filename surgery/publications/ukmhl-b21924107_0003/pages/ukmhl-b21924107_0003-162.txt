132 tended with the most salutary effects; for, if it were otherwise, the body would very fre- quently be destroyed by the ulcerative process. In consequence of this tendency, matter form- ed at a depth in the body, finds its way through the integuments, instead of proceed- ing through more important parts. Many examples may be given of this law. One of the most remarkable is this: Matter forms not unfrequently behind the sternum close to the pleura and pericardium, which membranes are extremely thin. From the proximity of these membranes it might be expected, that the matter would generally open into the pleura, and, by discharging itself into the ca- vity of the chest, destroy life. Instead of this result, however, the pleura undergoes no other alteration than that of becoming thickened, and while it is acquiring this addition of sub- Stance, the process of absorption is going on in the inner part of the sternum, an aperture is formed through it, and the matter makes its way through the bone and integuments, rather than through the pleura and pericar- dium. The same circumstance occurs to the peritoneum. If matter be formed on the ab- dominal muscles, the peritoneum is very rarely absorbed to admit the matter into the cavity of the abdomen; but the matter makes its way

106 mined by John Hunter, in the first opera- tion he performed for aneurism on the trunk of the artery above the tumour; for in that instance he cut the ligature close to the knots, and copious suppuration occurred when it se- parated. Ligatures can only be removed from vessels by suppuration or absorption (in the latter case they must be first dissolved, and then removed by the absorbents); and con- ceiving that if a ligature, composed of a sub- stance easily soluble, were applied to a vessel, and cut close to the knot, it might be dis- solved and then absorbed, I applied a cat- gut ligature to the femoral artery of an old man upon whom I operated for popliteal aneurism, and cut it close to the vessel; this case succeeded, for adhesion followed, and suppuration did not ensue. Although successful here, I have tried it in several cases since, and have not been able in any to prevent suppuration. I applied a silk ligature to the carotid of a dog on one side, and a catgut to the carotid of the oppo- site side. Upon killing the dog some days after- wards, I found the second ligature (catgut) buried in a cyst, and that the first had ulce- rated the artery, and advanced to the side of the larynx by a process of ulceration. Expe- riment and observation show that it is the best plan to cut one end of the ligature off.

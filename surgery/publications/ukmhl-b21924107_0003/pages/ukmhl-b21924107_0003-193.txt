M 2 its surface that no blood vessels could be seen. It was the fibrous matter covering the sur^ face of the granulations which had not yet received the blood vessels. A granulation may be considered as a gland, and the surface of an ulcer merely as a glandular surface. A gland is a part of the body in which secretion proceeds from the extremities of the arteries, and the blood which is not employed in the secretion is re- turned to the heart by means of veins which accompany the arteries. So, in granulations, the arteries throw a quantity of blood near the surface of the wound, and there secrete pus. There is a vein accompanying each ar- tery, and the fluid conveyed by the vessels is partly converted into pus on the surface of the ulcer, and is in part returned to the heart by the vein. Whilst the pus is secreting, fibrin coagulates upon the surface of the ulcer. Granulations are not good absorbent sur- Theirpow- ers of atr- faces in ulcers recently formed; but if the sorption, ulcers have existed for any length of time, the absorbent vessels readily take into the system some substances which may be applied to them. In this way we frequently see per- sons salivated by the use of injections of the oxymuriate of mercury. It is not an uncom- mon practice to inject a solution of oxymu- i riate of mercuiy into sinuses, for the purpose

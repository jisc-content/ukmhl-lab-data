Much blood was effused over the left he- misphere of the brain under the dura mater, more particularly on the middle lobe. The fracture only extended through the occipital bone; it commenced at the right superior part, and passed obliquely downwards through the crucial ridge to the left and inferior part of the bone. In this case then the symptoms of con- cussion first came on, and those of compres- sion succeeded. The extravasated blood producing com- pression of the brain, is met with in three different situations:â€”first, between the dura mater and pia mater; second, between the pia mater and brain ; and, lastly, within the substance of the brain itself. In the spe- cimen on the table before me, three ounces, the largest quantity I have seen, was effused under the dura mater. In this case also there was a large quantity extravasated, opposite to the anterior and inferior angle of the pa- rietal bone; and the dura mater itself was torn.

349 than the lacerated or contused; although I knew a lady, of high consequence in the country, die from the removal of an encysted tumour in the scalp. The cause of the danger attending such cause of wounds is^ the free communication by blood vessels between the scalp and dura mater ; as the vessels of the pericranium freely anasto- mose with those of the dura mater through the diploe of the skull, and, therefore, inflam- mation lighted up in the one, is readily ex- tending its influence to the other. There cannot be, therefore, a more absurd and inju- dicious practice than that of wantonly making incisions through the scalp, to ascertain the exact extent of the injury which the bone may have received, when there are no symp- toms to justify such a procedure; because such incisions produce new dangers to the patient, as well as add to that which the in- jury would itself produce. If, therefore, I am called to a case of injury of the head, in which there is apparent depression of the skull, yet there are no symptoms of injury of the brain, I would not render that fracture compound by making an incision through the scalp; and even if there were symptoms of injury of the brain, I would try the effect of free depletion, before I made an incision, as the loss of blood

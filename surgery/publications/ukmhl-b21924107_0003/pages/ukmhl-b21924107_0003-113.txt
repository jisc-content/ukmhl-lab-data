by placing tlie patient in a recumbent posi- tion^ and applying some iinen^ dipped in cold water, over the punctures, which become quickly closed. In deep seated inflammation, blood should also be removed by cupping. I shall now describe the local treatment of chronic inflammation. In the acute inflammation, the object is to decrease vascular action ; but in the chro- nic we endeavour to strengthen and change it. Thus in long continued discharges, arising from relaxation, we endeavour to restore the vessels to their healthy power of contraction, by employing astringent and stimulating lo- tions,â€”as in chronic ophthalmia we apply solutions of alum, of the sulphates of zinc or copper, and of the nitrate of silver, &c.; in chronic affections of the skin, we use lime water and calomel, or the oxymuriate of mer- cury, &c. Gonorrhoea, as I have already mentioned, is an excellent example of the dif- ference between acute and chronic inflamma- tion, and of the principles upon which the opposite treatment is founded; at first you diminish action, but afterwards stimulate to promote contraction of the dilated vessels. When you apply stimulating lotions, you should cover the parts with oil silk to prevent evaporation, by which cold would be pro- duced, and your intention frustrated.

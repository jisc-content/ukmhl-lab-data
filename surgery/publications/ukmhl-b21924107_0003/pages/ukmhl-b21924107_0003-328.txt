Here is a specimen, where a circular, or rather ob- long, piece of bone was, as you may perceive, completely separated from this part of the os parietale, by the cut of a sabre, and yet it became reunited.

Where, however, large holes are made through the skull, the aper- tures do not in general become filled with ossific matter, but by a tendinous structure, formed from the dura mater and united to the pericranium.

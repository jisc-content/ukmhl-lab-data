Their glands generally partake of this inflam- mation, and both the vessels and the glands occasionally suppurate. They more frequently inflame from common irritation than from the absorption of poisons. The arteries rarely inflame, excepting from wounds or ligatures. Inflammation in them sometimes extends even to the heart, when a ligature is applied on one of them in a person of bad constitution.

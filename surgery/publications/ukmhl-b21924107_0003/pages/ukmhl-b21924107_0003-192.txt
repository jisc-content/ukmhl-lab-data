162 Character of granula- tions. Their vas- cularity. the future formation of matter. But if the union by adhesion does not take place, then granulations are formed as I have described. The characters by which granulations are distinguished are these: their surfaces are uneven, they are generally red in colour, and they secrete matter. The vessels shooting into granulations are very numerous. If you inject an ulcer of the leg, the great degree of redness in the gra- nulating surfaces is accounted for, by the number of vessels divided into radiated branches, which enter the granulations, pro- ducing the arborescent appearance observed in them. In examining the structure of granula- tions, they appear to become vascular in the following manner. Arteries enter at the base of the granulations and then divide into radiated branches; from these vessels pus is secreted and an incrustation is formed pro- duced by a layer of adhesive matter, on the .surface of the granulation. This is a little difficult to conceive; it is a circumstance which, I believe, has not been observed, and which I learned in the following man- ner ; I took a portion of injected ulcer from the arm, threw it into alcohol, in order to observe its vascularity. After it was im- mersed in the alcohol, it was so opaque on

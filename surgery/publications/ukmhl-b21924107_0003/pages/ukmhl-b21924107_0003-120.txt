90 Friction. Friction has of late years been much em- ployed for the cure of indurated and stiffened joints^ consequent on inflammation ; it was recommended by the late Mr. Grovesnor^ of Oxford. This remedy was his hobby, and, like all other hobbies, it occasionally carried its rider into the mire; for Mr. Grovesnor sometimes recommended friction before in- flammation had sufficiently subsided, conse- quently it produced mischief; in many in- stances, however, when judiciously employed. Case. the best results are effected. A gentleman, in the neighbourhood of Nottingham, when shooting, received a severe injury to his knee: after the violence of the first inflammatory symptoms was over, there remained consider- able swelling, stiffness, and induration ; for these he was attended by Mr. Attenborough, an eminent surgeon, of Nottingham: as the gentleman did not rapidly improve, Mr. A. sent him to town, and he remained for a length of time here under my care; still the joint continued in the same state; I ad- cury, in promoting the action of the absorbents, is dis- tinctly and beautifully shown. I have seen many cases in • wdiich the lymph occupied as much as one half of the anterior chamber; yet, after mercurial action had been excited, and kept up for a few days, the lymph had en- tirely disappeared.—T.

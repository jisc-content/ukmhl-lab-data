183 and adapts itself to the surface of the ulcer. In this manner the granulations which spring from the surrounding skin, are well approximated with the circumference of the sore, so that the granulations on the sur- rounding edge unite with those on the sur- face. When, therefore, the surface of an ulcer is red, the granulations equal, rising a little above the edge, surrounded by a discharge of healthy matter, and the edge of the sore is nicely adapted to the sur- face, you will say that such an ulcer is in a healthy state. In order to produce this state of the sore, the best practice which you can generally pursue is, to apply poultices and plasters. When an abscess is opened, or a wound is produced which cannot be healed by the adhesive process, the best application for the purpose of exciting the growth of granula- tions, is a poultice. This poultice must not be too warm; as it is, by its gentle warmth and moisture, to encourage such a degree of action, as may promote the growth of the granulations, and form a soft bed into which they may spring. When the granulations have risen to the edge of the sore, this practice must be altered; and it becomes our object to adapt the granulations of the N 4 Pniitiples of treat- ment.

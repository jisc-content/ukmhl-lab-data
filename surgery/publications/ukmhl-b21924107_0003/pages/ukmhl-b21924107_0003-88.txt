The vessels of the inflamed part then are found to be dilated, but the arteries feeding the inflamed part are also dilated; so that if a limb be injected, in which there has been any considerable extent of inflammation, the prin- cipal vessels, as well as their branches, have their diameters increased. Inflammation is, therefore, a dilated state of the vessels of the part, an increased action of those in the surrounding parts, and the heart sympathising with the part determines a larger quantity of blood to the dilated vessels. This process may be illustrated by what is frequently occurring in the organ of vision; a piece of iron lodges upon the eye, and be- comes a source of irritation. A flow of tears is produced by the increased action of the lachrymal gland to wash away the cause of irritation. So an irritation upon other parts of the body leads to the determination of blood to the part, to remove by subsequent processes the irritating cause.

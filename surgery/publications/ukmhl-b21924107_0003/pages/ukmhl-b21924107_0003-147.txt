The skin, the cellular tissue, and the external part of the ligament will adhere; but the synovial surface, which secretes a mucilaginous fluid, does so with difficulty. The surgeon is therefore obliged to depend upon the production of adhesion in the ex- ternal parts. The same observations apply to wounds of thecae, which are very apt to suppurate, and the matter to take the course of the tendon to the wrist, and to produce by its confinement the most violent symptoms of irritation. In making openings into joints to remove extraneous bodies, it is desirable to draw the skin aside before the aperture is made; and, when made, it should be suffered to return to B its natural situation, and it forms a valve to cover the opening: in this way I first saw Mr. Cline perform the operation, and in the same manner I have since done it myself. The vessels of mucous surfaces being large, allow of the passage of the globules of pus more readily than such globules could pass through the vessels of serous surfaces, which naturally secrete the more watery parts of the blood. It does not in the least dimi- nish our admiration of the law, that the in- I 3

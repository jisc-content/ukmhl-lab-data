How- ever, from the immediate insensibility of the limb at the time of the accident, from its coldness, from the swelling which accompa- nied it, and also from the pulsation which existed opposite to the fracture, I was led to believe that the femoral artery was torn through. The question then arose whether we should amputate. Upon examination, I found the limb emphysematous ; the air had extended into the cellular tissue up the thigh to the abdomen, and putrefaction had already commenced. I perceived, there- fore, that the patient had but a few hours to live, and that it was useless to put him to the pain of an operation. Upon examination after death, by the medical gentlemen at Rochester, where the patient resided, it was ascertained that the femoral artery was di- vided. It seems extraordinary, when we con- template the situation of the thigh bone, with I respect to the artery, that a fracture of it I should not in one case in ten produce a simi- I lar result. A little knowledge of anatomy, I however, explains this circumstance. The ' Q 2

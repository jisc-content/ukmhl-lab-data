When the little openings are all formed into one, the dead cellular membrane becomes exposed, and begins to separate, hav- ing been previously confined by the smallness of the apertures. In gangrene of the extremi- ties, there is not this mechanical obstruction to the sloughing of the dead part. And though gangrene is generally difficult of cure, yet carbuncle usually does well, except when situated on the head or neck. Though per- sons recover from carbuncles of an' enor- mous size upon the back, yet very small ones on the head or neck will often destroy: indeed I never saw a patient who recovered from any considerable carbuncle upon the head; in these cases there is effusion upon the brain, pro- "ducing compression. The inflammation which attends fistula in ano will sometimes destroy the cellular membrane of the neighbouring parts, thereby occasioning an enormous quan- tity of the nates to slough, and yet the patient recovers. The peculiar treatment of carbuncle con- sists in making upon the surface of the swell- 1 ing, at an early period of the disease, a large crucial incision, for the purpose of affording the dead parts an opportunity of escaping; then apply the port wine poultice, and give R 2 Treatment of carbun- cle.

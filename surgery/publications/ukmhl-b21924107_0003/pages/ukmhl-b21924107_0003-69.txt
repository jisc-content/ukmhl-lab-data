Suppuration or secretion of pus. This suppurar is composed of particles nearly similar to those of the blood, only differing in colour, swimming in a fluid resembling serum, and coagulating, as serum does, when exposed to the influence of heat. 3d. Absorption or ulceration, which arises ulceration, from an increased action of the absorbent vessels, produced by pressure united with in- flammation, by which the constituent parts of the body become partially absorbed. The 4th effect is the destruction of the Gangrene, life of the inflamed part. From excessive action the arteries are first enfeebled, and then their vitality is destroyed; the blood coagulates in them, and gangrene of the part is produced. These are the local effects ; and the con- constitu- stitutional, which accompany them, are the effeTtL different symptoms of irritation mentioned in the preceding Lecture.

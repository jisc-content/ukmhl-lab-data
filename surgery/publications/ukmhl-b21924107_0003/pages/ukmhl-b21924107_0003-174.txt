144 swallowing a pointed bone. All she .com- plained of at first was, a soreness in the throat; but she was shortly after seized with difficulty of breathing, which increased until she died. On examination after death, I found, upon making an incision into the pharynx, that between it and the fore part of the vertebra, a large abscess had formed, which, by pressing the pharynx forwards on the epiglottis and glottis, occasioned difficulty of breathing, and in the end destroyed life. Shortly after this, Dr. Babington came to Guyâ€™s .hospital with a friend of his, who was labour- ing under great difficulty of breathing. He re- quested me to examine his throat; having put my finger on the back of the pharynx, and felt fluctuation there, I told him that this was a case, of which I had seen an instance, in which the patient had died from a collection of matter formed in the same situation. I. immediately procured a trocar, and passing it into the pharynx, a considerable quantity of matter was discharged, and the patient was relieved. This was a case, which, but for an operation, would probably have terminated fatally by the pressure of the matter on the glottis and epiglottis. In the same manner, abscesses in the perineum or between the pro- state gland and the rectum, .will, by their pressure on the urethra, sometimes occasion retention of urine, and destroy life.

Several of these cases have been examined, one more particularly by my former apprentice, Mr. Callaway, who found that there was great effusion in the scalp, between the occipito frontalis and pericra- nium, and also between the tunica arach- noides and pia mater. Although this in- flammation is said to be erysipelas, and is treated as that disease by giving bark, and other tonics, yet I believe both its cause and its treatment are mistaken ; as far as I am able to judge, it is the result of ten- dinous inflammation of the occipito frontalis, extending from thence to the skin of the head and neck, and that its treatment should be rather evacuant than repleting, as the danger results from the extension of inflammation to the membranes of the brain.

The third mode in which wounds of the scalp prove destructive, is by incisions be- ing made to trace fractures of the skull, pro- 3

342 Treatment of inflam- mation of the brain. It always requires great care when there is considerable depression remaining after an accident; and I will mention to you an in- stance of this kind, which will show you the necessity of enjoining a patient in this state strict attention to his mode of living. A man, who had received a wound in the head from a pistol shot, came to this Hospital: the wound healed kindly, but the depression re- mained. Whenever this man indulged even in the moderate use of spirituous liquors, he used to have violent pain in the head, which was only relieved by blood-letting. As to the treatment of inflammation of the brain, it is the same as is required for inflam- mation in general; with this exception only, that the blood should be drawn from the tem- poral artery in adults, and the jugular vein in children : by these means you abstract blood more readily from the part; even in adults you may, after opening the temporal artery, if the symptoms be not relieved, bleed from the jugular vein. In addition to this treat- ment, you purge, produce perspiration, and apply blisters to the head. I have seen poul- tices applied to the scalp, containing stimu- lating applications, of considerable use. The patient is to abstain from every species of stimulus.

50 Common specific. Specific. frequently slight stimulating injections are employed in this stage of the disease. Inflammation is common or specific. The first, with its terminations, has been already described, and is called healthy in- flammation. But the second, or specific, is of a peculiar kind, and is always unhealthy. In specific inflammation the vessels have a different action to the healthy; and thus, the fluids and solids which they produce have not the usual character. There are two descriptions of specific in- flammation ; one produced by a peculiar con- dition of constitution, and the other by the ap- plication of a poison. Gout is an example of specific inflammation. If a man, for a length of time, yields to every kind of injurious ex- cess, loading his stomach with food and wine, so as to weaken the digestive powers, he will probably excite what is called the gouty dis- position ; he experiences dreadful pain in one or more of his joints; severe inflammation appears, which terminates in the secretion of a matter, becoming solid, usually called chalk- stone; the name, however, is incorrect, as it has been proved by the analysis of Dr. Wollaston to consist of uric acid and soda; consequently is now named urate of soda. The formation of scirrhus, or cancer, is another example of specific inflammation.

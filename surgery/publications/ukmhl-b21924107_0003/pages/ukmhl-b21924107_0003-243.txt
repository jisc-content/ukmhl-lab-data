213 LECTURE IX. ON GANGRENE. Having traced inflammation through its ad- hesive, suppurative, and ulcerative stages, I shall now proceed to consider it in its most destructive form; namely, when it exists in such excess as to produce gangrene. We find that when inflammation is ex- tremely violent, it occasions the destruction of the vital power of the part. At other times, when there is a less degree of inflammatory action, but the powers of the part are feeble, life will still be destroyed; so that gangrene is produced either by an excess of inflamma- tory action, where the powers are natural, or by a less degree of inflammation, where the powers of the part are feeble. Gangrene may be considered as a partial death: this is its definition: the death of one part of the body, while the other parts retain their natural powers. The symptoms of gangrene differ accord- ing to the manner in which it is produced. When it is the result of high and active in- flammation, the pain attending its production p3 Defiuitiou.

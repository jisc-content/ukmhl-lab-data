170 Granula- tions sen- sible. Insensible. Granulations possess nerves as well as arteries, veins, and absorbent vessels. They are sometimes extremely sensitive; but this is far from being the case in all granu- lations. We shudder at seeing a person handle a sore roughly, supposing that it must give the patient extreme pain. Granulations which spring from parts endued with great sensibility, as the skin, are indeed extremely sensitive; but many granulations, such, for instance, as those which arise from bones, have no sensibility. If ulceration be pro- duced to a considerable extent, on an exposed bone, and granulations arise, a probe may be put into them, and the patient is quite insen- sible of your touching him; but if you apply the probe to the edge, or near the edge of the wound, he will feel it. Granulations, there- fore, springing from bone, in an uninflamed state of the bone, are not sensitive. Those, however, which spring from the cancellated structure of the bones, are, sometimes, ex- tremely sensitive. I have, at present, a pa- in one case, the disease was situated in the vagina, and in the other in the rectum. The pupils of the eyes were ex- tremely dilated, as from the application of the extract to the organ itself, and the patients were incapable of dis- tinguishing any objects for some hours. In the case of ulcerated vagina, I repeated the application, when it pro- duced exactly similar effects.â€”^T.

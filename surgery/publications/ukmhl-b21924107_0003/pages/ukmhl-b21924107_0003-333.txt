303 yet no vestige of fracture in the internal: here is another specimen^ with greater depres- sion ; and the third still more than either, yet the internal plate is sound. I am not ac- quainted with the histories of these specimens; but it is evident that the persons recovered by the reunion that has occurred between the parts which were broken. Suppose you are called to a patient who has had a severe blow on the head, and on examining the skull you find a portion of bone considerably depressed. You may still find this man capable of giving a history of the accident, and that his mind is not at all affected. On the other hand, you may be called to a person who has a fracture of the skull with depression, and who has lost the powers of his mind. If the fracture be simple, and there is no wound in the scalp, and no symptom of injury to the brain, it would be wrong to make an incision into the part, and perform the operation of trephining; for by making such an incision, you add greatly to the danger of the patient, as you may make what was before a simple, a compound fracture, and consequently greatly increase the danger of inflammation, which rarely follows fracture with depression, where the fracture is simple; but is a veiy frequent consequence of a compound fracture, which is

224 sloiigli, forming an aperture through the cheek of the child, by which its food escaped, and life was soon destroyed. Mercury, if used to excess, often excites sloughing, from the fe- ver, and consequent debility of the constitu- tion, which it produces. Whatever, in short, weakens the constitution much, disposes it to the production of gangrene; for the body, when thus debilitated, cannot bear any ex- cess of action. When the application of cold is the cause of gangrene, the effects are produced very much in the same way. The powers of the part, to which the cold is applied, are dimi- nished, and this diminution of power leads to the destruction of the part, under the first excess of action. There are also some parts of the body na- turally constituted feebly: as, for example, tendons. When inflammation attacks a ten- dinous structure, it runs very readily into a state of gangrene. Hence the danger of making incisions into tendons; the inflam- mation which follows affects the nervous system with the highest degree of irritability, and produces tetanic symptoms. It is not the injury to the nerves which produces tetanus, but sympathy with the injury to the tendon. It may be stated, as a general principle, that inflammation is the cause of gangrene.

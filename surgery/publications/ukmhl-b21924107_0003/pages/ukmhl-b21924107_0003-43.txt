13 by adding to excitement^ we may prevent the beautiful and judicious operations of nature, by producing too much action. The degree of constitutional irritation re- sulting from injury depends on several causes. 1st. On the importance of the part in- jured. A blow on the abdomen from the kick of a horse, by which one of the intestines becomes burst, renders the pulse scarcely perceptible at the wrist, covers the body with a cold perspiration, and destroys life in from twelve to eighteen hours. 2dly. In parts less important, on the extent of injury, as compound, when compared with simple fractures. 3dly. On the nature of injury, as in wounds: if a wound be a simple incision, it easily heals; but when contused, the parts must slough, before the injury can be cured; punctured wounds also, by the influence on the nervous system, frequently occasion te- tanus. 4thly. On the difficulty of restoring the injured part, as wounds of ligament, tendon, fasciae, or cartilage; and parts possessing but little vital powers, as in wounds and diseases of joints. 5thly. On the state of constitution at the time the injury is received; this varies at the different periods of life, and is modified by the Circum- stances on which the violence of irritation depends. The import- ance of the part in- jured. The extent of iiÂ»jury. The nature of the injury. The difficul- ty of resto- ration. State of the constitu- tion.

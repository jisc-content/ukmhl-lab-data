184 Impedi- ments to the healing pro- cess. Granula- tions too prominent. edge to those of the surface. For this pur- pose adhesive plaster, or unctuous substances, are employed, with a view of pressing down the granulations of the edge of the sore on those of the surface, so as to make them unite. These are the means to be adopted in the cure of ulcers. We first encourage the growth of granulations by the applications of poultices ; and when the granulations have risen to the edge of the surrounding skin, we press down the granulations of the edge on those of the surface. Such are the principles of treatment ap- plicable to ulcers in the healthy state. We will now proceed to consider the impediments which frequently occur to the healing process, and which render a different mode of treat- ment necessary. The first circumstance which renders the cure of ulcers difficult, is the too prominent state of the granulations, producing what is vulgarly called, proud flesh. In this state, the granulations rising considerably above the edge of the surrounding skin, are necessarily prevented from uniting with those of the edge. In order to prevent the continuance of this state of the sore, the common treatment is, to apply dry lint to the centre of the ulcer, and some unctuous substance to the edges.

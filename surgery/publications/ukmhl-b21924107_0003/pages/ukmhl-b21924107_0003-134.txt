104 The ligatures themselves should be small, and consist of fine silk; for nothing is worse in operations than the application of coarse liga- tures, excepting perhaps in cases of ossifica- tion of the arteries, when it would be justifi- able ; with this exception only, it is the worst possible surgery to apply thick ligatures to arteries. Now there are two reasons why small liga- tures are preferable: 1st. because they are less liable to escape from the artery; 2d. they di- vide the internal coats of the arteries more effectually: when you use a very fine liga- ture, the internal coats will be divided, and the external will remain entire. My friend Dr. Jones published an excellent work on the means by which arteries unite in cases in which they have been divided, or ligatures applied upon them; and he first stated the fact of the internal coats of the artery being divided by the application of fine ligatures; vessels are secured; the part is cleansed from coagula, and the dressing is completed. This practice is, I believe, generally pursued in the army, and also by many hospital surgeons ; and is parti- cularly applicable in the after treatment of those persons who have undergone operations for the removal of diseased mammae, or for the ^xcision of a testicle; in the latter case, there is most frequently a secondary haemorrhage, if the wound is closed immediately after the operation.â€”T.

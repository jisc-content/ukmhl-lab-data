( 365 ) INJURIES AND SURGICAL DISEASES OF THE LYMPHATICS. BY • CHARLES B. NANCREDE, A.M., M.D., PROFESSOR OF SURGERY AND OF CLINICAL SURGERY IN THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN; Emeritus professor of general and orthopaedic surgery in THE PHILADELPHIA POLYCLINIC, ETC. General Considerations. The superficial lymph-plexuses are so numerous, and are so situated, that poisonous antiseptic solutions must be employed with caution when applied for long periods to extended skin surfaces; for a similar reason the external application of germicidal substances beneficially influences the course of some varieties of lymphangeitis. Again, very slight fric- tion—even none that can be appreciated—may cause the penetration of organisms into the superficial lymphatics, giving rise to so-called dissec- tion and post-mortem wounds, where in reality no solution of continuity exists. There can be no doubt of this fact, since the cutaneous form of erysipelas, that is, a reticular lymphangeitis, has been produced by rub- bing pure cultures of the streptococcus into the unabraded skin, while, clinically, such cases as that of Sir James Paget’s occur from time to time. Exception must be taken to the statement of Mr. Bellamy, that the “outpoured lymph” from a wound “becomes ultimately developed into the bond of union whereby reparation of the injured tissue chiefly comes about,”1 since modern investigation certainly has long since shown that the coagulable lymph of wounds is not the same as the lymph in the lymph-vessels, but that the proliferated cells of the two sides of the wound, fusing, become vascularized and develop into scar tissue. Traumatic Affections of Lymphatcs. Traumatic Lymph-Cysts.—This is the condition described by Morel- Lavallee as a “traumatic serous effusion,” and is believed by Gussen- bauer and Kohler to result from subcutaneous rupture of lymphatic vessels. These soft, rounded, ill-defined tumors contain a fluid identical with lymph. Yol. HI., p. 27.

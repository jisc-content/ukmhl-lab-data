1030 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF THE FEMALE GENITALS. ing it in the male as well as in the female, and its applications, advises, in operating upon the female, that if the perineum is intact, the trans- verse incision should be two centimetres in front of the anus, but that if there has been partial rupture this incision should be directly in the middle of the tissue between the anal and vulval openings, while the lateral incisions should follow the internal borders of the ischial tuber- osities, and should pass beyond. The anterior flap is held by an assist- ant while the operator draws the posterior one below, and divides the tissues with scissors until separation of the rectal sphincter is accom- plished. when the finger is used in the median line to separate between the rectum and the vagina; the blunt dissection must now for the mo- ment be discontinued, and the scissors used, by means of a few cuts Fig. 1785.

(Bonnet et Petit.) net et Petit.) with which the fat of the ischio-rectal sinus is traversed and the inferior border of the levator divided; the separation with the finger is then re- sumed until again some fibres of the muscle require scissors for division, when the fingers readily complete the work, and the peritoneal cul-de- sac is reached, recognized by its bluish color, caught with tenaculum forceps, and cut with scissors, the cut being continued on each side as far as necessary. A pyramidal opening is thus secured, quite large enough for the introduction of the hand. In this operation there is more danger of wounding the rectum than the vagina, if one does not accurately pursue the natural plane of cleavage between the two or- gans, or when the scissors are used to divide strong adhesions; therefore, to guard against this accident, Willems advises not to draw too strongly upon the rectal flap nor to press too greatly with the finger in the separa-

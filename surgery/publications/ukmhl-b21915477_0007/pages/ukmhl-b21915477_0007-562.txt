DISEASES OF THE JOINTS. 502 Weight and Pulley Apparatus for Bed-Traction. adopted elsewhere as the most useful aid to the treatment- of hip disease by recumbency. If deformity is present, the same frame is used, and the leg should then be pulled upon in the line of deformity, and supported in the de- formed position by an inclined plane. (Fig. 1645.) Traction during recumbency may also be effected by applying a long traction splint to the limb. (Fig. 1646.) Treatment by recumbency is in my judgment not to be advocated as a routine, long-continued method in hip disease; but simply as a temporary measure to meet the indications which have been noted. As a rule some ambulatory treatment is to be preferably adopted, making it possible for the tuberculous child to obtain exercise and air within the limits of safety to the joint. The place which recumbency should This frame should be a little longer and a little wider than the child, who is secured to it by two straps crossing over the chest and passihg under the frame. A towel is passed around the frame and the pelvis, securing fixation there. Extension is then made in the usual way by weight and pulley from the foot of the bed. (Fig. 1644.) This does away with the necessity of the long splint and the various appliances de- scribed to secure fixation. It forms a part of the routine treatment of hip disease in the Children's Hospital in Boston, and is gradually being Fig. 1644.

897 LAPAROTOMY. Laparotomy. It has been urged by Mr. Davies-Colley and Dr. R. P. Harris that the term laparotomy, which from its derivation strictly means an inci- sion into the lateral portion of the abdomen, or the flank, should be abandoned and should be replaced by coeliotomy, from the Greek word xodia (signifying, inter alia, “the belly”) and riftym (“X cut”). But, as a matter of fact, xudia is also used by Hippocrates for the cavities of the lungs and for the sockets of joints, by Aristotle for the ventricles of the heart, and by Galen for the fleshy parts or “bellies” of muscles; so that whatever charge of inaccuracy may be brought against “laparotomy,” as applied to a median operation, its proposed substitute seems to me still more objectionable on account of its indefi- niteness; and the former term, having been adopted into surgical litera- ture in all civilized countries, may well be allowed to remain. The statistics of laparotomy for intestinal obstruction continue to grow, so that to the 316 cases tabulated in Vol. VI.,1 I was, in the sixth edition of my “Principles and Practice of Surgery,”2 enabled to add 279 more, giving a total of 625, of which nearly two-thirds appear to have terminated fatally. The mortality is still greatest in cases of intussusception, and I see no reason for changing the opinion previ- ously expressed that operation is as a rule best avoided in dealing with acute invagination; in chronic cases (which are very rare) laparotomy may be called for, and in cases of acute obstruction other than intus- susception, it often affords the only hope of recovery. The annexed table, similarly arranged to that in Vol. VI.,3 shows the results of the operation in the 625 cases referred to.

Only very weak antiseptic solutions, if any, should be em- 1 Pages 69-76. - Page 923. Philadelphia, 1893. 3 Page 69. VOL. VII.—57

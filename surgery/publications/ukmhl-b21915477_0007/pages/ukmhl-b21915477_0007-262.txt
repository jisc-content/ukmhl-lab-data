AMPUTATIONS. 206 separated from before backward. The statistics of this operation have been considerably increased, and to the fifty-one cases tabulated in Vol. I., page 654, may be added 39 additional cases, as follows:— Additional Cases of Amputation Above the Shoulder.

Additional instances of accidental avulsion of the arm and scapula have been recorded by George, Loumeau, Ogilvie, and Stennett, giving, with those referred to in Vol. I., page 654, a total of 18, of which at least 17 are said to have ended favorably. Amputation of the Leg.—Further experience has led me to revise the opinion expressed in Vol. I., page 666, in favor of the circular method in amputating in the lower third of the leg, and I now give the preference to the external flap method at all points between the knee and the ankle. I have found, however, that it is often difficult to shape the flap properly by transfixion in the way which Sedillot recom- mended, and I have therefore modified his procedure by cutting the' flap from without inward, beginning with an incision of three or four inches along the inner edge of the tibia, then crossing the outer side of the leg transversely, and finally cutting upward on the posterior surface, in a line diametrically opposite to that of the wound first made; the flap thus marked out is raised, keeping close to the fibula, and an inner, shorter flap is then formed in the same way; the bones are sawn through at the highest point exposed by the reflection of the flaps—the fibula somewhat higher than the tibia—and the operation is completed in the ordinary manner. The great advantage of the external flap method is that it enables the sawn end of the tibia to be thoroughly covered, and that, the flaps being light and brought together laterally, there is little or no risk of the tibial spine causing ulceration and pro- truding, as it so commonly does after amputation by other methods. The resulting cicatrix is drawn well away from the line of pressure, and the stump is firm and well-formed, so that the patient can, if nec- essary, bear a considerable amount of weight on the end of the stump itself.

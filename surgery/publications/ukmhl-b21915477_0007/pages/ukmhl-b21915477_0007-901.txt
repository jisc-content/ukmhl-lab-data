841 CARCINOMA OF THE BREAST. of carcinomatous infiltration of the axillary glands, and Mr. Gibbes has proved that such infiltration may be present though it cannot be rec- ognized by ordinary means. Schmidt1 in 228 cases, including 2 oc- curring in men, found the glands affected in 97 per cent. The glandu- lar invasion had been recognized before operation in 71.77 per cent.; in 26.25 per cent, the complications were demonstrated only at the time of operation. These contradictory statistics are due to the greater number of metastases recorded in later reports. (Korteweg.) Simple Cases. With Axillary Infolvment.

According to Weir' there are axillary complications in 97 per cent, of all cases. The great increase in the ratio of metastasis noted of late years is due to the fact that the earlier observers required more physical evidence of glandular implica- tion, the axilla being left untouched unless a tumor could be distinctly felt. Hence also the high rate of recurrence and the gloomy prognosis of that time. Wyeth3 reports that of 48 patients operated upon be- tween 1880 and 1890, 42 died and the remaining 6 had recurrences. In rare instances it must be admitted that the disease appears in the scar of the operation, de novo, from irritation, as it might in any other scar from a similar cause, uninfluenced except by a constitutional pre- disposition. The influence upon recurrence of the duration of the disease before operation has been much studied. The statistics on this point vary so much with the rapidity of growth and the degree of malignancy, and are so dependent on the patient’s own observations, that they are of doubtful value. Korteweg4 concludes from 322 cases in which the age of the tumor before operation was approximately known, that (1) the more malignant the cancer the earlier it comes to operation; (2) the more malignant the cancer the sooner recurrence leads to death.

Small tumors, slowly growing, frequently exist for months and even years without exciting apprehension. Such tumors very rarely come to operation until the axilla is seriously infected. Could extensive dissec- tions be made in such cases it is certain that the above table would be much modified. 1 Deutsche Zeitschrift. f. Cliir., 1887. 2 Med. Record, December 31, 1892. 3 Trans.

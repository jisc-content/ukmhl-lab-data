538 EXCISIONS AND RESECTIONS. 16 Male, child, 1894 Pes varus Pennsylvania Hospital. do. seen. In traumatic cases the operation is a very satisfactory one, as it is in cases of chronic disease in children; but in adults, particularly in tuberculous cases, it is very difficult to be sure that all the morbid tis- sue has been removed, convalescence is greatly prolonged, and recur- rence in the neighboring parts is apt to be met with, so that, upon the whole, I am disposed, in this class of cases, to look upon amputa- tion as preferable, being a more certain means of affording relief, and enabling the patient to return sooner to the active duties of life. In the after-treatment of ankle-joint excisions I have latterly ceased to use the special splint recommended in Vol. III., page 640, and have employed a simple gutter of binder’s-board, long enough to reach above the knee, and extending several inches below the foot, the limb, as an additional precaution, being placed in a large fracture-box. Astragalus.—I have removed the astragalus 16 times, in 9 cases for caries or necrosis, and in 7 for club-foot. In two cases of the former category the os calcis was removed at the same time, one patient making a good recovery and the other dying some months subsequently from pulmonary tuberculosis, and in a third case consec- utive amputation was successfully practised for recurrent disease. Of the club-foot cases six were examples of pes varus and one of pes valgus. The patient in this last case was a girl of 10 years, who made Table of Sixteen Cases of Excision of the Astragalus.

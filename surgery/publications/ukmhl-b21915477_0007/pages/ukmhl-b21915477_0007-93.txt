WOUNDS. 37 rectly an embryonic cell the descendant of an epithelial cell, will never develop into connective-tissue, bone, or cartilage cells. Nor will a con- nective-tissue cell ever produce an epithelium. Healing of Wounds.â€”When primary union is taking place, we have seen that a certain amount of granulation tissue composed of leu- cocytes, but mainly of embryonic cells of the connective-tissue type, is found between the wound-surfaces. Some embryonic cells also lie in the adjacent connective-tissue spaces, and they, not the leucocytes, are finally transformed into connective tissue binding the wound-surfaces together (Fig. 1556). When healing by granulation occurs, it is not so easy to observe the process of repair, and the part taken therein by the Fig. 1557. Formation of Blood-Vessels from Granulation Tissue. (Ziegler.) fixed tissue cells, owing to the infiltration of the parts with leucocytes. The microscopical changes are, however, identical with those occurring during primary union. Embryonic cells, for the greater part derived from the connective tissue present in all the organs of the body, com- bine with the leucocytes that have emigrated from the blood-vessels to form a new tissue, which gradually fills up the wound cavity and is familiarly known as granulation tissue. The blood supply of this tis- sue comes from the most superficial capillaries in the wound surface. Here a thickening at certain parts of the vascular wall is the first inti- mation of the formation of a new vessel. It gradually grows in size, forming a projection, and finally a solid strand. The latter unites at its end with sprouts from other vessels, or, as is most frequently the case in granulation tissue, it returns in the shape of an arch to the vessel from which it originally sprang. It is finally converted into a hollow string

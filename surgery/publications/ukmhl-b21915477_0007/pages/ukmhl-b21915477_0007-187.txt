131 HYDROPHOBIA. No death has been reported among these 104 persons, treated in 1892. It will be of interest to those who may desire to follow up the his- tory of these cases, to know from what localities the persons came, as follows:— 2 Alabama. 13 Connecticut. 2 Iowa. 1 Louisiana. 4 Maryland. 5 Massachusetts The following statistics of various Institutes on the principle of the Pasteur Institute in Paris, which have a historic value in the records of inoculation, are given by Dr. Paul Gibier1:— In St. Petersburg 484 people were vaccinated from July, 1886, to September, 1888, with a mortality of 2.68 per cent. In Odessa 324 persons were vaccinated in 1886 by the primitive method, with a mortality of 3.39 per cent. But in 1887 and 1888, 709 persons submitted to the intensive treatment, and the mortality was reduced to 0.60 per cent. In Moscow the Institute received 107 persons in 1886, who were subjected to primitive vaccination with a mortality of 8.40 per cent. But having adopted the intensive treatment in 1887 and 1888, 526 persons were subjected to it, with a mortality of only 1.45 per cent. In Warsaw, out of 370 people treated by the new method, not a single death occurred. In Milan 335 were inoculated; deaths, 0.60 per cent. In Palermo 109 inoculated; no deaths. In Naples 246 inoculated; mortality, 1.5 per cent. In Havana 170 were bitten and inoculated, and the mortality was only 0.60 per cent. In Kio de Janeiro, where Dom Pedro II. founded a splendid Institute, 53 were inoculated within a short time without a single death. It is stated by Gibier that England has been one of the chief sub- scribers to the Pasteur Institute of Paris, where a number of British subjects are daily cared for. tie refers also to the report of Mr. V. Horsley, the eminent physiologist, who in the name of an official commission composed of the principal scientists of England (among them Sir James Paget), recently declared that “M. Pasteur had dis- covered a method preventive of rabies, that was comparable to vaccina- tion against variola.” The technique of the successive operations required for the prepara- tion of the anti-rabic virus is as follows: The vaccinal matter consists of fragments of the spinal cord of a rabbit killed by hydrophobia, which are progressively desiccated at a fixed temperature, and in the dark. Eveiy day a fragment of this substance is injected, but every time a less dried specimen is employed, being nearer to the virulent state. The introduction of the active principles of the cords of rabid animals into the peritoneal sacs of rabbits, was found by Colli to produce rabies in from ten to twenty days. The period of incubation in dogs varies, and a report of the cases of six dogs bitten by a rabid animal gave the period of development as twenty-three, fifty-six, sixty-seven, eighty- eight, one hundred and fifty-five, and one hundred and eighty-three days respectively. 1 The North American Review, August, 1890.

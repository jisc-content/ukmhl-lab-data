108 GUNSHOT WOUNDS. what less, in the so-called “zone of explosive effect,” the cross section of the area of damage differs but little from that formerly observed; and the same is probably true of wounds received very far from the firing party. At the two extremes of range the bullet oscillates con- siderably; just as, as has been said, the spinning top “wabbles” in the beginning and at the end of its turning. Country. Type of Weapon.

Springfield .450 500 70 1300 Observation of a limited number of injuries received in actual war- fare and the study1 of many experimental wounds (by none more thoroughly and satisfactorily pursued than by Assistant Surgeon La Garde, U. S. A.) have shown that the injuries that are to come under notice in future wars will in some particulars he quite unlike those met with during the first three-quarters of the century. Neither the hall itself nor pieces of it may he expected to lodge, and, therefore, there will be few or no extractions to he made, except of foreign bodies acci- dentally carried in. Whether or not pieces of clothing will ordinarily lodge or be carried out by the perforating shot, remains to be seen; they certainly will be of smaller size than those torn off by the old bullet, and probably will be much less frequently detached. Proportionately less septic infection of the wounds may, therefore, be looked for, al- though the investigations of La Garde and Messner have shown that even if no foreign body other than the bullet enters, there may yet be septic organisms introduced upon it, the generally accepted opinion that sterilization must necessarily he produced in the firing not being correct. Von Beck has found that the bullet is much less heated than commonly supposed, the temperature of the recovered steel-jacketed, calibre .30 shot being but T8° C., and of the copper-jacketed shot 110° C. Deflection of the ball will probably not be observed. In correspondence with the less size of the bullet the wounds of en- trance and of exit are smaller than heretofore, the more so proportion- 1 In this study many surgeons have been much occupied : among them Delorme, Chavasse, Chauvel, and Nimier of France; Bruns, Busch, and Reger of Germany; Morosow, Tauber, and Pawlow of Russia ; Habart of Austria.

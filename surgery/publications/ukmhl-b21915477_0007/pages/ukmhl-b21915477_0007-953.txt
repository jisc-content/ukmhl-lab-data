893 SYMPTOMS, DIAGNOSIS, AND TREATMENT OF HERNIA. cries. The hernia is usually reducible when the child is held with the head downward, by gentle taxis over the tumor. It is very essen- tial that an effort should be made to cure the hernise of children by proper application of, and careful attention to, the truss. The hard pad (celluloid) of the Hood pattern, as recommended by Dr. S. E. Milliken, is light and easily adaptable, and can be kept clean. The truss should never be removed from its point of pressure except by the physician or by a nurse who has been carefully instructed in its application and use. In healthy children a cure is often effected within two or three months. In others it may be impossible to effect a cure. The importance of good feeding will be appreciated in this class of cases as in all others. If strangulation should occur, it should be relieved by operation at once; and in cases where a cure cannot be effected by the truss, and where the tumor is not readily retained by this apparatus, an operation for the radical cure should be performed. It is better to operate about the fourth or fifth year. The same opera- tion as advised for adults is admirably adapted to these cases. It is my rule, after the operation, to put children in the plaster-of-Paris spica at once, in order to ensure the recumbent posture. In all operations about the genital apparatus of children the iodoformized collodion dressing is recommended, because it hermetically seals the wounded surface and prevents infection from urine or other sources.

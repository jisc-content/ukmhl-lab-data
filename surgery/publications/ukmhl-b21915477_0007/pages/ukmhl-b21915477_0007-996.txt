UKINARY CALCULUS. 936 successful. This instrument is furnished with a tip, by means of which fluid can he thrown into the bladder while the instrument is in place, and it is alleged that by the commotion in the waters thus produced, Fig. 1743. the fragment, and notably the last fragment, is ///fm brought mechanically within the jaws of the litho- trite. In other words, as Chismore states, the stone seeks the instrument, saving the instrument the necessity of seeking the stone. Dr. W. S. Forbes introduced another improved lithotrite to the pro- fession at the meeting of the American Surgical Association in 1894.

My own straight tube with the soft- rubber flexible tip I have abandoned, because the perishable quality of soft rubber makes it particularly unsuited for this purpose, and really this tip has no advantage over others in use. The straight tube which I have advocated, with a Mercier metallic tip, has proved a very satis- factory instrument in my hands. It is necessary to chronicle the birth of a new washing-bottle, which Fig. 1745. seems to act upon a new principle and has been devised and perfected by Chismore. Fig. 1745 represents it. It is light and easy to handle,

>76 SURGICAL DISEASES OF THE HEAD. Technique of Cerebral Operations. We owe the modern technique of cerebral operations principally to Mr. Horsley and Dr. Macewen. The entire head should always he shaved. The loss of part of the hair produces such a grotesque appear- ance that from an aesthetic point of view it is desirable; and for the surgical reason that we must take every means to avoid infection, it is still more desirable to shave the entire head. Moreover this often re- veals unexpected scars. After the head has been shaved,, the patient of course should be protected against taking cold by a silk handkerchief or a cap.

Lewis. daily the median fissure, the fissure of Rolando, and in some cases the fissure of Sylvius, the fissure of Bichat, and others. The median fissure is easily marked, as it is about an eighth of an inch to the right of the median line, the left cerebral lobe being a little larger than the right. For marking the fissure of Rolando I have used with the best advan- tage Horsley’s earliest cyrtometer (Fig. 1675), as modified by Dr. Mor- ris J. Lewis. This consists of an antero-posterior arm Id inches long and a lateral arm about 6 inches long. The lateral arm is fixed upon the antero-posterior arm at a point half an inch back of its middle, Horsley’s Later Cyrtometer. at an angle of 67°. The zero point of the scale on the antero-posterior arm is at the middle and is graduated in inches forward and backward. The lateral arm should be graduated for a distance of 3^ inches, which

In regard to the treatment of hydrophobia when the disease is actu- ally present, there have been more definite results from the woorara than from any other of the many agents which have been employed. But the general principles of therapeutics have not availed for any definite rule of treatment other than to seek a corrective for the disordered nerve-centres. It is evident that no inference should be drawn in favor of the efficacy of measures applied during the period of incubation, as there is no sufficient ground, in most instances, to believe that the disease would have been developed. In view of the great fatality of cases in which hydrophobia has actually appeared, and of the very limited bene- fits derived from medication of any kind, there is open to the profession a wide field for experimentation on the canine species, to ascertain what course of treatment may prove efficacious in staying the lethal tendency at the earliest stage of the disease. In like manner heroic remedies should be tested early in the human subject by scientific investigation.

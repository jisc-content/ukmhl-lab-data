Symptomatology.—The clinical course of pyaemia is characterized by the symptoms produced by the development of multiple metastatic abscesses, and by an intermittent fever, with intercurrent chills (Fig. FiS- V591- 1592). The atypical curve of fever is typical for pyaemia; its intermit- Fiff. 1590. Preparation from the Liver of a Soldier Dead with Pyaemia.

The beginning of pyaemia is usually accompanied by a severe chill, which may be repeated irregularly with more or less frequency, and has an inconstant duration; after each chill the temperature rises more or less quickly up to 104° F., or more, and may fall again just as quickly to the normal. This irregular course of the fever may be explained by the absorption into the system of micrococci and their poisonous prod- Fever-curve in Pj^oemia. ucts, from some focus of suppuration, which having been overcome, a normal temperature follows. The rapidity of the pulse follows the temperature more or less closely, with the exception that it always shows an inclination to stay rather frequent, even in the intervals of the fever. The general condition of the patient is typical of high fever, all the so-called typhoid symptoms being present, as they have been

495 TUBERCULOSIS OF BONES AND JOINTS. chloride of zinc,' balsam of Peru,2 and camphorated naplithol3 have all found their advocates for this use. The treatment cannot be called strictly a new one, because several of these substances have been in use for many years—as, for instance, tincture of iodine as introduced by Brainard, of Chicago—in chronic inflammation of the joints; but the persistent and extensive use of irritating and germicidal substances into the diseased tissue is strictly the outcome of late years. These various substances have found their respective advocates, as will be seen from the references given, but the majority of surgeons prefer the use of iodoform to that of any other drug.4 Although it has been shown in the laboratory that iodoform may not be a germicide, its anti-tubercular action is thoroughly recognized from a clinical standpoint, and experimentally it has been clearly proved that a pro- longed use of this article by subcutaneous injection in animals, pre- vents or at least retards the extension of tuberculosis. However that may be, the treatment of chronic tuberculosis of the bones and joints by the use of iodoform is a matter of very great importance, because it is not only supported by a great weight of surgical authority, but offers a reasonable ground for hoping that it may take the place under cer- tain restrictions of more radical operative measures. The iodoform is generally injected in sterilized glycerin or olive oil. A 10-per-cent, preparation is used, and it is said that not more than half a drachm of iodoform should be injected the first time, and in children less than this. It is stated by Semi that after its use in this manner the risk of iodoform intoxication is very slight, not a single case having been observed in 108 cases thus treated in the Tubingen Clinic and at Halle. The treatment has been very extensively used, as for instance by Bruns,6 who says6 that, in the last five years, of 100 cases of tubercular abscesses treated at his Clinic, 80 per cent, have been cured, and that in the last four years 50 cases of joint tuberculosis have also been cured. A 10 to 20 per cent, mixture of iodoform is used in pure glycerin or olive oil, prepared fresh and thoroughly sterilized. No pain or in- flammation follows the injection, although the temperature rises for a 1 Lanuelongue. 2 Munch, med. Woch., H. 40, 1888. Wiener med. Presse, Bd. xxx., H. 17-20, 1889.

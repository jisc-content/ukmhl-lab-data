(527 ) EXCISIONS AND RESECTIONS. BY JOHN ASIIHURST, Jr., M.D., BARTON PROFESSOR OF SURGERY AND PROFESSOR OF CLINICAL SURGERY IN THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA; SURGEON TO THE PENNSYLVANIA HOSPITAL, PHILADELPHIA. Since the publication of the article on excisions in the third volume of this work, my personal experience in this particular class of opera- tions has been more than trebled, and I have been led to modify some- what the conclusions then expressed. Thus as regards the contra-in- dications to excision, I have been encouraged to apply this conservative operation to cases of an acute character in which I formerly thought amputation preferable, and I have ventured, in the case of the knee at least, to extend the benefits of this procedure to patients of consider- ably more advanced age than I did in the earlier period of my practice. On the other hand, by the introduction of “ arthrectomy,” or “erasion,” as a mode of treating knee-joint disease, I have found that in selected cases a better limb can be secured than by resection, while by the adop- tion of Billroth’s suggestion to practise intra-articular and interstitial injections of iodoform suspended in glycerine (one part to ten), I have in a few instances, in which I should have formerly thought excision necessary, succeeded in obtaining a cure without resorting to an3r cut- ting operation whatever. Observance of the precautions of antiseptic surgery has diminished the immediate risks of excision, and has has- tened the healing of the external wound, but on the other hand has, I am satisfied, in some cases delayed bony union (which is wished for after knee-excisions), and has thus compelled the use after recovery of prosthetic apparatus, which otherwise would not have been required. I have in the following pages endeavored to summarize in tabular form the results of my increased experience with excision and resection in the several regions of the body, and venture to hope that the exposition will be of interest to the reader. Upper Jaw.—To the six cases of complete excision of the upper jaw referred to in the original article, I have added three more, the nine cases having given three deaths, only two of which, however, can be directly attributed to the operation. But besides these three deaths, it will be observed that in an equal number of cases recurrence of the disease for which the operation was performed took place within three months, so that the ultimate results of the procedure are not very encouraging. In view, however, of the hopeless character of the affections for which excision of the upper jaw

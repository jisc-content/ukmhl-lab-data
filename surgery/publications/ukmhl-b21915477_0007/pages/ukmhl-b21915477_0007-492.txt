INJURIES OF BONES. 432 is made that this man’s father, brother, and sister had each sustained fracture of the right patella. Richelot is quoted 1 as urging the importance of maintaining the tone and nutrition of the quadriceps muscle, rather than of bringing the fragments together, tie says that many persons with nearly four inches of separation can walk well, and go up and down stairs. I have myself, in cases under my care, found advantage in securing control of the quadriceps muscle by means of a sheet of rubber-plaster, closely applied at the lower half of the thigh, and with a crescentic edge exactly adapted to the upper margin of the patella, the fragments being first brought as nearly as possible together. Another long strip of rub- ber-plaster may be carried along down each side of the leg so as to hold the first in place. When my former article was written, the idea of exposing and sutur- ing the fractured patella had been suggested, and carried out in a few instances. But soon afterward, in a paper2 read before the Medical Society of London, Lister made an urgent plea for its general adoption; exhibiting six patients on whom he had successfully employed it. His views were freely discussed, and the propriety of such operations ques- tioned, by Holmes, Heath, Bryant, Morris, Sydney Jones, Gant, and Morrant Baker. Turner3 reported a case in which a man, aged 39, had his left patella broken in 1859; early in 1881 he fell, and the already stretched fibrous union yielded so that the separation was over 2^ inches. The frag- ments were then wired together, but suppuration ensued and the knee became stiff. In connection with this report there is an analysis of 50 cases of wiring of the patella; anchylosis, or at least a stiff knee, resulted in 8, and in 3 the issue was fatal. Abbe4 exhibited to the New York Surgical Society the patellae of a man aged 60, who some years ago had been operated on by wiring, by Dr. Markoe. Suppuration had occurred on both sides; bony union had been obtained, but with anchylosis of both knee-joints. Hardie6 reported four cases, in all of which the patients were able in four months to walk well and to bend the knees to 90°. He thought Lister’s operation “one of the finest examples of modern high-class surgery,” and advocated its adoption as the routine treatment. Against this view Davidson 6 cites the case of a man aged 40, in whom the suture of a patella fractured four months previously was followed by necrosis, suppuration, bedsores, and death. Favorable results have been recorded by Page,7 Ceci,8 Lammiman,’ Pickering,10 Rockwell,11 and Wight.12 The last-named surgeon gives four cases, and expresses his confidence that this procedure will become the established practice. He thinks only one suture necessary, and that the best time for applying it is between the tenth and the fif- teenth days.

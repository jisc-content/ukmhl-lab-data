325 TREATMENT OF SYPHILIS. the retro-trochanterian fossa is said to be also a convenient locality. The arms and legs are to be avoided. 7. After the needle has been plunged into the tissues, a momentâ€™s pause may be made to ascertain if a blood-vessel has been wounded. If a drop of blood appears, the injection should not be proceeded with. If not. the syringe may be attached, and from fifteen to twenty drops of the fluid may then be very slowly thrown in. 8. If numerous injections are to be made, they should be spaced at intervals of at least an inch. Soluble salts of mercury are usually employed for hypodermic injec- tion, and of these the bichloride is that most commonly used. Lewin's formula, which I prefer, is essentially as follows: g Hydrarg. chlor. corrosiv., ...... gr. viij. Sodii chloridi., ........ gr. xv. Aquae destillat., f 3 iij. M. Fifteen minims of this solution represents about one-twelfth of a grain of the bichloride of mercury. French syphilologists prefer the preparation known as the peptonate of mercury.1 1 For further details regarding the various salts of mercury, see Fournier, op. cit., and L. Wolff, Proceedings Phila.

436 INJURIES OF BONES. corded by Albec 1 and by Clark,2 who refers to sixteen other published cases. Instances of non-union in early life have been reported by Bradford3 and by Parker.4 In the latter case, after nearly three years of treat- ment, amputation was performed. I myself saw at the Pennsylvania Hospital, in 1889, a girl only 13 months old, with pseud arthrosis of both bones about an inch and a half above the ankle; the mother stated that the child had in some way been caught under a street-car about six weeks before; there was a small sinus probably communicating with the false joint. The mother was anxious that I should operate at once, became impatient because I wanted to get the child in better condition, and took her away. Berger5 saw a man aged 57, who when nine months old had a fracture of the bones of the leg, with pseud arthrosis, and failure of development of the limb; there was a regular capsular ligament connecting the fragments, lined by synovial membrane. The skin over the toes was anaesthetic and congested. A curious idea is said 6 to have been carried out with success by Hahn, in an ununited fracture of the tibia. He cut through the fibula, and implanted its lower portion into the upper fragment of the tibia. It is stated that “there was scarcely any movement of the lower fragment of the tibia.” Padieu7 relates the case of a woman who sustained a fracture of both bones of the leg, just after becoming pregnant; union failed to occur until after her confinement, when it began at once, and in a month was complete. Mere deformity sometimes calls for operative interference. I have myself chiselled away a wedge from the tibia, united at an angle salient inward, in a boy aged 15, with good result. Jones,8 in the case of a boy aged 16, who eleven years before had sustained a Pott’s fracture, excised the inner malleolus and upper surface of the astragalus, cor- rected the deformity, and effected a cure with a movable joint. In a case reported by Ashhurst,9 an enormous mass of callus formed at the seat of fracture, both bones of the leg having been involved, and caused bowing outward, with excessive pain from pressure upon the nerve; removal of the callus was effected, with a good ultimate result. Fractures of the upper part of the fibula have been observed by Weir,10 by Marchant,11 by McCosh,12 and by Chapin 13 (in a boy only 6 years old). In one of McCosh’s cases, in Weir’s and in several instances cited by him, and in Chapin’s, the bone gave way to muscular force. In Weir's, Marchant’s, and several others, the external peroneal nerve was damaged, pinched between the fragments, or stretched by exuberant callus. The symptoms so produced have been discussed by Blin and Damaye,14 in connection with a case in which paralytic anaesthesia was 1 Transactions of Maine Med. Association, 1886. 2 Glasgow Med.

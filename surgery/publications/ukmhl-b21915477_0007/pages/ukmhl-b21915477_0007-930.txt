HERNIA. 870 Umbilical Hernia.—Umbilical hernia is either congenital or ac- quired. It exists not infrequently at birth, in both sexes, on account of the patulous condition of the ornphalo-mesenteric duct. In this variety the only covering of Fig. 1724. the tumor is the sheath of the umbilical cord. In the acquired form, the intestine escapes either directly through the navel or more fre- quently to one side of this contraction. The sac of an acquired umbilical hernia is composed of the parie- tal layer of the perito- neum, and the outer covering of integument and subcutaneous fat. into the scrotum and pass beyond the level of the testicle, it never lies in con- tact with it, as in the case of congenital oblique inguinal hernia. In general, therefore, we may say. that an ingui- nal hernia is congenital or acquired, the congenital form existing at birth while the acquired hernia is one which comes on after birth, and is caused chiefly by the pressure of the intestine or omentum from gravity and muscu- lar effort combined. Fig. 1723. Femoral Hernia.—This is always an acquired hernia. The tumor enters the femoral or crural canal beneath Poupart’s ligament, just to the inner side of the iliac and femoral vein. (Fig. 1724.) If it remains in the crural sheath, it is an incomplete, but if it protrudes at the saphenous opening, it is a complete femoral hernia. Infantile Inguinal Hernia. Femoral Hernia, Showing Relation to Femoral Vein. Ventral Hernia.— This may also be con- genital or acquired. The protrusion may occur at birth, as a re- sult of failure of de- velopment in the mus- cles of the abdomen. It is usually met with

151 DIAGNOSIS. Although this disease occurs most frequently in the families of the destitute and poorly fed, nevertheless children of well-to-do families occasionally suffer from it, even in an aggravated form, in consequence, I think, usually of ignorance on the part of parents in regard to the dietetic requirements of young children. Merei, in his treatise on the Disorders of Infantile Development (London, 1850), says that in Manchester, where his observations were made, one child in every five in comfortable circumstances presented rachitic symptoms. In the United States rachitis is rare in well-to-do families, and when it does oc- cur, it can usually, as we shall see hereafter, be traced to dietetic errors. Diagnosis.—In preparing statistics relating to rachitis it is obviously important that the diagnosis of mild and incipient cases should be clear and unmistakable. What symptoms and anatomical characters indicate rickets? The fact that an infant has reached the ninth month with- out a tooth, is regarded by Sir William Jenuer as a reliable sign of rachitis. In order to determine to what extent dentition is retarded by rickets, and to what extent retarded dentition may be considered a sign of that disease, Dr. H. R. Purdy, Physician to the Outdoor Department of Bellevue Hospital, has made the following observations:— Table I.—Shotting at what age 200 infants showing no signs of rachitis cut the first tooth. Cases consecutive. 3 cut first tootli at 2 months. 28 cut first tooth at 8 months. 14 “ “ tt “ 3 ii 20 “ “ t it 9 “ 16 “ “ tt tt 4 it 14 “ “ t tt 10 “ 20 “ “ tt u 5 “ 15 “ “ t tt 11 “ 24 “ “ tt it 6 “ 8 “ “ t tt 12 “ 37 “ “ it it 7 li 1 “ “ t tt 13 “ Of these infants 132 were wet-nursed ; 68 bottle-fed. Table II.—Showing at what age jS infants exhibiting one or mare rachitic symptoms cut the first tooth. Cases consecutive. 2 cut first tooth at 4 months. 7 cut first tootli at 11 months. O tt tt “ “ 5 tt 5 “ “ tt “ 12 3 “ ’4 “ “ 6 tt 6 “ “ tt “ 13 2 “ “ “ “ 7 “ 3 “ “ “ “ 14 5 44 44 “ “ 8 tt 1 « « tt “ 16 6 “ “ “ “ 9 tt 1 “ “ “ 18 Table III. — Thirty infants without teeth and with pronounced rachitic symptoms. In all these cases the rachitic rosary, enlarged subcutaneous veins, profuse perspirations, abnormal distention, and enlarged joints, were present. Bottle-fed, 21; wet-nursed, 9. 6 aged 7 months. 10 “ 8 “ 1 “ 9 1 aged 10 months. 4 “ 11 3 “ 12 “ 2 aged 13'months, 2 “ 14 1 “ 15 It is evident from these interesting statistics that dentition delayed until the ninth or even the tenth or eleventh month is not a certain sign of rachitis, but slow teething is common in the rachitic, and there- fore aids in the diagnosis. It is one of the diagnostic signs. In order to determine whether rachitis, incipient or of a mild form, be present, all the signs which characterize it should be considered—the fretfulness, free perspirations upon the head, neck, face, and chest, the tenderness of surface, anaemia, and general deterioration of health, de- layed dentition, swelling of the joints, craniotabes, bending of the long bones, rachitic rosary, misshapen head, prominent frontal and parietal

FRACTURES OF THE HUMERUS. 419 Detachment of this epiphysis has sometimes been followed by failure of development of the bone. Such cases have been recorded by Bruns,1 by Bryant,2 and by Shearar.3 As to the treatment of ordinary cases, enough has already been said. Besides the operations above referred to, Helferich,4 in a successful case shown to the Society of German Surgeons, cut down upon the fracture, reduced the displacement, and secured the fragments by passing through them a long steel pin, which was left in place for two weeks. Bruns stated that in two instances he had excised the detached epiphy- sis, and Wolfler had had one like experience. Todd 6 reports a case in which an old woman who had fallen down a flight of stairs, was thought to have sustained a fracture of the ana- tomical neck of each humerus. In another case, recorded by Croft,6 a man aged 33 fell about eighteen feet, breaking the neck of the bone, and displacing its head into the axilla, whence it was excised; the re- sult is said to have been better than might have been expected. Poi- rier 7 has reported another instance. Glutton “ relates that in the case of a boy aged 13, with subclavicular dislocation and fracture of .the surgical neck of the humerus, reduction was accomplished by incision and direct pressure, after which an ivory peg was driven through both fragments. Recovery ensued, with perfect movements of the joint. A specimen was shown by Little9 to the Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland, in which the greater tuberosity of the humerus was detached, the head of the bone being luxated. In a case reported by Fenwick 10 a woman aged 41 was struck by a falling timber, and had a fracture of the surgical neck of the humerus, with a wound of the brachial artery; the vessel was exposed and tied above and below, with success, the radial pulse returning in less than forty-eight hours. A less fortunate result is recorded by Angerer.11 A woman, aged 32, fell down-stairs, landing on her face, with her left arm adducted and flexed across her chest. Sensation and motion were at once lost, and there was great pain in the shoulder. Gangrene of the limb ensued; disarticulation at the shoulder was performed, and it was found that there was a V-shaped fracture of the surgical neck of the humerus, the radial (musculo-spiral) nerve being torn off, and the other nerves and the vessels strongly compressed by the shaft-end driven up beneath the pectoral muscle. Powell12 saw in a child four days old a fracture at the middle of the arm, due to rough handling on the part of a nurse. Stamforth 13 is reported to have shown to the Sheffield Medico-Chirur- gical Society a girl 21 years of age, in whom atrophy of the deltoid, supra-spinatus, infra-spinatus, biceps and bracbialis anticus, was ascribed to “a green-stick fracture of the humerus over nineteen years previously.” 1 Archiv fur klinische Chirurgie, 1882. 2 Manual for the Practice of Surgery, 4tli ed., 1885, p. 877. 3 British Medical Journal, Oct. 10, 1885. 4 La Semaine Medicale, 11 Avril, 1888. 5 Med. and Surg.

(313) VENEREAL DISEASES: THE SIMPLE VENEREAL ULCER OR CHANCROID. F. R. STURGIS, M.D., OF NEW YORK. Varieties of Chancroid. Dr. Fernand Lavergne, in the Annales cle Dermatologie et Syphili- graphie for 1883, calls attention to a variety of the simple venereal ulcer which he has styled the papular chancroid. Its peculiarity con- sists in being slightly elevated instead of depressed beneath the tissues, and it closely resembles a syphilitic papule. The diagnosis is based in part on the coexistence upon the same subject of other varieties of chancroid, and it is found in both men and women. Lavergne calls at- tention to the fact that in the museum of the St. Louis Hospital there is a specimen of simple papular chancroid of the vulva. Inoculability of the Chancroid and of Chancroidal Buboes. At the International Congress of Dermatology and Syphilography, held in Paris in 1889, Ducrey read a paper in which he arrived at the following conclusions:â€” 1. That the chancroid is possessed of a specific and definite poison; 2. That this virus has not yet been artificially cultivated, although it has been produced by inoculation in man; it corresponds with a micro- organism which has not yet been artificially developed in the usual nu- tritive materials; and 3. That this micro-organism, which up to the present time has been regarded as the cause of the chancroid, and which is not easy to cul- tivate, appears not to be identical with the microbe which is the real cause of the chancroid. For some time very little was heard about this question of the microbe, until Welander published in the Archiv fur Dermatologie und Syplii- lographie, 1889, a paper in which he claimed to have found the bacilli in the pustules of inoculation, though they were not found in all speci- mens, and when present were present in very small quantities, whence he did not regard them as of great pathological importance. In 1891, Krefting, in the Nordiskt Medicinskt Arkiv, published the result of a

MortalityThe later writers regard the danger of complete extirpa- tion, with dissection of the axilla, as trivial. This great improvement in results is probably due to the aseptic methods now in use, by which the risks of infection are reduced to a minimum, and by which the patient is saved the danger of systemic poisoning from absorption of antiseptic chemicals. According to Dennis the death-rate is three-fold greater after the complete operation than after the incomplete. These figures include all pre-aseptic cases. In 71 operations by Dennis there was but one death, and that resulting from haemophilia. Butlin thinks that the completed operation doubles the mortality. Permanent Cures.—Gross believed that cancer began as a local af- fection, and that early and thorough excision prolonged life and encour- aged the hope of permanent cure. Most writers agree with him. Accepting the three-year period of immunity as the standard by which permanent recoveries are to be judged, the operation up to 1888 definitively cured 11.83 per cent, of cases. In 45 cases of his own, Gross reported 22.5 per cent, of recoveries. Dennis takes a more favorable view, and gives a percentage of 25 cures in his own experi- ence. Schmidt1 has had permanent recovery in 21.5 per cent.; under a two-year limit 26.4 per cent. In Gross’s first series of 100 cases there was not a single permanent recovery.2 Weir, reporting 20 per cent, cured in 60 traced cases, deems the results of thorough operation encouraging. Terrillon 3 observed no cures in 48 cases of carcinoma with axillary infection. He regards this complication, therefore, as ’■ Deutsch. Ztschr. f. Cliir., 1887, Bd. xxvi., S. 139. 5 Med.

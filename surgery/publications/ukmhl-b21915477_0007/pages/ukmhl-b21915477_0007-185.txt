129 HYDROPHOBIA. shown conclusively before, in the experiments upon dogs, but there was no positive assurance of a like result being secured in its application to a human being, until this courageous young man voluntarily submitted himself to the test. With the lights thrown upon the matter by the diverse influence of inoculation upon the monkey and the rabbit, Pas- teur was not in a position to guarantee complete exemption from risk, in employing even greatly attenuated rabic virus for inoculation of man. With the boldness growing out of his previous scientific in- vestigation the great savant essayed to explore an unknown field, and fortunately his experiment proved a success. In a lecture upon hydrophobia to the students at the Southern Medical College, Atlanta, Ga., on November 10, 1884, I referred to the preventive inoculations of Pasteur upon dogs, and used the following language touching its extension to mankind:— “A young German student has offered himself as the first human subject, and will hand his name down to posterity as a martyr, or will live to enjoy the plaudits of mankind. . . . Say not that it is pride or vainglory which leads a young man to risk his life in a cause like this; hut give him credit for the purest and noblest impulses which can actuate man’s conduct in this world.” I have now only to add, that Joseph Meister is entitled to a monument more lasting than brass or stone. The inoculations have only been generally performed since the begin- ning of 1886. The number of persons inoculated from that time until July, 1888, at the Pasteur Institute, at Paris, was 5374. Excluding the deaths of those who developed rabies before the treatment was completed, because the nervous centres were involved before the treat- ment began, the total mortality for 1886 was 0.93 per cent.; for 1887, 0.67 per cent.; for 1888, 0.55 per cent. The gradual perfecting of the method since has been attended with a corresponding decrease of mor- tality in the succeeding years. It was stated by M. Pasteur in 1890, that among the last thousand bitten by rabid animals and inoculated by the intensive method, in his Institute, not a single death had resulted, and that there had not occurred any unsuccessful case under this treatment. The following table from The New York Therapeutic Review, of September, 1893, kindly sent me by the editor, Dr. Paul Gibier, shows the results up to that year:— Years. Persons Treated. Died. Death Rate, per cent. 1886 2671 25 0.94 1887 1770 14 0.79 1888 1622 9 0.55 1889 1830 7 0.38 1890 1540 5 0.32 1891 1559 4 0.25 1892 1790 4 0.22 The great majority of those who have been treated at the Paris In- stitute had been bitten by dogs, which had been examined by veterinary surgeons and recognized as rabid, or in which hydrophobia had been evi- denced by inoculations on small animals, or by the death of some other person or animals bitten by them. It will be noted that the mortality has steadily lessened, and it is con- VOL. VII.—9

PREFACE. The object of this Supplementary Volume is to furnish to the readers of the International Encyclopedia of Surgery a brief but sufficient account of such additions to both Surgical Science and Surgical Art as have been brought forward during the seven years which have elapsed since the revised edition of the original book was published, and as have seemed of sufficient importance to justify their incorporation in a work of this character, which makes no claim to be an ephemeris of theoretic novelties, but rather to be a trustworthy digest of accepted and estab- lished facts. In carrying out the intention to make the volume a Supplement to its predecessors, the authors of the several articles have had constantly in mind the necessity of not unnecessarily repeating what is already in the possession of the reader; and very variable amounts of space have therefore been occupied in the consideration of the several subjects dis- cussed. Some topics were so elaborately presented in the earlier por- tions of the work that, in the absence of any great quantity of new material, they have in the present volume been summarily dealt with; while as regards other subjects the activity of surgeons and surgical writers has been so intense that in some instances more space has been required for the supplementary record than seven years ago was needed for the original article. As an example may be mentioned the subject of Cerebral Surgery, which may almost be said-to have come into exist- ence since the revised edition of the Encj'clopaedia was published. As with the previous volumes, the editor is responsible for the general arrangement of the work, for those articles, three in number, which bear his own name, and for a very few notes which may be distinguished by their inclusion within brackets [thus]; but for the facts and opinions ( Y )

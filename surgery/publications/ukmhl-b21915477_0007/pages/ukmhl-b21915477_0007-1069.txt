THE PROGRESS OF THE CESAREAN AND PORRO-CiESAREAN OPERA- TIONS AND THE REVIVAL OF The CLesarean Operation; Puerperal Ccelio-Hysterotomy. This operation has in a very remarkable degree demonstrated, dur- ing the past seven years, and especially in Leipsic, Dresden, Vienna, and Glasgow, the fact that it is capable of being made one of a very minimum measure of fatality to both mothers and children, when per- formed early in labor, or before it, and with all the precautions which experience has shown are essential to success, in avoiding peritonitis, hiemorrhage, septic infection, and nerve-shock. Those who have most carefully studied the whole history of the operation have much less fear of its result in death than the general practitioner, who, as a rule, is strongly prejudiced against it, and only helps, by his fears, to produce the greatest element of danger, viz.: a delay in the use of the knife. Had the operators of our country entire control, from the onset of labor, of every parturient woman whose case is such as to render a Caesarean section a possible necessity, and could they also command consent of the patient and her family to the use of the knife at the proper moment, we should, in time, produce a record far more to our credit than the one which we now have, and which, as a careful collec- tor of cases, I have recently been led to feel is, in a measure, almost a disgrace; not to the operators, as a rule, but to those having the early conduct of the labors. Could the dangerous element of fear of the op- eration be changed into a fear of the consequences of delay in operat- ing, we should soon be able to present for the United States a much more creditable record of results. So intimately is the prognosis of any given case connected with its history prior to the operation, that we are able to state with considera- ble accuracy what has been the result to the mother, when we learn vol. vii.â€”64 (1009 ) BY ROBERT P.

VOL. vii.—1 (1) THE INTERNATIONAL ENCYCLOPAEDIA OF SURGERY. INFLAMMATION. BY HAROLD C. ERNST, A.M., M.D., ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF BACTERIOLOGY IN HARVARD UNIVERSITY; PHYSICIAN TO OUT-PATIENTS AT THE MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL, ETC. Both the pathology of inflammation and its clinical aspects have been so fully treated of in the two articles already devoted to these sub- jects in the first volume of this work, that a reconsideration of the topics there discussed at length would he an undesirable filling of space to no good end. There remains to speak of the recent advances in the knowledge of the subject, which seem likely to revolutionize at least a part of the theories held in regard to the changes seen, and which have not been fully touched upon in the articles spoken of. These advances lie in the increase of our observations upon the etiol- ogy of the processes commonly grouped under the heading of inflam- mation, and depend largely and especially upon the work of one indi- vidual. whose researches are as epoch-making as those of Virchow or of Colmheim. The researches spoken of are those of Metclmikoff and his followers, and these, taken together with the general increase of knowledge of etiology in the last few years, enable a new point of view to be taken in regard to inflammation, which it now seems necessary to look upon as a symptom of some disturbance of the tissues, and not in any sense as a disease by itself. This is the-position that will be taken in regard to it—that it is a symptom of irritation of some sort—and this being well understood, the keynote of what follows will easily he found. The recent advances in our knowledge of bacteria have completely changed our ideas in regard to the process. Up to the time of these advances, it had been taught that inflammation was the result of a local irritant, producing an excessive flowing of blood to the part, with

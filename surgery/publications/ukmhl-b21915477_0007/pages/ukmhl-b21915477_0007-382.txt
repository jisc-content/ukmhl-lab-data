322 VENEREAL DISEASES: SYPHILIS. Relative Frequency of Chancre in Different Localities.—The following figures may be compared with those given in Vol. II., pages 354, 355, 358:— Seat of Genital and Extra-Genital Chancres. 140 39 15 17 16 15 4 22 2 5 1 9 1 1 2 3 292 occupied the posterior cul-de-sac; another, the right cul-de-sac; a third was situated behind the vulvo-vaginal ring on the posterior wall of the vagina; the fourth at the junction of the posterior and middle thirds. The vaginal chancre is painless and excites no functional disturbance. The accompanying adenopathy occupies the groins when the chancre is in the lower third of the vagina, and the smaller pelvic basin when it is in the other two-thirds. The vaginal chancre heals spontaneously in one or two weeks, according to Gardillon, but the period is probably computed from the moment that the lesion has reached its maximum development. The diagnosis of chancre of the vagina is not difficult, if the lesion is attentively studied. The chancroid of the vagina, which, like the chancre, runs a rapid course and heals spontaneously, is generally mul- tiple, non-indurated, and presents the appearance of a true ulcer, with sharply cut edges and uneven base, secreting an abundance of pus; it may be inoculated upon its bearer, and is usually accompanied by vul- var chancroids of a similar appearance. Vaginal chancres must be dis- tinguished from herpetic erosions, and from ulcerative or erosive syphi- lodermata, chiefly by the history of their development.4 Diagnosis of Chancre.—Leloir says that when an herpetic ulcer is pressed between the fingers, a drop of serous fluid is squeezed out. This manipulation can be repeated several times with the same effect. In the case of chancre, on the contrary, a little fluid is seen on the sur- face, but the quantity is not increased by pressure.

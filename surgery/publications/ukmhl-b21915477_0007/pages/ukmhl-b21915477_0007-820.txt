INJURIES AND DISEASES OF THE NECK. 760 Carcinoma of Neck. develop by preference in males between fifty and sixty. These cervical carcinomata first ap- pear between the hyoid bone and larynx on the one hand and the vascular trunks on the other, often as tumors of stony hardness. Even when the growth has attained large di- mensions, the integument and pharyngeal wall can be freely moved over its surface. A section from the tumor is at this time like that from a can- cerous mamma. When retro- grade changes and the soften- ing incident thereto have oc- curred, the tumor may be converted into an irregular fluctuating mass of large di- mensions, widely separating the air-passages from the blood-vessels and extending, as in the first of Volkmann's cases, quite to the base of tbe skull. Figs. 1716 and 1717 are from drawings made by Dr. De Beck of a case operated on in 1884 at the Good Samaritan Hospital, in which more than an inch of the inter- nal jugular vein was removed. The patient succumbed to recurrence eight months after the operation. Microscopic examination revealed the epithelial character of the growth. The stroma consisted of firm fibrous bands. In the three cases reported by Volkmann, death from secondary hemorrhage followed soon after the operation. The secondary carcinomata of the neck are the result of direct in- fection from primary dis- ease of the lips, tongue, fauces, air - passages, or mamma. The predilection of this disease for the region of the oral cavity explains the greater frequency of carcinoma of the neck in the submaxillary triangle. The lymphatic glands are first involved. For a time they appear as distinct tu- mors, freely movable on each other and without at- tachments. Afterward a peri-adenitis ensues, prob- ably from added purulent Carcinoma of Neck. infection.

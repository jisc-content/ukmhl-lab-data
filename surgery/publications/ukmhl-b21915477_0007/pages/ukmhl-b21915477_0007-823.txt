Fig. 1718. CYSTS OF THE NECK. 763 Branchial Cysts. appear translucent (hydrocele of the neck). The cysts illustrated in Fig. 1718 contained a clear watery fluid, a few flat epithelial cells, cholesterin crystals, and a trace of albumin. Anatomically these cysts are benign, hut cases have been recorded in which, from proliferation of the glandular element of the cyst-wall, a malignant element has been added. Samter3 recently reported a case of this nature in which local recurrence and metastases in the abdomen caused death. Hemorrhage into a serous branchial cyst not infrequently occurs, 1 Buttersack, Virchow’s Archiv, Bd. cvi., S. 206. 2 Malherbe, Bull, de la Soc.

Teeth are rarely found. In a number of cases the cyst has been found to be a true teratoma containing hair, teeth, and irregular masses of bone or cartilage, while in other cases isolated masses of cartilage have been found.1 When the cyst has for a long time remained latent, its contents may become oleaginous.2 In the serous cysts they may be perfectly limpid, and, the cyst-wall ordinarily being very thin, the tumor may

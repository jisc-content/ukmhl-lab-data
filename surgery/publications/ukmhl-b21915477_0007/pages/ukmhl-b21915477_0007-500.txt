(Quain.) bv, Blood-vessel; p, subperiosteal (intramembranous) layer encroaching on cartilaginous end; of, osteogenic fibres; pf, interlacing fibres; c, groups of cartilage-cells; ic, bone formed in car- tilage; im, bone formed in membrane. pleted bone tissue takes place from centres of ossification and proceeds until the full stage of development is reached. A typical bone is made up of a covering which is called periosteum, a compact layer, and a cancellated layer, which is in part occupied by a cavity, called the medul- lary cavity, for the lodgment of the medulla (marrow). When one bone is connected movably with another, the two exhibit modifications of form and arrangement of their several parts, which supply the conditions neces- sary to the formation of a joint. This portion of a bone is called its articulating por- tion ; and the fibrous capsule which surrounds a joint may be regarded as a modification of the periosteum, to which it is attached, and with which it blends at its points of insertion into the bone. An example of the appear- ance of a bone exhibiting at an early stage of develop- ment all the peculiarities just mentioned, may be seen in Fig. 1612, taken from Quain’s Anatomy. The flat bones differ from all the other bones in having no movable joint surfaces when they are fully devel- oped; and they contain no true medullary cavity, al- though their cancellated structure—as, for example, in the body of the sphenoid, in the scapula, and in the ilium—may occupy a consid- erable part of the bone and make it relatively porous and light. A peculiar expansion of the bone substance is found

INJURIES AND DISEASES OF THE URETHRA. 966 the patient should, during the stage of chill, be warmly wrapped in blankets and surrounded with hot water-cans. Of the remedies recommended for the relief of urinary fever, those which have, perhaps, found most favor are quinine in liberal doses, and the tincture of aconite, the latter being given in two-minim doses, and its effect watched. In cases where the secretion is diminished, or even sup- pressed, resort may be had to the vapor bath, dry cupping of the loins, the hypodermic injection of pilocarpine, or the administration of the in- fusion of digitalis, as recommended by Gouley, in drachm doses every hour or two, its action on the circulation being carefully noted. Mr. Henry Morris speaks highly of hypodermic injections of atropine com- bined with morphine in these cases. The internal antiseptics already named should he exhibited in con- junction with whatever remedies are used during the attack.

427 FRACTURES OF TIIE FEMUR. “ 4. The length of the limb is either exactly equal to its fellow, or the amount of shortening falls within the limits found to exist in 90 per cent, of healthy limbs, viz., from one-eiglitli to one inch. “ 5. Lameness, if present, is not due to more than one inch of short- ening. “ 6. The conditions attending the treatment prevent other results than those obtained.” Dr. Smith's paper, with the discussion upon it, and the full report of the committee, are well worthy of study. Thiriar is said 1 to have devised a combination of the starched band- age with extension by weight and pulley. He first applies one section of the bandage, with the extension, to the leg; a second section is then put on the thigh, overlapping the former in telescope-fashion. The thigh-part may be slit up so as to expose the limb, and when closed may be kept so by means of straps and buckles. Mention may perhaps be appropriately made here of a report by R. W. Parker2 of five cases of intentional fracture of the femur for the correction of deformities. Kennedy 3 reports the case of a man aged 38, who was carried down thirty feet in the wreck of a scaffolding, sustaining among other in- juries a comminuted fracture of the right femur at the upper part of its middle third. About two weeks afterward, the shortening amount- ing to three inches, an incision was made exposing the bone, when the lower fragment was found at the outer side of the upper, both, with some splinters, being embedded in a mass of callus. Resection was performed, and the ends wired together. Ten weeks later union was firm, and the patient could bear almost his entire weight upon the limb, which, however, was shortened two and three-quarter inches. An interesting case is recorded by Codings4 in w Inch a sailor aged 30 had had, fifteen months previously, a fracture of the shaft, badly united, with a shortening of six inches. By resection and subsequent extension the deformity was corrected, and union was obtained with only two inches of loss of length, and good use of the limb. Other instances have been reported by Heath 0 and Lorenz.6 In the latter case the frac- ture, in a boy aged 10 years, was situated in the upper third of the shaft, and had occurred five and one-half years previously. Union had taken place with an angle outward. By chiselling the fragments apart, and free division of muscles and tendons, a very good result was secured. Cases of non-union successfully treated by wiring have been recorded by Tobin,7 Robson,8 Owen,9 and Leeming.10 In two other cases, one re- ported by Jacobs 11 and the other by Treacy,12 the lesion was seated in the lower third of the bone, and in each the distal fragment was tilted down into the popliteal space by the gastrocnemius muscle. In each case, suturing of the ends with silver wire resulted in firm union, but with two inches of shortening of the limb.

130 HYDROPHOBIA. fidentlv expected that, with the improved technique and the observance of due precautions in every stage of the treatment with the intensive virus, the factor of fatality will he entirely eliminated from the Pas- teur Institute. The results of preventive inoculation agaiust hydrophobia in the Chi- cago Pasteur Institute since its inauguration, July 2, 1890, are given by Dr. A. Lagorio on November 18, 1893. To date, 302 persons have been treated, as follows: 104 bitten by animals recognized and ascertained to be rabid by the experimental proof, made in the laboratory, or by the death of other persons or animals bitten by the same animal; 126 bitten by animals recognized to be rabid by the symptoms of the dis- ease shown during life; 72 bitten by animals strongly suspected to be rabid; 2S2 persons were bitten by dogs, 7 by horses, 7 by cats, 3 by skunks, 2 by wolves, 1 by a mule. One death was reported among the patients treated, thus giving a mortality of only 0.33 per cent., corre- sponding very much to that for the same time at Paris. Of the persons treated, 185 came from Illinois, 32 from Iowa, 23 from Indiana, 21 from Kansas, 9 from Ohio, 5 from Missouri, 5 from Arizona, 4 from Minnesota, 4 from Michigan, 4 from Louisiana, 3 from Tennessee, 3 from Kentucky, 2 from Texas, 1 from Wisconsin, and 1 from South Dakota. The following table contains similar information with regard to the work of Dr. Paul Gibier at the New York Pasteur Institute for the year 1892, this being the third year of its operation:— Statistics of Treatment.

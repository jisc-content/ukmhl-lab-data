ANESTHETIC SUBSTANCES. 185 Hypnotism.—The following operations have been reported as having been performed during hypnosis: Amputation of the breast, by Cloquet, in 1829; amputation of the leg, by Loysel, in 1844; of the arm, by Joly, in 1845; of the thigh, by Guerineau, in 1859.’ More recently Mesnet2 has performed anterior colporrhapliy during hypnosis, and Roth has reduced a dislocation of the humerus;3 Hafftner is reported4 to frequently produce this state by holding the mask before the pa- tient's face, and soothingly directing him to go to sleep. Anesthetic Substances. Trimethylethylene—C5Hiu—-Pental.— This is an impure amylene,5 the use of which has been revived within the past two years. Giirlt records 210 administrations with 1 death, while Hollaender0 reports 900 narcoses by its means for minor operations with no fatality. While re- garding it as the best anaesthetic for short operations, he admits the occurrence of dangerous symptoms, and does not produce any evidence to show its superiority over older and safer anaesthetics. Wood and Oerna,7 and Chalab,8 consider it very dangerous. Dichloromethane—Methylenic Chloride, Methylene Bichloride.— Favorable reports are occasionally received of the use of this agent. Trelat9 declares that the methyl chloride of Sir Spencer Wells is a mix- ture of chloroform and methylic alcohol, 4 to 1, and that it does not decompose by exposure to air or light. Used by means of a spray, methylene chloride produces local anaesthesia, which is probably due to freezing of the part by rapid evaporation.10 The danger of sloughing may be prevented, according to Bardet,1 11 111 by painting the surface with glycerin. Chloral amide—C,.H602N.—This is a colorless, crystalline, and slight- ly bitter substance, with a melting point of 115° C. (239° F.). It is a compound formed by the addition of formamide to anhydrate of chloral. It is soluble in 9 parts of water and li parts of alcohol, and does not decompose in either solution. Its action is similar to that of chloral, being a cerebral and spinal depressant, but it does not so considerably depress the circulation. In addition to being a potent hypnotic, it is credited with being an efficient analgesic. It is administered in from ten-grain to thirty-grain doses, and the resulting sleep usually lasts from five to eight hours. Paraldehyde—C„H40.—This is a colorless liquid, having a disagree- able odor and burning taste, with a boiling point of 124° C. (255° F.), and a sp. gr. of 0.998. It is readily soluble in cold water and alcohol. It acts as a nerve sedative, and is principally used as an hypnotic and 1 Practitioner, 1889. 2 Bulletin de l’Acad. de Med. de Paris, 1889 ; Practitioner, 1889. 3 Provincial Med.

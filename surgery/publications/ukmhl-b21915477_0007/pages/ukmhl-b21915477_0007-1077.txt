(1017) INJURIES AND DISEASES OF THE FEMALE GENITALS. BY THEOPHILUS PARVIN, M.D., LL.D., PROFESSOR OF OBSTETRICS AND DISEASES OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN THE JEFFERSON MEDICAL COLLEGE, PHILADELPHIA. In these pages will first be presented some operations for restoration of the perineum and for colporrhaphia, which were not given in my former article; perineotomy in the female will also be briefly described. The methods of operating for ruptured perineum are in recent years very many, at least in name, but I shall consider only Tait’s, Winck- el’s, Martin’s, and Sanger’s. Lawson Tait’s Operation for Partial Rupture of the Perineum. the lower limbs are held Fig. 1761. Perineum. (Macnaughton Jones.) The patient—rectum and bladder having been recently emptied lies upon her back, is anaesthetized, and strongly flexed upon the abdomen; it is well to have an antiseptic plug of cotton, with string attached to it, passed into the rectum. The operator has from three to five silkworm-gut sutures, a strong, curved needle with handle, and a pair of short, thick scissors, the blades of which make an obtuse angle with the handles. Two assistants, with thumb or index finger, one on each side, render the tissues tense at a point correspond- ing with a median transverse line crossing the perineum between the anal and vulval openings. The operator introduces the index and the medius into the lower portion of the rectum, and then thrusts one point of the scissors through the skin thus stretched, cutting the tissues from side to side: the incision is about three-eighths of an inch deep, and a rectal and a vaginal flap are thus formed. Next two incisions are made, each a third of an inch long, posteriorly and obliquely from each end of the transverse cut; similar incisions are made anteriorly, an inch in length, into the tissue of each labium.

Sometimes the brain substance enclosing the fluid is reduced to a very thin film. Treatment.—Until very recently the treatment of these conditions has consisted practically in electrolysis, pressure, or the injection of Morton’s fluid; but the success of operations on the brain lias led re- cently to a number of attempts to cure them by operative measures. In the “Annual of the Universal Medical Sciences” for 1889,1 four cases of meningocele are collected, with one death. Mazzucchelli2 reports an- other successful case, and Lea 3 reports two more—one of meningocele as large as a walnut (Fig. 1692), operated on at six weeks of age, the other of encephalocele operated on at eight months of age, after the Fig. 1692. Fig. 1693. Excision of a Meningocele. (Lea.) Excision of an Encephalocele Containing Part of the Cerebellum. (Lea.) failure of Morton’s fluid. The tumor (Fig. 1693) was as large as a hen’s egg, and on examination a large part of the cerebellum was found to have been removed. The patient’s temperature rose to 101° F., with vomit- ing and twitching of the arms, but by the third day became normal, and primary union was obtained. At the end of three weeks, however, hydrocephalus was beginning. I have myself reported a case 4 of menin- gocele in which recovery was uninterrupted. Powell5 narrates a case of encephalocele about the size of a tennis ball which he mistook for a sebaceous cyst. During the excision, when pulling on the presumed sac, violent spasms of the right arm and leg drew his attention to the real condition. Removal of the tumor was followed by recovery with out paralysis. Berger 0 has referred to a large number of cases re- corded by Perrier, Jessup, Marshall, Picque, and others. Cabot7 also reports a case of recovery after operation. Horsley and Marshall have reported deaths. Even hydrencephalocele, which is as a rule entirely unamenable to treatment, has been operated on at least three times with success: first, by Picque,8 who operated on a child Id days old, the tumor being as large as a child’s head, and portions of the cerebrum and cerebellum being removed ; secondly, b}r Fagen,9 who removed a tumor as large as as medium-sized orange three weeks after birth, when gangrene of the tumor had set in, tying the pedicle with four strong catgut ligatures 1 Vol. iii., A, 53. 2 Annals of Surg., 1892, vol. xv., p. 79. 3 Brit.

INJURIES OF BONES. 416 Fractures of the Scapula. Two additional cases in which this lesion was due to muscular action have been reported: one by Dobson,1 and the other by Leidy.2 * R. W. Parker " has recorded three cases affecting the neck of the bone, two in men aged 55 and 68 respectively, and one in a woman aged 44; in another case, that of a man aged 24, the injury appeared to be a contusion merely, followed by wasting of the neighboring mus- cles, but the diagnosis was at first obscure. Another instance, in which the injury at first seemed to be a luxation of the humerus, has been re- ported by Hemenway.4 I had myself in 1S87, at the Pennsylvania Hospital, a boy said to he two years old, but very large for that age, who had fallen out of a third-story window, sustaining a fracture in the shoulder-joint, proba- bly through the glenoid cavity; the crepitus was very distinct, but could not be certainly located. On the sixteenth day all trace of the injury had disappeared. In a case reported by S. C. Smith,5 a man aged 35 sustained by a crushing force a fracture of the scapula and upper three ribs on the left side, with rupture of the subclavian artery and vein; death ensued in sixteen hours, from shock. Robson 6 saw a miner, aged 31, who had had a fracture of the scapula by direct violence; there was a gap of an inch between the two portions of the spine near the root of the acromion, and the muscles were wasted. The fragments were exposed, freshened, and wired together, and five months afterward the strength and movements of the part were com- pletely restored. Cases of fracture of the coracoid process have been reported by Huse,7 * Bennett,s Gabb,9 Morgan,10 Young,11 Greene,12 Field,13 and Hupp.14 Field’s case was that of a boy only 5 years old, and it seems to me to be perhaps open to some doubt, on account of the extremely small size of the process at that early age. Yet in Bennett’s case, and in one seen by Durham,16 the former in a boy of 6, and the latter in a boy of 12, the diagnosis was verified by dissection after death. In Durham’s case there was no history of injury, and nearly the whole of the scapula was lying bare in an abscess, which had involved the shoulder-joint; the assumption that “the probable sequence of events was a blow on the coracoid process with partial or entire separation, followed by acute inflammation and formation of pus,” seems to me therefore scarcely warranted. I am more inclined to believe that the epiphysis was bathed in pus, and separated by maceration. 1 Lancet, Nov. 27, 1886. 2 University Medical Magazine, March, 1891. 3 British Med.

This paper contains a very interesting discussion of the subject of traumatic separations of the epiphyses of the upper extremity.

WOUNDS AND WOUND-TKEATMENT. 36 In conclusion, therefore, we may say that the exact part taken by the nucleus or the protoplasm in the production of new cells has not yet been definitely determined, but that in all probability a very compli- cated reciprocal activity is manifested by them during this process. Direct Cell-Division.â€”Direct segmentation was formerly believed to be the only mode of cell-reproduction, before the researches of Flem- ming and others had brought to light karyokinetic changes in the nu- cleus. Now the term direct is restricted to that form of cell-division, during which no increase in the amount and no change in the arrange- ment of the nuclear chromatine is observed. It is division pure and simple, without any activity on the part of the chromatine. It agrees with this observation that direct segmentation is most frequently, per- haps only, observed in cells (leucocytes) which are destined to take no further part in regenerative and hypertrophic changes. Wherever the latter are going on, there indirect cell-division, accompanied by the cor- responding nuclear phenomena, is the rule. The immediate result of cell-division by karyokinesis is the formation of a mass of indifferent cells known as formative cells, or embryonic tis- Union of Incised Wound after Suture (6th day), a.

It is not apparent from the microscopical appearance of these cells, at an early stage, into what permanent tissues they wrill ultimately de- velop ; but it is safe to say that they will only produce cells to which they are embryologically related. Thus an epithelial cell, or more cor-

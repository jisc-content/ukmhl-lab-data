1028 INJURIES AND DISEASES OF THE FEMALE GENITALS. 2* 8° ation extends high up the FiS- 1782- rectum, the H incision is made and stitches are / placed in the vaginal flap as already described. Then the V-shaped hia- tus or defect remaining in the rectal flap is closed by the Lauenstein suture (practically that of Lem- hert), the stitches being inserted only from the surface of the wound. The operator inserts the needle into the rectal flap from his right side, caus- ing it to emerge just short of the margin of the wound, and then making it cross the hia- tus, enter, and similarly emerge on the opposite side. In this manner sutures are inserted in close order from the apex to the base of the rectal flaps, and, when tied, accurately unite the line of the wound. They present neither silk suture nor wound surface to be acted on by the rectal contents—only mucous membrane can be seen on examination hy the speculum. (Figs. 1779, 1780, 1781, 1782.) The perineal structures are next closed by silver wire, with superficial silk sutures where necessary. The af- Fig. 1783. ter-treatment differs in no wise from that already described.

Mode of introducing sutures. Division of the perineo-vaginal bridge found in this deformity may or may not be required in perineorrhaphy by flap-building. If left undivided, then the procedure is exactly that just de- scribed for simple laceration. The vaginal flap is, as before men- tioned, shaped by one transverse and two lateral incisions, and the fistulous tract in this portion is closed by buried Lauenstein (Lembert) sutures of fine silk, as shown in Fig. 1783. Similar buried sutures close the remainder of the fistula in the rectal flap. The vagi-

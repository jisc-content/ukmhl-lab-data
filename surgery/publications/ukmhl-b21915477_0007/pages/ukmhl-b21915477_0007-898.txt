DISEASES OF THE BREAST. 838 necessarily fatal. Warren thinks that we may hope for 20 per cent, of cures in the future; Butlin from 12 to 15 per cent. Less than 2 per cent, of patients who pass the three-year limit have recurrence (Dennis). With regard to the percentage of complete cures, in the majority of Billroth’s cases a simple amputation had been done (Korteweg). The same is true of the cases of Esmarch. There were cured (Korteweg):— 1 Billroth. Esmarch. Volkmann. Konig. Of 100 simple cases 10 14 17 36 Of 100 cases with glands 2 7 8 10 Within the years 1867-76 1868-75 1874-78 1875-85 This shows an increase in the number of cures in complicated as well as in simple cases. Recurrences.—In a very large percentage of cases recurrence takes place even after the most thorough operation. This reappearance of the original disease, according to some writers, depends upon a consti- tutional rather than a local cause. The weight of authority, however, decidedly favors the local nature and origin of carcinoma. Recurrences are generally regarded, therefore, as the result of incomplete excision. Dennis gives 27 per cent, more recurrences after the incomplete than after the completed operation, and regards 75 per cent., the general average of recurrence, as the result of some defect in operative technique, or of some unreasonable delay. Gross '2 reported the results in 207 cases of cancer. Of the first 100 cases, 91.75 percent, were marked by local reproduction, and there was not a single permanent recovery. In these the axilla was not cleared out. In the second series of 107 cases 10 patients died without opera- tion. Local recurrence took place after 52.77 per cent, of the opera- tions, in an average period of seven months. The average life of the thirteen who died with recurrence was 32 months, varying from 2 to 94 months. The average period since the operation upon those who still survived without recurrence, was 3 years and 3 months, varying from 8 years and 3 months to 6 months. The average interval between the operation and the first obvious re- currence, in 46 cases noted by Williams, was 26 months.3 Halsted1 gives statistics of 50 cases operated on by him at Johns Hop- kins Hospital. They are especially noteworthy because of the fact that in only three cases did recurrence take place in the area of operation. Halsted uses the term “local recurrence” to mean recurrence in any part of the region attacked by the knife. “Regionary recurrence” he defines as the multiple recurrences in the skin at a distance from the scar. In 34 cases out of the 50 there was no recurrence whatever, and in these 34 cases 24 patients were living at the time of writing, the periods since the operations varying from three and one-half months to three and one-half years. In only three cases in which recurrence took place was it in the exact area of the wound ; in eight cases it was re- gionary; five patients were not heard from. All of the cases were oper- ated upon in a uniformly thorough manner, the large pectoral muscle 1 Arcliiv f klin. Chirurg., Bd. xxxviii., S. 679. 2 Med. News, November 26, 1887; Boston Med. and Surg.

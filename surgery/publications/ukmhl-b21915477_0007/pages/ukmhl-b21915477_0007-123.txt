67 WOUND-TREATMENT. (Fig. 1572). This plan is also practicable in cases where the soft parts are too rigid to admit of approximation by buried sutures. After re- sections, the bone surfaces are brought into direct contact to pre- vent the formation of dead spaces, a precaution which is not at all neces- sary when such cases are treated with the moist blood-clot. During the first period of the development of this method, drainage was considered indispen- sable. Neuber at that time recommended the rise of absorbable drainage-tubes, hoping thus to avoid a change of dress- ings for their removal. He soon abandoned them, however, for reasons already mentioned, and adopted a method of drainage which he termed “canalization of wounds.” This consisted in the punching of holes through the skin and subjacent tissues at certain intervals, through After Neuber. which holes Fiff. 1573. drainage ample was afford- ed. But this plan was also soon given up in favor of loose sutures, which permitted the intervening wound- edges to separate slightly, allowing the secretions, if there were any, to escape. Furthermore, the ori- ginal incisions were so placed that their ends, or one of them, corre- sponded to the lowest part of the wound, which was eventually left unsutured. (Fig. 1573.) Sometimes a small A‘shaPed flap was cut at the ends of the incision, and at the close of the operation its tip was sutured to the deepest part of the wound, thus establishing a groove along which the secretions could run into the dressings (Figs. 1574, 1575)—a plan especially well adapted to resections of the knee. In his latest publication Neuber discards drainage altogether, and, relying on

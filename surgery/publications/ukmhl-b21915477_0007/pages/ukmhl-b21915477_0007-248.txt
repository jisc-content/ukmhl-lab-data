AMPUTATIONS. 19-2 Statistics. In the Article in Yol. I., pp. 598 and 619, I gave statistics of multiple and single major amputations occurring in my own practice. Since the publication of that article I have with my own hands done 153 single, 2 triple, and 10 double amputations, some particulars of which I have included in the annexed tables. An analysis of these shows that the death-rate of my operations has slightly diminished in the single amputations, and has been materially less in those of a mul- tiple character. This will appear from the following summary:— Table Showing Results of 253 Cases of Single Major Amputation. Part Involved. First Series. Cases 1-100. Second Series. 101-153. Cases Both Series.

This great improvement I attribute to the general introduction into Philadelphia during this period of the ambulance system, which enables persons seriously injured by railway or machinery accidents to he put promptly under treatment and transported without risk of hemorrhage, and lias thus been the means of saving many lives. Among the single amputations the greatest gain has been in operations in the upper extremity, with a slight im- provement in the thigh amputations; hut on the other hand the death- rate in amputations through the leg and at the knee and hip-joints has been greater than in my first series.

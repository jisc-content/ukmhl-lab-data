DISORDERS OF NUTRITION. 443 B. Disorders of Nutrition (Dystrophies). Fie;. 1613. Disorders of nutrition include all forms of atrophy or hypertrophy, or of unequal growth, due to interference with the normal process of nu- trition, whether caused by mechanical influ- ences or functional dis- turbances. Of this class are various disorders called neurotrophic: de- formities due to (1) pa- ralysis or (2) ataxia, to- gether with (3) acro- megaly, (4) rachitis, (5) osteomalacia, (6) osteitis deformans (Paget’s dis- ease), (7) gouty and rheumatic osteitis, and (8) hypertrophy follow- ing general diseases. I. Deformities from Infantile Paralysis. —Many cases of infan- tile paralysis of the ex- tremities have, as one of their features, a sup- pression of the proper growth of the hard as well as of the soft parts of the body. This defect of growth is usually uniform and universal in any part, although at times it is irregular. In some cases the degree of defective development is very remarkable. The same is true of the results of what is known as cerebral spastic paralysis. The ordinary infantile spinal paralysis consists in an anterior po- liomyelitis with changes in the anterior column of the cord. Cerebral spas- tic paralysis is a condition in which there is loss of energy of motor cells in the brain. In infantile spinal paralysis, there are atrophy, paralysis of mus- cles, and impairment of the nutrition of the bones, partly from inaction, and partly as a direct result of the lesion in the nerves or nerve centres. In the spastic form of paral- ysis there are rigidity, paralysis with muscular spasm, irregular con- Infantile Paralysis. Locomotion on all fours. (Willard.) Fig. 1614.

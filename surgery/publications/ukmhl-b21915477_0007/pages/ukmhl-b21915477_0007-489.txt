429 FRACTURES OF THE FEMUR. freshened. Ultimately the boy recovered with a useful limb, the knee- joint being supple, and the shortening amounting to only an inch. Separation of the Lower Epiphysis of the Femur.—On this subject a very excellent paper has been published by Delens,1 with an account of a case seen by him, and citations at more or less length of 27 others from various sources. In 1889, a case occurred under my own care at St. Joseph’s Hospital; and in preparing a report2 of this I collected over 30 additional instances, making in all nearly 70. In my own case, and in 26 others, the injury was due to entanglement of the leg in a moving wheel. In 3 of these, and in 6 cases due to other causes, the subjects were girls. In 45 of the cases the age of the patient wras given, showing an average of 7 years. In 14 cases reduction was effected; 2 of the children are said to have had good motion; 1 had a stiff knee; of 7 it is merely said that they did well, or had useful limbs, and in 2 the only statement is that consolidation occurred. One death occurred, from “ purulent infection. ” Eesection of the end of the shaft was performed in 6, successfully in 4; 1 case was doubtful at the time of the report, and in 1 the result is not stated. Amputations were resorted to in 29 cases, 13 primary, 9 secondary, 5 very late, 2 not stated. In 2 resection of the knee was followed by amputation.3 1 Archives Generales de Medecine, Mars et Avril, 1884. 2 Annals of Gynaecology and Paediatrics, Nov., 1890. 3 For the convenience of those who may wish to examine them, I append a list of references, embracing all the writings on the subject which have been within my reach.

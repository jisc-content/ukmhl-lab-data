POISONED WOUNDS. _L /v /V 18 Lancet, July 1, 1882. 19 Med. News, Sept. 14, 1889. 1 99 observed by himself, and quotes others from Stockbridge, Coleman, and Piffard. He says that such an occurrence has been far more frequently met with after the bites of copperheads and moccasins than after those of the rattlesnake or viper. Another case is reported by Sharp.1 Spalding2 mentions the case of a man 47 years old, who died of septi- caemia in consequence of the bite of a “Crotalus adamanteus” said to have been ten feet long. It may be well to give here the following references to reported cases: Kaufmann 3 (63 cases observed in Switzerland); Sharp4 (five cases); Alcock;5 ReillyG (two cases of “ koorial ” bite, one fatal); Thomas7 (two cases in children, both fatal); Carhart;8 Sewall;9 Fayrer.10 Non- fatal cases of bites by the puff-adder have been published by Whitty 11 and by McIntyre. 2 Cases of viper-bites have been reported by Lafitte 13 (four cases; one, in a child, fatal); one (not fatal) by Callias;14 others (not fatal) by Escard,15 Chavasse,16 and Green.17 Treatment of Snake-Bites.—Upon this subject there has been much written, and many opinions expressed, based upon theory, ex- periment, and clinical observation. One thing is certain: there is no specific remedy, which being given to a bitten person will effect his cure. There are substances which will neutralize or destroy the venom when brought in contact with it; but they cannot be depended upon to follow it up in the circulation and prevent its deadly effect. When the amount of poison absorbed is small, either because only a little has been received or because a ligature is promptly applied, recovery may take place under almost any supporting treatment. Richards 18 expresses the opinion that the poison of different snakes acts very differently; thus, cobra-venom affects the nerve-centres in the medulla, while that of the daboia is a true blood-poison. This fact should be borne in mind in estimating the value of the various remedies proposed or employed. Memminger19 reports the case of a man about 30 years old, bitten in the finger by a rattlesnake; a ligature was at once put round the arm above the elbow, and Dr. M. saw him within ten minutes after the bite was received. Whiskey was freely given, and ammonia was repeatedly injected into a vein; an Esmarch tourniquet was applied just below the shoulder, and from this downward an elastic bandage, so as to empty the limb of blood. About once an hour the tourniquet was slackened for a few seconds, an alarming collapse following on each occasion; this process was repeated six times, and then the tourniquet was taken off. Recovery was complete in a few days. 1 Gaillard’s Med. Journal, April, 1888. 2 New York Med.

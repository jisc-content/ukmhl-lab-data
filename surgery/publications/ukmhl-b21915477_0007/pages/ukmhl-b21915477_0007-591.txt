RADIUS AND ULNA. 531 ear disease. In nine cases, it is known that a useful arm was pre- served by the operation; recurrence took place in three syphilitic cases; and the ultimate functional result in three was not determined. Of my whole number of 28 cases, six proved fatal (21.4 per cent.), but in only two of these was the unfavorable result directly attributable to the operation, death in both instances being due to gangrene.

Radius and Ulna.—I have thrice had occasion to .resect portions of both bones of the forearm—twice for ununited fracture, and once for deformity following a badly treated fracture—and in all three cases with success. I have also resected the radius alone in two cases addi- tional to those referred to in Vol. III., one being a case of ununited fracture with marked displacement, and the other a case of rachitic curvature; the result in both instances was satisfactory. Three times I have resected portions of the ulna alone; once successfully, for com- pound fracture from the bite of a mule; and twrice unsuccessfully—in

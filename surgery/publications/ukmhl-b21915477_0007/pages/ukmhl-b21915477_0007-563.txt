As has been said, it meets with much more favor in England than in America, and is to be considered as a method furnishing a fixation as complete as is possible by any simple apparatus, although far from being complete in reality. The method of ambulatory treatment by traction2 was based upon the fallacious idea of permitting motion at the hip-joint without friction. Later investigation has shown that this cannot possibly occur, and that treatment by traction de- pends for its efficiency upon the fact that it induces Fig. 1646.

Much experimentation has been done with a view of determining the question whether traction really separates the joint-surfaces or not.

SURGICAL DISEASES OF THE HEAD. 624 mine absolutely what pathological condition exists; as the danger of operation, especially if it be conducted with great care not to go too far and to be as speedy as possible, is not very great; and as death itself is in most of these cases a boon, an operation may occasionally be proper. But the cases must be carefully selected, and should be limited to fa- vorable examples among those most likely to have been caused by clots, cysts, or tumors. When the brain is manifestly atrophied, as shown by a marked difference in the development of the two sides of the skull, I should advise against any operation. Linear Craniotomy for Microcephalus. In this disease the entire head is lacking in development. It may even be excessively small. There is sometimes a difficulty in deter- mining precisely the amount of the defect. The following table from Finlayson’s article 1 may be of value:— No. of Cases. Age. Head, inches. Chest, inches. Difference between Head and Chest. 100 One day 13.75 12.94 Head more than chest, 0.81 60 6 to 12 weeks 15.25 14.25 “ u u u 1.00 75 6 to 8 mouths 16.68 15.58 “ u u u 1.10 71 11 to 13 months 17.80 17.20 U U it u 0.60 67 21 to 24 months 18.38 17.85 “ a a a 0.53 50 34 to 36 months 18.70 18.61 44 u u u 0.09 60 4 to 44 years 19.20 19.72 Chest more than head, 0.52 46 6 to 64 years 19.51 20.76 44 44 “ 1.25 40 9 to 10 years 19.56 21.31 44 44 44 44 1.75 31 11 to 12 years 20.00 23.46 u u it ii 3.46 The pathology of this affection is very doubtful. Unquestionably, as a rule, the growth of the encasing hard parts is dominated by the growth of the contained soft parts, and the relative growth of the brain and skull is a resultant of the reciprocal pressure, centrifugal and cen- tripetal, which each exerts upon the other. In normal cases, in which ossification of the sutures takes place at the usual time, the skull yields before the growing brain ; but it is very possible in a brain of feeble de- velopment, lacking the power of growth, that if early ossification of the sutures should take place, this slight added resistance might over- come and check the power of expansion and growth possessed by the brain. Sometimes this ossification of the sutures is noticed even at birth, and in most cases of microcephalus, at an early period after birth. It is undoubtedly true, however, that some cases of microcephalus do not show any evidence of such premature ossification. It is very prob- able that in these cases the rate of growth both of the skull and of the brain is lessened. In microcephalus, accordingly, Lannelongue 2 proposed to make by re- section a groove in the skull about a quarter of an inch wide, in order to allow of more rapid expansion and growth of the brain. This groove is more commonly made on one or both sides of the sagittal suture, ex- tending from lowr down on the forehead into the occipital bone.

351 ANEURISM. be tied just as would the main vessel. The best method of removing a sac is more or less uncertain, and will have to be decided by the special case. Of course the most simple and easy way is to remove it without opening it, as any other tumor is removed, the first ligature being applied on the proximal side of the sac, which is then shelled out toward the distal end, and the vessel then again tied. Another method would be the application of ligatures above and below the sac, which should then be split and dissected out; or it might be expedient to begin at the distal extremity of the sac and dissect upward; but no rule can be given which would apply to every case. In the case of a burst aneurism, the extravasated blood should be removed by curette or otherwise, according as might seem proper, but at all events the ope- rator should take away the foreign body from the limb and so give rest to adjacent and important structures, as well as relieve pressure, which would unquestionably interfere with the restoration of the circulation in the limb, the main artery of which had been tied. In traumatic aneurism there is no possible doubt about the fact that the indications are to freely expose and tie the vessel above and below the seat of injury, removing the coagulum entirely if possible, and thus placing the limb in the best possible condition to recover. This is now and always has been accepted as the best treatment, and needs no dis- cussion. In order to extirpate an aneurism it is necessary to thoroughly un- cover it by external incisions, to freely open and incise overlying parts, whether soft tissue or boneâ€”the clavicle, for instance, in axillary or subclavian aneurism. The sac is not to be pulled and roughly treated, but is to be removed by dissection, and the surgeon in this operation, as in removing deep tumors elsewhere in the body, is to work with the edge of his knife well in sight, retractors being employed to draw aside adjacent structures.

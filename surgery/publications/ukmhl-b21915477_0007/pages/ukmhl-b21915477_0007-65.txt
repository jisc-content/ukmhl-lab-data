In the first instance, on both views, the final nature of the change, whether in cell or in product, is unknown; but as the change in the cell must necessarily precede that in the product, and as the doctrine of phagocytosis directs most attention to the cells, that doctrine has claims on our support out of proportion greater than any teaching that may temporarily draw our attention away from the cell to the product in which it lies, and thus exalt the product at the expense of the pro- ducer; and lastly it is claimed for the phagocytic theory that in attaching spe- cial importance to the action of certain cells—leucocytes of the blood, cells of the spleen, and lymphocytes generally—it draws attention to facts of wide physi- ological importance, namely, that it is precisely these cells that govern in a spe- cial degree the constitution of the plasma and blood serum; and that therefore, whether acquired immunity be due to a direct phagocytic action of these cells, or to antibiotic or antitoxic properties of the plasma of the blood, the cells must be specially affected by the preceding changes. This is a very fair statement of the position that must reasonably be taken in regard to the subject; but for a clear knowledge of what it is, recourse must be had to the work of Metchnikoff himself, and this is nowhere so well stated as in his Lectures upon the Comparative Pathology of Inflammation, delivered at the “ Institut Pasteur” in April and May, 1891 (Paris, 1892). In this volume he details the most important and remarkable studies upon inflammation which have appeared since the publication of Virchow’s Cellular Pathology and Cohnheim’s great work upon the Inflammatory Processes. “His the- ories of inflammation,” says Steven, “differ from all others with which we are acquainted, and this being so, they must be subjected to the most searching criticism before they can be accepted in whole or in part. They are founded upon an exhaustive and conscientious inves- tigation of biological phenomena, in so far as these bear upon this most interesting and complicated pathological process.” 1 Toward the end of the first lecture, the basis of all modern ideas in regard to inflammation is stated, when it is said that instead of plac- ing the phenomena of inflammation in two fundamentally distinct categories, regeneration and degeneration, injury and repair, they must all of them be regarded as a healthful reaction against some sort of disturbing cause. Metchnikoff shows that comparative pathology, by taking recognition of the phenomena seen in the lower invertebrates, may give information that research in the vertebrates cannot supply, on account of the presence in these latter of disturbing elements. Indeed, heretofore, it has only been possible under experimentation to eliminate one of the factors of inflammation—that of a rise of temperature— and this has been done in the frog because it is a cold-blooded animal and incapable of producing heat in any appreciable quantity. We must employ invertebrate animals in order still further to eliminate cer tain of the factors present in the process, and it is in this way only that we can ever look to be able to answer the following questions: Can the factors of traumatism, or infection, that produce inflammatory changes in the higher animals, produce anything analogous in the inferior ver- tebrates, such as the ampliioxus; or in the invertebrates is the presence of a circulatory system indispensable to the production of inflamma- 1 Glasgow Medical Journal, Sept. 1, 1892.

116 GUNSHOT WOUNDS. run through the fingers and returned as examined, if the work be done at all hurriedly; and not seldom the condition of the patient will compel haste. Consideration of the operative care and thoroughness demanded in this proceeding, and of the after-quietude of the patient which is essen- tial to recovery, make it doubtful if in military surgery, except under unusually favorable conditions, these wounds can he treated with any- thing like the same success as in civil life. The new bullet may and probably will do less damage to the abdominal viscera than the old one, and going through the body may make a way for more complete drain- age, but the large majority of those wounded will die, as they have heretofore.

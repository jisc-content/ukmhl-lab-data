HYPERTROPHY OF THE AREOLAR TISSUE. 345 When cellulitis depends upon impaction of faeces in the caecum the use of purgatives is very clearly indicated, but in the experience of the writer they should be used cautiously and frequently, rather than actively, nothing in his experience being equal to repeated and small doses of calomel, with or without opium according to circumstances, continued for some time. This treatment combined with hot fomenta- tions will often obviate a resort to the use of the knife, but if pus has once formed, its prompt evacuation by operation is imperative. The operation is often attended by most satisfactory results, and may be undertaken without the dread of wounding the peritoneum once so prevalent among surgeons, as nature has generally glued the parts together as a prelim- inary to the exit of pus. The condition of the appendix vermiformis is a question which intrudes itself into every case of perityphlitis, and in cutting down to evacuate matter in this region no surgeon would nowadays rest until he had informed himself as to the state of that organ, the question of the removal of which is considered elsewhere. Painful Hypertrophy of the Areolar Tissue.—In the Ameri- can Journal of the Medical Sciences for November, 1892 (page 521), Dr. F. X. Dercum narrates a case of what he terms “ adiposis dolorosa,” and similar cases are recorded by the same gentleman and by Dr. F. P, Henry in the University Medical Magazine for December, 1888, and in the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease for March, 1891, all of the cases having points of resemblance to myxcedema. There was a great increase of the connective and adipose tissues over greater or less areas, together with painful symptoms indicative of fugitive and irregular irri- tation of nerve trunks, possibly a neuritis. The cases were unaffected by treatment and eventually ended unfavorably, the patients dying from long-continued suffering and exhaustion.

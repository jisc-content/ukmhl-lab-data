Probably one-third of all diseases of the bones are found in children under ten years of age, while about one-half occur in persons under twenty years. In connection with tuberculous dis- ease of the bones, there is often present disease of the joints and of the sur- rounding tissues. After a certain length of time the tuberculous process in a hone causes progressive destruction of the overlying structures, until the disease extends to the surface. The communi- cation may take place by means of nar- row and tortuous sinuses, or by such destruction of tissue as causes the for- mation of large abscess-cavities outside of the bone. An illustration is seen in psoas abscess. In some cases the exter- nal manifestations are insignificant as compared with the extent of disease in the bone, as was seen in a case reported by Gangolphe, in which he amputated in the upper third of the leg, in a case of disease of the ankle-joint, because he found a depression in the tibia in- dicating a loss of substance. The wis- dom of the operation was shown when a section was made of the tibia, which was found to be occupied by a very large medullary ossifluent abscess. See Fig. 1622. The communication of tuberculous disease from bone to bone is sometimes particularly noticeable in the spinal col- umn, where the bodies of a number of vertebrae may be affected either at or about the same time. A striking illus- tration of this is seen in a specimen of M. Lannelongue, shown in Fig. 1623. Tuberculous Osteitis^of^ Vertebra;. (Lan- Tuberculosis of the bdieS OCCIirS lUOSt

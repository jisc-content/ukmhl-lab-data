560 ORTHOPEDIC SURGERY. The 'tipper extremities are sometimes so shortened and misshapen as to hear a resemblance to fins. The radius and ulna may be bent or absent, and congenital defects of the fingers are not rare. The most common deficiencies are where two or more fingers are consolidated into one, or where some fingers are entirely absent. In these cases there are usually associated deformities in other portions of the body. While these bony defects are irremediable in themselves, yet surgery can frequently lessen the deformity and greatly assist in facilitating locomotion. Subcutaneous or open myotomies and tenotomies, osteot- omies, etc., with or without subsequent employment of apparatus, will accomplish much, and plastic surgery will often be helpful.

900 INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION. As I have already remarked, Seim's operation was rightly looked upon as a decided improvement upon end-to-end suture as formerly practised, but it has not proved entirely satsifactory, and surgeons are, I think, again looking to a modified form of circular enterorrhaphy as a preferable method. The difficulty of close adjustment has been in a great measure overcome by an ingenious device of Maunsell, who in- vaginates both cut ends through a slit in the larger segment, sews them together accurately in this position, and then draws them back into place, closing the slit with a separate suture. To avoid the trouble which sometimes arises from the different calibre of the two portions of intestine, oblique, instead of circular, enterorrhaphy is employed by R. T. Morris, Connell, and other surgeons. Finally, Murphyâ€™s buttons may be equally well employed for end-to-end as for lateral approxima- tion, and if further experience shall confirm the reports heretofore made as to their efficiency and safety, in their use will, I think, be found the best means of restoring the continuity of a resected bowel.

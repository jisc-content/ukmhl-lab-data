CONSTRUCTION AND ORGANIZATION OF HOSPITALS. 1052 complished by a simple and effective application of the extraction system, and renders it easy to change the air of the wards and rooms at least three or four times an hour when desired. The plumbing is fitted with the best modern appliances; all pipes and traps are exposed, and discharge into risers of soil-pipe in pipe-shafts which serve also for the ventilation of these special apartments. All water-pipes also have their risers in these shafts, the waste heat from those for hot water aiding the ventilation. The furnishing selected by Mr. Hitchcock is of the best materials and admirably suited to the strictest hospital requirements. The Arnot-Ogden Memorial Hospital, at Elmira, N. Y., opened in 1888, is an excellent example of modern American hospitals of this class. It is a private benefaction, and was built as a memorial of the Arnot and Ogden families. According to Burdett’s classification it is of the single pavilion type, or straight plan, consisting of two pavilions Fig. 1805. placed end to end with the administration interposed. The plan (Fig. 1805) shows the hospital as originally built: a surgical ward of II beds, with an operating-room having a mosaic floor and marbleized walls, has since been added in the rear of the ward for men, as also a small building for the isolation of special cases. The administration block is of three stories; on the first floor are the offices, etc., as shown in the plan; on the two floors above are the maternity and children’s wards, private rooms, and the sleeping-rooms of the nurses. The total capacity is between 40 and 50 beds. The general wards are of one story only; there is an open fireplace in each, with steam-heating by indirect radiation, and a propulsion fan. The material is brick, hard- wood floors, and the interior walls are painted. The cost of the build- ings, including heating apparatus and plumbing, was about $72,000;

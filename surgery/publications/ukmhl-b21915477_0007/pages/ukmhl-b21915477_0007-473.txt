413 FRACTURES OF THE RIBS, COSTAL CARTILAGES, AND STERNUM. forward, and the first rib broken where the artery crossed over it; the second rib was broken at its mid-point, and the third and fourth behind their angles, wounding the lung. Here the above-mentioned explanation seems clearly applicable. I have lately had under my care at the Pennsylvania Hospital a man aged 21, in whom the impact of a wagon-pole had driven the cartilage of the left third rib directly back- ward, separating it from its connections. The only symptoms were those of shock; and perfect recovery ensued, but with the fragment in its abnormal position. Lane 1 found in a dissecting-room subject, a man aged 56, fractures of the seventh rib (incompletely united), of the eighth (the inner wall only), and of the ninth (the outer wall only). Several new cases of fractures of ribs by muscular action have been put upon record: from sneezing (eighth right rib) by Wyman;2 from coughing (second left rib) by Brown,3 (eighth left rib) by Masser,4 (place not stated) by Desnos,6 in a man aged 30, an asthmatic, and in a man aged 60, the subject of bronchitis;6 from vomiting (ninth right rib), in a woman aged 31, by Hawley;7 from missing in making a hammer-blow, in a very strong man aged 54, by Underhill;8 in this last case three ribs, the sixth, seventh and eighth of the left side, gave way. In one curious case reported by Bird,9 a lady made a great effort in lifting, and fracture of the second left rib took place. Apropos of two other instances, observed by himself and Dr. E. Martin, Tunis10 has given a very good resume of the literature of this subject. Annandale11 has reported the case of a man aged 29, who by an explosion sustained a compound comminuted fracture of the tenth and eleventh ribs on the left side, wounding the spleen and pleura; pericarditis supervened, for which paracentesis was performed, but death ensued on the thirteenth day. Other instances of fractured ribs have been recorded by Cantlie,12 by Neal,13 and by Sheild.14 In the last-mentioned case, a man aged 47 was crushed against a wall by a wagon-pole, and had fracture of the third and fourth left ribs, with complete rupture of the left bronchus. Rolles- ton 15 reports three cases of extensive and fatal crushes of the chest, in one of which the right bronchus was torn entirely across, and the lung wounded; in another there was fracture of the scapula, and rupture of the spleen and left kidney. In all, the first and several other ribs were broken. Barth 16 saw a case in which a man aged 46 died suddenly on the ninth day after sustaining a fracture of the sixth right rib by direct violence; the pleura was found to have been torn, and an enormous effusion of blood had occurred from a ruptured intercostal artery. 1 Trans, of Pathological Society of London, 1884. 5 Journ. of Am.

S.” Crepitus is said to have been felt “ over several of the lowest ribs. ” Medical Standard, May, 1890. 9 Australian Med. Journal, May 15, 1889. 11 British Med.

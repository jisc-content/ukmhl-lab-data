882 HERNIA. gut is cut across, the longitudinal muscular layer retracts, carrying the peritoneal layer with it, and leaving the thick mucous membrane protruding about one-eighth of an inch. The object of the Czerny Fig. 1732. Resection of Intestine. The suturing completed. suture is to bring the mucous membrane and connective tissue upon which it rests together, and thus strengthen the line of union, after adhesion occurs. If this is not done, the slight adhesions between the peritoneal sur- faces obtained by the Lembert suture might give way under the strain of distention by gas or ingested matter. The objection to passing a suture entirely through the wall of the gut, and thus approximating all the coats at once, is the danger that the perforation by the needle and suture may permit the escape of gas or toxic contents. The inversion of the mucous membrane by the Czerny suture, and of the peritoneal layer by the Lembert suture, after Fig. 1733. Fig. 1734. Czerny and Lembert Sutures; the threads tied. the threads are tied, is shown in Fig. 1734. In suturing the intestine, the very finest silk and delicate half-curved needles should be em- ployed. The silk should be made aseptic by boiling and by immersion in 1-2000 bichloride solution, from which it is taken as the needles

DISEASES AND INJURIES OF BURSiE. 402 tous growth can develop from any bursa, that is, a structure originating solely from connective tissue. Tnffier describes a fibro-myxoma of the ischiatic bursa,1 and E. Estor a primary sarcoma of the prepatellar bursa.2 Chavasse reported a case of cystic myxoma of the deep pre-tibial (?) bursa to the Societe de Chirurgie.3 Nicaise has seen two sarcomata of the prepatellar bursa grafted upon old hygromata. One case occurred in the service of Dolbeau, the other was his own.4 I have myself re- moved from over both olecranon processes of the same individual, fibro-cartilaginous tumors which arose from the bursae in this region. From the diversity of these bursal growths and the small number of cases possible to deal with, no useful conclusions can be drawn, while for similar reasons, and because each variety of growth eventually pur- sues the course of the class to which it belongs, nothing special need be said as to their diagnosis. Bunion.-—When suppuration has taken place in those cases of bunion in which marked deformity of the metatarso-phalangeal joint of the great toe exists (hallux valgus). Riedel has recently in four cases se- cured a good functional result, the first toe being brought into a fairly normal position, although the remaining toes remained abducted. The bursal sac is carefully excised and the exostoses are removed from the head of the metatarsal bone and base of the phalanx, after which the head of the metatarsal bone is chiselled down until smooth, and of such a form as will admit of an approximate restoration of the member to its normal axis.6 1 Progres Med., 1884, tome xii., p. 545. 2 Gaz.

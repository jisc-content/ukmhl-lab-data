639 SURGERY OF THE VENTRICLES. Of all the methods proposed, that of Hartley and Krause seems to be the best. Rose’s operation has the disadvantages that the muscles of mastication on one side are paralyzed, and that the lower jaw may be dis- placed so that the teeth are no longer opposed. The parotid has been wounded and the seventh nerve paralyzed. The im- mediate proximity of the trephine opening to that of the Eustachian tube has twice induced death from septic meningitis. In the small number of cases thus far reported, the mortality by Rose's method is some- what greater than by Hart- ley’s. Fig. 1696 shows the result in one of my cases. Surgery of the Lateral and Fourth Ventricles IN RELATION TO INCREASED Intracranial Pressure. Puncture of the lateral ventricles through the an- terior fontanelle for hydro- cephalus is an old opera- tion, but in 1881 Wernicke first proposed trephining and puncture of the ven- tricles in completely ossi- fied skulls, and again Zenner, of Cincinnati, in 1886 made a similar suggestion. The first publication, however, in which the steps of the operation were distinctly formulated was a paper which I read before the College of Physicians of Philadelphia, on Nov. 7, 1888.1 In Au- gust, 1890, before the Tenth International Medical Congress in Berlin, I presented an elaborate paper, covering the whole surgery of the lateral ventricles up to that time.2 The earliest case in which the operation was done, though not re- ported till after my paper was published, was that of von Bergmann,3 on Juty 15, 1887, and the second operation was by Ayres and Hers- man on Dec. 4, 1888.4 The third case operated on was my own. on Jan. 11, 1889, and the fourth was that of Mr. Mayo Robson, on Feb. 7 of the same year.5 Since then a considerable number of cases have been operated on, some of which will be referred to hereafter. 1 Med. News, Dec. 1, 1888. 2 Unfortunately the MS. of this paper, of which I had no copy, was lost by the authorities of the Congress, and only a resume was printed in the Med. News, Sept. 20, 1890, Lancet, Sept. 13, 1890, and Rev. de Chir., 1891, p. 45. a Chir. Behand. d. Hirnkrank., 1889. 4 Pittsburg Med. Review, March. 1889. 5 Brit. Med. Journal, Dec. 6, 1890. Fig. 1696.

DISEASES OF BONES. 472 bone may be in either direction: first, onward in the bone itself; second, toward a neighboring joint. The annexed illustrations, Figs. 1629-1634, taken from an able paper by Mr. J. H. Targett,1 show the appearance presented in various cases of hydatids of the bones. If the progress is toward a joint, the hydatid does not invade the cartilage, Fig. 1630. Human Humerus, Fractured.

The de- struction of a joint, such as the coxo-femoral, may result in a disloca- tion of the head of the femur, through disintegration of the cotyloid cavity, into the pelvis. Connected with a hydatid of the bones there may be invasion of the surrounding tissue, or, by rupture of the cyst, infiltration with the for- mation of sinuses, or of abscesses precisely like the ossifluent abscesses found in other disorders of bones. When hydatids approach the surface—which they do very slowly and without exciting constitutional symptoms—they may be mistaken Fig. 1631. Fig. 1632. Ischium of an Ox.

If, under these circumstances the surgeon opens them and puts their interior in communication with the air, they im- mediately change their character, and produce violent constitutional disturbance, which may end in death, 1 Guy’s Hospital Reports, vol. 1., 1894.

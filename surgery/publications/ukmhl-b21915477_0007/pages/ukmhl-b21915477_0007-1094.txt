INJURIES AND DISEASES OF THE FEMALE GENITALS. 1034 are accessible, when the second set of clamps is applied; this not being sufficient, a third is used, and the uterus is freed by dividing the re- maining portions of the ligaments. Small haemostatic forceps are at hand. In case ligation is employed, properly prepared antiseptic catgut is ready, and strongly curved needles and needle forceps, or, as some operators prefer, the Deschamps needle; Olshausen uses the latter with different curves, while Martin employs the former. The patient is in the dorso-sacral position, the parts are thoroughly disinfected, and strong toothed forceps (Fig. 1787) are employed to seize the cervix. The uterus is first drawn forward by the forceps, so that Fig. 1793. Vaginal Extirpation of Uterus. Douglasâ€™s pouch opened. (Martin.) the posterior cul-de-sac is exposed, and the operator opens through it into the peritoneum, cutting closely to the uterus. (Fig. 1792.) Martin then stitches the vaginal and peritoneal surfaces of the wound together. The next step is the introduction of lateral sutures, one on each side; each stitch is carried so deeply as to include the base of the broad ligaments, and if not the uterine artery, at least its lower branches. (Fig. 1793.) This accomplished, the operator next opens the anterior cul-de-sac, the cervix being drawn backward; a semicircular incision is first made, and then the separation of the connective tissue between the uterus and the bladder is accomplished with the finger, though the knife or scis- sors may occasionally be required to divide firm tissue. Some object, on the ground of risk of infection, to immediately opening the peritoneal cavity, but Martin does it at once, and, as in the posterior opening,

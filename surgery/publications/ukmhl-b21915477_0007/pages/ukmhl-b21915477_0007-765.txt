This, I believe, concludes the list of special instruments needed in this operation. Besides these, of course, there will be needed a strong straight knife, a blunt periosteum elevator, an ordinary thumb forceps Fig. 1701. for removing chips of bone, one or two Bowman’s probes, seven or eight long and slender self-clamping artery forceps, and needles curved flatwise.

COMPARISON OF OPERATIVE METHODS. 909 Of course some growths are palpably suitable for excision, and the surgeon would be derelict who neglected to remove them; these are the limited growths which can be completely excised without too great danger to life, such for example as epitheliomata near the margin of the anus. Here we have a class of cases showing excellent results as to recurrence, with little mortality from the operation itself. Again there are other cases where colotomy should as unquestionably be done, and not extirpation even though manually possible. These are the cases of extensive disease involving not only the rectum but the sur- rounding tissues and base of the bladder, and which have already led to lymphatic deposits. Between these is a class of cases about which the practice of surgeons will differâ€”the cases of deposit in the rec- tal pouch which, though involving two or three inches of the gut longitudinally in all its circumference, are still movable on subja- cent tissues and can therefore be completely extirpated and without very great immediate risk. These are the cases that lead to so much disappointment. A brilliant and grave surgical operation is done, the growth is completely eradicated, and yet the patient is hardly convales- cent before there is a recurrence in the cicatrix. The sad truth is that cancer of the rectum is an exceedingly fatal disease, and but little amenable to treatment by the knife, tending as it always does to rapid recurrence. We shorten many lives by attempt- ing its removal, and I have been unwillingly forced to the conclusion that, excepting in the class of mild cases referred to, we can do more good by colotomy than by excision, and can secure an average and ag- gregate greater length of days.

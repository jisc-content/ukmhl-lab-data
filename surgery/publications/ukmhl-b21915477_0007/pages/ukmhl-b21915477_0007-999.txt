(939) INJURIES AND DISEASES OF THE URETHRA BY THOMAS R. NEILSON, M.D. PROFESSOR OF GENITO-URINARY SURGERY IN THE PHILADELPHIA POLYCLINIC, SURGEON TO THE EPISCOPAL HOSPITAL AND TO ST. CHRISTOPHER’S HOSPITAL, PHILADELPHIA. Exploration of the Urethra and Bladder. Endoscopy.—Direct visual examination of the urethra and bladder has, through the aid of the perfected instruments in use at the present time, come to be recognized as a step of the greatest value in the diag- nosis and treatment of the pathological states of these organs. Indeed, in many instances, an exploration of the urethra or bladder might justly be considered incomplete without the employment of the F,s- 1746- endoscope. * The development and perfection of endoscopic instruments present an interesting history, a brief out- line of which it seems proper to give in this place. The credit of having produced the first endoscope which was of practical value be- longs to Desormeaux, who in 1853 brought his instrument to the notice of the —B Academy of Medicine of Paris, although others before him had worked in the field of endoscopy, Bozzini, of Frankfort, having been the first, in 1807. The Desormeaux instrument (Fig. 1716) consists of a lantern contain- ing a petroleum lamp, there being on one side of the case an aperture through which the light passes into a tube secured to, but capable of being freely turned upon, the case. In the tube is a lens which condenses the light, and, set at right angles to the long axis, reflects the light in the line of the axis of the endosco- pic tube or speculum. This latter is attached to one end of the cylin- der, while in the other is an aperture through which the observer looks.

363 VARIX. shown that the histological structure of the veins differs as to thickness and strength in various individuals from their birth. If we accept the foregoing views, we are led to consider the treatment of varicose veins from two main standpoints. If the formation of varix is due to the combination of continued augmented pressure with a morbid condition of the vein-walls, we will not expect a radical cure from the elimination of only one of the factors which go to make up the disorder, but will endeavor to combine a systemic treatment with some proceeding, palliative or operative, to eliminate the local discrepancy in equal distribution of pressure. And, in point of fact, we know by long experience that most methods aiming at a radical cure, which have only attacked the one factor of undue pressure, have proved futile, in that a recuiTence after a longer or shorter interval has been observed, about two years on the average. Notwithstanding these theoretical conclusions, we find a great in- crease in the number of operative measures employed for the radical cure of varicose veins, keeping pace with the advances in antiseptic and aseptic methods. The procedures most generally favored at the present time are mul- tiple ligations, subcutaneous (Scliede, C. Phelps) or open (Bennett), of the varicose veins; excisions of more or less extensive portions of the dis- eased veins (Madelung); and the ligation of the trunk of the saphena (Trendelenburg). The latter method is advised only for cases where the saphenous trunk is enlarged as well as its branches. A new palliative method has been devised by Landerer, who occludes the enlarged veins by means of pressure exercised by parabolic springs with pads filled with water, worn around the leg after the manner of a truss.

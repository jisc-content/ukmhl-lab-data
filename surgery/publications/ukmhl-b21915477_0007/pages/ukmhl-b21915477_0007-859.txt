(799 ) INTUBATION OF THE LARYNX. BY HENRY R. WHARTON, M.D., DEMONSTRATOR OF SURGERY IN THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA, SURGEON TO THE PRESBYTERIAN, METHODIST, AND CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS; ASSISTANT SURGEON TO THE UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, ETC., PHILADELPHIA. The operation of intubation of the larynx consists in passing a spe- cially constructed metal tube through the mouth into the larynx, for the relief of dyspnoea resulting from laryngeal stenosis. Since the intro- duction of this operation by O’Dwyer, in 1880, it has been employed both in this country and abroad in many thousands of cases of obstruc- tive dyspnoea, and is now generally recognized as a valuable surgical procedure for the relief of that condition developing in cases of diph- theritic and membranous croup, or in cases of cicatricial stenosit of the larynx, oedema or spasm of the glottis, bilateral paralysis of the abduc- tors, or paresis of the cords from disuse. The indications for the opera- tion of intubation of the larynx in cases of obstructive dyspnoea are similar to those which are recognized as calling lor the operation of tracheotomy for the relief of this condition. Prognosis.—The number of recoveries following the operation of intubation of the larynx is very similar to the number following trache- otomy. Ranke, in an analysis of 2500 cases of intubation, mostly from hospital practice, found that in the first year of life intubation gave apparently better results than tracheotomy, 13 per cent, of recov- eries in contrast to 5.4 per cent, bv the latter operation; in the second year intubation gave 32.3 per cent, of recoveries against 25.4 per cent, by tracheotomy. Ball, in a collection of 4217 cases of intubation gathered from American and European sources, found that there were 1285 recoveries, or about 30.4 per cent. Ball's statistics show that 60 cases under 1 year of age gave 11 recoveries, or 18.3 per cent. 253 “ “ 2 years “ “ 3 “ “ “ “ 48 “ 19.0 306 “ “ 67 “ 21.9 “ “ 326 “ “ 4 “ “ 11 “ 98 “ 30.0 “ “ 231 “ “ 5 “ “ “ “ 93 “ 40.0 “ iC 127 “ “ 6 " ‘ “ “ 48 “ 37.8 “ Ranke's statistics show that intubation gives better results than trache- otomy in the first and second years of life; from this age the difference between the two operations as far as recoveries go is not very marked. Too much reliance should not be placed upon these comparative statis- tics, for many operators perform intubation at a time when the dys-

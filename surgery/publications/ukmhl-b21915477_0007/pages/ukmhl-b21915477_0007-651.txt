591 DISEASES OF BRAIN FROM SUPPURATIVE DISEASE OF MIDDLE EAR. of the temporal bone runs a deep groove for the lateral sinus, which terminates in the internal jugular vein. Moreover, a section of the mastoid process and adjacent portion of the petrous part of the tem- poral bone shows that the layer of bone between the tympanum and the middle fossa (Figs. 1685, 1686), and also between the mastoid cells and the groove for the lateral sinus in the posterior fossa, is exceed- ingly thin. It is evident, therefore, that this bone in either of these places may readily become carious and be perforated in disease of the middle ear, and be the cause of thrombosis of the lateral sinus and the jugular vein, or of abscess either of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe or of the cerebellum. Pathology.—Barker estimates that in Great Britain, with only one-half the population of the United States, there are probably 2000 deaths annually from ear disease; and of this number a large propor- tion is caused by the cerebral complications of that affection. Of 43,730 cases of ear disease tabulated by Burkner, 66.9 per cent, were of disease of the middle ear, and 29 per cent, were of suppurative disease of the same part. Four-fifths of these were chronic cases, and it is among these especially that the brain lesions developed. Koerner 1 showed that in 100 cases of cerebral abscess arising from ear disease, 62 existed in the cerebrum and 32 in the cerebellum, and that in 6 both the cerebrum and the cerebellum were involved. He gives also the following table as to ages:— Age. Cerebrum. Cerebellum. Total. Up to 10 years 12 2 14 11-20 “ 13 9 22 21-30 “ 19 10 29 31-40 “ 11 3 14 Over 40 “ 7 5 12 62 29 91 showing that under 10 years of age cerebellar disease is comparatively rare. This is explained, according to Hartmann, by the fact that the distance of the posterior fossa of the skull from the organ of hearing is greater in children than in the adult. Such abscesses are much more common in the male than in the female, and also much more common in the cerebrum than in the cerebellum, as shown by the following figures (Koerner) Sex. Cerebrum. Cerebellum. Total. Male 43 18 01 Female 18 12 30 61 30 91 The right side also is more frequently affected than the left in the proportion of 59 to 38 cases, both sides being involved three times. These abscesses will of course lie either near to or next to the bone, that is, will be either in the temporo-sphenoidal lobe or in the cerebellum. Only 7 of Koerner’s 100 cases were situated elsewhere. Naturally it would be presumed that if the discharge from the ear were very fetid it would be more dangerous than if the pus were without any such odor. But Rohrer has shown undoubtedly that non-fetid dis- 1 Die otitiscbe Erkrank. d. Hirns, d. Hirnhiiute, und d. Blutleiter, 1894.

There is a third and rarer form of inguinal hernia known as the encysted hernia of Sir Astley Cooper. This variety of hernia is produced as follows: The vaginal pro- cess, that part of the perito- neal pouch which surrounds the spermatic cord from the internal to the external ring, and which normally is closely adherent to the cord, not per- mitting the entrance of any of the abdominal contents, is closed at the internal, hut re- mains unclosed at the exter- nal ring. The hernia, de- scending, pushes before it the parietal peritoneum as in ordinary hernia, and carries it gradually downward until it is protruded into the unclosed vaginal process be- low,â€™ forming in this way two sacs. It will be seen that an oblique inguinal hernia is congenital when it follows exactly in the route trav- elled by the testicle in its descent, and lies in contact with this organ. This form of hernia exists generally at birth, but it has been known to occur after birth and even in adult life, in rare instances when the vagi- nal process and tunica funiculi have not firmly united and are easily broken through. In an infantile hernia, which oc- curs, as its name implies, usually soon after birth, but which may also, in exceptional instances, occur later in life, the intestine descends along the tubular sheath which sur- rounds the spermatic cord, but finds this sheath closely attached to the cord at the upper margin of the testicle where it is arrested; and Congenital Inguinal Hernia. while by its weight it may descend Fig. 1723.

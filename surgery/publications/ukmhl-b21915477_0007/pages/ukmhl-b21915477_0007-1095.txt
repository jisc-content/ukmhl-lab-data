VAGINAL HYSTERECTOMY. 1035 stitches the peritone- FlS- !?93- urn and vaginal wall, these stitches, usually four, immediately ar- resting the bleeding. The uterus is now re- troverted, the broad ligaments on each side are in succession ligat- ed, beginning at the upper portion, now the lowest, and three liga- tures being employed; after one side is ligated —it is usual to begin with the left—the tis- sues are cut close to the uterus, and then the ligation of the still attached side is easily effected. In case the operator prefers ligation in situ, the cervix is drawn to the opposite side to that which he wishes to tie, a Deschamps needle is passed from before backward, the catgut is withdrawn, the nee- Vaginal Extirpation of Uterus. Introduction of lateral sutures. (Martin.) Fig. 1794. Vaginal Hysterectomy. Introduction of thread at base of right broad ligament. (Bonnet et Petit.) die removed, and the former tied (Fig. 179-1). By a similar manoeuvre, a ligature is placed upon the other side; after the ligation, the tissues are divided close to the neck. The uterus, now more movable, is drawn down, and again ligatures are introduced, to include more of the broad ligament, on each side; again the tissues, hemor- rhage being thus prevented, are divided, and the uterus is drawn still lower, so that often a third ligature on each side includes the remaining portion of the broad ligament. The Use of Clamp-Forceps. —If this means of preventing hemorrhage is preferred, some have applied the instrument with the uterus drawn down, after refcroverting it; in either case, both anterior and poste-

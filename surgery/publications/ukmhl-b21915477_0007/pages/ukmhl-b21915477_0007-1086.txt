The latter is then thickly strewn with iodoform and covered with a pad of iodoform gauze, one end of which is inserted into the vagina. A mass of sublimate wood-wool completes the dressing, and, the thighs being approximated, the patient is transferred to her bed. The post-operative treatment comprises the use of the glass catheter twice daily for the first five days, always followed by blowing freshly powdered iodoform over the wound. This forms a sort of soft iodoform scab, absorbing all fluids and maintaining the line of sutures in a perfectly dry condi- tion. Sanger lays stress on regularity of defecation, giving a laxative on the fourth or fifth day, and each second or third day thereafterâ€”the anal region being carefully irrigated after every ac- tion. Should, however, the bowels move before the fourth day after the opera- tion, no harm need be feared, owing to the early union of the wound surfaces. The superficial sutures are removed on ones on the fourteenth day after repair, when the patient may be allowed to leave her bed. Fig. 1778.

ASTRAGALUS. 539 a good recovery, with the foot in excellent position, but died three months afterward from diphtheria. Of the varus cases five were suc- cessful, the scaphoid as well as the astragalus having been removed in one of these, and one terminated fatally. This was a case of very great deformity in an adult, and amputation would have been a safer remedy than excision. A great part of the anterior tarsus was removed as well as the astragalus, and considerable force was used in bringing the foot into position; gangrene ensued, and in spite of prompt ampu- tation death followed.

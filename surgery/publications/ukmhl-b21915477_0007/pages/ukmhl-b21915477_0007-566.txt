506 DISEASES OF THE JOINTS. ally produce distraction, it will be desirable to employ it, this being entirely independent of any attempt to limit the motion of the hip joint. The specimens represented by the annexed cuts (Figs. 1647, 1648) speak most emphatically for the thorough use of this method. Fig. 1647. Fig. 1648. Head and Neck of Femur Without Traction. Head and Neck of Femur after Employment of Traction. Fig. 1650. Fig. 1649. The specimen shown in Fig. 1648 is of the head and neck of the femur where excision was done after two or three years of efficient treatment by traction, but where the reparative process was not sufficient to establish a cure; the patientâ€™s general condition failed, and excision was resorted to. It is to be noticed that there is very little alteration in the shape of the head of the excised femur. This, compared with the specimen shown in Fig. 1647, an excision in a patient with hip disease of similar severity and duration where no traction had been applied, would appear fairly to show the effect of traction in saving the head of the femur from destruction. If an indication for surgical treatment is ever clearly written in pathological specimens, certainly that of distraction should never be overlooked. It should always be remembered that in treating hip disease at a certain stage, the ob- ject should not be simply rest, or fixa- tion, or protection from jar, but actual distraction, and that traction short of this is inefficient. Traction while the patient is going about can be most easily produced by the long traction splint known as the Davis, Sayre, or Taylor splint. The especial form and construction of this splint are matters of very slight con- spimt; "incurved Pei- sequence provided that its aim be kept

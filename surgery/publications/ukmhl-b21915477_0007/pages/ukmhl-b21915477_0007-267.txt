211 FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCE. tween the epithelial and sarcomatous or endothelial tumors which they have worked out on this plan. In distinguishing between benign and malignant growths, W. Rogers Williams lays stress upon the influence of the independent cell-life in the production of tumors, and claims that the distinction is essential and inherent in the differences between the life of the ceils in lowly and highly organized tissues. In tissues of low organization, the main feature of the cell is growth and reproduction; in the highly organized it is functional, fulfilling some duty for the rest of the organism. In the former it is free from restraint, while in the latter it has lost its autonomy, perfected its evolution, diminished its vitality, and is under the restraining influence of the organized tissue of which it is a part. Consequently, in such growths as lipoma and adenoma, the cells come nearer to having a distinct function, and are less dangerous, than in sarcoma and carcinoma, where they are elementary, growing wildly without restraint, their whole vitality occupied in unlimited and object- less reproduction. Frequency of Occurrence. The fullest clinical statistics as to the occurrence of neoplasms j'et collected are those of Williams, based on 14,-180 cases of tumors of all kinds in certain of the great London hospitals, and those of Gurlt, based on 16,637 cases from similar sources in Vienna. These reports include both medical and surgical cases, and are at least representative of the clinical side of tumors as they appear in the class of population which is liable to be found in general hospitals. As there may be reasons in race or climate, or in some local condition, which cause the discrepancies be- tween these two sets of figures, and as each has a sufficiently large num- ber of cases to rule out any questions as to accidental variations, such as might affect the results of smaller collections, I shall give these sets of figures separately, where they seem useful in considering the vari- ous forms of growth, rather than attempt to combine both in order to obtain averages. In the first place, some idea as to the relative frequency of the va- rious forms of tumor may be obtained from the following table:â€” Table Showing Relative Frequency of Various Forms of Tumor.

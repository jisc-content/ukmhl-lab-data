415 FRACTURES OF THE CLAVICLE. McKee 1 II has recorded a case of fracture of the right clavicle 2^ inches from the middle of the supra-sternal notch, by muscular action, in a man aged 40, who was trying to lift a heavy weight. A false joint had formed, but no treatment was instituted. Kohler2 met with a case in which, among other fractures, there was one near the sternal end of the clavicle, which was itself luxated up- ward; the short inner fragment was drawn upward by the sterno- cleido-mastoid muscle, so that its broken end was close to the edge of the jaw. A case is recorded by Bennett3 in which a young man aged 19, crushed under a mass of masonry, had in one clavicle two fractures, a complete one at the sternal end, and an incomplete one at the middle. Compound fracture of this bone is reported by Russell ;4 cases of non- union, successfully treated by resection and wiring, are recorded by Barker 5 in a boy of 12, by Pollard6 in a girl 16^ months old, and by Powers.7 In this last case, that of a man aged 29, the deltoid muscle was atrophied; abduction was limited, and rotation, flexion, and exten- sion were practically lost. The fragments having been wired together by Bull, complete union ensued, and the functions were almost entirely restored under massage, faradization, and exercise. In an instance reported by Twynam,8 a young girl was thrown from a horse, and sustained a fracture of the right clavicle; five days after- ward an aneurismal swelling was noted, became very large, and on the 31st day was treated by operation. An incision was made in the median line, and a ligature was placed on the innominate, supposed to be the carotid, which latter vessel was afterward found and tied. Death ensued in eighteen hours, preceded by coma, and by paralysis of the left side of the face and right side of the chest. It seemed probable that there was pressure on the phrenic nerve, as well as cerebral em- bolism. A case is recorded0 in which, in a girl aged 8, a bandage and axillary pad were applied on the third day, and gangrene ensued by the seventh, necessitating amputation ten days subsequently. A suit for damages, brought against the surgeon, fell through because of the proof of negligence on the part of the parents of the child; but the costs were divided. In an article10 on nervous disturbances consecutive upon fractures of the clavicle by indirect violence, Chavier asserts that these may result from an ascending neuritis set up by contusion of the nerves, inde- pendently of any irritation by splinters, by callus, or by the pressure of apparatus. Cases of fracture of both clavicles simultaneously have been recorded by Bennett," in a girl aged 6 years; in adults, by J. Wm. White,12 by Owen,13 by Page," and by Boger.15 Good results were obtained in all these cases except Bennett's, in which other injuries proved fatal, and Boger's, in which the patient was intractable.

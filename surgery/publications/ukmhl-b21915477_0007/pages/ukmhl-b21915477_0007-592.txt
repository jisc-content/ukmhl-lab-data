EXCISIONS AND RESECTIONS. 532 one case for syphilitic necrosis, the patient dying some time afterward from visceral disease of the same character, and in the other case for sarcoma of the ulna, the disease promptly recurring, as it did again after amputation, and the patient dying from secondary growths in the thorax. Wrist-Joint and Carpus.—I have not had occasion to resort to complete excision of the carpus and wrist-joint, and my judgment as to this operation remains the same as that expressed in Yol. III., viz., that it is seldom required, most cases of wrist-disease which call for any operation being better adapted to amputation than to excision. I have, however, in one case removed the first row of the carpus with the articulating extremities of the radius and ulna, and in another case the second row of the carpus, both patients recovering from the opera- tions, but sinuses persisting when they passed from my observation, so that I cannot speak of the ultimate result as regards functional utility. Hip-Joint.—My personal experience with excision of this articula- tion now embraces fifty-eight cases, one of which was a re-excision for recurrent disease.

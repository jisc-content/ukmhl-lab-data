EXPLORATION OF THE URETHRA AND BLADDER. 941 Klotz again modified the tube by leaving off the funnel-shaped end, simply retaining the disk attached to the extremity of the tube. (Fig. 1749.) Of the bivalve variety, Auspitz has produced one, the sides of which are separated by pressing together the two parts of the handle. The Fig. 1750. Auspitzâ€™s Bivalve Endoscope. instrument is introduced, like the cylindrical endoscopes, with an obturator in place. The objection to it, which is very potent, is that when opened its parts are not parallel, the vesical or distal ends separating, while the ocular end does not. For this reason, illumina- tion of the deeper portion of the urethra cannot be perfectl}7 effected with this instrument, the width of the beam of light being limited to the diameter of the orifice at the proximal extremity. (Fig. 1750.) F. Tilden Brown,1 of New York, has given to the profession two excellent bivalve specula, one of which is made of wire, with open Fig. 1751. sides, while in the other the sides are solid. (Figs. 1751, 1752.) Both are so arranged that the sides, when separated by means of screw attachments, remain parallel. For the wire speculum is claimed the advantage that it gives a very much greater exposure of the urethra than does the endoscopic tube, and that it affords a view, therefore, of the walls of the urethra for its entire length, as well as at its extremity. 1 Journ.

881 SYMPTOMS, DIAGNOSIS, AND TREATMENT OF HERNIA. drawn out until five or six inches of sound gut are exposed. These may be grasped by the thumb and finger of an assistant' close to the level of the abdominal wall, or, if the hand of an assistant would be in the way, a broad, disinfected tape may be tied loosel}' around each end of the intestine near the ring, to prevent the possibility of retraction or escape of the bowel or its contents inward. With sharp scissors the in- testine is divided squarely across at each end of the limit of necrosis (at right angles to its axis), and a triangular piece is cut from the mesen- tery, the base of which corresponds to the section of intestine removed; it is very important, however, to leave the mesentery protruding at least one-eighth to one-fourth of an inch longer than the bowel, for fear of cutting off some of the blood supply to the latter near the mesenteric Fig. 1731. attachment. All bleeding points in the mesentery are ligated with :atgut. In dividing the intestine with scissors, the line of incision should be well away from the necrotic tissue (Fig. 1731). The cavity of the gut from the tapes to the opening should be carefully emptied of all matter and thoroughly washed out with hot boric-acid solution for dis- infection. The edges of the divided mesentery are united by interrupted sutures of fine silk, or of catgut which is known to be thoroughly steril- ized. In uniting the ends of the divided gut it is advisable to use two forms of suture: (1) That which includes the mucous membrane alone (Czerny’s suture); (2) that which includes the peritoneal coat alone (Lembert’s suture). In Fig. 1733, which represents a longitudinal sec- tion through the ends to be approximated, the Czerny suture is shown at b, as it is passed through the mucous layer of the intestine from the inner surface of the canal; while at a, the method of introducing the Lembert suture through the peritoneal layer is shown.

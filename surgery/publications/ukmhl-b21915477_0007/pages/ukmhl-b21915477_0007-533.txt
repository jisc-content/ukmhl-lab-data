HYDATID DISEASE OF THE BONES. 473 Hydatids of bone probably occur much oftener than statistics would indicate, because they usually receive but passing notice in works on surgery, and are not even men- tioned in some well-known works on pathology. They are chiefly to be distinguished from cancer, syphilis, sarcoma, and tubercu- losis. In cancer there is usually cachexia and often multiple manifestations; cancer of the bones is rarely found without other unmistakable manifesta- tions of cancer. In syphilis of the bones there is usually a dis- tinct history, an obvious involve- ment of the cortical portion of the bones, with, in most cases, pain (osteocopic pains) occurring in the course of the development of the disorder. In sarcoma there is usually a much more rapid develop- ment, and a very distinct tume- faction of the bone, with an absence of fluctuation. These characteristics make the diag- nosis, if once the idea of hydatid is entertained, comparatively easy. Certainty is assured by the examination of the contents of the cysts, which, except when pus is formed, are of a transpa- rent character, often almost col- orless, sometimes straw color, and often containing hooklets which are unmistakable when seen under the microscope. A spontaneous fracture of a bone occurring in an apparently healthy per- son, should always lead to a suspicion that a hydatid may be present. Fig. 1634. Human Femur, Tibia, and Fibula. Fig. 1633. Human Tibia. Diagnosis. â€” The most Flg' ' likely source of error in re- gard to the diagnosis of hydatids of the bones is tuberculosis. The cold ab- scesses of this disease may present a close resemblance to the fluctuating swellings caused by the formation of a hydatid cyst in the soft parts connected with the parent cyst in a bone; and T , it has even happened to Ollier to see a case in which a hydatid cyst was found in the same pa- tient on whom he had formerly operated for tuberculous disease of a

207 SPECIAL AMPUTATIONS. Amputation at the Hip-Joint.—At the time that the Article on Amputations in the first volume of this work was published, the best mode known to the profession for controlling hemorrhage during hip- joint amputation was the use of the aortic compressor, the disadvan- tages of which were, however, fully recognized. Since that period many plans have been devised for accomplishing the purpose, old sug- gestions have been modified and variously combined, and in the hands of surgeons of the present day compression of the aorta has been almost entirely replaced by what is known as the “bloodless method,” intro- duced by Professor Wyeth, of New York, which consists in the applica- tion very high up of an Esmarch’s tube, kept in position by steel mat- tress-needles or skewers made to transfix the thigh on either side of the articulation. As first practised by its introducer, this mode of controlling the bleeding necessitated an operation a deux temps, the limb being first amputated in the continuity of the thigh, and the upper end of the femur subsequently disarticulated after ligation of the vessels, and this double operation was necessarily so prolonged that the patient some- times perished from that cause alone; but by placing the transfixing skewers at a higher point, it is now found possible to complete the dis- articulation before removing the constricting tube or band, and thus a source of grave danger is avoided. It is interesting to trace the development of this method, the adop- tion of which seems to me to be the greatest improvement in hip-joint amputation which has been effected during the last decade. Nearly thirty years ago, I was present when the late Dr. Addinell Hew- son amputated at the hip, an effort being made to prevent bleeding by the use of a strong acupressure pin passed below the femoral vessels, ac- cording to Simpson’s first method, and reinforced by pressure of the thumbs of an assistant, who held an end of the pin in either hand and compressed the artery directly upon it; at the most critical moment the pin broke, and though the operator skilfully caught the vessel in the flap, so much blood was lost that the patient never rallied. About fifteen years later, in 1880, Newman and Trendelenburg advocated the employment of a steel rod made to transfix the limb below the vessels, which were then compressed upon it by a bar, or by an elastic cord passed in figure-of-eight turns around its ends; the flap was then cut, the vessels tied, disarticulation effected, and the tissues on the back of the limb finally compressed and dealt with in the same manner. Furneaux Jordan’s method, about which much misunderstanding prevails among surgical writers, consisted in beginning the operation as for an excision of the head of the femur; after disarticulation, the shaft was dissected out through a longitudinal incision on the outer side of the limb, and finally the soft tissues were constricted by means of an elastic band and then cut through at a lower point. Professor Senn has modified and improved this procedure by perforating the tissues on the inner side of the thigh after enucleating the upper por- tion of the femur, introducing a double elastic tube, tying one part over the anterior tissues, crossing the other posteriorly, and finally bringing it around the whole limb and securing it in front, thus doubly con- stricting the great vessels. The limb is then removed by cutting a long anterior and a short posterior flap. Various combinations of

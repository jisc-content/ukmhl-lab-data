PREFACE. VI expressed in the other articles the entire responsibility rests with their respective authors. The illustrations which have been inserted are such as it is believed will really serve to elucidate the text, but none have been included for mere pictorial effect. The thanks of the editor are due to the trustees of the Fiske Prize Fund for permission to use a number of cuts illustra- tive of the Article on Diseases of the Joints.

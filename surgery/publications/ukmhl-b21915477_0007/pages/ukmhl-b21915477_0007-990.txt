930 URINARY CALCULUS. published and unpublished. And to this I may add Freyer’s table of 987 Indian cases, which Cabot also has. A tabular presentation of these statistics is interesting as showing the results of operations before and after 1878. The tabular comparison, however, cannot be quite accurate, as some of the tables are in decades and others in broken groups as to age; but I have tried to generalize them suffi- ciently for comparison as occurring before and after the date 1878, the time since which modern antiseptic methods may be said to have pre- vailed.

These new ones, and particularly their tabular comparison, must show, if anything ever is shown by general statistics, three things most prominently: I. That modern lateral lithotomy statistics are better than ancient ones, due doubtless to (a) selection of cases, (6) antiseptic methods (internal and external), and (c) better operative technique as regards hemorrhage and irrigation. II. That the suprapubic method is totally unfit for children (a reserve being made for very large stones), the mortality being more than four times as high as for the lateral operation—the mortality, indeed, rank- ing quite as high as for middle life when the suprapubic operation is resorted to—while in old age the statistics of this operation have not improved over its old showing given in my first article, as being, at an all around average, about thirty per cent. Cabot makes it 32.07 per cent. Although the number of his collected cases is small, out of his total collection at all ages (744 cases) the mortality is about nineteen per cent. A man therefore who manages to save more than three cases out of four by the high operation after the age of fifty, does very well. My own suprapubic operations for stone (leaving out the first three by the old method, which were recorded in my first article) have given me a mortality of ten per cent.—that is, one death in ten cases. Two of my patients were between the ages of forty and fifty, the rest over fifty. Five of the cases were complicated by prosta- tectomy, and among these one died. 1 Cabot’s cases of old men (only 48 in number) are too few for much reliance to be placed upon them ; the showing is very good, however, for the possibilities of lateral lithotomy m late life.

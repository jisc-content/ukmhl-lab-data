1019 ANTERIOR COLPORRHAPIIIA. that silver sutures are employed, when really silkworm gut is the proper material. The following illustrations from Pozzi’s work will assist in understand- Fig. 1763.

Anterior Colporrhaphia. Under this head the only recent operation that will be presented is Winckel’s. Professor Winckel,1 in giving his reasons for dissatisfaction with the old methods, remarks that the vesico-vaginal septum becomes thinner in the aged from decrease of fatty tissue, and that, as we cut out a large piece from the anterior vaginal wall, and stretch the lateral parts over this denuded portion, we do not increase the thickness, but make the wall less resistant; he has seen too, after Sims’s operation, obsti- nate vesical disease in a patient, possibly from some of the stitches having penetrated the bladder. He has been led therefore to devise a new method, against which such objections cannot be made. This method is as follows: A sufficiently large oval is cut by the scalpel, and a flap is then dissected outward in the vesico-vaginal wall on each side. Fig. 1765 represents the first incision, and the partial dissection of the flap. After the completion of the flaps, three or four- silkworm-gut sutures are used to unite that of one side to that of the other, and then complete union is effected with the continuous catgut suture. The oval is thus completely covered. (Fig. 1766.) This operation is comparatively bloodless, is easily done, and the re- sults have been quite satisfactory. I can commend the method, not only from knowing what Dr. Winckel has accomplished with it, hut also from having myself employed it. 1 Munch, med. Wochenschrift, 1891.

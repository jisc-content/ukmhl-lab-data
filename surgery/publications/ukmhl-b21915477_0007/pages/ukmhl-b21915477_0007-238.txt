182 ANESTHETICS AND ANESTHESIA. Mortality from Anesthetics. In addition to the statistics given by Lyman, in Vol. I., it may be said that Hunter McGuire 1 states that he saw 28,000 chloroform adminis- trations during the War of the Rebellion, without a death, and that Lawrie2 reports 45,000 administrations, also without a death. T. Brown Henderson,3 on the other hand, gives the statistics from St. Bartholomew's Hospital, as follows: Chloroform, 12 deaths in 17,660 administrations (1 in 1472); ether, 1 in 7493; gas and ether, 1 in 12,807. Julliard4 collected 524,507 chloroform administrations, with 161 deaths (1 in 3258), and 1 death in 14,987 etherizations. Mac- ewen, Macleod, and Buchanan, of Glasgow,6 record 34,000 chloroform administrations with but three deaths (1 in 11,000), while Ollier6 re- ports 29,500 etherizations without a single fatal result. Gurlt,7 of Berlin, reported to the last German Surgical Congress the statistics from 62 operators, showing 109,196 cases of anaesthesia, with 39 deaths, or an average of 1 in 2800, divided as follows: Chloroform, 94,123, with 36 deaths (1 in 2614); ether, 9431, without a death; ether and chloro- form, 2891, with one death; ether and alcohol, 1381, with no death; bromoform with ethyl-bromide, 2151, with one death; pental, 210, with one death. In the Medical News of October 29, 1892, an extensive array of statistics is presented, comprising reports from 42 sources and show- ing 638,461 administrations of chloroform, with 170 deaths (1 in 3749), and 300,157 etherizations, with 18 deaths (1 in 16,675). It isalso re- ported that Dr. Rahotz has administered ether 150,000 times, without any death. Several deaths and a large number of cases which presented serious symptoms have occurred from the hypodermic use of cocaine. It should be noted that the reports of McGuire, Nussbaum,8 and Law- rie, comprising 113,000 chloroformizations without a single death, were, in the first and second instances, of administrations in military practice, which should be received with some reserve, as it is very diffi- cult to fairly weigh all the causes of fatal results under such circum- stances, while in the last instance they were in a hot, dry climate, under conditions most propitious for the safe administration of chloro- form. Statistics compiled, as has been the custom, from so many sources, are at best unreliable, and since but a comparatively small pro- portion of the deaths and even a smaller proportion of the administrations are ever recorded, their practical uselessness is apparent. To be of value, the cases for the administration of the different agents should be carefully selected, and the anaesthetic should be used by skilled and unbiased operators. Even then it should he remembered that the results will naturally vary considerably. The Scotch and German statistics are undoubtedly the most reliable at hand, and the difference in the ratios given is probably best accounted for by different methods of administra- tion. We are informed that the Germans are given to pushing chloro- form narcosis, which may account for their high mortality rate; while the ratio of the leading Scotch surgeons (1 in 11,000) was doubtlessly 1 Journal Amer.

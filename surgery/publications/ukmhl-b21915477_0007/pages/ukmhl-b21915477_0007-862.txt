INTUBATION OF THE LARYNX. 802 with the end of the finger resting against the epiglottis, the handle of the instrument should be raised as this is pushed downward and forward into the larynx, and as it sinks into the larynx the finger is placed upon the head of the tube to fix it, and prevent its withdrawal when the obturator is removed. As soon as the tube has been pushed well down into the larynx respiration ceases, and further manipulations should be made with as much speed as possible; the trigger should be pressed to disengage the obturator and introducer from the tube, which is fixed in the larynx by the tip of the finger as before described. The introducer and obturator are now withdrawn from the mouth by depressing the handle of the instrument upon the chest, and before the finger is re- moved from the mouth the tube should again be pressed well down into the larynx. No great amount of force should be employed in pressing the tube down after it engages in the larynx; I think it may be given as a safe rule of practice, that no more force should be used than would be justi- fiable in passing a catheter or bougie into the urethra. If it is found that the intubation-tube is too large to be passed into the larynx with- out the exercise of considerable force, it should he withdrawn, and a smaller one should be attached to the instrument and introduced. Usually, as soon as the obturator has been removed, the child makes a deep inspiration, and at the first expiratory effort there is commonly coughed up false membrane or muco-purulent matter, and when the tube has been cleared of this the respiration is carried on quietly; if, however, upon the withdrawal of the obturator, the dyspnoea is not relieved by the expirator}r efforts of the patient, the tube should be speedily removed by traction upon the thread and examined, and if it is found that no mass of membrane is occluding it, the canal being clear, and that dyspnoea is still present, it is evident that the obstruc- tion exists below the point to which the intubation-tube extended. Under such circumstances it is not likely that a second introduction would afford relief, and it is better to make no further attempt to in- troduce the tube, but to resort to tracheotomy. If, on the other hand, the respiration is carried on satisfactorily, before the mouth-gag is re- moved the index finger of the left hand should be introduced and carried back to feel that the tube is in place, and has not been disturbed by the expiratory efforts of the child. Some diversity of practice exists among operators as to the dis- position of the silken thread which is attached to the intubation-tube; some operators as soon as the tube is properly placed and the patient is breathing comfortably, divide the loop of silken thread, and with the finger resting upon the head of the tube, pull upon the end of the loop and withdraw it; this is done to prevent the irritation of the fauces which the thread sometimes causes, and to prevent the patient from seizing it and displacing the tube. Other operators prefer to retain the thread in place for some hours or days, so that the loop can be brought out of the mouth and secured around the ear, and can be used to remove the tube, by traction upon it, in case it should become blocked with membrane and is not coughed out by the patient. To prevent the irritation of the fauces and the gagging which the thread sometimes causes, it has been suggested that it should be passed through the pos- terior nares, and be brought out anteriorly and secured around the ear,

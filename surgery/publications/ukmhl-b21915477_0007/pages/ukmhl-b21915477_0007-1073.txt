1013 symphyseotomy; division op the symphysis pubis. back to the year 1777; and its life has been by common consent divided into three more or less active and successful periods. The first period extends from 1777 to 1860 inclusive; the second from 1865 to 1885 inclusive; and the third from 1886 to the present time. A careful study of the progress of the operation and its varying degrees of suc- cess will show why these periodical divisions have been thought desirable. The First Period.â€”The record of the eighty-four years of this period has been repeatedly hunted up, and particularly so within the last twelve years, since it became evident that antiseptic measures were about to work a revolution in the results of the operation. I thought I had done well in 1883 to search out 70 cases and report them chrono- logically; but the combined investigations of Morisani of Naples, Franz L. Neugebauer of Warsaw, and myself, since that date, and par- ticularly in 1892 and 1893, have made it evident that the 84 years should be credited with at least 150 cases, the results of many of which are not upon record. We have, however, dug out of the obscurity of the past 114 operations, of which 72 ended more or less favorably; at least the women did not die, although many suffered from various discomforts, while 41 children are enumerated as having been saved and 72 lost. This method of delivery grew rapidly into favor for ex- perimental practice, and again lost favor, when its results became known. In its first year there was, as far as we now know, 1 opera- tion; in its second there were 16; and 16 collectively in the next four years. Six women lost out of 16, and 12 children, in 1778, put at once a check upon its favorable reception; and its enthusiastic laudation on the part of Sigault and Leroy failed of the desired effect: 40 per cent, of deaths for the mothers and 75 percent, for the children was not what had been anticipated. Under the first 50 operations, 17 women and 32 children, or 34 and 64 per cent., respectively, were lost. This period closed with the year 1860, and the number of operations year by year diminished until the average was not even one per annum. The Second Period began in 1865, after there had not been a symphy- seotomy performed in any part of the world during five years. There had been only one case in Great Britain during the first period, and not one in the United States. In the second period (1865-1885 inclus- ive) the operation was confined to Italy with two exceptions, where it was done in the United States, and of the 75 cases, 71 belonged to Naples. The revived operation in Naples began in 1866, and was carried on with few exceptions by Profs. Ottavio Morisani and Kaf- faele Novi, who reintroduced it after an interval of seven and one- half years (July 25, 1858, to January 5, 1866). By great care in the management of their cases the Neapolitan operators managed to save 40 women and 41 children as the result of their first 50 operations, and to avoid the production of any pelvic lesions as sequelie of deliv- ery. All of the 50 women had been the subjects of rickets, and about three out of four of them were delivered without the aid of forceps. Version was only resorted to in cases of transverse position. The pubic sections all were made from within outward and below upward, by the probe-pointed and sickle-shaped bistoury of Galbiati. Of the whole 75 operations of the second period 21 were fatal, and 17 children were lost. The Third Period began with January, 1886, and the operations

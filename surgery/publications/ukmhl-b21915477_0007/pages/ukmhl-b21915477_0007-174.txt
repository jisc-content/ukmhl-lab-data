118 POISONED WOUNDS. fore her admission noticed a small pimple on the left forearm; this rapidly grew worse, and was surrounded by a group of little pustules. She was very ill, and died in about thirty-six hours. Anthrax-bacilli were found in abundance in the pus, and in her blood after death. No clear history of the case could be obtained; nor did it appear that any other persons working with her had been similarly affected. Burrell has given 1 a very full report of a case of anthrax in a man 44 years of age, successfully treated by excision of the lesion. The bacteriolog- ical and microscopical examinations are described, and a bibliographi- cal table is appended ; the whole paper is worthy of careful study. An- other case of successful excision has been reported by W. M. Baker,2 and seventeen cases, with four deaths, by Mr. Davies-Colley.3 Insect-Stings. Mention is made by Surgeon-Major E. R. Johnson4 of an insect called the “pipsee fly,” by the stings of which so many men were laid up that an order was issued for the wearing of boots and a protective dress. It is said to be smaller than a mosquito, and noiseless; it attacks the hands and feet, giving no pain at the time, but causing subsequently a conical elevation capped by a red blister, which soon becomes of a deep purple-black; the itching lasts for many days. A case is quoted from Paltauf5 in which a woman, aged 30, was stung by a fly on the right eyelid; the next day there was local inflammation, with cerebral symp- toms, followed by collapse and death. It is stated 6 that a surgeon in the East Indian Civil Service, while on a tiger-hunt, was attacked by hornets, and received over two hundred stings; erysipelas ensued, and proved fatal. Such injuries would appear to involve special risk when inflicted on the head or neck. Thus fatal results are reported from a bee-sting on the forehead;7 on the eyelid;9 from a wasp-sting on the side of the neck,9 death occurring on the ninth day. Newton 111 records the occur- rence of alarming symptoms from the sting of a honey-bee in the facial vein; and another, in the upper part of the side of the neck of a healthy girl, aged 22, is said by Hocker 11 to have produced like effects. A sin- gular case is reported by Uhthoff 12 in which a man about 40 years old was stung “on the right eye” by a “wasp-fly.” There was swelling and loss of sight on the third day; the perception of light gradually returned, and a week later the sight is said to have been much im- proved. Nothing was revealed by ophthalmoscopic examination. A case of death from a wasp-sting is recorded,13 in which it is said that a Mr. Day, M.R.C.S., ascribed the fatal result to syncope from the pain. Alarming collapse was observed by Thomas 14 in a man aged 56, stung on the middle finger by a wasp. 1 Trans. American Surgical Association, vol. xi., 1893. 2 Brit. Med. Journ., June 14, 1884. 3 Med.

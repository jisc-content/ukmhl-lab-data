THE CiESAREAN OPERATION; PUERPERAL CCELIO-HYSTEROTOMY. 1011 safest work of the world has been accomplished by the deep and super- ficial suturing, 10 or 12 stitches in each row being sufficient to accomplish the purposes of the method. Where the operation is per- formed before labor, or where labor has existed but a very short time, multiple suturing may not be required; but it is safer to secure the wound against the danger of post-partum relaxation and leakage. The possibilities of Ccesarean delivery in saving mothers and children are most encouragingly demonstrated by the operations in the cities of Leipsic and Dresden, where the mortality in 100 cases has been 7 women and 3 children. The record of Leipsic up to August, 1893, was 55 operations—3 women and 3 children lost. The fatal cases were, in order, Nos. 10, 28, and 37. Prof. Max Sanger saved all of his thirteen patients, and all of their children but the first, which had been some time dead. The Dresden record is to July 25, 1893, and comprises 45 cases with 4 deaths, all of the children being delivered alive. It begins with May 25, 1882. Patient No. 4 died on the fifth day of peritonitis; No. 15 on the third day of oedema of the lungs; No. 27 on the fifth day; and No. 34 on the fourth day, the latter of general peritonitis and oedema of the lungs. Prof. Schauta’s Clinic of the General Hospital of Vienna, from Nov. 7, 1889, to July 25, 1893, gives a record of 30 Caesarean deliveries, with 4 women lost and all of the children delivered alive. Patient No. 9 died of marasmus and bronchitis; No. 15 of eclampsia; No. 18 of en- dometritis and peritonitis, after “ castration for osteomalaciaand No. 26 of ileus, after her second Caesarean delivery. Dr. Murdoch Cameron, of Glasgow, reported 30 Caesarean operations performed by himself, up to July 6, 1893, with 27 recoveries. Here we have collectively, from three countries and four localities, 160 Caesarean operations, by a number of obstetric surgeons, with 14 deaths of women, or less than 9 per cent. There were eight opera- tors in charge of the cases in both Leipsic and Vienna, and they aver- aged one death in twelve. We have a very different picture to present from the Caesarean record of the United States. Some time ago we felt encouraged by the results of American work, as it appeared from the table in hand; but very recent private communications have materially altered the percentage of women saved. Our large cities, and particularly their maternity hospitals, are reducing their rate of death ; but the same cannot be said for the results in private practice, where many women are brought under the knife in an unfavorable condition, and must almost neces- sarily die. During the eleven years following the introduction of the Sanger method and its modifications, in October, 1882, there were 88 operations in the United States, with a loss of 35 women and 16 chil- dren. In the years 1890-’91-’92 and ’93, there were 50 of these opera- tions, with 14 women, or 28 per cent., and 10 children, or 20 per cent., lost. In the maximum year, 1890, there were 17 operations, with a loss of 4 women and 1 child. In the next 22 months, up to Nov. 1, 1893, there were 22 operations, with 6 women and 5 children lost, a mortality for the women of 27T3T per cent. We may rate our present mortality at about 28 percent., which is far higher than it ought to be, and would be, if the women were all operated upon in proper sea- son. The fatality of the operation largely depends upon the condition

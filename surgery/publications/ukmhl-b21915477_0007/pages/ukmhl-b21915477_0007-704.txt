644 SURGICAL DISEASES OF TIIE HEAD. Hemorrhage into the Lateral Ventricle.—Dennis1 removed a clot in a patient aged 36 years, who had received a blow on the head and was trephined six hours after the accident. No clot being found, either outside or under the dura or in the brain substance, an incision wras made directly into the ventricle, when a clot about the size of a pullet's egg shot out with such force as to fall several feet away from the patient’s head. Death followed, however, in three days, as a result of the great laceration of the cerebral substance. The ventricles have also been ruptured in cases of compound fracture, two such cases at least having been recorded, both ending in recoverey. Of secondary rupture of the ventricles quite a large number of cases are now on record, and in over one-half recovery has followed surgical treatment. In my paper before the International Congress I called at- tention to five cases of rupture of the lateral ventricles from simple fracture, all in young children, and three terminating favorably. In such cases as a rule no operative interference should be attempted un- less threatening symptoms supervene. 1 New York Med. Journal, 1892, vol. lxvi., p. 701.

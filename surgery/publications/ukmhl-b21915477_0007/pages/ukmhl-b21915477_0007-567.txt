To the leg is ap- plied an adhesive-plaster extension apparatus, such as would be used in the Buck bed extension, and this is fastened to a windlass on the foot-piece of the splint. When this windlass is wound up traction is made upon the leg, and if the pelvic band is provided with stout perineal straps, traction comes di- rectly upon the hip joint. The splint is one which can be made by any blacksmith, and de- mands no nicety of construction. The forms most commonly used are shown in the annexed illustra- tions (Figs. 1649 to 1654).

The perineal bands should pass under the tuberosity of the ischi- um, and are most conveniently made of .leather, or of webbing covered with canton flannel. I have de- scribed a cheap hip splint made of gas-pipe,1 which can be construct- ed for one or two dol- lars, and in which trac- tion is made by leather straps attached to the flat foot-piece instead of by the windlass; the splint is fairly efficient, although inferior to any splint in which the windlass is employed. (Fig. 1655.) It need hardly be added that the efficiency of the apparatus de- pends upon the nicety of its adjustment, 1 Boston Med. and Surg. Journ.. March 12, 1891.

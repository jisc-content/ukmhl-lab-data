( 575 ) SURGICAL DISEASES OF THE HEAD. BY W. W. KEEN, M.D., LL.D., PROFESSOR OF THE PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY AND OF CLINICAL SURGERY IN THE JEFFERSON MEDICAL COLLEGE; SURGEON TO THE JEFFERSON MEDICAL COLLEGE HOSPITAL AND TO THE ORTHOPAEDIC HOSPITAL AND INFIRMARY' FOR NERVOUS DISEASES; CONSULTING SURGEON TO ST. AGNES’S HOSPITAL AND TO THE WOMAN’S HOSPITAL, PHILADELPHIA; MEMBRE COR- RESPONDENT Stranger de la societe DE CHIRURGIE DE PARIS, ETC. Since the earlier volumes of this Encyclopaedia were published, itm mense progress has been made in the surgery of both the central and the peripheral'nervous system. In this article I shall consider only the surgery of the brain, exclusive of traumatisms. As long ago as 1871, Broca located a cerebral abscess in the speech centre; but modern brain surgery really begins with the modest re- port of a case by Macewen in 1879,1 and with a subsequent paper by the same author in 1881.2 These publications unfortunately, however, at- tracted but little attention, and surgeons were blind to the opportuni- ties for a great advance until Dr. Hughes Bennett and Mr. Godlee3 narrated a case of sub-cortical tumor of the brain diagnosticated by localizing symptoms alone, and successfully removed. In October, 1S86, and April, 1887, Mr. Victor Horsley published4 two most im- portant papers, which had a most important influence both in establish- ing the proper technique of operations upon the brain, and in diffusing a knowledge of its possibilities. In America, Roberts, Amidon, Seguin and Weir, Starr, McBurney, and myself, besides many others, have published numerous articles, which will be utilized in the following pages. In Germany the most elaborate and important paper is von Bergmann’s “ Cliirurgische Behandlung von Hirnkrankheiten.” 5 In France Lucas Championniere, Chipault, and others have published a number of excellent papers. One fact should be especially noticed: that all of this practical pro- : gress would have been impossible had it not been for the quiet but persistent scientific work in laboratories, especially in Germany and England, by Fritscli and Hitzig, Ferrier and Horsley, and many other co-workers. No better argument could be adduced to prove the actual practical value of such scientific laboratory work, and no better induce- ment could be held out to American and other philanthropists for pro- viding such means of research by ample endowments. ■ 1 Glasgow Medical Journal, 1879. 2 Lancet, 1881, vol. ii., p. 541. 3 Ibid., Dec. 20, 1884. 4British Med.

SELECTION OF A METHOD OF RADICAL TREATMENT. 929 parative statistics of operations by different methods in the hands of a single, not a number of operators. Dittel's figures 1 are to the point:— Number. Cured. Improved. Died. Mortality. Lithotrity ... 178 148 7 23 12.92 per cent. Litholapaxy 192 179 1 12 6.25 Lateral Cystotomy 65 39 1 25 38.46 “ Median “ 40 20 1 19 47.50 Suprapubic “ 26 13‘ 1 12 46.54 Sir Henry Thompson, in reporting his statistics of 964 cases of opera- tion for stone," concludes, after comparing litholapaxy with the old operation, that the former procedure has reduced his mortality in crushing to nearly one-half. This testimony is hardly needed at the present day to accentuate the value of litholapaxy as compared with the old-fashioned crushing operation, yet it is refreshing to give it, if only in the way of repeating a known fact. Besides the cases already alluded to, as reported by Surgeon-Major Freyer, 165 more cases appeared at a later date over his name with 3 deaths; these I have referred to in my digest on the subject in the annual already referred to.3 To speak for France is to refer to Professor Felix Guyon, whose strong advocacy of litholapaxy is a matter of historical record. This gentle- man advocates many sittings, rather than one, in the case of atony of the bladder with phosphatic stone, since, as he avers, the washing-bottle does not seem to attract the fragments in these atonied bladders at a distance greater than an inch from its eye, wherefore he thinks a number of sittings may do the work more effectually than one very prolonged operation. He advises the use of a 1-500 solution of nitrate of silver, before and after each sitting, for its antiseptic value. No better statistics exist than those of our own countryman, George Chismore, of San Francisco, who in November, 1892, had had sixty- three consecutive litholapaxies without a death. Most of these were published in the Journal of Cutaneous and Genito-Urinary Diseases for August, 1890, and October, 1892. This question of statistics as bearing upon the present status of the results, and therefore influencing the choice of operation in a given case, is so important that it will bear considerable amplification and elaboration. I have been favored by Dr. A. T. Cabot, of Boston, with some modern statistics which he has collected from various sources for an article of his own upon urinary calculus. These statistics were gathered together to show the present mortality status of the various operations, and are interesting as indicating the present improvement in lithotomy—an improvement due doubtless in a measure to modern antiseptic methods and to better modern means of controlling hemorrhage. In my former article I tried to present the general mortality status of perineal lithotomy when estimated according to that most important factor, the patient’s age, and I did this by presenting the table accord- ing to decades as given by Coulson from a collection of 2972 cases, and by Thompson from an analysis of 1827 cases. Now I add Cabot’s collec- tion of 6.74 modern cases since 1878, gathered from various sources, 1 Wien. med.

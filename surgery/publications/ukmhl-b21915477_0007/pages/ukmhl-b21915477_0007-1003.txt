This ure- throscope is very convenient, the one objec- tion to it being its weight. (Fig. 1753.) W. K. Otis,1 in 1891, produced a modifi- cation of Leiter’s instrument, doing away with much of the objectionable weight. This instrument was composed of a small concave mirror attached by means of a rigid wire to the periphery of the disk at the ocular end of the urethral tube, the small incandescent lamp being secured to the wire at a convenient distance from the mirror. Otis soon improved on this,2 making what he calls “ The Perfected Ure- throscope,” in which the light, instead of being reflected from a mirror, is condensed by passing through a lens. In a metal tube or cylinder, 1-jf inches in length and one-half inch in diameter, one end of which is closed while into the other is inserted a plano-convex lens, is introduced through a tube or elbow on the lower side, and near to the closed end, the small in- candescent lamp. The handle of the instrument is small, consisting of a piece of hard rubber one inch in length by one-half inch in width. The current is controlled by a thumb-screw switch on the side of the handle. This illuminator is connected to the urethral tube by a piece of stiff wire 1£ inches long, a hinged joint being at either end. For this instrument are claimed: the exclusion of extraneous light, a more ready access to Leiter’s Urethroscope. Fig. 1754. W. K.

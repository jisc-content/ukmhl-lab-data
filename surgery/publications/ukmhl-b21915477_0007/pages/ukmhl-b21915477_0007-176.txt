POISONED WOUNDS. 120 die in a short time in convulsions. Two fatal cases, in adults, are re- ported by O’Hara.1 On the other hand, Banerjie2 records forty-six cases, all of which ended in recovery; he recommends the local use of chloroform, chloral, or chloral and camphor. Poredi3 says that co- caine by injection gives relief, localizing the pain. It may be mentioned here that Ricord4 has employed the peroxide of hydrogen with success in a case of hornet-sting, and suggests its trial in other cases of animal poisoning. By Briggs5 the “bugle-weed” (Lycopus virginicus) is said to have been used with success in a case of centipede-bite, as well as in other instances of poisoning by insect- stings. Wounds by Poisoned Arrows. White6 has reported the case of a servant-girl accidentally wounded by a poisoned arrow kept with some other weapons. The prominent symptoms were failure of circulation and respiration ; and the poison was thought to be curara. Stanley is said 7 to have found that the natives of the Lower Congo district used the powder of dried red ants, mixed with palm-oil, for poisoning their arrows. It is stated that the wounds produced had ter- minated fatally “directly.” By the Akas,8 a brown paste, chiefly composed of the root of Aconi- tum ferox, is used. Three cases are reported, two ending fatally in a few hours, the third followed by slow convalescence. The people of the country, an Indian district near Bhootan, had an aromatic bark (from a species of laurel) which they said was an antidote when chewed. Snake-Bites. The reader who wishes to possess himself of the existing information in regard to snake-venom will find a good history of the earlier re- searches made on this subject in an article by Fletcher;9 Brunton 10 has written on snake-venom and its antidotes. Cobra-poison has been studied and experimented with by Aron,11 by Kanthack,12 by Ragotzi,13 and by Wolfenden.11 Reference may also be made to some further investigations on snake-poison by Sir Joseph Fayrer.15 The poison of the copperhead has been experimented with in this country by Ott.16 But the most satisfactory results have perhaps been attained by Mitchell and Reichert17 in their investigation of the poison of rattlesnakes and copperheads. They have been able to determine the existence in the venom of three proteid principles, which they call venom-peptone, venom- globulin, and venom-albumin. Of these the globulin is the most in- tensely poisonous, the peptone being less so, while the albumin has not I Indian Med. Gazette, March, 1884. 2 Lancet, Oct. 1, 1892. 3 Indian Med.

123 SNAKE-BITES. Permanganate of Potassium.—In my former article, mention was made in a foot-note of this remedy, which has since been extensively used, and is at the present time regarded with much favor by some of the leading authorities. Richards 1 advises the use of a 5-per-cent, so- lution; Quatrefages2 regards a 1-per-cent, solution as sufficient, with ligature of the limb and kneading of the tissues about the wound. By some, the remedy has been employed internally as well as locally; thus Bories,3 in the case of a man aged 35, seen four hours after the bite of a rattlesnake in the calf of the leg, injected -j gr. into the arm, and gave gr. ij. by the mouth every hour. Barber4 reports nine cases of rat- tlesnake-bite in which the permanganate was used with success. Much testimony to its value has been afforded by observers in India.5 In some of the reported cases, other remedies have also been given, such as quinine, ammonia, or whiskey. Badaloni6 states that in experiments on animals with viper-poison, he found the permanganate inefficient. Shortt7 claimed that it was the potassium which was of real value; and recommended “saturating the system so that all the secretions are alkaline.” This view, however, is absolutely rejected by Richards. Gaston,8 * reporting a case successfully treated with permanganate locally and ammonia internail}7, claims the credit of the discovery of the former agent for Dr. Tichenor, of Baton Rouge, La. Strychnia.—This drug has recently been advocated by many Aus- tralian practitioners,1’ and by some in India. It has been given either by the mouth or hypodermically, with the obvious purpose of stimulat- ing the nervous system. It has sometimes been pushed to the extent of inducing tetanic spasms, as in cases reported by Cadge and Pratt,10 and by Reid.11 But it seems to have given favorable results in all the instances published. Banerjie 12 gives seven cases, and Thomas 13 five. In two, reported by Thwaites,14 whiskey was also administered. Other Remedies.—Darwin 15 says that he saw a man bitten by a viper (Echis carinata) successfully treated by having a number of chickens applied, one after another, by their vents to the wound. Josso 10 gave jaborandi freely to a woman bitten by a European viper; she perspired freely, and recovered, but the case does not seem to have been a grave one. Browne and Smyth 17 report from South Africa a case of cobra ( ?) bite treated successfully by the hypodermic use of morphia and am- monia. Another writer 18 doubts that the snake was a cobra. McCall10 recommends tvhiskey and a clay poultice, on the strength of two cases so treated. Hopkins,20 in the case of a colored child aged 4, bitten three times by a copperhead, gave whiskey and used a hot-water dressing, with a good result. 1 Indian Med.

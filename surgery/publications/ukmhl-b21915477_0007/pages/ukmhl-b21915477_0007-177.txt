121 SNAKE-BITES. yet been completely isolated. It is stated by these gentlemen that the poisons of the rattlesnake, copperhead, and moccasin are capable of being destroyed by bromine, iodine, bromohydric acid (33 per cent.), sodium hydrate, potassium hydrate, and potassium permanganate. In another paper 1 they set forth further studies, including one on cobra- venom, and showing that the difference in action between this and the poison of our American snakes is the result of the difference in their chemical and physiological constitution. On the subject of snakes generally, the reader will find much infor- mation in an article headed “Reptiles, Poisonous,” by Yarrow." According to some observers, fright has much to do with the gravity of many cases. Thus, Creed 3 mentions an instance of death from the bite of a non-venomous lizard; and another in which alarming symp- toms ensued upon a puncture with a splinter, mistaken by the patient for a snake-bite. Hood4 and V. Richards5 have expressed the same view. Richards6 states that a poisonous wound may always be distinguished, upon incision, by its showing a red currant-jelly-like clot. Long7 reports a fatal case of “krait” bite, in which there were no local symptoms; the patient had probably absorbed the poison into some fissure in his mouth, while sucking the wound. Several cases have been recorded in which snake-bites were very rap- idly fatal. Roberts8 states that a colored boy, 7 or 8 years old, was bit- ten on the hand, fell forward, and was again struck in the face; he was picked up, convulsed, by a man, who ran with him toward a house near by; but “the boy was dead before he had run 75 yards.” Black- wood 0 mentions a colored child, 3 years old, bitten on the eyebrow by a “yellow rattler,” and dying in ten minutes. He says that decomposi- tion set in very early, and that the blood in the child’s body was fluid. Another case, in which a Hindoo child, aged 5, succumbed in ten min- utes, is recorded by Burgess.10 Banerjie 11 saw a man die within an hour from the bite of a viper (Echis carinata). Sometimes death takes place at a remote period. Watkins 12 reports the case of a boy, 17 years old, bitten by a moccasin on the instep, who seemed to recover promptly; but about a year afterward moist gangrene of the foot and leg began, and on the fourth day ended fatally. This patient is said to have shown “an inclination to bite anything and anybody close at hand,— his bed-clothing, self, and friends.” Hemorrhages from the stomach and kidneys have been noted by Reilly 13 in a man aged 25, who died on the seventh day, and by McDon- nell 14 in a case which proved fatal in a little over three hours. Consequences of Snake-Bites.—The curious fact has been noted that there is in some of these cases a tendenc}^ to the annual recurrence of the symptoms of poisoning.

749 AFFECTION'S OF THE JAWS. ' inches; and as the improvement has now continued for six years, it may he regarded as permanent. In anchylosis of the temporo-maxillary articulation I have also obtained good results, in a number of cases, by section of the ramus of the jaw and removal of both coronoid and condyloid processes, thus affording ample room for the formation of a false joint. The operation is performed through the mouth by passing a tenotome beneath the masseter muscle, making an opening through which an Adams saw is carried and the bone is divided. An effort is then made by seizing the upper fragment with the lion-jawed forceps, to twist it out of place. If this movement does not succeed, a chisel is placed in the wound over the neck of the condyle, and this portion is cut through, sufficient hone being gouged out of the glenoid fossa to give space. The anterior portion of the upper fragment, with the coronoid process, may he re- moved with cutting pliers, the attachment of the temporal muscle being severed by a blunt-pointed knife. In every instance in which this method has been employed a permanent and fully movable false joint has been established, permitting opening of the mouth to the normal extent, and without any lateral deviation of the lower jaw.

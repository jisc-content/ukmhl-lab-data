938 URINARY CALCULUS. not below the pubic symphysis; and from this limit I personally should be willing to cut off the last quarter of an inch. The Suprapubic Operation.—The longitudinal incision in this opera- tion is still adhered to, excepting in a few instances where the compli- cation of a tumor makes the transverse opening preferable. The question of suturing the entire wound is an open one. It probably will be done more often in the future than it has been in the past, and there is no legitimate objection to it if it be properly done; and certainly if union of the wound is effected, it hastens the getting up of the patient. Most surgeons, however, only partially close the bladder, and insert one or two drainage-tubes, or leave it entirely open. The use of the Petersen bag with very moderate distention, say five or six ounces, does not seem to increase the danger of the operation, but it is unnecessary and I have discarded it. The same may be said about the distention of the bladder, five or eight ounces of fluid being usually found enough. Of course, in some thin-walled flabby bladders a considerably greater amount of fluid may be thrown in, when it goes easily, but a competent operator can do as well with from five to eight ounces in the bladder as with a greater amount. Many of the instruments pictured and described in my former arti- cle may now be relegated to dusty cabinets. Such are the litliotome cache, the rectangular staff, the eclateurs, and various perineal stone crushers, the gorgets, and some others. The armamentarium of the lithotomist has been simplified in modern surgery rather than made more complicated. After-Treatment.—The after-treatment of all these operations is much the same as it was ten years ago, more scrupulous attention, however, being now given than formerly to drainage, irrigation, and surgical cleanliness, and with proportionately better results.

Of the two patients still under treatment when the table in Yol. III., page 612, was printed, one recovered and the other died, while of the 37 additional cases now tabulated 5 proved fatal and the result of one is undetermined; the whole 58 operations, therefore, have given 45 known recoveries and 12 deaths, a mortality in determined cases of 21 per cent. This small general mortality is still further reduced if the cases occurring in children only are considered, 51 operations in persons less than 20 years old having given 42 recoveries, 1 undetermined, and only 8 deaths (16 per cent.), and is strikingly contrasted with the death-rate which attends the operation in adults, 7 cases in persons more than 20 years of age having given only 3 recoveries and 4 deaths, over 57 per cent. Indeed, excision of the hip is such a grave proced- ure in adult life, that it should not be recommended, under these cir- cumstances, unless in very exceptional cases. I have in one case, in a girl of 17, resorted to amputation at the hip- joint subsequent to excision, caries having recurred some months after the latter operation, which had been performed with temporary benefit by my colleague Dr. Packard. The patient has recovered and im- proved much in health, though a few sinuses still persist. Amputa- tion subsequent to excision has been practised in 37 cases to which I have references, 22 ending in recovery, with 10 deaths and 5 undeter- mined, while primary amputation for hip disease appears to have been

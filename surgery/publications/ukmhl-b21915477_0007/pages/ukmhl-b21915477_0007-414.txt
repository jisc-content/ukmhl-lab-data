This latter process, the formation of a mixed thrombus, is now known to be brought about by means of the blood-plates, or plaques (Kemp), Fig. 1606. Normal Rapid Blood-Currents, Axial in Character. (Eberth and Scliimmelbusch.) the third corpuscles of the blood, first described by Donne (Osier), and identical with the haematoblasts of Hayem. If a small vein in the mesentery of an animal be watched under the microscope (Bizzozero, Eberth and Schimmelbush, Loewit), and the blood-current retain its normal velocity, a red homogeneous streak will lie observed occupying the centre of the lumen of the vessel, being the appearance produced by the blood-corpuscles in rapid motion. On Fig. 1607. Marginal Position of White Blood-Corpuscles: the Current Slower. (Eberth and Schimmelbusch.) either side of this streak, between it and the wall of the vessel, as seen through the microscope, may be observed a transparent zone of plasma, in which but one or two white blood-corpuscles appear, as they slowly roll along the walls (Fig. 1606). If the blood-current be now caused to move somewhat more slowly, the red blood-discs may be discerned moro plainly, and the white corpuscles are observed attaching themselves to the vessel-walls in greater numbers (Fig. 1607). And if the current Fig. 1608. (t Current Still Slower: Fewer White Corpuscles, a. Blood-plates in plasmatic zone. (Eberth and Schim- melbusch.) â€¢ be still more retarded, so that the shape of the red blood-corpuscles may be distinctly viewed, the leucocytes again become fewer, and among them, in the plasmatic zone and close to the vessel-wall, appear the lit- tle blood-plates (Fig. 1608, a) in great numbers; and if there be any in- jury done to the wall of the vessel, these platelets immediately collect

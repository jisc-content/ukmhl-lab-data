EXCISIONS AND RESECTIONS. 534 Male, 11, 1888 do. do. 52 Gelatinous arthritis and con- employed in 55 cases, with 42 recoveries, 11 deaths, and 2 undeter- mined ; so that, apart from the mutilation necessarily entailed by this procedure, its death-rate is hut fractionally less than that of excision, which will therefore properly be preferred in all suitable cases. Femur.—I have in one instance resected a small portion of the femoral shaft in a case of badly united fracture, fixing the fragments with a buried silver splint as advised by Dr. Halsted, of Baltimore. The patient made a good recovery, with a useful limb, the silver splint remaining in situ without causing any disturbance. Knee-Joint.—In the article on Excisions, in Yol. III., page 632, I tabulated 26 cases in which I had excised the knee-joint, and I now Table of Fifty-Eight Additional Cases of Excision of the Knee. No. Sex, age, and date.

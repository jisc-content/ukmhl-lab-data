SANGER’S OPERATION APPLIED TO DEEP PERINEAL LACERATION. 1027 Sanger’s Operation Applied to Deep Perineal Laceration. With the patient lying in the exaggerated lithotomy posture, and pre- pared for operation as already mentioned, a hand is placed upon each gluteal prominence to retract the parts forcibly, and to show the entire cicatrix back to the torn ends of the anal sphincter. Next the surgeon should note care- fully whether the recto-vaginal septum con- sists of rigid cicatricial tissue, or whether, as Sanger particularly notes, a pseudo perineum is left—a high, rigid, cicatricial wall, generally deeply placed—as the lateral cutaneous boundary. He incidentally explains that this variety is one in which the injury has involved mostly the rectum and contiguous perineum, but the vaginal surfaces scarcely at all. In the contraction which follows sec- ondary union by granulation, this vaginal surface is correspondingly retracted, and we must therefore deal with vaginal tissue and not with a perineum. This bar is best divided by the Paquelin thermo-cautery. The trans- verse incision, because of the thinness of the remaining tissue, is best made by a small scalpel. Then the anterior lateral incision is extended backward to the torn ends of the anal sphincter, so that the entire lines of incision re- sembles an H in which the posterior lateral bars are shorter than those anterior to the transverse incision. The vaginal flap is united as first .described; the rectal defect, if not Fig. 1779. Sanger's Posterior Colporrhaphy, Showing Lines of Incision. Fig. 1780. Schematic Plan for Insertion of Sutures.

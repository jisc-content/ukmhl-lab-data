Present to each eye by means of Mr. Wheatstoneâ€™s stereoscope one of two similar figures, or as a substitute for a stereoscope, hold a board (the board of an octavo book for instance) between the two eyes in front of the Fig. 189. As the circles in the above experiment arc similar, and produce equal impressions on the retinae, no alternation of the resulting sensa- tions is observable. But the impressions de- rived from the circles in No. 2, not being No. In No. 3, the line of the one circle is more strongly marked than that of the other. By looking at the two circles, in the manner above No. If, then, of similar images on correspond- ing parts of the retinae, one only, or part of the one and part of the other, are perceived at the same instant of time, we should expect a whole circle to be seen, by presenting one half of a circle to the one eye, and the other nose, and look at the circles in No. l,in such a way, that the right hand circle is seen by the right eye only, and the left hand circle by the left eye. By the instinctive motion of the eyes, the two circles soon come to fall on identical or corresponding points of the two retinae, and are then seen as one only. No. 1. quite similar, it is easy to observe that some- times the one, sometimes the other sensation is more particularly the object of perception at a given instant of time. 2. : : \ described, it will be found that the stronger excludes the weaker from being perceived. 3. half to the other, in such a way that the respective images occupy each the place of the one retina, corresponding to that of the other, which would have been occupied by the image of the absent half of the other circle, if both had been complete.

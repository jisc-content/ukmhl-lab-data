CANCER, PATHOLOGY OF. 625 with the total number living at each age. This we have been enabled to do from the population estimates of Mr. Rickman), and present the reader with the result in the following table :— TABLE II. Showing the proportion of deaths from Cancer in 1000 living of each sex at the different ages. AGES. MALES. FEMALES. MEAN.

The mortality, on the contrary, goes on steadily increasing with each succeed- ing decade until the eightieth year ; after that period the results are, from causes which it is needless to enumerate, liable to slight error, and may therefore be omitted in the general survey. It is remarkable that the mortality from this disease is lowest at the same period of life as the general mortality from all causes indiscriminately, namely frointhe tenth to the fifteenth year. The law of mortality differs strikingly in the two sexes ; the most general character of this difference being the greater regularity of increase with advancing age among males. Passing over the first twenty years, at which period the number of cases is probably too small to admit of very .useful comparison, we find, it is true, that the number of deaths from set. 30 to 40 is in both sexes about six times greater than from tet. 20 to 30 ; but here the similitude of increase ceases : in the next de- cennial period the deaths among females aug- ment more than sextuply, while the mortality of males only increases two and a half times, &c. These facts are, we trust, rendered easily comprehensible by the following diagram con- structed on the plan recently employed by Mr. Farr in demonstrating the law of mor- tality in epidemic cholera. Number is here represented by space. The fact likely to be most strongly im- pressed on the reader by this diagram is the Rickman, Population Abstracts, vol. i. Preface, • 38. Table II. was calculated by assuming as a lua* a,)nn:l^ r:ltc °f mortality from cancer in 1837, then deducing from Table I. the relative pro- portion of deaths from cancer at decennial periods of life, next ascertaining from the population re- turns the relative numbers living at those periods, and dividing the former by the latter. Thus the female deaths from cancer at the age of 20 to 30, di- vided by the number of women living at that decen- VOI.. I, enormous and abrupt increase of female mor- tality between the ages of thirty and fifty ; an increase which accounts for the erroneous notion that the disease reaches its maxi- mum frequency at that period of life, and lends support to the current belief respecting nial period gave '024 per 1000,—the relative mortality from cancer at that age. There are some other inter- mediate steps in the calculation, which it is not neces- sary to state particularly. S s

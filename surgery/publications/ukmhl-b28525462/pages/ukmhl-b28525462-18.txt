ABDOMEN. 8 other, behind the right edge of the omentum minus, at the opening called the Foramen of Winslow; and therefore there is virtually but one sac, which by reason of its arriving at the various organs, and by climbing up the vessels which supply them, assumes an arrangement which at first sight appears complex. The larger sac extends from the base of the anterior aspect of the liver (where it forms a cul de sac by its reflexion from that organ to the diaphragm), to the pelvic outlet, where it again forms one or more cul de sacs by its reflexion from the rectum to the bladder in the male,â€”and from the rectum to the va- gina, and from the uterus to the bladder, in the female. It covers the convex surface of the liver (a), and its concave surface (b), as far as the transverse fissure ; next, it forms the anterior layer of the omentum minus (e), being in front of the hepatic organs ; then it furnishes the anterior covering of the sto- mach (d), which on the left side creeps along the splenic artery to pass around the spleen, and, by its being reflected from that organ to the left crus of the diaphragm, it loosely binds it against the posterior wall; from the stomach it descends on the omental branches of the gastro-epiploic vessels, and constitutes the first or anterior layer of the omentum majus (e) ; this layer turns backward, and ascends (/) as the fourth or posterior layer (g) of the same omentum, until encountering the colon (C) crossing the abdomen, it adheres to that part (/>) which is posterior to vessels which supply it; it then passes upwards and backwards (i,k) to the spine, to which it is fixed, forming the inferior layer of the transverse meso-colon ; it again changes its direction and turns down- wards, but it is now fixed, being in front of the aorta, vena cava, and part of the third portion of the duodenum ; at an oblique line drawn from the left side of the second lum- bar vertebra towards the right iliac fossa, it ceases to be fixed, and advances on the front of the superior mesenteric vessels (/) to the je- junum and ileum (I) ; and, at the point where the vessels enter, it passes around the intes- tine (m, n) to the posterior part of the same vessels by which it is conducted to the spine, these two portions forming the suspen- sory of the small intestines, or the mesentery (l, it) ; it then descends (o) into the pelvis, where it is in a fixed state, but by tracing it from one side to the other, it will be observed that on the middle line it becomes loose, ad- vances to the posterior part of the rectum, passes around the surface of that viscus to the same point, and retires to the sacrum, con- stituting the meso-rectum, between which the internal hemorrhoidal artery insinuates itself; from this point it passes on either side attached to the walls of the pelvis, and to the posterior surface of the bladder, from the fun- dus of which it becomes continuous with the lining of the anterior parietes of the abdomen. The obliquity of the attachment of the mesentery will admit of our designating the two laminae of which it is formed, the one as the superior or right, the other as the inferior or left lamina ; the former passes to the right side on the ilio-colic, right colic, and middle colic arteries, and at the spot where their distribution to the caecum and ascending colon commences, it passes around those parts of the great intestine to the opposite side of the vessels, and it is then reflected outwardly on to the walls of the abdomen, the two laminae being termed the right colic ligament: the latter passes to the left side along the left colic and anastomosing colic arteries to the descending colon and its sigmoid flexure, where an arrangement similar to that of the right side obtains. Fig. 5. The smaller bag, that which is behind the stomach, may be considered as a pouch of the greater bag thrust through a ring behind the vessels of the liver. It extends from the base of the posterior aspect of the liver to the point where the first or anterior layer of the great omentum changes its direction, and be- comes the fourth or posterior layer. It also forms a cul de sac against the spleen, where it is bound to the left crus of the diaphragm. At its upper part it is reflected from the right crus of the diaphragm to the liver, and assists that formerly mentioned to sustain that organ ; it covers the lobulus spigelii (p) and at the posterior lip of the transverse fissure it be- comes loose, descends (q) behind the hepatic organs to the stomach, forming the posterior layer of the omentum minus ; this layer de- scends adhering to the posterior surface of the stomach (r), and by the aid of the ante- rior layer suspends that viscus from the porta of the liver; from the stomach it descends

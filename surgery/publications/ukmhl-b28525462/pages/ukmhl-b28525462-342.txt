ANUS. 332 ter ; but, on the contrary, that the major part of them are continued on the outside of the sphincter, assume a tendinous appearance as they descend, and are accumulated into numerous fasciculi, which, passing under its inferior margin, ascend on the internal surface of the sphincter (but having a less intimate connexion with it than with the mucous mem- brane), and, finally, after again becoming ob- viously muscular, are inserted into the mucous lining of the gut as high as an inch and a half or two inches above the inferior margin of the sphincter. We have endeavoured to verify these observations of the American professor in two recent dissections, but we confess that we have hitherto failed to trace the reflection of the fasciculi from without inwards, and, con- sequently, their muscular termination in the mucous membrane. Should, however, the fact turn out to be as he has laid it down, its influence in producing prolapses of the rectum would be so apparent, and that affection so readily explained, that it merits the institution of more dissections than we have been able to make ; and it is probable that in the article Rectum, we may be prepared to admit or dis- prove the assertion. The lower end of the gut thus tapered and provided with a thickened muscular coat, is received into the upper concave surface of a long elliptical muscle, in the centre of which there is a longitudinal slit. This is the cuta- neous or external sphincter, a muscle which ac- complishes the fixation of the end of the tube, by having its posterior angle attached to the point of the coccyx, and its anterior angle to that tendinous point in the perineum which is common to the sphincter behind, the acceler- atores urinae in front, the transversi perinei on each side, and the anterior fibres of the levatores ani above. In the female, its an- terior angle is attached to the sphincter vaginae. The lower edge of the internal sphincter is received on the concave surface of the cuta- neous sphincter, in such manner that the latter by the upper part of its circumference em- braces the outside of the former muscle, and by the lower blocks up the aperture to the gut, there being nearly half an inch between the slit and the point of contact of the two sphincters, and which point of contact is marked by a distinct cellular line. The rectum, with the bladder and prostate gland above it, is confined in the cavity of the pelvis, and the sphincter externus is excluded from it by a broad flat muscular septum, the pelvic surface of which is concave, the perineal convex, which, with a slight interruption to its origin at the symphysis pubis, is fixed to so much of the parietes of the pelvis as are anterior to the spinous processes of the ischia (being attached to the pelvic surface of the bodies of the pubis, and to the aponeuroses covering the obturatorcs interni, and the flat surfaces of the ischia which correspond to the acetabula) and behind, and on the median line, it is attached to, and supported by, the point of the coccyx. The narrow space which exists on each side the coccyx, between its edge and the sacro-sciatic ligament, is filled up by the ischio-coccygeus muscle. The an- terior part of this muscular platform presents an infundibuliform opening lodging the pros- tate gland and giving exit to the membran- ous portion of the urethra ; and, helow this opening, another much larger, through which the extremity of the rectum is pushed in such a manner that the fibres of the edge of the opening intermingle with those of the sphincter ani. So much of the rectum as is beneath the bladder is adherent to a cellular line which extends backwards to the os coccy- gis, and which makes the division of this sep- tum when it is described as consisting of two muscles, denominated levatores ani. At the line which indicates the fixed attach- ment ot the levatores ani, the pelvic fascia splits into three laminae. Between the first two (counting from the cavity of the pelvis) is contained the muscles just mentioned, to which the aponeuroses are firmly adherent. The pelvic lamina quits the levatores ani, and attains anteriorly the neck of the bladder, where, by reason of its being pierced by the dorsal vein of the penis, it forms the two an- terior ligaments of the bladder; more out- wardly, the sides of the prostate gland and bladder, by an upward reflexion constituting the lateral ligaments of the latter organ ; and, still more posteriorly, the sides of the rectum. The perineal lamina descends on the outside of the levatores ani degenerating in its pro- gress so as to be scarcely perceptible on the posterior part of the rectum ; anteriorly, it is confounded with the attenuated border of the triangular ligament of the urethra, is attached ; to, or rather contributes to form, the tendin- ' ous centre of the perineum, and glides be- hind or beneath the transversus perinei mus- cle to constitute the superficial fascia of the perineum; and, in its middle portion, it passes from the outer border of the external sphincter to be lost in the superficial fascia covering the buttocks. The third or exterior lamina of the pelvic fascia is of a dense and resisting character, and contains within its substance the pudic and haemorrhoidal vessels. It covers the perineal surfaces of the obturatorcs interni, binding those muscles against the obturator ligaments. Posteriorly, and on either side, it is received into the great sacro-sciatic liga- ments ; and more forward it becomes con- founded with that portion of the preceding layer which passes on the external surface of the gluteus maximus. Anteriorly, it occupies the pubic arch, is attached to the rami of the pubis and ischia (constituting the greater portion of the thickness of the triangular liga- ment) assists in forming the central tendon of the perineum in front of the rectum and above the transversus perinei, and, at the posterior border of these muscles, unites with the perineal fasciae of the levatores ani, where they arc proceeding to form the superficial

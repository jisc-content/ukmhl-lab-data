10,1 AMAUROSIS. raeter, and the remedies employed were local and general bleeding, all the varied forms of counter-irritants, cold lotions, shower-baths, mercury, purgatives, abstinence, and, in fact, all means calculated to lessen power and sub- due any acute action. He only obtained some temporary relief from headach from loss of blood, but always had it in an increased degree soon after ; otherwise, he continued gradually to get worse. When I first saw him he had amaurosis in the extent mentioned, severe occipital and cervical pain, which was con- stant ; he was giddy ; he suffered from consti- ation and dyspepsia ; he was impotent, and ad numbness and deficient power in his thighs and legs, so that he could not walk steadily without assistance, and he was incapa- ble of making any great mental exertion ; he had lost flesh considerably, was pallid, w’ith cold extremities, and had a quick, feeble, and compressible pulse; his symptoms were some- what mitigated by a nutritious meal, and by the recumbent posture. I had no doubt from these symptoms that the disease was of as- thenic character at that time, but felt some doubts as to its mode of origin or commence- ment and progress, in consequence of the uni- formity in the opinions of so many medical men of high reputation ; but a careful inquiry into the history of the case soon satisfied me that the opinions previously given and acted upon, had been formed too hastily and erro- neously. The patient, with good person, and ample means, had entered the army when young, and as opportunity occurred he in- dulged to excess in sexual intercourse—so much so, as frequently to render himself incapable of ordinary exertion for days together ; after a few years his sexual power began to decline, although the venereal appetite continued ; and he suffered from frequent nocturnal seminal discharges, when he was almost impotent in other respects ; he then begun to lose vision, objects appearing cloudy, and he experienced frequent headach and giddiness, the pain being generally about the occipital region ; from this period, under various medical ad- visers, he was almost uniformly depleted, and by degrees he acquired the melancholy train of symptoms which were present when I first saw him. I directed him to obtain apartments in a quiet situation ; to avoid all society likely to excite him ; to take exercise twice a-day in fine weather, for a short time, not so as to create fatigue ; to clothe himself warmly, and to re- cline on a sofa frequently in the day. His diet was to be nutritious, animal food at break- fast and dinner, and a moderate quantity of wine with the latter ; the meals to be taken with great regularity, to dine early, and to be careful not to distress the stomach by quan- tity of food ; he was to use a shower-bath every morning on rising, from which he had previously experienced some benefit, feeling refreshed and with more energy from it. At first I prescribed small doses of the vinum ferri, and then the sulphate of iron in sub- stance in pill; afterwards I added a small portion of sulphate of zinc to the pills ; the doses were small and frequently repeated. A few weeks after he had commenced this plan a very marked improvement took place ; the pains in the head entirely subsided, he ex- perienced very trifling giddiness, the noctur- nal seminal discharges became much less fre- quent, the dyspepsia diminished, he felt more general power and energy, and he began to discern objects about his room which he had no previous knowledge of. By a steady per- severance of more than twelve months he was perfectly restored to health and sexual power, but he only regained sufficient vision to enable him to see a large print or letter, and con- sequently to guide himself about, and to re- cognise all ordinary objects in a favourable light. Within twenty months from the time of my first seeing him he married, and is now the father of two fine children; his health has continued excellent, and his vision has, in a trifling degree, improved. I consider this as a highly interesting and instructive case, evincing the fact I have in- sisted upon as regards the error in diagnosis in these cases, and proving the necessity of care- ful and extended inquiry into the history and progress of disease. Several whom the patient consulted, I am satisfied, never would have committed such great error in diagnosis, and consequently in treatment, had they patiently gone into the history of the disease. I could mention many other cases illustra- tive of this important point. On the other hand, there is sometimes much difficulty in discriminating cases in which the amaurosis is produced by cerebral organic mischief from the asthenic cases. I shall relate two cases which will fully explain this :— A lady about forty years of age became the subject of amaurosis, nearly complete in one eye, and imperfect in the other, a few weeks after miscarriage, during which (it was stated) she lost a large quantity of blood : the amauro- sis had been rather rapid in its progress. She was brought to London after several weeks had elapsed, and she had undergone rather active treatment by cupping and mercurials principally; leeches and blisters had also been used, but the disease had advanced. I was requested to see her, and found her very pallid,with cold extremities, feeble, rather quick and compressible pulse, great despondency, and prostration ; slight strabismus existed ; the right eye-ball projected rather more than the left, and its visual power was almost gone ; the left eye retained sufficient power to dis- tinguish large objects,—the pupils were dilated and fixed; a degree of numbness and loss of muscular power affected one side of the face : she suffered from constant dull headach, which was relieved in a degree when she assumed the recumbent position. The gene- ral symptoms and non-effect of depletory treatment connected with the history of the case, especially the circumstance of large loss of red blood, gave it the character of asthenic

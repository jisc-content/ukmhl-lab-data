ANEURISM. 227 be cured by the Hunterian method of opera- ting’, notwithstanding a languid circulation had continued in the sac, along with the patholo- gical facts here mentioned, was not, however, taken into consideration by those surgeons who had advocated the propriety of adopt- ing Brasdor’s method ; on the contrary, they imagined that a ligature could not be suc- cessfully applied upon an artery on the distal side of an aneurism, if any branch inter- vened between the ligature and the sac; and thus assuming that the mode by which a ligature placed on an aneurismal artery cured the disease, could only be by causing a stagnation and subsequent coagulation of blood within the sac, they naturally inferred that a stream of blood, however small, through the tumour, would prevent such coagulation taking place. Alluding to the case operated upon by Deschamps, and the cause of its fail- ure, Hodgson observes:— “ If a stream continued to pass through the aneurism into branches which originated below it, the blood contained in the tumour was not at rest, and consequently did not coagu- late ; a cure could not, therefore, be expected to ensue on the principle which led to the performance of the operation.” And again, “ It must be acknowledged, however, that it will be almost impossible in any case to ascer- tain that no branch arises from the sac, which by continuing the circulation through the latter, may defeat the objects of the opera- tion.” From the important pathological fact, that in the processes which are employed by Nature for effecting the “ spontaneous cure” of an aneurism, and likewise from the cir- cumstance, that in some cases of popliteal aneurism, where the Hunterian operation had been performed, a complete stoppage of the circulation of the blood within the tumour had not been required, it appeared to me a legitimate conclusion,—that the progress of an aneurism might be arrested, or even the tu- mour consolidated, by placing a ligature on one of the branches of a diseased trunk. It being admitted that a diminution in the force of the circulation of the blood, through an aneurismal sac, was sufficient to cure the disease, the important question still remained to be determined,—to what degree is it re- quired to diminish the momentum of the cir- culation through an aneurism in order to per- mit a fibrinous concretion to be formed within the sac ? Here it is of importance to observe the difference between a coagulum of red blood and the concrete fibrine formed within an aneurismal sac, as the formation of each must be the result of a very different process. The word coagulum, as I have already noticed when speaking of the anatomical characters of aneurism, has been commonly employed to express both coagulated red blood and con- creted fibrine, and, therefore, when we speak of the artificial means of effecting a coagula- tion of the contents of an aneurism, we ought to discriminate whether such means are re- quired to promote the formation of a fibrinous concretion, or merely to produce a coagulation of the red blood within the sac. According to the principles of operating, both of Hunter and Brasdor, their operations were adopted with the conviction—that by putting a complete stop to the circulation in the tumour, there would be not only a stagnation but a coagulation of the red blood within the sac. It is quite evident, however, that in those cases of popliteal aneurism, where a curative process was esta- blished by tying the superficial femoral artery, and in which a stream of blood still continued to pass through the sac, no coagulum of red blood would be formed, but the parietes of the sac would be thickened, or its cavity ulti- mately obliterated, by the deposition of fibrine. It is equally clear, that in all those aneurisms in which a “ spontaneous cure” has been effect- ed, or where an effort has been made by the economy to prevent the rupture of an aneur- ismal sac by the addition of new matter to its parietes, that new matter is not coagulated red blood, but invariably consists of a suc- cession of laminae of organized concreted fibrine. That a very moderate degree of diminution in the impetus of the circulation in an aneur- ismal sac is sufficient to allow fibrine to be effused within its parietes, seemed to me proved from the pathological facts which have been pointed out, when speaking of the spontaneous cure of the disease, and more especially from having observed, in an aneurism of the inno- minata, that Nature had arrested the progress of the tumour, by obliterating the carotid ar- tery. In examining, likewise, the cases where a “ spontaneous cure” had taken place by a bar- rier to the circulation of the blood in the sac being formed by an obstruction in the vessel on the capillary side of the aneurism, it was evident that a process of coagulation in the aneurismal sac must have commenced at a time when the momentum of the blood within the sac could have only been diminished in a very slight degree, no greater change having taken place in the force of the circulation than might be supposed to be the effect of an enlargement of the arterial tube at the diseased part. Neither could it be supposed that the arteries which were obliterated in the cases alluded to, had undergone any thing like a sudden obstruction ; on the contrary, what- ever was the process, the arterial canals appeared to have been gradually obstructed ; this being indicated by the slow diminution in the force of their pulsation during life. But besides the phenomena already stated, no circumstance appeared more conclusive in pointing out this diminution of the blood’s momentum to have been very slight, than laminated fibrinous concretions being often found within aneurismal sacs of so small a size, that the change in the velocity of the circula- tion within them must have been very incon- siderable.

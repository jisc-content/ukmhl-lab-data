624 CANCER, PATHOLOGY OF. sented the slightest symptom of such disease' (Bavle) : Fourthly, surgeons have frequently wounded themselves in the extirpation and dissection of cancerous growths, without suf- fering in consequence from carcinomatous dis- ease. (Jager.) (b.) Predisposing causes.— 1 o this class be- long all conditions which are supposed to modify the organic state of individuals in such manner as to prepare them, as it were, for the influence of the direct causes of disease. 1. Age.—The different species of carcinoma may originate at every period of existence. In a remarkable case described by Billard2 development of scirrhus had taken place in the heart during intra-uterine life ; under the head of Meningeal Encephaloid we shall have occasion to refer to two cases in which that affection existed at birth ; and Mr. Travers3 has figured a remarkable specimen of conge- nital encephaloid of the eye observed by him- self and Sir A. Cooper when the infant was eight months old ; at birth the eyeball was as large as a walnut. M. Cruveilhier has, on the other hand, known uterine cancer mani- fest itself at the advanced age of eighty-four. The general sense of authors on this point, however, is that the disease rarely occurs in early life, seldom originates in old age, and is especially frequent in both sexes between the ages of thirty-five and fifty. As the accuracy of this notion had never been tested statisti- cally, we felt desirous of supplying the very obvious desideratum in our knowledge of the general laws of the disease ; and accordingly obtained permission to examine the returns of deaths supplied to the Registrar-General in pursuance of the late Registration Act4. In applying to this source there were some particular advantages not usually enjoyed by those who have endeavoured to determine the influence of age on diseases by statistical evi- dence : their cases have, with few' exceptions, been collected in hospitals, consequently among individuals of a particular age, of a cer- tain station in society, and usually exposed to peculiar influences destructive of health. The Registration includes persons of every rank and of every age ; in using the documents it furnishes, we were consequently protected from numerous sources of error. Fortunately, too, for our present purpose, cancerous dis- ease, before it proves fatal, exhibits its charac- ters in so marked a manner, as to leave little apprehension of mistakes in diagnosis having occurred. 1 In a single instance only, an eruption of small pimples occurred at the extremity of the penis imme- diately after coition, but it disappeared spontaneously in a few days, and differed in nowise from the eruption occasionally produced by acrid leucorrhteal discharge. i Traite "dcs Maladies des Enfans, PI. viii.

PI. v. fig. 2. 4 For the Registrar-General’s permission, we are indebted to the obliging interference of Mr. Farr, and seize the opportunity of expressing our gratitude to that gentleman not only for this kindness, but for several suggestions regarding this branch of our subject. To the period of death, and not of develop- ment of the disease, the following tables of course immediately refer ; but as the ages are arranged in decennial periods in our propor- tional tables, and the mean duration of cancer of all kinds,in allorgans,and in subjects of every age, does not in all probability much exceed two years and a half, the error would be slight were the results applied to the period of de- velopment. Twelve hundred cases seemed sufficient for obtaining the rate and law of mortality ; to this number W'e accordingly limited our extracts. Their mode of distri- bution is seen in the following table :— TABLE I. Showing the absolute mortality from Carcinoma in both sexes and at all ages. AGE. MALES.

It appears for example that 250 females die of cancer between the ages of 50 and 60, while 118 perish between those of 70 and 80 ; but if the total number of females living of the former age were double that of those alive of the latter, the proportional mortality at both de- cennial periods of life would be as nearly as possible equal, instead of being in one of them double that of the other. In a word, in order to ascertain whether particular ages exercise any influence on the development of the dis- ease, we must compare the absolute mortality

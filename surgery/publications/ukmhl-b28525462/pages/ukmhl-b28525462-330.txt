ANKYLOSIS. 32 0 tissues has been denied altogether : be the period however what it may, it is probable that any structural change, which may take place in parts rendered unserviceable by acci- dent or disease will be rapid, in proportion to the shortness of the interval during which the deposition and subsequent removal and re- newal of parts takes place. If this position be correct, we should suppose that in infancy and youth, setting aside the extensibility of all the tissues in early life, which is of material as- sistance to us in the treatment of partial anky- losis, a shorter time would suffice to engender structural and inextensible shortening of a muscle in youth than in adult life, as confess- edly the processes of decomposition, renewal, and growth, take place in much more rapid succession in early life than at later periods. This supposition, as far as my experience has hitherto reached, is confirmed by observation. If the muscles of a limb have been contracted four or five years from the constant repose of the latter in a given position in two individuals, the one a child or youth, the other an adult, it wall be found that, apart from whatever in- terstitial and extraneous deposit of lymph may have taken place about the articulation, the contracted muscles of the child wall be less readily stretched out than those of the adult. It may here be observed, that, diagnosticating in all such cases of ankylosis from rigidity of muscles, we must be certain that, no deception be practised by the patient, and ascertain posi- tively, if possible, whether the limb has really been as much bent as long as may have been asserted ; and whether on no occasion what- ever, it has been straightened. The rationale of the occurrence of this structural shortening, is in my opinion as follow's. There exists a certain relation between the growth and development of various parts, and their being constantly and properly exercised in the performance of their allotted function, their being kept in a state of activity ; this does not apply merely to the increased thick- ness of muscles, which follow's so notoriously upon augmented action, nor is it a consequence of the nervous energy being supplied tb the parts from the nervous centres in a greater or less degree, as it takes place in other parts besides muscle, and where the supply of nervous energy undergoes no alteration ; it seems to depend upon a providential law' of the animal economy by w'hich parts are increased or diminished according to the necessity for them. Thus when a healthy foot through spasmodic contrac- tion of certain muscles is converted into talipes varus (a most common form of the vulgarly named club-foot,) and has its dorsal instead of its plantar surface turned towards the ground, so that the upper surface of some of the bones of the tarsus touch the earth ; a common consequence of so unnatural a mode of progression is that the parts, irritated by contact with the ground, become protected by the formation of a huge bump of dense semi- elastic tissue. This bump, when examined, is 11 seen to consist first of thickened cuticle and i cutis, beneath which is a soft globular cushion of adipose tissue ; to this succeeds a fibrous i growth, denser than usual, consisting of the hypertrophied fascia and ligaments ; im- mediately upon the bones this appears to be- come semi-cartilaginous, and lastly from depo- sition of osseous particles in the latter, the bone appears to be covered with bony in crus- i tations. So that we have formed for the pro- tection of the dorsum of the foot from being wounded by attrition, a mass gradually increas- ; ing in density, as it is examined from without inw'ards. Again, when a foot thus distorted from birth, is restored to its natural form and the patientâ€™s heel is made to touch the ground, the dense ligamentous and adipose cushion, which covers the under part of the heel of a healthy foot, becomes here much increased in size. We have innumerable instances of this, in the progress of surgical diseases. On the contrary w'hen muscles, from whatever cause, are thrown into a state of constant contraction either passive (from rest of the limb in a cer- tain position), or active (from spasm), not only do they become worsted in bulk, as is commonly stated from w'ant of use, but the muscular fibres become permanently short- ened, inelastic, not merely because having been long contracted the individual parts have become adherent to one another, but a period sufficiently long for the complete re- newal of their integrant parts having elapsed, the individual fibres are rendered positively shorter, in consequence of the altered re- lation of parts ; and we might as well think of stretching a living biceps beyond its ex- treme natural length by means of weights at- tached to it, as to attempt to elongate muscles - integrally shortened after long continued con- traction, with the aid of manipulations and the best contrived mechanical instruments, unless continued for a time so long that perseverance would be almost impossible. Indeed I have often found that the long continued attempts in such cases to stretch the muscles, have had the same effect, as exercise upon healthy mus- cles, namely to increase their bulk and conse- quently their resistance. The reader must bear in mind, that I allude to muscles contracted longer than the time during which physiologists believe the integrant parts are renewed ; and pa- thological experience, I have stated, tells us that this period is long in adults, as long standing partial ankyloses, which have taken place after the attainment of manhood, may be cured solely by mechanical means after many years duration. But in children it is often other- wise ; partly on account of the cause 1 have just discussed, and from another equally striking cause, although neither have, as 1 am aware of, been noticed by practitioners. During the time that muscles on the one side of a limb are contracted from any cause, and are under- going interstitial shortening in the manner I have described, the bones advancing gradual- ly towards their full development, shoot out and become lengthened ; and thus the dispro-

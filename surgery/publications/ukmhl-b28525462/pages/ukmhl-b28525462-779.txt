CEPHALHEMATOMA. 763 with sub-pericranial cephalhsematoma; such was the fact in the above case, and in five in- stances observed by Dr. Burchard, and M. Baron has almost always noted the coexistence of an external tumour. Professor Moreau, however, as is stated by M. Dubois, has met with an example of uncomplicated super- meningeal effusion, whence it follows that this cannot be regarded as a mere effect or advanced stage of sub-pericranial cephalhae- matoma. The size and form of the opening in the bone, where such exists, are variable. In some instances it is a mere fissure of very limited extent; in others, as we have seen, it almost completely surrounds the external ac- cumulation. In some cases the bone is per- forated by a multitude of small openings like a sieve, or a single foramen of considerable size may be observed. In some cases the blood flows freely from one surface to the other through the perforation ; such may pro- bably, as already remarked, have been the fact in instances of external blood swelling, attended with pulsation. The corresponding part of the dura mater appears, according to the statement of Burchard, to be very closely connected with the bone at the periphery of the tumour, and through the medium of the same kind of adventitious ossiform matter, described as forming the prominent margin of the sub-pericranial swelling : the separation could not be effected without the help of a knife. Whether the perforation of the cranium is the result of imperfect development, disease, or traumatic lesion of the bone, or of the de- structive action of an external effusion, cannot, from existing experience, be determined : re- lated cases, however, show, according to their authors, that the two latter agencies have pro- duced it. Of the causes of this species of effusion nothing is known ; unless in cases when it appears to be an effect of the sub-pericranial variety. The prognosis is, under all circumstances, most unfavourable; communication with a sub-pericranial cephalhaematoma, for reasons to be presently stated, in all probability les- sens the gravity of the case. Of the fact of absorption of the effused blood ever occurring there is no proof at present ; M. Velpeau suggests that it may become the origin of a “ fungous tumour of the dura mater.” As there are no marks now known whereby the cerebral symptoms induced by this affection may be distinguished satisfactorily, it seems almost unnecessary to speak of its treatment ; nevertheless, when such symptoms arise in an infant labouring under sub-pericranial ce- phalhaematoma, they may be plausibly ascribed to complication with the intra-cranial variety. Now, in this case the practitioner should hasten to incise the external swelling, as, if it communicate at all freely with the internal, the contents of the latter may be evacuated, and the brain relieved of pressure (Valleix). The degree of fluidity of the contained fluid will affect the result of this proceeding, the utility of which has not been practically tested. $ 3. Interstitial Cephalhematoma? A case in which the effused blood is alleged to have been contained between the two plates of the parietal bone, separating these in the manner of the walls of the frontal sinuses, is noticed by Burchard. But the description given of the parts connected with the tumour is unsatisfactory, and it is at least possible that the supposed external table may have been an ossified portion of pericranium. Further experience must be had upon this as upon almost all points in the anatomical his- tory of the affection'. Bibliography.—B. Gooch, A practical Treatise on Wounds, vol. i. p. 822.

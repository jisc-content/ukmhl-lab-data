Painful, difficult, and scanty micturition may arise from such a va- riety of causes connected with the condition of the various parts of the urinary organs, that it can only be regarded as a symptom, which, taken by itself, is by no means sufficient to determine the nature of that condition or lesion. It was a common error with the elder surgeons to mistake a prominent symptom for a peculiar and distinct affection, and in this way very serious errors, both in teaching and prac- tice, have been propagated. For the advance- ment of both, no doubt much benefit is being derived from that critical severity which, un- der the guidance of a more accurate patho- logy, is gradually restricting the employment of such vague terms.

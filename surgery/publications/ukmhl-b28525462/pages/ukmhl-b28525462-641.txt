CANCER, PATHOLOGY OF. 627 population of 1,762,710, exposed per eminen- tiam to what are esteemed the insalubrious conditions of the life of town artisans, is 152; while in a number of rural districts, contain- ing’ 1,776,980 souls, 163 individuals fell victims to the disease. Finally, comparing the deaths from cancer in the metropolis and provincial towns on the one hand, with those in all the rural districts referred to on the other (337 in the former, and 289 in the latter), we obtain an annual mortality of '189 per thousand in large towns, and of-165 in the country. The character of this result is rendered more dis- tinct by comparing it with the rate of mor- tality, from all diseases indiscriminately, in the same towns and counties: the annual mortality in the former is 27 per thousand ; in the latter 16-9 per thousand, showing a remarkable mi- nority in favour of a country life. Hence it appears that a town life is far from exercising any serious influence on the pro- duction and mortality of cancer. And if the fact be taken into consideration, that many cancerous subjects, who have acquired the disease in the country, remove, as an ultima spes, to the large town in their vicinity for the sake of the professional aid it affords, die and are registered there, and consequently swell the sum of deaths from the disease in cities, while they,pro tanto, diminish it in coun- ties, the innocuousness in this respect of a city habitation, will appear in still stronger relief'. A curious fact connected with the question of metropolitan and provincial frequency of cancer is, that females furnish the excess in towns, whenever such excess occurs; this is seen in the following table:— Metropolis and Towns. Counties and Rural Districts. <u 45 42 29 53 . ^ 74 95 w 140 82 'rt s 123 110 o 263 192 A number of d priori ways of explaining this peculiarity might easily be advanced, but the reader will probably agree with us in the propriety of suppressing any such hypotheses. One thing is certain, that the law in respect of cancerous diseases differs from that regu- lating the sexual ratio of general mortality in towns and country. The following numbers, representing the total deaths in the cities and counties referred to, show that the mortality of the former exceeds that of the latter by very nearly the same amount in each sex. Cities. Counties. Males .... 24,402 14,841 Females. . . 23,551 14.852 ' The general result above given is, we are enabled to state, confirmed by the registration of 1838 The share of the total mortality caused by cancer, in the cities and the country compa- ratively, is exhibited in the following table :— Population in October, 1837. Total specified Deaths. Deaths from Cancer. Propor. in 1000 Deaths. Towns . . 3,553,161 46,849 337 7-193 Counties 3,500,750 28,036 289 10-308 This result is exactly of the kind we might have expected : as the number of deaths from diseases, propagated or increased in seve- rity by the insalubriousness of large towns, is necessarily less in rural districts than ir cities, the proportion of deaths, from affec- tions not thus influenced, must be higher in the former than in the latter. 5. Habitation of a densely-peopled locality.— The influence of concentration of population is evidently null ; in the metropolis there are 25,758 individuals to a square mile; in the counties, with which it has been compared, only 222,—a ratio completely out of propor- tion with that of cancerous disease in the two localities. In order to elucidate this point further, we extracted from the registers 470 deaths from cancer occurring in the metropolis, from July 1, 1837, to December 31, 1838, and arranged according to the Unions in which they took place. By collecting the Unions into three groups, ascertained by Mr. Farr to present different degrees of general salubrity, it will at once appear whether cancer follows the same law, in this respect, as others of the most destructive maladies. The absolute number of cases is given in the following table :— Thirty-one Unions. Deaths from Cancer.' M. F. Total. A. 10 most unhealthy . . . 14 82 96 B. J1 of medium salubritv . 36 103 139 C. 10 healthiest 46 189 235 But as the estimated population of these three districts, in March, 1838 (the middle point of the eighteen months during which the cases occurred), were respectively 517,288, A ; 505,746, B ; 787,785, C ; it follows that the annual deaths from cancer were, in district A, •123 ; in B, U83 ; and in C, ’199 per thousand living. Hence the mortality increases with the salubrity of the locality ; a result which is rendered more startling by comparing it with the calculations of Mr. Farr, of the annual mortality from all diseases, from typhoid fever and from phthisis in the same districts'. 1 Loc. cit. p. 113.

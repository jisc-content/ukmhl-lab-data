92 EMPHYSEMA. the chest, in which the application of a band- age caused immediate death. It may be gathered, from what we have said on the physiology of emphysema, that any means calculated to confine the motions of the affected side, without interfering with those of the uninjured one, would be emi- nently useful. It seems to us, that this pur- pose might be effected with the starch appa- ratus,—care being taken, before its applica- tion to the injured half of the thorax, to remove the subcutaneous air as effectually as possible. The seat of the wound should be the last part invested, and the adjustment of the whole managed with as much celerity as possible. When the emphysema has ceased to in- crease, the absorption of the effused air may be promoted by the external remedies already alluded to. The painful feeling of distension, occasionally experienced in the most tumid parts, may be relieved by friction with un- guentum cetacei, or any similar substance. In cases of emphysema resulting from rup- ture of the vesicles during violent fits of coughing, &c., the immediate danger from suffocation, if such exist, may be averted by free scarification. M. Vitry’s case proves the excellence of the practice. Venesection, un- less otherwise counter-indicated, must be at once had recourse to ; the antiphlogistic regi- men enforced ; and the primary affection com- bated by demulcents, opiates, and antispasmo- dics. Digitalis may be usefully combined with these. The treatment of spontaneous emphysema hardly belongs to the province of the surgeon. As the only species of which the nature is understood, and of which, therefore, it is pos- sible to prescribe the treatment beforehand, depends on a decomposed state of the fluids and solids, it is manifest that the practitioner’s chief object must be to correct that state by constitutional means. The use of aromatic and stimulating liniments, to promote the ac- tion of the capillaries, is recommended. To this there can be no possible objection. But it is exceedingly doubtful whether scarifica- tion should ever be had recourse to, unless in cases of imminent asphyxia. The prognosis in diseases where emphysema of this kind occurs is so exceedingly unfavourable, that the mere relief of the symptom in question can scarcely be supposed capable of influencing the event. Wounds inflicted upon tissues, of which the vital properties are altered in the manner supposed, are exceedingly prone to become gangrenous. Bibliography.—Mery et Littre, Memoires de l'Acad. des Sc.

FRACTURE. 243 to give some idea of the comparative fre- quency of fractures of different bones. The following table1 is quoted as a satisfactory approximation to the truth. FRACTURES OF THE NUMBER.

Total. . . 959 758 64 1 137 31 Now, according to the above, the following is the order in point of frequency in which the more common fractures occur, namely, Fractures of the Leg, Upper extremity, Thigh, Clavicle, Ribs, Skull, Jaws, Patella, Foot, Scapula, Fingers, Spine. It may be worth while to remember that certain circumstances will somewhat modify the inferences to be deduced from the above. We may suppose that slight or mild cases of fracture (as of the fibula) would rather increase the number set down to the leg, the clavicle, and especially the fore-arm, the fingers and foot. Again, perhaps, the proportion of skull- 1 Statistics of Fractures and Dislocations treated in the Pennsylvania Hospital during the Ten Years from 1830 to 1839 inclusive. By George W. Norris, M.D., one of the Surgeons to the Institution. See the American Journal of the Medical Sciences, April 1841. fractures ought to be a little increased to include immediately fatal injuries which are not brought to a hospital, and the same is to be observed for all the bones of the trunk. Not a few cases of fractured ribs are treated in private. It may be supposed that the fractures of the thigh are all enumerated, and that, like all the severer cases brought in for treatment, they refer to the widest range of population. The number is possibly a little too high for fractured scapulae, the diagnosis of which is somewhat uncertain, and examples of which are very scanty in museumsh The fractures of the carpus are not stated apart from those of the fore-arm with which they are so often combined, and, doubtless, some cases of broken leg include injury to the tarsal bones, as we commonly find. Two hundred and twenty urgent cases of fracture were admitted at Guyâ€™s hospital in one year ; and the following are the varieties, and their respective numbers : FRACTURES OF THE Nos.

Independently of the varieties of fracture 1 For instance, writers describe, and surgeons dia- gnosticate, fracture of the neck of the scapula; and some seem to suppose that this injury may occur fre- quently ; but I have never been able to find an example in proof, nor have I ever heard or read of a dissected specimen of the accident. There seem to be many reasons why it should take place with difficulty, even if it happen at all, as a simple fracture.

Bourgery has obligingly favoured the writer of this article with a further account of the segmental enterotome ; but unfortunately the communication of this highly talented surgeon arrived too late to be embodied in the text. M. Bourgery states that the instrument represented in figs. 256, 257, 258, 259, is his own modification of the enterotome of M. Liotard. The instrument of the latter was successfully used on animals, and once employed with advantage on the human subject by M. Blandin ; but in consequence of this surgeon experiencing much difficulty in the introduction of a large circle into the fistula, M. Bourgery devised the present modification, whereby the breadth of the compressing part of the instrument can be diminished.

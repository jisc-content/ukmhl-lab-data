34 ABSCESS. tain for the surgeon the same evidence of fluc- tuation. In such cases, however, there is one indication which we should not fail to look for, viz., the doughy state of the soft parts external to the purulent collection. This pasty con- dition of the subcutaneous cellular tissue, in the absence of well marked fluctuation, is a valuable addition to the other remote, sympa- thetic, and functional signs of abscess, tending, if the rational signs be also present, to dispel all doubt in diagnosticating deep seated abscess of the limbs, of which it is by some surgeons deemed an almost unerring indication. It will guide us also in discovering, in conjunc- tion with those signs, pus formed, either in the articulations, or in the organs occupying the ca- vities of the body. The detection of purulent collections in obscure cases nevertheless fre- quently requires the exercise of great judg- ment, habit, and tact. When an abscess has been developed slowly in deep-seated parts, and its investing cyst has acquired considerable thickness, the diagnostic is difficult; the collection may be mistaken for a tumour of encysted, steatomatous, or other nature, and it will only be by taking into ac- count the previous degree of irritation, by seeking to appreciate the fluctuation however obscure, the greater or less defined circum- scription of the tumour, and by carefully ob- serving its progressive increase, that the con- duct of the practitioner will be most safely guided. The recognition of pus formed between the interstices of muscle, covered by thick and in- extensible aponeurosis, is also a matter of much difficulty ; and though local and constitutional symptoms will often run high, the practitioner will still remain much embarrassed, and the more so, as the limiting the ravages which the pus may occasion depends entirely on his promptitude in giving issue to it. If an ab- scess of this kind be not timely detected, and the matter evacuated artificially, it may oc- casion irreparable mischief. We must not wait till the fluctuation is unequivocally evi- dent, for if we wait for such an event, or leave the matter to its unchecked course, it will have time to fuse along the tendinous expan- sions, burrow in the interstices of the muscles, detaching them from each other and from the bones, denude the latter of their periosteum, which it softens or inflames, or arrive at some neighbouring articulation or natural cavity which it may invade. In order to diminish the obscurity which attaches to the formation of abscess under aponeurotic or fascial expan- sions, it is of the highest importance to the practical surgeon to study carefully the situa- tions, direction, degree of resistance, and the natural apertures of those aponeuroses under which abscesses are observed to take place. Accurate data on these points will give him great confidence in discriminating and pre- dicting the issues in such cases ; and for this purpose we cannot do better than refer him to the excellent work of Blandin on this sub- ject. The difficulty sometimes depends on the mode in which the pus is contained in the parts in which it is formed ; as when the con- taining cyst is very tense from the quantity of the pus, and is at the same time deep-seated; on the other hand, pus is sometimes diffused in the loose cellular tissue, infiltrating its areoles, and not collected into one cavity, or bounded by a distinct membrane ; when fluc- tuation is sought for, it is not detected, the pus is merely displaced and driven into other points, and the surface does not spring up again, but remains pitted as in common oedema; this circumstance sometimes adds to the ob- scurity of sub-aponeurotic abscess also ; instan- ces of this kind will be observed under the pectoral muscles. Superficial abscess occurring secondarily, or subsequently to inflammation of an internal organ may be sometimes overlooked, in conse- quence of the attention remaining exclusively fixed on the primitive seat of the inflammation; thus abscess in the perineum, or in the spongy body of the urethra sympathetic with ureth- ritis may be overlooked : the same observa- tion will also hold with regard to cystitis, ab- scess being here known to occur in the cellular tissue behind the muscles, above the pubis, &c. In such cases the inflammation is propa- gated from the neighbouring organ to the sur- rounding or vicinal cellular tissue, suppura- tion terminates the inflammation in the latter case, while resolution succeeds the former, though the cellular tissue was only involved in the inflammation, secondarily, and as it were by continuity ; thus the walls of the abdomen present abscesses after peritonitis, the medias- tinum and walls of the chest after pleuritis, the cellular tissue in the cheek or gums after tooth- ache, &c. Abscesses developed externally to serous membranes after effusion has taken f place into their cavities, though constituting ' a distinct disease, are produced by the influ- ence of this same sympathy or continuity. Abscesses formed in the mucous membranes of the outlets of the body, are in point of fa- cility of recognition on the same level as those formed superficially, such as in the mouth, the lower end of the rectum, vagina, &c. In phlegmonous abscess, the symptoms may be recognized, and the matter detected almost as soon as formed. We have the reverse of this in the symptomatic abscess; here all is obscure, slow, and uncertain, till the external fluctuating tumour becomes apparent. The tumour itself is not painful nor inflamed, nor is there any expectation of its appearance ex- cited, by any previous sensation acknowledged by the patient; for the pain, heaviness, incon- venience, stiffness, or fulness which may be felt in the parts in which the pus is being formed, are insufficient to awaken suspicion. These however, with difficulty of respiration, dull sound in the lower part of the chest, puf- fed or swollen abdomen, marked alteration of one or more of the vertebrae, irregular fever, night sweats, and the effects of pressure on the double organs contained in the pelvis, will con- tribute to show the nature of the case ; the collection itself will be rendered more mani-

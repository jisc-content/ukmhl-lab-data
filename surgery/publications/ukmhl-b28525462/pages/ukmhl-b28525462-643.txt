629 CANCER, PATHOLOGY OF. disease. But other causes may contribute to produce this result—and the exact significa- tion of the word “ ulcers ” is of course doubt- ful. In the hope of throwing some light on the influence, if any, of particular kinds of occu- pation, we noted the trade or profession of 650 individuals as stated in the registers. The result is now laid before the reader. We have grouped together all working artisans into a single class; and individuals gaining their livelihood by labour into another; wives and daughters are ranked according to the occupation of the husband or father. This method of arrangement is justified in re- spect, at least, of the social position of the subjects. MALES.

Now no materials exist for the establish- ment of this preliminary point; and there are other conditions—of which it is next to impossible to express the influence numeri- cally—which render the establishment of the influence of profession on disease in general, one of the most difficult and least certain points of medical statistics. We may, how- ever, we think, justly conclude from this table that the operative classes of the community furnish a fair proportion, at least, of the gene- ral mortality from the disease. The quantity of death produced by cancer in proportion to the total mortality is greater among the higher than the lower orders : this we have ascer- tained by comparing in the following table the proportion of cancerous death among in- dividuals assured by the Equitable Society, who all belong to the better ranks, with that furnished by the total specified mortality of England and Wales among people of every station. ’ By these terms are meant, it is to be presumed, independent persons, or those who follow no particu- cular trade or profession.

The wealthier portion of the population—that as- sured in the Equitable—suffers infinitely less from the epidemic and contagious diseases generated by “ entassement” and the evils of atmospheric impurity than the poor ; the for- mer therefore are more open to the slow de- struction of cancer. Besides, the selection exercised by the Assurance Companies, ex- cluding deaths under twenty years, and conse- quently a vast mass of the population scarcely liable to suffer from cancer, reduces the mor- tality from the febrile exanthemata to a mere nothing, and lowers that from phthisis by more than half2: all these circumstances tend 5 See Fan’s Vital Statistics, p. 588.

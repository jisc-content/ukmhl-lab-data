EMPYEMA. 117 article is in an extremely unfinished state, and might probably have undergone some modifi- cation, had its lamented author lived to pre- pare it for the press, we consider any commu- nication proceeding from such a source of suf- ficient importance to deserve very careful con- sideration. We shall, therefore, give a brief statement of the more striking particulars of Dr. Hope’s sketch. Dr. Hope conceives that the great mor- tality which he ascribes to chronic pleurisy, in some measure depends upon the error of systematic writers, “ who mistake the state of anaemia, with its quick pulse, for irritative fever, by which they not only mislead them- selves, but also their readers, as to the nature of the patient’s condition, and consequently as to the appropriate means of cure.” Hence has arisen, according to Dr. Hope, a far too unfavourable impression of the curability of chronic pleurisy with effusion. He had him- self been “ instrumental in curing five-and- thirty cases consecutively, during the space i of four years ; but principally two years and a half, while assistant-physician to St. George’s Hospital.” The treatment under which these favourable results occurred was as follows :— ! Dr. Hope always used mercury “ in all de- grees of intensity, with opium in full propor- ! tion,”—the milder and external forms when the others could not be borne, and to such j extent as to produce prompt and free saliva- | tion. Blisters, with diuretics—squill, nitric | aether, juniper, iodide of potassium, and, when i there was no irritation of the mucous mem- branes, the various other preparations of ! potass, were conjoined with the mercurial | treatment. A powerful hydragogue was had ( recourse to, if the remedies now enumerated i had failed, for two or three days : half a grain to a grain of elaterium, combined with calomel I and capsicum to prevent nausea ; or the pulv. jalap, comp., so as to produce ten or 1 twelve copious watery evacuations per diem, : stimulants being at hand in case of any sink- ing tendency. Inconvenience sometimes resulted from hypersalivation, which greatly retarded the convalescence. The action of the remedy was, however, easily controlled, by omitting ! it for two or three days, or by merely dimi- i nishing the dose : it did not do to suspend its | use altogether. Much stress is laid by the author upon the statement, that great accele- j ration of pulse, with thirst, craving for cold drinks, and dry heat of skin, is not necessa- I rily a result of fever, but is necessarily a i result of anaemia, occasioned by the defi- | ciency of oxygenation from the total in- I capacity of one lung at least. To patients ,! thus conditioned, Dr. Hope allows at least 1 one or two pints of concentrated beef-tea ; and, if the state of the tongue and alimentary I canal fully authorize it, permits them tender [ old mutton or beef for dinner. Even when hectic fever is established, Dr. Hope found the use of mercury still iudispensable ; when it had been omitted con- trary to his wishes, a recurrence of the effu- sion has taken place, and on the resumption of mercury with opium the fluid has again disappeared. When the hectic fever is nearly removed, preparations of iron and mineral acids are given to co-operate with nourishing food in removing all remains of anaemia. These latter medicines are to be well guarded with laudanum. The theory of tonic treatment here broach- ed by Dr. Hope, is, we believe, new, and, so far as the author’s paper goes, unestablished ; the practice our previous details have shown to be anything but novel. In recommending the exhibition of mercury in a hectic state of the system, Dr. Hope, as he was himself well aware, is in opposition with almost every writer on the subject of empyema ; nor can we discover in his posthumous fragment any evidence satisfactorily proving the fallacy of the general opinion.

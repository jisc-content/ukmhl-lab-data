191 ANASTOMOSIS. rial capillaries in every organ, and in every part of the body. Besides the important offices which anasto- mosis performs in securing to every part of the system a necessary supply of arterial blood as well as of modifying the velocity of the cur- rent of blood in different organs, the inos- culations of arteries execute a no less import- ant function, when, either from disease or accident, the flow of blood through an arterial trunk has become interrupted. To such extent, indeed, is this office of the anastomosing vessels sometimes demanded, that not only have large arteries been obstruc- ted while the blood continued to be supplied in sufficient quantity to the parts on which they were ramified, but trunks of the first order in magnitude, and even the aorta itself, have been obliterated, and the circulation has been carried on by the anastomosing vessels. The mode by which this important office of the anastomosing vessels is performed is a subject of interesting investigation. When the obstruction of an artery is caused by disease, as a diminution of the calibre of the vessel must almost in every case take place very slowly, the enlargement of the in- osculating vessels must also progressively cor- respond ; but where a ligature is placed on an artery, or the flow of blood through it, is by any cause suddenly interrupted, the changes in the inosculating branches, or in those ves- sels which are to supply the part with the blood to which the obstructed artery was distributed, must be immediate. These changes have been observed by examining limbs in which the principal arterial trunk had been obstructed, and the parts examined at different periods after a ligature had been placed on an | arterial trunk, more particularly in cases wher- ever such an operation had been performed for the cure of aneurism. Some changes in the inosculating vessels may also be observed during life, when the inosculating branches are superficial, as the branch of the external carotid ; or, still more distinctly, when they are also situated in a transparent part such as the conjunctiva or the cornea. No sooner is the circulation through an artery obstructed, than an immediate change takes place in the anastomosing vessels. I had an opportunity of observing these changes in the branches of the external carotid artery, after a ligature was placed on the trunk of the common carotid artery of the opposite side, in the instance of a very young and emaciated subject, so that the vessels could be distinctly seen through the thin and delicate skin which covered them. No sooner was the flow of blood through the common trunk of the carotid artery impeded, than the branches of the external carotid of the opposite side of the head, more particularly the temporal and occipital vessels, became manifestly enlarged and tortuous, exactly in the same manner as when an injection is forcibly thrown into the arteries of the dead body, whilst, at the same time their action became very much in- creased. It is by no means unfrequent, when a part of the cornea has become dim, or a speck has been formed in consequence of previous in- flammation, that one or more vessels convey- ing red blood pass across the transparent part of the cornea and terminate in the speck. However dubious the benefit from such a practice may generally be, yet the vessels in such cases have frequently been divided, in order to prevent the speck being nourished, and thus to aid the action of local stimulants in promoting the absorption of the opaque matter. When only one red vessel can be discriminated passing into a speck, and if it be not only divided, but a portion of it also re- moved, and the eye examined, even a few hours afterwards, besides more or less redness, both of the corneal and sclerotic conjunctiva, occasioned by the excitement of the opera- tion, the divided vessel appears regenerated, and a trunk is observed of the same size, and precisely in the same situation, uniting with, or in continuation of that portion of the canal which had been not only divided, but alto- gether removed. The changes which have been met with in the dissection of limbs, the arterial trunks of which had been obliterated for the cure of aneurism, satisfactorily explain not only the ultimate changes of the inosculating vessels which are employed to carry on the circula- tion, but enable us satisfactorily to account for the immediate effects which take place on the inosculating branches, when the circula- tion through an arterial trunk is suddenly ob- structed ; they also explain the cause of that singular appearance, the almost immediate re- generation of an artery, observed when a portion of a vessel passing into a speck of the cornea has been removed. From the dissections of limbs which have been operated upon for aneurism, at a very long period after the operation had been per- formed, a trunk almost as large as the femoral artery itself has been found so near the site of the original trunk that it must have been mistaken for it, had not the thickened and collapsed cord into which the obstructed ves- sel was converted been discovered. In a patient, whose limb was amputated many years after the femoral artery had been obliterated, for the cure of a popliteal aneurism, there was a trunk observed on the surface of the stump, similar in size, and apparently situated so pre- cisely in the place of the femoral artery, that the operator was puzzled to account for the appearance, but the circumstance was readily explained by finding, on the examination of the amputated limb, the remains of the original ves- sel converted into a substance resembling the umbilical cord, whilst the limb was chiefly sup- plied with blood by a large trunk which ran parallel, and in close contact with the oblitera- ted vessel, (A. Cooper). This interesting fact will, therefore, account for the hitherto inexpli- cable cfrcumstance which has been mentioned, of the almost immediate appearance of a red vessel on the cornea even after a portion of one has been removed: the new vessel.

If any operation be admissible it is evidently the complete ablation, and this only, of the diseased growth. And if we look to past ex- perience for facts justifying such extirpation, we shall find few to encourage us in pursuing or recommending the practice, or to authorize the surgeon in regarding the affection other- wise than with Ebermaier, as a noli me tangere. The successful issue in the cases of Severinus and Wepfer must be looked on as a fortunate chance; of the only two operations, as we believe, performed of late years—those by Berard and Orioli—the latter, it is true, ter- minated successfully, the other fatally in 34 hours. The operation, however, can neither claim the honour of the /ecovcry in the one case, for this was the accidental effect of gan- grene attacking a portion of the tumour which the operator had been unable to reach ; nor can the propriety of operating in general be denied on the score of the disastrous issue of the latter, for from the size of the tumour— sixteen applications of the trepan, an interval of one or two lines being left between each pair of circles besides, were required—the case was unusually unfavourable for operation. As to the opinions of writers on the point, we find Boyer recommending extirpation in but a very few cases ; Delpech rejecting it altoge- ther ; Richerand advising it only when the growth is seated at the upper part of the head ; Velpeau confining it to tumours with a narrow base and which only require removal of the bone without implication of the dura mater. There can be no doubt of the theo- retical propriety of the last opinion, and in the instances of sub-pericranial and cranial cancer it may be carried out in practice, as it is not impossible to distinguish these from the more deeply seated forms. But we have al- ready stated that there is no diagnostic mark whereby fungous protrusions growing from the internal surface of the dura mater or deeper parts may be distinguished from those springing from the external surface of the former texture. If, however, upon removing the surrounding bone the operator should dis- cover that the deep surface of the dura, or even the pia mater were involved, Cruveilhier and Velpeau both agree in the propriety of removing these membranes ; in fact, where the operation has advanced so far, there seems no other course left to be adopted. If the operation be determined on, the in- vesting skin should be divided by a conical incision and the flaps dissected back sufficient- ly far to allow of the application of the tre- phine round the tumour. If there be any un- sound skin, this should be carefully removed ; but it is important that as much as possible be retained for covering the exposed dura mater or brain. For a particular description of the steps of the operation we must refer to the articles Head, Trephine. Berard per- formed his operation on two successive days : on the first occasion three quarters of an hour were occupied in applying the trepan six times ; on the second, an hour and a half in the remaining ten applications. This mode of dividing the operation might be imitated where the growth is very large ; but such dimensions undoubtedly form a special contra- indication to its performance. The extensive exposure of meningeal surface is one of the most serious obstacles to success : a writer in the Gazette Medicate, commenting on this, enquires whether it might not be remedied by autoplasty. A remarkable circumstance at- tending Berard’s operation was, that on the removal of the mass, the ordinary symptoms of compression of the brain came on ; the pa- tient was restored to consciousness by firm pressure on the part of the hemisphere cor- responding to the seat of the fungus. This physiological fact may be usefully compared with Magendie’s experiments on the cephalo- rachidian fluid. Bibliography.—Kavffmann, De Tnmore Capitis Fuugoso. Helmst. 1743.

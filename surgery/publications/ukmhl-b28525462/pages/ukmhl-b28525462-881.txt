This view is con- siderably strengthened by the danger arising to the child after the birth of its head has allowed considerable diminution to take place in the capacity of the uterus, and by the ob- servations of Joerg, of Leipsic, in the effects of too rapid birth. On these grounds this view is worthy of further investigation. Leaving this point then for further obser- vation and inquiry, we can easily understand how the placenta is separated after the birth of the child. Ruysch supposed that the an- nular fibres around the orifices of the Fallopian tubes were formed for the purpose of throw- ing off the placenta; but we know that the mass is separated quite as soon when it is situated beyond the extent of these fibres. It is a body entirely passive, unable to adapt itself to the volume of the surface to which it is attached ; this is diminished by the con- tractions of the uterus after the expulsion of the child ; and the placenta being necessarily separated passes to the most depending part of the uterus ; a new contraction is excited, and it is passed into the vagina, and followed by the membranes. If the vagina has not had its sensibility greatly lessened by the exten- sion and compression during labour, the irri- tation arising from the presence of the secun- dines excites contractions of the diaphragm, abdominal and perineal muscles, by means of which the deliverance is completed. Dr. John Clarke made some observations on the length of time nature required to effect com- plete deliverance, and found that the average was twenty-five minutes. A small quantity of blood, either fluid or in clots, invariably accompanies or follows the secundines, but is generally not more than is contained in the uterine sinuses. This process admits of some varieties with- out being rendered thereby abnormal. Thus, if the centre of the placenta be detached be- fore the edges, blood will be effused into the cavity so formed, and a large clot come away enveloped in the membranes ; or remain some time, excite new uterine contractions, and be, in its turn, expelled. Again, the period elapsing between the expulsion of the child and that of the placenta may vary considera- bly. Sometimes the attendant finds it in the bed before he has had time to separate the infant, while in other cases it remains for hours; and if it be merely detained in the vagina this would not constitute a form of un- natural deliverance. With the exception of the statement of Dr. Clarke, just quoted, the only statement we have met with, as to the time elapsing when the process is left entirely to nature, is by Dr. Harvie, to the following effect:—“ My pupils, who deliver many poor women, according to my instructions, have of late left the delivery of the placenta entirely to nature. In general it comes away soon ; but if, after waiting an hour, there be no un- usual discharge, they order the woman to be carefully put to bed, and then leave her. In such cases I have not known of any placenta that has remained longer than nineteen hours; and all the women thus treated have reco- vered to great advantage1.” I regret that I have not kept an account of the cases I have personally attended with reference to this point; but should consider a quarter of an hour as a fair average, as far as one can judge from recollection. The following tables, with which I have been favoured by Dr. Churchill, of Dublin, show the interval between the birth of the child and the completion of deliverance, under ordinary treatment; that is to say, the placenta is removed as soon as it has passed from the uterus into the vagina.

Very various opinions have been entertained with regard to the duties of the accoucheur between the birth of the child and the expul- sion of the secundines. It does not appear, from the writings of Hippocrates, that any means were taken to expedite deliverance; and when the placenta was retained, though 1 Practical Directions, showing a method of pre- serving the Perineum in birth, and delivering the Pla- centa without violence.

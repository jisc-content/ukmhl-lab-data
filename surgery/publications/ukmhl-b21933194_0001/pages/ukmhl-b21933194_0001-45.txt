17 PYOGENIC BACTERIA. they are brought about by the action of one or other of the organisms wliich we have now to consider. It is found that the s^tajihylococci, which cluster into groups, tend to produce localised lesions; while the chain-forms— streptococci—give rise to diffuse, spreading conditions. Many varieties of pyogenic bacteria have now been differentiated, the best known being the staphylococcus aureus, the streptococcus, and the bacillus coli communis.

Staphylococcus Aureus.—This is the commonest organism found in localised inflammatory and suppurative conditions. It varies greatly in its virulence, and is found in such widely different conditions as skin pustules, boils, carbuncles, and some acute inflammations of bone. As seen by the microscope it occurs in grape - like clusters, flssion of the individual cells taking place irregularly (Fig. 1). It grows very readily in artificial media, such as agar, on the surface of which it forms a brilliant orange film, or on gelatin, which it liquefies, the organisms forming an orange-yellow deposit at the bottom of the tube— VOL. 1—2

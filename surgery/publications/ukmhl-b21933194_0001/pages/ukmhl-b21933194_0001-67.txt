39 PREVENTION OF WOUND INFECTION. open method. This consists in packing the wound witli iodo- foi’m gauze, which is left in position as long as it adheres to the raw surface. The packing may be renewed at intervals until the wound is filled by granulations; or in the course of a few days, when it becomes evident that the septic infection has been overcome, secondary sutures may be introduced and the edges drawn together, provision being made at the ends for further packing or for drainage-tubes. These measures have been found specially useful in military surgery. If earth or street dirt has entered the wound, before intro- ducing the iodoform gauze, the surface may with advantage be brushed over with pure.carbolic acid, as virulent organisms, such as those of tetanus or spreading gangrene, are liable to be present. When septic processes have become established in a wound, and suppuration is going on and probably spreading in the tissues, the first essential in treatment is to ensure free drainage by openings and counter-openings, if necessary. The open method is the only safe means of treating such wounds. The infected surface may be sponged over with pure carbolic acid, the excess of which is washed off with absolute alcohol, and the wound either drained by tubes or packed with iodoform gauze. The [)ractice of scraping such surfaces with the sharp spoon, squeezing, or even of washing them out with antiseptic lotions, is attended with the risk of further diffusing the organisms in the tissue, and is only to be employed under exceptional circumstances. Continuous irrigation of septic wounds or their immersion in antiseptic baths is sometimes useful. Wounds in the vicinity of the mouth or rectum are treated on the same principles as infected wounds—by the open method.

506 INJUKIES OF WRIST AND HAND. chipping off the palmar part of the articular surface. The rest of the metacarpal slips backward, forming a prominence on the dorsal aspect of the joint. The pain and swelling in the region of the fracture often prevent crepitus being W elicited, and as the deformity is not at ji once evident the nature of the injury is w|k liable to be overlooked. The fracture is v|l readily recognised by the use of the X-rays. !|| It may occur in either hand, but on account „ , of the greater exi30sure of the right hand Fracture of Base of “jury it IS commoner on that side. Metacarpal of Thumb. The importance of making a correct dia- gnosis lies in the fact that unless properly treated this injury frequently results in prolonged, or even permanent impairment of function, full abduction and fine movements requiring ’close opposition of the thumb being specially interfered with. The treatment consists in reducing the fracture by extension, and applying an accurately fitting pad over the ex- tremity of the dis- placed bone, main- tained in jiosition by a light angular splint (Fig. 157). This splint is first fixed to the ex- tended and abducted thumb, and while extension is made by pushing it down- wards the upper end is fixed to the wrist (Fig. 158, a). The apparatus is worn for three weeks, being carefully re- adjusted from time to time to maintain the extension. A moulded poroplastic splint applied on the same principle may be employed (Fig. 158, b). Massage and movement should be commenced within a few days of the injury. Fractures of phalanges usually result from direct violence.

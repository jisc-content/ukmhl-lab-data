The injuries met with in the region of the shoulder include fractures and dislocations of the clavicle, fractures of the scapula, dislocations and sprains of the shoulder-joint, and fractures of the upjier end of the humerus. Surgical Anatomy.—For the examination of an injury in the region of the shoulder the patient should he seated on a low stool or chair. After inspecting the parts from the front, the surgeon stands behind thi patient and systematically examines by palpation the shoulder girdle and upper end of the humerus. The uninjured side should be examined along with the other for purposes of comparison. Immediately external to the supra-sternal notch, the sterno-clavicular articulation may be felt, the large end of the clavicle jirojecting heyond the margins of the small and shallow articular surface on the sternum. Any dislocation of this joint is at once recognised. The clavicle being subcutaneous throughout its whole length, any irregularity in its out- line can be easily detected. A small tubercle (deltoid tubercle) which frequently exists near the acromial end is liable to be mistaken for a fracture. The outer end forms with the acromion the acromio- clavicular joint, which, however, is not always readily recognised. The fingers are now carried over the acromion, which often exhibits a prominent ridge in the situation of its epiphysial cartilage, which must not be mistaken for a fracture. The tip of the acromion is usually employed as a fixed point in measuring the length of the arm. The outline of the spine of the scapula can be traced back to the vertebral border ; and the body of the bone may be manipulated, and its movements tested by moving the arm. The coracoid process can be recognised in the ujiper and outer angle

540 INJURIES IN REGION OE KNEE AND LEG. The knee is an example of a joint which depends- for its strength chiefly on its ligaments. Not only are the external and internal lateral ligaments and the posterior part of the capsular ligament par- ticularly strong, but the crucial ligaments and the semilunar cartilages inside the cavity of the joint, further add to its stability. The powerful tendon of the quadriceps extensor muscle, in which the patella is develojied as a sesamoid bone, protects and strengthens the front of the joint. The synovial cavity extends from the level of the head of the tibia Fig. 188.â€”Section of Knee-Joint showing extent of Synovial Cavity. a, Prepatellar bursa. 6, Infra-patellar bursa, c, Ligamentum mucosmn. d, Liga- mentum patellre. e, Posterior crucial ligament. /, Internal semilunar cartilage. (After Braune.) to an inch or more above the trochlear surface of the femur, passing slightly higher on the inner asjiect of the joint than on the outer (Fig. 188). The large bursa between the quadriceps muscle and the femur {sub-crural bursa) generally communicates with the cavity of the joint. The synovial cavity of the superior tibio-fibular articulation is usually distinct from that of the knee-joint, but may communicate with it through the popliteal bursa.

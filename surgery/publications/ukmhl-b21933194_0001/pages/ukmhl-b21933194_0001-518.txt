480 INJUEIES OF ELBOW AND FOREABM. Fig. 135.—Horse-slioe-sliaped Ad- hesive Plaster, with Elastic Tub- ing for Fracture of Olecranon. Fig.134.—Gooch Splint for Fracture of Olecranon. Note “carry- ing angle.” of the axilla to the finger-tips, and cut to the shape of the extended limb (Fig. 134), is then applied anteriorly and fixed in position by a bandage, the region of the elbow being again covered in by a convergent spica. When the dis- placement is great, the fragments may be approximated by elastic extension. A large horse - shoe - shaped piece of ad- hesive plaster (Fig. 135) is applied to the back of the arm to make traction on the triceps, and is so arranged that it embraces the upper fragment. Attached to the plaster is a piece of strong elastic tubing. A bandage is then applied to the hand and forearm, and above the elbow is made to include the plaster and fix it in position. An anterior splint (Fig. 134) which is long enough to project a few inches beyond the finger- tips is next applied, and to the end of this the elastic tubing is fixed (Fig. 136). Some surgeons prefer to fix the elastic to the cuff of a strong dogskin glove applied to the hand. The extension apparatus is worn for about a week, after which massage and movement are commenced, and the arm is gradually flexed. When the fracture has been treated by pro- longed immobilisation, in the extended position, stiffness of the joint per- sists for a considerable time, and may prove very intract- able. Operative Treatment.—A semilunar incision with its base above the tip of the olecranon is carried through the skin and fascia. The fracture is exposed, the joint cavity opened up and cleared of clots, and silver-wire sutures passed through the fragments without encroaching upon the articular cartilage, The limb Pig. 136.—Anterior Splint, with Extension by means of Adhesive Plaster and Elastic Tubing for Fracture of Olecranon.

134 BACTERIAL & OTHER WOUND INFECTIONS. colony is made up of a series of thin, interlacing, and branching filaments, some of which are broken up so as to form masses or chains of cocci; and around the periphery of the colony are elongated, pear-shaped, hyaline, chib-like bodies (Fig. 32). Infection is believed to be conveyed by the husks of cereals, especially barley; and the oi’ganism has been found adhering to particles of grain embedded in the tissues of animals suffering from the disease. In human subjects there is often a history of Fig. 32. ^Colony of Actinomyces. x 400 diam. a = Filaments of streiitotlirix actiiioniyces. 6--Pus cells. exposure to infection from such sources, and the disease is said to be most common during the harvesting months. Around each colony of actinomyces is a zone of granulation tissue in which suppuration usually occurs, so that the fungus comes to lie in a bath of greenish-yellow pus. As the process spreads these purulent foci become confluent and form abscess cavities. When metastasis takes place, as it occasionally does, the fungus is transmitted by the blood-vessels, as in pyaemia. Clinical Features.—In man the disease may be met with in

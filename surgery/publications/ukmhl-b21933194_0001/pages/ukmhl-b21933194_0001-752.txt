714 DISEASES OF INDIVIDUAL JOINTS. that of the tibia abuts on the surface immediately above the reflection of the synovial membrane (Fig. 207). The astragalus is related to three articulations—the ankle above, the astragalo- scaphoid joint in front, and the calcaneo-astragaloid joint below. The close proximity of the tendon sheaths to the ankle exposes them to the spread of infective disease from the joint; this is specially true of the sheaths of the peronei and of the tibialis posticus. Tuberculous Dis- ease. — Tuberculous disease at the ankle is as frequently met with in adolescents and adults as it is in children. Inthemajor- ity of cases it com- mences in the synovial membrane. Gross lesions in the bones are comparatively rare, and are more often met with in the head and neck of the astragalus than in the lower ends of the tibia and fibula. Primary synovial disease usually exhibits the features of white swelling, anteriorly, projecting beneath the extensor tendons, and posteriorly, filling up the hollows on either side of the tendo Achillis. At a later stage the swelling is seen also below the malleoli (Fig. 273). The foot may retain its normal attitude, or the toes may be slightly jjointed and adducted. The calf muscles are wasted, there is little complaint of pain, and the movements of the joint may be so little interfered with that the patient can walk without limping. When the articular surfaces have become affected, there is the usual jiain and sensitiveness, the normal movements are restricted or abolished, and the patient is unable to put the heel to the ground. Primary disease in the bones may cause enlargement of one Fig. 27-3.—Tuberculous Disease of Synovial Membrane of Left Ankle, in a girl a?t. 15.

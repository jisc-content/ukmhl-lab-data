484 INJURIES OF ELBOW AND FOREAEM. Clinical Features.—The elbow is held fixed at an angle of about 120°, pronated or midway between pronation and supina- tion (Fig. 138). Any attempt at movement causes great pain, and is followed by an elastic rebound to the abnormal position. The antero-posterior diameter of the joint is increased, and the forearm, as measured from the external condyle to the tip of the styloid process of the radius, is shortened to the extent of about an inch. If examined before swelling ensues, the outlines of the articular surfaces may be recognised in their abnormal positions, but swelling usually comes on rapidly, and, by obscur- ing the bony landmarks of the joint, renders the dia- gnosis difficult. This injury has to be diagnosed from supra-con- dylar fracture with back- ward displacement, and from separation of the lower humeral epiphysis. A general anaesthetic is often necessary to enable an accurate diagnosis to be made. When the deformity is once reduced, there is no tendency to its I’eproduction unless the coronoid process is at the same time fractured. In a considerable number of cases—according toE. H. Fig. 140.—Backward and outward Di.s- Bennett, in the majority location of Bones of Forearm on Left —this dislocation is incom- f-Side, in a boy *t. 10. plete, the coronoid process resting at the level of the trochlea, and the backward projection of the olecranon being scarcely appreciable. The head of the radius, however, is unduly prominent. In such cases the lesion is liable to be overlooked, and therefore to go untreated, leading to permanent impairment of function of the joint. Dislocation forward is much less common than the backward variety. It is produced by severe force acting from behind on the flexed elbow, the ulna being driven forward, tearing the ligaments of the joint and the muscles attached to the condyles. The olecranon process is frequently fractured at the same time.

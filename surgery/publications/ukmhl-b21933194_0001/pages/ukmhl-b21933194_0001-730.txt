DISEASES OF INDIVIDUAL JOINTS. 692 flexion enables him to save the limb to the utmost extent; on the other hand, if he uses a crutch, as he is obliged to do at a more advanced stage, he no longer uses the limb for support, but draws it upwards and inwards into the position of adduction, inversion, and greater flexion. Similarly, if he is confined to bed he lies on the sound side, and the affected limb sinks by gravity so as to lie over the normal one- in the position of adduction, inversion, and flexion. Kdnig’s explanation accords with the fact that in the exceptional cases which begin with adduction and inversion we have usually to deal with a more severe type of the disease, associated with grave osseous lesions — precisely those cases in which the patient is compelled from the outset to lie up or to adopt the use of crutches. Further, the transi- tion from the abducted to the ad- ducted position is usually associated with such an aggravation of the symptoms that the patient is no longer able to walk without assist- ance. During the third stage the other signs and symptoms become more pronounced; the patient becomes pale and thin ; he is usually unable to leave his bed; his sleep is dis- turbed by startings of the limb ; and the rigidity of the joint and the Fig. 264.—Advanced Tuber- wasting of the muscles are very culous Disease of Right Hip- marked.

Marked elevation of the temperature, apart from septic complications, usually indicates the development of tubercle elsewhere, or of general tuberculosis. Abscess Formation in Hip Disease.—The formation of abscess is not related to any particular stage of the disease. It may occur before there is any deformity, or it may be deferred until the disease has apparently recovered. Its chief import-

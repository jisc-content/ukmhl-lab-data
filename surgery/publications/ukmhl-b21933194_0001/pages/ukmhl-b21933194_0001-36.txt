REPAIR. Repair of Mioscle.—Neither unstriped nor striped muscle seems to be capable of being regenerated to any but a moderate degree. If the ends of a divided muscle be at once brought into apposition by stitches, primary union takes place with a minimum of intervening fibrous tissue. The nuclei of the muscle fibres in close proximity to this young cicatricial tissue proliferate, and a few new muscle fibres may be developed, but any gross loss of muscular tissue is replaced by a fibrous cicatrix. It would appear that portions of muscle transplanted from animals to fill up gaps in human muscle are similarly replaced by fibrous tissue. When a muscle is paralysed from loss of its nerve-supply and undergoes complete degeneration, it is not capable of being regenerated, even should the integrity of the nerve be restored, and so its function is permanently lost. The Repair of Blood -vessels is described at p. 255. Regeneration of Secretory Glands.—The regeneration of secretory glands, such as the salivary glands,' liver, and kidney, is usually incomplete. The greater part of a gap left iir such organs is filled by cicatricial tissue, but in some—for example, the liver and kidney — the epithelial cells of the remaining glandular tissue proliferate, and a certain degree of regeneration takes place. Regeneration of Intestine and other Composite Structures,—^ Composite structures like the intestine, the oesophagus, the bladder, or the urethra, are repaired by the formation of cicatricial tissue, each constituent element behaving after the manner of its kind. Thus the muscular and glandular tissues are not reproduced, while the fibrous, vascular, and lining epithelial elements are. Regeneration of Nerve Tissues. — There is no trustworthy evidence that regeneration of the tissues of the brain or spinal cord in man ever takes place. Any loss of substance is replaced by cicatricial tissue. The Regeneration of Peripheral Nerves is described at page 329.

FRACTURES OF THE NECK OF THE FEMUR. 525 limb is prevented by fixing the lower end of the splint in a foot-rest. In restless patients it is an advantage to apply a long s[)lint to the sound leg in addition, and to connect the two splints by a cross-bar below. Eversion may be corrected by sand-bags placed alongside the limb, or by means of a piece of wood fixed to the back of the knee at right angles to the axis of the limb by a few turns of plaster-of-Paris bandage. It is impoi’tant also to keep the bed- clothes clear of the foot Ijy means of a cage. The retentive apparatus is worn for about six weeks, after which the patient is allowed to move about with the aid of crutches. In exceptional cases, recourse may be had to accurate fixation of the fragments to one another by means of a long steel peg in- troduced through the skin over the great trochanter, and passed so as to transfix the two frag- ments ; or the fragments may be exposed by an open operation and sutured together with silver wire, the torn capsule being stitched with catgut. Hodgeii’s sjolint (Fig. 180) is one of the most comfortable and efficient means of treating these fractures, as it allows the }>atient a certain amount of movement, and facilitates nursing. Asa temporary means of secur- ing the limb—for example, while the patient is being transported to hospital—extension may be obtained by means of a 'perineal hand attached to Liston’s long splint (Fig. 175). The patient’s foot, carefully padded, is fixed to the lower end of the splint by means of a bandage or tri- angular handkerchief. By pushing the splint down traction is made upon the limb, and this is maintained by means of a padded triangular bandage passed through the perineum and fixed to the upper end of the splint. This method is less efficient and more uncomfortable than that by weight and pulley.

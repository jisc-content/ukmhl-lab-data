A curved incision, with its convexity towards the sole, is made on the inner aspect; tlie hap of skin is rehected upwards, the ljursa excised, the bone bared of soft parts, and its articular portion removed. If the toe still tends to be abducted, the contracted outer })ortiou of the capsule of the joint is divided, the displaced sesamoids are removed, and the tendon of the long extensor may he detached from its insertion into the terminal phalanx and stitched to the hbrous tissues on the inner side of the proximal phalanx. Jo prevent stiffness, movements must be persistently carried out. Hallux Varus or Pigeon-toe.—In this deformity which is extremely rare, the great toe deviates from the middle line of the Fig. 303.—Hallux Rigidus and Flexus in a boy let. 17. There is a sujipurating corn over the head of the first metatarsal bone. foot; it is met with chiefly in children in conjunction with other deformities. It interferes with the wearing of boots. Treatment consists in straightening the toe and retaining it in position by a splint or plaster of Paris. The internal lateral ligament and the tendon of the abductor hallucis may require to be divided srdrcutaneously. Hallux Rigidus and Hallux Flexus (Fig. 303).—These terms indicate two stages of an affection of the metatarso- phalangeal joint of the great toe, first described by Ida vies Colley. In the earlier stage—haiku: rigidus—the toe is stiff and incapable of being dorsi-Hexed, although plantar-flexion is, as a rule, but little restricted. When the joint, in addition to being stiff, is painful, sensitive and swollen, the term hallux, dolorosus is applied.

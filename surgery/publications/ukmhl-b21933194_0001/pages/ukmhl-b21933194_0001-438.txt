The bursa between the tendo Achillis and the upper.part 'of the os calcis may become inflamed —especially as a result of post-scarlatinal rheumatism or gonor- rhoea. The affection is known as Achillo-bursitis. There is severe pain in the region of the insertion of the tendo Achillis, and the movements at the ankle-joint are restricted and the patient may be unable to walk. There is a tender swelling on either side of Fig. 93.—Gouty Disease of Bursie iii a tailor. The The bursa which bursal tumpurs were almost entirely composed is sometimes met calcis—the suhcalcanean hursa—when inflamed, gives rise to marked local pain and tenderness in the sole of the foot. This affection may be associated with a spinous projection from the bone, which is capable of being recognised in a skiagram. The soft parts of the heel are turned forwards as a flap, the bursa is dissected out, and the projection of bone, if present, is removed. The enlargement of adventitious bursae over the head of the first metatarsal in hallux valgus; over the tarsus, metatarsus, and digits in the different forms of club-foot; over the angular projection in Pott’s disease of the spine; over the end of the bone in amputation stumps, and over hard tumours such as chondroma and osteoma, are described elsewhere. the tendon. When, in spite of palliative treatment, the afi’ec- tion persists or re- lapses, it is best to excise the bursa. The tendo Achillis is detached from the os calcis, the bursa dissected out, and the tendon re- placed. If there is a bony projection from the os calcis, as sometimes occurs, it should be shaved off with the chisel. of urate of soda. with on the under aspect of the os

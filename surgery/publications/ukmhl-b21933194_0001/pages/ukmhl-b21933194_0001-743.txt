706 THE KNEE-JOINT. Tuberculous Disease. Wliile specially common in childhood and youth, tnherculous disease of the knee may occur at any i)eriod of life, and is not uncommon in patients over fifty. The frequency with which the disease originates in the synovial membrane and in the bones respectively would appear to be about ecpial. Wlien the synovial membrane is diseased, it tends to grow inwards over the articular surfaces (Fig. 269). In the femur this usually takes place from the lateral margins of the condyles at the level of the lower edge of the patella, often shutting off Ficj. 269. — Tuberculous Synoviaf Membrane of Knee, spreailing over articular surface of femur. the supra-patellar pouch and fixing the knee-cap to the femur. In the tibia and patella the synovial membrane grows in from the margins, diminishing the area of their articular surfaces. The ingrowth of synovial membrane may fill up the entire cavity of the joint, or may divide it up into compartments, one usually Ijeing above the patella, and two in relation to the condyles of the femur. When, under these conditions, a tuberculous focus in the bone erupts into the joint, the infection may be confined to one or other of these compartments. FTlceration of the cartilage and caries of the articular surfaces are brought about in the same way as in other joints. VOL. I—45

564 INJURIES IN REGION OF KNEE AND LEG. Compound fractwres are treated on the lines already laid down for the treatment of compound fractures in general. Fracture of the tibia alone is almost always due to direct violence or to a twist of the foot. As the fracture is transverse there is little displacement, and as the intact fibula retains the fragments in position, union takes place rapidly and without deformity. Oblique fracture from indirect violence is extremely rare. Fracture of the fibula alone may result from direct violence, and, on account of the support given by the tibia, is usually un- attended by displacement or deformity. Bennett, of Dublin, has pointed out that it is common to meet with an oblique fracture of the upper third of the fibula as the result of an outward twist of the ankle while the foot is extended. This fracture is characterised by pain localised at the seat of the break, on moving the foot in such a way as to bring the astragalus to bear against the fibula. Local pressure also may make the fibula yield and may elicit crepitus. In some cases this fracture is associated with injuries in the region of the ankle-joint. This fracture is very often overlooked, and from want of proper treatment results in prolonged impairment of usefulness of the limb. Treatment.â€”Fractures of the tibia or fibula alone are treated on the same lines as fractures of both bones. The ambulant method of treatment is particularly useful in these cases (Fig. 210).

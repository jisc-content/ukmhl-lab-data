327 TUMOUKS OF LYMPHATIC GLANDS. as a sarcoma starting in lymphatic glands. It appears in the neck, axilla, or mediastinum, as a rapidly growing tumour con- sisting of one enlarged gland with numerous satellites. As the tumour increases in size, the sarcomatous tissue erupts through the capsule of the glands, and infiltrates the surrounding tissues, whereby it becomes fixed to these and to the skin. The only treatment is early excision, but the results are most disappointing. Secondary Tumours.—Next to tuberculosis, secondary cancer is the most common and most important disease of lymphatic glands. In the neck it is met with in association with epitheli- oma of the lip, tongue, or throat. The glands form tumours of variable size, and are often larger than the primary growth, the characters of which they reproduce. The glands are at first hard and movable, but soon become fixed, and in time they soften, liquefy, and burst through the skin, forming foul, fungat- ing ulcers. A similar affection is met with in the groin from epithelioma of the penis, scrotum, or vulva. In cancer of the breast, the affection of the axillary glands is an important complication. In pigniejited or melanotic cancers of the skin, the glands are early infected and increase rapidly, so that when the primary growth is still of small size—as, for example, on the sole of the foot—the femoral glands may already constitute large pigmented tumours. The implication of the glands in other sites and varieties of cancer will be considered with regional surgery. Secondary sarcoma is seldom met with in glands except when the primary growth is situated in the tonsil, thyroid, or testicle.

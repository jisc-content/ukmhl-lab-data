154 CHAPTER X. SYPHILIS. Definition.—Virus.—Acquired Syphilis—Primary period: Inmhation, •primary chancre, glandular enlargement, extra-genital chancres— Treatment—Secondary period : General symptoms, skin affections, mucous patches, affections of hones, joints, eyes, etc.—Treatment: Methods of administering mercury—Syphilis and marriage—Inter- mediate stage—Reminders—Tertiary period : General symptoms, gummata, tertiary ulcers, tertiary lesions of skin, mucous membrane, hones, joints, etc.—Second attacks.—Inherited Syphilis—Trans- mission—Gl'inical features in infancy, in later life—Contagiousness —-Treatment. Syphilis is an infective disease due to the entrance into the body of a specific virus; it is nearly always communicated from one individual to another by contact infection, the discharge from a syphilitic lesion being the medium through which the virus is transmitted. It belongs to the group of diseases known as the infective granulomata, a group which includes tuberculosis, actinomycosis, glanders, and leprosy. Syphilis may be described as a chronic inflammation attended with the formation of granulation tissue which has certain structural peculiarities and degenerative tendencies. Syphilitic granulation tissue is made up of round cells, epithelioid cells, and giant cells, so like those met with in tuberculous lesions that a differential diagnosis based on histo- logical structure alone cannot be relied upon. It may be possible, however, to distinguish tuberculous from syphilitic granulation tissue by demonstrating tubercle bacilli in the former. When syphilis is communicated from one individual to another by contact infection, the condition is spoken of as acquired syphilis, and the first visible sign of the disease aj^pears at the site of inoculation, and is known as the primary lesion. Those who have thus acquired the disease may transmit it to their offspring, who are then said to suffer from inherited syphilis.

Sometimes the skin is invaded by the mevoid tissue over the whole extent of the tumour, sometimes only over a limited area (Fig. 63). Fre- quently the margin only is of a bright-red colour, while the skin over the centre of the swelling resembles a cicatrix. The swelling can be reduced by steady pressure. It increases in size and becomes tense when the child cries. Prognosis.—-The rate of growth of the subcutaneous and mixed forms of mevi varies greatly.

There is a decided tendency to spontaneous

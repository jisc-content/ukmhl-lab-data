Surgical Anatomy—Fkactures of Lower End of Femur: Supra- condylar; T- ox y-shaped ; Separation of epiphysis ; Either condyle —Fracture.s of Uri’ER End of Tibia: Of head; Separation of epiphysis; Avulsion of tubercle of tibia—Dislocation.s of Knee: Dislocations of superior tibio - fbular joint — Internal Derange- ments OF Knee—Injuries of Patella : Fractures ; Dislocations— Injuries of Leg : Fracture of both bones ; Fracture of tibia alone ; Fracture of fibula alone. Injuries in the Region of the Knee. These include the supra-condylar fracture of the femur, the T- or Y -shaped fracture opening into the joint, separation of the lower femoral epiphysis ; fracture of the head of the tibia, and separation of its upper epiphysis; the various dislocations and sprains of the knee, as well as its internal derangements ; and fractures and di.slocations of the patella. Surgical Anatomy.—Of tlie two condyles tlie internal is the more prominent and palpable. On its upper edge is situated the adductor tubercle, which gives attachment to the round tendon of the adductor magnus, and which marks the level of the epiphysial line, and of the upper limit of the trochlear surface of the femur. Between the internal condyle and the inner tuberosity of the tibia, when the limb is in the flexed position, the line of the joint can be recognised as a groove or cleft, and this is made use of in measuring the length of the tibia. The outer tuberosity of the tibia can also be palpated, and must not be mistaken for the head of the fibula, which lies farther back and at a slightly lower level, and can readily be identified by tracing to it the tendon of the biceps. The tubercle of the tibia, into which the quadriceps extensor tendon is inserted, lies on the same level as the head of the fibula. In the extended position of the limb, the patella is loose and movable on the front of the trochlear surface of the femur, while in the flexed position it sinks between the condyles, resting chiefly on the outer one and becoming fixed. The popliteal artery and vein and the internal popliteal nerve lie in close relation to the jiosterior aspect of the joint ; and the external popliteal nerve passes behind and to the inner side of the biceps tendon.

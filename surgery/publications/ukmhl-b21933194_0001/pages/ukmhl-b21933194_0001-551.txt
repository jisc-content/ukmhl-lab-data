513 FRACTURE OF THE PELVIS. He should be put to bed on a firm mattress. Some surgeons prefer a mattress made in three pieces, for convenience in using the bed-pan and for the prevention of bed-sores, but we have never found this to be of any service in practice. Before the treatment of the fracture is commenced the surgeon must satisfy himself, by the use of the catheter and by other means, that the urethra and bladder are intact. Should these or any other of the pelvic viscera be damaged, these injuries must receive the first attention. The treatment of the fracture itself consists in adjusting the fragments, as far as possible by manipulation, applying a firm binder or many-tailed bandage round the pelvis, and fixing the knees together by a bandage (Fig. 164). Fro. 164.—Maiiy-tailed Bandage and Binder for Fracture of Pelvic Girdle. In some cases extension may be applied to both legs, with the limbs abducted and fixed by sand-bags. Compound fractures, being commonly associated with extra- vasation of urine, are liable to septic complications. Loose fragments should be removed, as they are prone to undergo necrosis. The patient is confined to bed for six or eight weeks, and it may be several weeks more before he is able to resume active employment. The acetabulum may be fractured by force transmitted through the femur, from a fall on the feet, the knees, or the great trochanter. It may merely be fissured, or the head of the femur may be forcibly driven through its floor into the pelvic cavity, either by fracturing the bone, or, in young VOL. I—33

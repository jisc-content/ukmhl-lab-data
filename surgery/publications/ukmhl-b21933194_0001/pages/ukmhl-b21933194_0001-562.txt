To the lower ends of these are attached broad tapes, to which a stirrup is buckled, and through it traction is made by means of a cord passing over a pulley, the weight varying with the requirements of the case.

The necessary counter-extension is obtained by raising the foot of the bed on blocks. When it is considered necessary to control the joints above and below the fracture, this may be done by means of Lisioris long splint (Fig. 174), which extends from the axilla to two or three inches beyond the foot.

686 DISEASES OF INDIVIDUAL JOINTS. \ by a limp, pain, and restriction of the movements of the joint; the second stage, by abduction and apparent lengthening of the limb; and the third stage, by adduction and apparent or actual shortening. The first of these stages may be absent, or may escape observation; the second is typical of hip disease, but may also be absent in acute cases in which sometimes the attitude from the outset is one of adduction. Recovery often occurs before the dis- ease reaches the third stage, or the treatment adopted may prevent the limb assum- ing the attitude characteristic of this stage. The forma- tion of abscess may take place at any stage. Initial Stage.—^At this stage the disease is confined either to the synovial mem- brane, or to a focus in the bone which has not yet opened freely into the cavity of the joint. The onset is usually very insidious, and if injury is alleged as an exciting cause, some weeks have usually elapsed between the receipt of the injury and the onset of symptoms. In the case of a child, he is usually brought for advice because he has begun to limp and to suflfer pain. The state- ment maybe made that he has become pale, that he has ceased to take food well, that his sleep has been disturbed, and that the pain and the limp, after coming and going for a time, have become more continuous and pronounced. On walking, the affected limb is dragged in such a way as to avoid movement at the hip, and to substitute for it movement of the pelvis. The child throws the weight of the trunk as little as possible on to the affected limb, and inclines to rest on the balls of the toes rather than on the heel. There is usually some wasting of the muscles of the thigh and slight flattening of the buttock.

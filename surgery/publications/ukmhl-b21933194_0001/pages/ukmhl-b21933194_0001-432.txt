394 MUSCLES, TENDONS, & TENDON SHEATHS. Treatment.—Excision of the affected sheath is the only satis- factory treatment. The whole of the diseased area must be exposed by free incision of the overlying soft parts; the sheath is then carefully isolated from the surrounding tissues and cut across above and below. Any tuberculous tissue on the tendon itself is removed with a sharp spoon. Associated bone or joint lesions are dealt with at the same time. In the after-treatment the functions of the tendons must be preserved by voluntary and passive movements. Syphilitic Affections of Tendon Sheaths.—These closely re- semble the syphilitic affections of the synovial membrane of joints. During the secondary period the lesion usually consists in effusion into the sheath; gummata are met with during the tertiary period. Tumours of Tendon Sheaths.—Innocent tumours are very rare. Their clinical features resemble tuberculous disease so closely that the diagnosis is often extremely difficult. The Lipoma, fibroma, and myxoma resemble similar tumours in other situations. Special mention should be made of the myeloma which is met with at the wrist or ankle as an elongated swelling of slow development, or over the phalanx of a finger as a small rounded swelling. The tumour tissue, when exposed by dissection, is of a chocolate or chamois - yellow colour, and consists almost entirely of giant cells. The treatment consists in dissecting the tumour tissue off the tendons, and this is usually successful in bringing about a permanent cure. All varieties of sarcoma are met with, but their origin from tendon sheaths is not associated with any special features. In removing them it may be necessary to sacrifice the tendons or to amputate the limb.

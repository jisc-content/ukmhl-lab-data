466 INJURIES OF SHOULDER AND UPPER ARM. When the fracture is oblique there is considerable tendency for the lower fragment to be re- displaced upward. In such cases care must be taken to avoid sup- porting the elbow by sjslint or sling, and it may even be neces- sary to apply extension to counter- act this tendency (Fig. 122). In cases where the upper fragment remains abducted, or in which the [fracture is oblique or comminuted and redisplacement occurs, the patient may be treated in bed, and extension with weight and pulley carried over the side of the bed; or Middeldor23f’s triangular splint may be used. This consists of a double-inclined plane, the base of which is fixed to the patient’s side, while the injured arm rests on the other two sides of the triangle (Fig. 123). Should these measures fail, the frac- ture may be exposed by an incision carried along the anterior border of the deltoid, and the ends jjegged, wired, or otherwise mechanically fixed, after which the limb is put up in one of the ways already described. The ap- 23aratus should be worn for three or four weeks, massage being commenced on the second or third day. Union is usually complete in about four weeks. Separation of Epiphysis. — The uj^per epi^ihysis of the humerus in- cludes the head, both tuberosities, and the ujjper fourth of the bicipital groove (Fig. 124). On its under asjject is a cup-like depression into which the cen- tral j^yramidal-shai^ed portion of the diaphysis fits. This epii)hysis unites about the twenty-first year.

766 THE DEFOKMITIES OF THE EXTREMITIES. of the pelvis. When this angle is exaggerated the attitude is described as one of cvhitus valgus (Fig. 131). This deformity may be acquired as a result of rickets, but more commonly it is due to a fracture of the external condyle of the humerus, in which the separated fragment has been displaced upwards. Sometimes it is of congenital origin and is associated with great slackness of the ligaments. Cubitus varus (Fig. 130) is the reverse of cubitus valgus. It is more common, and is nearly always a result of fracture of the lower end of the humerus or separation of the epiphysis and thumb and its metacarpal bone are often absent, and the useful- ness of the hand and arm is greatly impaired (Fig. 308). For its treatment Bardenheuer has devised an operation which consists in splitting the lower end of the ulna longitudinally and inserting the proximal bones of the carpus into the cleft. Con- genital deficiency of the ulna is extremely rare. A deformity resembling congenital club-hand is brought about when the growth of either of the bones of the forearm has been arrested as a result of disease or of traumatic separation of its lower epi})hysis. The hand deviates to the side on which the growth has been arrested. The treatment consists in resecting a portion of the longer bone. Dropped Wrist from Infantile Paralysis.—In this condition subsequent interference with growth. These deformities may be cor- rected by supra-con- dylar osteotomy of the humerus. Fia. 308.—Club-liaiul, the result of imperfect development of radius. The thumb is absent. (From a cast in Mr. Annandale’s collection.) Deformities of the Forearm and Hand.— The radius may be absent completely or in part, frequently in combination with other malformations. The most evident result is a deviation of the hand to the radial side—one variety of club-hand (manus vara). The forearm is shortened, the ulna is thickened and often bent, the

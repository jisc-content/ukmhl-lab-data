GANGRENE. 112 used to purify the skin, such as turpentine, ether, or strong carbolic solutions, do not collect under the patient and remain in contact with the skin of the sacrum and buttocks during the time he is on the operating-table. There is reason to believe that the so-called “ post-operation bed-sore ” may be due to such causes. A similar result has been known to follow soiling of the sheets by the escape of a turpentine enema. Treatment.—Once a bed-sore has formed, every effort must be made to prevent its spread. Mild antiseptic lotions are used to cleanse the broken surface, and dry absorbent dressings are applied and frequently changed. It is sometimes found necessary to employ moist or oily substances, such as boracic poultices, eucalyptus ointment, or balsam of Peru, to facilitate the separation of sloughs, or to promote the growth of granulations. In patients who are not extremely debilitated the slough may be excised, the raw surface scraped and then painted with undiluted carbolic acid. Skin-grafting is sometimes useful in covering in the large raw surface left after separation or removal of sloughs.

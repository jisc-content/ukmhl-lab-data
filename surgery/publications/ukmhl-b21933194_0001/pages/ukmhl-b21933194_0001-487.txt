DISLOCATIONS OF THE CLAVICLE. 449 the following methods have proved the most satisfactory :—(1) As a temporary means of retention in emergency cases, for example, accidents occurring on the football field, the handkerchief method (p. 448). (2) In uncomplicated fractures of average severity in any part of the bone, the method of Wharton Hood (p. 446). (3) In cases where, for sesthetic reasons, the chief consideration is the avoidance of deformity and the maintenance of the symmetry of the shoulders, as in girls, the treatment by recumbency. (4) When retentive apparatus fails, or when the fragments are exerting injurious pressure, operative treatment. Dislocations of the Clavicle. Dislocation of the acromial end—sometimes, and perhaps more correctly, spoken of as dislocation of the scapula—is Fig. 111.—Dislocation of Acromial End of Left Clavicle upwards. more frequent than that at the sternal end, and it usually results from a blow from behind, or from a fall on the tip of the shoulder, driving down the scapula, so that the clavicle projects upwards and overrides the acromion process (Fig. 111).

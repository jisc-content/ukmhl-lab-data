139 CHAPTER IX. TUBERCULOSIS. Definition of tuberculous disease—Tubercle bacilli—Methods of infection —Inherited and ac(juired predisposition—Action of the bacillus upon the tissues—Tuberculous granulation tissue—Natural cure— Recrudescence of the disease—The Tuberculous Abscess—Con- tents and wall of the abscess. The term tuberculosis is applied generically to the various pathological conditions which result from the action of the tubercle bacillus. The diseases lu’oduced by this organism are spoken of as tuberculous, and as this term indicates the essential nature of the affection, it is to be preferred to the terms “ strumous ” and “ scrofulous ” })reviously emiiloyed. Tuberculosis may be met with in any of the tissues or organs of the body, but it occurs more frequently in some situations than in others. It is very common, for example, in lymphatic glands, in bones and joints, in the peritoneum, the intestine, the kidney, prostate and testis, and in the skin and subcutaneous cellular tissue. It is seldom met with in the breast or in muscles, and it rarely affects the ovary, the pancreas, the parotid, or the thyroid. Tubercle bacilli occur as straight or slightly curved rods, measuring about 3 /x by -3 /x (Fig. 34). They have no power of movement. It is as yet undecided whether or not they form spores. Their virulence varies widely, and they are more tenacious of life than the common pyogenic bacteria. In a dry state, for example, they can retain their vitality for months ; and they can also survive immersion in water for prolonged periods. They resist the action of the products of putrefaction for a consider- able time, and are not destroyed by digestive processes in the stomach and intestine. They may be killed in a few minutes by immersion in 1 in 20 carbolic lotion, by boiling, or by exposure to steam under pressure.

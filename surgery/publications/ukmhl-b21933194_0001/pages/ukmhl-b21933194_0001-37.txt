Leucocytosis. The Temperature in Surgical Diseases. The general jirocess of ideal repair, and its modifications in the regeneration of the different tissues which have been studied, are liable to be interrupted or completely arrested by various extraneous influences which it is the duty of the surgeon to prevent or remove. Of such conditions the first is Want of Rest. “The first and great requisite for the restoration of injured parts is rest,” said John Hunter ; and physiological and mechanical rest as the chief of natural therapeutic agents was the theme of John Hilton’s classical work. By “"rest,” in this connection, is meant not merely a state of physical repose, but in addition as complete cessation of all physiological and mechanical function as is })ossible. A tuberculous joint, for example, must be enclosed in splints in such a way as to prevent all movement of its con- stituent bones. An inflamed eye must be protected from the light, in addition to having its movements arrested. To enable the small, painful ulcer of the mucous membrane of the anus, known as anal fissure, to heal, it is not only necessary to prevent the mechanical stretching of the part due to the periodic move- ment of the bowels, but the persistent contractions of the underlying sphincter muscle must be arrested by stretching or cutting its fibres. Another fertile source of inteiyference with repair in surgical wounds is irritation, either by mechanical agents such as rough,

FRACTURES OF LOWER END OF FEMUR. 541 A large bursa {prejyateUar) lies over the lower part of the patella and upper part of the ligamentum patellae ; and a smaller one separates the ligamentum patellae from the tubercle of the tibia. Several important bursae are found in the popliteal space, one of which—the semi-mem- branosus bursa—sometimes communicates with the knee-joint. Fractures of the Lower End op the Femur. Supra-condylar fracture of the femur is u-sually tlie result of a fall on the feet or knees, or of direct violence. It is most common in adults. The line of fracture is generally irregularly transverse, or it may be slightly oblique from above downwards and for- wards, so that the upper fragment passes forward towards the patella, while the lower is rotated back- ward on its transverse axis by the gastrocnemius muscle. The T - or Y-shaped fracture is, as a rule, pro- duced by direct violence, the force first breaking the bone above the condyles, and then causing the ui)per fragment to penetrate the lower and split it up into tw'o or more pieces. The fracture implicates the articular surface, and the main fissure is usually through the inter-condylar notch, and sometimes the low'er end of the bone is severely comminuted. Separation of the lower epiphysis is a comparatively common injury. It is seldom pure, a portion of the diaphysis usually being broken off and remaining attached to the epiphysis. It occurs 189.—Sepaiation of usually in boys between the ages of thirteen and eighteen, as a result of severe violence such as results from the limb being caught between the spokes of a revolving wdieel, or from hyper-extension of the knee. It has also been produced in attempting forcibly to rectify knock-knee and other deformities in this region, and in making traction on the limb in cases of tuberculous disease of the knee. As a rule there is little Low'er Epiphysis Feimir. (After Poland.)

DISLOCATIONS OF THE SHOULDER. 457 The humerus is then rotated inwards by dropping the hand (Fig. 119), and the bone gradually glides into the socket. In a certain number of cases reduction can be effected by hyper- abduction of the shoulder with traction. The patient is laid upon a firm mattress, and the scapula fixed by making pressure on the acromion, while the arm is slowly and steadily extended, and raised from the side till it is well above the head. In some cases the head of the humerus spontaneously slips into its socket; in others it may be manipulated into position by pressure from Fig. 119.—Miller’s Method of reducing Sub-coracoid Dislocation—Second Movement. the axilla. This method is restricted to recent cases, as in those of long standing the axillary vessels are liable to be stretched or torn. The method of reduction by traction on the arm with the heel in the axilla has deservedly fallen into disrepute as being one which largely depends for its success on sheer force. After-Treatment.—After reduction, the part is gently massaged for ten or fifteen minutes, a layer of wool is placed in the axilla, the forearm is supported by a sling, and the arm fixed to the side by a circular bandage. Massage is carried out daily from the first, and movement of the shoulder in every direction

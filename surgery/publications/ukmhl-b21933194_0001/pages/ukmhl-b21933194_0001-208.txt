180 SYPHILIS. Affections of the hones.—Swellings at the ends of the long bones, due to inflaniination at the epiphysial junctions, are most often observed at the upper end of the hum- erus and in the bones in the region of the elbow. Partial dis- placement and mobil- ity at the ossifying junction may be ob- served. The infant cries when the part is touched ; and as it does not move the limb voluntarily, the condition is spoken Fig. 39.—Condylomata of Anus iu an infant pseiuio-pa7- the subject of Inherited Syphilis. alysis of syphilis. (From a photograph lent by Mr. Stiles.) HeCOVery takes place under anti-syphilitic treatment and immobilisation of the limb. Diffuse thickening of the shafts of the long bones due to a deposit of new bone by the periosteum is sometimes met with. In the skull, especially of infants who suffer also from rickets, two characteristic con- ditions may be met with, re- spectively known as Parrot’s nodes or bosses, and cranio- tabes. The bosses (Fig. 40) result from the heaping up of new spongy bone beneath the pericranium, and they may be grouped symmetrically around the anterior fontanelle, or may extend along either side of the sagittal suture, which appears as a deep groove—the “nati- form skull.” The bosses dis appear in time, but the skull may remain permanently altered in shape, the frontal and,parietal eminences often appearing unduly prominent.

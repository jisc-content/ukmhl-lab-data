ULCEEATION AND ULCERS. 76 of as tlie varicose tdcer. Any slight injury or irritation of the devitalised area is liable to permit of septic infection and lead to ulceration. Dermatitis and eczema are common in associa- tion with varicose veins, and the scratching or rubbing of the part is very liable to cause a breach of the surface and j^ermit of infection. Such ulcers may also originate from the bursting of a small peri-phlebitic abscess. Varicose veins in immediate relation to the base of a large chronic ulcer usually become thrombosed, and in time are reduced to fibrous cords, and therefore in such cases heemorrhage is not a com- mon complication. In smaller and more super- ficial ulcers, however, the destructive process is liable to implicate the wall of the vessel before the occurrence of thrombosis, and to lead to profuse and often dangerous bleeding. These ulcers are at first small and superficial, but from want of care, from continued standing or walking, or from injudicious treat- ment, they gradually become larger and deeper. They are not infre- quently multiple, and this, together with their depth, may lead to their being mistaken for syphilitic ulcers. The base of the ulcer is covered with imperfectly formed, soft, cedematous granulations, which give off a thin sero-purulent discharge. The edges are slightly inflamed, and show no evidence of healing. The parts around are usually pigmented and slightly cedematous, and as a rule there is little pain. This variety of ulcer is particularly prone to pass into the condition known as callous. In anoernic patients, especially young girls, ulcers are occa- sionally met with which have many of the clinical characters of those associated with imperfect venous return. They are very slow to heal, and tend to pass into the condition known as weak.

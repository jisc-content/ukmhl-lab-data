342 THE NERVES. the distribution of one or more contiguous nerves or of a plexus of nerves, and it may occur either by itself or along with a generalised neuro-fibromatosis. The clinical features are those of an ill-defined swelling composed of a number of tortuous, convoluted cords, lying in a loose areolar tissue and freely movable on one another. It is rarely the seat of pain or tenderness. It most often appears in the early years of life, sometimes in relation to a pigmented or hairy mole. It is usually subcutaneous, and is fre- quently situated on the head or neck in the distribution of the trigeminal or superficial cervical nerves. The results of excision are satisfactory, even if the removal is not quite complete. The cutaneous neuro-fibroma or molluseum fibrosum has been shown by von Recklinghausen to be a soft fibroma related to the terminal fila- ments of the cutaneous nerves (Eig. 7 4). The disease appears in the form of multiple, soft, projecting tumours of the skin, which are scattered over the body—except on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet—and are frequently associated with pig- mentation of the skin and with multij^le tumours of the nerve-trunks. In exceptional cases one of the skin *‘mata o?“Eh7 * (Folluscum tumours may attain an enormous fibrosum). size and cause a hideous deformity, (After von Recklinghausen.) hanging dowp. by its own weight in lobulated or folded masses (pachy- dermatocele). They are very closely related to the plexiform neuroma, and the skin over them may be pigmented and hairy. The treatment consists in the removal of the larger swellings, but the small multiple tumours rarely call for interference. Elephantiasis neuromatosa is the name applied by Virchow to a condition in which a limb is swollen and misshapen as a result of the extension of a neuro-fibromatosis to the skin and cellular tissue of the extremity as a whole. While it resembles other forms of elephantiasis, it usually begins in early life

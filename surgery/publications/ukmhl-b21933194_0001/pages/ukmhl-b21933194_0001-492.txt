454 INJUKIES OF SHOULDER AND UPPER ARM. patient inclines his head towards the injured side, and, while standing, the forearm is supported by the hand of the opposite side. The acromion process stands out prominently, the roundness of the shoulder giving place to a flattening or depression immediately below it, so that a straight-edge applied to the outer aspect of the limb touches both the acromion and the external condyle. The vertical circumference of the axilla is markedly increased. The head of the bone can be felt in its new position, and the axis of the humerus is correspondingly altered, the elbow being carried from the side—forward or backward accord- ing to the position of the head. The empty glenoid may sometimes be pal- pated from the axilla. In most cases, although not in all, the patient is unable at one and the same time to bring his elbow to the side and to place the hand upon the oj^posite shoulder (Dugas’ symptom). Accurate measure- 116.-Kocher^ Method of reducing length tionofArra. of fiinb from acromion to external condyle are not easily made, and are rarely of any diagnostic value. The sub-coracoid dislocation (Fig. 115) is that most frequently met with. It usually results from hyper-abduction of the arm while the scapula is fixed, as in a fall on the inner side of the elbow when the arm is abducted from the side. The surgical neck of the humerus is then brought to bear upon the under aspect of the acromion, which forms a fulcrum, and the head of the bone is pressed against the inner and lower part of the capsule. In some cases muscular action produces this dislocation, the mechanism being the same as when it is due to indirect violence. It may also result from force applied directly to the upper end of the humerus.

531 DISLOCA.TIONS OF THE HIP. Dislocation on to the Dorsum Ilii.—This, the commonest form of dislocation of the hip, is usually the result of the patient falling from a height, or receiving a heavy weight on the back while stooping forward with the thigh flexed, slightly adducted, and rotated in. It is also said to have occurred from muscular action. The shaft of the femur acts as the long limb of a lever of which the neck is the short limb, while the femoral attachment of the A-ligament forms the ful- crum. The head, thus brought to bear upon the lower and back part of the capsule, tears it and leaves the socket, passing upwards and coming to rest on the back of the ilium, above and anterior to the tendon of the obturator internus (Fig. 182). The articular surface is directed back- ward, while the trochanter looks forward. Clinical Features.—The affected limb is flexed, ad- ducted, and rotated inward, so that the knee crosses the lower third of the opposite thigh, and the ball of the great toe lies on the dorsum of thesound foot (Fig. 183). There is shortening to the extent of from one and a half to two inches, the trochanter being displaced above Nelaton’s line, and lying nearer to the anterior superior iliac spine than on the normal side. The })atient is unable to move the limb or to bear weight upon it; abduction and external rotation are specially painful ; and traction fails to restore the limb to its proper length. On making these attempts a character- istic elastic resistance is felt. The head of the femur in its new position may some- times be felt through the fibres of the gluteus maximus, but swelling of the soft parts often obscures this .sign. The normal depression behind the great trochanter is lost, the gluteal fold Fro. 182.—Dislocation on to Dorsum Ilii. Note relation of neck of femur to tendons of oliturator internu.s and gemelli.

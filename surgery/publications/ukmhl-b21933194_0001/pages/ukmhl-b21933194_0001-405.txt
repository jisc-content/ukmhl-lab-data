367 SEBACEOUS CYSTS. Belonging to this group also is a form of congenital elephan- tiasis resulting from the circular constriction of a limb in ntero by amniotic bands. Elephantiasift occurring ajmrt from lymphatic or venom ohstruction is illustrated by elephantiasis nervorum, in which there is an overgrowth of the skin and cellular tissue of au entire extremity in association with neuro-fibromatosis of the cutaneous nerves ; and by elephantiasis Grcecorum—a form of leprosy in which the skin of the face becomes the seat of tumour-like masses consisting of lejrrous nodules. It is also illustrated by elephantiasis involving the scrotum as a result of the prolonged irritation of the urine in cases in which the penis JUu. 81.—Multiple Sebaceous CyMs or Weiis^ the larger ones are of many years’ duration. has been amputated and the urine has infiltrated the scrotal tissues. Sebaceous Cysts.—Atheromatous cysts or wens are retention cysts formed in relation to the sebaceous glands and hair follicles. They are commonly met with in adults, on the scalp (Eig. 81), face, neck, back, and external genitals. Sometimes they are multiple, and they may be met with in several members of the same family. They are smooth, rounded or discoid cysts, varying in size from a split-pea to a tangerine orange. In consistence they are firm and elastic, or fluctuating, and are incorporated with the overlying skin, but movable on the deeper structures. The orifice of the partially blocked sebaceous follicle may be visible (except on the scalp), and some of the contents of the cyst can be squeezed through the opening. The wall of the cyst is composed of a connective-tissue capsule lined by stratified

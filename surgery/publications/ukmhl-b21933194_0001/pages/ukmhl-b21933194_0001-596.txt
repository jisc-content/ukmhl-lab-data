558 INJURIES IN REGION OF KNEE AND LEG. necessary to lengthen tlie quadriceps muscle by making a number of V-shaped incisions through its substance, before the frag- ments can be approximated. When operative treatment is contra-indicated, the patient should be fitted with a firm apparatus Avhich Avill limit flexion of the knee and sup})ort the fragments. Dislocations of the patella are rare. They re-sult from exaggerated muscular movements when the limb is in the fully extended position, or from a blow on one or other edge of the bone. Laxity of the ligaments and knock-knee are pre- disi)osing factors. They are sometimes associated with fracture of the edge of the trochlear surface, which renders retention in position difficult. The outimrcl is the most common variety—the inward being Fig. 201.—Vertic.al Dislocation of Patella. rare. Either may be complete or incomplete. Sometimes the bone is rotated so that its edge rests on the front of the femur —vertical dislocation (Fig. 201); and in a few cases it has been completely turned round, so that the articular surface is directed forwards. Clinical Features.—The joint is fixed, usually in a position of slight flexion, and the displaced patella can readily be palpated. The deformity is a very striking one, and at first sight suggests a much more serious injury. Although easily reduced, the di.slocation is liable to recur. To effect reduction, the quadriceps must be thoroughly relaxed by extending the leg upon the thigh and flexing the thigh upon the pelvis. If the patella be now tilted by making firm pressure on that edge which lies furthe.st from the middle of the joint, and at the same time pushed towards the middle line, it usually slips into position without difficulty. The limb is jdaced on a posterior splint, and firm elastic pressure made on the joint to prevent or diminish effusion. Massage and movement are carried out from the first.

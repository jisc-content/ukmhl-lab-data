INJURIES OF WRIST AND HAND. 504 Fig. 154.—Treatiueutof Fractureof Metacarpals by Pad in the Palm and “ Closed-fist ” Bandage. the wliaft, the proximal end of the distal fragment projecting towards the dorsum of the hand. Apart from this there is little deformity, as the adjacent metacarjials act as natural splints and tend to retain the fragments in position. A sudden sharp pain may be elicited at the seat of fracture on making pressure in the long axis of the finger; and unnatural mobility and crepitus may usually be de- tected . These fractures are readily recognised by the X-rays. Firm union usually results in three weeks. Treatment.—When the fracture is transverse, and especially when it implicates the middle or ring fingers, the most convenient method of treatment is to make the patient grasp a firm pad, such as a roller bandage covered \yith a layer of wool, and to fix the closed fist by a figure-of-eight bandage (Fig. 154). In this way the adjoining metacarpals are utilised as lateral splints. To prevent the extensor tendon forming attachments to the broken bone, active and passive movements must be carried out daily, and the bandage may be removed at the end of a fortnight. In oblique frac- tures with a tendency to overriding of the fragments, especially in the case of the index and little fingers, it is some- times necessary to apply extension to the distal segment of the digit, by means of adhesive plaster, to which elastic tubing is attached and fixed to the end of a rectangular splint reaching well beyond the finger-tips (Fig. 155) (Chiene). This should be worn for a week or ten days, passive movement being carried out daily after the first week.

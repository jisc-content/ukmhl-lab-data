Boots should be made from a plaster cast of the foot, high and narrow at the instep so as to compress the bases of the metatarsals, with thick soles and the inner edge of the heel slightly raised. When the head of one of the metatarsals is displaced, it should be removed through a dorsal incision running parallel with the tendon of the long extensor. Hallux Valgus and Bunion.— Hallux vahjm is that deformity in which the great toe deviates towards the middle line of the foot and comes to lie on the to]) of, or beneath, the second toe (Big. 301). The head of the first metatarsal projects on the inner border of the foot (Fig. 302u), and, as a result of the pressure of the boot, an adventitious bursa is formed, which, when thickened by chronic in- flammation, constitutes a prominent swelling or hunion. It is a very common afiection in civi- lised, and especially in urban communities, and it reaches its acme of de- velopment in adult women. It may occur on one or on both sides, and it may be associated with flat-foot. The deformity is of very slow develoi)nient, and is usually attributed to the wearing of improperly made boots. The boot which favours the occur- rence of hallux valgus is one which is too short and which has pointed toes, with the a])ex in the middle line of the foot instead of being in line with the great toe. The pressure of the boot displaces the Fig. 302.—Hallux Valgus. «, Projecting lieail of tirst metatarsal. h, Tendon of extensor of great toe, di.splaced outwards.

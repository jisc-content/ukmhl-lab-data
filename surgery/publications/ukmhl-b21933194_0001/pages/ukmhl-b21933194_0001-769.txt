PARALYTIC DEFORMITIES. 731 recurvatuni. The treatment for the flail-joint is the application of a rigid apparatus or the operation of arthrodesis. When the (piadriceps is alone paralysed, the patient is obliged to maintain the joint in the position of extreme extension because he finds that the least degree of flexion results in the lind) giving way under him. In course of time the posterior ligament becomes sti'etched, and the joint becomes hyper-extended, ac- quiring the attitude of genu reeuwatum. The treatment consists in wearing an apjjaratus which ensures rigidity of the joint, or in transplant- ing the sartorius, tensor fascim femoris and portions of the hamstrings into the aponeurosis of the quad- riceps extensor, so as to comjiensate for the loss of power in this muscle. In extreme cases it may be better to perform arthro- desis. When the quadriceps is overcome liy a spastic con- traction of the hamstrings, and the knee is rigidly fixed in the flexed position, it is usually necessary to carry out division or even resection of the hamstrings Limbs in a boy set. 15, showing contrac- ture deformities.

In some cases it may be necessary to transplant portions of the hamstrings into the ([uadriceps. If there is a combination of flexion and genu valgum as shown in Fig. 284, the knee-joint should be excised and ankylosed in the straight position. Contracture and Ankylosis at the Knee.—In addition to the different paralytic forms above described, contracture may result from hysteria, from ulceration and suppuration in the popliteal space, and from disease—osteomyelitis—in one of the

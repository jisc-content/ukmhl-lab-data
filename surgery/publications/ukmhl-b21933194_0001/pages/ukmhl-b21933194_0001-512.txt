474 INJUEIES OF ELBOW AND FOREARM. backward dislocation of the elbow. The lower end of the upper fragment lies in front of the elbow. Clinical Features.—The elbow is flexed at an angle of 120° or 130°, and the forearm, held semi-pronated, is supported by the other hand. Around the seat of fracture great swelling rapidly ensues. The olecranon projects behind, but the mutual relations of the bony points of the elbow are unaltered. The lower end of the upper fragment may be felt in front above the level of the joint, as a rough and sharp projection, and this sometimes pierces the soft parts and renders the fracture com- pound. The joint movements are normal, but unnatural mobil- ity may be detected above the level of the joint. Crepitus and localised tenderness may be elicited. The disjflacement is readily reduced by manipulation, but is u.sually reproduced when the support is withdrawn. The upper arm is shortened to the extent of about half an inch. In rare cases the obliquity of the fracture is downward and backward, and the lower frag- ment is displaced forward. The inter-condylar fracture is a combination of the supra- condylar with a vertical split running through the articular surface, and so implicating the joint (Fig. 127). The condyles are thus separated from one another, as well as from the shaft, by a T- or Y-shaped cleft. As such fractures usually result from severe forms of direct violence, they are often comminuted and compound. In addition to the signs of supra-condylar fracture, the cavity of the joint is filled with blood. The condyles may be felt to move upon one another, and coarse crepitus, which has been likened to the feeling of a bag of beans, may be elicited if the fragments are comminuted. Separation of the lower epiphysis (Figs. 128 and 129) of the humerus is a comparatively frequent injury in children of Fig. 127. — Inter-condylar Fracture of Lower Bud of Humerus, from a crush between buflers, in a man 8et. 19.

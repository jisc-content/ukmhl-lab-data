618 DISEASES OF BONE. Neuropathic Formsof Osteomalacia.—In certain chronic diseases of the brain and cord, changes in the skeleton of the nature of osteomalacia may be met with. It is at present unknown why in certain cases the bones may lose their lime salts and bend, while in others they be- come porous and brittle. The senile form of osteo- malacia also is appar- ently of nerve origin. Osteomalacia associ- ated with New Growths in the Skeleton.—Reck- linghausen and others have described cases in which the marrow is transformed into a white fibrous tissue which may be the seat of haemor- rhages and cysts along with the development of giant-celled tumours or myelomata scattered throughout the skele- ton. This condition is usually associated with multiple fractures. There is also a form of osteomalacia associated with secondary cancer when this is widely diffused throughout the skeleton.

In the early stages, the marrow is transformed into a vascular connective tissue ; its bone-eating functions are exaggerated, and the frame- work of the bone becomes rarefied, so that it bends under pressure as in osteomalacia. In course of time, however, new bone is formed in great abundance both by the jreriosteum and by the marrow ; it is at first devoid of lime salts, but later

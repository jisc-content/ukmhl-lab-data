665 ARTHRITIS DEFORMANS. may be considerable disapi)earance of bone and consequent alteration in shape and size—a change which is well illustrated Fig. 248.—Arthritis Deformans of Knee, .showing ehurnation and grooving of articnlar surfaces. (Anatomical Museum, University of Edinburgh.) in the progressive enlargement of the acetabulum which takes place in certain cases of arthritis deformans of the liip. On the other hand, when the bone is condensed and sclerosed, it becomes smooth and polished as a result of the movements of the joint. When this change is very pronounced the appearance may be like that of ivory or porcelain and is described as ehurnation of the articular surfaces. In hinge joints, such as the knee or elbow, the eburnated articular surfaces may present a series of parallel grooves corre- ■sponding to the lines of movement (Fig. 248). Although the joint may become locked by the amount of new bone formed around the articular margins, fibrous or bony ankylosis scarcely ever occurs. In some cases the synovial membrane merely undergoes a degenerative alteration into cicatricial tissue with a marked tendency to contraction—arthritis sicca. In other cases it actively participates in the proliferative changes, becoming more vascular and thickened; and, as the result of hypertrophy of its fringes and enlargement and subdivision of its villi, becomes thickly set with elongated or club-shaped processes Fig. 249.—Hypertrophied Fringes of Synoviai Membrane in Arthritis Deformans of Knee.

SUPPURATION. 60 septic matter at the root of the nail (Fig. 13, b). A small focus of suppuration forms under the nail, with swelling and redness of the nail fold, causes intense pain and discomfort, which interfere with sleep, and produces a constitutional reaction out of all proportion to the local lesion. To allow the pus to escape, it is necessary, under local anaesthesia, to cut away the nail fold as well as the portion of nail in the affected area, or, it may be, to remove the nail entirely. If only a small opening is made in the nail it is apt to be blocked by granulations. Subcutaneous Whitlow.—In this variety the disease manifests itself as a cellulitis of the pulp of the finger (Fig. 13, c), which Fig. 13.—Diagram of various forms of Whitlow. a = Purulent blister. Z) = Suppuration at nail fold. c=Sul)cutaneous wliitlow. (? = Whitlow in sheath of flexor tendon (e). sometimes spreads towards the palm of the hand. The finger becomes red, swollen, and tense, there is severe pain, which is usually worst at night and prevents sleep, and the part is extremely tender on pressure. When the palm is invaded, the swelling may be most marked on the back of the hand, the dense integument of the palm preventing the swelling from appearing on the front, until the pus is nearing the surface. The pus which forms may be under such tension that fiuctua,tion cannot be detected. The patient is usually able to flex the finger to a certain extent without increasing the pain—a j^oint which indicates that the tendon sheaths have not been invaded. The suppurative process may, however, sjiread to the tendon sheaths, or even to the bone. Sometimes the excessive tension and virulent toxins induce actual gangrene of the distal part, or

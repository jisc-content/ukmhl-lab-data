Burns of Fourth Degree—Total Destruction of the True Skin.—These follow the prolonged application of any form of intense heat. Large, black, dry eschars are formed, surrounded by a zone of intense congestion (Fig. 54). Pain is less severe, and is experienced in the parts which have been burned to a less degree.

The patient was burned by falling into the fire while intoxicated. Recovery. wide destruction of the surrounding skin. The amount of granulation tissue necessary to fill the gap is therefore great; and as the epithelial covering can only be derived from the margins—the skin glands being completely destroyed—the healing process is slow. The resulting scars are irregular, deep and puckered, and show a great tendency to contract. Keloid frequently develops in such cicatrices. When situated in the region of the face, neck, or flexures of joints, much deformity and impairment of function may result (Figs. 55, 56). In burns of the fifth degree the lesion extends through the subcutaneous tissue and involves the muscles; while in those of the sixth degree it passes still more deeply and implicates the

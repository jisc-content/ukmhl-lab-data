CAUSES OF ULCERS. 77 ference with the nerve-supply of the superficial tissues pre- disposes to ulceration. For example, trophic ulcers are liable to occur in injuries or diseases of the spinal cord, in cerebral paralysis, in limbs weakened by infantile paralysis, in ascend- ing or peripheral neuritis, or after injuries of nerve-trunks (Fig. 17). It is believed by some that the common chronic ulcer of the leg is dependent upon altered trophic innervation, as well as upon changes in the venous circulation. The acute hed-sore (p. 110) is a rapidly-progressing form of ulceration, often amounting to gangrene, of portions of skin Fig. 18.â€”Perforating Ulcer on the Foot of a woman let. 62, who suffered from Diabetes. exposed to pressure when their trophic nerve-supply has been interfered with. The ordinary joressiwe bed-sore (p. 110), although not neces- sarily associated with defective nerve-supply, may be so. The perforating ulcer of the foot is a peculiar type of sore which occurs in association with the different forms of peripheral neuritis, and with various lesions of the brain and spinal cord, such as general paralysis, locomotor ataxia, or syringo-myelia. It also occurs in patients suffering from glycosuria (Fig. 18). Perforating ulcer is met with most frequently under the head of the metatarsal bone of the great toe. A callosity forms and

There is rarely in the foot, when one or other of the main nerve-trunks has been divided or compressed, the joints become swollen and painful, and may afterwards be- come stiff and deformed. Bony ankylosis has been observed in exceptional cases. In Affections of the Spinal (lord. — In myelitis, progressive muscular atrophy, infantile par- alysis, insular sclerosis, and in traumatic lesions, joint affections are very rare, but they are not un- common in locomotor ataxia and in syringomyelia. The occurrence of joint lesions in locomotor ataxia (tabes dor- salis) was first described by Char- cot in 1868 — hence the term “ Charcot’s disease ” applied to them. Although they usually develop in the ataxic stage, one or more years after the initial spinal symptoms, they may ap- jiear before there is any other evidence of tabes. The onset is frequently determined by some injury to the joint. The joints of the lower extremity are most commonly affected, and the dis- ease is bilateral in. a consider- able proportion of cases—both knees or both hips, for instance, being implicated (Eig. 268). The first symptom of arthro- pathy is usually a swelling of the joint and its vicinity, often no redness or heat and no pain

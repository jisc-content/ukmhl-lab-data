728 THE DEFORMITIES OF THE EXTREMITIES. deformities of the skeleton due to the rickets of childhood, coxa vara is very rare. It is most often associated with pronounced eversion of both lower extremities (Fig. 281), without the capacity for abduction being necessarily restricted, and with but little impairment of function. If the child receives the appropriate treatment for rickets, and is put up in a double long splint with the limbs inverted and abducted, the deformity is usually recovered from. In arthritis deformans of the hip-joint, it is not uncommon to have considerable depression of the head of the bone and diminution in the angle of its neck, with consequent re- striction of abduction. Some- times the upper end of the shaft is curved as shown in Figs. 267, 279. Injuries of the upper end of the femur may result in coxa vara—traumatic coxa vara (Royal Whitman). When sustained in early childhood, greenstick frac- ture of the neck of the femur and separation of its upper epiphysis may result in softening of the bone, so that it bends under the Aveight of the body. The deformity, which is the same as that of the adolescent form, may, however, not show itself until puberty. The treat- ment is carried out on the lines already indicated.

Congenital Dislocation at the knee-joint results from ab- normal attitude of the foetus in utero and is extremely rare; it is usually incomplete, and its direction varies. The displace.- ment may be permanent, or may only occur from accidental movements of the limb. In some cases it can be produced at Avill by the patient or the surgeon. Congenital absence of the patella may exist along with

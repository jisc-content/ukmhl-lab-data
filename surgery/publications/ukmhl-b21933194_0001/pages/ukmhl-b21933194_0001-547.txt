509 DISLOCATIONS OF THE THUMB. reducing this variety of dislocation have been offered, but the consensus of opinion now seems to be that it is due to the interposition of the glenoid ligament and the sesamoid bones between the phalanx and the metacarpal, and that this is most frequently the result of ill-advised efforts at reduction. In some cases the tension of the long flexor tendon may be a factor in [)reventing reduction, but the “ button-holing ” by the short flexor is probably of no importance. Reduction is to be effected by flexing and adducting the Fig. 162.—To illustrate Method of dividing the Glenoid Ligament by Subcutaneous Operation. metacarpal while the phalanx is hyper-extended and pushed down towards the joint and levered over the head of the meta- carpal. When this manipidation fails, the glenoid ligament should be divided longitudinally through a puncture made with a tenotomy knife on the dor.sal aspect of the joint, so as to se^jarate the sesamoid bones and permit the passage of the head between them (Fig. 162). An open operation is seldom necessary. Dislocation forvmrd is rare. It results from forced flexion of the thumb with abduction, tearing the posterior and internal

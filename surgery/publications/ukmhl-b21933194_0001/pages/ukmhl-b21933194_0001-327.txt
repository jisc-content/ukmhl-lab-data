TRAUMATIC ANEURYSM. 299 tendency to become limited. These have already been described under ruptured artery. The aneurysm may form soon after the injury is inflicted, and before the wound in the wall cicatrises. Blood slowly escapes into the surrounding tissues, gradually displacing and condensing them, until they form a distinct sac enclosing the effused blood. Towards the periphery the blood coagulates, and, being under considerable pressure, the clot becomes condensed. Less frequently a traumatic aneurysm forms some consider- able time after the injury, from gradual stretching of the fibrous cicatrix by which the wound in< the wall of the artery has been closed. The gradual stretching of this cicatrix results in condensation of the surrounding structures which form the sac, on the inner aspect of which laminated clot is deposited. Fig. 66.—Traumatic Aneurysm of Brachial Artery, in girl a;t. 16, caused by stab with pen-knife. A traumatic aneurysm is almost always sacculated, and, so long as it remains circumscribed, has the same characters as a pathological sacculated aneurysm, with the addition that there may be external evidence of a wound. A ti'aumatic aneurysm is very liable to rupture and become diffuse—a change which may result in bringing about a cure. The treatment is governed by the same principles as ajiply to the pathological varieties. The walls of the artery being healthy, operative measures dealing with the sac and its feeding arteries are to be preferred. Arterio-Venous Aneurysm. An abnormal communication between an artery and a vein constitutes an arterio-venous aneurysm. Two varieties are recognised—one in which the communication is direct [aneurysmal varix) (Fig. 67); the other in which the vein communicates with the artery through the medium of an aneurysmal sac (varicose aneurysm) (Fig. 68). Either variety may result from pathological causes, but in the vast majority of cases they are traumatic in origin, being

The prognosis in burns depends on (1) the superficial extent, and, to a much less degree, the depth of the injury. When more than one-third of the entire surface of the body is involved, even in a mild degree, death usually follows. (2) The situation of the burn is important. Burns over the serous cavities— abdomen, thorax, or skull — are, other things being equal, much more dangerous than burns of the limbs. The risk of oedema glottidis in burns about the neck and mouth has been already referred to.

Treatment.—-The geyieral treatment consists in combating the shock (p. 244). When pain is severe, morphin must be injected. Local Treatment.—This must be carried out on the most rigid antiseptic lines, a general anaesthetic being administered, if necessary, to ensure the purification being carried out thoroughly.

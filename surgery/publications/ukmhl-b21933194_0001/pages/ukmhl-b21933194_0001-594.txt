556 INJURIES IN REGION OF KNEE AND LEG. this has been accoiiiplished, the attempt is made to approximate the fragments, by fixing a large horseshoe-shaped piece of adhesive plaster to the front of the thigh, embracing the upper fragment. Extension is made upon this by means of rubber tubing, which is fixed to the foot-piece of the splint (Fig. 199). The bandage which binds the limb to the splint should make upward pressure on the lower fragment, or this may be done by a special piece of adhesive plaster with elastic tubing pulling in an upward direction. The retentive apparatus is kept on for about three weeks, and a rigid, but easily removable, apparatus is thereafter applied, and the patient allowed up on crutches, the limb being massaged and exercised daily to improve the tone of the muscles. Fig. 199.—Treatment of Fracture of Patella liy means of Inclined Plane and Elastic Extension. Operative, Treatment.—This is specially indicated in young subjects who lead an active life, and in labouring men, particu- larly those who follow dangerous employments necessitating great stability of the knees. A vertical or semilunar incision is made through the skin and fascia, and the fragments exposed. All blood-clot is removed from the joint, the periosteum is reflected from between the fragments, and any clot or loose portions of , bone lying between them removed. The fragments are then approximated by suturing the bone directly with silver wire, which is passed through the fragments transversely (G. Hamilton), in such a way as to avoid piercing the articular cartilage and encroach- ing on the cavity of the joint. When the fracture is commin- uted, or the bone liable to be split in the drilling process, the suture may be applied circumferentially round the patella, pass-

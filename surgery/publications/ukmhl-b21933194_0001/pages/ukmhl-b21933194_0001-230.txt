202 TUMOURS. Adenomata may be single or multiple, and they vary in size from a pea to an adult human head. The tumour is seldom composed entirely of gland tissue; it usually contains a considerable proportion of fibrous tissue, and is called a fibro- adenoma. When it contains myxomatous tissue it is called a myxo-adenoma, and when the gland spaces of the tumour become distended with accumulated secretion, a cystic adenoma, Fig. 47.â€”Papilloma of the Vulva. the best examples of which are met with in the mamma and ovary. A characteristic feature of the cystic variety is the tendency the tumour tissue exhibits to project into the interior of the cysts, constituting what are known as intracystic growths. They are essentially innocent, and when removed by opera- tion, show no tendency to recur. At the same time, transition forms between adenoma and carcinoma are met with, especially in the intestine, and these should be treated on the same lines as cancer.

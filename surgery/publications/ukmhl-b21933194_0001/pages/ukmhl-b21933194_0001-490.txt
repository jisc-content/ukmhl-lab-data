The shoulder is more frequently dislocated than all the other joints in the body taken together. This is explained by its exposed jjosition, the wide range of movement of which it is capable, the length of the lever afforded by the humerus, and the anatomical con- struction of the joint— the large, round humeral head imperfectly fitting the small and shallow glenoid cavity, and the ligaments being comparatively lax and thin. The capsule of the joint is materially strengthened in its upper and back parts by the tendons of the supra- and infra- spinatus and teres minor muscles; while it is weakest below and in front, between the subscapularis and teres major tendons. It is here that it most frequently gives way and allows of displacement of the head of the bone. The violence is usually transmitted from the hand or elbow, less frequently from the outer aspect of the shoulder, the limb being at the moment abducted and the muscles relaxed and taken unawares. The head of the humerus, thus brought to bear on the weakest part of the capsule, ruptures it and passes out through the rent. Dis- location is readily produced in an uncon- scious patient, and sometimes occurs in con- ducting artificial respiration or in handling a patient suffering from opium poisoning. Varieties.—Several varieties of dislocation are recognised according to the position in which the head of the humerus finally rests (Fig. 114). The simplest and least complicated of these is the svih-glenoid variety, in which the head rests on the long head of the triceps where it arises from the Fig. 114.—Diagram of most common vari- eties of Dislocation of the Shoulder.

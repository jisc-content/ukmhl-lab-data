18 CONDITIONS INTERFERING WITH REPAIR. hence the term aureus. It is of high vitality and resists more prolonged exposure to high temperatures than most non-sporing bacteria. It is capable of lying latent in the tissues for long periods, and of again becoming active and causing a fresh out- break of suppuration, for example in the marrow of long bones. This organism is widely distributed : it is found on the skin, in the mouth, and in other situations in the body, and it occurs in all situations where dust is present.

The staphylococcus albus is much less common than the aureus, but has the same properties and characters, save that its growth on artificial media assumes a white colour. It is the common cause of stitch abscesses, the skin being its normal habitat. Streptococcus Pyogenes.—This organism also varies greatly in its virulence, but the conditions which determine the variations are as yet imperfectly understood. In some instances—for example, in erysipelas—it causes a sharp attack of acute sju’eading

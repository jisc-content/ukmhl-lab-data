482 INJURIES OF ELBOW AND FOREARM. may be felt through the skin, although it usually continues to move with the shaft in pronation and supination. Union generally takes place satisfactorily, but in some cases the fragments form new attachments resulting in impaired move- ment at the elbow. Fracture of the neck of the radius between the capsule and the tubercle is rare. These injuries are treated with the elbow in the flexed position, and massage and movement are carried out as already described. Dislocations of the Elbow. Dislocations of the elbow-joint may involve one or both bones of the forearm, and may be complete or incomplete. Dislocation of both bones backward is the most common of all dislocations of the elbow, and is the only dislocation in the body which is frequently met with in children. It usually results from a fall on the outstretched hand, causing hyper-extension of the joint with abduction—that is, lateral deviation towards the radial side; but it may follow a direct blow on the back of the humerus, a fall on the elbow, or a twist of the forearm. Morbid Anatomy. — The anterior and lateral ligaments of the elbow are torn, while the posterior and orbicular ligaments remain intact. The radius and ulna pass backward, „ .. .. the coronoid process coming to Elbow, in a boy st. 10, caused by a rest opposite the olecranon fossa fall off a wall, landing on the elbow, behind the humerus, and the head of the radius behind the external condyle. The condyles of the humerus bear their normal relations to one another. The olecranon process and triceps tendon form a marked prominence on the back of the elbow, the tip of the olecranon lying above and behind the

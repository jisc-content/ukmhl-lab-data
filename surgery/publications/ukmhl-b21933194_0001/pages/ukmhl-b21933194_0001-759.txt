CONGENITAL DISLOCATION OF THE HIP. 721 muscles, especially of the gluteus meclius and luiuiimis. These muscles which uonaally maintain the pelvis horizontal are no longer able to do so, and every time the child puts the dis- located limb to the ground and lifts the other one, the trunk suddenly lurches to the sound side. The shortening, which increases 'with age, and may finally amount to several inches, is partly compensated for while standing by resting the affected Fig. 275.—Congenital Dis- location of Right Hip ill a gill set, 9. The trochanter on the right side is indi- cated by a mark.

The muscles of the buttock and thigh are smaller, the trochanter is prominent and at a higher level, and the gluteal fold is shorter and deeper (Fig. 275). The trochanter is well above Nelaton’s line. The head of the femur is absent from its normal situation, and may be felt just below or immediately to the outer side of the anterior superior spine. The pelvis is inclined forwards, and this is associated with flexion at the hip and well- VOD. 1—46

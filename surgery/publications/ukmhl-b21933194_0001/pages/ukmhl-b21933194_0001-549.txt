Fracture of the Pelvis. For descriptive as well as for practical purjioses it is useful to divide fractures of the pelvis into those which involve the integrity of the pelvic girdle as a whole, and those confined to individual bones. In all, the prognosis depends upon the severity of the visceral lesions which so frequently complicate these injuries, rather than upon the fractures themselves. Fractures implicating the pelvic girdle as a whole usually result from severe crushing forms of violence, such as the fall of a mass of coal or a pile of timber, or the passage of a heavy wheel over the pelvis. The force may act in the transverse axis of the pelvis, or in its antero-posterior axis. The pelvic viscera may be lacerated by the tearing asunder of the bones, or perforated by sharp fragments. As a rule, more than one part of the pelvis is broken, the situation of the lesions and the clinical features varying in different cases. Separation of the pubic symphysis may result from violence inflicted on the fork, as in coming down forcibly on the pommel of a saddle; from forcible abduction of the thighs; or it may happen during child-birth. In some cases there is no permanent displacement, the only evidence of the injury being localised pain in the region of the symphysis elicited on making pressure over any part of the pelvis. In others the two pubic bones overlap

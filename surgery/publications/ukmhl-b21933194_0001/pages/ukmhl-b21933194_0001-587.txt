INJURIES OF SEMILUNAR CARTILAGES. 519 movement which combines flexion of the knee with internal rotation of the femur upon the tibia, as, for examj)le, in rising (juickly from a squatting position, or turning rapidly and pushing off with the foot, in the course of some game such as football or tennis. It may occrrr also from accidentally kicking a loose stone or slipping off the kerbstone. What actually happens when the cartilage is displaced would appear to be, that the combined flexion and abduction of the knee opens up the inner side of the joint by se[>arating the internal condyle from the inner tuberosity of the tibia, and that the internal cartilage in its movement backward during flexion slips under the condyle and is caught between it and the Fui. 195.—Displacement of Right Internal Seniilnuar Cartilage towanhs the Centre of the Joint. tibia. It may even slip past the condyle and into the inter- condyloid notch and come to lie against the crucial ligaments. The mechanism by which this lesion is produced doubtless explains the greater frequency with which the left knee is affected, as most sudden movements are made from right to left, thus throwing the strain upon the left knee. Clinical Features.—When the patient is seen immediately after the accident has happened, it will msually be found that while making some sudden movement, he was seized with an intense sickening pain in the knee, accompanied, it may be, by a sensation of something giving way with a distinct crack, and followed by locking of the joint. The patient u.sually falls and may be unable to rise again. The knee is found to be fixed in a slightly flexed position; and while the surgeon may be able

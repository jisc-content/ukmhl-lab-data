MYELOMA. 625 entire bone, such as the scapula or lower jaw, is involved, it is better to excise the bone, or at least the i>art of it which bears the tumour. In the case of central tumours the shell of bone is to be removed over an area sufficient to allow of the enucleation of the tumour, or the affected portion of bone is resected. Should there be evidence of malig- nancy, early amputation is called for. The chondromata which undergo ossification con- currently with the skele- ton, have been described with the osteomata. Fibroma is met with chiefly as a perio.steal growth in relation to the mouth and pharynx, the simple epulis of the al- veolar margin and the naso-pharyngeal polypus being the most common examples. They will be described with the special regions in which they occur. Myxoma, lipoma, and angioma of bone are all very rare. Myeloma. —The myeloma or myeloid tumour, which is some- times classified with the sarcomata, contains as its chief elements large giant cells, like those normally present in the marrow. These tumours usuallypresent abrowuish- red or chocolate colour, and being very vascular are liable to Inemoi’- rhages, to pigmentation, and to the formation of blood cysts. Sometimes the arterial vessels are so dilated as to impart to the tumour an aneurysmal pulsation and bruit. The enlargement or “ expansion ” of the bone may result in the cortex being represented by a thin shell of bone, which may crackle on pressure—egg-shell crackling. The tissue of the tumour ma}' licpiefy so as to form a single or a nmltilocular cyst, and it is in this way that the majority of cysts of bone originate. VOL. I—40 Fig. 237.—Chondroma of Femur. 'J'he femoral ves.sels pass through the .sukstance of the tumour, and the sciatic nerve is adherent to its surface.

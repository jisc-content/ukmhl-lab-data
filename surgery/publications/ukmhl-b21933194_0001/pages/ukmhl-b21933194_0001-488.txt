The sternal end of the clavicle may be dislocated forwards, backwards, or upwards. Forward dislocation is the most common, the end of the clavicle lies on the front of the sternum, somewhat below the level of the sterno-clavicular joint, and its articular surface can be distinctly palpated (Pig. 112). The interarticular car- tilage sometimes remains at- tached to one bone, sometimes to the other, and the rhomboid ligament is usually intact. In the backward dislocation end of the clavicle lies behind the manubrium sterni and the muscles attached to it; there is a marked hollow in the position of the joint, and the facet on the sternum can be felt. In a compara- tively small number of cases the bone exerts pressure upon the trachea and oesophagus, produc- ing difficulty in breathing and swal- lowing. It has also been known to press upon the subclavian Fig. 112.—Forward Dislocation of Sternal Eud artery and on other of Eight Clavicle. important structures at the root of the neck. In rare cases the rhomboid ligament is torn, and the end of the clavicle passes upwards, and rests in the episternal notch behind the sterno-mastoid muscle. Dislocation of both ends of the clavicle has occasionally occurred from a severe crush. The ultimate results have been satisfactory, as one or other end has always united in normal position, and the function of the arm has thus been maintained. Clinical Features.—In all varieties the clinical features are so well marked that the diagnosis is unmistakable. The head inclines towards the affected side, and the tip of the shoulder

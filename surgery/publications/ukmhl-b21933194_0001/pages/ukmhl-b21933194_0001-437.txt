In front of the patella and its ligament there is a bursa Fig. 91.—Hydrops of Prepatellar Bursa in a housemaid. which may have one, two, or three compartments, usually communicating with one another. It is the seat of the affection known as housemaid’s knee (Fig. 91)—which has already been described (p. 396). The bursa between the ligamentum patellae and the tibia is very rarely the seat of independent disease. When it is, there is pain and tenderness referred to the liga- ment, the patient is unable to extend the limb completely, the tubercle of the tibia is apparently enlarged, and there is a fluctuating swelling on either side of the ligament, most marked in the extended position of the limb. Of the numerous bursse in the popliteal space, that between the semi- membranosus and the inner head of the gastrocnemius is most frequently the seat of disease, which is usually of the nature of a simple hydrops, forming a fluctuating egg- or sausage- shaped swelling at the inner side of the popliteal space (Fig. 92). It is flaccid in the flexed, and tense in the extended position of the limb. As a rule it causes little inconvenience and may be left alone. Other- wise it should be dissected out, and if, as is frequently the case, there is a communication with the knee-joint, this should be closed with sutures. An adventitious bursa may form over , the Fig. 92.—Enlarged Senii- Membranosiis Bursa.

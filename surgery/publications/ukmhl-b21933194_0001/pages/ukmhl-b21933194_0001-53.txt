25 TEMPERATURE. saprteinia, the teiiiiierature chart is characterised by diurnal variations, ranging from 97° F. in the morning to 102° or 103° F. in the evening. The rise usually begins in the afternoon, and the fall takes place suddenly in the early morning, and is accompanied by profuse sweating The same type of temperature curve is met with in cases of surgical tuberculosis, where there is, in all probability, a mixed infection. In these cases the higliest temperature may be recorded in the afternoon. In such conditions as erysipelas (p. 113), where a constant supjdy of toxins is poured into the system, the temperature remains elevated so long as the disease progresses, but falls more or less rapidly whenever its progress is arrested (Fig. 7). A relapse is at once indicated by a second rise of temperature. In septicaimia (p. 68), organisms as well as toxins enter the circula- tion, and the temperature charts of this disease vary so widely that it is difficult to determine a type. So long as the disease progresses, the temperature curve is practically the same as that of saprsemia or of

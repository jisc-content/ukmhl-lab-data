FRACTURES OF UPPER END OF HUMERUS. 467 Traumatic separation is met Avith chiefly between the fifth and fifteenth years, and is most common in boys. It usually results from forcible traction of the arm upwards and outwards, as in lifting a child by the upper arm, or from direct viol- ence, but may be caused by a fall on the outer side of the elbow. The epiphysis, especially in young children, may be separated without being displaced, or the displacement may be incomplete. When the epiphysis is completely separated from the shaft, the clinical features closely resemble those of fracture of the surgical neck, and the diagnosis is made by a consideration of the age of the patient, and the muffled character of the crei)itus, when it can be elicited. The upper end of the diaphysis forms a projecting edge which may be felt nearer the coracoid process than in frac- ture of the surgical neck. The diagnosis can usually be estab- lished by the use of the X-rays. Dislocation is rare at the when separation of the epiphysis occurs. Reduction is often difficult on account of the periosteum and other soft tissues get- ting between the fragments, and on account of the small size of the upper fragment. Union almost invariably results, but the growth of the limb may be seriously interfered with (Fig. 125), and its shape is sometimes much altered, especially when the injury occurs at an early age and its nature is overlooked. Treatment.—This injury is treated on the same general lines as fracture of the surgical neck, but the details are more difficult to carry out, on account of the shortness of the upper fragment, the extensive laceration of soft parts, and the restlessness and Fig. 123.—Wedge-sliaped Splint of Poroplastic for treatmentof Fractures at Upper Fiiid of Humerus in abducted position.

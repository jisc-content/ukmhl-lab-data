This form is sometimes called Diipuyfrenh fracture. The force continuing to act, the lower end of the fibula is pressed outwards and breaks close above the malleolus. When the l)ones are widely separated in Dupuytren’s fracture the astragalus may be forced u]> between them. When the movement of abductiov [U’cdoniinates, the internal lateral liga- ment is usually ruptured, or the anterior edge or tip of the internal malleolus torn off. The inferior tibio-fibular liga- ment usually resists, and an oldicjue fracture of the fibula two to four inches from its lower end results.

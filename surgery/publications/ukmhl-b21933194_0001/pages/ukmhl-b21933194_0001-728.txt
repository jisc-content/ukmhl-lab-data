DISEASES OF INDIVIDUAL JOINTS. 690 Swelling is best detected on the anterior aspect of the joint; when present it may fill up the fold of the groin and project forward the femoral vessels. It is doughy and elastic like the white swelling of other joints, but may at any time liquefy and form a cold abscess. Swelling about the trochanter and neck of the bone may be estimated by measuring the antero-posterior diameter with calipers, and comparing with the sound side. The absence of swelling does not exclude the existence of hiji disease, as the lesions may be confined to the interior of the bone. Swelling on the pelvic aspect of the acetabulum may be discovered on rectal examination. Third Stage.—This probably corresponds with advanced caries of the articular surfaces, since pain is now a more pro- minent feature, and there are usually startings at night. The Fig. 262.—Disease of Left Hip—exaggeration of lordosis produced by extending the joint. attitude is one of adduction, inversion, increase of flexion, and apparent or real shortening of the limb (Fig. 263). The^e^ow is usually so pronounced that it can no longer be concealed by lordosis, so that when the patient is recumbent, although the spine is arched forwards, the limb is still flexed both at the hip and at the knee ; with the spine flat on the table the flexion of the thigh may amount to as much as a right angle. The adduction varies greatly in degree; when it is slight, as is most often the case, the toes of the affected limb rest on the dorsum of the sound foot, as in a traumatic dislocation on to the dorsum ilii. When moderate, it is compensated for by raising of the pelvis on the affected side, with apparent shorten- ing of the limb (Fig. 264), this being the result of an effort on the part of the patient to restore the normal parallelism of the limbs, the sound limb being abducted to the same extent as

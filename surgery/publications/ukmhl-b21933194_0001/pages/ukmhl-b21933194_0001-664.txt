626 DISEASES OF BONE. The myeloma is most often met with in the bones in the region of the knee of adolescents (Fig. 238); it grows slowly and without much pain, and may even become quiescent. It may be mistakeir for tuberculous disease, for a gumma, a Brodie’s abscess, or, if it pulsates, for popliteal aneurysm. Fig. 239.—The Femur of a boy at. 12, showing the Bony Shell of a large Cyst-like Cavity which com- municates with the interior of the bone. The original tumour was probably a sarcoma. Although these tumours some- times give rise to secondary growths presenting a similar giant-celled structure, they are, as a rule, innocent, and should be treated as such, either by shelling out the new growth, or by resecting the jJortion of bone in which it is lodged. Malignant tumours of bone.—Sarcomata and endothelio- mata are the commonest tumours of bone, and present wide variations in structure and in clinical features. Structurally, two main groups may be differentiated: (1) the soft, rapidly growing cellular tumours, and (2) those containing fully formed fibrous tissue, cartilage, or bone.

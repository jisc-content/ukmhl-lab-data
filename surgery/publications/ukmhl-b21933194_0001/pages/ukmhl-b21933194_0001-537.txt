SEPARATION OF LOWER EPIPHYSIS OF RADIUS. 499 styloid is displaced forward, upward, and to the radial side, and the ulnar styloid may be torn off. Crepitus can seldom be elicited. When the deformity is not well marked, this injury may be mistaken for forward dislocation of the wrist, for fracture of both bones low down, or for sprain of the joint. The treatment is carried out on the same lines as iii Colies’ fracture. Longitudinal fractures of the lower end of the radius opening into the joint usually result from the hand being crushed by a heavy weight or in machinery. They are often compound and com- minuted. Separation of the lower epi- physis of the radius is com- paratively common between the ages of seven and eighteen, especi- ally in boys, and is caused by the same forms of violence as produce Codes’ fracture. The epijjhysis, which is on the same level as that of the ulna (Fig. 152), lies above the level of the synovial membrane of the wrist-joint. Although the clinical ap- pearances in these two injuries bear a general resemblance to one another, separation of the epiphysis may usually be identified by the Fig.152. —Section of lower end of directly transverse line of the Radius and Ulna to show line of dorsal and palmar projections, the Epiphyses, folding of the skin observed in (After Poland.) the palmar depression, the absence of abduction of the hand, and the ease with which muffled crepitus can be elicited (E. H. Bennett). The deformity is readily reduced, and the fragments are easily retained in position. This injury is often complicated with fracture of the shaft or styloid process of the ulna, or with dislocation of the radio-ulnar joint, and it is not infrequently compound. Interference with the growth of the radius seldom occurs ; when it does it results in a valgus condition of the hand, calling for resection of the lower end of the ulna. The treatment is the same as for Colles’ fracture.

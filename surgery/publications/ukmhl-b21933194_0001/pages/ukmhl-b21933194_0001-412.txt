374 THE SKIN AND SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUE. early stage in the disease, although it has been delayed in some cases for several years. The secondary growths are deejjly pig- mented, being usually of a coal-black colour, and melanin pigment may be present in the urine. The treatment consists in early and free removal of the primary growth, and of the associated lymjjhatic glands—whether these are enlarged or not. In the great majority of cases, when seen by the surgeon the disease is so far advanced that operative treatment holds out but little prospect of saving life. Secondary Cancer of the Skin.—Cancer may spread to the skin from a subjacent growth by direct continuity or by way of the lymi^hatics. Both of these processes are well illustrated in cases of mammary cancer, and will be described along with diseases of the breast. Sarcomata of various types are m^t with in the skin. The most common is the alveolar sarcoma, which commences as a hard lump and steadily increases in size until the epidermis gives way and an ulcer is formed. A number of fresh tumours may spring up around the original growth. Sometimes the primary appearance is in the form of multiple nodules in the skin which tend to become confluent. Excision, un- less performed early, is of little avail. Fig. 85. — Melanotic Cancer of Sole of Foot.

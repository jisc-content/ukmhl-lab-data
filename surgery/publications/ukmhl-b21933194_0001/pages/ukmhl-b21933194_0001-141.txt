Erysipelas is an acute sjireading infiainraation of skin or mucous membrane due to tlie action of a streptococcus. The organism was at one time believed to be specific as regards this disease, and was called by Fehleisen the streptococcus erysipelatis, but it is now generally accepted that it is the ordinary strepto- coccus pyogenes “ of a certain degree of virulence,” although the conditions which so modify it that it causes erysipelas are as yet not fully understood. Infection invariably takes place through an abrasion of the surface, although this may be so slight that it escapes observation even when sought for. With our improved methods of wound treatment, erysipelas very rarely attacks an ojieration wound; when it does so it is usually in wounds about the face and mouth, where it is impossible to maintain asepsis. The streptococci are found most abundantly in the lymph spaces of the affected tissue, and in the serous blebs which sometimes form on the surface, but they seldom invade the blood-stream. Microscopically, four zones are to be recognised from with- out inwards in a patch of erysipelas. (1) Just beyond the reddened area is a zone in which active spread is taking place, all the lymphatic spaces being crowded with rapidly multiplying streptococci; (2) at the margin of the red area the lymph spaces are crowded with leucocytes, many of which have streptococci in their interior; (3) in a zone internal to this the inflammatory reaction is less marked, and all the free cocci have disappeared; and (4) towards the centre of the patch the tissues

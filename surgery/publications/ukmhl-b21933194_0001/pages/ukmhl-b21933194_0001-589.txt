INJURIES OF SEMIIATNAR CARTILAGES. 551 pads, bandages, or otlier forms of apparatus, so arranged as to prevent rotation and lateral movement at the knee. In the majority of cases, however, the best results are obtained by exposing the cartilage by an incision in its long axis, and excising it, in whole or in part, as may be necessary. The capsule is closed by a row of buried catgut sutures, and the wound stitched without drainage. The limb is fixed on a splint for about a fortnight, after which the patient is allowed to move it in bed. At the end of three weeks he is allowed up, wearing an elastic bandage. In the course of two or three months he may resume an active Fig. 196. — Longitiuliual Tear of Posterior End of Right tnteriial Semilunar Cartilage. life, and it is seldom found that the joint is in any way im- paired. Displacement of the external cartilage is comparatively rare. It is in every way comparable to displacement of the internal cartilage, and is treated on the same lines. Torn or Lacerated Cartilage.— In a large proportion of cases of displaced cartilage in which the condition assumes the recurrent type, it is found on opening the joint, that, in addition to being unduly mobile, the cartilage is torn or lacerated. The experience of different surgeons varies regarding the nature of the laceration. In our experience the most common form has been a longitudinal split, whereby a portion of the inner edge of the cartilage was separated from the rest and projected as a tag towards the cavity of the joint (Fig. 196). As a rule, it is the anterior end wliich is torn, less fre<|uently the posterior end. Sometimes the cartilage is split from end to end, the outer

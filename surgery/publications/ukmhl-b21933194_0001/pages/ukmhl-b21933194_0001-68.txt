40 CHAPTER IV. INFLAMMATION. Nature of inflammation from surgical point of view — Sequence of changes in inflammation — Clinical aspects of inflammation — General principles of treatment—Results of inflammation—Chronic inflammation. The infection of a wound by pathogenic bacteria is soon followed by a complex series of changes in the affected tissues which constitutes the process of inflammation. This process is to be looked upon as the reaction of the tissue elements to the irritation caused by the invading micro-organisms and their products. Certain tissue changes similar to, if not identical with, those of inflammation due to bacterial action result from mechanical or thermal injury of a part, or the application of purely chemical substances to the tissues; and the early stages in the process of ideal repair are characterised by changes of a like kind. Fi’om the clinical point of view, however, these processes are to be looked upon as the physiological effects of stimulation of the tissues acting reflexly through the nervous system, rather than as the pathological results of irritation. The local structural changes and the general constitutional effects of these conditions differ so widely from those of true inflammation of bacterial origin, that to attempt to include all in one category seems calculated to obscure the essential characters of each and to lead to confusion. The true significance of inflammation in surgical pathology will only be appreciated when bacterial action is accepted as its only cause. Inflamm.atory reaction appears to have for its primary object the arrest and expulsion of the attacking organisms, and to this extent may be looked uj3on as protective in its nature. Should the issue of the struggle between the tissues and the bacteria be favourable to the latter, the further phases of the inflammatory process are essentially of a destructive character. The idea

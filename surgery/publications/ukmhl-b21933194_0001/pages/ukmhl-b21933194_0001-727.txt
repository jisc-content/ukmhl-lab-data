689 THE HIP-JOINT. moderate, when the hip is flexed it disai>pears, when it is extended the lordosis is exaggerated, and the hand or closed fist may be inserted between the spine and the table (Figs. 261, 262). When the functions of the joint are tested, it will be found that there is rigidity, and that both active and j^assive movements take place at the lumbo-sacral junction instead of at the hip. While rigidity is usually absolute as regards rotation, it may sometimes be possible with care and gentleness to obtain a little increase of flexion. For diagnostic purposes most stress Fig. 261.—Disease of Left Hip—disappearance of lordosis on flexion of tlie hip. should therefore be laid on the absence of rotation—for example, if in a patient who exhibits abduction and flexion, while it is possible to elicit rotation movements, the probability is that he is not suffering from disease of the hip-joint but from some affection in its neighbourhood. The “Thomas flexion test” is founded upon the inability to extend the diseased hip without producing lordosis. By lifting the knee of the sound limb until it touches the chest, the pelvis is fixed and the spine is straightened. If there is flexion deformity, the patient is unable to extend the thigh on the diseased side, and it remains at an angle. If disease is absent the patient can voluntarily extend the limb. VOL. I—44

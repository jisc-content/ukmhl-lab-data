As the ligaments of the joint are not as a rule torn, there is little or no immediate displacement of the fragment. Secondary disjDlacement is liable to occur, however, during the process of union, producing alterations in the “carrying angle” of the limb — cubitus varus or cubitus valgus (Figs. 130 and 131). Fracture of Epicondyles. — Fracture of the external epi- condyle alone is so rare that it need only be mentioned. The internal epicondyle may be chipped off by a fall on the edge of a table or kerb-stone, or it may be forcibly avulsed by trac- tion through the internal lat- eral liga- ment, as an accompani- ment of dislocation. It is usually dis- placed downwards and forwards by flexor muscles attached to it, and may thus come to exert pressure on the ulnar nerve. The fragment may be grasped and made to move on the shaft, producing crepitus. Fibrous union is the usual result. Up to the age of seventeen or eighteen the epiphysis of the epi- condyle may be separated. Treatment of Fractures in region of Elbow.—The administration of a general ansesthetic is a valuable aid to accurate reduction and fix- ation of fractures in this region. Much discussion has taken place as to the best position in which Pig. 130.—Cubitus Varus of Left Arm resulting from Fracture of Internal Condyle of Humerus in childhood.

453 DISLOCATIONS OF THE SHOULDER. axillary border of the scapula just below the glenoid cavity. In almost all cases of dislocation of the shoulder the head of the bone is at least momentarily in this position, but the sharp edge of the scapula and the rounded head are ill adapted to one another, and the position is not long maintained. The subsequent course taken by the humerus depends upon the nature and direction of the force, the position of the limb at the moment of injury, and the relative strength and capacity for effec- tive action of the different grou2)S of muscles acting ujion the bone. In the great major- ity of cases it j^asses forward and inward, and comes to lie against the anterior surface of the neck of thesca^jula, under cover of the tendons of origin of the biceps and coraco- brachialis muscles, constituting the sub- coracoid dislocation. Much less frequently it jjasses still farther in and lies under cover of the j^ectoralis minor and against the edge of the clavicle—the sich- clavicular variety. In rare cases where the violence is extreme the head passes backward and lies against the sjjine on the dorsum of the scaj^ula, beneath the infra-spinatus muscle—the subspinous variety. Other varieties are so rare that they do not call for special mention. Clinical Features common to all Varieties.—Dislocations of the shoulder are commonest in adult males; in advanced life the proportion of female sufferers increases. They are usually attended with great pain, and there is often numbness of the limb due to jiressure of the head of the bone ujion the large nerve-trunks. There is sometimes considerable shock.

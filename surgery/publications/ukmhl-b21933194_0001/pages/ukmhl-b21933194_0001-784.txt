Occasionally it is due to nerve lesions such as peri- pheral neuritis, or to injuries and dis- eases in the region of the ankle where the foot has been allowed to remain for long periods in the attitude of plantar-flexion. In a limited number of cases, the equinus attitude is assumed to compensate for shortening of the limb. In infantile paralysis it is most often unilateral (Fig. 294). If the muscles in front of the leg alone are paralysed, the heel is drawn up by the unojjposed contraction of the calf muscles. If all the muscles of the leg are Fig. 293. — Bilateral Pes paralysed, the foot drops Equinus in a boy »t. 7, the into the equinus attitude result of spastic paralysis, by its own weight. In spastic paralysis, the deformity is frequently bilateral (Fig. 293) and is usually accompanied by ex- cessive arching of the foot (pes cavus) from plantar-flexion at the mid-tarsal joint, and by hyper-extension of the first phalanges and plantar-flexion of the second and third phalanges of the toes —•“ clawing of the toes.” Clinical Features.—In the mildest cases the patient is able to bring the foot to a right angle, and the condition is easily overlooked. In average cases the heel is raised off the ground, and the foot rests on the balls of the toes.

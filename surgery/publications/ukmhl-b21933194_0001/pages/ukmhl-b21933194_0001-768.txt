730 THE DEFORMITIES OP THE EXTREMITIES. There are several varieties. In the congenital forms, which are apparently due to a faulty attitude of the lower extremities in ntero, the patella may be imperfectly developed or absent, and in some cases the tibia is dislocated forwards. The knee is convex backwards, and attempts to flex the joint cause pain. When the deformity is bilateral, the patellm are usually imperfectly developed and the joints are flail-like and permit of lateral movements. The treatment consists in flexing the joint to a right angle under an anesthetic, and maintaining this attitude by means of plaster of Paris or splints until the growth of parts prevents any tendency to relapse. Ac<inired Forms.—The most common acquired form is the result of infantile paralysis, and is described in the next section. The deformity may also be met with in rickets as the result of a backward bend of the tibia immediately below its upper epiphysis—sometimes combined with an exaggerated forward curve of the femur. If there is no prospect of spontaneous rectification, the upper end of the tibia should be divided with the osteotome, and the limb straightened. It may result also from fracture or from separation of one of the epiphyses in the region of the knee, or from cicatricial contraction of the quadriceps. As a result of bone and joint disease, it is met with chiefly in neuro-arthropathies when the knee has become disorganised and flail-like. Deformities of the Knee associated with Infantile and Spastic Paralysis.—When all the muscles acting on the knee are paralysed, the joint may be so fail-like that the patient is unable to stand without the aid of a crutch, or when the weight of the body is put on the limb it assumes the attitude of genu

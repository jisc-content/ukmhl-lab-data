BED-SOEES. Ill to spread both in width and in depth till it reaches the periosteum or bone. Bed-sores over the sacrum sometimes implicate the spinal canal and lead to septic spinal meningitis, which usually proves fatal. In old and debilitated patients the septic absorption taking place from a bed-sore often proves a serious complication of other surgical conditions. From this cause, for example, many old people succumb during the treatment of a fractured thigh. The granulating surface left on the separation of the slough, under appropriate treatment, tends to heal comparatively rapidly.

Prevention of Bed-sores.—The first essential to the prevention of bed-sores is the regular changing of the patient’s position, so that no one part of the body will be continuously pressed upon for any length of time. Ring-}iads of wool, air-cushions, or water- beds are necessary to remove pressure from prominent parts. Absolute di’yness of the skin is all-important. At least once a day the sacrum, buttocks, shoulder-blades, heels, elbows, malleoli, or any other parts exposed to pressure must be sponged with soap and water, thoroughly dried, and then rubbed with methy- lated spirit, which is allowed to dry on the skin.

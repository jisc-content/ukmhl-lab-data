INJURIES. 220 1 the scrotum, the use of Michel’s suture clips is advantageous in so far as these bring the deep surfaces of the skin into accurate apposition, are introduced with comparatively little pain, and leave a very slight mark. When there is any difficulty in bringing the edges of the wound into apposition, a few interru})ted relaxation stitches may be introduced wide of the margins to take the strain off the coaptation stitches (Fig. 53). Stout silk, fishing-gut, or silver wire may be employed for this purpose. When the tension is extreme Lister’s button suture (Fig. 51) may be employed. Re- laxation stitches should be removed in four or five days, and stitches of co- aptation in from ten to fourteen days. Stitches on the face and neck should be removed in two or three days, so as to leave less mark.

When the deeper parts of an extensive wound cannot be brought into accurate apjiosition, and especially when there is any prospect of oozing of blood or serum into the space left—as in amputation stumps or in such wounds as are left after excision of the breast—drainage is indicated. It is a wise precaution also to insert drainage tubes into wounds in very fat

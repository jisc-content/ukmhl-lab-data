127 ANTHRAX. The organisms are found in enormous numbers throughout the bodies of animals wliich have died of anthrax, and are readily recognised and cultivated. Sporulation only takes ])lace outside the body, probably because free oxygen is necessary to the process. In the spore- free condition, the organisms are readily destroyed by ordinary germicides, such as heat, dryness, or chemicals, and by the Fig. 29,—Baeillus of Anthrax from skin vesicle in case of malignant pustule, X 400 diam.

Not only do they remain viable in the dry state for long periods, even up to a year, but they survive boiling for five minutes, and must be subjected to dry heat at 140° C. for several hours before they are destroyed. Clinical Varieties of Anthrax.—In man, anthrax may mani- fest itself in one of three clinical forms. It may be transmitted by means of spores or bacilli directly from a diseased animal to those who, by their occujiation or

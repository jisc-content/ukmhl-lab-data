Traumatic Asphyxia. Syncope, Shock, and Collapse. Syncope, .shock, and collapse are clinical conditions which, although depending on different causes, bear a siiperlicial resem- blance to one another. Syncope is essentially due to a sudden cerebral anaunia; shock to a reflex paralysis of the vaso-inotor centre in the medulla; while the cause of collapse is the abstraction of fluids from the tissues and the blood. Syncope or Fainting.—Syncope is the result of a suddenly produced anamia of the brain, from temporary weakening or arrest of the heart’s action. In surgical practice this condition is usually observed in nervous persons who have been subjected tq pain, as in the reduction of a dislocation or the incision of a whitlow; or in those who have rapidly lost a considerable quantity of blood. It may also follow the sudden withdrawal of fluid from a large cavity, as in tapping an abdomen or withdrawing serous fluid or pus from the pleural cavity. Fainting sometimes occurs also during the administration of chloroform, especially if there is a tendency to sickness and the patient is not completely under. During an operation the onset of syncope is often recognised by the cessation of oozing from the divided vessels in the wound, before the general symptonis become manifest. Clinical Features.—When a person is about to faint he feels giddy, has surging sounds in the ears, and haziness of vision; he yawns, becomes pale and sick, and a free flow of saliva takes place into the mouth. The pupils dilate; the pulse becomes small and almost imperceptilile; the respirations .shallow and

THE LYMPHATICS. 324 certain of permanently curing the patient, because diseased tissue is apt to be left behind; and it is not altogether free from the risk of being followed by dissemination of the tubei’culous infec- tion, and general tuberculosis. In opening a glandular abscess the incision should be large enough to allow of its interior being inspected; it is then possible to introduce the spoon into the various pockets, and especially through the opening in the deep fascia leading down to the gland from which the abscess originated. Success depends on the thoroughness with which all the tuberculous tissue is removed! The wall of the resulting cavity is painted over with tincture of iodine, and the wound is packed with iodoform worsted. The packing is renewed at inter- vals until the wound heals. The healing of such cavities and sinuses is often greatly favoured by repeated applica- tions of the X-rays. Tuberculous disease in the axillary glands may be met with as a result of extension from the glands in the neck, from tuberculous disease of the mamma, ribs, or sternum, or more rarely from tubercul- ous disease in the lingers or arm. Sometimes it is impos- sible to discover the source of infection, in which case we can only assume that it has taken place through the blood-stream. The glands frequently attain a large size, and are usually freely movable. The treat- ment consists in removing them by an operation similar to that employed in clearing out the contents of the axilla in cases of cancer of the breast. In the glands of the groin tuberculous disease is comparatively rare. We have chiefly observed it in the femoral glands as a result of inoculation tubercle on the toes or sole of the foot. The affected glands tend to break down and suppurate, and after Fig. 70.—Hodgkin’s Disease in a boy aged 5. (From Byrom Bramwell’s Atlas of CHnio.al Medicine.)

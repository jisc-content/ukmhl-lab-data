102 GANGRENE. degree of elevation of the limb is an advantage, but it must not be sufficient to diminish the amount of blood entering the part. Hot-bottles are to be used with the utmost caution. As absolute dryness is essential, all ointments or other oily or greasy dressings are to be avoided, as they tend to prevent evaporation from the skin surface. Opium should be given freely to alleviate pain. Excessive stimulation is to be avoided, and the patient should be carefully dieted. Some surgeons advocate the expectant method of treatment, waiting for a line of demarcation to form and allowing the dead part to be spontaneously separated. This takes place so slowly, however, that the majority j^refer to amputate early. In this connection it is worthy of note that there are certain points at which gangrene naturally tends to become arrestedâ€” namely, at the highly vascular areas in the neighbourhood of joints. Thus gangrene of the great toe often stops when it reaches the metatarso-phalangeal joint; or if it trespass this limit it may be arrested either at the tarso-metatarsal or at the ankle joint; If these be passed it usually spreads up the leg to just below the knee before signs of arrestment appear. Further, it is seen from pathological specimens that the spread is greater on the dorsal than on the plantar aspect, and that the death of skin and subcutaneous tissues extends higher than that of bone and muscle. These facts furnish us with valuable indications as to the seat and method of amputation. Experience has proved that in senile gangrene of the lower extremity reliable and satisfactory results are only to be obtained by amputating in the region of the knee, care being taken to perform the operation so as to leave the prepatellar anastomosis intact by retaining the patella in the anterior flap. The operation recommended is disarticulation at

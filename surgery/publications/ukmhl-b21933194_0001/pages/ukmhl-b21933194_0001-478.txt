INJUEIES OF JOINTS. 440 Habitual or recurrent dislocation is almost exclusively met with in the shoulder, and will be described with the injuries of that joint. Pathological Dislocations.—^Joints may become dislocated in the course of certain diseases. These pathological dislocations fall into three groups : (1) those due to gradual stretching of the capsular and other ligaments weakened by inflammatory and suppurative processes, such as sometimes follow on typhoid, scarlet fever or diphtheria, and in j^ysemia; (2) those due to destructive changes in the ligaments and bones—typically seen in tuberculous arthritis, in arthritis deformans, and in Charcot’s disease ; (3) those associated with deformities. These will be considered with the diseases which give rise to them. Congenital Dislocations.—Congenital dislocations are be- lieved to be the result of abnormal or arrested development in utero, and are to be distinguished from dislocations occurring during birth, which are essentially traumatic in origin. They will be described along with deformities.

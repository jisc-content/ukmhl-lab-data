407 FRACTUEES. of the femur and humerus, and the lower end of the radius, it is not uncommon for one fragment to be impacted or wedged into , the substance of the other (Fig. 176). Causes of Displacement. —The factors which influ- ence displacement are chiefly mechanical in their action. Thus the direction and nature of the fracture play an important part. Transverse fractures with roughly serrated ends are less liable to displacement than those which are oblique with more or less smooth surfaces. The direction of the causal force also is a dominant factor in deter- mining the direction in which one or both of the fragments will be displaced. Gravity, acting chiefly upon the distal fragment, also plays a_ part in determin- ing the displacement, for example, in fractures of the thigh or of the bones of the leg, where the lower segment of the limb rolls outwards (Fig. 171), and in fractures of the shaft of the Fig. 96. — Oblique clavicle where the weight Fracture of Upper of the arm carries the Third of Tibia with shoulder downwards, for- Fissurin? of Lower i wards, and inwards.

In certain situations the contraction of unopposed, or of un- equally opposed, groups of muscles plays an important part in

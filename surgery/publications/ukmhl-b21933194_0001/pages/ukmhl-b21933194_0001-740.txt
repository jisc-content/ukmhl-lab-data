702 DISEASES OF INDIVIDUAL JOINTS. the joint locked. There is eburnation of the articular surfaces similar to that seen in other joints. These changes are neces- sarily associated with great restriction of the movements of the j oint, and with striking deformity, which consists in shortening of the limb, usu- ally with eversion and dis- placement of the trochanter upwards and backwards in relation to Nelaton’s line. The clinical features are Fig. 266.—The Upper End of the Femur in advanced. Artliritis Deformans of Hip, showing absorption of neck and down- ward displacement of head of bone. (Museum of Royal College of Surgeons, Edinburgh.) usually so characteristic that there is little difficulty in diagnosis. Restric- tion of the movements of abduction and adduction, the presence of cracking and of grating of the articular sur- faces, and the aggravation of the pain and stiffness after resting the limb, are characteristic of arthritis deformans. The prominence of sciatic pain may lead to the disease being regarded as sciatica. The greatest difficulty is met with in cases where the disease occurs as a monarticular affection in early life, for the resemblance to tuberculous disease of the hip and to coxa vara may be very close. Skiagrams do not always aid in differentiating between them. The local treatment is for the most part palliative, and consists in attempting to maintain the normal movements of the joint.

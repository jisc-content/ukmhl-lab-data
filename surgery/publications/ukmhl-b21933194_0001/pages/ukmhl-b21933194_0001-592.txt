Clinical Features.—Immediately the bone breaks the patient falls, and he is unable to rise again as the limb is at once rendered useless. The power of extending the limb is lost, and the patient is unable to lift his heel off the ground. The knee-joint is filled with blood and serous effusion, which usually extend into the bursa under the quadriceps. The two fragments can be detected, Fig. 197.—Radiogram of Fracture of Patella. (Lent by Mr. George Hamilton, of Livei’iiool.) separated by an interval which admits of the finger being placed between them, and which is increased on flexing the knee. On relaxing the quadriceps the fragments may be approximated more or less completely. Froynosis.—In cases with little displacement, if the frag- ments have been kept in perfect apposition osseous union may take place, but in the great majority of cases, the union is fibrous. In certain cases, the shortening of the quadriceps and the gradual stretching and thinning of the connecting fibrous band may allow of further separation of the fragments (Fig. 198), which to a variable extent interferes with the stability and functions of the limb. The iq)per fragment sometimes becomes attached to the front of the femur, and moves with it in extension, and the fibrous band between the two fragments gradually becomes

Contusion of Muscle.—Contusion of muscle, which con-sists in rupture of its fibres and of blood-vessels, may be due to violence acting from without, as in blows, kicks, or falls; or from within, as by the displacement of a bone in fractures and dislocations. The symptoms are those common to all contusions. The patient complains of severe pain on attempting to use the injured muscle, and maintains an attitude which will relax it. There is subcutaneous ecchymosis if the sheath of the muscle also is torn, and the accumulation of blood may result in the formation of a hsematoma. Restoration of function is usually complete; but when the nerve supplying the muscle is bruised at the same time, as is frequently the case in the deltoid, wasting and loss of function may be very persistent. In exceptional cases the process of repair may be attended with the formation of bone in the substance of the muscle (p. 387). A contused muscle should be placed at rest and supported by cotton wool and a bandage—followed, after an interval, by massage, the use of the continuous current, and appropriate exercises. Sprain of Muscle.—This lesion consists in overstretching and partial rupture of the fibres of a muscle or its aponeurosis. It is of common occurrence in athletes and in those who follow

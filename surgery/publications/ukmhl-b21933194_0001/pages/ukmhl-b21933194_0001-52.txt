24 CONDITIONS INTERFERING WITH REPAIR. that the patient shivers violently, while the skin becomes cold, pale, and shrivelled—cutis anserina. This is a nervous reaction due to a want of correspondence between the internal and the surface temperature of the body, and is known clinically as a rigor. When the temperature rises gradually the chill is usually very slight and may be unobserved. Even during the cold stage, however, the internal temperature is already raised, and by the time the chill has passed off its maximum has been reached. These disturbances seem to follow the absorption of toxins into the blood, and to be due to an interference with the central heat-regulating mechanism. Fig. 5.—Charts of Acute Saiirsemia from (a) case of crushed foot, and {h) case of incomplete abortion. The subsequent course of the temperature chart depends on the nature and amount of the poison absorbed ; whether it is the pure toxin of a single species of organism, or the result of a mixed infection by more than one species ; and whether the supply is intermittent or continuous. It follows, therefore, that certain groups of surgical conditions present particular types of temperature curve resembling one another more or less closely. In acute saprmniia (p. 65), for instance, where the patient absorbs from a localised focus of infection a definite quantity of toxin either in a single large dose or in repeated small doses, the temperature rises rapidly, remains up till the poison is excreted, or till the source of its pro- duction is removed—for example, by amputation—or by the establishment of drainage, after which it falls again and remains normal (Fig. 5). The temperature may fall very rapidly and become markedly sub-= normal (Fig. 5, b). In the condition known as hectic (p. 67), which is a form of chronic

The skin over the head of the first being pressed upon by the boot usually pre- sents a corn, under which a bursa forms (Fig. 305). Both the corn and the bursa are subject to attacks of inflam- mation, which cause consider- able suffering and disability in walking. The soft pai’ts at the distal extremity of the too are flattened out by contact with the sole of the boot— hence the supposed resem- blance to the head of a hammer. On dissection, it is found that the contracture depends on shortening of the plantar portions of the lateral ligaments of the first inter-phalangeal joint, and of the glenoid liga- ment upon which the head of the first phalanx rests. Hammer-toe is usually ascribed to the Fig. 306.—Ooiigeuital Hypertrophy of Left Lower E.xtremity in a boy set. 5.

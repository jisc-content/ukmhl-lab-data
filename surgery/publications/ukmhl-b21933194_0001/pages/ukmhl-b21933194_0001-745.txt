THE KNEE-JOINT. 707 Tuberculous hydrops is to be diagnosed from the effusion which results from si)rain, from the hydrops of gonorrhoea, arthritis deformans, Charcot’s di.sease, and Brodie’s abscess in an adjacent bone, and from the hmmarthrosis met with in bleeders. Given a patient, and especially a young adult with fluid in the knee, and having excluded injury, it is most likely due either to tuberculosis or to gonorrhoea. The presence of melon-seed bodies is confirmatory of the diagno.sis of tubercle. Tuberculous hydrops is specially amenable to conservative treatment by rest and by injections of iodoform. Relapse, however, is not uncommon, and experience shows that if the disease is neglected, there may be a gradual transition from an innocent hydrops to the graver types of synovial tuberculosis. (2) FapiUary or Nodular Tubercle of the Synovial Membrane.—This may be employed as a clinical term to distinguish a condition in which there is a fringy, ]»apillary, or i)oly- poidal growth from the synovial membrane. It is most often met with in adult males between the ages of twenty and forty. The onset and progress are gradual, and the chief complaint is of stiffness and swelling which are worse after exertion. Some times there are .symptoms of loose body, such as occasional locking of the joint, with pain and inability to extend the limb ; but the locking is easily disengaged, and the movements are free again. The patient may give a history of several years partial and inter- mittent disability, with lameness and occasional locking, al- though he may have been able to go about or even to continue his occupation. There is a moderate degree of effusion into the joint, and when this has subsided under rest it may be possible to feel ill-defined cords, or tufts, or nodular mas.ses, and to grasp between the fingers those in the supra-patellar pouch. There is little wasting of muscles, and it is quite exceptional to subcrural bur.sa.

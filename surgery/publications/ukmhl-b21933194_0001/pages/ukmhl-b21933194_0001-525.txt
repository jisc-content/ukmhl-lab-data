The injury may result from a blow on the back of the upper end of the radius, a fall on the outstretched hand, or, in children, Fig. 142.—Radiogram of Forward Dislocation of Radius. (Mr. David Wallace’s case.) (Photograph by Dr. Dawson Turner.) from forcibly dragging the forearm while in the pronated position. The displaced head usually passes forward, and rests on the anterior edge of the capitellum, thus preventing complete flexion and supination of the limb. The limb is flexed and pronated. The di-splaced head of the radius can be felt to rotate with the shaft in its abnormal position, and the articular facet on the head of the radius may

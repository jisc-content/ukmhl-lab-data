CHAPTER XIX. 395 THE BURS^. Anatomy—Normal and adventitious bursae—Injuries : Bursal hsematoma —Diseases : Traumatic or trade bursitis ; Bursal hydrops ; Solid bursal tumour ; Gonorrlimal and suppurative forms of bursitis ; Tuberculous and syphilitic disease—Tumours—Diseases of individual bursm in the upper and lower extremities. A BURSA is a closed sac lined by endothelium and containing synovia. Some are normally present—for example, that between the skin and the patella, and that between the aponeurosis of the gluteus maximus and the great trochanter. Adventitious hursm are developed as a result of abnormal pressure, for example, over the tarsal bones in certain cases of club-foot. Injuries of Bursae.—As a result of contusion, hamiorrhage may occur into the cavity of a bursa and give rise to a bursal haematoma. This is especially liable to occur in bleeders. Such a haematoma may mask a fracture of the bone beneath— for example, fracture of the olecranon process. Acute suppura- tion is a frequent sequel of infected wounds. Diseases of Bursae.—The lining membrane of bursae re- sembles that of joints and tendon sheaths, and is liable to the same forms of disease. Trade or Traumatic Bursitis.—This term may be con- veniently applied to certain affections of bursae which appear to result from repeated slight traumatism incident to particular occupations. The most familiar examples of these are the enlargement of the prepatellar bursa met with in housemaids —the housemaid’s knee (Fig. 91); the enlargement of the olecranon bursa—miner’s elbow ; or ischial bursa—weaver’s or tailor’s bottom (Fig. 89). These affections are characterised by an effusion of fluid into the sac of the bursa with more or less thickening of its lining membrane. While friction and pressure

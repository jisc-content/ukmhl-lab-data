749 PES CALCANEUS Fig. 296.—Pes Calcaneo-valgiis with excessive arching of foot. (From a cast in Mr. Annandale’s collection.) digitorum. If the calf muscles are not completely paralysed and the tendo Achillis is merely stretched, this tendon may be shortened by splitting it longitudin- ally and making the ends overlap, or its insertion may be displaced down- wards. When the ankle is flail-like it may be necessary to perform arthrodesis. The cavus element in the deformity is also to be treated. Pes Calcaneo-valgus. —This deformity, which consists in a combination of dorsi-flexion at the ankle and evension of the foot, is fully as common as pure calcaneus (Fig. 296). The heel is depressed, the sole looks outwards, the arch of the foot is usu- ally aksent and its inner border is convex. Although it may be congenital, it is usually acquired as a result of infantile paralysis. The calf muscles are paralysed while the peronei retain their power and along with the tiliialis anticus and the extensors of the toes become secondarily contracted. Treat- ment is conducted on the same lines as in pes calcaneus. Pes Calcaneo-varus.—In this rare de- formity the heel is depressed and the sole of the foot looks inwards. Pes Cavus.—In this deformity, which is known also as hollow claw-foot, pes arcuatus, or pes excavatus, the longitudinal arch of the foot is exaggerated as a result of the approximation of the balls of the toes to the heel (Fig. 297). It is most frequently met with as an addition to pes equinus or pes calcaneus of paralytic origin, and has already been described. There is a mild form which Fig. 297.—Pes Cavus in association with Pes Equinus, the result of infantile paralysis.

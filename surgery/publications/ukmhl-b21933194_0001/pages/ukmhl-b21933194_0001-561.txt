FRACTURES OF THE NECK OF THE FEMUR. 55.3 forms (Figs. 169 and 172). Chronic changes of the nature of arthritis deformans may occur in and around such false joints. Wlien osseous union fails to take place, although the patient may eventually be able to get about, he can do so only with the aid of a stick or crutch. As the limb is unable to bear the weight of the body, and as there is marked shortening, the patient walks with a decided limj). There is considerable antero-posterior thickening of the neck of the femur, and the femoral vessels may be pushed forward in Scarpa’s triangle. On handling the part the femur may be made to move up and down on the ilium, and there is creaking similar to that met with in arthritis deformans. Treatment.—In treating a fracture through the narrow part of the neck, it is necessary to consider the age and general condition of the patient; whether the fracture is impacted or not; and the site of the fracture—whether in the narrow [>art of the neck or at its base. “ The first indication is to save life, the second to get union, and the third to correct or diminish displacements ” (Stimson). In old and debilitated patients, prolonged confinement to bed in the dorsal attitude is liable to endanger life by favouring hypostatic congestion of the lungs and the formation of bed- sores. Bony or even firm fibrous union seldom takes place in these patients, especially when the fracture is through the narrow part of the neck; and it is generally advisable to get them out of bed as speedily as possible. For the first few days the patient may be kept on his back, the limb being steadied by

FEVEES DUE TO PYOGENIC BACTEEIA. 67 hajiiiatemesis,—the best means of arresting the vomiting is by washing out the stomach. The patient must be fed with nourishing and easily assimilated food. The infusion of saline solution into the veins is sometimes useful in hastening the elimination of the toxins. Chronic Sapraemia or Hectic Fever.—Hectic fever differs from acute sapraemia merely in degree. It usually occurs in connection with tuberculous conditions such as bone or joint disease, psoas abscess, or empyema, which have opened externally, and have thereby become infected with pyogenic organisms. It is gradual in its development, and is of a mild type throughout. The pulse is small, feeble, and compressible, and the tem])erature rises in the afternoon or evening to 102° or 103° F.

In the early morning the temperature suddenly falls to normal or below it, and the patient breaks into a profuse perspiration which leaves him pale, weak, and exhausted. He becomes rapidly and markedly emaciated (Fig. 15), even although in some cases the appetite remains good and is even voracious. The poisons circulating in the blood produce waxy degenera- tion in certain viscera, notably the liver, spleen, kidneys, and intestines. The process begins in the arterial walls and spreads thence to the connective-tissue structures, causing marked en- largement of the affected organs. Albuminuria, ascites, oedema of the lower limbs, clubbing of the fingers, and diarrhoea are among the most iirominent symptoms of this condition. The prognosis in hectic fever depends on the completeness with which the further absorption of toxins can be prevented. In many cases this can only be effected by an operation which provides for free drainage, and, if possible, the removal of infected

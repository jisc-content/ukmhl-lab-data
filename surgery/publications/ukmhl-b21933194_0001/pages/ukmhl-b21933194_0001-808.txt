770 THE DEFOKMITIES OF THE EXTREMITIES. extended, and a well-padded splint is secured to the hand and forearm. The skin on the palmar aspect opposite the first inter- phalangeal joint may give way when the finger is extended; should this occur, the resulting gap may be filled up by a Thiersch graft. The after-treatment consists in massage and passive movements, and a splint (Fig. 311) may be worn at night until there is no longer any tendency to recontraction. Excision of the aflfected portions of fascia is now accepted as an alternative operation, and is to be preferred because it is not followed by relapse. When the little finger is fully fiexed towards the palm, it should be amputated. Supernumerary Fingers (Polydactylism).—These maycoexi,st with supernumerary toes, and the condition is often met with in several members of the same family. The extra finger may be represented by a mere skin appendage the nature of which may only be indicated by the presence of a rudimentary nail, or by a more or less perfectly formed finger. In the majority of cases it should be removed. Congenital Deficiencies in the Number of Fingers.—One or more fingers may be entirely absent, such deficiency being often associated with imjaerfect development of the radius or ulna, or they may be represented by short rounded stumps, these being usually ascribed to the strangulation of the digits by amniotic bands in %Uero—the so-called intra-uterine amputation.

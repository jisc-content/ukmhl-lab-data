CHAPTER XX. yOL. I—26 401 INJURIES OF BONES. Contusions—Wounds—Fractuhes: Pathological; Traumatic ; Varieties ■—Simple fractures—Compound fractures—Separation of Epi- physes—Repair of fractures—Interference with repair. The injuries to which a bone is liable are Contusions, Open Wounds, and Fractures. Contusions of Bone are almost of necessity associated clinically with similar injuries of the overlying soft parts. The mildest degree consists in a bruising of the periosteum, which is raised from the bone by an effusion of blood, constituting a hcumatoma of the loeriosteum. This may be rapidly and completely absorbed, or it may give place to a thickening of the bone {traumatic node), which may persist for long and be attended with deep-seated pain. A contusion may play a part in the etiology of acute osteo-myelitis and of tuberculosis, by furnishing an area of depressed tissue for the lodgment of bacteria circulating in the blood. Treatment.—Rest, elevation, the application of lead and opium fomentations, or of an ice-bag, constitute the best methods of treatment during the first few days. Later, massage and the internal administration of potassium iodide favour the absorption of effusions and nodes. When the skin is broken the condition approaches that of a compound fracture, and is treated on the same lines. Open Wounds of Bone of the incised and contused varieties are usually produced by cuts with sabres, axes, butcher’s knives, scythes, or by circular saws. Punctured wounds are caused by bayonets, arrows, or other pointed instruments. They are all equivalent to compound, incomplete fractures. Gun-shot inf cries of bone have already been described (p. 228).

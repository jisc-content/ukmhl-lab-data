627 SAECOMA. (1) The soft cellular tximours are composed mainly of spindle or round cells ; they grow chiefly from the marrow of the spongy ends of the long bones, the diploe of the skull, the pelvis, vertebras, and jaws. As they grow they may cause little al- teration in the contour of the bone, but they eat away its framework and replace it, so that the continuity of the bone is maintained only by tumour tissue and pathological fracture is a frequent result. The small round-celled sarcomata are among Fig. 240. — Periosteal Sarcoma of Head of Fibula, from child aet. 8. Fig. 241.—Central Sarcoma of Lower End of Femur, invading the knee-joint. (Museum of Royal College of Surgeons, Edinburgh.) the most malignant tumours of bone, growing with great rapidity, and giving rise to secondary growths at an early stage. (2) The second group includes the fibro-, osteo-, and chondro- sarcomata, and combinations of these; in all of them fully formed tissue predominates over the cellular elements. They grow chiefly from the deeper layer of the periosteum, and at first form a projection on the surface, but later tend to

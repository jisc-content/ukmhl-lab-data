507 FRACTURES OF PHALANGES. and, on account of the supei’ficial position of the bones, are often compound, and attended with much bruising of soft parts. Force applied to the distal end of the finger also may fracture a phalanx. The proximal phalanges are broken oftener than the others. The deformity is usually angular, with the apex towards the palm, and if union takes place in this position, flexion and grasping are interfered with. Unnatural molhlity and crepitus can usually be recognised, but, on account of the swelling and tenderness, diagnosis is sometimes very difficult. Firm union takes place in two or three weeks. In oblique and comminuted Fig. 159.—Tracing of Kadiogram of Fracture of Second Phalanx of Little Finger. Phalanx united, showing thickening from callus formation. fractures, union may take place with overlapping, [)roducing a deformity which is sometimes troublesome by preventing the wearing of a glove or of rings. In compound fractures non- union sometimes occurs and causes persistent disability. In doubtful cases radioscopy renders valuable aid, as the parts are readily seen by the screen. Treatment.—The contiguous fingers .should be utilised as lateral splints, while a long palmar splint projecting beyond the fingers is employed to control the wrist-joint. Early movement and massage are necessary to prevent adhesions of tendons and consequent stiffness. In oblique and comminuted fractures, it

213 GANGLION. Ganglion. This term is apiilied to a cyst filled with a clear jelly or colloid material, and usually met with iii the immediate vicinity of a joint. The carpal ganglion—poimlarly known as a sprained sinew— is met with as a smooth, rounded, or oval swelling on the dorsal aspect of the carpus, usually towards its radial side (Fig. 50). It is situated over one of the intercarpal or other joints in this region, and may appear to be connected with one or other of the ex- tensor tendons. The skin and fascia are movable over the cyst. The cyst varies in size from apea toapigeon’s egg; having attained its maximum size within a few months, it undergoes no further increase. It becomes tense and‘ more pro- minent when the hand is flexed towards the palm. Its appearance is usually ascribed to some strain of the wrist—for example, in girls learning gym- nastics, or in women after a heavy washing. It may cause no symptoms beyond the deformity, or it may interfere with the use of the hand, especially in grasping move- ments and when the hand is dorsiflexed. In females it may give rise to pain which .shoots up the arm. The tarsal ganglion is situated on the dorsum of the foot over one or other of the intertarsal joints. It is usually smaller, flatter, and more tense than that met with over the wrist, so that it is sometimes mistaken for a bony tumour. It rarely Fig. 50.—Carpal Ganglion in a woman aged 25.

.365 ELEPHANTIASIS. the best-known example is trojncal elephantiasis (E. arabimi), which is endemic in Samoa, Barbadoes, and certain other places. It attacks the lower extremity or the external genitals in either sex (Fig. 79). The disease is nsnally ushered in with fever, and signs of inflammation, of the nature of lymphangitis, in the l>art affected. After a number of such attacks, the lymphatic vessels appear to become obliterated, and the skin and subcuta- neous cellular tis.sue, being bathed in stagnant lymph — which Fig. 79.—Elephantia.sis of Penis and Scrotum in native of Demerar.a. (Mr. Annantlale's case.) possibly contains the products of streptococci—take on an over- growth, which continues until the part assumes gigantic projicr- tions. In a certain number of cases the lymphatic trunks have been found to be blocked with the ova of the fllaria sanguinis hominis or with the parent worms. It must be clearly understood, however, that cases of elephantiasis of the lower extremity are met with in this country in which there are no filarial parasites in the lymphatics. These cases present features indistinguish- able from the tropical variety, and usually follow upon repeated attacks of lymphangitis or erysipelas. The part affected with elephantia.sis is enormously increased

575 DISLOCATIONS IN IlEGION OF ANKLE. Treatment. — Tlie patient iiaving been anse.sthetised, tlie foot is extended and tlie knee and hip joints tiexed in ordei’ to relax the calf muscles as completely as possible. Traction is then made upon the foot, while counter-extension is apjilied to the leg, and the bones are manipulated into position. Reduction usually takes place gradually without the characteristic snap which accomi»anies reduction of mo.st dislocations. It is sometimes necessary to divide the tendo Achillis, particularly in cases of forward di.slocation. When the astragalus passesu[>wardsbetweenthetibiaand fibula, it is sometimes impossible to effect reduction by manipulation, and the best results are then obtained by excising the bone. The after-treatment of dislocations of the ankle consists in Fig. 216.—Compound Dislocation of the Astragalus. (Dr. Will. Stewart’s case.) keeping the leg on a pillow between sand-bags, and applying massage to the foot and ankle. In compound dislocations which have become infected primary amputation may be indicated, but in young and healthy subjects an attempt should be made to save the foot. Dislocation of the astragalus from its articulations with the bones of the leg above and the os calcis and scaphoid below, is a comparatively common injury, and results from a violent wrench of the foot. It may be incomplete or complete When the foot is plantar-fiexed at the moment of injury the displace- ment is generally forward with a tendency outward. The astragalus comes to rest on the external cuneiform and cuboid bones, the foot being adducted, inverted, and di.splaced bodily inward. In a large pro})ortion of cases the di.slocation is com- })Ound, more or less of the astragalus being forced through the skin (Fig. 216). When the foot is dorsifiexed at the moment of injury the

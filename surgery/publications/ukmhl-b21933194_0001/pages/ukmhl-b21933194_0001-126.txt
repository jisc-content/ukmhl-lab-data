GANGEENE. 98 malleolus, the internal condyle of the humerus or femur, or over the dorsum of the foot. This is especially liable to occur when the nutrition of the skin is depressed by any interference with its nerve-supply, such as follows injuries to the spine or peripheral nerves, diseases of the brain, or infantile paralysis. On removing the splint the part pressed upon is found to be of a pale yellow or grey colour, and is surrounded by a ring of hypersemic or congested skin. If purified and protected from septic infection the clinical course is that of typical dry gangrene. Closely allied to this is the bed-sore in which sloughs of the Fig. skin and soft parts often form. Bed-sores will be described at the end of this chapter. Treatment.—The first indication in the treatment of the above varieties of gangrene is the exclusion of bacteria by thorough purification of the damaged tissue and its surroundings, and the application of dry, non-irritating antiseptic dressings. When these measures are successful dry gangrene ensues. The raw surface left after the separation of a slough of the skin may be allowed to heal by granulation, or may be covered by Thiersch skin-grafts. In the case of fingers or limbs it is not necessary to wait until spontaneous separation takes place, as this is often a very slow and tedious process. When a well-marked line of demarcation has formed, amputation may be performed just sufficiently far above it to enable suitable flaps to be made. 22.—Carliolic Gangrene. Girl set. 22. Carbolic compress (1 in 60) applied overnight. Finger gangrenous in the morning.

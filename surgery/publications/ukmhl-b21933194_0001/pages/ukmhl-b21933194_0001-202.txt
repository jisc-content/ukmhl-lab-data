SYPHILIS. 174 granulation tissue is diffused throughout the connective-tissue framework of such organs as the tongue or liver, and which is known as gummatous infiltration or syphilitic cirrhosis. The life-history of an untreated gumma varies with its environment. When protected frojn injury and irritation in the substance of an internal organ such as the liver, it may become encapsulated by fibrous tissue and persist in this condition for an indefinite period, or it may be absorbed and leave in its place a fibrous cicatrix. In the interior of a long bone it may replace the rigid framework of the shaft to such an extent as to lead to pathological fracture. If it is near the surface of the body —as for example, in the subcutaneous or sub- mucous cellular tissue, or in the periosteum of a superficial bone, such as the palate, the skull, or the tibia—the tissue of which it is composed is very apt to undergo necrosis in which the overlying skin or mucous membrane frequently participates, the result being an ulcer — the tertiary syphilitic ulcer (Figs. 19, 37). Tertiary Lesions of the Skin and Subcutane- ous Cellular Tissue.—The clinical subcutaneous gumma are those of an indolent, painless, elastic swelling, varying in size from that of a pea to that of an almond or walnut. After a variable period it usually softens in the centre, the skin over it becomes livid and dusky, and finally separates as a slough, ex- posing the tissue of the gumma, which sometimes appears as a mucoid, yellowish, honey-like substance; more frequently as a sodden, caseated tissue resembling wash-leather. The caseated tissue of a gumma differs from the corresponding tissue of a tuberculous lesion in being tough and firm, of a buff colour like Fig. 37.—Tertiary Syphilitic Ulceration in region of Knee and on both Thumbs of woman set. 37.

INJURIES OP WRIST AND HAND. 508 may be necessary to anaestlietise the patient to effect reduction ; and in some cases extension applied in the same way as for fracture of a metacarpal is useful. When it is particularly desirable to avoid deformity an open operation may be advisable. Dislocations.—Dislocations of the metaearpo - phalangeal joint of the thumb.—The commonest dislocation at this joint is a backward displacement of the proximal phalanx, which may be complete or incomplete. Its special clinical importance lies in the fact that much difficulty is often experienced in effecting reduction. This dislocation is usually produced by extreme dorsiflexiou of the thumb, whereby the palmar or glenoid and the lateral ligaments are torn from their metacarpal attachments, the phalanx carrying with it the glenoid ligament and sesamoid bones. The head of the metacarpal bone passes forward between the two heads of the flexor brevis pollicis, and the tendon of tlie long flexor slips to the ulnar side. The phalanx passes on to the dorsum of the metacarpal, where it is held erect by the tension of the abductor and adductor muscles. The attitude of the thumb is characteristic (Fig. 160).

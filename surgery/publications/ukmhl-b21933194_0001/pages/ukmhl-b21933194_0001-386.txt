In the groove behind the- elbow it may be contused by a blow, or compressed or torn in fractures of the internal condyle of the humerus, or it may be accidentally divided in the operation for excising the elbow-joint, In the forearm it supplies the flexor carpi ulnaris and the ulnar half of the flexor profundus digitorum; and in the hand, the short muscles of the little finger, the interossei, the two ulnar Fig. 78.â€”To illustrate Loss of Sensation produced by complete Division of Ulnar Nerve. Loss of all forms of cutaneous sensibility is rejiresented by tire shaded area. The parts insensitive to light touch and to intermediate degrees of heat and cold are enclosed within the dotted line. (Head and Sherreu.) lumbricals, the adductor, and inner head of the flexor brevis pollicis. When divided just above the wrist, owing to the resulting paralysis of the interossei and inner lumbricals, the fingers cannot be flexed at the metacarpo-phalangeal joints or extended at the inter-phalangeal joints, the disability chiefly afl'ecting the ring and little fingers. The fingers can neither be adducted nor abducted, and the interosseous spaces are hollowed out from wasting of the interossei. There is loss of adduction of the thumb, and of abduction of the little finger, which can no longer be opposed to the thumb. There is wasting of the hypothenar,

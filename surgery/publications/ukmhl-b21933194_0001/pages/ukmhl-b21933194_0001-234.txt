The treatment of cancer by other than operative methods has received a great deal of attention within recent years. Various anti-cancerous sera have been introduced but have not yielded the results claimed on their behalf. The repeated application Fig. 48.—Squamous Epithelioma of the Scalp. of the Edntgen rays has proved to be of great value in the treatment of cancers situated in or near the skin and accessible mucous surfaces. In rodent cancer the rays are definitely curative and get rid of the disease with less disfigurement than results from operative methods. In squamous epithelioma a cure is much less certain, and in the cutaneous nodules of cancer secondary to disease in the breast the infiuence of the rays is rather to retard or inhibit their growth than to cause their disappearance. In the case of cancerous ulcers the rays tend to relieve pain, to diminish discharge and haemorrhage, and may

INHEEITED SYPHILIS. 185 should be dilated with atropin from time to time, especially in cases complicated with iritis. Acquired Syphilis in Infants and Young Children.—When syphilis is met with in infants and young children, it is apt to be taken for granted that the disease has been inherited. It is possible, however, for them to acquire the disease—as, for example, while passing through the maternal passages during birth, through being nursed or kissed by infected women, or through the rite of circumcision. The risk of infection which formerly existed by the arm-to-arm method of vaccination has been abolished by the general use of calf lymph. The clinical features of the acquired disease in infants and young children are very similar to those observed in the adult, with a tendency, however, to be more severe, probably. because the disease is often late in being recognised and treated.

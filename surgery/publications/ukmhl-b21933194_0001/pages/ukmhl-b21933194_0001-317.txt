VARIETIES OF ANEURYSM. 289 media being already damaged, or, it may be, destroyed, by the primary disease, the stress falls on the adventitia, which in the majority of cases constitutes the sac. To withstand the pressure the outer coat becomes thickened, and as the aneurysm increases in size it forms adhesions to surrounding tissues, so that fasciae, tendons, nerves, and other structures may be found matted together in the wall of the aneurysm. The wall is further strengthened by the deposit on its inner aspect of blood-clot, which may eventually become organised. The contents of the aneurysmal sac consist of fluid blood, and a varying amount of blood-clot which is deposited in con- centric layers on the inner aspect of the sac, constituting a laminated clot. Near the blood current the clot is soft, red. Pig. 65.—Sacculated Aneury.sm of Abdominal Aorta nearly filled with laminated clot. Note greater density of clot towards peri]ihery. and friable; while near the wall it is pale and firm (Fig. 65). The laminated clot not only strengthens the sac, enabling it to resist the blood pressure and so prevent rupture, but, if it increases sufficiently to fill the cavity, may bring about cure. The principle upon which all methods of treatment are based is to imitate nature in producing such a clot. An aneurysm is said to be diffused when the sac ruptures and the blood escapes into the surrounding tissues. When one or more of the coats of the artery enter into the formation of the sac, the aneurysm is sometimes called a “true aneurysm ”; while the term “ false ” is applied when all the coats have given way and the sac is formed entirely by con- densation of the surrounding structures. These terms, however, have been used in so many different senses, and are in them- selves so misleading, that we do not employ them. Dissecting Aneurysm.—The blood may force its way VOL. I—19

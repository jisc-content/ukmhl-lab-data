VARIX—VARICOSE VEINS. 277 ■some ca.ses the thickening is uniform, and in others it is irregular, so that here and there thin-walled sacs or pouches project from the side of the vein (Eig. 59). These pouches vary in size from a bean to a hen’s egg, the larger forms being called venous ajsts, and being most commonly met with in the region of the sai)henous oi^ening and of the opening in the popliteal fascia. Such pouches, being exposed to injury, are frequent- ly the seat of throm- bosis. The essential ana- tomical lesion is the absence or deficiency of valves, so that they are incompetent and fail to support the column of blood which bears back upon them. Nor- mally the valves in the femoral and iliac veins and in the inferior vena cava are slightly, if at all, developed, so that in the erect posture the internal saphena receives a large share of the backward pres- sure of the column of venous blood. Clinical Features. —The majority of cases are seen in patients between puberty and the age of thirty, and the sexes appear to suffer about equally. The amount of discomfort caused by varicose veins bears no direct proi)ortion to the degree of varicosity. It depends rather upon the degree of pressure in the veins, as is shown by the fact that it is relieved by elevation of the limb. When the main trunk of the internal saphena is implicated, its valves being incompetent the pressure in the vein is high and the patient suffers a good deal of pain and discomfort. When, on the t’lG. 60.—E.xteiisive Varix of Internal Sapliena System on Left Leg, and slight Varix of External Sai)hena System on Right Leg.

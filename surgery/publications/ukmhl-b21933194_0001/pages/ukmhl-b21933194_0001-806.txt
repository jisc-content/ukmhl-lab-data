768 THE DEFORMITIES OF THE EXTREMITIES. Congenital contraction of the fingers is comparatively common. It is an inherited deformity, and is often met with in several members of the same family. It most frequently affects the little or the ring and little fingers (Fig. 309). The second and third phalanges are flexed towards the palm; the first phalanx is dorsi-flexed, this being the reverse of what is observed in Dupuytren’s contraction. The affection is u.sually disregarded in infancy and childhood as being of no importance. Its etio- logy is not known. In the first stage, the deformity is easily corrected by the child wearing a light splint fixed with strips of plaster, or a piece of whalebone or steel inside the finger of a glove. At a later stage, the tense ligaments on the palmar- aspect may require to be divided subcutaneou.sly before it is possible to extend the finger. A retentive splint must be worn for a long period, at first night and day, and later dirring the night only. Dupuytren’s Contraction.—This is an acquired deformity resulting from contraction of the palmar fascia and its digital prolongations (Fig. 310). It is rare in childhood and youth, but is common after middle life, especially in men. It is met with chiefly in those who are predisposed to it by inheritance or by gout, and in tho.se who are liable to arthritis deformans. While sometimes seen in the working classes and attributed to the pressure of some hard object on the palm of the hand—such as a hammer or shovel or whip—its greater frequency in those who Fig. 310.—Dupuytren’s Contraction.

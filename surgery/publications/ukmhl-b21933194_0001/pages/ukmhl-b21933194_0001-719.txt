681 THE SHOULDER-JOINT. immediately outside the coracoid, or just below the junction of the acromion and spine of the scapula. Cold abscess is treated on the usual lines (p. 150). Operation is indicated in cases which do not yield to conservative measures. Excision of the joint is a very satisfactory o})eration, and although a close iibrous ankylosis usually occurs, the arm is a u.seful one. Pyogenic Diseases.—The shouldei'-joint may be infected by extension of sup])urative periostitis and osteo- myelitis from the upper end of the humerus, or from suppuration in the axilla, or through the Wood-stream by ordinary pus organisms, })neu- mococci, typhoid bacilli, or gonococci. Extension should be applied to the upper arm abducted at a right angle. When it is necessary to drain the joint, the incision should be placed anteriorly in the line of the bicipital groove, and a counter - opening made on the posterior aspect by cutting on the point of a dress- ing force[)S introduced through the anterior in- cision. Arthritis Deformans.— The shoulder is seldom the only joint affected, except when the arthritis is a sequel to injury. The common type of lesion is a dry arthritis with fibrillation and sub- sequent eburnation of the articular surfaces. The long tendon of the biceps is usu- ally destroyed, and the head of the bone may be drawn upwards, and, after wearing through the capsule, rubs on the under surface of the acromion. The prominent clinical features are i)ain, stiffness, and crackling on movement. Neuro-arthropathies of the shoulder are met with chiefiy in cases of syringomyelia. The clinical features may be a large and jjainless swelling with fiuctuation, or marked and rajfid wasting of the deltoid and scapular muscles with flail-like movements of the joint, associated with disappearance of the upper end of the humerus (Fig. 257).

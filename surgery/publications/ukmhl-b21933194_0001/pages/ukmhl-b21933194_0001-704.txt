666 DISEASES OF JOINTS. which hang into the cavity of the joint (Fig. 249). The term arborescent lipoma is applied to the condition when fringes composed of fat are developed to an exaggerated degree. In- dividual fringes may undergo special enlargement and form pendulous growths, in the interior of which cartilage and bone may be formed; these may attain the size of a hazel-nut or even of a walnut. Whether they remain attached to the synovial membrane by their pedicles, or are free, they may give rise to the symptoms associated with the presence of a loose body in the joint (p. 676). When the synovial changes are prominent, there is usually considerable serous effusion into the joint, con- stituting one form of hydrops. As regards the progress of the disease, it is usually observed that in patients who are still young its tendency is to advance Fig. 250.—Arthritis Deformans of Hands, showing symmetry of lesions, ulnar deviation of fingers, and nodular thickening at inter-phalangeal joints. with considerable rapidity, so that in the course of a few months it may cause serious crippling of several joints. In older jratients its progress is much more gradual. The disease is quite compatible with long life. The dry form of arthritis deformans (arthritis sicca), although specially common in the knee, is met with frequently in other joints, either as a monarticular or poly-articular disease; and it is also very common in the joints of the spine and of the fingers, as Avell as in the tempero-maxillary joint. In the joints of the fingers in older patients the disease is remarkably sym- metrical, and tends to assume a nodular tyj^e (Heberden’s nodes) (Fig. 2.50); whereas in younger subjects it assumes a more crijjpling, painful, and progressive fusiform type (Fig. 251). In the larger joints the subjective symptoms usually precede any palpable evidence of disease. The patient complains of stiffness, crackings, and aching, aggravated by

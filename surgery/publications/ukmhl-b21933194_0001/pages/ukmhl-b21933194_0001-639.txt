TUBERCULOUS DISEASES. 601 with the object of obtaining primary union ; otherwise it is treated by the open method. Tuberculous Osteomyelitis.— Tuberculous lesions in the marrow occur as isolated or multiple foci of tuberculous granulation tissue, which replaces the marrow and eats away the trabeculiB of bone in its vicinity. If the 131'ocess spreads in the marrow as a diffuse caseous infiltration, death of bone on a considerable scale may ensue, giving rise to sequestra. When these involve an articular surface they are usually wedge-shaped (Fig. 270); in other situations they are rounded or irregular. When the death of bone is preceded by sclerosis, the sequestrum is denser than normal bone. Finally, the sequestrum lies loose in a cavity lined by tuberculous granulation tissue. In diffuse lesions of the shaft of a long bone, the continued absorption of bone in the interior, while new bone is laid down by the periosteum, results in an expansion of the bone to which the name spina ventosa was formerly applied (Fig. 223). Clinical Features. — As a rule it is only in superficially placed bones such as the tibia, ulna, clavicle, lower jaw, or phalanges, that tirbercul- ous disease in the marrow gives rise to signs suffi- ciently definite to allow of its clinical recognition. In the vertebras, or in the con- stituent bones of deeply seated joints, such as the hip or shoulder, the exist- ence of tuberculous lesions in the marrow may only be inferred from indirect signs—such, for example, as rigidity and curvature in the case of the spine, or from the synqstoms of grave and persistent joint-disease in the case of the hip or shoulder.

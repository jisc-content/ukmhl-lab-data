GANGLION. 215 probably, therefore, of the nature of degeneration cysts arising in the capsule of joints. Treatment.—If a ganglion causes deformity or disability, it can be got rid of by an aseptic modification of the old- fa.shioned seton. The overlying skin and cyst wall are trans- fixed by a stout curved needle carrying a double thread of thick silk-worm gut, the ends of which are cut short, and a dressing applied. A week later the threads arc removed and the minute punctures sealed with collodion. The action of the threads is to excite an aseptic granulation of the cyst wall, which results in its obliteration. When this fails, recourse should be had to excision. Puncture with a tenotomy knife and scraping the interior, and the injection of irritants, are alternative, but less satisfactory, methods of treatment. The so-called “ compound palmar ganglion ” has been shown to be a tuberculous disease of the tendon sheaths, and will be described with the diseases of tendon sheaths.

490 INJURIES OF ELBOW AND FOREARM. pronator radii teres, its upper fragment may be supinated by the biceps and supinator brevis, while the lower fragment remains in the usual semi-prone position. If union takes place in this position the power of complete supination is perma- nently lost. The usual symptoms of fracture are present, and there is seldom any difficulty in diagnosis. The prognosis must be guarded, especially with regard to the preservation of pronation and supination. These move- ments may be interfered with if union takes place in a bad position with angular or rotatory deformity of one or both bones, or if callus is formed in excess and causes locking of the bones. In some cases the callus fuses the two bones across the interosseous space and pronation and supination are rendered impossible. Persistent angular deformity of the forearm is also liable to Fig. 143.—Greenstick Fracture of both Bones of the Forearm. ensue, either from failure to correct the displacement primarily, or from subsequent bending due to ill-applied sjjlints or slings. Want of union, or the formation of a false joint in one or both bones, is sometimes met with, and seriously impairs the useful- ness of the limb. A considerable number of cases of gangrene of the limb after simple fracture of the forearm are on record. This is sometimes attributable to damage inflicted upon the blood-vessels by the fractured bones, or to the force which caused the fracture, but is oftener due to a roller bandage applied underneath the splints strangulating the limb, to injudiciously applied pads, or to too tight bandaging over the splints. In uncomplicated cases union takes place in from three to four weeks. Treatment.—To ensure accurate reduction and coaptation a

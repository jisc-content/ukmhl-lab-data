Definition of Terms.—The term synovitis is applied to any inflammatory condition which is confined to the synovial membrane of a joint. Synovitis is usually associated with effusion into the cavity of the joint of fluid, which may be serous, sero-fibrinous, or purulent. As the term synovitis merely refers to the tissue involved in the inflammation, it should always be used with an adjective — such as gouty, gonorrhoeal, or tuberculous—which indicates its distinctive pathological nature. The terms hydrops, hydrarthrosis, and chronic serous synovitis are synonymous, and are employed when effusion into the joint is the most prominent clinical feature. Hydrops may occur apart from disease—for example, in the knee-joint, from repeated sprains—but is met with chiefly in the chronic and intermittent forms of synovitis which result from gonorrhoea, tuberculosis, syphilis, arthritis deformans, or arthropathies of nerve origin. It may occur also when there is a loose body in a joint. Arthritis is the term applied when not only the synovial membrane but the articular surfaces, and it may be also the ends of the bones, are involved in the disease. As in speaking of synovitis, so in using the term arthritis it is necessary to jirefix a qualifying adjective which indicates its

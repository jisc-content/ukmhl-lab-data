568 INJURIES IN REGION OF ANKLE AND FOOT. •stretching the skin, which may give way if the patient atteinpt.s to walk. The foot having lost the support of the malleoli, is often displaced backward, and the toes are pointed by the contraction of the calf nmsch;s. There is abnormal mobility—both lateral and antero-posterior—and crepitus may be elicited. The points of tenderness are over the internal lateral ligament or internal analleolus, according to which is damaged; the inferior tibio- fibular joint, and at the seat of fracture of the fibula. Distal nressure over the shaft of the fibula, or on the extreme tip of Fig. 210.—Ambulant Splint of Plaster-of-Paris. the malleolus, may elicit pain and crepitus at the seat of fracture. There is usually considerable ecchymosis and swelling in the hollows below and behind the malleoli; and the malleoli appear to be nearer the level of the sole. In Dupuytren’s fracture, when the astragalus passes up between the tibia and fibula, there is great broadening of the ankle. There is often considei’able difficulty in distinguishing a sprain of the ankle from a fracture without displacement, as both forms of injury result from the same kinds of violence, and are rapidly followed by swelling and discoloration of the overlying soft parts. In a sprain, the point of maximum tender- ness is over the ligaments that have been damaged, whereas

FRACTURES OF THE RONES OF THE LEG. SGI time corrected. The normal ontline of the leg is restored when the ball of the great toe, the internal malleolus, and the inner edge of the patella are in the .same plane. The retentive apparatus to be api)lied depends, upon the tendency to redisplacement, the degree of swelling, and the extent of the damage to the skin. In transverse fractures with a moderate amount of swelling and intact skin, the limb may immediately be enclosed in a rigid apparatus, such as lateral poroplastic splints retained in position by an elastic bandage or a Croft’s splint, which admits of mas.sage being carried out from the first. When the fracture is in the lower third of the leg the ambulatory .splint (Fig. 210) gives excellent results, and is of special service in hospital practice. This splint allows of a certain amount of movement Fig. 204.—Recent Fr.acture of botli Bones of Leg in Lower Tliird by direct violence. of the muscles, and it is usually found when it is removed at the end of three or four weeks that the ankle is freely movable and there is no atrophy of muscles. When the fracture is oblique and it is difficult to retain the fragments in position, or when there is great sw^elling with bullaj or bruises on the .skin, a splint which admits of easy access to the limb is to be preferred. One of the simplest and most efficient is the box splint (Fig. 205). This consists of two pieces of wood extending from above the knee to an inch or two beyond the sole, and a little broader than the maximum diameter of the leg. The.se are rolled into the o}>posite ends of a folded sheet so as to form two sides of a box, of which the sheet constitutes a third side. It is found advantageous to imsert another board, fitted with a foot-piece, between the folds of the sheet forming the third side of the box, to add to the rigidity of the splint, and to aid in controlling the foot. By folding one side of the sheet somewhat obli(|irely, the box is VOL, I—36

If the pelvis is in its normal position, the two lines intersect at right angles; if it is tilted, the angles at the point of intersection are unequal. The flexion of the thigh may be largely compensated for by increasing the forward curve of the lumbar spine (lordosis) and by flexing the leg at the knee. There may also be an attempt to compensate for the eversion of the limb by rotating the pelvis forwards on the affected side. To demonstrate the lordosis the patient should be laid on a flat table; in the resting position, the lordosis is action of muscles ; but when it is prolonged, the muscles, fascise, and ligaments undergo shortening, so that it becomes fixed. On looking at the patient the abnormal attitude may not be at once evident, as he usually restores the parallelism of the limbs by lowering the pelvis on the affected side and adducting the sound limb. This obliquity or tilting of the pelvis causes apparent lengthening of the diseased limb. It is best demon- strated by drawing one straight line between the anterior iliac

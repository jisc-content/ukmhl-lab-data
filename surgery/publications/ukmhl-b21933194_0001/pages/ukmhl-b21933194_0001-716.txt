DISEASES OF JOINTS. 678 They are usually solitary, about the size of a bean or almond, concavo-convex in shape, the convex aspect being smooth like an articular surface, the concave aspect more often uneven and nodulated (Fig. 256). Such bodies may be lodged in a kind of compartment or excavation in one of the articular surfaces, usually one or other condyle of the femur, from which they may be readily shelled out by means of an elevator. They usually present on section a nucleus or core of spongy bone or of calcified cartilage. As to the origin of these bodies, some maintain that they result from the detachment by injury of a portion of the articular surface, while others regard them as overgrowths derived from the synovial membrane. Konig regards them as portions of the articular surfaces which have been detached by a morbid process which he calls “ osteochondritis dissecans.” Displacement of the semilunar cartilages in the knee is referred to with injuries of that joint (p. 548).

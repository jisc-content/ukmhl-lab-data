491 FRACTURES OF THE FOREARM. general anaesthetic is usually necessary. In the greenstick variety the bones must be completely straightened, the fracture being rendered complete, if necessary, for this purpose. To retain the bones in position anterior and posterior wooden splints are then apjdied. These are made to overlap the fore- arm by about half an inch on each side, to avoid compressing the forearm laterally and so making the fractured ends encroach upon the interosseous space. The dorsal sjdint is usually made to extend from the olecranon to the knuckles, and the palmar one from the bend of the elbow to the flexure in the middle of the palm, a piece being cut out to avoid pressure on the ball of the thumb (Fig. 144). The splints are applied with the elbow flexed to a right angle, and, except when the radius is broken above the level of the insertion of the pronator radii teres, with the forearm midway between pronation and supi- nation. An external rectangular splint is then applied, and the limb supported Iry a sling, so adjusted that it supports equally the hand and elbow, in order to avoid angular deformity. The use of special interosseous pads is to be avoided, as they are liable to cause gangrene of the skin. When the fracture of the radius is above the insertion of the Fig. 144.—Goocli Splints for Frac- ture of both Bones of Forearm. (These are applied with the wooden side towards tlie .skin.) Fig. 145.—Splints applied for Fracture of Forearm. pronator radii teres, the forearm should be fixed in the position of complete supination with the elbow flexed to an acute angle, and retained in this position by moulded anterior and posterior splints. This position is very irksome to the patient, and great care is necessary in the adjustment of the apparatus to prevent pronation. Massage and movement should be carried out early. It is

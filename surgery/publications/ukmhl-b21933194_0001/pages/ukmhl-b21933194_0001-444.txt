INJURIES OF BONES. 406 exactly at right angles to its long axis. These usually result from direct violence or from end to end pressure. Longitudinal fractures extending the greater part of the length of a long bone are exceedingly rare. Oblique fractures are very common, and result usually from indirect violence, bend- ing, or torsion (Figs. 96, 97). Spiral fractures result from forcible torsion of a long bone, and are met with most frequently in the tibia, femur, and humerus (Fig. 95). (3) According to the Re- lative Position of the Frag- ments.—The bone may be completely broken across, yet its ends remain in ap- position, in which case there is said to be no displacement. There may be an angular dis- placement—for example, in greenstick fracture; or the ends may overlap one an- other although they do not completely part company. In transverse fractures of the patella or of the ole- cranon there is often dis- traction or pulling apart of the fragments (Fig. 197). The broken ends, especi- *Fracture of Tibia ally in oblique fractures, and Oblique may override one another.

The fragments may be de- pressed, as in the flat bones of the skull or the nasal bones.

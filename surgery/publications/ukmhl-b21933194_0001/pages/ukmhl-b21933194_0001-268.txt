240 INJURIES. blood-vessels and nerves are exposed. A line of demarcation eventually forms, but the sloughs are exceedingly slow to separate, taking from three to five times as long as in an ordinary burn, and during the process of separation there is considerable risk of secondary hsemorrhage taking place from erosion of large vessels. Treatment.—Electrical burns are treated on the same lines as ordinary burns, by thorough purification and the application of dry antiseptic dressings, with a view to avoiding the onset of moist gangrene. After this has occurred and granulations have formed, skin-grafting is of great value in hastening healing. Lightning-stroke.—In a large proportion of cases lightning- stroke proves instantly fatal. In non-fatal cases the patient suffers from a profound degree of shock, and there may or may not be any external evidence of injury. In the mildest cases red spots or wheals—closely resembling those of urticaria—may appear on the body, but they usually fade again in the course of twenty-four hours. Sometimes large patches of skin are scorched or stained, the discoloured area showing a markedly arborescent appearance. In other cases the injured skin becomes dry and glazed, resembling parchment. Appearances are occasion- ally met with corresponding to those of a superficial burn pro- duced by heat. The chief difference from ordinary burns is the extreme slowness with which healing takes place. Localised paralysis of groups of muscles, or even of a whole limb, may follow any degree of lightning-stroke. Treatment is mainly directed towards combating the shock, the surface lesions being treated on the same lines as ordinary burns.

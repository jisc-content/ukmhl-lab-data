495 COLLES’ FRACTURE. in the body, and is especially frequent in women beyond middle age. It is almost invariably the result of a fall on the palm of the hand, in the three-quarters pronated position (Fullerton), the force being received on the ball of the thumb, and trans- mitted through the cariras to the lower end of the radius. “ If at the moment of impact the angle be- tween the axis of the forearm and ground is less than 60°, the line representing the direction of the force passes up- wards in front of the axis of the forearm ; the whole shock is therefore borne by the lower end of the radius, which is broken off, and the force being continued, the lower fragment is driven backwards ” (Chiene). The fracture takes place through the cancellated extremity of the bone, within a half to three-quarters of an inch of its Fig. 147.—Colles’ Fracture, iu a mau »t. 30, from a fall on the palm. “Inverted-spoon” deformity well marked.

It is usually transverse, but may be slightly oblique, from above downwards and from without inwards. In a considerable proportion of cases it is impacted, and not infrequently the lower fragment is comminuted, the fracture extending into the radio-carpal joint. When impaction takes place it is usually reciprocal, the dorsal

INHERITED SYPHILIS. 179 I I I but when it persists and is attended with mucous patches in the nostrils, it is very suggestive of syphilis. It usually begins within a month after birth and before the eruptions on the skin appear. When long continued it is liable to interfere with the development of the nasal bones, so that when the child grows up the bridge of the nose is deficient, the condition being known as the “ saddle-nose ” deformity (Fig. 38). Affections of the Skin.—Although all types of skin affection are met with in the inherited disease, the most important is a papular eruption, the papules being of large size, with a smooth shining top and of a reddish-brown colour. It affects chiefly the buttocks and jjosterior aspect of the thighs, the external genitals, and other parts which are constantly moist. It is necessary to distinguish this specific eruption from a form of eczema which frequently occurs in these situations in non-syphilitic children, the’points which char- acterise the syphilitic condition being the in- filtration of the skin and the coppery colour of the eruption.

At the angles of the mouth they often ulcerate and leave fine radiating scars (Fig. 38). Affections of the Mucous Membranes.—The inflammation of the nasal mucous membrane which causes snufHes has already been referred to. There may be mucous patches in the mouth, or a general inflammation or stomatitis which is of special importance because it frequently results in interference with the development of the permanent teeth. The mucous membrane of the larynx may be the seat of mucous patches or of catarrh, and as a result the child’s cry may be hoarse.

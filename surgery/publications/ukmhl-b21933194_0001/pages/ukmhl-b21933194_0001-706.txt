668 DISEASES OF JOINTS. tuberculous, and syphilitic—and from that associated with Charcot’s disease. Fringes and pendunculated, or loose, bodies when added to hydrops give rise to characteristic clinical features, especially in the knee. The fringes, especially when they assume the luxuri- ance of what has been described as the arborescent lipoma, project into the cavity of the joint, and may fill up its recesses and distend its capsule. The joint is swollen and slightly flexed. Pain is not a pro- minent feature, the functions of the joint are but little impaired, and the patient may walk fairly well. On grasping the joint while it is being flexed and extended by the patient, the fringes may be felt moving under the fingers. The patient may first apply for advice on account of the symptoms of loose body. The treatment ap- plicable to this type is the removal of the hypertrophied fringes or of the loose body, by open arthrotomy, and is usually successful. Treatment.—In the absence of definite knowledge of the etiology of the disease, treatment is directed chiefly towards the relief of symp- toms. On no account should the affected joints be kept at rest. Passive movements, exercises of all kinds, massage, electric and hot-air baths, and douching are to be steadily persevered with. When pain is a prominent feature, it may be relieved either by douches of iodine and hot water (tincture of iodine I oz. to the quart), or by the application of lint saturated with a lotion made up of chloral hydrate, gr. v., glycerin 5j., water 5j., and covered with oil- silk. Operative interference by arthrectomy, arthrodesis, or excision is only indicated when the disease is of an aggra- vated type, when it is monarticular, and when the general condition of the patient is otherwise favourable.

PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION. V Foe the present edition the text has been thoroughly revised and some sections have been re-written. Some of the illustra- tions of the former edition have been replaced, and a large number of new illustrations have been added, including a series of micro-photographs of the more important bacteria concerned in surgical diseases, })resented in the form in which they are met with clinically. For the latter we are indebted to Mr. Richard Muir of the Pathological Department of the University of Edinburgh, and for a nundDer of drawings made from specimens in our own possession we have to thank Mr. Evan O. Bowen. There have also been added characteristic examples of X-ray photograidis. Edinburgh, October 1906.

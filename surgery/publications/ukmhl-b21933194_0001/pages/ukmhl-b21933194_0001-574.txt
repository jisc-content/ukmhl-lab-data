536 INJURIES OF PELVIS, HIP-JOINT, AND THIGH. Fractures of the Shaft of the Femur. This group includes all fractures between that immediately below the trochanter minor and the supra-condylar fracture. These fractures are even more common in children than in adults. In adults, when the fracture is due to direct violence, it is usually transverse, and may be' attended with compax’a- tively little displacement. Indirect violence, on the other hand, usually produces complete and oblique fractures, which are frequently comminuted and often compound. The break is most commonly situated a little above the middle of the shaft, the obliquity being downward, forward, and inward, and of such a nature that the fragments tend to override one another (Fig. 185). The direction and nature of the displacement depends more upon the fracturing force, the weight of the lower part of the limb, and the action of the muscles attached to the respective fragments, than upon the direction of the obliquity. As a rule the upper fragment is jjulled forward and outward by the ilio-psoas and glutei muscles, while the lower fragment is dis- placed upward and inward, and is rotated outward by the combined action of the longitudinal muscles, the adductors and the weight of the limb. Clinical Featiwes. — The limb is at once rendered useless, and effusion of blood in the region of with the muiscularity of the part, often renders an accurate diagnosis as to the site and direction of the fracture exceedingly difficult. The shortening varies from half an inch to three or four inches—averaging about one inch in adults—and eversion is always marked. Mobility may be detected and crepitus elicited without disturbing the patient, by Fig. 185. —Longitudinal section of Femur showing Recent Fracture of Shaft with over- riding of Fragments. there is great swelling from the fracture.

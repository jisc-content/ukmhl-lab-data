CHRONIC INFLAMMATION. 49 The treatment of inflammation in special tissues and organs will be considered in the sections devoted to regional surgery. Terminations of Inflammation.—When death results it is usually due to the absorption of excessive doses of bacterial toxins, as in saprpemia and septicaemia. In some cases the in- flamed organ, such as the brain, the lungs, or the kidneys, is so essential to life that the continued interference with its function proves fatal. On the other hand, inflammation may pass off and complete recovery ensue, in which case resolution is said to take place. The removal of the cause is followed by the return of the local circulation to the normal, and the ultimate reabsorption of in- flammatory products. In certain situations, notably in tendon sheaths, the cavities of joints, and the interior of serous cavities—for example, the pleura and peritoneum—the restoration to the normal condition is incomplete, fibrous adhesions forming between the adjacent surfaces of the inflamed structures. Chronic Inflammation.—Chronic inflammatory processes are almost invariably due to the action of the specific virus of such affections as tubercle, syphilis, actinomycosis, or other infective disease, and will be described in the sections dealing with these conditions.

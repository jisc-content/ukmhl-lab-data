486 INJURIES OF ELBOW AND FOREARM. After reduction, the limb is flexed to rather less than a right angle, fixed in a posterior moulded splint, and supj^orted by a sling. Massage and movement are commenced in a day or two, and the splint may be dispensed with at the end of a week. Fracture of the coronoid process predisposes to recurrence of the dislocation; when this complication exists, therefore, the limb should be fixed at an acute angle, and movements jjostponed for a fortnight. Massage, however, may be carried out after the first few days. If there is a fracture of the olecranon process, the treatment must be modified accordingly (p. 478). Comminuted and compound injuries usually call for operative treatment, the fractured bones being wired after reduction of the dislocation, or the loose fragments removed. The forward dislocation is reduced by fully flexing the elbow.

Old-standing Dislocations.—It is seldom possible to reduce by manipulation a dislocation of the elbow which has remained displaced for five or six weeks, especially when it has been complicated by a fracture. The joint surfaces become welded together by adhesions, and separated fragments often form attachments which completely lock the joint. Attempts to break these down are attended with considerable risk of re- fracturing the bone or of tearing soft parts. In such cases it is best to expose the joint and to remove sufficient bone to provide a movable and useful joint. Dislocation of the ulna alone is a rare injury, and is usually associated with fracture of one or other of its processes or of the internal condyle. ^ ^Dislocation of the radius alone, on the other hand, is com-

The Virus of Syphilis.—In the other diseases belonging to the group of infective grauuloinata, the nature of the infective agent has for some time been definitely established, but in the case of syphili.s, it has until quite recently eluded recognition. From time to time various micro-organisms have been observed in syphilitic lesions vrithout, however, there being conclusive proof that they re])resented the true infective agent. The organism, described by Schaudinn and Hoffman in 1905, Fio. 35.—Spiroch*ta palliila. x 1000 diam. Two specimens in centre of iield, surrounded by red blood corpuscles.

The spiro- chteta (Fig. 35) is a delicate thread-like organism presenting several spiral turns and pointed ends; it is markedly mobile, and is stained with difficulty. It varies in length from 4-10 p, and in width measures about "25 /x. It is readily destroyed by heat. No one has as yet succeeded in cultivating it. It may

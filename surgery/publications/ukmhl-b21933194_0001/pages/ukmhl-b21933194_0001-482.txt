444 INJURIES OF SHOULDER AND UPPER ARM. Displacement and crepitus are prevented by the splinting action of the ligaments. When the break is external to the attachment of the trapezoid ligament, the fracture is usually transverse, and is almost always due to a fall on the back of the shoulder—the angle between the spine and the acromion process striking the ground. The outer fragment rotates forward (Fig. 106), sometimes even to a Fig. 106.—Fracture of Outer End of Clavicle. Shows forward rotation of outer fragment, and line of fracture united hy o.sseous callus. right angle, causing the tip of the shoulder to pass forwards, and so to lie slightly nearer the middle line. The integrity of the coraco-clavicular ligaments prevents any marked drooping of the shoulder. It is noteworthy that the displacement is not always evident at first. Fractures of the inntr third are very rare, are usually oblique (Fig. 107), and result either from an indirect force acting in the line of the clavicle, or, less frequently, from direct violence or Fig. 107.—Eecent Fracture of Inner End of Clavicle, seen from liosterior aspect. muscular action. As a rule the deformity is insignificant, except when the costo-clavicular ligament is torn, in which case the inner end of the outer fragment is tilted up by the weight of the arm. The shoulder passes downwards, forwards, and inwards. When close to the sternal end this fracture may simulate a dislocation of the sterno - clavicular joint or a separation of the clavicular epiphysis. This last is a very rare accident, which may occur between the seventeenth and the twenty-fifth years, and is usually the result of violent muscular

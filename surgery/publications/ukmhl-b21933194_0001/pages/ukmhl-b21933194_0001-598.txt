5G0 INJURIES IN REGION OF KNEE AND LEG. we have frequently found the superior tibio-fibular articulation torn open in severe fractures of both bones of the leg. Clinical Features.—The tibial fracture is readily recognised by detecting an irregularity on running the fingers along the crest of the shin, and at this point abnormal mobility, tenderness, and crepitus can usually be elicited (Fig. 204). The condi- tion of the fibula is usu- ally to be inferred by noting the amount of de- formity, and the extent of mobility of the tibial frag- ments. It is often diffi- cult to make out the fibular fracture, and it is not always advisable to attempt to do so, especially if the necessary manipidations cause pain or tend to in- crease the displacement. N ot infrequently the seat of fracture may be recog- nised by detecting a i)oint at which pain is elicited on making pressure over the bone some distance off —pain on distal pressure. On account of the close connection of the skin to the periosteum on the sub- cutaneous aspect of the tibia, the tension caused by extravasated blood is often extreme, and blisters frequently form over the area of ecchymosis. When infected by bacteria these are liable to lead to sloughing of the skin, and the fracture may in this way be rendered compound. The vessels and nerves of the leg are seldom seriously damaged. Treatment.—Reduction is most satisfactorily accomplished umler anmsthesia. Traction is made upon the foot and the fragments are manipulated into position, the pointing of the toes and the outward rotation of the foot being at the same Pig. 202.—Trans- verse Fracture of botli Bones of Leg by direct vio- lence.

Fig. 3.â€”Bacillus coli communis in Pus from abdominal abscess, x 1000 diam. spreading conditions such as phlegmonous or erysipelatous inflammations and suppurations, lymphangitis and suppuration in lymphatic glands, puerperal peritonitis and inflammation of other serous membranes, and inflammations of synovial mem- branes ; also with a form of septic pneumonia which is prone to follow on severe operations in the mouth and throat. Streptococci are also concerned in the production of spreading gangrene and pyaemia. Division takes place in one axis so that chains of varying length are formed (Fig. 2). It is less easily cultivated in artificial PYOGENIC BACTEEIA. 19 inflammation, which soon subsides without showing any tendency to end in suppuration; under other conditions it gives rise to a generalised pyasmia which rapidly proves fatal. The organism has less capacity of liquefying the tis.sues than the staphylococcus, so that pus formation takes place more slowly. At the same time its products are very potent in destroying the tissues in their vicinity, and so interfering with the exudation of leucocytes which would otherwise exercise their protective influence. Strep- tococci invade theEymph spaces, and are associated with acute

THE LYMPHATICS. 316 the latter case resembling chyle. The affection is frequently bilateral, and may be associated with lymph scrotum, with elephantiasis, and with chyluria. The diagnosis is to be made from other swellings in the groin, such as hernia, lipoma, or cystic pouching of the saphena vein. It is aided by obtaining the history that the patient has lived in the tropics, and by finding the embryo of the filarise in the blood. Treatment.—This is influenced by whether the disease is limited to the groin or scrotum, or whether it is generalised through- out the body. Opinion is divided as to the ad- vantages of excision, even in the localised disease. While on the one hand it may bring about a permanent cure, especially if the adult worms are found in the dilated lymphatics which are removed, on the other it may result in the formation of lymphatic sinuses and only afford temporary relief. When the disease is generalised, operation is contra-indicated, and all that can be done is to apply a pad and elastic bandage. Lymphangioma bears the same relation to lymph-vessels as angioma bears to blood-vessels. It consists of cavities and channels filled with lymph, and freely communicating with one another. Their walls are composed of fibro-areolar tissue, lined by endothelium, and sometimes strengthened by non-striped muscle. The cavities result either from the new formation of lymphatic spaces and vessels, or from the dilatation of those which already exist. When the tumour is made up of a mesh- work of caverns and channels, it is called a cavernous lymph- angioma-, when it is composed of one or more separate cysts.

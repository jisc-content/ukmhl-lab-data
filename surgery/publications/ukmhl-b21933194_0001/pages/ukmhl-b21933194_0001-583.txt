DISLOCATIONS OF THE KNEE. 5!5 between the ages of three and nine. The displacement of the epiphysis is almost always forward or lateral, and is accomi)anied by the usual signs of such lesions. The growth of the limb is sometimes arrested, and shortening and angular deformity may result (Fig. 192). Treatment.—After being reduced under an anaesthetic these fractures are usually satisfactorily treated in a box splint (Fig. 205), carried sulhciently high to control the knee-joint. When the head of the tibia is comminuted, light weight-extension—three or four pounds — should bo used. Move- ment and massage are commenced within a few days, and at the end of a fortnight the ]mtient is allowed up with crutches,wearingamoulded splint of poroplastic or plaster-of-Paris. Avulsion of the tubercle of the tibia occasionally occurs iu youths, from violent contraction of the cpiadriceps—as in jumi>- ing. The limb is at once ren- dered powerless, and the osseous nodule can be felt, and on mov- ing it crepitus is elicited. This is best treated by }>eg- ging the tubercle in position, and fixing the limb on an in- clined plane to relax the quad- riceps muscle. The upper end of the fibula is seldom broken alone. Its chief clinical interest lies in the fact that it may ini])licate the external popliteal nerve, and cause drop-foot. Pro. 191.—Separation of Upper Epiphysis of Tibia in a lioy aet. 15.

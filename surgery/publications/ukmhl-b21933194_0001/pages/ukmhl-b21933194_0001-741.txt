Forcil)le movements of the joint under an ansesthetic do more harm than good. Excision of it IS the joint indicated satisfactory results ; otherwise healthy, and who are unable to walk on account of pain and deformity. The general treat- ment of arthritis deformans must also be carried out. Neuro - Arthropathies. — Char- cot’s disease is usually met with in men over thirty who suffer from tabes dorsalis. One or both hip- joints may be affected. Sometimes the development of a fluctuating swelling in the upper part of Scarjra’s triangle indicates the presence of hydrops. In many of the recorded cases, however, attention has first been directed to the disease by the deformity and limp associated with disappear- ance of the head of the femur, or by the occurrence of pathological dislocation. The absence of pain and tenderness is characteristic. When dislocation has occurred, the Fm. has in some cases yielded in young patients who are 268. — Bilateral Charnot’.s Disease of Hip, with dislocation of head of femur on to dorsum ilii. (Dr. H. G. Langwill’s case.) limb is short, and the upper end of the femur is freely movable on the dorsum ilii. When both hips are dislocated (Fig. 268) the atti- tude and gait are similar to those observed in bilateral congenital dislocation. The rotation arc of the great trochanter may be much reduced as a result of the disappearance of the head of the femur. There may be considerable formation of new bone, giving rise to large tumour-like masses in relation to the capsular ligament and the muscles surrounding the joint. The treatment consists in protecting and supporting the joint. When the affection is unilateral, advantage may be derived from a Thomas’ or other form of splint, along with a

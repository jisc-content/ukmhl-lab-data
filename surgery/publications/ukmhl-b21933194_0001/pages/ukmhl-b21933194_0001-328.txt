THE BLOOD-VESSELS. 300 due to such injuries as stabs, punctured wounds, and gun-shot injuries which involve both artery and vein. In former times the most common situation was at the bend of the elbow, the brachial artery having been accidentally punctured in performing phlebotomy of the median basilic vein. Arterio-venous aneurysm is a frequent result of injuries by modern high-velocity bullets. Both in aneurysmal varix and in varicose aneurysm the higher blood pressure in the artery forces arterial blood into the Fig. 67.—Diagram of Aneurysmal Varix.

In aneurysmal varix (Fig. 67) the vein near the point of communication with the artery tends to become dilated, and to form a thick-walled sac, beyond which the vessel and its tribu- taries are distended and tortuous. The free flow of arterial blood through this varicose vessel makes it pulsate, and pro- duces in it a marked vibratory thrill and a loud murmur. In addition to these characters, the clinical features of aneurysmal varix closely resemble those associated with varicose veins. The tendency of the varix is to remain stationary. Rupture is exceedingly rare.

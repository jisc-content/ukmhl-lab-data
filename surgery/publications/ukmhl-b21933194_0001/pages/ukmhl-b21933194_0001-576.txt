538 INJURIES OF PELVIS, HIP-JOINT, AND THIGH. Union is often exceedingly slow in fracture of the femur, and may even be delayed for months. Mal-union sometimes occurs, the fracture uniting with an angular deformity outward and forward. Refracture is very liable to occur if the patient falls or twists the limb within a few months of the original injury. Operative treatment is sometimes called for when simpler measures fail to reduce the dis- placement, and in cases of un-united fracture or of vicious union. The incision, which must be free, is preferably placed in the line of the external intermuscular septum 3 the periosteum is interfered with as little as possible; and the ends of the bones are pegged, screwed, or wired according to circumstances. The after-treat- ment is carried out on the same lines as for simple fracture, but the retentive apparatus must be worn for a considerably longer period. Fracture of the Femur in Children.—In children, especially below the age of ten, this fracture is very common. It is often of the greenstick variety, or, if complete, is transverse and subperiosteal, and as it is accompanied by few symptoms and but little deformity, it is liable to be over- looked. When there is dis- placement the deformity is similar to that in adults, and the treat- ment is carried out on the same lines. In young children the nursing is greatly facilitated by applying vertical extension to both lower extremities (Fig. 187). If the fracture is trans- verse and shows little tendency to di.splacement, the local Gooch splints may be dispensed with, or replaced by a few turns of a starch bandage. The patient may be allowed out of bed in from three to four weeks, wearing a retentive apparatus. Fig. 187.—Fracture of Thigh treated by Vertical Extension.

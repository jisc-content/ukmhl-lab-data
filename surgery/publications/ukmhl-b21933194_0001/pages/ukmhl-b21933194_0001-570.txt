532 INJUEIES OF PELVIS, HIP-JOINT, AND THIGH, is raised, and there is often a degree of lordosis which compensates Fig. 183.—Dislocation of Femur on to Dorsum Ilii, .showing flexion, adduction, and shortening of the limb. for the flexion. The Angers can be pressed more deeply into Scarpa’s triangle on the dislocated than on the normal side—a point in which this injury differs from fracture of the base of the neck of the femur. In a cei’tain number of cases the outer limb of the A-ligament is rup- tured and the limb is everted — dorsal disloca- tion with eversion-, but in other respects the clinical features are much the same. Dislocation into the vicinity of the Ischiatic Notch, or “ dislocation heloiv the tendon.”—This variety of backward dis- location is less common than that on to the dorsum, although produced in the same way. The head of the femur passes beneath the obturator interims, and this tendon, catch- ing on its neck, checks its upward movement (Fig. 184). The clinical features are the same as those of the dorsal variety, but, on the whole, are less marked. Fig. 184.—Dislocation into the vicinity of the Ischiatic Notch.

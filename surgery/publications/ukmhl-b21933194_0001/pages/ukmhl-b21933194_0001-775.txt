737 GENU VAEUM. share in its production than the femur. Although an ungainly deformity, it is much less frequently the source of complaint than knock-knee, because it does not interfere with locomotion —as a matter of fact the subjects of it, although short in stature, are unusually sturdy on their legs. Treatment is carried out on the same lines as in genu valgum. If an operation is required to straighten the limbs, the tibia should be divided below the epi- physis in the first instance. In adolescents it may also be necessary to divide the fibula. If by this the deformity is not corrected, the femur should be divided above the condyles. It may even be necessary to divide the shafts of the tibia and fibula, especially where there is bow-leg as well. This should be performed, however, at a subse- quent operation. Rickety Deformities of the Bones of the Leg—Bow-legs.— These deformities are very common in children under five, and they are nearly always bilateral and symmetrical. They may occur before the child is al)le to walk, the bones bending in the attitude in which they are habitually placed —over the nurse’s knee, for ex- ample, or as they are crossed underneath the child in sitting. In children who are able to walk, the deformity is due to the weight of the body acting on the softened bones. In either case, the bending may be increased by the traction of muscles, and sometimes by the occurrence of green- stick fracture. The most common deformity is a uniform curvature of the bones outwards and somewhat forwards, or a more acute bend in the lower thirds of their shafts (Fig. 289). In some cases the chief curvature is forwards. The imgainli- ness in walking may be added to by flat-foot. The deformity of the legs may be associated with knock-knee or bow-knee. Backward curving of the uj)per end of the tibia has been already described as one of the causes of genu recurvatum. VOL. I—47 Fig. 289.—Bow-leg in Rickety Cliild.

THE HIP-JOINT. 691 the affected limb is adducted. It is of great importance to recognise the cause of this shortening, as it can be corrected by treatment. As a result of the obliquity of the pelvis, the patient, when erect, exhibits a lateral curvature of the spine with the dorso-lumbar convexity to the sound side. When adduction is very pro- nounced, the patient is unable to restore the normal parallelism of the limbs, and the knee on the affected side may cross the sound limb (Fig. 263). There is a deep groove at the junction of the perineum and thigh, there is great prominence of the trochanter, and the pelvis may be tilted to such an extent that the iliac crest touches the lower ribs. As a result of the pressure of the carious articular surfaces against one another, the upper end of the femur is drawn gradu- ally upwards and backwards with- in the socket. Examination will then reveal the existence of a variable amount of actual short- ening ; it will also be found that the trochanter is displaced above Nelaton’s line, while above and behind the trochanter there is a prominent hard swelling corre- sponding to the margin of the enlarged acetabulum. There may, therefore, be a com- bination of real and of apparent shortening amounting together to several inches. In cases of long standing, the shortening is still further added to by deficient growth in length of all the bones of the limb. The most reasonable explanation of the attitudes assumed in hip disease is that given by Kdnig. If the })atient walks without crutches, as he is usually able to do at an early stage of the disease, the attitude of abduction, eversion, and slight Fig. 26.3.—Advanced Tuberculous Disease of Left Hip-joint in a girl cBt. 7, showing flexion, adduction, inversion, and shortening.

Treatment.—In view of the frequency with which sub- cutaneous and mixed mevi disappear spontaneously, active treatment is only called for when the growth of the tumour is out of proportion to that of the child, or when, from its situation —for example, in the vicinity of the eye—any marked increase in its size would render it less amenable to treatment.

In mild cases this condition of affirirs may persist for months; in severe cases destructive changes ensue with remarkable rapidity. The joint becomes enormously .swollen, loses its normal contour, and the ends of the bones become irregularly de - formed (Fig. 252). Some- times, and especially in the knee, the clinical features are those of an enormous hydrops with fibrinous and other loose bodies and hypertrophied fringes—and great oedema of the peri - articular tissues (Fig. 253). The joint is wobbly or flail- like from the stretching and destruction of the controlling ligaments, and is devoid of sen.sation. In other case.s, wearing down and total disappearance of the ends of the bones is the prominent feature, attended with flail-like movements and with coarse grating in the joint. Dislocation is observed chiefly at the hip (Fig. 268), and is rather a gross displacement with exaggerated mobility than a typical dis- location, and it is usually pos.sible to move the bones freely upon one another. An occasional and very striking feature is the extensive development of new bone in the capsular ligament and surrounding mu.scles, resulting in the formation of large masses and plates which may add materially to the already existing deformity. In certain cases the enormous swelling and its ra})id development may suggest the growth of a malignant tumour. The most useful factor in diagnosis is the entire absence of jrain, of tenderness, and of common sensibility.

530 INJURIES OF PELVIS, HIP-JOINT, AND THIGH. It will suffice if we divide them into those in which the head of the femur passes backward, and comes to rest on the dorsum ilii, or in the vicinity of the ischiatic notch; and those in which it passes forward and comes to rest in the obturator foramen, or on the pubes (Fig. 181). The backward are much more common than the forward dis- locations, in contrast to what obtains at the shoulder, where the forward varieties predom- inate. On account of the great strength of the hip-joint, dislocation is by no means a common injury. It occurs most frequently in strong adults after the epiphyses have ossified, and before the bones have commenced to become brittle ; and it is much more common in men than in women. It is invariably the result of severe violence, the limb at the moment being in such a position that the ligaments are on the stretch and the muscles taken at a disadvantage. The head' of the femur usually leaves the joint at the lower and back part, where the socket is shallowest and the liga- ments weakest. The liga- mentum teres is almost always torn from its femoral attachment, and one or more of the muscles inserted in the region of the trochanters may be ruptured. The A-shaped ligament, on the other hand, is seldom torn, and so long as it remains intact the dislocation belongs to one or other of the types above named. All atypical dislocations, such as the supra-cotyloid, infra-cotyloid, ilio-pectineal, are due to rupture of some part of the A-liga- ment, and are so rare as not to call for individual description. Like other dislocations, those of the hip may be complicated by laceration of muscles, blood-vessels, or nerves, or by fracture of one or other of the bones in the vicinity.

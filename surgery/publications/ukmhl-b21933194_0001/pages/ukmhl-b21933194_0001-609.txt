FRACTURES IN THE REGION OF THE ANKLE. 571 inverted and brought up to a right angle by a lew supplementary turns of the Ijandage. In a few days this appliance may be replaced by a poroi)lastic or a Croft’s splint. Mal-union of Pott’s fracture may necessitate an operation to restore the usefulness of the ankle. This consists in dividing the bone by means of an osteotome, forcibly inverting the foot, and then putting the limb up in the same way as a recent frac- ture. The Converse of Pott’s Fracture — sometimes called “Pott’s Fracture with Inversion.” — This injury is fairly common and results from forcible inver- sion of the foot. The external malleolus is broken across its base, or, in young subjects, along the epiphysial line. The internal malleolus alone may be carried away, or a Fig. 213. — Con- ,• t i e portion ot the broad verso 01 Pott si Fracture. Man part of the tibia may set. 37.

When Dufiuytren’s splint is re- quired it is, of course, applied to tlie outer side of the leg. Separation of the lower epiphysis of the tibia is not very common. It occurs most frequently between the age of eleven and eighteen as a result of forcible eversion or inversion of the foot. It is usually accompanied by fracture of the diaphysis of the fibula, and is not infrequently compound. When dis- placed laterally, the deformity is very characteristic (Fig. 214).

FRACTURES OF THE PATELLA. 557 ing tlirough the quadriceps tendon above and the ligainentuin patellae below, keeping as near to the bone as possible. Which- ever method is adopted, the periosteum should be stitched over the fracture, and the tear in the aponeurosis closed with fine catgut sutures. The limb is fixed on a suitable splint. So soon as the wound is healed—in a week or ten days—the splint is removed and massage and movement of the lind) commenced, and the patient may be allowed to move his limb in bed. At the end of another week he may be allowed up with sticks or crutches. When the fracture is caused by direct violence, such as a fall on the knee or the kick of a horse, it may be transverse, oblique, or vertical, but in many cases it is stellate, the bone being broken into several irregular pieces. These comminuted frac- tures are frequently compound. In trans- verse and oblique frac- tures the displacement depends upon the .same causes as in fracture by muscular action. In vertical and stellate fractures, uidess the knee has l)een forcibly Hexed after the bone has been broken, there is little or no displacement. The treatment is governed by the same considerations as in fractures by muscular action. Old-standing Fractures.—x\s fibrous union, even with an interval of several inches between the fragments, is not incom- patible with a useful limb (Fig. 200) it is not often neces.sary to operate for this condition. When the usefulness of the limb is seriously impaired, however, it may be necessary to operate. The operation is carried out on the same lines as that for recent fracture, the ends of the bones being rawed and adhesions divided. When the upper fragment has become attached to the femur it may be necessary to separate it, and it is sometimes Fig. 200.—Old-standing Fracture of Patella with wide separation of fragments. The patient was able to follow his occupation as a dock-labourer.

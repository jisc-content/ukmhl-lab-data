493 FRACTURES OF THE FOREARM. Fracture of the shaft of the ulna alone is also compara- tively rare. It is almost always due to a direct blow sustained while protecting the head from a stroke, or to a fall on the ulnar edge of the forearm, as in going up a stair. The upper third is most frequently broken, and this injury is often associated with dislocation of the head of the radius, or some other injury implicating the elbow-joint. On account of the superficial position of the bone this fracture is frequently compound. The displacement depends on the direction of the force, the fragments being usually driven towards the interosseous space. Tliere is seldom marked deformity unless the head of the radius is dislocated at the same time. The diagnosis is, as a rule, easy. The treatment is the same as for fracture of both bones, but the splints may be dispensed with at the end of a fortnight.

ULCERATION AND ULCERS. 92 the whole thickness of the true skin, excluding the subcutaneous fat (Wolfe-Krause). When the grafts are taken from the ],iuman subject they should be cut oval or spindle shaped, to facilitate the stitching of the edges of the resulting wound. It is to be borne in mind that when separated from the body these portions of skin contract to about two-thirds of their original size, and this shrinkage must be allowed for when it is desired to cover a raw surface with a single graft. These grafts may be placed either on a fresh raw surface or on healthy granulations (Young). It is sometimes an advantage to stitch them in position, especially on the face. The primary dressing and the subsequent treatment are the same as in Thiersch grafting. When successful this method yields most satisfactory results. Skin-grafting from the Lower Animals.—The best re- sults have been obtained by planting the whole thickness of the skin of young warm-blooded animals, such as puppies^ kittens, or rabbits, on a fresh raw surface. The animal is killed with chloroform, the anterior abdominal wall and flanks are shaved, and the skin, after being dissected up free of fat, is cut into j^ieces about two inches by one, and placed on the surface to be covered in. The after-treatment is the same as in Thiersch grafting. The hairs and skin glands are not reproduced. Grafting of Mucous Membrane.—Successful attempts have been made to cover over defects in various mucous membranes, such as the conjunctiva, the cheek, and the urethra, by grafts of mucous membrane taken from man or from the lower animals. The technique is similar to that employed in skin-grafting.

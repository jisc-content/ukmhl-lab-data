DISEASES OF BONE. 624 Chondroma.—Cartilaginous tumours grow from the long bones and from the scapula, ilium, ribs, or jaws. They usually project from the periosteal surface of the bone, and may attain an enormous size; sometimes they grow in the interior of a bone, the so-called enchondronui. The cartilage composing the tumour frequently undergoes myxomatous degeneration, resulting in the formation of a glairy, semi-fluid jelly, and if this change takes place throughout the tumour it forms a cyst. On the other hand, the cartilage may undergo calcification or ossification. The most important transition of all is that into sarcoma the so- called malignant chondroma or chondro-sarcoma, which is associ- ated with more active growth, and parts of the tumour may be carried off in the blood-stream and give rise to secondary growths, especi- ally in the lungs. The innocent chondroma is met with as a slowly growing tumour, which is specially common in the bones of the hand, often in a multiple form (Fig. 236). The surface is smooth or lobulated, and in consistence the tumour may be dense and elastic like normal carti- lage, or present areas of softening, or of bony hardness.

Large tumours growing from the bones of the extremities may implicate the main vessels and nerves (Fig. 237), either simply surrounding them, or pressing on them so as to cause .symptoms. The prognosis varies with the rate of growth; if growing very slowly the probability is that it is innocent; rapid growth is an indication of malignancy. Treatment.—It is necessary to remove the whole tumour. In chrondromata growing from the surface of the bone, especially if they are pedunculated, this is comparatively easy. When an

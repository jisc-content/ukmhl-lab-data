FRACTURES OF SACRUM AND COCCYX. 515 off and displaced downwards by powerful contraction of the sartorius muscle; and the anterior irtferior spine by strong traction on the A-shaped ligament. These injuries are best treated by fixing the displaced fragment in position by pegs or silver-wire sutures and relaxing the muscles acting on it. Fracture of the ischium aloue is rare. It results from a fall on the buttocks, the entire l)one or only the tuberosity being broken. There is little or no displacement, and the diagnosis is made by external manipulation and by examination through the rectum or vagina. A longitudinal fracture of the sacnim may imidicatc the posterior part of the pelvic ring, as has already been mentioned. In rare cases the lower half of the bone is broken transversely from a fall or blow, and the lower fragment is bent forward so that it projects into the pelvis and may press upon or tear the rectum, or the sacral nerves may be dam- aged, and partial paralysis of the lower limbs, bladder, or rectum result. These fractures are frequently comminuted and compound, and the soft parts may be so severely bruised and lacerated that sloughing follows. On rectal examination the lower segment of the bone can be felt, and on manipulating it pain and crepitus may be elicited. Fracture of the coccyx may be due to a direct blow, or may occur during parturition. As a result of this injury the patient may have severe pain on sitting or walking, and during defecation. The loose fragment can u-sually be recognised on rectal examination. There is considerable difficulty iii keeping the fragment in position, and if it projects towards the rectum it should be excised. If the lower fragment unites at an angle so as to cause j)ressure on the i-ectum, it gives rise to the symptoms of coccydynia and may call for excision.

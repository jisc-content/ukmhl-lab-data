GENU VALGUM. 733 of growth is due to the pre.sence of rickets, and its dii’ection is determined by a faulty attitude of the limbs in standing and walking. The legs being aljducted, the weight of the body falls unequally on the outer and inner parts of the ossifying junctions, and inequality of growth results. Pathological Anatomy.—Examination of the femur usually shows that the lower third of thediaphysisof the femur is lengthened on its inner side and shortened on its outer side, and that the epiphysis, itself unaltered, is fitted on to the diaphysis obliquely, so that the in- ternal condyle appears to be increased in length and to occupy a level distinctly below that of the external condyle (Fig. 286). In some cases the tibia shows corresponding alterations. On section of the bones, the epiphysial cartilage and the zone of ossification are found to be thicker, and more irregular than normal —changes which are char- acteristic of rickets. The neck of the femur is shortened and its angle diminished. The bones of the leg are sometimes bent inwards in their lower thirds, and this com - 286.—Drawing of railiogram of case of pensates partly for the Genu Valgum, valgus deformity at the knee. The articular cartilage of the external condyle and the external semilunar cartilage are usually thickened. In pro- nounced cases the quadriceps tendon and the patella are dis- placed outwards. The changes in the soft parts are secondary to those in the bones. It has been shown by Symington that the biceps tendon and ilio-tibial band are shortened and more prominent as a result of the approximation of their attachments, and that they are also displaced outwards.

447 FRACTURES OF THE CLAVICLE. tlie opposite axilla, and round tlie thorax as far as the elbow. It is next looped round the back of the elbow, close al>ove the condyles, and by being carried across the front of the chest to the opposite shoulder pulls the elbow forward and inwards, and so levers the shoulder backward and outward on the fulcrum formed by the loop round the upper arm. The next turn corrects the downward displacement by passing across the back, under the tip of the elbow—a slit being made in the bandage opposite the olecranon process—and along the forearm to the opposite shoulder. A circular l)ody bandage is applied over all these turn.s, and safety-pins inserted at the crossings. ABC Fig. 109.—Attitudes of Limb according to Displacement in Cbiene’s Method. Chiene’s Method.—“In employing this method there are two points to be attended to—the imsition in which the arm is to be kept, and the method of applying the bandage. The more dou'mmrd the displacement, the more vertical must the arm be kept (Fig. 109, A). If the di.splacement is inwardthe upper arm must be placed well across the chest (Fig. 109, B). If forward displacement is most marked, let the upper arm be ])laced as horizontal as possible (Fig. 109, C). “Lay the tail of the bandage on the hand (Fig. 110 (1)); carry it down the back of the forearm, round the elbow, up the upper arm to the tip of the acromion (2), across the back to the opposite axilla, across the forearm (3), round the elliow

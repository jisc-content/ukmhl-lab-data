FRACTURES OF LOWER END OF HUMERUS. 475 three or four years of age. It may occur uj) to the thirteenth or foui’teenth year, but beyond tliat _ age the lesion is usually a combin- ation of separated epiphysis with frac- ture. This lesion is produced by the same forms of violence as cause supra- condylar fracture. If the periosteum is not torn there is little or no dis- placement, but as a rule the clinical features closely resemble those of transverse fracture above the con- dyles, or of dislocation of the elbow. In separation of the ejitphysis there is a peculiar deformity of the posterior aspect of the joint, consisting of two projections—one the olecranon process, and the other the prominent capitel- lum with a scale of cartilage which it carries with it from the external condyle (R.W. Smith and E. H. Bennett). The end of the diaphysis may be palpated through the skin in front. Muffled crepitus can usually be elicited, and there is pain on pressing the segments against one another. Sometimes the separation is compoimd, the diaphysis protruding through the skin. Union takes place more rapidly than in true fracture, but owing to the ex- cessive formation of callus from the torn periosteum in front of the joint, full flexion is often interfered with. If the displaced epiphysis is imperfectly reduced, serious interference with the function of the elbow is lialfle to ensue, and may call for operative interference. Fracture of either Condyle alone.

In either, the size of the fragment varies, but the line of fracture is always partly extra-capsular and partly Fig. 128.—Complete Separ- ation of Lower Epiphysis of Humerus.

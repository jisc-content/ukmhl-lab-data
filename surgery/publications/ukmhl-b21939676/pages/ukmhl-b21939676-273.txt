267 ODONTALGIA. ODONTALGIA. JAMES E. GARRETSON, M. D., D. D. S. The causes of toothache may be classed under the following heads: 1. Sensitive dentine. 2. Exposure of the pulp to sources of irritation. 3. A diseased state of the periodonteum. 4. Confinement of pus and gas in the pulp cavity. 5. Granules of osteo-dentine in the pulp. 6. Sympathy, 7. Recession and absorption of the gum and alveolus. The treatment of these various conditions is briefly as follows : 1. Sensitive dentine. The most permanent means of cure is the introduction of filling into the cavity. As a temporary treatment, the excavation and polishing of the surface may be resorted to. ^ Cauterization with the solid nitrate of silver, chloride of zinc, or with equal parts of the tincture of aconite and a saturated solution of iodine, is preferred by some. A method very satisfactory where the parts are very sensitive consists in introducing into the unexcavated cavity a filling of oxychloride of zinc. 2. Exposure of the pulp. The treatment of an exposed pulp is palliative and radical. Palliative treatment. Foreign bodies are to be removed; the oral fluids, if irritating, changed by appropriate washes ; soothing applications are to be applied, as warm tincture of hamamelis, oil of cloves, dilute creasote, equal parts of chloroform, laudanum, and tincture of aconite, persulphate of iron. In the odontalgia of first dentition, it is well that parents be provided with some gen- eral prescription. A very good one is as follows, to be applied by saturating a small piece of cotton and laying it loosely in the cavity: 313.

In severe inflammation of the pulp, it may be necessary to resort to some more general measures. Blisters upon the nape of the neck will frequently result in speedy relief; hot pediluvia; saline

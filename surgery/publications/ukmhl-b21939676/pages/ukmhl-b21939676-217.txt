CARBUNCLES AND BOILS. 21 I discharge. Usually these strips will be found loosened in twenty- four or forty-eight hours. New ones should then be applied. This mode has been adopted by Prof John Ashhurst, Jr., of Philadelphia, and other American surgeons, and they report that it relieves the patient of pain promptly, and cures in less time than incisions, while it also avoids the risks which accompany the use of the knife. Mr. S. Messenger Bradley, of Manchester, also believes that the cure of boils and carbuncles is expedited, and the â€¢ pain is lessened, by such treatment.

This practitioner observes, in the Medical and Surgical Reporter, March, 1877, that experience seems to have demonstrated that carbuncles do far better without any treatment whatever, than when subjected to deep and extensive incisions.

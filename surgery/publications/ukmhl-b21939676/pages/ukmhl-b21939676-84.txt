THE DRESSING OF WOUNDS. 78 ting care be exercised to mainitain the antiseptic precautions till the sinuses are completely cicatrized. In carrying out his antiseptic method in the treatment of wounds and abscesses, Mr. Lister's chief aims are: first, to exclude all germs of putrefaction; and, secondly, to provide a free escape for all secretions. The first object is attained by cleansing from pu- trefactive germs the part to be operated on, the instruments and sponges employed, and the hands of those that use the instru- ments ; by creating a germless atmosphere during the necessary exposure of the part; and by disinfecting all discharges coming from the part, lest putrefaction should occur in these, and from these spread to the wound itself. The formulae for the various antiseptic preparations of this emi- nent teacher are as follows: Carbolized Oil:— CA R. Acidi carbolici crystalisati, |j Oleilini, f-iiv- Dissolve. Carbolized Putty:— 55. ^. Olei carbolati (above), f-!"J Crets preparatse, ^' To make a firm paste. A7itiseptic Lac Plaster:— 56. I^. Shellac, . |"j Acidi carbolici crystalisati, 3J- Heat the lac, with one-third the acid, over a slow fire ; when completely melted add the remainder, mix, strain and spread. Antiseptic Gauze:— 57. i^. Paraffini, Resinse, ^ gr Acidi carbolici crystalisati, SJ- Melt together. MusUn gauze is dipped in the melted mass, and well wrung or pressed while hot. Antiseptic Adhesive Plaster:— rg R Acidi carbolici crystalisati, 5j ■ Aquse buUientis, f.Svnj. M. Dip ordinary strapping in this, and let it dry.

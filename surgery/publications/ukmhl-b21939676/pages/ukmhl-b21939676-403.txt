397 NASAL DUCT, OBSTRUCTION OF. often have the desired effect. For Dr. Robinfon's plan, see above Compression of the nostrils with the patient's head bent forward, continued some time, will occasionally succeed. On a similar principle a firm ligature around one or both thighs or arms will sometimes check the flow. Transfusion. As a last resort, when deathly exhaustion is imminent, transfusion of blood is not only proper, but demanded. Venesection, once often practiced in this complaint for its derivative effect, is rarely proper. NASAL DUCT, OBSTRUCTION OF. Obstruction and inflammation of the nasal duct, or dakryocys- titis is often due to temporary causes, mere congestion or oedema of the mucous lining being the most common, but plugging with inspissated mucus being also an occasional cause of the obstruc- tion. Such cases may often be relieved by the simplest possible treatment, or get well spontaneously; but if they have remained unrelieved or neglected they may pass into the condition of per- manent obstructions, and these will almost always require treat- ment by the use of instruments. In less obstinate cases much may be done by washing out the lachrymal sac and the duct with stimulating injections, painting the exterior with tincture of iodine to prevent abscess, and the employment by the nostrils of stimulant powders, such as scented snuffs. The obstructions not unfrequently arise from catarrhal, strumous or syphilitic affections of the Schneiderian membrane, to which conditions it is necessary to direct the general treatment. Of injections, one may use: 541. ^. Cupri sulphatis, gr.ij Aquse, *-3J- Or: 542. I^. Zinci sulphatis, f ^â€¢J""-' Aquae, ^^-SJ- When the Schneiderian membrane is thickened and inflamed, Mr. W.

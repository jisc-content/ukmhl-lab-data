206 LESIONS OF MUSCULAR TISSUE. CARBUNCLES AND BOILS (ANTHRAX AND FURUNCULUS). THE ABORTIVE TREATMENT. DR. PETER EADE, OF LONDON, This practitioner, in an article in the British Medical jfoimial, July, 1876, maintains that boils and carbuncles are specific para- sitic diseases ; that in their early stages, they may be infallibly de- stroyed and aborted by destruction of their central stem or root; and that even after this stage has passed, they may generally be de- stroyed, and in all cases, at the very least, greatly modified, by the free application of carbolic acid; and that to produce this result, the acid must be freely introduced into the central portion of the disease, and also into any other part where an opening exists or is formed artificially. The essentials for the proper action of the carbolic acid. Dr. E. conceives to be: 1. The acid must be applied in strojtg solution, 233. I^. Acidi carbolici, f.^ss Glycerinse, f.5j. M. 2. It must be brought into contact with the diseased tissue, for it appears to exert no influence on or through the unbroken skin. To this end, if sufficient openings do not exist when the case is first seen, a proper one must be fearlessly made in the very centre of the disease by some appropriate caustic, and, perhaps, the acid nitrate of mercury effects this better and with less discomfort than any other. 3. The acid solution must be occasionally re-applied to, and into, the hole thus formed, or those already existing. He has found it a good plan to keep a piece of lint wet with a weaker solu- tion constantly over the sore. This abortive treatment of boils and carbuncles has been very highly commended by Dr. Theodore Roth, of Eutin, Germany. The pain is relieved in a few hours, and three or four days effect a cure. A somewhat similar plan is that of M. Joli, who paints thor- oughly the parts with the following:

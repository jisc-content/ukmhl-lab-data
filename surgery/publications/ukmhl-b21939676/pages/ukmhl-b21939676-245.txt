SYNOVITIS. DR. RICHARD O. COWLING, OF KENTUCKY. The safest treatment of sprained ankle is by immobilization. The first thing to be done is to elevate the limb upon a pillow; next to bathe the feet and joint in hot water which will generally be found more effectual than cold. It should be as hot as is at all tolerable to the patient, and should be poured upon the ankle while the foot is still elevated and extended over the foot of the bed. During this affusion, which should be steadily continued for half an hour, the foot and ankle are to be gently stroked upward, increasing the pressure as it can be endured, and the joint moved carefully. It is more than probable that the patient will shrink from this portion of the treatment, but a speedy relief from his pain generally reas- sures him as to its efficiency. Comparative ease having been established by this means, immo- bilization of the joint is best secured by the many-tailed or strip bandage covered by a roller. The strips made of muslin are wet and applied from the roots of the toes to a point eight or nine inches above the ankle. These are covered with a flannel roller carried well up the knee. The patient thus rendered comfortable may be left with direc- tion to take an opiate if he is nervous and sleepless, and to remove the bandage if this from any cause induces or aggravates the pain. After four or five days the bandages may be removed and replaced with a plastic apparatus. SYNOVITIS. MR. RICHARD BARWELL, F. R. C.

This method of using the drug is simple : a syringe with a very fine needle should be used, and care must be taken not to inject into the cavity of the joint, but into the thickness of the morbid

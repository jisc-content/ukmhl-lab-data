SPINA BIFIDA, Should this hope fail, the question arises: Shall we open the abscess, or wait for it to open? On this point, Professor Bill- roth lays down the rule: If the abscess comes from a bone on which an operation is impossible or undesirable (as the vertebrae, sacrum, pelvis, ribs, knee-joint, etc.), do not meddle zviih it, but wait patiently till it opens. All the various methods proposed of open- ino- larg-e cold abscesses—subcutaneous puncture, drainage tubes, caustics, Lister's plans, setons, etc.—are worse than needless, and the surgeon will always regret adopting them. Nothing in any of these methods in the least sanctions the claims made for them by their proposers. In small abscesses originating in disease of the bones of the extremity, it is proper to open freely, as the reaction is insignifi- cant. The wound may then be dressed with stimulating lotions. If the resultant ulcer does not improve under milder remedies, the hot iron may be applied; or the part may be cut; or the whole be extirpated. SPINA BIFIDA. DR. BRAINARD, OF CHICAGO.

Draw off no more serum than the quantity of fluid to be injected. 3. Apply pressure during the operation, so that none of the solution enters the spinal canal. 4. If symptoms of irritation appear, draw off all the contents of the sac, and replace them with distilled water. After, the operation the patient should lie on his side, and if there is much heat, warm evaporating lotions to the part are re-

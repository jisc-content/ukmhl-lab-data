486 NEW GROWTHS. sums up his researches with the positive declaration, that the most maUgnant tumors, such as true cancer, " at a certain stage of their development, can be radically cured by electrolysis, employed according to certain methods." The method he em- ploys is by inserting needles around the mass, and increasmg gradually and slowly the current intensity. The treatment is comparatively painless, and may be applied to cases which are quite far advanced. Little reaction follows it, and with judi- cious after treatment a fair percentage of success may be ex- pected. Dr. Neftel's cases have been published in Virchow's Archives, and elsewhere, and deserve careful consideration. Pressure. (See p. 465.) A recent writer in the Lancet, 1878, remarks that it is obvious if pressure is to be effective it must be applied around the periphery of the growth, where the cell proliferation is most active. This must be obtained, it is said, by the careful adjustment of pads of cotton-wool. The neatest plan would seem to be the employment of compressed sponges, which might be bandaged firmly around a tumor of the breast, and then allowed to swell by imbibition of water. The constriction of the chest would of course be great and thoracic respiration seri- ously interfered with. But the patient might be kept in bed, where abdominal respiration might suffice.

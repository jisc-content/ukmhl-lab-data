After this has been applied for twelve hours the operation is complete, and the healing of the deep excavation alone requires to be attended to. JAMES E. GARRETSON, M. D., D. D. S. This author remarks that in the treatment of schhrhiis of the tongue, the use of caustic remedies is widely employed, and in in- stances recommended by very high authority. His own experience would suggest the following caustic: 688. Zinci chloridi, Aluminis pulveris, Acidi tannici, Ferri persulphatis, Glycerinas, To apply this paste, draw the tongue forward, hold, and dry it well with a napkin. Lay some crystals of zinc on the part, and cover over with the paste. This may be allowed to remain as long as the tongue can be kept dry. Finally, wash the debris away, and the application is completed. If severe glossitis supervene after such an application, it will imply that much more harm than good has been done. In making a caustic impression under such circumstances, the parts should be quickly killed, not excited or provoked. The galvanic cautery is thought by many to be greatly prefera- ble to the potential cauterants. Injection of persulphate of iron is still another means much em- ployed and commended. Dr. Garretson, however, has not found it to answer his expectations. Cancerous epithelioma of the tongue must either be extirpated in the most radical manner, or be soothed into quiet. Section of the lingual nerve and ligation of the lingual artery have been per- formed with the latter view. Where operative means have not been thought advisable, patients have expressed themselves as receiving the greatest relief from the local employment, by means of an atomizer, of the fol- lowing combination: 689. ^.

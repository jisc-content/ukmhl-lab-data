263 VARICOSE VEINS. As to the objections raised against the operation, as, i, that it is Hable to produce extensive ulcers; 2d, that there is danger of phlebitis; 3d, that there is'danger of air in the vein; Dr. Miner states that if the vessel is dissected down upon, with careful touches of the scalpel, until its blue walls are plainly exposed, the point of the syringe carefully introduced into the vessel and no- where else, and if the solution is reduced and not used stronger than above stated, with every precaution as to the perfect cleanli- ness and proper filling of the instrument, not one of these objec- tions can be sustained. Practiced properly, it is invariably successful and satisfactory. DR. ENGLISH, OF VIENNA. This writer, reported in the Mittheilingen of the Vienna Medical College (November 8, 1878), the following method : The vein and a fold of the skin are caught up between the thumb and finger, and a needle of a Pravaz syringe is inserted in such a way that its point shall be immediately behind the vein. The contents of the syringe, from one to one and a half cubic centimetres of a fifty per cent, sample of alcohol, are then discharged in the immediate neighborhood of the vein. A small knot forms at the point of injection, and very often there is a momentary appearance of con- traction in the veins. On the third day, there will be a consider- able infiltration at the point of injection, which differs according to the irritability of different persons. In individuals who were very irritable, there was considerable redness produced, and in four or five cases suppuration ensued. The suppuration was only in the neighborhood oi the vein, however; the vessel itself remained sound and healthy. The abscesses were as large as a bean, but gave rise to no trouble whatever. In none of Dr. E.'s cases was there any rise of temperature, though he examined carefully with reference to this point.

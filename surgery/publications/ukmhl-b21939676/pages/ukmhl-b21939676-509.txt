GENERAL THERAPEUTICS OF SKIN DISEASES. DR. LOUIS A DUHRING, OF PHILADELPHIA.* Both constitutional and local remedies are generally necessary in the treatment of diseases of the skin. Among constitutional measures, much is gained by a well- ordered hygiene, out-door exercise, cleanliness, and often by change of climate. A well-regulated and suitable diet must be looked to. Of medicinal agents, cod-liver oil is especially useful when the general health is run down; the dose should always be liberal, from a teaspoonful to a half ounce or more. The preparations of iron are given with particular benefit in diseases dependent upon chlorosis, and in exudative diseases connected with general im- poverishment, as in certain forms of eczema, psoriasis and the like. Quinine is of particular value in the neuroses (dermatalgia, pruritus,) and in other diseases complicated by a well-defined ner- vous element. Arsenic is the most valuable of all remedies in the treatment of a number of skin diseases, especially in those in- volving the more superficial part of the skin. Its action is slow, weeks and months being required to produce its effects. It should never be given in the acute inflammatory stage of any disease of the skin, nor where there is great heat, burning, intense itching, or rapid cell change. The most desirable form for ordinary use is Fowler's solution. It may also be given in pill form as in the "Asiatic pill," a modified and improved formula of which is: *A Treatise on Diseases of the Skin. Phila., 1877.

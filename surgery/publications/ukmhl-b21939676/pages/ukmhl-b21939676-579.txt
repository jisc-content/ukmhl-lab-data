573 SYPHILIS. When our author employs mercury internally in secondary syphilis, he considers the following a good combination: 951. I^. Pilulae hydrargyri, 5j Extracti opii, gr.v. M. For twenty pills. One of these daily will be as good internal treat- ment as is possible. Iron or quinine may at times be advantageously combined with some of the preparations of mercury, particularly when marked symptoms of anaemia show themselves at the commencement of the secondary period, which is very frequently the case in women. 952. I^. Pilulse hydrargyri, gr.xx Ferri sulphatis exsiccatae, gr.x Extracti opii, gr.v. M. For twenty pills. 953. I^. Hydrargyri cum creta, Quinise sulphatis, aa 9j Extracti opii, gr.iij. M. For ten pills. The special treatment for secondary ulceration of the throat is : 954. I^. Argenti nitratis, gr.xxx-xl Aquae destillatae, f.gj. M. To be freely applied over the velum and back of the pharynx every day, or every other day, while any ulceration or redness continues. The solution may be used with the spray producer. If toward the close of the secondary period sore throat re- appears, as it often does, it then does not yield so rapidly, and it will be necessary to prescribe the following mixture, which will quickly cause it to heal: 955. Vf.. Potassii iodidi, 9ij Potassa; chloratis, Biv Aquse, f.^viij. M. Two tablespoonfuls thrice daily. In the tertiary stage, our author employs iodide of potassium, in doses of from eight to ten grains thrice daily. A salt of ammo- nia added to the solution seems to increase the activity of the iodide thus: 956. I^. Potassii iodidi, Sjy Ammoniae muriatis, 5ij Tincturae cinchonae compositae, f.Â§iv. M. A teaspoonful in a wineglassful of water, thrice daily.

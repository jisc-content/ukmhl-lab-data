IV. THE COMPLICATIONS OF WOUNDS. Erysipelas—Gangrene—Hemoirhage—PJiagedmia—Pyemia—Shock — Tetanus—Traumatic Fever—Traumatic Neuralgia and Paralysis. ERYSIPELAS. MR. T. HOLMES. The depletory treatment of erysipelas is almost abandoned. In the plethoric and strong, after the bowels have been freely opened by a mercurial purge, salines with small doses of antimony, and light fluid diet without stimulants, should be ordered. In the. cellulo-cutaneous form after injuries, the purge should be em- ployed, but an early resort to free stimulation is demanded. WheiD there is much nervous excitement, opium should be carefully ad- ministered ; but as a rule opiates are to be avoided in erysipelas,, except in the phlegmonous form after injuries. Camphor, ammo- nia and light tonics, generally act beneficially after the bowels, have been regulated. The free exhibition of the tincture of the perchlo'ride of iron is very beneficial in many cases; gtt. xv-xx every three hours must be given in order to produce its specific- effect ; and it will not agree if the tongue is foul, and the general, fever is rising. Salines with small doses of antimony should be prescribed in that condition, and the iron resumed subsequently. Locally, the exclusion of the air from the inflamed surface is very grateful. An ointment of calamine or of lead may be used for this purpose ; or the part is defended by a layer of cotton wool, or some bland warm lotion is used, as dilute solution of the sub- acetate of lead with opium, or a solution of the sulphate of iron. 92.

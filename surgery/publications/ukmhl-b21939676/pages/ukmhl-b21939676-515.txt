GENERAL THERAPEUTICS OF SKIN DISEASES. The dose of arsenic, small at first, is to be increased slowly until some of its physiological effects are manifested, or the disease yields ; it may then be sbmewhat diminished. It is very important that arsenic be taken very regularly and persistently, and always under the supervision and frequent inspec- tion of the physician. Frequently.arsenious acid is better tolerated when combined with opium, as: 735. I^. Acidi arseniosi, gr.j Pulveris opii, gr.iv. M. Make sixteen pills.

He remarks that there are few medicines less likely to do harm than arsenic when administered

viii editor's preface. Resumes are the result of a careful collation of many authorities; and the labor of selection from the mass of material at hand has not been a light one. These features give the book a claim to being considerably more than a compilation, and will be found to enhance greatly its value as a practical hand book of Surgical Therapeutics, designed to be of daily assistance to him whose business is to treat disease and repair injuries in the human body. The work grew out of the author's " Modern Therapeutics," and is an amplification of the Surgical portion of that work. It is, therefore, in some sense, a companion volume to Napheys' " Modern Medical Therapeutics." To forestall certain criticisms which may be made, it should be stated that it was no part of the author's plan to reconcile conflict- ing instructions as to treatment, coming from sources of equal weight. It was deemed more consonant with the purpose of this volume to state fully and fairly such contradictory instructions, in order to prevent the reader attaching too much weight to one or another authority.. Thus, he will be taught a salutary distrust of mere authority, a greater independence of action, and a higher regard for the value of his own experience. All the received text- books of surgery are written by men earnestly advocating their own particular views ; this is well, but it is equally well that there should be a book, also, in which these varying views are set forth without the effort to exalt one or depreciate another. It may be added that while the object of this work is largely to give the exact prescriptions and minute directions of surgeons, it is not supposed that any reader will slavishly follow these, but only that they will serve as faithful portraitures of therapeutical prac- tice, to be modified or adapted to the exigencies of individual cases. ,

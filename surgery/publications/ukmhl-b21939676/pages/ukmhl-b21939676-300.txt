Parenchymatous injections of ergotin have been used, with moderate success. Fel bovinum, ox-gall, applied locally, is said to have a remarkably prompt effect in dissipating tonsillar enlargements. ^ HERNIA. The therapeutics of hernia is confined to those measures which are auxiliaries to the taxis, and those by which an operative pro- cedure may be avoided. They may be considered under the fol- lowing headings: AncBsthctics. These are considered indispensable as relaxants in preparing for the taxis. Chloroform is generally preferred. It should be given to the extent of complete obliviousness. Aspiration. Several French and some English surgeons very earnestly advocate the employment of aspiration in all cases of irreducible strangulated hernia. It is quite safe, whereas the ordi- nary operation shows a mortality of from 25 to 45 per cent. With such facts as these before us, it becomes a very serious question indeed, whether any surgeon is warranted as a rule in performing the old operation for hernia, before having tried the simpler and safer plan of aspiration. The one, if not sufficient, does not pre- clude the use of the other. The safety with which the aspirator can be used would encourage us to resort to early operative inter-

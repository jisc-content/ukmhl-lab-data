(V) PREFACE TO THE SIXTH EDITION. The preface to the previous edition (which has been retained in the present one) sufficiently explains the plan of the present work. Its value as a hand-book of Therapeutics is abundantly proven by the fact that a large edition has been exhausted in a year. In presenting it again to the public, all parts have undergone a careful reading; the monographs and treatises of the last year have been consulted; various important pharmaceutical novelties have been introduced as promising to be of value; and some thirty or forty pages have been added to the text; a certain number of omissions have been made; so that about one-sixth the book is new matter. No pains have been spared to render it worthy of the very favorable reception which has been accorded it. The edition is called the sixth so as to make it synchronous with the sixth edition of Napheys' Medical Therapeutics, as it is a development of the Surgical part of that work; as a separate volume, it is in its second edition.

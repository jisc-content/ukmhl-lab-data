To be divided into five injections. One to be thrown up the rectum three times daily. PROF. VON LANGENBECK, OF BERLIN. This eminent surgeon states that he has treated prolapsus ani " with astonishing success" by hypodermic injections of a solution of ergotin (five to fifteen parts to one hundred of distilled water). He replaces the bowel, and inserting the point of the syringe about three centimetres in depth in the cellular tissue, throws in from one to two grains of ergotin. This should be repeated every three or four days for three or four weeks, any hard fecal masses in the bowels being first removed by a simple injection. Much may be done in prolapsed anus by mechanical measures, as wearing a pad and T bandage; by using an air-dilated gum- elastic pessary; by avoiding low stools and straining during defe- cation, etc. Prof Stromeyer says many cases may be relieved by warm baths and moderate doses of magnesia.

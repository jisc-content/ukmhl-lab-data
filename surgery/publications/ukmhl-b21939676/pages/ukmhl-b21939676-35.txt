29 THE IMMEDIATE TREATMENT OF INFLAMMATION. 11. Vini antimon., ""Ixx Tincturas hyoscyami, f.3ss Liquoris ammon. acetatis, f.Â§j. M. This amount every six hours.

To be given three or four times a day. As this intermediate condition disappears, actual convalescence should be established. This, however, is frequently retarded by impaired functional activity and loss of tone. The food does not seem to benefit the patient, and there is torpor of the alimentary

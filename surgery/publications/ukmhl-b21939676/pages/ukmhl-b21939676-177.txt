HYDROPHOBIA. ^7^ Uvdrarovmrn Chloridim Mite. Mr. McReddie; reports a cure by calo- Hydn^r^'^-^^l Another cure is reported m the from drachm doses of calomel. It is reported by Dr. Ligget. Another cure by the same means is recorded m the Lancet, vol. vi Hm, Ai/erican edition. This combination of authorities Sverfair grounds for the belief that in some instances mercur- fals are really efficacious, and should encourage their further use. TaborandL As the poison appears to pass out of the system by the sah- jaboranai. ^^^^i^ ^^^.^ ^^^^^^^^ sialagogue is suggested. Oxygen. Inhalations of oxygen have been found relieve gre^^^^^^ cyanosis and spasms. Dr. Laschkewitsch (Gazette Medicate Paris 1872 No. L.) has administered inhalations of oxygen to a peasant, who, ten weeks before, had been bitten by a mad wolf The tetanic muscular contractions ceased, the cyanosis disaDDeared and the exacerbations of violence gave place to a tfergentle condition. Notwithstanding t^-Jatal result (due probably to the inattention of the nurses, who discontmued the oxygen inhalations), the author recommends the use ot this agent to the attention of the profession. Pepsina, if applied immediately to the wound, is said to have the power o^ neutraUzing the poison of rabies (Dr. A. V. J^orgey, »^iuu. Lancet, June, 1878). Scutellaria has a popular reputation deserving of some consideration. Woorara In the American Journal of the Medical Sciences, July, 1876, Dr B A. Watson, of Jersey City, N. J., reports a case by hy- podermic injections of strychnia and woorara, a method which in other hands has failed. But generally the dose used has been too small. From % grain should be exhibited hypo- dermically every three hours, to have any positive effect. i he following formula is proposed by Mr. Moss as best meeting the requirements of the case : HYPODERMIC INJECTION OF CURARA. 166. R. Curara, g^'.-J .. Water, min. xij. Dissolve ; let the solution stand forty-eight hours and filter. Using this solution two thirds, a half, third, or quarter of a grain may be given in a whole number of minims. Of the other strengths likely to suggest themselves, viz., one in ten, and one in fifteen, the first would only allow of a tenth, and a half a grain; and the second, of a fifteenth, a third, and two- thirds of a grain being given in the same way. The accounts of the use of curara seen to indicate that the dose is from a quarter to half a grain. Caution —Curara requires to be handled with the utmost care. It should not be allowed to come into contact with a fresh cut or scratch. Two good rules would be—never to powder it in the dry condition, and never * to touch it with the naked fingers.

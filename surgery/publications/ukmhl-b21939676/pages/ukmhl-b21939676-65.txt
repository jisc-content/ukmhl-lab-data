Saturate lint, apply to the part, and cover with lint or spongio-piline, wrung out of warm water. ETHER. The local application of ether spray was proposed by Dr. Benj. Richardson, and has at times been popular. The fluid should be rectified, perfectly neutral, sulphuric ether, and held at a dis- tance of two inches from the part to be affected. Dr. Letamendi in the Archives de Physiologic, Nov., 1875, adds the following directions: After about two minutes the part of the skin on which the spray has fallen becomes red, and is the seat of a disagreeable sensation of cold : there is no sensation of burning in the part. If, at this moment, an incision, eight or ten millimetres long, is made with a convex bistoury in the centre of the reddened part, not being carried deeper than the papillary layer of the cutis, im mediately the incision is made, there is suddenly produced an anaemic zone, which enlarges outward from the point incised, as a circle goes on enlarging on the surface of water into which a peb- ble has been dropped. If the spray is again directed for a few seconds on the part which has thus become anaemic, the region becomes perfectly bloodless and completely anaesthetic. The tissues when cut are like frozen fat, and have lost their elasticity. Around the white circle there is a zone in which the anaemia is not absolute. The spray di- rected on this zone speedily makes the anaemia and consequent anaesthesia complete. The anaesthesia can thus be carried around or along a limb. Another plan of using ether is the following : 50. Pulveris camphorae, Etheris sulphurici. 5iv §j. Dissolve.

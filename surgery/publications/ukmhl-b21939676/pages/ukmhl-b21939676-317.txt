HEMORRHOIDS (piLEs). 311 In most cases of recent origin, the above means will effect a cure, and prudent living will obviate a return. DR. ROCHARD, OF PARIS. This practitioner is of opinion that surgical interference should be more and more restrained in hemorrhoids. Very often simple hygienic treatment, conjoined with a suitable regimen, relieves the*se patients of their infirmities. He has cured a considerable number of such persons by simply advising them to go to stool only in the evening before going to bed, after a cold enema for the purpose of facilitating defecation.

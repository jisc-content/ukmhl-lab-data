M. SPERMATORRHEA. HYGIENIC MEASURES. All authors agree that in this complaint the medical treatment must be actively supported by proper hygienic measures to insure any degree of success. H\\&food should be generous and nutritive, easily digested, but plain. Highly spiced dishes, tea, coffee and most stimulants should be avoided; especially at and after supper. Very little fluid should be taken at tea and none after, as the filling of the bladder strongly predisposes to emissions. Tobacco and opium must not be used in any form. The patient should sleep in a cool, well ventilated room, on a hard bed by himself, with but light bed covering, and avoid sleep- ing on his back by tying a towel around the waist with a knot over the spine. He should sedulously avoid every form of vene- real excitement, whether social, by reading, thought, or conversa- tion. Every morning he should sponge the parts in cold water, or, what is better, take a cold sitz-bath. This should not be taken before retiring, as the reaction brings an access of blood to the part and predisjDoses to emissions. Cold water enemata are often very salutary.

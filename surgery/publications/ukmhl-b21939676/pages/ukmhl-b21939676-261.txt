NvEVUS. Internally, in such cases, the sulphites and sulphurous acids (also the sulpho-carbolates) have been recommended. These sub- stances are yet under trial, but may properly be exhibited experi- mentally. If red lines have begun to stretch up the limb, Prof. Agnew recommends that it should be encircled ,by a blister, above the disease, which, if timely applied, will stay the further progress of this inflammation. N/EVUS. In the cure of naevus, the means at our disposal may be divided into two classes : first, those by which a scar is avoided; and sec- ondly, those which necessarily leave a cicatrix of greater or less magnitude. The first class aim at the destruction of the texture of the nsevus, or the coagulation of the blood which it contains, by agents which can be introduced through minute punctures of the skin. The means used are the injection of coagulating fluids, the introduction of setons, the subcutaneous ligature, electrolysis, and the galvanic cautery. Electrolysis, the other method referred to, may be performed in two ways, viz., with and without insulation of the electrodes. With perseverance, the latter is an efficient means, but local injections are much more convenient. Dr. BiGELOW, of Boston, uses: 298. I^. Argent! nitratis, Aquse destillatse, aa gtt.iij-vj. M. For injection. Dr. De Smet, of Brussels, has found that small nasvi may often be dispersed by tattooing with Croton oil. Dr. Henry G. Piffard, of New York, expresses the opinion that in the capillary naevus, or " wine-mark," probably the best method of treatment is to paint lightly the surface, or part of it, if large, with nitric acid. When the cauterized epidermis exfoli- ates, the nsevus should be found to have slightly diminished. The application can then be repeated. It should be done by means of a small probe, around the end of which a little cotton has been wrapped.

CYSTITIS, 1878), reports very favorably of this method. He gives the fol- lowing prescription : 420. I^.

The above in addition to the skimmed milk, has invariably been successful in a comparatively brief period of time. PROFESSOR EDLEFSEN. This writer (in the Deutsches Archiv fur Klinisc^te Medicin, Dec, 1876,) teaches that in cystitis an instrument should never be intro- duced into the bladder unless absolutely necessary. Few cases, he believes, will resist the proper administration of copaiba and oil of turpentine. Of the latter, he gives TTLx at a dose. He also highly extols chlorate of potash. 421. 'Sf.. Potassae chloratis, Â§ss Aqus, Oj. M. A tablespoonful every two or three hours. Syrups and sweets should never be added. Prof. Edlefsen first employed chlorate of potash in cases where turpentine failed or was contra-indicated, and was surprised at the rapid cures ef- fected. In one case which had lasted two years, and in which tur- pentine did no good, after employing potass, chlor., for eight days, there was hardly any sediment in the urine, and it was quite acid. On the other hand, some cases which did not improve under potass, chlor, were cured by oil of turpentine. He thinks this remedy will supply a place long vacant, and hopes practitioners will fully test it. When chlorate of potash is used, as a rule the pus in the urine rapidly diminishes, the subjective symptoms dis- appear, or are mitigated, and the acid reaction of the urine re- turns, but not so rapidly as after the employment of oil of tur- pentine.

In most cases of this complaint, ac- cording to this author, hot poultices upon the abdomen and gene- ral warm baths, suffice to relieve the symptoms and to bring about a favorable termination. The patient should drink Seltzer, Wil-

THE TREATMENT OF SCROFULA. 489 Cod-liver oil, though not infrequently prescribed indiscrimin- ately, and where it does no good, is especially valuable where there is a decided tendency to emaciation. The dose is f.§ss, thrice daily, in good ale or along with a little brandy. Its use must be continued steadily and persistently for a long time. Whatever remedies are employed, the closest attention should always be paid to maintaining the bowels regular and active; to providing the patient with a light and nutritious diet; moderate and regular exercise in the open air; and warm and comfortable clothing.

A teaspoonful four times a day for a child four years old. Should the bowels remain constipated, the quantity of the senna may be increased. It acts on the liver, and exerts a decidedly beneficial effect on the general disease. When this has been con- *Lectures on Practical Surgery. Phila., 1877.

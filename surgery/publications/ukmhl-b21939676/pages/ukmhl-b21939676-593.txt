WOODBURY, PHILADELPHIA. This writer condemns (^Medical Times, October, 1875,) the cus- tom of opening buboes by free incisions. It is sufficient to pass a narrow-bladed bistoury through the gland, and then inject a drachm of diluted tincture of iodine (one part to four of water). In some cases the use of the knife can be altogether avoided by the following treatment: The patient is confined to his bed ; a half-brick, covered with flannel—a single thickness—is laid upon the bubo. A lump of ice is kept upon the brick, and as it melts, the flannel is saturated with ice-water. He has seen a large bubo disappear in twenty-four hours under this treatment by cold and pressure; a combination of iodine and iodide of potassium in syrup of sarsaparilla being administei-ed internally. If this course be resorted to at the proper time, the necessity for surgical interference will often be avoided If the knife be used, the smaller the incision, the better and more rapid the cure.

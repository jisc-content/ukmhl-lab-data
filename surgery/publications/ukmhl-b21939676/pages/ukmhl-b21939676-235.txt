D., PHILADELPHIA. For the radical cure of this troublesome affection, excision of the sac has been resorted to, but this operation is liable to be fol- lowed by erysipelas, and is dangerous. A much safer plan is to divide the sac subcutaneously with a delicate tenotome, cutting it up into numerous fragments, and then penciling the surface of the swelling several times a day with tincture of iodine. This method our author has practiced in numerous cases with gratifying results. DR. CHARLES H. LOTHROP, OF IOWA. This writer tried a variety of apparatus, Bigg's, Erichsen's, etc., without benefit, but is satisfied that the following will be found successful. Displacement of the toe is the obstacle to be over- come. A large and wide boot, shoe or slipper must be worn, made of cloth or other light material. A cot, made of muslin or some other firm and soft fabric, is placed upon the great toe of the aftected foot. One or more strips of adhesive plaster are placed on and around the heel, their free extremities extending toward the free end of the cot upon the toe. The ends of the plaster and cot are then connected by means of a strong rubber ribbon, so that there is a constant traction of the toe to return to its natural position. If necessary, other strips of plaster should be applied to retain the apparatus in position, one about the instep, and one about the ball of the foot; while another may be bound about the great toe and attached to the second. The contractile power of the external ligament and abductor poUicis is thus overcome without injury. If they do not readily yield, they should be partially divided by tenotomy. There is no

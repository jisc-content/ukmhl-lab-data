460 NEW GROWTHS. Dr. John Bartlett, {Chicago ' Medical Examiner^ Aug., 1872,) employs it as follows : 668. Teucrii mar. folior., Alcohol, f,gx. M. Macerate fourteen days. Apply locally to the polypus, and also take a few minims inter- nally daily. This writer reports several cases of aural polypi, one being himself, who have been cured by this remedy. Dr. W. W. Seely, of Cincinnati, Ohio {Transactions Ohio State Medical Society, 1872), states that in aural polypus, where evulsion is not employed, he adopts this plan: After thoroughly drying the ear, cleansed of all discharge, he applies on the point of a small probe a minute crystal of chromic acid, seldom larger than an or- dinary pin's head. If the polypus is large, and he finds he only has made a small impression, he applies it again the next day, and then waits three or four days, when usually a white mass of charred tissue will drop off. Another application then takes place. Great care is necessary in using the chromic acid, but with such care it is free from danger. WARTS AND CORNS. In treating a wart, chromic acid is a useful agent. In many in- stances it will blacken and kill the growth, the tumor sloughing away in the course of five or six days, leaving the resulting ulcer a perfectly simple one. But this cauterant is not to be applied to the vascular kind of wart; on the contrary, if irritable, as it often is when brought to the notice of the practitioner, it should be soothed by gentle appli- cations, after which it should be thoroughly removed by the knife or ligature. Especially when situated on the face, a wart cannot be too judiciously or carefully treated. Professor Syme preferred to soften a corn by touching it again and again with acetic acid until the whole is scraped out, and then to apply nitrate of silver to the exposed surface of the cutis, so as to destroy its morbid secretory tendency. For soft corns, he recommended astringent applications, such as

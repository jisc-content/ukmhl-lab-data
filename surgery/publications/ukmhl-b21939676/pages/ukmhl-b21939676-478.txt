NEW GROWTHS, 472 project above the surface, as in tumors of the breast and the like. The arrows are introduced around the tumors at the distance of one-third to one-half an inch from one another, and the tumor is effectually destroyed in one hour, or two at most. By this method very little of the healthy tissue is destroyed, scarcely any blood is lost, and there is very little reaction. " 2. Cauterization in parallel lines. In this method the caustic is introduced in parallel lines, so as to divide the substance to be de- stroyed into thin laminae, which yield promptly to the destructive properties of the agent. This method has been found most use- ful in tumors that are deep-seated—as in the neck, the rectum, the uterus, etc. "3. Central cauterization. In this method an opening is m.ade with a scalpel carried through the middle of the tumor, and the arrows are pressed into this until they are completely buried in the tissues. This method is less energetic than either of the others, but is useful in superficial tumors. The chief advantages claimed for cauterization by Maisonneuve are its powers of preventing pur- ulent infection, erysipelas, surgical fever, hemorrhage (it is a pow- erful haemostatic), and other dangerous contingencies of surgical operations. DR. J. W. BRIGHT, OF KENTUCKY.* This author, who clainis to have had a long and successful ex- perience in the treatment of cancers, depends almost exclusively on certain preparations of the chloride of zinc. These are four in number, as follows: 682. I^. Extract! podophylli radicis, Zinci chloridi, Amyli, Santali pulveris, Aquae, Make a thick paste. The object of the starch is to give tenacity to the paste, and the red sanders to porosity, so that the full effect of the active constituents may be felt by the sore. 683. I^.

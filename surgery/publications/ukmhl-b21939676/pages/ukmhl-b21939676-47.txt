GENERAL ANESTHETICS. ALCOHOL, The vapor of heated alcohol was used to induce anaesthesia in surgical operations before the discovery of ether or chloroform. The insensibility of the drunkard also suggested its internal use for the same purpose. Of recent years it has been extensively employed by Prof John Lynk, M. D., of Cincinnati. He depends upon it almost entirely in his surgical operations, believing that it leaves the functions, es- pecially those of the heart, in a more normal condition than chlo- roform. He advises the patient to drink freely of whisky, in the case of a robust male to the amount of about a pint. Very little chloroform is then needed, or, in minor operations, none at all. {Cincinnati Lancet and Observer, May, 1876.) Although it is probable that this method will not receive the general sanction of surgeons, the value of a small amount of alco- hol taken shortly before the inhalation of chloroform or ether can- not be denied, and should generally be remembered and acted on. bonwill's method. This method is named after its discoverer, W. G. A. Bonwill, D. D. S., of Philadelphia. The anaesthesia is produced by rapid breathing of ordinary atmospheric air. To produce the proper effect, the patient must open the mouth, C41)

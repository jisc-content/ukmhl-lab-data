90 THE DRESSING OF WOUNDS. unfit for general use, as no one'can resist a constant tendency to sneeze while exposed to it. He has obtained a great number of completely successful results with salicylic acid alone, and does not hesitate to use it by itself in many casesâ€”for instance, ir!*the- treatment of burns. The salicylic dressing he has found most convenient is that re- commended by Thiersch, made by saturating jute with the acid 3 per cent, by weight, adding a little glycerine, 45-ft>., which pre- vents the drying of the jute. He thinks great advantage attaches to the moist condition of the dressing; it is ready to absorb moisture, and if air be drawn through it, as in wounds affected by respiration, the moist threads serve, he is confident, as better filters than dry ones would. The advantage of addition of glycerine, ac- cording to Thiersch, is that it prevents the dry acid from flying off in dust from the jute. Nothing can be easier made or more readily applied than the jute dressing. He applies it beneath a few folds, generally three, of gauze, containing sheet gutta-percha, directly on the wound, except in cases where the support of a bandage is required directly on the flaps, etc. This mode of application made under the car- bolic spray combines both acids, and the application of the jute next the wound prevents the irritation often felt from the gauze rubbing the skin. RESUME OF REMEDIES. Alcohol, as an efficient antizymotic and stimulant, has been largely used as a dressing (see above, p. 73)'- Most of the tinctures used as vulneraries owe their value to the alcohol they contain. A formula much used by Prof. Joseph Pancoast, of Phila- delphia, is : 83. I^. Castile soap, 3j Bicarb, potass., 3iJ Alcohol, Apply with pledgets of lint. M. Alumen, in the following formula, is used by Professor Lister as an ap- plication to ill-smelling and pustulating wounds : ss 84. IJc. Aluminis, g. Plumbi acetatis, 5J. Aquse, ^J- For a lotion.

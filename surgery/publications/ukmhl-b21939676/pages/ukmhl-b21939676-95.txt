Used as a " germ-proof" dressing. Carbolated earth is made by adding two parts of crude carbolic acid to ICQ parts of dry, sifted earth. M. MAGNIS-LAHENS, OF TOULOUSE, Adds charcoal to coal-tar (33 per cent, of the latter), and thus ob- tains a light and porous powder, which does not irritate wounds, and which is easily washed off with cold water. This combination is a very useful mixture of two antiseptic substances. The char- coal absorbs the gases formed by fermentation, coagulates the al- bumen, and prevents its decomposition; thus effectually assisting the carbolic acid contained in the coal-tar. PROFESSOR E. H. BENNETT, OF DUBLIN. This surgeon urges the advantages of a combination of carbolic and salicylic acids in dressings. {Medical Press and Circidar, March, 1876.) His experience has been that the salicylic acid dressings do not exert so marked an influence in controlling suppuration as carbolic acid, which is in a great measure due to the fact that it is non-vola- tile, and so does not penetrate the depth of wounds. It wants, too, the advantages that arise from the stimulating action of the car- bolic acid, and so wounds progress rather more slowly under its action. The spray of salicylic acid, though entirely odorless, is quite

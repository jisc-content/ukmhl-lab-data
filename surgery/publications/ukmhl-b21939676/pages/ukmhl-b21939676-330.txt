XI. LESIONS OF THE ORGANS OF URINATION. (324) Cystitis {Acute and Chronic)—Enuresis {bicontinence of Urine)— Initable Bladder [Dysuria, Strangury)—Lithiasis {Stone, Calculous Disease, Gravel)—Prostatic Diseases. CYSTITIS. PROFESSOR GEORGE JOHNSON, F. R. S., LONDON. The value of an exclusive milk diet in cystitis has recently been spoken of by this writer {Lancet, Dec, 1876). In acute cases and in many chronic cases this brings prompt relief to the symp- toms, and in a short time, a cure. The urine is largely diluted, and rendered mild and unirritating, and thus the coats of the bladder revert to their normal condition. The milk may be ta n cold or tepid, and not more than a pint at a time, lest a large mass of curd, difficult of digestion, form and collect in the stomach. Some adults will take as much as a gallon in the twenty-four hours. With some persons the milk is found to agree better after it has been boiled, and then taken either cold or tepid. If the milk be rich in cream, and if the cream disagree, causing heartburn, headache, diarrhoea, or other symptoms of dyspepsia, the cream may be partially removed by skimming. One reason amongst others for giving the milk, as 'a rule, unskimmed—that is, with the cream,—is that constipation, which is one of the most frequent and troublesome results of an exclusively milk diet, is to some extent obviated by the cream in the unskimmed milk. As a rule, it is unnecessary, and, therefore, undesirable, to add bread or any other form of farinaceous food to the milk, which in itself contains all the elements required for the nutrition of the body. When the vesical irritation and catarrh have passed away, and the urine has regained its natural character, solid food may be com- bi-ned with the milk, cftid thus a gradual return may be made to the ordinary diet, while the effect upon the urine and the bladder is carefully watched.

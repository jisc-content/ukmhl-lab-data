If any points re- main of less satisfactory appearance, or still presenting cancerous alterations, a little of the caustic paste is again to be applied. Internally he believed it best, though not in all cases indispens- able, to administer the chloride of bromine internally in doses of iV or of a drop, in pill form twice a day, for from three to six months.

EARTH DRESSINGS ANTISEPTIC DRESSINGS. 75 EARTH DRESSINGS. The introduction of earth dressings in modern surgery is due to Dr. Addinell Hewson, of Philadelphia.

When the surface is thus prepared, a number of grafts are inserted, and the whole covered by clay in the following manner: The dry clay is mixed up with olive oil to the consistence of a paste, and applied twice a day.

Very different methods and agents have been resorted to for this purpose, the best known of which are those advocated by

VARICOCELE. 39 ^ wards' attached to the suspending belt. The application is easi^ly made by the patient in the morning before rising and when the parts are relaxed, laying the affected organ, while m the dependent position, in the "suspender," and lacing up the hooks with a mod- erate degree of tightness, then raising it up and attachmg the tapes to the suspending belt previous to rising from bed. The size 6f the "suspender" must, of course, vary more or less, but the measurements named will suit an ordinary case; the lead wire encircling the lower end gives a foundation to the general means of support, and keeps the testis within the suspending bag; the patient can mould it more or less to his convemence. Of course, as in every appliance of the kind, a certain amount of dis- cretion must be used as to wearing the suspender; for the first few days it should not be kept on constantly ; the parts should be sponged night and morning with cold water or a cold lotion used so as to fortify the skin, as any chafing must be avoided. In all cases the suspender is best omitted at night. Dr Edward R. Mayer states that he has obtained the most sat- isfactory results in cases of varicocele by applying lotions of tinct- ure of hamamelis virgmica, diluted with water.

LESIONS OF THE ORGANS OF URINATION, 334 ENURESIS. INCONTINENCE OF URINE. DR. WILLIAM A, HAMMOND, OF N. Y. This author states (in the Ohio Medical mid Surgical Journal, October, 1876,) that he has found the following plan of treatment so efficacious that, though there are others which are at times fol- , lowed by success, he has for several years past adopted it exclu- sively : (1) Supposing the patient, as is generally the case, to be a child, the bladder should be emptied on going to bed, and then two or three times afterwards the patient should be taken up and again made to urinate, (2) Sleeping on the back should be prevented. The supine position is one which, of all others, increases the amount of blood in the cord, and hence augments its irritability, (3) The follow prescription should be given for several months, three or four at least; if stopped sooner, the affection is liable to return: 448.

Thus for the first month ten drops are taken three times a day; for the second month, fifteen drops three times a day; for the third, twenty drops, and so on. It is preferably administered after meals, being less apt then to excite nausea or vomiting. Should either of those symptoms prove troublesome, the ensuing two or three doses may be somewhat smaller. Children of from four to twelve years of age can take the fore- going quantities without disturbance of the general health, and even for adults it is not often necessaiy to increase them, except in the way of augmenting the doses by five drops every two weeks instead of every month. In cases, however, where the bromide of zinc is not well borne, the bromide of iron may be substituted. It should be given in the form of a syrup, in doses beginning with five grains three times a day, gradually increased to fifteen or twenty. 449. ^. Ferri bromidi, Syrupi simphcis. 5j

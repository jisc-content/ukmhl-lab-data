The treatment of burns and scalds is directed—i, to the imme- diate lesion ; and 2, to its after consequences. At the time of the accidents the main indications are:—i, To exclude the air from the burn and surface by some local application ; 2, To allay pain ; 3, To bring about reaction by the judicious use of stimulants.

Carron oil and oil of turpentine are valuable when the surface of the skin is quite destroyed. Prob- ably nothing is better than swathing the part in thick layers of cotton wool, which is prevented from sticking to the burnt surface by covering this with folds of soft linen, anointed with ceratum calaminae or other simple ointment.

At the time of the accident, opium should be liberally given, and brandy to the extent of bringing about a gradual reaction. Diar- rhoea must be checked by opiates, and vomiting by creasote and prussic acid. Burns ought not to be dressed frequently; at the same time, the surgeon must guard against fetor and the accumu- lation of pus. DR. JOHN MORRIS, OF BALTIMORE.

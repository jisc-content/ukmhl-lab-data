Dusting powders, anodyne oint- ments and anodyne lotions, may be employed. Carbolic acid, gr.x to aquae f.Sj, is often of service; or, the part may be painted with flexible collodion containing morphia (gr.x to f sj), to be painted over several times a day. One of the most successful plans of treating zoster is by 'Cixz gal- vanic current. It offers a prompt and effectual means of relief. The constant current is to be applied directly to the seat of the eruption, and over the course of the nerves, by sponge electrodes. Five to ten cells are sufficient in the majority of cases, the applica- tion being contined from fifteen to thirty minutes at each sitting, and repeated every day, or twice a day, until recovery takes place. The after pains of zoster are also successfully treated by the gal- vanic current. IMPETIGO. J. M. DA COSTA, M. D., PHILA. 807. 'Sf. Unguenti picis, Unguenti hydrargyri oxidi rubri, aa §ss. M.

ANiESTHETICS. 58 on the part, and made to evaporate quickly, acted efficiently; and in another case, ten grammes applied by a spray apparatus enabled the operator to make six deep incisions into a large carbuncle without inflicting pain. CARBONIC ACID GAS. As early as 1835, Dr. Dewees, of Philadelphia, reported the employment of carbonic acid gas as a local anaesthetic in carci- noma uteri. Dr. Theodore A. Demme, of Philadelphia, has reported a num- ber of cases in the Medical and Surgical Reporter, Feb. 18, 1871, in which the " gas had proven to be of inestimable value, not only in relieving agony and suffering, but even in saving life, when all other means would probably have failed." These cases were of painful labor with threatening exhaustions, and rigid, unyielding and irritable uteri. The materials used for generating the gas are the bicarbonate of soda and tartaric acid. A common pint bottle, having attached an elastic tube about three feet in length, passing through the cork, should be provided. Into this pour three or four ounces of water, then introduce half an ounce of bicarbonate of soda, and lastly the same quantity of tartaric acid in a granular or crystalline form. The free extremity of the tube may be then applied to the sensitive part, so that the gas is thrown upon it in a stream. Some precautions are required. The patient's head should be elevated and abundance of fresh air furnished. In obstetric cases the child, as soon as born, should be removed from the bed. CHLORAL hydrate. This drug is an efficient paralysant of the sensory nerves. In cases of extensive burns of the first and second degrees, Dr. S. S. RiDDELL, of Wisconsin, reports almost immediate relief from 47.

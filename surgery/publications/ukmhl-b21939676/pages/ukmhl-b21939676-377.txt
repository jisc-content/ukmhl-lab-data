In the female, the removal of the clitoris, strongly advocated and practiced some years ago by Mr. I. Baker Brown, of London, is, undoubtedly, occasionally a simple and efficient means to check the habit. When the practice threatens injury to the intellect, and has not yielded to ordinary medication and remonstrance, the organ should, according to this authority, be removed, the excision including the corpus cavernosum clitor- idis, and the major portion of the erectores clitoridis.

BERKELEY HILL, F. R. C. S., OF LONDON. An obstinate prostatic gleet is a not infrequent result of a neg- lected or ill-treated gonorrhoea. In this treatment Mr. Hill recom- mends that if there is much pain and nocturnal irritation, a very mild anodyne suppository passed into the rectum at bedtime should be ordered, such as one-third of a grain of extract of bel- ladonna, a quarter of a grain of hydrochlorate of morphia, one grain of camphor, and ten grains of cocoa butter, melted together and cast into a conical shape. If the repeated use of the morphia interferes with the action of the liver, an occasional dose of calo- mel, with a little colocynth, should be given. While the dis- charge is whitish or opaque, two or three drops of copaiba in frequent doses is often useful; and when the prostate has lost tenderness if pressed by the finger, one or two drops of tincture of cantharides, in plain water, four times in twenty-four hours, is also sometimes magical in its effect. A good formula for the copaiba is: 913. I^. Copaibae, • Tr^ij Cinnamomi essentiee, Mucilaginis acacise, aa Ti|xx Aquas, f.^j. M. This amount four times daily. When all the pain and spasmodic twitching of the compressor muscles have passed away, cubebs in moderate doses—say, ten grains, four times daily—is sometimes useful to check the secre- tion completely.

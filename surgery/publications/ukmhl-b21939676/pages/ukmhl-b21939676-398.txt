The use of the nasal douche has met with severe condemnation from Dr. D. B. St. John Roosa, of New York, and he has detailed a number of cases in which its employment has entailed unfortu- nate results, even in skillful hands. Nevertheless, other specialists have by no means consented to banish it from practice. DR. JAMES PATTERSON CASSELLS, M. R. C. S., Has, since Roosa's paper, defined more clearly the proper mode of using it. {Dublin Journal of Medical Science, 1877.) He says: "I never use it except in appropriate cases; never trust the use of the syphon douche to the patient, but in every case do the operation upon the individual myself; self-use, in this as in many similar circumstances, mostly means self abuse. After deciding that the case is one in which the douche is admissible, I observe the following precautions, which, I may add, are applicable to the various modifications of the process. To have the fluid to be used non-irritating—of a density greater than the serum of the blood— about 90° Fah. in temperature, and never to 7tse pjire water alone. To give the column of fluid a fall from a point about one foot above the level of the patient's nose, patient meanwhile leaning (392)

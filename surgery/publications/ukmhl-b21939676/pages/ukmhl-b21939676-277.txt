ODONTALGIA. 271 Mr. James Merson, L. D. S., in the Biitish jfournal of Dental Science, 1878, states that the following formula will prevent the pain of tooth extraction. Hundreds of patients told him they did not feel the pain: 322. IJ. Chloroform pur., 3iij Tr. aconiti (Fleming's), 3iij Tr. capsici, 3j Tr. pyrethri, 3ss 01. caryoph., §ss Gum camph., 3ss. M. The tooth and surrounding gums are to be previously dried, and then four or five drops of this applied with cotton wOol. Then without delay use the forceps, but the instrument 7n7csl be warmed. This is most important. For toothache, a pellet of cotton wool soaked in the above, and introduced into the cavity, will give speedy relief. The following odontalgics are recommended by various writers: 323. Vy.. Tincturje aconiti, f.3ss Tincturse benzoini, f3ij. M. Immerse a piece of cotton in this liquid, and introduce it into the cav- ity of the aching tooth. 324. I^. Chloroformi, Creasoti, Vini opii, aa f.3ss Tincturas benzoini, f.3ijss. M.

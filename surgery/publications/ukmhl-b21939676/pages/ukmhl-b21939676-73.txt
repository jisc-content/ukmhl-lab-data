67 THE OPEN TREATMENT OF WOUNDS. 1. That suppurative fever is very much diminished, and in some cases almost entirely obviated, by this method of dressing. 2. That the tendency to the formation of abscesses is very much lessened. 3. That the predisposition to erysipelatous inflammation is diminished. Wounds thus freely exposed to the air, when kept for some time in one position, and so placed that the discharges easily escape, are said to succeed as well as wounds treated by the other meth- ods; and this opinion is supported by statistics advanced by sur- geons who have given the plan an extensive trial. The explanation offered of its success is that part of the secretions form a crust upon the surface of the wound, the rest flows away, and the wound remains odorless. The crust is dry, and consequently unfavorable for the development of spores that may fall upon it; and when it comes off" it discloses a healthy, granulating, perhaps partly cica- trized surface, which cannot be easily injured by contact with fer- ments. This is the " healing under a scab" of the English authors. Billroth says the .method was first introduced in 1856 by Vezin, and that he himself adopted it in i860, and has since employed it with the best results in amputations, resections, and after the re- moval of many tumors. Its chief advantage is, that it protects against the dangerous primary phlegmonous inflammations, by allowing free escape of all the secretions; but it'does not protect against erysipelas and hospital gangrene, and is useless when in- flammation has once set in. If the wound is irregular, and per- mits the accumulation of pus and secretions, there is danger of inoculation by micrococci.

CARIES AND NECROSIS. 231 CARIES AND NECROSIS. In all cases of caries and necrosis affecting the superficial bones, Dr. F. KiRKPATRicK, Dublin, speaks with the utmost confidence of the application of potassa cum calce {British Medical Journal, Aug., 1867). He introduces it into the fistulze leading down to the diseased bone, converting them into large openings, so that the carious bone is brought into view and within reach of the further application of the caustic. MR. POLLOCK, OF LONDON. The plan proposed by this surgeon {Lancet, May, 1870,) in caries and necrosis, and successfully carried out by others, is to expose the diseased bone and apply to it, with a glass brush, a solution of equal parts of sulphuric acid and water ; or, a lotion, of one part of the strong acid to six of water is kept in constant contact with the part by means of pieces of lint saturated with it. The strength of the acid is gradually raised until it is appMed pure. Dr. Efhraim Cutter, of Cambridge, Mass., has succeeded with a modified form of this treatment, injecting the diseased cavity with the following solution, at first twice a day, afterward once a day: 275.

This should be used diluted, one part to ten of water, and applied to the part once or twice daily, by means of a sponge and bandage, or injected with a syringe. The solution, when properly made, has a light-green, opaque color. Wine vinegar, not cider vinegar, must be used in preparing it. Prof Andrews, of Chicago, has obtained excellent results in some cases of carious bones by injecting them thoroughly, through the orifices of the wound, twice daily with a solution of carbolic acid, ten grains to the ounce.

This, he states, has succeeded after numerous other vaunted remedies had failed. DR. COMEGYS PAUL, OF PHILADELPHIA. This writer {Medical Times, November, 1873) directs attention anew to ordinary commercial petroleum, as an inexpensive and efficient antiseptic and stimulating application to ulcerous and sup- purating surfaces. He has found the petroleum to be most useful as an application'to non-specific sluggish ulcers, and to all suppur- ating wounds that have a tendency to heal with an unhealthy and easily ruptured cicatrix. As an injection of sinuses, either connected or unconnected with diseased bones, the result will be satisfactory. In a bone- sinus it can be used without interruption, materially diminishing the discharge. It is valuable in all inflammations of an erysipelatous character, being applied like an ordinary fomentation. The spreading of the disease is, apparently, favorably influenced, and the duration short- ened in many cases. , , , j Wounds dressed with petroleum should be thoroughly cleansed, then covered with saturated lint, and where there has been deep- seated destruction of the tissues, charpie fully impregnated with it should be packed into the cavities, and the whole overspread with oiled silk, waxed paper, or a piece of muslin spread with lard. The smell is not at all oppressive, and does not cling to the fingers after ablution. SIR JAMES PAGET. S&?e1r' equal parts. M. For senile ulcers.

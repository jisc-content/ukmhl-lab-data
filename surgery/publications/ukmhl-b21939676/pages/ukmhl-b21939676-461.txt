GLANDULAR HYPERTROPHIES, 455 believes it would do well in fibrous tumors also. {Lancet, August, 1874.) MR. FURNEAUX JORDAN, ENGLAND. This surgeon employs counier-irritation to remove enlarged glands. The best locality for the counter-irritant is around or adjacent to the enlargement. Blisters or iodine may be employed. In enlarged cervical glands a large patch of iodine irritation at the back of the neck, which may be prolonged below the glands, will, he states, certainly prove successful in a short time. MR. S. MESSENGER BRADLEY, F. R. C. S., ENGLAND. Injection with the tincture of iodine is largely employed by this surgeon. He has even succeeded in producing absorption of some encapsulated tumors situated on the salivary glands by this means. As a rule two or three injections, gtt. v-xv of the simple tincture, are sufficient to effect a cure. He lays down the following rules as to its application: 1. Cases to be treated by Iodine Injections. True hypertrophies of the cervical glands without scrofula; strumous hypertrophies of the cervical glands before they have broken down; hard, non- infectious lymphomata; all encapsulated tumors, as a tentative operation. 2. Cases to be treated by Incision. Lymphatic tumors that have broken down into pus. 3. Cases for Extirpation zvith the Knife. Strumous glands which form tumors riddled with soft patches, and resting on a base of suppurating cellular tissue, with a large area of blue skin; encap- sulated tumors which have resisted the treatment by injection.

The eschar is white, and ordinarily sepa- rates the fifth or sixth day. The advantages attributed to this caustic in the treatment of tumors are the following:—i. Ener- getic escharotic effect. 2. Rapidity of action. 3. Easy manage- ment. 4. No tendency to run. 5. Freedom from danger.

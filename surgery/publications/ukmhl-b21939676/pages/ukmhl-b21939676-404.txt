A carbolic acid solution of varying strength has been used by- other surgeons for injecting the duct by means of an Anel's eye syringe. In a late article, Dr. G. Stampinati {Mov. Med. Chir., March, 1876,) refers to a number of cases where treatment had been unsuccessful, but which were rapidly cured by the following method: A thirty per cent, solution of persulphate of iron was di- luted with two parts of water, and this fluid injected by means of an Anel's syringe into the sac. After remaining a few minutes, the fluid was aspirated with the same syringe. The injection may be made every day, and after repeating it about'twenty times, a permanent cure is obtained. OZ^NA. JAMES E. GARRETSON, M. D., D. D. S. Ozsena arises from various conditions, the nature of which must direct our treatment. The principal of these are as follows : 1. Accumulation and degeneration of the common antral secretion. This is most frequently observed in the course of an ordinary coryza. It requires little treatment. The patient may be directed to sniff up the nostril of the affected side some such combination as the following : 544. yEtheris sulphurici, Tincturae iodinii, For insufflation. If this fails to check the discharge, then constitutional treat- ment, such as is called for, is indicated. A plethoric patient should have a dose or two of sulphate of magnesia, and a restricted diet; an anaemic patient should have a tonic regimen with some iron and quinine internally. 2. Fetid discharges from tooth abscesses opening into the antrum. This form of ozaena is cured as a rule by extracting the decayed tooth. If this does not succeed, injections are to be made through f.!j f.!ij

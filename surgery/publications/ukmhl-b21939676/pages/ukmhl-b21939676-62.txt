56 AN/ESTHETICS. LOCAL ANi:STHETICS. ACETIC ACID. The following, mixed in a thin flask, will produce vapor which induces local anaesthesia in five minutes : 45. ^. Glacial acetic acid, Chloroform, aa partes cquales. ALCOHOL. Dr. HoRVATH, of Kiefif, has proposed a method of employing al- cohol for producing local anaesthesia. It is well known that if the hand be immersed for a short time in ice water, severe pain is caused. Dr. Horvath found that no such pain was produced when the hand was immersed in cold alcohol, not even when the temperature of the alcohol was as low as 5° C. Glycerine was found to possess a similar property. Ether caused pain, and quicksilver more acute pain still, causing the speedy withdrawal of the finger when plunged into this liquid at a temperature of 3°. It was next ascertained that when the finger was held for quite a long time in alcohol having a temperature of 5° C, no pain was experienced. Moreover, although the faintest touch was distinctly perceived in his finger, no pain was experienced from sharp pricks. The application of cold alcohol has the effect of depriving the part of the special sensibility to pain, without, however, impairing the delicacy of the general tactile sensation, which, as is well known, resides in the superficial integument. CARBOLIC ACID. . In the application of the actual cautery, and such procedures, the pain may be avoided by the application of carbolic acid. This local anaesthetic is not used with near the frequency which its efficacy deserves. Pure carbolic acid should be applied to the parts to be cauter- ized, which are then covered with a light compress; after a short time, before the anaesthetic effect has passed off, apply the cautery. There will be a complete absence of pain. It is immaterial whether the acid be liquid or crystallized ; in the former case it is to be applied with a brush, in the latter it extends over the parts as it liquefies.

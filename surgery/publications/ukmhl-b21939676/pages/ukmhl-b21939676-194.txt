LESIONS FROM HEAT AND COLD. i88 a man who, struck down oii deck by h'ghtning, and being entirely insensible, was brought to consciousness and recovery by the rapid extraction of over forty ounces of blood. I have not myself had the opportunity of treating a case of lightning-shock in the human subject, but an experience of another kind bears directly upon the value of the remedy in such cases. In experimenting with the great induction coil at the Polytechnic College, I tried to kill large animals—sheep—painlessly, by an electrical discharge derived from a Leyden battery set ' in cascade,' and presenting ninety-six feet of surface. This shock is identical with the fatal intense shock of lightning, and by passing it once through the body of a sheep, it rendered the animal instantaneously unconscious—to all appearance dead, and, as I found by one line of experiment, actu- ally dead, if nothing were done to the animal. But in another line of experiment, the animals, so soon as they were stricken, were removed by the butcher, and were subjected to division of the vessels of the neck in the usual manner of killing in the slaughter- house. At first blood flowed very slowly from the operation, but in a short time the current became freer, and, as it became free, the phenomena of active life, previously suspended in the animals, returned. There was return of consciousness, of motion, of struggle for liberty, and all those proofs of life that an animal passes through, previous to convulsion, when it is submitted to slaughter without shock. " If we connect the experience of those of our predecessors who have successfully employed blood-letting for the cure of lightning stroke with the experimental facts I have here adduced, the infer- ence is, I think, as fair as inference can be, that blood-letting is the remedy for the effects of the shock of lightning."

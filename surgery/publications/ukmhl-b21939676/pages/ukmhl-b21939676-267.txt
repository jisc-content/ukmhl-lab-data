During the operation, a bandage is applied tightly round the limb above the vein to be operated on, and this is not to be removed for three hours after, for fear of embolism. The " iodo- tannic" solution is injected to an amount varying from ten to twenty-five drops. The effect is to cause immediate coagulation of the blood at the part acted on. At first there is no pain, but after a few hours a severe burning sensation sets in, and the vein begins to inflame slightly in each direction. This never reaches any serious degree, but it is sufficient to cause obliteration for some distance above and below the spot injected, ^he author states that there is no fear of embolism. He has operated in more than two hundred cases without any accident, and has found the results much more permanent and complete than after any other operation. DR. VOGT, OF BERLIN. 304. ^.

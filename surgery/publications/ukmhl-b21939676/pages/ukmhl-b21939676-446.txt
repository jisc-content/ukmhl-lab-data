LESIONS OF THE ORGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE. 440 THE EAR. ECZEMA OF THE AURICLE. In cases of children Professor Gruber has found that both glycerine and cod-liver oil, applied on pledgets of charpie, and bound firmly to the eczematous auricle, are of great value. Dr. Burnett recommends the following powders: 633. Florum zinci, 3ij Aluminis, Amyl, aa ^j. M. For a powder. 634. I^. Zinci oxydi, 5j_iv Amyl, 3vij-ix. For a powder. Either of these may be dusted carefully and thoroughly over the diseased auricle, and the latter should then remain undisturbed as much as possible. If the heat and burning becomes very great, cloths steeped in cold water may be applied. In the subacute form of auricular eczema, the organ may be treated beneficially by the application of aceium cantharidis to the sluggish parts, and then penciling the latter with the following: 635. I^. Olei cadini, f.5ij Alcoholis, f.§j. M. This will often prevent the disease from becoming chronic. Should in spite of this, however, the disease pass to the chronic stage, the best local treatment is painting the diseased parts with acetum cantharidis, solution of nitrate of silver (gr. x ad f Sj), and the application of emollients, the head being kept dry and cool. The following ointment is also useful: 636. I^. Hydrargyri ammoniati, gr.x-xx Adipis, §j. M. To be rubbed in gently and thoroughly. When the eczematous disease has invaded the auditory canal, and stimulation of the parts is needed, an ointment may be used composed as follows: 637. ^. Hydrargyri ammonio-chloridi, 9j Unguenti adipis, 5j' Apply with a camel's hair pencil to the canal once or twice daily.

ABSCESSES. mr. george w. callender, of london, surgeon to st. Bartholomew's hospital. This surgeon recommends the treatment of abscesses by hyper- distension with dilute carboHc acid. The operation may be per- formed whilst the patient is under the influence of ether, or the integuments may be frozen by the ether-spray. The following are required: A scalpel where an incision is needed, no open sinus existing; carbolic acid lotion (one part in twenty) diluted to one in thirty by the addition of warm water before using it; a perforated elastic drainage-tube; carbolized oil (one in twelve) on lint for dressing the wound, and gutta-percha tissue for covering this; some ordinary adhesive plaster; some tenax to receive any subse- quent discharge (which, however, is very slight); an ordinary two or four-ounce syringe. When it is desirable to make continuous pressure over an abscess after opening it, a pad shaped to the needs of the case, and filled with shot, will be found useful. It acts more effectually than a sand bag, and is easily made and adapted. The operation is begun by cutting into the abscess (if no sinus exists), the .opening made being of sufficient size to admit one of the fingers. The pus is then allowed to escape, the abscess being emptied as completely as possible. The nozzle of a syringe is next passed through the opening, and the skin is drawn closely around it by the operator with his left hand; the contents of the syringe are then passed into the abscess-sac. Care must be taken in doing this, that no pressure is made upon the abscess-wall, or the dis- tension of the sac will be incomplete. Either by using a syringe

Mercurial ointment should also be rubbed into the thighs every other night, for twenty minutes; and thirty drops of cod-liver oil, with one-half grain of iodide of iron, should be administered twice a day to an infant six months old. For syphilitic iritis, mercury, judiciously employed, is the sheet-anchor to be relied upon. The best mode of employing it in these cases is by inunction. Our author never prescribes mercury internally for children, nor does he find it necessary to push the treatment so far as to affect the gum. According to Mackenzie, and, indeed, all the best authorities, atropia ought to be employed as a collyrium in every case of iritis, and in all stages of the disease.

4t6 LESIONS OF THE ORGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE. It is not easy to have the plasma properly prepared. The proper formula is to make simple plasma or Glyceriiium Amyli, B. P., take i oz. starch and 8 fluid oz. pure glycerine, rub the starch with an ounce of distilled water till quite blended, then add the glycerine and apply heat, gradually increased, till a thick jelly is produced. The preparation must be constantly and thoroughly stirred while making, and if an appearance of granular lumps is shown, squeeze the product before it is cold through cheese-cloth, or doubled muslin, previously well washed to remove any loose fibres.

When thoroughly tritur- ated, the simple plasma is added in the desired proportion, and mixed thoroughly. The efficiency of the trituration may be best tested by rubbing a few grains of the plasma on a piece of fine white paper. On holding this up to the light, there should be no appearance what- ever of any specks. PROFESSOR DAVID W. YANDELL, M. D., LOUISVILLE.

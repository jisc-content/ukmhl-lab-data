74 THE DRESSING OF WOUNDS. healing it is necessary to induc(? suppuration in the wound. The idea of Dolbeau is to maintain the alcohoUc dryness {secheresse alcooliquc) till all risk of traumatic fever is past, and till the patient sleeps and eats naturally, and has so gained strength. He then considers that the time has arrived for promoting suppuration with a view to cicatrization. Glycerine dressings are forthwith used- If the formation of pus is excessive, occasional alcoholic dress- ings are employed to moderate it. Dolbeau maintains that by following the method now briefly described, traumatic fever is pre- vented, and the surgeon is enabled to arrest or diminish the sup- puration of wounds at his pleasure. DR. DAVID BLAIR, OF SCOTLAND. In the Glasgow Medical Journal, Feb., 1870, this writer recom- mends the use of whisky as a surgical application. He washes the wound with the whisky, and then wraps it in rags saturated with the fluid, covering the whole with gutta-percha tissue or oiled silk. As a rule, the first dressing is not disturbed for three or four days, and afterwards every day or every second day. The princi- pal thing to be attended to is to have the bandage kept wet with the whisky, but not too wet. He has never seen erysipelas follow in a wound thus treated, and suppuration has always been moder- ate. In treating bed sores, he finds poultices mixed with whisky and whisky lotions of superior efficacy. In cases of chronic and scrofulous abscess he has used it as an injection, and found that it checked the discharge and hastened the cure. Dr. HoRVATH has had an opportunity of testing the value of al- coholic application to burns on his own person, as well as upon others, and not only was all pain instantly allayed directly the part was immersed in cold alcohol, but it was found that the wound very speedily began to assume a more healthy appearance, the sur- rounding redness rapidly failing.

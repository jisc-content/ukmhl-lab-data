"The first duty of a surgeon in impending inflammation," says the late Prof. N. R. Smith, M. D., of Baltimore, in one of his lec- tures, "is to remove all sources of irritation" ( TJie Baltimore Medical journal and Bulletin, Jan., 1871). These may be mechanical irri- tants, as some foreign body whose presence may be unsuspected by the patient, especially in the case of children. Leaden bullets and polished needles cause the least irritation of any classes of foreign bodies. Prof Smith, in his fifty years' experience never saw a case of tetanus caused by a needle. Other sources of irrita- tion may be pressure, as in bed sores, friction, as of broken bones, malformation, etc.

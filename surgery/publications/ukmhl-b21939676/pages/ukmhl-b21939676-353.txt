This amount is to be given at first every four hours, its action being supplemented by the use of the catheter twice daily, until the pa- tient regains entire control of the bladder.

This surgeon, in advanced prostatic disease, has recourse to a form of suprapubic puncture. Having anaesthetized his patient, he forcibly distends the bladder with water, unless it should be capable of being filled by allowing the urine to accumulate. For this purpose he injects sometimes as much as forty ounces of water. He then punctures the bladder just above the pubes with an ordi- nary trocar, leaving the canula in the bladder during four, five, or six days. At the end of this lapse of time, the parts traversed by the canula having become consolidated, a tubular tract is formed, through which, on removal of the canula, a soft rubber catheter

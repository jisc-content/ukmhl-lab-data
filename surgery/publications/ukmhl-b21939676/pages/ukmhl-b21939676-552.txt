DISEASES OF THE SKIN. 546 lard 5j, will destroy the parasite upon the surface, but in a few weeks the disease will return.' DR. TILBURY FOX, LONDON. In tinea favosa the hair should be cut short; the crusts must be removed by soaking with : 870. I^. Sodae hyposulphitis, 5iv Glycerinas, f.5ij Aquas, ad f,§vj. M. Or, if preferred, with: 871. I^. Sodse hyposulphitis, ^iij Acidi sulphurosi diluti, f.§ss Aqu^, ad Oj. M. When the scalp is cleaned, each hair must be extracted one by one, and parasiticides applied at once. Our author prefers for this purpose: 872. Sodae biboratis, . _ 3j Hydrargyri chloridi corrosivi, gr.x-xx Aquae, M. A certain portion of the surface should be cleared each day, and the whole head meanwhile kept .moistened with sulphurous acid lotion.

A careful search should be made for broken-off hairs, and these or the scales, and any attached hairs, should be submitted for microscopic examination for fungous elements in them. In •cases of chronic ringworm, all merely scurvy patches should be carefully examined, for a solitary piece of dead hair lodged in the follicle may explain the mischief, as it is generally loaded with fungous elements, which are readily sown broad-cast to relight up the old mischief if parasiticide treatment is abandoned. Such ill- developed cases of ringworm, as before observed, may be the source of infection to many a child, in public institutions and schools. Dr. Dyce Duckworth has suggested a simple and valuable means of recognizing true ringworm of the scalp. A few drops

The skin surrounding- the ulcer should be protected by grease, but the edges may be left clear for the action of the caustic. The chloride of zinc and caustic potash are slower in action, and must be left longer in contact with the sore, or they will not penetrate deeply enough to destroy it altogether. The actual cautery, by hot iron or galvanic wire, is at times very useful when a large amount of tissue has to be destroyed; otherwise it is not preferable to chem- ical caustics, while it alarms the patient much more than the latter. When the caustic has done its work and the excess is washed away with cold water, the sore should be wrapped in wet lint, and the pain, which often lasts several hours, can be assuaged by the constant application of ice-cold water.

A favorite mixture of our author, in the late form of the disease, is the freshly formed red oxide of mercury, which he makes according to the following formula : 963.

He does not think it worth while to commence the treatment until positive signs of constitutional poisoning are manifest, such as induration of the post-cervical glands and the early cutaneous eruptions. Any preparation of mercury may be used. The protiodide is perhaps the most convenient. 964. Hydrargyri protiodidi, 9j Tragacanthae, q. s. Make one hundred and twenty small pills.

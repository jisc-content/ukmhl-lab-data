THE DRESSING OF WOUNDS. 76 PROFESSOR JOSEPH LISTER, 0,F EDINBURGH, (nOW LONDON). The apparatus required by this teacher is extensive, and his method full of minutiae. The antiseptic agent he prefers is carbolic acid, which he employs as follows: A vessel is at hand with a solu- tion of one to forty parts for the immersion of the hands of the operator, the instruments and sponges ; a steam atomizer throws a spray of about the same strength over the part, etc., during the operation or dressing; carbolized catgut ligatures are used for ligating the arteries; carbolized gauze, fine gutta-percha tissue, India-rubber drainage tubes, and carbolated oil silk, are employed for dressing. With these at hand, he directs the surgeon to proceed as fol- lows: (i) Shave the part, if there is much hair, in order that the antiseptic may not be prevented from acting upon the skin; (2) wash the part with a watery solution (l to 20) to purify the skin; (3) direct the spray upon that part, and maintain its action and position during the entire operation and dressing, without a moment's interval; (4) immerse the hands, instruments, and sponges in the i to 40 solution before operating, and at every in- terval of the operation when they are not enveloped by the spray; (5) tie all vessels with antiseptic catgut and cut the ligatures at the knot; (6) place the drainage tube or tubes so deeply in the wounds as to drain all accumulating fluids ; if the tube enters obliquely, cut the outer extremity obliquely; lay the retaining threads on the surface: (7) if the wound is to be closed, as after amputation, use carbolized silk for sutures, as it is very superior to wire, not only on account of its perfect suppleness, but because its actively antiseptic character insures absence of putrefaction in the track of the wound; (8) if strapping is required, common adhesive plaster may be rendered antiseptic by dipping it for a second or two in a watery solution of the acid, and it is most convenient to have the lotion hot; the ends should be overlapped by the gauze; (9) apply to the cicatrizing part a layer of the oiled silk protective, dipped in the watery solution, and having a hole for the drainage-tube; (10) apply eight layers of the gauze, of such size as to cover all the wound and the adjacent parts; dip the first layer in the solution; between the last two layers place a piece of mackintosh of smaller size than the layers of gauze ; apply the lower layer so as to cover in completely the mackintosh; (11) retain the dressings by band- ages of the antiseptic gauze, over which elastic webbing may be

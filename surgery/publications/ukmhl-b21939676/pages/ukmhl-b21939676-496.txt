490 THE TREATMENT OF SCROFULA, tinued for some time, it is often well to change it for the following, which will be found an excellent substitute : 708. Quinise sulphatis, 5j Syrupi rhei aromatici, vSyrupi zingiberis, aa f.^j Syrupi simplicis, f.^ij. M. One teaspoonful three times daily. Where the child is pale and emaciated, without the existence of intestinal irritation, 5ij of the precipitated carbonate of iron may- be added to either of the above mixtures, with, in many cases, the happiest result. When the lymphatic ganglions, submaxillary glands, or testicles become enlarged, the iodide of potassium is preferable to any other remedy. By far the best form when the patient is near the age of puberty is Blanchard's pills, pihdce ferri iodidi, U. S. Ph. The worst case of ganglionic enlargement will yield in three months to the use of these pills. Dr. Toland has not found cod-liver oil of much value in this disease. Locally, to scrofulous enlargements and indurations, an excel- lent application is: 709. Tincturse arnicse, Tincturse iodinii, aa f.^ss. Paint the parts morning and evening. When the skin is delicate, as in children, we may use: 710. 'S^. Potassii iodidi, 3j Alcoholis, Aquse, Apply on saturated lint to the part, and cover with oiled silk. Operations for scrofulous affections should be confined to the bones, and should not be performed until â€¢ the periosteum is de- tached and the whole of the disease removed; then the bone is speedily reproduced, and the result in many cases extraordinarily successful.

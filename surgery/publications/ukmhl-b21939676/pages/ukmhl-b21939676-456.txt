450 NEW GROWTHS. this form are dangerous because often followed by sloughing; and that extirpation with the knife is also dangerous, because of the hemorrhage. ARTHUR TREHERNE NORTON, F. R. C. S., OF LONDON.* If the goitre arises from local causes, as the drinking-water, etc., the patient must change his residence or treatment will be unavail- ing. If anemia is present, iron is demanded. In cases where the growth is not of long duration, treatment by absorbents, externally and internally, is generally successful. Mr. Norton usually pre- scribes : 650. Potassii iodidi, Ferri ammonio-citratis, aa gr.v Infusi quassiae, f.^j. M. This amount at a dose. For a lotion he prefers one containing iodine in proportion not sufficient to irritate the skin: 651. Tinct. iodinii, 5ss-3j Glycerini, 3ij Aqus, aa Â§j. M. This lotion has the advantage of not evaporating, while the iodine, being very small in quantity, is not irritating to the skin, and at the same time is readily absorbed into the part, because evaporation does not take place. It should be applied on lint, which should always be kept moist with the lotion; over the lint may be sewn a piece of oiled silk, and over this again a piece of velvet, which altogether hides the application. The operative procedures which may be resorted to are: punc- turing cysts, setons, injections, ligating the thyroid vessels, and extirpation. Mr. Norton condemns the last two. Setons pro- mote absorption, but he has never seen them bring about a com- plete cure. There is no danger in evacuating large and fluctuating cysts. There is but little danger in injections, though he had seen one case of death from their use. PROF. A. LUCKE.

244 LESIONS OF THE BONES AND JOINTS. attention required will be end vigorously antiphlogistic. A cure almost magical in the rapidity with which it results is sometimes secured by cauterizing the surface with the solid nitrate of silver. When cachexia is present, local sedation must be combined with constitutional specific medication. A common treatment for an acutely inflamed joint might be laid down as follows: Put the feet and legs in water as hot as can be borne: administer a full saline cathartic or a diuretic; apply a lead-water and lauda- num lotion to the inflamed part; bleed with the lancet, or locally, with leeches; depress the circulatory force by the administration of arterial sedatives, and restrict to a low diet; use counter-irritants; any or all of these means being employed according to the indica- tions of the case, an exception to the use of the pediluvium exist- ing in inflammation of the inferior joints. The inflammation, having its acuteness thus broken, is often brought to a happy termination by painting the joint with the tincture of iodine, or with diluted Monsel's solution of the persul- phate of iron, and afterwards, if necessary, enveloping the parts in a lead and laudanum lotion. Where structural change is feared, as the result of eff-usions, mercurials maybe administered and pushed to the least perceptible evidence of their impression. When in defiance of treatment, suppuration occurs in a jomt, the pus formed is to be got clear of as speedily as possible. To eff-ect this, it is, perhaps, not possible to adopt a better plan than the subcutaneous valvular puncture, to be made by usmg a deli- cate tenotome. At this stage we may also resort to direct stimu- lation with prospects of good results; stimulating embrocations, hot and cold douches, strapping, painting, passive motion, or even injections into the joint itself, may save the articulation when other means fail.

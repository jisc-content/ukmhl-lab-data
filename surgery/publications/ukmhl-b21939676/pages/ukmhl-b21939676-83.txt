77 ANTISEPTIC DRESSINGS, applied when the bandage is not sufficient, as in wounds or ab- scesses of the groin. Inspect the wound on the day after its inflic- tion, whether it be accidental or the result of operation, and change the dressing only in case the discharge is liable to extend beyond the edge of the folded gauze ; during the subsequent progress of the case, leave the gauze undisturbed for periods varying from two days to a week, according to the diminution of the effusion. In re-dressing continue the spray uninterruptedly on the part; while the bandage is being cut or removed, the patient, or an assistant, keeps his hand over the site of the wound, to prevent the dressing from rising en masse, and pumping in septic air; in raising the folded gauze take care that the spray passes into the angle between it and the skin; remove the drainage-tubes, cleanse them in the carbolic-acid solution, and before re-introducing them cut off such portions as the granulations in the wound render necessary to bring the external extremity flush with the surface of the skin; lay aside the gauze which is soaked, but use the mackintosh again after cleansing it with carbolic-acid solution. A very important part of Mr, Lister's treatment is the provision he makes to secure a free escape from the wound or abscess cavity of all secretions. This he effects by the introduction of India-rub- ber drainage tubes of sufficient calibre, and provided with a suffi- cient number of lateral perforations to secure a ready escape of all fluids, Mr, Lister has pointed out that under his system it is es- pecially necessary to make this provision ; for, when applied to fresh-cut surfaces, the carbolic acid, by its stimulating properties, excites an abundant secretion, which if retained within the wound- cavity would be a serious source of danger; while in the treatment of abscesses the use of the drainage-tubes is insisted on, to avoid tension of the abscess walls by accumulation of pus—tension being, according to Mr, Lister's view, a most potent source of continued suppuration and constitutional irritation, Mr, Lister states that the spontaneous cure of caries under anti- septic treatment is a striking feature of the system, but in order that it may occur he considers it to be essential that the diseased part should be kept absolutely at rest—a condition that is difficult to secure in the treatment of some joints, but can readily be com- plied with in the case of spinal caries. Lumbar and psoas abscesses, which generally do badly after evacuation, are, according to Mr. Lister, most hopeful subjects of treatment, provided that unremit-

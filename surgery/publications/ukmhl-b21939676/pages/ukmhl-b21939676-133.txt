The demand for alcohol as food and as an aid to assimilation is very great in this disease. Recently Dr. Theodor Clemens, of Frankfort on-the Main, has reported eight cases of severe type which recovered under the administration of good red wine in as large amounts as they would drink. Aquce Calcis, with milk, is a valuable dietetic auxiliary. Dr. Joseph Bell, of Edinburgh, has reported three recoveries in which, with hardly any medicine, he gave milk with hme water, eggs and beef tea at short intervals. Carboliciim Acidum has been experimented with in pyaemia, but the re- sults are unsatisfactory. Ferri Chloridi Tinctura has been administered in large doses, with little benefit. Hypophospliites of sodium, potassium and ammonium. These have yielded good results in some cases, and deserve trial. > Hyposulphites. The sulphites and bisulphites of the alkaline metals were largely used during our war, but the general experience was that they are of little use. *QuinicB Sulphas. M. Verneuil, of Paris, as well as many other sur- geons, speak emphatically of the value of quinine, given in large doses. To prevent the rigors. Dr. Gross prescribes : 146. ^..

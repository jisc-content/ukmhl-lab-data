208 LESIONS OF MUSCULAR TISSUE. Dr. C. B. Hall, of Cincinnati, in the Cincinnati Lancet and Ob- sei-ver, December, 1873, gives the following prescription : 236, Tinct. arnicae florum, 2 parts Acid, tannic, i " Pulv. acaciae, i Â«< A fragment of lint wet with this mixture to be placed upon the boil and changed every fifteen minutes until a coating is formed. This causes the throbbing pain to disappear, diminishes the tension of the integuments, causes the abortion of the boil, or, if too late for that, hastens the separation of the core. Some surgeons report favorable results from the early applica- tion of pounded ice to an incipient furuncle; while others extol the value of early and liberal applications of mercurial ointmejit. general treatment.

The internal use of arsenic has many advocates (see below). The propriety of using the knife in carbuncles, either by crucial incision, by subcutaneous sweeps, or by the total excision of the diseased structure, all of which methods have their warm parti- sans, has been seriously questioned and wholly rejected by such eminent authorities as Dumreicher, Billroth, Dittel, Le Gros Clark, and

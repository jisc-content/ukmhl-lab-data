(245) IXILESIONS OF THE ORGANS OF CIRCULATION. Aneurism—Lymphangitis—Ncsvus—Phlebitis— Vai'icose Veins. ANEURISM. J. M. DA COSTA, M. D., PHILADELPHIA. This author states there are but two remedies in which he has any faith in the radical treatment of internal aneurism. The first is iodide of potassium. It should be used boldly. The following recipe was given continuously for ten months, with the most marked beneficial results, in a case of chronic aneurism : 283. Potassii iodidi, gr.xv Syrupi tolutani, Aquae, aa f.5i. M. For one dose, thrice daily. This remedy does no good excepting early in the disease. The second remedy referred to is ergot. It is not yet known definitely how much good it really does. Some very excellent re- sults have been obtained by Langenbeck. It may be given inter- nally or by hypodermic injections. In a disease so dangerous, so almost necessarily fatal, the im- portance of a knowledge of any remedy which seems to exert an influence is apparent. As both the iodide of potassium and ergot can be tried without injury to the patient, it is the duty of every practitioner, in cases of internal aneurism (in which, of course, surgical treatment is out of the question), to try one or the other of these drugs. The following formula may be used for the hypodermic injection of ergotin : 284. ]^. Ergotinse, gr.ij Spiritfts rini rectificatse, GlycerinjE, aa f.5ss. M. Five minims (equal to gr.^ of ergotin) for a dose. This is the formula of EULENBERG.

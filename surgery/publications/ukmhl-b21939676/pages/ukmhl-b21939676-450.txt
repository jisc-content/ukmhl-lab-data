444 LESIONS OF THE ORGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE. After the use of the astringent for four or five weeks, it is well to change it, or add a solution of two grains of sulphate of copper or nitrate of lead. If there are large granulations, the solid nitrate of silver maybe applied on a probe charged with it; or a solu- tion of sulphate of zinc, gr.xxx to f.5j. Constitutional treatment is demanded in case of the strumous or other dyscrasia. M. MENIERE, OF PARIS. This distinguished otologist says that in all cases of otorrhoea great attention must be paid to the constitution, to correct any dyscrasia that is present. In this lies an essential element of suc- cess in all instances. Cleanliness is the next point, which must receive the closest care. Nothing is better than pure warm water injected from an ordinary syringe with moderate force. In the early stage, and when the otorrhea is accompanied by sharp pain, the water may be medicated with a little opium; a leech or two may be placed behind the ear; and the whole ear may be covered with a linseed-meal poultice on which a little laudanum has been sprinkled. When the pain remains very intense, hypodermic injections of morphia are the most advisable means. In cases of long standing, warm injections are always indicated. They may be of water, or weakly medicated as follows : 643.

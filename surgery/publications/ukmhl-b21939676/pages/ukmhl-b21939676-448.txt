442 LESIONS OF THE ORGANS OF SPECIAL SENSE. catarrhal symptoms should be reheved by a .saline aperient and an active diaphoretic, and locally thorough inflation of the tympanum should be secured by using Politzer's air bag, the Eustachian catheter, or Valsalva's method. (See below, under Otorrhea) In little children we may employ, as suggested by Mr. Hinton a piece of india-rubber tubing, through one end of which the sur- geon may blow, while the other end is inserted into a nostril of the child. Should the pain become intense, leeches may be ap- plied directly under the auricle. Anodynes may be given to allay pain. Where the fauces and Eustachian tube are inflamed, irri- gation of the naso-pharynx with warm water slightly impregnated with salt or chlorate of potash is beneficial. Thudichum's nasal douche may be employed. Chronic catarrhal inflai7tmation of the middle ear may be either moist or dry. Both varieties require constitutional treatment by such drugs as iodide of iron, iodide of potassium and bichloride of mercury. In the large majority of cases local treatment should be rather to the nares and pharynx than to the tympanum. Irri- gation by means of the nasal douche is very important. In cases of swelling and narrowing of the Eustachian tube, inflation is in- dicated. DR. EUGENE H. TRIQUET, OF PARIS. 641. ^. Cupri sulphatis, gr.xv Mellis rosas, f zj Aquas ross, fgiij, m.

ORCHITIS (epididymitis). 373 Apply to the part as hot as can be borne and cover with a piece of oiled silk. Renew every eight hours. Ordinarily, the testicle will be nearly painless in a few hours. When the pain is exceptionally acute, and the cord is strangu- lated, ten to fifteen leeches above the groin, along the course of the cord, will often calm the pain as by magic. When the pain is owing to the extreme distention of the tunica vaginalis with fluid, a puncture to let this out is followed by striking and immediate relief Strapping the testicle is difficult to perform in a proper manner, but deserves more favor than it has received at the hands of sur- geons. The hardness of the testicle which is apt to remain ordinarily disappears of itself in a few weeks. Its departure may be hastened by keeping the testicle constantly in a suspender covered by oiled silk, so as to keep up heat and moisture. Mild mercurial ointment sometimes hastens the absorption. No internal medicine exerts much influence on the disease. Urethral injections should not be used, but other gonorrheal treat- ment may be continued, if called for. In syphilitic orchitis, a thorough anti-syphilitic treatment is demanded, including large doses of iodide of potassium. DR. ROBERTS BARTHOLOW, 499. 'Sf..

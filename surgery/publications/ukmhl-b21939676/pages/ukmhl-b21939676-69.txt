THE TREATMENT OF WOUNDS. The aim of the surgeon, when called upon to treat an open wound, is to bring about the repair of the tissues in the manner most conducive to the future welfare of the patient. Experience has not yet positively decided whether this can best be done by securing union by the " first intention," or by the slower process of granulation. The French surgeons, headed by the eminent Baron Larrey, believe that the latter more certainly avoids dan- gerous complications and sequelae, and leaves the cicatrix when healed less painful and less liable to annoy the patient. To some extent the English surgeons acknowledge this. Professor Hum- phrey has long advocated the encouragement of suppuration in wounds for the removal of cancer. He even retards the healine process by the insertion of issues, etc., believing that this tends to delay and prevent the return of the disease. Generally, however, both English and American surgeons pride themselves on the rapidity with which the wound heals; and their dressings are aimed to bring about union by the first intention, without perhaps suffi- ciently reflecting on the current and future dangers such success involves. Most of the dressings which will be mentioned in this chapter, therefore, have been devised with a view of inducing early healing. They are very various, and illustrate the wide differences of opinion among their originators.

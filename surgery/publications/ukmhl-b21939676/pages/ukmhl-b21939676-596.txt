For ulcerated surfaces and patches of rupia deprived of their scabs, these ointments may also be used, reduced to such propor- tion that their application does not cause pain. An excellent local effect upon ulcers may be often produced by sprinkling them with iodoform or black oxide of mercury, or calomel, alone or combined with oxide of zinc, or with the addition of a little cam- phor. When an ulcer is peculiarly indolent, indurated and chronic, new activity may be excited in it by packing it full of crystals of acetate of soda. The application produces considerable pain, last- ing often several hours, but it has an excellent effect in freshening up a sluggish surface. Solution of chloral, gr.v to aquae f Sj, may also be used with advantage. Lint, soaked in this solution, is packed into the ulcer. For mucous and scaly patches of the mouth, the patient should be instructed to cease using tobacco and to touch the spots once or twice a day with a smooth lump of sulphate of copper.

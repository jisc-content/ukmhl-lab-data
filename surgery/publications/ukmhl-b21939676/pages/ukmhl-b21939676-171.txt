It should be remembered that fluids effused into the peritoneal and pleural sacs are decidedly the most virulent. PROFESSOR THEODOR BILLROTH. For the first treatment of the part poisoned with cadaveric mat- ter, this author advises that cold water be let run on the wound for a long time, and not to check the bleeding, if there is any. From a considerable experience on himself and his students, he considers cauterization immediately after contact not advisable. But if later the parts around the wound redden, the part may be cauterized with nitrate of silver or fuming nitric acid. This is very painful, but it acts well. Not unfrequently pus forms again under the slough ; in this case, the slough must be removed, and the spot again cauterized; and this is to be repeated until no more pus forms under the slough. Should lymphangitis begin, the arm should first of all be placed on a splint to keep it quiet, and the appropriate treatment for lym- phangitis be instituted. If indurated lymphatic glands remain after infection with cadav- eric poison, daily warm baths are the best means for promoting the excretion of the poison. DR. THOMAS H. TANNER, After the first attention to the wound, according to usual surg- ical principles in such cases, the physician must attend to the inflammation of the tissues and absorbents, and the asthenic symp- toms which follow.

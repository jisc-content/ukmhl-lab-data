272 LESIONS OF THE ORGANS OF DIGESTION. APHTHAE AND STOMATITIS. JAMES E. GARRETSON, M. D., D. D. S. Occurring in connection with acute diseases, aphthse usually disappear with the condition which excited them; but appearing in connection with dyscrasic diseases (see Chapter XV.), they often give the practitioner the greatest anxiety and trouble. Acute aphthae, as manifested in cancrum oris, gangmena oris, and follicular inflammation, demand the most attentive local treat- ment. Alterative and soothing applications are what are required, as: 327. Cupri sulphatis, gr.v-xxx Aquae, ^-^j- For a lotion ; an excellent application. Or, 328. I^. Tincturse ferri chloridi, f.3j Quinise sulphatis, gr.xxv. To apply to the parts. Or: 329. ^. Pulv. cinchonse rubrae, Cretae precipitatae, Acidi tannici, ^â€¢ For a powder to be dusted over the parts. Hydrochloric acid, applied by means of a feather or small brush, causes less pain than might be supposed, and is thought by many to be the very best local application that can be employed. Combined with these applications are to be employed the more soothing means. Starch, gum and slippery elm water are very serviceable. Tincture of hamamelis, much diluted, is a good prep- aration. Another is the phenate of soda. The bowels should be kept laxative, by oil, the saline cathartics or aloes. The neutral mixture of lemonade is useful in inflamma- tory conditions. For the diarrhoea frequently seen a combination like the following is suitable : 3-0. I^. Hydrargyri cum creta, gr-ij ^ ' Pulveris opii Pulveris ipecacuanhae, aa gr.j Magnesiae carbonatis, gr.xij- Make twelve powders. One of these, for an infant, every two hours.

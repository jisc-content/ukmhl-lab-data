REYISED AND ENLARGED BY THE AUTHOR. 1 vol. 8vo, pp. 307. "With numerous illustrations and a large chart. Price, cloth, $3.00, This -work, written by one of the most eminent of the younger European ophthalmologists^ and translated by a distinguished specialist of this country, is a concise yet comprehensive descrip- tion of the methods of examining the different parts and functions of tlie eye. While full enough for the specialist, it will enable the general practitioner to diagnose the condition of the organ and determine whether the services of an oculist are needed or not. It is, indeed, especially designed to- meet this purpose. While It is not wearisome In detail, It takes in the whole subject and treats It in a manner as thorough as It Is simple. Progress is being constantly made In this branch of the science, and this work represents It down to the time of going to press. It takes in the whole field: examination of the exterior of the eye; movements of the eyes—including strabismus, determination of the acuteness of vision, its refraction and accommodation; the perception of colors; the visual field, and ophthalmoscopy. There is a large chart appended to the volume, showing the physiological and pathological movements of the eyes. A simple examination of the chart will show at once which muscle is affected in a paresis affecting the eye, thus rendering one of the most difficult diagnoses compara- tively easy.

(487) XV. THE TREATMENT OF SCROFULA. PROFESSOR S. D. GROSS, OF PHILADELPHIA. This writer observes that few practitioners really understand the nature of strumous diseases. They seem not to know that they occur under the most varied forms, and that the trektment must be varied to meet each case. For practical purposes it is sufficient to consider scrofulous patients divided into two great classes, the vigorous and the weak. The former are no doubt in the minority, but are nevertheless a well marked and not infrequent class. As a general rule it is well to begin the treatment with a mild yet efficient aperient, to clear out the bowels and improve the se- cretion. After this, if the patient is feeble and exhausted, a tonic course should be instituted ; but if, on the other hand, he is strong and plethoric, as denoted by the state of his pulse and complex- ion-, much time will be gained and structure saved, by the use of antiphlogistics, especially tartar emetic and Epsom salts, in the* form of the saline and antimonial mixture (F. 5), properly guarded with tincture of opium. While the lancet must be employed with great care. Dr. Gross is satisfied that it is often of immense bene- fit in arresting the morbid action. In scrofulous inflammation of the eye, throat and lymphatic glands, its effects are often marked and permanent. But these active measures must ere long in the case be superseded by other remedies, similar to those gen- erally applicable in the more common form of the disease. Among these, iodine may be regarded as the most important. When a purely alterative effect is desired, it is best given in the form of lugol's concentrated solution. 704. lodinii, 9j.

285 TONSILLITIS (quinsy, CYNANCHE), ration, and then a simple alum gargle may be serviceable. The advantages of the plan are: i. The carbolic acid relieves pain, checks hawking and tickling of the throat, and sweetens the foul breath. 2. The glycerine keeps moist the dry irritated mucous membrane. 3. The hot gargle, the fomentations, and the foot- bath rapidly relieve the active congestion. GARGLES. In inflammations of the fauces, tonsils and pharynx, an im- portant method of medication is by the use of gargles. A gargle should be used in small quantities and frequently. One or two teaspoonfuls is abundant, and it should be repeated hourly or every half hour. Sir J. Murray recommends the drawing of the gargle through the nostrils. It thus passes along the posterior nares and reaches the pharynx, touching in its course the whole mucous surface. Conditions such as injected, relaxed or turgid states of the coats and vessels of the posterior passages, which cannot be reached by gargles applied in the usual manner, are removed by those drawn through the nostrils. Gargles maybe made either astringent, stimulant or sedative. They are contra-indicated when active inflammation of the throat exists. They are purely local in their action, and are pow- erfully employed in chronic cases of relaxed or ulcerated tonsils and fauces.

CONJUNCTIVAL DISEASES (OPHTHALMla). 4I3 Given a typical case of granular conjunctivitis with pannus: he everts the upper and lower eyelids, and, with Desmarre's scarifica- tor, makes free incisions into the conjunctiva of the eyelids, including the cul-de-sac. The incisions are only so deep as to allow free exit to the deposits, without encroaching on the tarsal- surface; and with the finger he gradually squeezes out the gran- ules. The surfaces being sponged with warm water to encourage bleeding, a Solution of atropine is applied to the part, followed up with a borax lotion in warm water three times a day. Two days afterwards the eyelids are again everted, and the syrup of tannin poured upon them. 591. R.

The scarifica- tion is again resorted to in a fortnight or three weeks later, accord- ing to the exigencies of the case ; but the syrup of tannin and friction are applied every second or third day. By these means the granulations are gradually got rid of, and the thckiening and corneal pannus disappear, the cornea gradually recovering its transparency. DR. A. M. ROSEBURGH, SURGEON TO THE TORONTO EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY. In simple catarrhal conjunctivitis this surgeon directs the eye to be bathed frequently, and simple cerate to be applied to the edge of the eyelid at bed-time. A solution of atropia (gr.ij) applied occasionally to the conjunctiva will reveal, by its effect on the shape of the pupil, whether the iris is involved or not. This answers for the first week. In the second week the use of local applications should begin ; either: 592. 'Sf.. Hydargyri oxidi rubri, gr.viij Glycerini amyli, Or: 593.

The conium leaves, which should be fresh, are boiled over a slow fire, in the lard, until they become friable, and then filter. This pomade is to be employed in frictions on cancerous tumors, at the same time that stramonium is given internally. If fresh conium leaves cannot be obtained, the pomade may be made with the extract of conium and lard. MR. CAMPBELL DE MORGAN. This London surgeon first used chloride of zinc in cases of can- cer, with the idea that the frequency of the return of the disease after operating was due to the remains of its germs on its cut sur- face ; and he hoped that the application of chloride of zinc to the wound would destroy any cancer-germs that might be scattered over it, and thus diminish the chance of recurrence. His prescription was: 680. R. Zinci chloridi, gr.xl Aqus. f.Sj. M. With this he freely washed the surface of the wound after oper- ating. ■M. MAISEONNEUVE, OF PARIS.

Make into a paste. The arrows are formed by rolling this paste into cakes, which are then •to be divided into strips of any desirable shape or size; then by drying they may be made to assume any desired degree of firmness or tenacity. Maisonneuve uses the arrows in three forms: i. Conical, for circular cauterization; 2. Lance-shaped, for cauterization in parallel lines ; 3. Spindle-shaped, for central cau- terization. When used, they are introduced into the body of the tissue, so as to effect the destruction from tvithin outzvard. If the tissues are soft, the arrows will penetrate them; if not, a passage must be made with a scalpel. This can usually be done without loss of blood if the arrow fills the wound completely.

LESIONS OF MUSCULAR TISSUE. 2lS be followed. The retention of the part has the following advan- tages, viz: I. A moderately,useful finger is preserved. 2. The symmetry and appearance of the hand is not as much altered as in amputation. 3. By retaining the pacinian corpuscles the tactile function is intact, a matter of importance in the following of many pursuits in life. 4. The great disadvantage is the length of time the parts take to granulate. Dr. Gross observes: " Dead bone is removed as soon as it is easily separable, the periosteum being as little interfered with as possible, and amputation always avoided, experience having shown that a new phalanx is sometimes formed, and even when this does not happen the boneless finger will be both useful and sufficiently seemly." ULCERS. The neglect of the constitutional treatment of ulcers is not unfre- quently the cause of their obstinate continuance in spite of the most appropriate local applications. In strumous subjects, the special treatment for scrofula is called for; in gouty, scorbutic, syphilitic constitutions, it is vain to expect the part to heal unless the special dyscrasia is likewise removed. Occasionally, where no cachexia is present, the administration of tinctnra opii, gtt. x-xx, thrice daily, has been found to favor remarkably the healing process. (Dr. J. B. Burnett, in the Med- ical and Surgical Repoi^ter, S&^gt, 1869.) Where there is general debility, the blood poor and the nutri- tion feeble, the following is employed at the Philadelphia Hospital as a general tonic : 251. Vf.. Tinct. ferri chloridi, f-5j Cinchonise sulphatis, gr-viij Strychniae, g^'-X Syrupi Aquae, aa f.^j. M. A teaspoonful for a dose. Mr. Croft, of St. Thomas' Hospital, London, has called atten- tion to the value of quinine, in full doses, in serpiginous and phag- edenic ulcers. He gives as much as gr. viij, with potassii iodidi

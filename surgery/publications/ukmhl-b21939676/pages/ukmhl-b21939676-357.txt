The linen so moistened is laid around the glans, leaving the apex and meatus uncovered ; and finally, the prepuce is pulled forward to its natural position. This dressing is to be repeated twice to four times daily, according to the amount of the dis- charge. In some cases the prepuce cannot be retracted : in this event, its ciil de sac should be thoroughly washed out with tepid water by means of a syringe with a flat nozzle, every two or three hours; and each time after the cavity has been cleaned, a mild solution of carbolic acid, or enough of any of the lotions above mentioned to distend the prepuce, should be gently thrown in, retained a moment, and then allowed to escape. If they cause smarting, their strength should be reduced. In case the prepuce is much inflamed, rest, position and evapor- ating lotions locally, should be used in addition to the above meas- ures. If the inflammation runs so high that sloughing of the pre- puce appears imminent, it is better to relieve the tension by slitting up the dorsum ; but if chancroid be present, inoculation of the wound is inevitable, and the operation should be postponed to the last moment. In chronic and inveterate balanitis, or where constant relapses follow insignificant causes, circumcision affords a certain cure. All the unhealthy thickened inner layer of the prepuce should be re- moved.

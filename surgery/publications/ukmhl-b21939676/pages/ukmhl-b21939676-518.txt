This writer attaches much importance to mercurial plaster in many skin diseases: 739. 1^- Hydrargyri, fnj Olei terebinthinse, f^iss Emplastri plumbi, §xij. M. Of this he says it is most commonly used in the treatment of syphilides. In hard chancre it is the best local application, and can be conveniently used when spread on linen and wound round the penis. It is very useful in enlargement of the inguinal glands previous to the formation of an abcess. It is indicated in squam- ous and ulcerated forms of cutaneous syphilides, when its value may be shown b}'- covering one portion of the affected skin with the plaster and leaving the other exposed, when it will be found that the former soonest recovers. It is very advantageously ap- plied to the condylomata of children, and in psoriasis. It is also useful in chronic non-syphilitic skin affections, especially sycosis, acne indurata and lichen. Of other mercurial preparations, he especially commends the following: UNGUENTUM HYDRARGYRI AMMONIATI COMPOSITUM, 740. I^.

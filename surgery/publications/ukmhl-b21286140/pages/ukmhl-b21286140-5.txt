In a few instances a narrow bright halo surrounding the macula region has been described and depicted. In all these pictures the halo (if shown at all) is represented as an oval with a long axis horizontal or slightly oblique (from I0°-I5° to the horizon). All text-books state that it is diffi- cult to see the macula at all, and some of those works which refer to the halo state that it can only be observed in chil- dren, and that only when the pupil is undilated by a mydriatic, under which condition, as above stated, it appears as an oval ring. It is remarkable that, in spite of the most diligent search, I cannot find a single author in the whole range of ophthal- mological literature who mentions the macula as appearing round when observed ophthalmoscopically. It is true Schmidt-Rimpler describes the macula, examined anatomi- cally, in enucleated eyes, as being usually circular, but when Reprinted from the Archives of Ophthalmology, Vol. xxi., No. i, 1892.

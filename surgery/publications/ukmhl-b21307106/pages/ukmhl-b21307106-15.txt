Poupart’s ligament, which, together with n, Gimbernat’s ligament, con- stitutes the crural arch; beneath which, the iliacus muscle r, the psoas mag- nus muscle s, the anterior crural nerve t, the femoral artery u, the femoral vein v, and the crural ring x, are situated.f The femoral artery and vein, with the crural ring, are seen included within a membranous sheath or com- mon investment, *, the anterior wall of which is formed by the fascia trans- versals, and the posterior by the fascia iliaca. On each side of the femoral vein will be perceived a membranous septum which separates that vessel from the femoral artery on the one side, and from the crural ring on the other, at the same time serving to bind the anterior and posterior parietes of f The femoral hernia descends from the abdomen through the crural ring.

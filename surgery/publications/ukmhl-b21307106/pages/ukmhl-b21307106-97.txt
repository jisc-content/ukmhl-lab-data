TUMOURS IN THE GROIN. 153 CHAPTER V. OF SOME OF THE DISEASES WHICH FREQUENTLY OCCUR IN THE GROIN. Bubo.—This term is sometimes restricted, though impro- perly so, to the swelling which is produced by an inflammatory enlargement of one of the lymphatic glands in the groin in con- sequence of venereal ulcerations, or discharges affecting the ex- ternal organs of generation, since these glands may swell and inflame from many other causes, independently of any syphilitic taint. The venereal bubo, when it follows the presence of a chancre upon any part of the penis, has its seat commonly in one of the superficial lymphatic glands which lie parallel with, and upon Poupart’s ligament. (See Plate I. fig. 10.) The longer diame- ter of the swelling is directed transversely to that of the limb ; and its situation, which is exactly in the bend of the thigh, ex- plains the great pain and difficulty which are experienced by the patient on walking, or using any similar exercise. A swelling of one of these glands may be caused by a simple gonorrhoea, but then it seldom proceeds to suppuration. The glands which lie alongside of the great saphena vein (Plate I. fig. 11.) frequently inflame and become swollen in con- sequence of ulcers or some similar source of irritation situated lower down upon the limb ; as, for example, between the toes, upon the ancle, heel, and lower part of the leg and thigh. The inflammation, which is at first situated in the lymphatic vessels and one of the absorbent glands, may become diffused by extend- ing itself to the surrounding cellular and adipose tissue, and ter- minate in a large and deep abscess of the groin. These glands are also occasionally found to become enlarged from disease about the anus, and the perinseal and glutseal regions, which should be removed before we can expect much benefit to follow the application of remedies to the swelling itself. In all these cases the long diameter of the tumour is parallel with the course

OF THE FEMORAL VESSELS. 121 1. The trunk of the common femoral artery. 2. The trunk of the common femoral vein. 3. The crural canal, through which the sac of a femoral hernia is protruded from the cavity of the abdomen. 4. The superficial femoral vein. 5. The superficial femoral artery. It is just below the situa- tion of this figure that the ligature is placed upon this vessel, in the modern operation, originally recommended by Scarpa as an improvement upon the method of John Hunter. 6. The saphena major vein, which, after receiving the anterior saphena, joins itself with the common femoral vein a little below Poupartâ€™s ligament. 7. The external circumflex artery, which is here given off by a common trunk with the profunda femoris. 8. A branch of the external circumflex artery, supplying the sartorius and tensor vaginae muscles. 9. The external pudic artery, which in this instance arose from the femoral artery several inches lower down than usual. 10. The iliac portion of the fascia lata, which had covered the vessels, reflected downwards and outwards. 11. The superficial epigastric artery cut across. 12. The umbilicus. A femoral hernia descends in the innermost of the three com- partments into which the funnel-shaped sheath of the fe- moral vessels is subdivided : this has already been described as the crural canal, and contains naturally some loose cel- lular tissue and lymphatic vessels, with occasionally an ab- sorbent gland.

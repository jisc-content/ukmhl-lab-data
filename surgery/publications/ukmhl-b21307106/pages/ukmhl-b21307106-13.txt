THE CRURAL ARCH. 85 G 3 No. l. The wood-engraving represents the crural arch of the left side as it appears when all the soft parts, with the exception of the ligaments, have been dis- sected from the os innominatum. The irregularly curved line of the anterior margin of the bone is seen to be converted into a hollow outlet or passage by Poupart’s and Gimbernat’s ligaments, as they are stretched across in front of the excavated space, a. The anterior superior spinous process of the ilium. b. The spinous process or tuberosity of the os pubis, c. The angle of the os pubis; the space between b and c is the crista of the os pubis, d. The hori- zontal branch of the os pubis: superiorly, its margin is thin and sharp, and is named the pecten of the bone; inferiorly, it arches over the thyroid foramen, which is represented as being partially filled up by the obturator ligament. e. The ileo-pectineal eminence, which marks the junction of the os pubis and the ilium when the developement of the osseous system has been completed :■ it is against this prominence of the bone that the femoral artery may be se- curely compressed with the thumb, so as completely to arrest the current of the blood through the vessel, f. The anterior inferior spinous process of the ilium, to which one of the heads of the rectus muscle of the thigh is attached. g. The dorsum of the ilium, h. The thyroid foramen, partly closed up by the

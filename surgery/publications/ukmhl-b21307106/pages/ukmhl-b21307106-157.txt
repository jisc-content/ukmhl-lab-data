BY THE SAME AUTHOR, THE SURGICAL ANATOMY OF THE PERINEUM, illus- trated by Lithographic Plates and Wood-engravings. Royal 8vo. 6s. plain, 7s. 6d. coloured. “ A treatise which contains a variety of solid and useful information.—Lancet Feb. 2, 1839. “ It compresses the recent information, and is likely to be very serviceable to young surgeons.—Med. Chir. Revieiv, Jan. 1839. “ We have no hesitation in recommending this publication as likely to prove useful to students actually engaged in the schools, or to those who, having entered into practice, may find occasion to keep up or refresh their recollections of the anatomy of the perinseum.”—Edin. Med. and Surg. Journal, April, 1839- “ A work on the Anatomy of the Perinseum cannot be expected to offer much that is new in the description of this well-studied portion of the human body. To give the student the best information and directions as to his proceed- ings in the dissection of this region—the most accurate description in the sim- plest language — the detail in anatomy, as inseparably connected with the practice in surgery,—the latter giving importance to the former, and the former decision and safety to the latter,—is all that can be looked for, and all to be found here. The plates illustrating the letter-press are well drawn, and carefully en- graved, and show with great distinctness the parts to be represented ; that exhibiting the side-view of the pelvis is, we think, clearer and more to the matter than any we have seen before. We can conscientiously recommend the work ; and are glad to find that other equally important regions are about to be treated of by Mr. Morton—we hope in the same simple and useful manner.” —Medical Gazette, May 25, 1839. WHICH, WITH 2. THE GROIN, FEMORAL, AND POPLITEAL REGIONS, 3. INGUINAL HERNIA, THE AXILLA, AND BEND OF THE ELBOW (preparing), 4. THE HEAD AND NECK (preparing), WILL FORM A TREATISE ON THE SURGICAL ANATOMY OF THE PRINCIPAL REGIONS OF THE HUMAN BODY. With numerous Lithographic Plates and Engravings on Wood. 1>

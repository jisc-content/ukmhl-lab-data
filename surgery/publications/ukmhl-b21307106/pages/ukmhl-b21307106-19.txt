91 SHEATH OF THE FEMORAL VESSELS. mit the great trunks of the lymphatic vessels of the lower ex- tremity into the interior of the abdomen. (See the woodcut No. 2, u, v, x.; and Plate IV. fig. 1, 2, 3.) The most ex- ternal of the subdivisions of the funnel-shaped sheath of the vessels contains the common femoral artery; the second, or middle division, is occupied by the great femoral vein; while the third, or that which is nearest to the tuberosity of the os pubis, corresponds with the crural ring, and is closed, in the natural condition of the parts, by some loose cellular tissue-f- and lymphatic vessels: occasionally, however, an absorbent gland will be found lying within it. It is into the last-mentioned of the three subdivisions of the funnel-shaped sheath of the femoral vessels that the peri ton seal pouch, which forms the sac of a femoral hernia, commences to descend when it is extruded from the abdominal cavity. t The Septum crurale of M.

t THE SURGICAL ANATOMY OF THE POPLITEAL REGION. The Popliteal Region, sometimes denominated the Ham, is a space of considerable extent situated behind the knee-joint, and may be described as including within its limits the lower third of the thigh, and the superior fourth of the leg. When the muscles of the back part of the leg and thigh have been dissected, the popliteal region presents a lozenge-shaped figure, (see Plate VIII,) which is divided into two unequal portions by a line carried transversely across the space, oppo- site the flexure of the knee-joint. The superior division of the region is a little larger than the inferior, for it extends as high as the point where the fleshy belly of the biceps flexor separates from the semi-tendinosus and semi-membranosus mus- cles, (with which it had previously lain in close apposition, from their common point of origin at the tuberosity of the ischium,) to descend obliquely outwards to its insertion into the head of the fibula. (See Plate VIII. fig. a.) The inferior portion of the space is, when viewed externally, of rather smaller ex- tent, as it is limited inferiorly by the junction with each other of the two heads of the gastrocnemius muscle. (See Plate VIII. figs. e,jf.) When regarded more deeply, the popliteal region extends from the triangular-shaped opening in the triceps adductor muscle, as far downwards as the inferior edge of the popliteus muscle.

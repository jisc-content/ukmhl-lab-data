VARIETIES OF FEMORAL HERNIA. 134- Section II. varieties of femoral hernia:. Besides tlic natural divisions of femoral liernise into those that are complete and incomplete, both of which are sufficiently frequent in their occurrence to be observed almost every day, there are yet other varieties which are much more rare, and de- serving of some notice here. M. Cloquet possesses a preparation in which the deep epi- gastric artery is seen to run along the inner border of the sac of a femoral hernia which had descended in front of the great fe- moral vessels.-)* Hesselbach mentions an instance in which the sac had de- scended behind the crural arch, in the interval between the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium and the great vessels. In this case the fundus of the sac lay beneath the iliac portion of the fascia lata, and its neck was crossed ante- riorly by the internal circumflex ilii artery. In another case, which is mentioned by the same author, the epigastric took its origin from the profunda femoris, and ran along the inferior and inter- nal border of the neck of the sac of a femoral hernia. Mr. Macil- wain, one of the surgeons to the City of London Truss Society, says that he has known of not less than six instances, which are recorded in the books of the society, in which the hernial sac was protruded upon the iliac side of the vessels.^ Mr. Stanley, surgeon to St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, has dissected two cases of femoral hernise, in which the sac descended from the abdo-. men, by the outer side of the femoral vessels, but close to them. In one of these instances, the epigastric artery arose from the fe- moral, and gave origin to the obturatrix artery. The common t “ L’artere dpigastrique peut se trouver en-dedans du sac de la hernie crurale; celle-ci descend alors au-devant des vaisseaux femoraux. Je ne possede qu’une seule observation de ce cas.”—Recherches Anatomiques sur les Hernies,page 85, proposition xlviii. \ Vide Macilwain on Hernia, p. 293.

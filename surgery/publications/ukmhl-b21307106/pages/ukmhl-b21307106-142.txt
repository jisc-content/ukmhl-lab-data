DISLOCATION ON THE DORSUM 1LII. 194 No. 7. which, however, must he of very rare occurrence, since Sir Astley Cooper states that lie has never seen an instance of it. 1. The dislocation upwards and outwards upon the dorsum ilii.—This dislocation is commonly produced by falls upon the side, while the thigh is bent forwards and inwards; so that the head of the femur is twisted outwards, and violently thrust against the superior and external part of the capsular ligament, which it tears through, and so slips upon the dorsum of the ilium above, and behind the acetabulum. In this dis- location there is a remarkable diminution in the length of the limb, which is an inch and a half, or two inches, shorter than on the sound side.— The knee is slightly ad- vanced in front of the other, and is inclined towards the lower part of the opposite thigh. The great toe rests upon the in- step of the other foot.

THE SURGICAL ANATOMY OF THE THIGH. CHAPTER I. DISSECTION OF THE GREAT VESSELS AND NERVES OF THE THIGH. As this dissection serves to illustrate the principal points connected with the surgical treatment of femoral and popliteal aneurism, wounds of the great vessels, and amputations of the thigh and leg, &c. especially when these operations are followed by secondary hemorrhage, it is desirable that it should be exe- cuted with great care and attention. The dissection which has already been made for the purpose of displaying the anatomy of femoral hernia has, in some measure, anticipated the present; but there will be found no difficulty in continuing it in such a manner as to allow of every desirable object relating to the above-mentioned subjects being obtained, without having re- course to a fresh limb. The cutaneous nerves of the anterior part of the thigh should be traced to their ultimate distribution previously to the dissec- tion of the fascia lata from the muscles upon the lower part. They are three, and not unfrequently more, in number; and are named external, middle, and internal cutaneous. 1. The external cutaneous nerve is a branch from the second and third division of the lumbar plexus, from which it descends obliquely upon the iliacus muscle, in its way to reach the crural arch; underneath which it passes, at a short distance from the

94 DISSECTION OF THE SUPERFICIAL FASCIA. lation with the subjacent surface of the ulcer; which, unless this were done, would obstinately resist all other endeavours to heal it. Well-applied pressure, by means of a graduated com- press and the spica bandage, is worthy of being tried in the treatment of old and obstinate ulcerations of the groin. In scrofulous subjects we frequently meet with cases in which, after an abscess in the groin has burst, or been opened, the sore is prevented from healing by the presence of a greatly swollen and indurated gland, which projects from the centre of the ulceration : when this occurs, it is better to destroy the gland by the repeated application of the potassa fusa, than to excise it with the knife ; the powerful stimulus of this caustic acts very beneficially upon the naturally indolent ulcer, and its use is not likely to be attended with the troublesome hemorrhage which occasionally follows the removal of a gland with the knife from a sore so closely situated over the course of the great femoral artery. All sinuses which burrow under the skin of the groin, and which frequently result from badly treated suppurations of the inguinal glands, should be freely laid open with the knife, unless they extend beneath important structures, such as the spermatic cord, the great vessels, &c. The skin of the groin is sometimes the seat of fungoid carci- noma, the treatment of which by the stronger caustics, such as the chloride of zinc, nitric acid, &c. can only be successful when it has been actively put in force during the very first commence- ment of the disease, and before it has extended itself much as regards either its surface or depth. The superficial fascia.â€”The subcutaneous layer of cellular tissue which is exposed by the dissection of the skin forms a part of the superficial fascia of the groin, which here consists of two distinct lamellm, between which are situated the cutaneous vessels, and a considerable number of lymphatic glands. If the subject be rather emaciated, this disposition of the lamellae of the superficial fascia may be very clearly demonstrated; but it becomes extremely difficult to show it upon those subjects in which the cellular tissue is much loaded with adipose substance, as the superficial fascia is then hardly distinguishable from the ordinary layer of subcutaneous adipose tissue, j* t In some persons, frequently females, the superficial fascia of the groin appears to be one or two inches in thickness, from the circumstance of so

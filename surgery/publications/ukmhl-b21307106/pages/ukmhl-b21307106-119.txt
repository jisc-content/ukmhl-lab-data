DISSECTION OF THE POPLITEAL REGION. 173 The liam or popliteal region is bounded superiorly, and externally, by the biceps (fig. a) ; and lower down by the ex- ternal condyle of the femur, the outer head of the gastrocnemius and the plantaris muscle (fig. /, + ); superiorly and internally by the semi-tendinosus, semi-membranosus, and gracilis muscles (figs, b, c, d) ; internally and inferiorly by the inner head of the gastrocnemius and the internal condyle (figs, e and g) ; pos- teriorly by the skin and fascia lata ; and anteriorly by the pos- terior flat surface of the lower third of the femur, the back part of the knee-joint, and the popliteus muscle. Occupied by a large quantity of adipose substance, it contains, in addition, the popliteal nerve, vein, and artery, with their branches, which are numerous, and of considerable importance (figs, h, i, k, £,and m). Dissection of the popliteal region.—The subject should be laid upon its face, with the lower limbs hanging down over the edge of the table ; if it should be required, the trunk of the sub- ject may be additionally elevated by placing a large block of wood underneath the belly.-f* The first incision, for the dissection of the popliteal region, may be made in a perpendicular direction, along the inner border of the limb, commencing about five inches above the knee-joint, and terminating about four inches below it; from each extremity of this incision another cut is to be made at right angles to it, and extended across, in a transverse direction, to the opposite border of the limb. When the flap of skin, which has been thus marked out, has been raised, with the subcutane- ous layer of adipose tissue (the superficial fascia of some writers), and reflected outwards, that portion of the fascia lata of the thigh which covers in the cavity of the ham will be exposed to view. In the popliteal region the fascia lata is extremely strong and resistant, being composed of numerous dense transverse fibres, which are greatly fortified by the aponeurotic expansions of the tendons of the ham-string muscles. The principal set of the fibres of this portion of the fascia lata run in an oblique direc- tion downwards and inwards, and are interwoven with numerous t Previously to commencing the dissection of the popliteal region, it is recommended that the veins should be injected with some coloured wax or tallow injection, which is easily done from pipes inserted into the posterior saphena vein, and the venae comites of the posterior tibial artery, as they are passing behind the ancles.

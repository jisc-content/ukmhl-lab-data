122 INTERNAL VIEW OF CHAPTER III. DISSECTION TO EXPOSE BY AN INTERNAL VIEW THE STRUC- TURE AND RELATIONS OF THE CRURAL RING. This is, perhaps, the most important of the dissections which it is necessary to make in order that a complete and accurate knowledge may be obtained of the surgical anatomy of femoral hernia; since the relative position of the great femoral vessels, and their more important branches, to the crural ring, and con- sequently to the neck of the sac of a femoral hernia, will be better understood by it than from any other view. For this purpose the parietes of the abdomen, together with the peri- tonaeum lining their internal surface, should be cut through by an incision carried from the crest of the ilium, a little distance beyond the anterior superior spinous process, to the linea alba, where it may terminate above the umbilicus; and thence in a vertical direction downwards to the symphysis of the pubes. The triangular-shaped flap thus marked out should be held up- wards and forwards, at the same time that the small intestines are removed from the cavity of the pelvis, so that the internal surface of the peritonaeum as it lines the iliac fossa may be more clearly seen. (See Plate V.) The peritonaeum presents a strongly marked depression im- mediately on the pubal side of the great external iliac vessels, as they are about to emerge upon the upper part of the thigh after passing underneath Poupartâ€™s ligament. This depression, or fossa, corresponds with the lower part of the external inguinal pouch, and, if the extremity of the forefinger be firmly pressed upon this point, the peritonaeum will gradually yield, and may be easily forced downwards for some way into the crural canal, so as to represent very closely the mode in which it is protruded before the intestines in cases of femoral hernia : with a little perseverance, the extremity of the finger may thus be

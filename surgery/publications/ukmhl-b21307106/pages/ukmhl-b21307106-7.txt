ADVERTISEMENT. The present publication is intended to form, with the Surgical Anatomy of the Perinaeum already published, part of a Work, which, when it shall have been completed, will con- tain a description of the Surgical Anatomy of some of the most important regions in the human body. The drawings, from which the lithographic plates have been engraved, were very carefully made after my own dissections ; as were also those from which the wood-engravings have been taken, with the exception of Nos. 4 and 5, which were accu- rately copied from similar plates in Hesselbachâ€™s Essay upon the Origin and Progress of Hemise. I take advantage of the present occasion gratefully to ac- knowledge my obligation to Sir Astley Cooper, who has kindly permitted me to copy the engravings which illustrate the description of the injuries of the hip-joint, from the plates relating to that subject in his Treatise on Dislocations and Fractures. THOMAS MORTON. University College, April 30, 1839.

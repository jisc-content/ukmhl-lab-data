Garrod, M.D , London, Lecturer on Materia Medica and Therapeutics in the Aldersgate School of Medicine. One Volume, octavo, with Diagrams on Wood, 12s. cloth. “ As a manual for Students, it is the best that lias yet appeared, and will be found to contain much matter well worthy of perusal by the practitioner.”—lianlcin's Report.] PHYSIOLOGY. MULLER'S ELEMENTS OF PHYSIOLOGY. Translated, with Notes, by William Baly, M.D, Steel Plates and very numerous Engravings on Wood. Two thick volumes, 8vo, 20s. each. “ We do, however, recommend it very strongly, and we have no hesitation in saying that it will supersede all other works as a Text Book for Lectures, and one of reference for students. It steers a middle course between the superficial brevity of many of our modem works, and the pleonastic and metaphysical jargon of Burdach.”—Med, Chir. Review, April, 1838. *** A Supplement to Volume II. will be published this year. WALSHE ON CANCER. THE NATURE AND TREATMENT OF CANCER. By W. H. Walshe, M.D., Professor of Pathological Anatomy in University College, Physician to University College Hospital, and to the Hospital for Consumption and Diseases of the Chest. One vol. 8vo, with Illustrations, 16s. “ A perusal of the work enables us to assure our readers, that it is one of the most valuable monographs that has ever issued from the British Medical Press.”—Dublin Medical Journal. “The chapter upon this most important subject (Treatment) is very full and complete. Dr. Walshe has taken great pains to examine the alleged virtues of almost every remedy and of every plan of medication that has been proposed.”—Medico-Chir. Review. DISEASES OE THE LUNGS. PHYSICAL DIAGNOSIS of DISEASES of the LUNGS. By W. H. Walshe, M.D. Foolscap 8vo, 6s. 6d. cloth. “ The treatise is one of extraordinary merit. Indeed we do not hesitate to say, that there exists in no language any work on the Physical Diagnosis of the Diseases of the Lungs, suited for students, so clear and precise, and at the same time so comprehensive and practical, as this.”—British and Foreign Medical Review. DRESSING AND BANDAGING. CUTLER'S SURGEON'S PRACTICAL GUIDE IN DRESSING AND IN THE METHODIC APPLICATION OF BAND- AGES. Second Edition. 100 Engravings on Wood. Foolscap 8vo, 6s. 6d. “ This appears to be a valuable little treatise. The author seems to have spared no pains in pro- curing correct descriptions of all the surgical apparatus at present employed in bandaging and dressing, both at home and abroad. He has given numerous illustrations in the form of well-executed woodcuts, and has altogether produced what we conceive to be a very useful, and by no means as extensive publication.”—Medical Gazette, Nov. 10, 1834.

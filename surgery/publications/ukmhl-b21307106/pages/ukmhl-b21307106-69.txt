m THE DEEP CRESCENTIC ARCH. concave, and supports the peritonaeum and subserous cellular tissue ; frequently, a small oval-shaped lymphatic gland will be found upon it. The inferior surface, on the contrary, is convex, and projects downwards into the crural canal. The septum crurale is traversed by the numerous lymphatic vessels which have already been described as ascending by the inner side of the great femoral vein from the inferior extremity to the cavity of the abdomen, where they terminate in the absorbent glands, which are situated on either side of the external iliac artery and vein. The deep crescentic arch.—This may be described as con- sisting of a band of tolerably strong tendinous fibres, which are situated under Poupart’s ligament; it appears to be form- ed, on the iliac side of the great vessels, by a connexion be- tween the fascia transversalis, and the tendinous origins of the obliquus internus and transversalis, with part of Poupart’s liga- ment ; and on the pubal side by the same fascia, in union with the conjoined tendons of these two muscles, as they descend to be inserted into the ileo-pectineal line behind Gimbernat’s liga- ment. There is a good deal of dissection to be made to show this deep arch as a distinct structure, and it may be very fairly cri- ticised as in some degree artificial. After having made the dissection of the tendinous aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle, and of the crural arch, as is usually recommended for the display of the structures connected with the anatomy of the inguinal canal, the flap of the tendon of the external oblique should, in the next place, be held up and dissected from the internal oblique muscle, as far down as the edge of Poupart’s ligament. The ligament is then to be divided into two laminae, by forcing the handle of the scalpel between the external and internal oblique muscles, where they are attached to the liga- ment : by pushing the handle of the knife towards the thigh, it will pass under the iliac portion of the fascia lata ; then, by moving it in a horizontal direction, between the os pubis and the ilium, the tendon of the external oblique muscle and the iliac portion of the fascia lata, (which are connected together through the medium of the superficial part of Poupart’s liga- ment,) will be completely separated from the parts underneath, so that the ligament will appear to be formed by them only. If the attachment of the aponeurosis and Poupart’s ligament to the

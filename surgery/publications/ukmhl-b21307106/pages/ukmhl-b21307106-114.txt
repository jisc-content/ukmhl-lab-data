LIGATURE OF THE FEMORAL ARTERY. 168 the sartorius muscle may be drawn a little to the external side of the wound, after which the sheath of the vessels, covered by a thin layer of fascia, will be exposed to view, when, a small portion of it being lifted up between the blades of the forceps, it may be opened to the extent of about an inch, so as to admit of the needle being safely carried round the artery, without in- jury to the vein or nerve which lie upon either side of the vessel. After the ligature has been tied, one of its ends should be cut off, to promote the immediate union of the sides of the wound. The edges of the incision should be brought together, with or without the use of sutures, as may be considered most expedient, so as to obtain, if possible, the cure of the greater part of the wound by the first intention. The operation of placing a ligature upon the common fe- moral artery.—To place a ligature upon the common femoral artery, between the lower border of the crural arch and the origin of the profunda, a small external incision will suffice, as the vessel lies almost subcutaneous in this part of its course. The patient is to be placed upon his back, and the thigh turned a little outwards, with the knee slightly bent; the surgeon, after having determined the situation of Poupart’s ligament, commences his first incision a few lines above it, and continues it downwards over the course of the artery for about two inches, when, taking the forceps in one hand, he dissects down to the vessel, cutting through the subcutaneous cellular tissue, and the iliac portion of the fascia lata, pushing aside any of the lymphatic glands which may present themselves, until the sheath of the vessels is exposed, which is next to be opened to a sufficient extent to enable him to carry the needle safely round the artery, which should be done in the direction of from within outwards. If it were to happen in this operation that any of the superficial arteries were divided, it would be proper, should the hemorrhage from it continue after the ligature had been placed upon the main trunk, between the origin of the vessel and the centre of the circulation, to endeavour to secure it in the ordinary way, by placing a ligature upon the bleeding orifice ; but, if this cannot be effected, another ligature must be placed upon the main trunk on the distal side of that part of the artery from which the wounded branch takes its origin. The ligature of the external iliac artery has been found a

DISSECTION OF TIIE FARTS CONNECTED WITH 92 CHAPTER II. SURGICAL DISSECTION OF THE PARTS CONNECTED WITH THE ANATOMY OF FEMORAL OR CRURAL HERNIA. For making the dissection of the structures which are con- nected with the anatomy of femoral hernia, a female subject should be selected; and one that is rather lean and attenuated will be found to be much more suitable for this purpose than one which is more corpulent, as it is very difficult to demon- strate upon the latter, in a clear and satisfactory manner, the numerous layers of fascise described in the best treatises upon this disease. Position of the subject.â€”The subject should be laid upon its back, and a moderately sized block of wood introduced un- derneath the loins : the thigh, upon which the dissection is in- tended to be made, is, in the next place, to be abducted and rotated outwards, with the knee a little bent, so that the leg and foot may rest upon their external surface. The first in- cision of the dissection should be commenced over the pro- minent crest of the ilium, a short distance from the anterior superior spinous process, and extended in a straight line, across the lower part of the belly, to a little above the symphysis pubis : from the termination of this first cut, let another be carried in a vertical direction downwards, along the inner border of the thigh half way to the knee; after which it may be made to incline with a gentle curve over the front of the thigh, and brought to a termination upon the outer aspect of the limb. (See the Plates I, II, and III.) The flap, which has been thus marked out, and consisting of the skin only, is now to be dis- sected carefully, by light touches of the scalpel, from the sub- jacent layer of cellulo-adipose substance, commencing the sepa- ration at the superior and internal angle, and continuing until the whole of it has been raised from its connexions; after which it may be thrown loosely over the external border of the thigh. (See Plates, I, II, and III.) The skin of the region of the groin is very thin and delicate in its texture, and is slightly covered by the hair extending

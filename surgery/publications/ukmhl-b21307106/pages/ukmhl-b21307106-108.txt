branches of tiie femoral artery. 162 nislies three or four others, which have been denominated the perforating arteries. The external circumflex artery runs transversely outwards, passing in front of the neck of the thigh-bone, between the rectus and crurseus muscles : it divides, near the outer edge of the femur, into numerous branches, some of which ascend un- derneath the rectus, sartorius, and tensor vaginae femoris mus- cles, and anastomose with the gluteal and circumflex ilii arteries ; others run transversely over the outer surface of the trochanter major near its base, and communicate with the branches of the sciatic and internal circumflex arteries ; while a third set, which are also the largest in size, descend obliquely between the rectus and crurseus muscles towards the knee-joint, where they inoscu- late with the articular branches of the popliteal artery. The internal circumflex artery, after its origin from the pro- funda, inclines suddenly backwards, and passes between the psoas and pectineus muscles, so as to reach the external obturator muscle, in front of which it gives off several branches, some of which communicate with those of the obturator artery; it also sends a small branch into the hip-joint, which enters through the cotyloid notch, to supply the synovial structures of that arti- culation. The continuation of the artery then winds round the neck of the femur to gain the interval between the quadratus and adductor magnus muscles, after which it soon divides into branches, which anastomose with those of the sciatic, gluteal, and external circumflex arteries. The branches of these arteries, and even the trunks them- selves, are sometimes injured in dislocations of the hip-joint, and fractures of the neck and superior third of the thigh-bone, givingrise to extensive extravasation of blood among the muscles of the upper part of the limb. The perforating arteries are three or four in number, and are so named from traversing, soon after their origin from the profunda, the fibres of the adductor brevis and magnus muscles ; these vessels divide at the posterior surface of the limb into numerous branches, which are distributed to the hamstring mus- cles, and also communicate with the sciatic and circumflex arte- ries superiorly, and inferiorly with the articular branches of the popliteal artery. The anastomotica magna is given off from the femoral artery,

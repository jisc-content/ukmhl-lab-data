DIAGNOSIS OF FEMORAL IIERNIA. 140 is increased in the erect posture, and receives an impulse upon coughing ; but its nature is quickly recognised by the facility with which the finger may be pressed into the vein, by the thinness of its coats, and, after it has been reduced, (the patient lying in the recumbent posture,) by the reappearance of the tu- mour as soon as he rises, although the finger is kept firmly applied to the crural ring, so as effectually to prevent any pro- trusion of the contents of the abdomen by that aperture. Last summer there was shown to me a well-marked case of this kind, in the wards of La Charite, in Paris, under the care of M. Vel- peau ; but, as that surgeon remarked, it was impossible for any properly educated person, who paid the slightest attention to the characteristic appearances of the affection, to be deceived as to its actual nature. An instance of this varicose condition of the saphena and femoral veins, at their junction with each other, was met with in the dissecting-rooms of the College this winter. The tumour was of the size of a pigeon’s egg. Adipose and encysted tumours, occupying the situation of the bend of the thigh, have been mistaken for femoral hernia, as happened in the case which is recorded by Desault, and in an- other mentioned by Mr. Macilwain.j* The history of the case, the fluctuation which is perceptible in the tumour, and its situation, which is commonly upon the iliac side of the femoral vessels, will always be sufficient to enable a surgeon to distinguish psoas abscess from a femoral hernia.;]: ■\ Vide Desault’s Chirurgical Journal, tom. i. p. 252; and Macilvvain’s Surgical Observations, p. 314. t Mr. Cooper mentions having seen a case of psoas abscess which had been mistaken by another practitioner for a femoral hernia.

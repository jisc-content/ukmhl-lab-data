EXTENT OF THE REGION OF TIIE GROIN. S2 deep linear depression which marks, externally, the flexure of the thigh upon the pelvis. Preliminary remarks.—Before commencing the dissection of the groin, the following inequalities of its surface are deserving of notice; viz. at its most external limit is situated the strik- ing prominence of the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium, to which the sartorius muscle and the iliac extremity of the crural arch are attached ; beyond this, the projecting curved line of the crest of the ilium may be traced for a con- siderable distance until it ceases at the posterior superior spinous process: more internally than the anterior superior spine of the ilium is observed a smooth plain surface, which corre- sponds with the iliac portion of the fascia lata, where it covers the iliacus, psoas magnus, and rectus muscles ; next to it is a hollow depression, more or less strongly marked according to the condition of the subject, whether it be corpulent or other- wise ; it is occupied by a quantity of loose cellular and adipose substance, together with numerous lymphatic glands, underneath which, in the living person, the pulsations of the great femoral artery may be readily distinguished, as that vessel emerges from the cavity of the abdomen, passing underneath Poupart’s liga- ment.*f* It is in this situation that the interruption to the circulation of the blood through the trunk of the common femoral artery can be most easily effected, by the simple pressure of the thumb upon it as it runs over the horizontal branch of the os pubis, since it is only separated from that bone by a few of the fibres of the psoas magnus muscle.;]: (See the woodcut No. 2, at page 87, figs, e, s, and u.) f To be well acquainted with the natural healthy appearance of the upper part of the thigh, will frequently prove of great advantage in the endeavour to establish a ready and correct diagnosis in several of the numerous obscure affections which occur in the region of the groin. X In the hospital of University College, and in the French hospitals gene- rally, it is the constant practice to employ pressure in this manner upon the trunk of the common femoral artery, during the performance of amputation of the thigh or leg, instead of using the tourniquet; but in private practice, and on other occasions when a sufficient number of intelligent and trust- worthy assistants are not at hand, it is more advisable to take advantage of the security which the application of the tourniquet affords.

101 OF THE REGION OF THE GROIN. Some of these arteries are very liable to be wounded in the operation of placing a ligature upon the common trunk of the fe- moral artery, if the edge of the knife be carried too freely upon the sides of the vessel preparatory to passing the needle around it. In such a case, as the hemorrhage is usually pretty smart, and continues even after the trunk has been tied above, another ligature should be placed below the point from which the wounded vessel has its origin, unless, indeed, the open mouth of the bleeding artery can be secured in the ordinary way. In addition to the branches of the common femoral artery that have been just described, there are numerous smaller arte- ries, which issue from the saphenous aperture, or through other foramina that exist in the iliac portion of the fascia lata, and are distributed to the lymphatic glands of the inguinal region and the circumjacent cellular substance; but they are too insignificant in their size, and inconstant in tlieir course and distribution, to deserve any farther notice. Nerves.—The cutaneous coverings of the Region of the groin are supplied with nerves from the descending branch of the genito-crural, as well as by some filaments which arc derived from the anterior crural and ilio-inguinal branches of the lumbar plexus. The superficial vessels and lymphatic glands rest upon the deep lamella of the superficial fascia of the groin.— It will have been observed, in the course of the dissection, that the ab- sorbent glands, lymphatics, and superficial vessels are not in im- mediate contact with the fascia lata, above which they are situat- ed, but that they are separated from it by a thin stratum of loose cellular substance, which is interposed between them ; this may be described as forming the deep lamella of the superficial fascia of the groin. It extends upwards as high as to the anterior and inferior margin of Poupart’s ligament, to which it is attached; it will be found to be a little thicker in some subjects than in others. It is in consequence of the yielding and extensible nature of the deep lamella of the superficial fascia, that the swellings which result from the enlargement of any of the inguinal glands, as in cases where buboes have formed, are so readily moved upon their bases by lateral pressure, and even allow of the tips of the fingers being pressed in underneath them, so as to lift them up, as it were, from the fascia lata of the thigh, upon which

7 28, Upper Gower Street. PROFESSOR LIEBIG’S WORKS. RESEARCHES ON THE CHEMISTRY OE FOOD. By Justus Liebig, M.D., Professor of Chemistry in the Univei’sity of Giessen. Edited from the Author’s MS. by William Gregory, M.D., Professor of Chemistry in the University of Edinburgh. 8vo, 5s. 6d. cloth. n. FAMILIAR LETTERS ON CHEMISTRY, AND ITS RE- LATIONS TO COMMERCE, PHYSIOLOGY AND AGRICULTURE. By Justus Liebig, M.D., Professor of Chemistry in the University of Giessen. Edited by John Gardner, M.D., Member of the Chemical Society. Third Edition. Fcap. 8vo, 4s. 6d. “ That the public -will discover its merits, and that it will find its way into the drawing-room as well as the library, and be equally prized by the advanced man of science and the student, we venture to say is certain; and it must increase the respect entertained for Chemistry wherever it is read.”— Chemical Gazette. III. FAMILIAR LETTERS ON CHEMISTRY, Second Series. THE PHILOSOPHICAL PRINCIPLES AND GENERAL LAWS OF THE SCIENCE. By Justus Liebig, M.D., Professor of Chemistry in the University of Giessen. Edited by John Gardner, M.D. Foolscap 8vo, 5s. “ The plan of the Letters is as simple and intelligible as their style. The Author sets out with a general consideration of Chemistry; and of the rank to which it is entitled among the other sciences; treats shortly of chemical affinity and chemical equivalents, illustrating the symbols and formulae by which these affinities are expressed; explains the atomic theory; considers the relations of heat, light, electricity, and gravity to chemical force, and shows wherein these forces differ from, what has been called the vital principle; and lastly discusses the transformations—fermentation, putrefaction, and decay—which take place in organic bodies when removed from the influence of vitality.”— Chambers’ Journal. IV. CHEMISTRY IN ITS APPLICATIONS TO AGRICUL- TURE AND PHYSIOLOGY. By Justus Liebig, M.D., Pli.D., F.R.S., Professor of Chemistry in the University of Giessen. Edited, from the MS. of the Author, by Lyon Playfair, Ph. D., and William Gregory, M.D. Fourth Edition, revised. 8vo, 10s. 6d. cloth. v. ANIMAL CHEMISTRY; or, CHEMISTRY IN ITS Ap- plications TO PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY. By Justus Liebig, M.D., Ph. D., Professor of Chemistry in the University of Giessen. Edited, from the Author’s Manuscript, by William Gregory, M.D., Pro- fessor of Chemistry in the University of Edinburgh. Third Edition, almost wholly re-written. ,8vo. Part I. (the first half of the work) 6s. 6d. cloth, just published. “ Under the heads of animal heat; of the nutrition of the carnivora and herbivora; of the origin and use of the bile; of the relation between the change of matter and the consumption of oxygen; of the origin and use of the non-nitrogenised elements of food, and particularly of fat, and their relative value as sources of heat; of the effects of alcohol and fermented liquors; of the effects produced on the volume of the inspired air by the different articles of food; and lastly, of the true functions of the in- testinal canal, and the origin, nature, and composition of the faeces, with their relation to the food, and to the supply of oxygen; under all these heads, the reader will find such an amount of new and inte- resting matter as must satisfy him that we have entered on the true paih of discovery, and that the industry of modem chemists has been most profitably employed during the period which has elapsed since the first edition of this work appeared.”—From the Editor’s Advertisement.

143 STRANGULATED FEMORAL HERNIA. duce, at all risks, the contents of a strangulated hernia, rather than to have recourse to the knife. When the abdomen is swollen, and there is tenderness of it and of the tumour under pressure, the taxis should not be persevered in ; but immediate recourse had to the operation with the knife, which the history of surgery amply proves to be followed by success, in exact proportion to the gentleness and short duration of the efforts previously em- ployed in the attempt to reduce the strangulated intestine by the taxis.'}' The taxis sometimes succeeds, although it may have failed a short time before, after the exhibition of such active remedies as are well known to reduce the vascular action and muscular tone of the individual to whom they arc administered ; these are the hot bath, free venesection, tartar emetic,:]: and the tobacco enema ; all other remedies are of very little avail, and therefore need scarcely ever be employed in cases of acute stran- gulated femoral hernia. Section Y. THE OPERATION FOR STRANGULATED FEMORAL HERNIA. The taxis, aided as it may have been by the hot bath, &c. having been fairly tried, and the hernia still remaining unredu- ced, it is of the utmost importance that the operation for the re- moval of the stricture upon the strangulated bowel should be de- layed no longer; for it is very generally admitted, if it be not completely proved, that a fatal amount of injury is much earlier inflicted upon the tunics of the intestine by the stricture in cases of femoral hernise, than in any other kind of rupture. Sir Astley Cooper mentions, in his work on hernia, two cases ; in one of which death occurred in eight hours, and, in the other, in twenty- one hours from the commencement of the symptoms : although he says, at the same time, that he has known the operation to have succeeded when it has been performed as long as eight days f Vide the works of Desault, Richter, Pott, Hey, Velpeau, Lawrence, and many other equally distinguished surgeons, who are unanimous in de- precating violent and long-continued attempts to reduce strangulated her- nias by the taxis. t A considerable number of cases of strangulated hernia have been suc- cessfully treated in the hospital of the College, by prefacing the taxis with nauseating doses of tartar emetic : of course, if vomiting be produced, the ac- tion of the abdominal muscles might be productive of much harm ; the doses of this medicine should therefore be very moderate.

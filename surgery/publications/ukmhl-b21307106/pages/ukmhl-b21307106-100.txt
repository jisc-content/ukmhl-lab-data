15G HYDATID TUMOUR. iliac fossa are, in most cases, similarly affected. The glands of tlie groin frequently become diseased secondarily in malignant affections of the lower extremity; and lienee it is riglit to ascer- tain tlieir condition by a careful examination before any opera- tive procedure, sucli as amputation, is performed for the re- moval of the primary disorder.-j- Hydatid tumour.—The celebrated Desault relates the case of a girl from whose groin he removed a hydatid tumour, for which she had been advised by several other surgeons to wear a truss. J: In another instance, which is mentioned by Dr. Monro, a sac of the size of an egg, which contained within it a quantity of hy- datids, was removed from the upper and inner part of the thigh, where it might be readily mistaken for a hernia, as the hydatids contain a watery fluid, have thin and elastic coats which com- municate to the touch nearly the same kind of sensation as a protruded portion of intestine, and are contained within a covering very similar to a hernial sac.§ t Dr. Warren relates the case of a lady in whom the glands of the groin were affected with scirrhus.—Surg.

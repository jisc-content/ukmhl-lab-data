By Edward Andrew Parnell, Author of “ Applied Chemistry in Arts, Manufactures, and Domestic Economy.” Second Edition, revised throughout, and enlarged by the addition of 200 pages. 8vo, 14s. cloth. The enlargement of the present edition is principally caused by the introduction of a much fuller account of the different re-agents, by an amplification of the part on qualitative analysis, and by the introduction of several important processes for the analysis, or valuation of various articles of com- merce, such as akalies, ores of manganese, copper, lead, and other metals; bleaching powder, guano, and similar manures, saltpetre, etc. The work includes an account of the use of the mouth blowpipe in analysis, the detection of poisons in organic mixtures, the qualitative analysis of urine, and discrimination of urinary calculi, and the operations of organic analysis.

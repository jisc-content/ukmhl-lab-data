THE SURGICAL ANATOMY OF THE GROIN. CHAPTER I. EXTENT OF THE REGION OF THE GROIN. PRELIMINARY REMARKS. The groin, or, as it has been more recently termed, the in- guino-femoral region, comprises within its limits the triangular space or hollow which is observed at the upper part of the thigh where it bends upon the trunk, and is included between the ligament of Poupart above, and the sartorius and adductor longus muscles on either side. This space, the external surface of which is usually a little concave in its outline, especially when, in the living subject, the thigh is attempted to be flexed upon the pelvis, or when, after death, it is abducted and rotated outwards, may be compared in several respects to the depression of the axilla in the upper extremity. This hollow appearance of the region of the groin is extremely well seen in those per- sons who, originally possessed of a large muscular develope- ment, have become rapidly emaciated in consequence of some wasting disease, as hectic, fever, &c. ; but in very corpulent individuals the natural limits of the region are not so clearly marked out, nor can it be easily distinguished from the general contour of the limb, unless the muscles which bound it laterally are excited to a violent degree of contraction. The base of the triangular space is, as has been already described, formed by Poupartâ€™s ligament, and therefore corresponds exactly with the G

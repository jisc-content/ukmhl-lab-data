EXTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY. 171 Cooper ; but this advantage, if it do really exist, which is sub- ject to dispute, is counterbalanced by the greater risk of wound- ing the peritoneeum, which is much more extensively disturbed in the former than in the latter operation. As a rule, the ligature should be placed, in either operation, at such a distance above the origin of the epigastric artery, (for example, about an inch,) as will permit of sufficient space for the formation of a coagulum, and thus diminish the possibility of secondary he- morrhage occurring, when the ligature separates from the artery. After the ligature of the external iliac artery, the collateral circulation of the limb is principally carried on by the anasto- mosing branches of the gluteal, sciatic, internal pudic, and ob- turator arteries, with the circumflex and profunda branches of the femoral artery, and with the articular branches of the pop- liteal. t Vide An Account of the Anastomosis of the Arteries at the Groin.

THE SURGICAL ANATOMY OF THE HIP-JOINT. This articulation is the most perfect specimen of the class of enarthroses, or ball-and-socket joints, which is found in the human body. The globular head of the thigh-bone is maintained in the cavity of the acetabulum by means of a strong fibrous capsule and an inter-articular ligament, to which may be added the cotyloid and transverse ligaments ; all of which are more or less covered by the synovial membrane which lines the interior of the joint. The capsular ligament is extremely strong and thick, except- ing at its internal part, where it is rather thinner and looser in its texture than at any other point. It is attached superiorly, around the greater part of the outer margin of the acetabulum, to the periosteum and rough surface of the bone ; but over the cotyloid notch its fibres are implanted upon the transverse liga- ment. Inferiorly it is fixed in front into the anterior inter-tro- chanteric line, and posteriorly into the neck of the femur, at the distance of two or three lines from the oblique ridge which ex- tends on the back part of the bone between the trochanters. The capsular ligament of the hip-joint is greatly strengthened in front by a thick band of dense fibres, which pass in a radi- ated manner from the anterior inferior spinous process of the ilium to the anterior inter-trochanteric line into which they are inserted. These fibres are sometimes called the ilio-femoral li- gament.*!* The ligamentum teres is not perfectly round in the whole of its extent; as, at the extremity where it is attached by two diver- gent processes to the opposite margins of the cotyloid notch, it is rather flattened and of a triangular figure ; towards its centre, f Ligamentum accessorium unticum.

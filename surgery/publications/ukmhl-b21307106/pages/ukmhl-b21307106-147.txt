DISLOCATION INTO THE FORAMEN OVALE. 199 No. 9. teal muscles are placed upon the stretch, which gives a flattened appearance to the buttock. In thin persons, the head of the bone may be felt on pressing deeply between the pectineus and ad- ductor longus mus- cles, forming a firm globular tumour up- on the upper and inner part of the thigh. When he stands, the patient stoops forwards, and supports himself in the erect posture upon the toes, while the heel is consider- ably elevated from the ground. In some instances of this dis- location the foot has been observed to be turned a little out- wards ; but, in the majority of cases, it is directed straight forwards. The ligamentum teres and the cap- sular ligament are torn through ; and the head of the bone, having escaped from the cavity of the ace- tabulum, is lodged upon the fibres of the obturator externus muscle, which separate it from the thyroid ligament. The pectineus and adductor brevis have been found lacerated after this dislocation, as also the fibres of the quadratus femoris, and the tendons of the external rotator museles, which arc inserted into the trochanteric fossa.

7 work satisfactory who simply removed the tumour with- out amputating the whole of the breast as well as clearing out the axilla, just as in cancer of the cervix uteri he will perform supra-vaginal amputation or complete hysterectomy no matter how early the disease be discovered. The benefit of this thoroughness is shown in the lengthened respite or in some cases in the complete cure. That the thorough operation in these two classes of cases which have served me for examples is safe is shown by the 1894 statistics, for, of the 36 amputations of the breast and of the 9 hysterectomies for cancer, all recovered. I might have mentioned two other examples of the thorough removal of malignant disease in laryngectomy for malignant disease of the larynx and proctectomy for cancer of the rectum, both of them being comparatively new and successful operative procedures. In the days when any simple operation wound might be followed by serious complications the advice necessarily given, where the question was one of mere disability or of deformity, was, " Be content with the ills you have rather than those you know not of"; but now that wound com- plications with due precautions can be discounted our sphere of usefulness is widely extended, and our advice as to operation is well exemplified in the report for 1894, where it will be found that besides the 53 radical cures of non-strangulated hernia for the removal of disability no less than 64 osteotomies were performed for the rectifi- cation of crooked legs or thighs, to say nothing of the numerous plastic operations performed simply for their aesthetic effect. I remember the time when healing by granulation was considered quite satisfactory, and occa- sionally the surgeon would be gratified by obtaining primary union ; now not to obtain healing by first inten- tion in clean operation wounds is considered discreditable

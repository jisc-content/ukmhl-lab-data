â€¢ 4 only 7 having been submitted to the radical operation. Out of these 7, 5 died, yielding a mortality of 71-3 per cent. On the other hand, in the years 1893 and 1894 ovariotomy was performed 132 times with 123 recoveries, giving a mortality of 6-8 per cent., and seeing that this includes malignant cases as well as patients extremely ill in other ways, the mortality is one of which no hospital need feel ashamed. For it must be borne in mind that statistics are in no way considered, and if an operation offers any chance of giving relief it is resorted to. Only a few years ago it was the custom to treat these cases in single wards and to have two special nurses for each, but as the work increased this was found to be impracticable, it being impossible either to provide sufficient small wards or nurses, and it soon became manifest that the patients treated in the general wards recovered equally well. H ence isolation was given up, and it is now the custom to operate on these cases in the theatre and to remove them to the general wards, just as is done with other surgical cases. Compound fractures afford a bright example of progress in treatment, for instead of amputating where the large joints are opened or where the bones are extensively smashed and the soft parts lacerated, and instead of the majority of cases having to go through a tedious process of healing by granulation, possibly with the complication of abscess and secondary haemorrhage, and after many weeks or months recovering with stiffened joints and impaired functions, at the present time, although joints may be opened and the bones severely smashed, so long as the cir- culation can be carried on amputation scarcely enters into the question, and the limb is put up, after purification of the wound, with every prospect that the case will pursue the ordinary course of recovery like a simple fracture.

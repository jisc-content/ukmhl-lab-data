10 never had such responsibility resting on his shoulders as at the present time, for it will no longer serve him to blame the supernatural for his own oversights or auto-infection for germs introduced by himself or his assistants. Know- ing what we do of the causes of wound complications, and how without that knowledge it was practically impossible to avoid them, it should excite in the mind of the surgeon of to-day the most lively admiration of the able men who brought our art to the state in which it was in the period preceding the antiseptic era. Although they were dis- quieted by failures which they believed to be beyond control they had the courage to rise above their disasters and in many cases to score successes which the modern surgeon might consider impossible under such adverse circumstances. In accepting the responsibility of operative work the surgeon has to place himself to a certain extent in the hands of those assisting him, and as the strength of a chain is tested by its weakest link, so his success may be marred by the ignorance or the carelessness of another. In hospital work and in surgical clinics this difficulty does not arise, as the surgeon can carefully select his own assistants. In a school so large as the medical department of the Yorkshire College, and with the large amount of clinical material at our disposal for the purposes of teaching, the student has every possible advantage to make himself proficient, and while dresserships are available for all, to those who are diligent and who choose to avail themselves of their opportunities the resident appointments at the in- firmary are open, so that the want of skilled assistants is never felt in hospital practice, though in private work at the homes of the patients the difficulty is at times not a little embarrassing.

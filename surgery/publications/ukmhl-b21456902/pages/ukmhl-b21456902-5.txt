3 and other operations on the gall-bladder ; enterectomy, prostatectomy, gastrotomy, pyloroplasty, hysterectomy, nephrectomy, laminectomy, laryngectomy, bone-grafting, nerve-grafting, and others, all of which are now well- established, useful and successful operative measures. In the same way a reference to the registers shows that some surgical diseases, unfortunately too common in 1870, are now happily rare, and in some instances have no place in the record of 1894. I refer to hospital gangrene, phagedasna, pyaemia, erysipelas, septicaemia, secondary haemorrhage, and such-like surgical misfortunes. No better example can be given than that of tetanus, for twenty-five years ago it was not very unusual to see this fatal disease follow even slight operations, yet during the last fifteen years I have not seen a single post-operative case, all instances that have come under observation having occurred after neglected wounds received outside the hospital. Perhaps in no class of cases has greater progress to be recorded than in abdominal diseases, which formerly were for the most part treated expectantly in the medical wards. For instance, in 1870 and 1871, under the heading " Abdominal Section " no case is recorded ; in other words, the peritoneal cavity was only opened for ovariotomy and for strangulated hernia; whereas in the two years 1893 and 1894, 573 patients had abdominal section performed in this hospital, the all-round mortality—including malignant cases, strangulation of gut, cases of acute intestinal obstruction, internal gangrene, suppurative peritonitis, &c. —showing a mortality of I2'2, or a saving of life in 87"8 per cent. The statistics of ovariotomy in this hospital twenty-five years ago were so bad that tapping was frequently resorted to in order to defer the major opera- tion, and even in 1875, 12 patients were thus treated,

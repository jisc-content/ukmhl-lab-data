Leeds, the institution in which we regularly meet, as compared with that of twenty-five years ago, might prove of sufficient interest, as it would tend to show what a reformation—or shall I term it a revolution ?—in surgical thought as well as in the science and art of surgery has taken place in the past quarter of a centur}'. To those of my hearers who, like myself, have passed through this most critical period of the history of surgery, it is most evident that the changes in these twenty-five years are simply marvellous, and if we compare the report of the Leeds Infirmary for 1870 with that for the year 1894, issued in 1895, we can see not only that the mortality all round has lessened, but that in certain operations, had not a change come, their performance would have had to remain a matter of history, since the mortality was so high as to render them almost unjustifiable. The number of operations has increased remarkably. Whereas there were in 1870, 271 general and 198 ophthalmic operations, making a total of 469, in 1894 there were 1527 general, 1200 minor, [171 ophthalmic, and 141 gynaecological operations, making a total of 5039 ; and whereas the all- round mortality in 1870 was 6-6 in 1894, although the magnitude of the operations performed was in many cases infinitely greater, it had fallen to the notably low per- centage of I'2, so that if the number of operations had been equal in the two years, and the mortality had re- mained the same, there would have been 332 deaths in 1894 instead of 60. An analysis of the hospital registers for the years named affords some interesting and startling facts ; for instance, in the 1894 report the following opera- tions are recorded which have no place in the report of 1870: radical cure of hernia, of which no less than 53 cases are given ; osteotomy, 69 cases; removal of vermi- form appendix for recurrent appendicitis ; cholecystotomy

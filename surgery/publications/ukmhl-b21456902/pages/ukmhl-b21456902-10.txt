Then, not only daily, but several times a day, the dressings had to be changed, whereas at the present time one dressing is applied at the operation, and as a rule is not changed for a week or longer or until the wound is quite healed. I find that so late as 1880 over five tons of linseed were supplied to the infirmary to be used as poultices for wounds, whereas in 1894 the amount was so small that it is not entered in the list of stores, and at the present time I think the student would have to make his acquaintance with this commodity outside the surgical wards. On the other hand, the amount of cotton wool supplied last year was over five tons, it being chiefly used in the manufacture of the antiseptic dressings salufer or salicylic wool. Although an improvement in results was steadily being brought about by increased cleanliness and by improved sanitary arrangements, it was not until the introduction of the antiseptic system by the father of modern surgery, Sir Joseph Lister, that surgery emerged from the darkness and uncertainty which had surrounded it for ages to the scientific accuracy and greater certainty of the present time. The truth of this is proved, if proofs were needed, in the facts I have mentioned, culled from our own hospital records, which are open to all. The change was not simply a gradual evolution, but a well- marked revolution, not depending so much on merely manipulative dexterity (for our hospital twenty-five years ago could boast of the greatest surgical skill) as on an in- creased knowledge of the causes of surgical disaster and how to avoid them. While on this subject it would be base ingratitude to pass on without an expression of profound sorrow for the loss sustained by science and by mankind in the person of M. Pasteur, that genius who, from the dis- covery of the causes of aberration in the processes of

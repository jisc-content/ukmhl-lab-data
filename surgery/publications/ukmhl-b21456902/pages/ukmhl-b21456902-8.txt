6 strangulated hernia illustrates not only the greater success 12-5 per cent, mortality in 1894—against 33-3 in 1870 and 6o-6 in 1874—but the difference in aim of the modern surgeon, for in 1870 the saving of life was, as a rule, simply considered, and the patient on recovery was left more crippled than ever, since the hernial aperture was as a rule larger, whereas at present the radical cure is considered an essential part of the operation. In consequence of the almost absolute safety of operative interference at an early stage of strangulation, and the almost certain cure of the hernia, very little time is wasted on taxis, and operation is urged as being a blessing, though in disguise. Even in those very terrible cases where, through ignorance or neglect, the intestine becomes gangrenous, unless the patient is too ill to bear more than a mere incision, instead of establishing an artificial anus, a cure is aimed at by excision of the gangrenous loop and restoration of con- tinuity by means of simple suture or by means of some apparatus such as the decalcified bone bobbin or the metal button, the closing of the neck of the sac so as to form a radical cure completing the opei'ation. In the treatment of certain impacted fractures such as Colles's fracture of the wrist at any age, or impacted frac- ture of the cervix femoris in a healthy young or middle- aged man, union is certain if the case be left to nature, but I take it that any surgeon would feel dissatisfied with his work if he simply rested content with securing union with- out restitution. In the same way, in transverse fracture of the patella, bony union and complete restitution, which were once rare events, are now definitely aimed at either by extra- or intra-articular suture. The tendency of modern surgery is to be thorough, this being well exempli- fied in the treatment of malignant disease ; for instance, in cancer of the breast no surgeon would now consider his

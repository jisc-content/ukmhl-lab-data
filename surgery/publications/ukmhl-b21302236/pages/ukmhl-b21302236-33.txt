13 bag filled with fluid, the jerk of which, as the animal falls, causes rupture of the containing vessel at its weakest part; and this is, in truth, the vena azygos, whose walls are thin, and only protected externally hy the pleura. At my brother’s suggestion. Professor Maffei instituted a series of observations to determine the frequency of the lesion under consideration ; and with his customary courtesy and exactness thus communi- cated the result: “ From the first of June 1854, to this date (28th May, 1855) 3095 oxen and cows were killed in our public slaughter-houses ; I have met A^ith the rupture of the azygos in fifty-seven of these animals; these ruptures occur in various parts of the said vein ; at times where the intercos- tals join it, and at others where the vein curves round to empty itself into the anterior vena cava. Such lacerations seem to occur about the same number of times in either of these situations : they bear the character of regular tears, inducing an effusion of blood between the laminae of the medi- astinum, or beneath the parietal pleura. Some- times the vital fluid flows into the thorax itself.” Taking these facts into consideration in con- nexion Avith those recorded in the appended tabu- lar exposition of cases, the mechanism of these lesions seems to admit of twofold explanation. Istly. In the case of a person falling from a height on to his head or feet, it is presumable that the heart, losing for the moment its tonicity, may be preter-

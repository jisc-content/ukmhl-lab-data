120 is enjoined that the fibrous ring at the base of the prostate should he preserved intact. The introduction of the forceps and removal of the stone complete the operation. It is impossible to convey anything more than a comparatively faint notion of an operation by verbal description. The one I have given will enable any one to follow its steps; and, I suspect, whoever tries the experiment will be surprised, as I have been, with the great simplicity and efficiency of the plan. Its advantages seem to me to be, the guide afforded by the prominence of the staff’s curve, and even of the prostate in the perinseum, the diminished risk of dividing the artery of the bulb, of wounding the rectum, or of missing the entrance into the bladder. There can he no doubt, however, that the ordi- nary lateral operation for stone as practised in this country, is also very safe and efficient in competent hands; whether the modification above described deserves preference experience must decide. Hefiecting on the Neapolitan results of lithotomy, I have been led to consider the merits of this operation in relation to lithotrity, particularly as the comparison has of late been renewed by some of our most distinguished practical surgeons."^ Lithotomy and Lithotrity,” by William Coulson, Lon- don, 1853. ‘‘ On the Relative Merit of the Two Operations for Stone,” two lectures delivered at the Royal College of Surgeons, May 1854, by Frederick C.

64 existence of several carcinomatous growths in various regions of the body.” In the following number of the Lancet (14th February), Mr. Erich- sen concurred with Mr. Birkett that this case must he regarded as one of the very rare examples of scirrhus appearing in the cicatrix after the removal of the breast for cysto-sarcoma. Mr. Erichsen adds, “ a second case of the kind has, however, very recently occurred to me in private practice, which is not only interesting as affording another instance of this peculiar sequence of pathological conditions, hut also as bearing upon a point adverted to by Mr. Paget in his recent lectures on tumours: that this appearance of a malignant growth upon the removal of a non-malignant tumour is especially apt to occur in those in whom there is an hereditary tendency to cancer. Last March, I removed a tumour the size of an orange from the breast of an unmarried lady about forty years of age, which had existed for four years, during which period it had at one time almost entirely disappeared under treatment, returning again about two years after its removal. This tumour was perfectly moveable, loosely attached by a broad pedicle to the mam- mary gland and had in no way implicated any of the neighbouring structures. After removal it presented the appearance of a chronic mammary tumour, with small cysts scattered through its sub- stance ; in fact, one form of cystic sarcoma, in illustration of which I used it in my lectures.

48 The condition in which I found the right pos- terior tibial artery merits attention. On slitting it open, it was found to contain a whitish firm cord, which, on transverse section, proved to be hollow ; and, when slit up Tongitudinally, its interior was found lined by the inner coat of the artery, and atheroma was deposited in its outer surface. Care- ful examination proved that the cord was formed by longitudinal splitting up of the middle coat of the artery, and contraction of the inner part of the said coat, including the lining membrane, into a cylinder; and that it was not a solid body con^ tained in the artery, as at first appeared, but in a shell formed by the outer coat, and most external layers of the middle one, which had preserved the original size and shape of the artery."^ the bloodvessels of the lower extremity, producing pale, dry gan- grene in the foot, by T.

These facts were noted several months before I became acquainted with the existence of M. Chassaignac’s Researches on Spontaneous Gangrene, published in the second volume of the Memoirs of the Parisian Society of Surgery, pp. 254-273. He therein describes, in all essential particulars, appearances similar to those noted above; but he appears to refer them to dissec- tion, whereas there can be no doubt that the splitting up of the

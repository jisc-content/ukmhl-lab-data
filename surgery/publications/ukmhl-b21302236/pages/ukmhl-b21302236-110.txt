In determining it, the microscope is of great service: hence its title to be regarded as a first-class auxiliary. It is very probable that errors will be committed with it, even after much more accurate study; but this will in no way affect the truth of the proposition, that the liability to err is greatly diminished by the light with which it guides the clinical student. Truly, as the micro- scope, in the majority of cases, only comes into play after the intervention of the knife, it is not a material aid to surgical treatment; it is so, never- theless, in the relief of moral suffering; for I can conceive no greater felicity to all concerned, than the being able to prognosticate with almost perfect certainty the benignancy of an excised growth, about the malignant nature of which doubts would very often be entertained but for the microscope’s aid. But let any one still disposed to question the microscope’s worth to the practical surgeon, cast a glance back half a century, to John Abernethy’s attempt to classify tumours; let him endeavour to discover the causes of the great progress which has been made in this important department of patho- logy : if impartial, he will find it impossible to refuse a lion’s share in the good work to microscopic inquiries. To many,. these reflections must seem super-

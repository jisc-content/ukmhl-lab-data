193 only then, that the testicle descended. The ra- pidity with which the disease advanced (eighth to the eighteenth month), renders it extremely un- likely that several pieces of new hone of perfect structure were developed in that short period; such a supposition would he contrary to all we know of abnormal bone formations,—especially at such an early period of existence. Several cases are recorded, in which pieces of bone with hairs and teeth discovered in the testicle, were obviously due to the arrested development of a second ovum, in- cluded within a foetus at an early period of intra- uterine existence; and to this category I am dis- posed to refer the just quoted case. Case XXXIII. In 1851, I examined in the Patho- logical Museum of the University of Pisa, the cal- cified cyst of a hydrocele of the human spermatic cord. The walls of the cyst, about one-eighth of an inch in thickness, were dona fide calcareous. The cyst itself was about the shape and size of a hen’s egg. Case XXXIV. Mr. Howship has described^ as ex- isting in his collection of specimens in pathological anatomy, “a small compact bony tumour, imbedded within the substance of an adventitious membrane, upon the surface of the testicle. The tumour, the size of a pea, has in its increase induced interstitial Practical Remarks on the Discrimination and Appearances of Surgical Disease, with an Appendix. By John Howship.

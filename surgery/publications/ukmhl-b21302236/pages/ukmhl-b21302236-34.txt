14 naturally disposed to rupture at its weakest part, in consequence of the jerk of the contained fluid. This seems a fair explanation of the manner in which the anterior edge of the left auricle gave way in my case of Thomas Millett, who fell on to the back of his head from a cart in rapid motion. Even to Dr. John Davy’s case (No. 24 in table), this expla- nation is not inapplicable : not so, however, in one of Mr. Prescott Hewett’s cases (No. 12 in table, and plate ii). A lad fell from the top of a house. The autopsy revealed rupture of upper part of intra- ventricular septum, and bruise on the corresponding anterior surface of the heart. The ecchymosis was a good sign of the mechanical violence exerted on the organ : and it is possible that when once it had occasioned a solution of continuity, this may have been augmented by the active contraction of the cardiac tissue. 2ndly. We have to consider the ruptures which are occasioned by the application of direct violence to the chest wall (e. g. case 13 of table). A girl was suddenly killed by the passage of a cart-wheel over her body. The heart was literally smashed, as the liver so commonly is in the crush of a man between the buffers of two railway carriages. It is particularly worthy of notice, though readily explicable on account of the elasticity of the tissues composing the chest wall, that they had scarcely suffered any injury. There can be no doubt that, in a minor degree, some blows on the chest may produce rupture of the heart by a me-

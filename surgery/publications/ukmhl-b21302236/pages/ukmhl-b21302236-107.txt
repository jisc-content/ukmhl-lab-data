Though preeminently unphilosophical, if, indeed, not barbarous, be medical nosology, in many of its applications, in none, perhaps, is it so much so as in the definition of a sarcoma. This unhappy term, the heritage of ignorance, was once applied to a very great variety of affections presenting some few physical characters in common, and which though clinically very various, were not distinguishable ana- tomically, for lack of investigating instruments. As these have come to hand, order has begun to pervade the jumble of our ancestors, and several distinct dis- eases are knowm to have been erroneously grouped under one head. But the nomenclature has not progressed ])ari passu., and we now find ourselves more confused in its application, relatively to the amount of knowledge possessed, than could be the pathological writers of by-gone days. The expe- rience is cheering ; for we know that the free deve- lopment of differences by enlightened inquiry, is the safest method of arriving at truth. There can be no question that Mr. Paget has done good service by introducing the term “ glan- dular tumour”;^ to which may, no doubt, be refer- Lectures on Pathology, vol. ii, p. 248 et seq. Velpeau has, apparently independently, suggested for the same tumours the

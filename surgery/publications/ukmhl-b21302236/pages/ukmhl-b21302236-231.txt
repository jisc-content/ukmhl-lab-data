One of their surfaces is smooth and shining, the other rough and irre- gular. It appears most probable that these little pieces have resulted from the fracture of a calca- reous cyst, due to calcific impregnation of the plastic matter deposited on the ^yalls of the abscess. Case XXXVI. Complete calcification of a ranis tes- ticle.^ The specimen weighed 14^ ounces, mea- suring inches in length, and 9 in circumference. Mr. Tufnell, of the Birkbeck Laboratory, sub- jected a portion of the earthy substance to quali- tative analysis, and kindly favoured me with the following result. The principal constituents were, phosphate of lime combined with a small quantity of phosphate of magnesia; a little sul- phate, and probably carbonate of lime; also some nitrogenized organic matter.’' “ Upon careful examination, the surface pre- sented to the naked eye a multitude of small, yellowish white, crescent-shaped objects, closely packed and more distinctly visible in some parts than others. (PL iv, fig. iii.) When examined with an inch lens, these shining crescent-shaped objects appeared to be the bendings of little hard cylindrical rods, emerging from the interior of the mass and there returning.

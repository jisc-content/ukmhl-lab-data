180 Museum of the Boston Society for Medical Improve- ment,^ the following preparations are described. Case i.'|â€˜ Prep. 687. A loose body from the cavity of the tunica vaginalis; it consists of a hard ossific mass, covered by a thin layer of cartilage, and is about the size of a pea. From a dissecting room subject. The testicle and serous membrane were healthy, except that from the last there hung off a slender mass of half-organised lymph, about a quarter of an inch in length. Case ii. 688. Several fragments of ossific matter from the testicle of an old negro, the organ being about three times its usual size. Case hi. 689. Ossific deposit, about an inch in length, in the substance of the testicle; organ other- wise healthy, although there is seen to have been an universal old adhesion of the tunica vaginalis. The testicle has been cut open. It was removed from a man who had had syphilis fifteen years before, had suffered from intense headache last ten years of life, and presented thickening of frontal bone, which was nearly half an inch thick and quite solid, the diploe being effaced ; the bone was rough on the outside, corresponding to ulcerations which existed there, and still more so upon the inside, where the dura mater adhered. ^ Edited by J.

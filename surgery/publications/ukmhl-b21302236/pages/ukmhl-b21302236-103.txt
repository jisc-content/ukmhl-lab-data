Its base, especially on the outer side, was very hard ; but at the anterior and upper part, over a surface one inch square, the tumour was made up of toler- ably distinct, softish, elastic nodules, apparently cysts containing liquid. Among these elastic no- dules was a very hard one. This part of the tumour was decidedly more prominent than any other, and was, moreover, peculiar for the livid discolouration of the superjacent skin, and for being more adherent to it than was the substance of the tumour to the integuments in other parts. There was no adhesion to pectoral muscles. The nipple was slightly retracted. Just within the anterior fold of the left axilla was a very hard lymphatic gland, perfectly smooth, not at all tender, about as large as a filbert. The diagnosis would have been easy but for the cystic complication. The surgeon under whose treatment K. G. was placed, diagnosed her tumour as a cystic sarcoma, and non-cancerous, for the fol- lowing reasons :â€”1. The tumour was not adherent to the pectoral muscles. 2. There was no dimple in the skin. 3. Scarcely any pain was complained of. 4. Well developed cysts were present. My opinion having been requested, I diagnosed the tumour as scirrhous associated with cysts. The absence of adhesions to the pectoral muscles, and of dimpling of the skin, the almost painlessness of the tumour, were not serious objections : scirrhous tumours are often met with in those conditions.

121 Observation of numerous cases has convinced me that lithotrity is by no means so harmless a procedure as might d priori be imagined, or as its ultra-advo- cates pretend to prove. The local and constitu- tional irritation which often follows, sometimes (though rarely) accompanies each sitting ; the num- ber of manoeuvres required; the difficulty often experienced in the expulsion of the fragments; their liability to impaction; the frequent super- vention of cystitis; the occasional though rare sequence of urinary infiltration and purulent in- fection; the liability to reconstruction of a cal- culus on a residual fragment;—are all detracting circumstances. Velpeau and Malgaigne have so invalidated Civiale’s statistics of this operation, that they cannot be admitted as conclusive; and Notes on Lithotomy, with an Account of the Results of the Operation in the Author’s Practice,” Lancet, March 24, 1855. “ The author concludes his paper by stating that his experience had certainly led him to the conclusion that lithotrity, if pru- dently and carefully performed, with a due attention to minute circumstances, is liable to smaller objections than almost any other of the capital operations of surgery ; the cases to which it is not applicable being very few indeed, and chiefly those in which, from the calculus having attained an unusual size, the danger and difflculty of lithotomy are so great, that no surgeons would willingly, nor otherwise than as a matter of duty, under- take it.” A few weeks afterwards a very different judgment was asserted by Mr. Syme: ‘^On the whole, I am of opinion that the wholesome, effectual, and, I will add also, safe method of excision, should in general he preferred to crushing.” (Lec- ture on Lithotomy and Lithotrity, in Lancet, May 26, 1855.)

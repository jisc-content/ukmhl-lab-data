74 the sooner they are proved false the better; but the evidence adduced against them must at least be as valid as that upon which they are based. It may not be inappropriate to append from my clinical note-books the histories of other two cases, in which, from the existence of cysts on scirrhous bases, the diagnosis was difficult, but in which the microscope cleared up the doubt. Case ii. K. G., aged 59, had never been a strong woman, but always healthy. Catamenia appeared first at 15, last at 47 years. She had had nine children and six miscarriages. She had never heard of cancer or tumours of breast in any of her family. Five years ago, a little tumour, about as large as the end of the little finger, appeared just under the skin above the left nipple. She could move it easily. It was of about present hardness, not pain- ful, nor had it ever been so, with the exception of the last month, when she had occasionally, while wringing clothes, felt a little pain on its inner side for a few minutes. She spontaneously described the pain as the pricking occasioned by a needle, but it had been very trifling. For about a year the tumour did not grow, but it had since gradually enlarged. She thought it had grown most rapidly in the last twelve months; during the same period, the skin covering it had become discoloured. The tumour occupied the left breast, was about as large as a good sized apple, irregularly sphe- roidal, and inseparably connected with the gland.

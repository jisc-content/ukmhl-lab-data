43 vein downwards, the superficial femoral vein con- tains a clot which becomes irregularly smaller and less adherent as it descends. It ceases completely about its middle. Whereas, above the orifice of the saphena, the clot is quite dry, below it, it is bathed by a fluid, in colour and consistency very much like chocolate and milk. Below the part where the clot ends, the vein is filled with a fluid of this kind. Opposite the termination of the said clot the femoral is joined by a venous branch, on tracing which into the triceps extensor, its first part is found to contain more of the chocolate-like fluid, but further on it contains a fluid like good pus. On sponging this away the lining membrane remains rough, in consequence of white matter remaining adherent to it. On removing the fluid from the superficial femoral, its lining membrane presents a similar appearance. Both these veins are preternaturally red where the white pus-like matter does not adhere to their inner coat. The deep femoral vein at its upper part is oc- cluded by an adherent clot, which becomes softer and acquires more the character of a healthy venous clot as it descends. The muscles of the thigh are healthy. The external and internal saphenous veins in the right leg are perfectly healthy; their orifices on the face of the stump are closed by adhesive matter. The popliteal vein is of a purplish colour, with very close vascular network on its exterior,

53 to the patient’s comfort. The question is, should the part once dead be removed by the knife, or be left until severed from the living by nature’s effort. The latter alternative had been almost universally assented to, when it was once more, and that very recently, called in question in the great surgical societies of London and Paris. M. Chassaignac^' concludes a commentary on a case of the kind, in which he amputated while the gangrene was spread- ing, by laying down as a rule, “ that, when ampu- tation is performed for senile gangrene, the knife should only be applied where the arterial pulsations are unmistakably felt.” This precautionary rule may in some measure be a guarantee that the stump will be supplied with blood, and not subject to mor- tification ; but it will not lessen the chances, always considerable, of gangrene occurring in other parts. In a discussion which took place about the same time in our own Medico-Chirurgical Soci- ety,t cases of successful amputation in this dis- ease were mentioned; and it was sought to infer therefrom arguments in favour of a more extended application of the practice. It is curious that the case which provoked the discussion was by no means one of the ordinary cases of dry gangrene, with reference to which alone the amputation question can be debated.

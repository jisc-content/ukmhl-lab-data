87 of cancer, the surgical profession is bound to ex- amine carefully all evidence tendered in support of any new method; considering that Dr. Landolfi makes no secret whatever of his plan, I accepted his invitation to witness his practice. The result of my inquiry is the basis of this communication. The treatment consists in the destruction of the cancerous product by the application of a paste prepared by adding s. of flour or powdered liquo- rice to a compound of equal parts of the chlorides of bromium, zinc, gold and antimony. Frequently, only the flrst of these substances is employed. The proper method of applying the paste is on a piece of linen cut to the size of the part to he destroyed. At the end of twenty-four hours the rag is removed, and in the course of three or four days it becomes manifest that the part is dead, and in process of limitation by an ulcerative line; as the slough separates, the sore is occasionally dressed with charpie soaked in a solution of from ten to twenty grains of the chloride of bromium in twelve ounces of water; with this exception it is treated as a common wound, and the patient is ordered to take, morning and evening, a pill containing one-tenth of a grain of the same chloride."^ In consequence of the very intensely irritating power of the fumes emitted from the chloride of bromium, care must be ob- served in dealing with it. Thus the paste should be prepared in the open air, Avith the mouth covered; and during, and for a short time after, its application, the patient should sit near an open window.

37 absence of calcific degeneration in particular vessels. I distinctly remember, however, that there was no notable calcification in the arteries of the affected upper limbs, in accordance with the well-known fact, that, frequent as this change is in the aorta and its inferior ramifications, it is uncommon in the subclavian and brachial arteries and their divisions. The anatomical characters observed on dissection of the left upper limb, prove that inflammation, and consequent ccclusion of its arteries by plastic de- posit, was the cause of the mortification in this case. Facts similar to those above recorded have been once observed in the upper limb by M. Chas- saignac,* and thus the occasional sequential relation of arteritis and dry gangrene no longer admits of doubt.'j' It must, however, be admitted, that in Recherches sur la Gangrene Spontanee, appelee Gangrene senile, par M. Chassaignac. Mem. de la Soc. Chir. de Paris, vii, pp. 254-273. M. Chassaignac’s case was one of only par- tially dry gangrene of right hand and forearm. The subject was fifty-seven years old, and there can be no doubt that his ailment was senile gangrene, somewhat moister than usual. The evi- dences of arteritis were very well marked. f The compilers of M. Dupuytren’s Legons Or ales de Clinique Chirurgicale have shown themselves rather careless of his fame in recording his opinions relatively to La Gangrene Sympto- matique par suite d’arterite.” In two of the cases (i and iii), calcification was the distinctive anatomical change in the arte- rial coats. Case ii is one of sloughing of the scrotum and penis without known reason; and certainly no mention is made of arteritis. Even the other facts and arguments they have col- lected are far from proving that arteritis is the cause of dry gan- grene.

95 I cannot close this communication without ex- pressing disapprobation of the manner in which this subject has been dealt with by many medical journalists and practitioners of Germany. Landolli came amongst them as a professor, ready to com- municate to everybody all the details of his mode of treatment. The ordinary pharmacists in the towns he has visited have compounded his prescriptions, and numerous medical men have regularly attended his practice. Thus, even though he might be in error, which I believe he is to a considerable extent, he is exempt from the reputation of a quack so liberally heaped upon him. His most eager friends have not benefited him so' much as his opponents, whose vehemently passionate and abusive criticism has invested him with the interest attaching to all martyrs, and called down upon them the calm but heavy censure of such men as the eminent Moriz von Stuhenrauch.^ I firmly believe that, if on Landolfi’s first appearance in Germany, the ques- tion had been placed on the basis established in this communication, much wrangling would have been spared, to the great economy of patients’ suf- fering and of professional decorum. On Landolfi rests the onus prohandi; on the surgical profession the onus audiendi. Vague assertions and wholesale denials will eventually benefit neither party; pre- cise statements, patient observation, and severe reasoning, must soon solve the problem.

57 e. The white firm cord described by Carswell and others as occurring in the arteries of limbs affected with dry gangrene is sometimes made up of the lining membrane and inner layers of the middle coat, consequent upon longitudinal splitting up of the latter. It would he interesting to deter- mine how often this change occurs, and what is its causal or sequential relation to the morbid phe- nomena. /. In the treatment of dry gangrene, antiphlo- gistics are as a rule deprecable. Hegimen must be suited to special indications; sometimes strictly farinaceous, at others generous and even stimulat- ing diet may be necessary. The exclusive advocacy of the former by Mr. Syme, of the latter by Sir Benjamin Brodie, offers material for clinical inquiry into the relative merits of the two systems in par- ticular cases. The internal administration of opium is of great value. Enveloping the part in carded wool is preferable to poultices. Traditional expe- rience and statistics proscribe the amputating knife, but exceptional cases are on record in which it has been successfully employed; and it may be advis- able to resort to it rather than wait for their separation when the progress of the disease is very slow, and special signs indicate more than common vitality in the adjoining textures and in the system generally.

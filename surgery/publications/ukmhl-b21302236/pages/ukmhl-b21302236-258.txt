214 best of my knowledge, have any such cases been met with in the human subject. It is easy, how- ever, to understand that the seminal ducts of man may become calcified in consequence of cretefac- tion of the tubercular matter, of which they are occasionally the seat. (Curling, p. 282-3.) d. True ossific degeneration of the testicle.—Case XXXIX is the only well authenticated example of this condition with which I am acquainted; the bony con- version appears referable to the very advanced age of the subject; it would be curious to know the morphological steps of such extraordinary osseous formations. Cases ii, iii, viii, xiii, xxii, xxvi of this memoir also refer to ossification of the testicle, but they are regretably deficient in details where- from to infer their precise characters. Two of those cases, however, call for further remark. The subject of case iii had suffered for several years from tertiary syphilis, and died with extensive analogous disease of the frontal bone ; there was a universal old adhesion of the tunica vaginalis and an ossific deposit, about an inch in length, in the substance of the testicle. Fournier’s case, No. XXII, is certainly very remarkable ; but so unsatis- factorily recorded, as to possess no scientific in- terest beyond acting as a stimulus to further in- quiry. e. Ossification of cartilage developed within, or in immediate connexion with the testicle. It is a well-established fact, that cartilage may occur in

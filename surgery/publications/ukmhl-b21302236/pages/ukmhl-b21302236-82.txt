54 formed in the leg, discharged, and healed. Pus accumulated in the knee-joint, and was spontane- ously evacuated. The patient’s health improved, and amputation was performed, on 30th of Sept., with good result. The history of this case is obviously exceptional, not only on account of the slow progress of the disease, but of the constitutional vigour betokened by the purulent depositions, by the granulation of their residual chasms, and by the improvement of the general health in spite of the local malady. There can be no doubt that the surgeon, Mr. Gar- lake, very correctly interpreted the constitutional state, and aided nature’s effort by the removal of the dead parts. But the case has no bearing upon the question of amputation in dry gangrene, when (which is the rule) the tissues successively die with scarcely any manifestation of systemic vigour. What Cl priori therapeutic argumentation, does ascertained pathological fact warrant \ The disease results from arterial mischief, which commonly affects the system extensively. Bemoval of the dead part by the knife does not, therefore, ward off the cause, which may give rise to similar mortification in the stump or other parts, while the dangers of amputation are superseded : these, be it noted, are very considerable in old persons with diseased arte- ries. Moreover, the dead part is dry, and not incon- venient beyond the production of some fetor and pain, which admit of counteraction by sedatives and disinfectants.

This Work is intended as a guide to Artists in the delineation of the Horse; as an indispensable treatise to Amateurs in obtaining a thorough knowledge of form ; and to the Anatomical Student as a guide in the study of the Locomotive System. The Plates, executed with the greatest fidelity, regardless of expense and labour, represent different aspects of the Horse anatomized, — the anatomical foiTQs assumed by the limbs in action,—besides the structure of the Foot, and representations of Horses’ Mouths for the recognition of their age. To render the whole specially instructive to lovers of ai’t, two elegant Plates, from the Works of the Greek School, complete the Series.

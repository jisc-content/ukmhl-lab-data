206 a horse. My brother, who found the specimen in Romagna and took a drawing of it, has furnished the following description. “ The epididymis is in great measure indurated, and the body of the testicle is destroyed, but a bony case remains, co- vered with dry tunica vaginalis. On one side is an opening, and in the interior are bony and mem- branous laminae, intercepting and partially filling up the cavity. It appears that the seminiferous tubes have been mostly absorbed and some of them indurated, whilst the specimen is principally made up of the calcified fibrous structures, interstitially disposed and covering the testicle.”^ While revising the proof of this sheet, Mr. Henry Lee has kindly sent me a specimen of bony looking matter which he removed from a man’s testicle. It is in several fragments, the aggregate about the size of a bean; the little pieces are friable, and appear of calcareous nature. Mr. Lee gives me the follow- ing history of the case. “ A man, above the middle age, of florid complexion, had long suffered from enlargement of the testicle, for which he had been subjected to a great variety of treatment. When I first saw him about two years ago, a sinus led into the testis and discharged a thin fluid. Upon intro- ducing a probe into the sinus, a hard substance was immediately felt; a pair of fine forceps were then introduced through the same opening, and the accompanying calcareous matter without any difficulty extracted.” It is quite possible that the hard substance owed its origin to cretefaction of tubercle, which we know occurs in small circumscribed masses in the testicle, and has a tendency to seek an outlet through fistulous aperture. Mr. Lee’s case bears considerable resemblance to Mr. Curling’s, No. XXI. of this memoir.

Scattered through it, however, were seen a great number of vessels of considerable size, tilled with a straw-coloured substance, which made them so hard and stiff, that when the finger was passed over them, they felt like wires; they were most numerous at the inferior part of the organ, where they were coiled up into branches, resembling the spermatic organs of the worm. There was also a considerable number at the top of the testicle, and several could be seen scattered here and there in its body. Fig. II. The left testicle was greatly wasted ; it was not more than a fourth of the bulk of the right, while the vas deferens and its branches ap- peared to have preserved their original size.

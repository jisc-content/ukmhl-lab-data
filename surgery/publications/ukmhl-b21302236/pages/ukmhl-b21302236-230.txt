194 absorption of the adjacent surface of the gland^ into which it has sunk. The tunica vaginalis, partially separated by dissection, is otherwise seen closely adherent to the testicle.” Case XXXV. Dr. Giosue Marcacci gives the fol- lowing history of an individual, from whose testicle were removed a large number of calcareous frag- ments, preserved in the University of Pisa, where I examined them. “ N., aged 75, became the sub- ject of inflammation of the testicle, which suppu- rated, and through an opening of spontaneous formation discharged a large quantity of pus. The suppurative discharge was peculiarly fetid, and only ceased with the patient’s existence, about six months after the commencement of the dis- ease. “ The testicle was about three times its natural size.

I have examined the so-called bony laminae, and find them to consist of about a drachm of calca- reous material in irregularly shaped plates of vari-

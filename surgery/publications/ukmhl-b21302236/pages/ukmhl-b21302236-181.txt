We have finally arrived at the consideration of the plan of treating fractures by the so-called im- movable apparatus^ a term not literally correct, yet practically convenient for its distinctiveness.* Starch bandages and pasteboard splints have hitherto been the materials employed in the construction, but recently the plaster of Paris bandages” have been introduced by Messrs.

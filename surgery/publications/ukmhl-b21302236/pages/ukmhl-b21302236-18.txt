XIV INTRODUCTION. with permission to have drawings taken of ruptured hearts in St. George’s Hospital; Mr. Sydney Jones has furnished me with notes of the preparations relating to calcification of the testicle and append- ages, which are contained in the Museums of Guy’s and St. Thomas’s Hospitals; my researches into that subject have also been assisted by Mr. Fitz- gerald, Mr. Henry Lee, and Mr. Quekett. Dr. E-eid, of the Army Medical Department, has afforded me opportunity of examining the happy results of his exertions in adding to the eflfciency of all kinds of surgical apparatus, that employed in the treatment of fracture in particular; Mr. Benjamin Hunt has given me permission to avail myself of his valuable papers on the treatment of fractures. My brother John has supplied me with several original facts on the subjects of rupture of the heart and calcification of the testicle. Almost all the drawings which illustrate this work have been executed by him from nature, and on stone. He has materially aided me in bibliographical research, and whoever forms a generous estimate of the results of my exertions, must bear in mind that they would have been less fruitful, but for him.

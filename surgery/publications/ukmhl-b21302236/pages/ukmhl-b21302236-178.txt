150 appears a good one d priori; experience has de monstrated it to be productive of some good results, and, in my opinion, as superior to the majority of contrivances by which fractures are commonly treated; further experimentation, to be conducted without prejudice, with attention to principles, with simplicity and exactness in appliances, will eventually pronounce a more full and true judg- ment. Thus far we have followed out the working of Mr. Pott’s doctrine. A totally opposite one, that of permanent extension, as advocated by his contemporary Desault, now invites attention. It would be mere matter of historical interest to dwell uj)on the arguments adduced for and against this plan, on the one hand, by that great surgeon of the Hotel-Dieu, and by his zealous disciple and bio- grapher, Bichat; on the other, by the adherents and converts to Mr. Pott’s system, illustrious amongst whom must be recorded Dupuytren and Delpech. As it is in the treatment of fractures of the thigh that the permanent extension plan has more gene- ral and advantageous application, and since the long splint of Mr. Liston is deemed the most simple and eificient contrivance for keeping it up, I shall consider the principle of action of this instrument, and its practical eifects.^' My present experience of permanent extension apparatus for the thigh is confined to Desault’s, Boyer’s, and Liston’s splints.

165 board splints, prepared as before described, were adjusted; two for the leg, reaching from the sole of the foot to above the knee; and four for the thigh, the posterior and external reaching from below the knee to the crista ilii, the anterior from above the patella to the fold of the groin, and the inner from below the knee to the perinseum ; thus, it will be observed, the inner and outer thigh splints overlapped at the knee-joint the lateral leg splints; these were retained by careful bandaging and starch, great attention being paid to cover the hip-joint as much as possible. The counter-exten- sion band was cut off where it appeared from beneath the apparatus, both before and behind, and the band for extension at the foot was served in the same manner. The limb being now exa- mined, was found to be of the right length; and it was also seen that the apparatus completely con- trolled muscular action so as to prevent displace- ment or shortening from recurring ; the only thing which remained to be done was to apply two or three thigh splints, made of wood, until the case was dry, to prevent the limb from bending; care also being taken to prevent eversion, by watching the position of the knee and foot, and obviating any tendency, by cushions or pillows. â€œ My notes state that for three or four hours after the apparatus had been applied, much pain was felt; and that he could not sleep at night be- cause of the starting of the limb.

104 culation test in syphilis, as second to none of the means available throughout the whole range of medicine in forming a correct diagnosis; yet, as even this test may fail, the whole history of the disease must he taken into consideration, and very great caution observed before a judgment is formed in direct opposition to what general experience indicates as its probable nature. Whoever reflects how much the progress of knowledge is arrested by the lack of sufficient severity in the observation of individual facts, will see the necessity of exhausting every resource for the exclusion of fallacy, in the experimental study of a matter so fraught with dif- culty as is the whole subject of venereal disease. While Professor’s Sperino’s candour, kindness, scientific enthusiasm, and marvellous powers of application, excited my highest admiration and gratitude, I should have been additionally pleased previously, I suspected my little sore might be specific; and as it occasioned great suffering, I begged my friend Joseph Lister to destroy it with nitric acid, after having inoculated the corresponding arm. This he did in two places; but the spots did not even redden. I rested tranquilly, in hopes of being exempt; but another month brought out papular syphilide of scalp and body, ulcerated throat, and threatening, big bubo in axilla. A more full account of my case will be found in the Association Medical Journal^ December 16, 1853, p. 1108. Can it be that in both the cases just quoted, the inoculations failed because the systems were so impregnated with syphilitic virus as to be insusceptible of producing chancres by the introduction of fresh poison,—that, in fact, syphilisation had occurred ?

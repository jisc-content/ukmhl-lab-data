198 distinct. The testicle being divided lengthways, is seen to be solid throughout, except in the centre, which is marked by a groove resembling in form the letter J, and measuring in length about one inch and a quarter, and one-sixth of an inch in breadth. The boundaries of this groove are compact, smooth, and glistening; it does not reach either extremity of the testicle. On the whole, the calcified mate- rial is less compact, and the specific gravity lighter, than in the testicle, case xxxvi of the present memoir. In the interior of Dr. Crisp’s specimen, many of the hard and solid tubes are seen cut across, while the bendings of others remain per- fect : the interior of the calcified tubes is whiter than the circumference, which, however, is not so dark and glistening as in the tubes of the last specimen described. A considerable amount of granular calcareous material is interspersed among the tubes. On the whole, the appearance of Dr. Crisp’s specimen is not so much that of bond fide calcified testicle, as is that of case xxxvi, which may be considered the explanatory key. Case xxxviii. In Dr. Carswell’s collection of pathological drawings, in University College, is a drawing (from which fig. i, ii, pi, iv, are taken), representing the process of calcification in the tes- ticles of a goat, at a much earlier stage than the two cases just described. The following description is appended to Dr. Carswell’s drawing. Fig. I represents the right testicle laid open

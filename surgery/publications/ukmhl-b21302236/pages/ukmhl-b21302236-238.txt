202 centre of a fibro-adipose tumour attached to the testicle of a horse. I here reprint, with insignifi- cant verbal modifications, the account which I published of this specimen in 1850. The tumour occupied the posterior part of the testicle, and was invested by the tunica albuginea; its size about that of a small orange. On section, the bulk of it appeared made up of a mixture of fibrous tissue and fat,â€”appearance confirmed by the mi- croscope. Two narrow crescent-shaped pieces of cartilage-looking tissue were seen in the middle of the cut surface, firmly adhering to the surrounding adipo-fibrous tissue ; on grasping, with two fingers, the right half of the tumour, a hard mass was felt in its interior, and more particularly towards the outer surface, near the tunica albuginea, from which it was only separated by a small quantity of fibrous tissue: this being dissected off, a dirty white surface was exposed, which was of bony hardness in a considerable part of its extent, but at one part yielded to the knife. In this situation, a small piece of the apparently imperfect bone being removed, a cavity, capable of containing a large filbert, was exposed; its boundary was consti- tuted by a thin layer of bone, resting on cartilage, and lined by a closely adherent white fibrous mem- brane. A thin perpendicular section of the carti- laginous-looking structure, with some of the adherent fibrous tissue, exhibited, under the mi- croscope, true cartilage cells, disseminated in a

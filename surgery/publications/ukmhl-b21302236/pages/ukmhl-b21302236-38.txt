16 tion was not fully imitated by the French observer: so as to leave no room for the slightest doubt as to whether the bruise was really the only lesion of the heart. A good example of the cardiac lesions under con- sideration has been placed upon record by Dr. Gia- como Matfei.* A robust young man, struck by the trunk of a great tree, which he was engaged in rolling down a steep descent, remained senseless for a few minutes, and died. Only slight excoriations were perceptible externally. The bones and invest- ing soft parts were healthy. The mediastinum and right pleura were filled with blood; the pericar- dium ruptured, as was also the right auricle in two places. The heart was perfectly healthy in consistence, texture, and size. In a valuable essay on wounds of the heart, by Dr. Purple,*!* which Mr. Chatto kindly directed my attention, the following passage occurs: “ A curious circumstance attendant upon gun-shot wounds of the heart is that in which the ball causing the w*ound has penetrated the walls of the chest, and produces a perforation in one or both ventricles, but there is no corresponding wound in I quote from Schmidt’s Jahrhiicher der Medizin, vol. 74, p. 80, where the original is quoted as Gazzetta Medica Italiana Federativa Lomharda, 1851, No. 7. f Statistical Observations on Wounds of the Heart, and on their Relations to Forensic Medicine ; with a Table of forty-two recorded Cases.

By this incision I exactly divide the bulb of the urethra, and by doing this on its side, we are sure to avoid wounding the intestine or rectum, which for want of this precaution has been often cut. This first incision being made, I again pass the point of the knife into the curvature of the staff to the part where it bears against the peri- naeum, and direct it to be held there by the assist- ant who supports the scrotum; this done, I take a large director, the end of which is made with a knob like that of a gorget, and conveying this back upon the blade of the knife into the groove of the staff, I draw the knife out. I then slide the back of this director along the groove of the staff into the bladder, and I withdraw the staff by turning the handle towards the patientâ€™s belly.

80 red the chronic mammary tumour of Sir Astley Cooper,^ “the partial hypertrophy of the mammary gland” of Lebert,*!* “ the imperfect hypertrophy of the mammary gland” of Birkett.J Thus a clearly significant name has been given to solid tumours of the breasts, structurally consisting of hypertrophy of the normal constituent of the gland, and clini- cally benignant. But the cystic complication is a source of serious confusion. We are not yet in a position to determine, according to anatomical cha- racters and pathological tendencies, the precise nature of the “ tumor mammae hydatidis” of Sir Astley Cooper,§ of Brodie’s sero-cystic tumour of the female breast,|| of Muller’s three varieties of cysto-sarcoma—simplex, pfoliferum, and phyllo- des.^ The introduction of the term “ cystic carci- noma” by Bokitansky,^'^ has been of service in distinguishing those cases of scirrhus which are associated with cysts. To avoid the confusion ‘‘non-adipoid”: thus happily the two greatest authorities on the subject in England and France, are agreed. [Traite des Maladies du Sein, 1854, p. 350.)

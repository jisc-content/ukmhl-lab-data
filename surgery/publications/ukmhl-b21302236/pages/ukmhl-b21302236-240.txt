204 With a view to ascertain if the bone owed its origin to the ordinary process of intra-cartilaginous ossification, a perpendicular section of the cartilage was made, including, at one extremity, a very small portion of the partially ossified structure. Under the microscope the walls of the cartilage corpuscles (fig. v) were observed to become very indistinct in proportion as the boundary of ossification was approached; they appeared, in fact, to have become confounded with the matrix, which had undergone a change from its original character; it was more opaque and coarsely granular than in specimens of the unaltered cartilage (fig. iv), and the tissue ap- peared mapped out into oval or irregularly-shaped figures, the boundaries of which were dark, while the interior was bright, and contained one or more nuclei, that were, for the most part, arranged in groups; were smaller, and more closely approached the circular form, than those at a greater distance from the seat of ossification. At the confines of the cartilage and bone the opaque earthy deposit was evidently encroaching upon the matrix of the cartilage, and surrounding the corpuscles ; some of these were completely enclosed by an opaque mate- rial, arranged in concentric lines, within which the nucleus of the cartilage corpuscle was still visible. Some corpuscles, however, were not completely en- closed, but the earthy deposit was perceived ad- vancing on each side of the cell, leaving it free at one part. In bringing a deeper and older portion

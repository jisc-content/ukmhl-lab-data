56 tion and consequent obstruction to the blood’s flow is the most common cause ; equally certain that the obstruction is sometimes, though rarely, indepen- dent of atheromatous and calcific degeneration of the arterial coats, and due to their inflammation, and to the consequent deposition of plastic material in the vessel’s bore. Both pathological states—cal- cification and inflammation—occasionally operate simultaneously in the same or different parts of one individual. h, A part affected with the ordinary dry gan- grene of the aged, though commonly black, some- times preserves its natural colour, and it may do so—contrary to the opinion of Chevallier—even though the veins of the limb may be obliterated in addition to the arteries. c. The extent of a part affected with dry gan- grene does not bear relation to the extent of ob- literation in the large arteries; sometimes an inverse ratio is observable. The degree in which obstruc- tion of the capillaries and small arteries contributes to the disease, is a point requiring investigation, which promises to be fertile in results interesting to the scientific pathologist. d. The supervention of phlebitis, an occasional though not very common occurrence, does not prevent, nor apparently even materially retard, the separation of a dry gangrenous part by the natural process—disjunctive absorption.

17 the pericardium. A case of this character is re-> ported by Professor Holmes,^ of Montreal. The patient, a young man, lived but a short time after the receipt of the injury. On dissection, the an- terior wall of the right ventricle contained a trans- verse linear opening, sufficiently large to admit the finger. Corresponding to this opening in the heart was observed a bloody ecchymosed condition of the cellular substance lying on the pericardium, which led to the inference that the pericardium had been driven before the ball and into the heart, while this organ was in the act of contraction, its fibres being hard and rigid from their muscular contraction. The ball was found loose in the cavity of the pleura.” But for a reference in Dr. Purple’s memoir, I should have continued ignorant of another able essay on wounds of the heart, by Mr. Cathcart Lees,*j' who divides them into punctured and contused ; to the latter he only makes incidental allusion, the value of which is however rendered very consider- able by the annexed remarks, that in the last siege of Antwerp by the French, some remarkable cases occurred in which the heart was severely con- tused and ruptured without any external appear- ance of injury either to the integuments or ribs, in which the death, in some cases instantaneous, was British Amer.

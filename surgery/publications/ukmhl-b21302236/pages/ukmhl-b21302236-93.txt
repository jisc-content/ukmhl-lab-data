These rapidly increased in size, and were speedily followed by considerable enlargement of the axillary glands, which had not previously existed. There was now no doubt in my own mind, nor in that of three or four other surgeons who saw this patient in con- sultation with me, that the secondary disease was w^ell-marked scirrhus. Death occurred five months after the re-appearance of the disease, from ery- sipelas and general exhaustion. I have since learned that three of this lady’s aunts had been the subjects of cancer.” Again, in his work on The Science and Art of Surgery (p. 717), Mr. Erichsen alludes to these two cases as evidence that a recur- rence of cancer will occasionally take place in the cicatrix, after the removal of cystic sarcomatous growths. Mr. Paget has thus commented upon this sub- ject in his lectures on Surgical Pathology (vol. ii, p. 259). “ It has sometimes happened that a glandular tumour has been removed from a breast, and within a short time the same breast has be- come the seat of cancer. (See such a case by Mr. Erichsen in theZ^s5?z^?^^,14th January, 1852; and the history of a series of preparations in the catalogue of the museum of St. Bartholomew’s, vol. i, p. 446).” From these facts, then, it appears that a disease F

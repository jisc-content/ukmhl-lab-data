189 Case XXIX. Entitled ossification of the testicles in a year old colt^ the following account is inserted in the Veterinarian for December 1855, by Mr. Andrew Cunningham, of Inverkeillor, N.B. â€œ On the 17th April 1855, I was requested to go a con- siderable distance to see a valuable year old colt, of the farm breed, belonging to a gentleman, which was intended to be kept entire; but owing to an enlargement of one of the testicles having been ob- served to gradually take place, my opinion was asked concerning it. On examination of the part, I found both testicles increased in size to such an extent, that on standing behind the animal, the scrotum had the appearance of being as large as in a horse of four years old. Manipulation showed one of the testicles to be as hard as bone, and to have every indication of being adherent to the sur- rounding parts. The other felt quite loose, and not nearly so hard. I told the owner he wmuld never do for an entire horse, and, as far as I w^as able to judge, both testicles w^ere in a state of dis- ease. On hearing this, he said that he would leave me to do as I thought proper; and at once I had the colt thrown for castration. On making an incision through the scrotum, I had to dissect com- pletely around the testicle, to free it from its ad- of fact were exceptions to the scientific, and particularly to the pathological, jargon of his day. The facts recently ascertained render it extremely probable that the cases so severely handled by V'allisnieri were genuine, though overadorned in description.

119 little below the surface, the right index finger de- tects the anterior edge of the prostate ; the point of the knife^ pierces the membranous urethra a little in front of that edge, and now the operatorâ€™s two hands must co-operate; with the left one, the handle of the staff is carried upwards, towards the middle line, and backwards ; thus the con- cavity of the staff becomes distant from the rec- tum as it approaches the pubis, and the point is pushed further on into the bladder. Simultaneously, the point of the knife having been from the first kept in contact with the staff, the right hand is raised and pushed forward, so that the back of the knife slides along the groove, and its point enters the bladder; the blade being narrow, it only notches the anterior edge of the prostate and its urethral surface in the passage onwards. It is not until the point has entered the bladder that the prostatic incision is completed ; and this is done by fixing the back of the knife against the staff, and directing its point downwards and to the left, in the direction of the inferior oblique axis of the prostate, the one commonly divided; the knife is now withdrawn without cutting, in the same direc- tion in which it was introduced. The maxim is, to make the prostatic incision as small as is con- sistent with the safe extraction of the calculus. It ^ At this stage of the operation the Neapolitan surgeons com- monly exchange the ordinary scalpel for one cutting only for an inch at its extremity.

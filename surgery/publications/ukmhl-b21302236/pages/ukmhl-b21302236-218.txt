182 Case xiY, Preparation 56, Series xxviii, in Ana- tomical Museum of St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, is thus described in its Catalogue."^ “ Sections of a testicle, with the cavity of the tu- nica vaginalis obliterated by layers of false mem- brane, a third of an inch in thickness, and very tough and compact. At the posterior part, by the side of the epididymis, earthy matter has been de- posited in the midst of the new tissue. The sub- stance of the testicle is soft, but not otherwise dis- eased ; it is of natural size, but the epididymis is enlarged and indurated. All the tissues around the tunica vaginalis appeared thickened, adherent, and hard; and, together with the thick layer of false membrane, gave the characters of a consider- able enlargement of the testicle itself. “ The other testicle was similarly but less dis- eased.” The Museum of the Army Medical Department at Fort Pitt, Chatham, contains a series of highly interesting preparations, illustrating calcification of the tunica vaginalis, and particularly the mode of origin of the loose cartilaginous and ossific-like bodies which are sometimes met with in its cavity. Case XV. 1910. Sac of a hydrocele, with a plate of ossific matter deposited in the tunica vaginalis, the interior of which is rough and irregular.

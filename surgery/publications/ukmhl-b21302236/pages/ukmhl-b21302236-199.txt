After the third day the man got up daily, and perfect union oc- curred in due time, without shortening or deformity. This is conservative surgery. What other mode of treatment would have given such results 1 And those cases are not exceptional. Mr. Hunt tells us he has selected them from amongst many others equally successful. They accord with the experience recorded in my little treatise on this subject; and the v/orks of Seutin Burggraeve, Croq, Velpeau, and Salvagnoli Mar- chetti, record numerous cases no less remarkable and demonstratively conclusive. With the greatest reverence for the old academy of surgery, which expressed its disapprobation of systems,—a dislike commonly well founded,—it is nevertheless true that the aim of every scientific

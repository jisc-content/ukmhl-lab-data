164 of the powerful action of the surrounding muscles, I had recourse to the following expedient; a strong piece of calico three-quarters of a yard wide and six yards long, was split at one end for half its length; the broad undivided portion was passed obliquely under the patientâ€™s back, from the right hip to the left shoulder, while of the two ends made by splitting the calico, one was brought forward over the right trochanter and ilium, the other to the inner side of the thigh against the perinseum, which was protected by a fold of lint, and both carried obliquely across the abdomen and chest to meet the one behind at the left side of the neck, where the three were fastened together, and at- tached by one common band to a convenient part of the bedstead ; thus counter extension w^as fully provided for, and a covering obtained for the right buttock, which is desirable when applying the ap- paratus for a fracture of the thigh. Extension was made from the foot by attaching it to a pole six or eight feet long, held vertically, one end of the pole being fixed in a groove in the floor, the other used as a handle to make leverage with; and as the foot was fastened to the pole so as to raise it several inches from the bed, the required extension could be made and kept up without interfering with the application of the apparatus. Care being taken to keep the limb in a proper position, it was next bandaged from the cleft of the toes to above the ilium, and then after a coating of starch, the mill-

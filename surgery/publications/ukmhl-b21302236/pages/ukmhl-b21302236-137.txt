But it may be said, if, besides curing these prostitutes, you render them incapable of contracting syphilis; if, besides discovering a more potent remedy for this disease than you now possess, you discover a preventive, you will destroy one of the barriers providentially destined to check illegitimate sexual intercourse. Whilst I have yet to be informed of the evidence in support of this barrier’s high mission, while I am quite persuaded it very inadequately fulfils it, and produces far more evil than it appears to do good, I see no sutfi- cient reason against the prosecution of the study of syphilisation. It being admitted that we are bound to exert our utmost endeavours to cure the venereal, as well as all other diseases, I should like to know upon what principles we are, in the treat- ment of syphilis, to protest against the real philo- sophical end of therapeutics—the prevention of disease 1 Though no one can deny the moral bene- fits of syphilis are, in degree at any rate, question- able, that its material evils are numerous and certain, many may question the propriety of persisting in endeavours of problematical efficiency in lessening the latter, and of probable tendency to lessening the former.

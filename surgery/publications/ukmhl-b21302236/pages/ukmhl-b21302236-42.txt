20 survival of fourteen hours renders Rust's case unique. e. The most frequent co-existing lesions are rup- tures of the liver and spleen, injuries to the head, and fractures of the bony chest wall, but without penetration of the fragments. In 9 of the 28 cases analyzed, there was either no bruise of the thoracic parietes, or a very slight one. /. The pericardium is intact in at least one half of the cases. The observations relating to the condi- tion of the heartâ€™s texture are few; but they demon- strate that even perfectly healthy hearts are liable to the accident under consideration. Analysis of 22 cases, with a view to determine precise seat of lesion, gives the following result: 12 ruptures of the right to 10 of the left side; but the dispropor- tion between them is much greater, 8 to 3, when ventricles alone are considered. It is curious that the left auricle is more frequently the seat of rup- ture than the right, in proportion of 7 to 4. g. In the few cases which have survived, the symptoms have been those of severe shock. No other therapeutic indications occur than husband- ing the vital powers by keeping the body warm, and in a horizontal position of perfect quiet. h. The mechanism of these ruptures is twofold : Istly, by jerk of the blood contained in the heart;

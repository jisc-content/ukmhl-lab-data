40 axillary and brachial arteries on both sides. In the last named, it diminishes with the increase of distance from the heart. Both radial and ulnar arteries perfectly healthy. Atheroma and calcification in both common iliacs; the former, but not the latter, degeneration exists in both external and in the left internal iliacs. Bight internal iliac healthy. In dissecting the femoral vessels on the left side, nothing peculiar is seen externally. A good deal of atheromatous degeneration is discovered on lay- ing open the left common femoral, and also a small calcareous patch an inch above the origin of the profunda, which on being slit up proves to be perfectly healthy. There is slight atheromatous degeneration in the upper inch and a half of the left superficial femoral, but none in the remainder of its extent. On laying open the left popliteal artery, numerous calcareous patches discovered in different parts of it. The upper portion of the artery is obliterated by a red blood clot, but lower down by a firm white clot which extends down into the upper two-thirds of the posterior tibial; the remainder of this vessel is pervious. The corresponding anterior tibial pervious and healthy. The peroneal and plantars not examined. Ejght lower limb. Arteries. Unusual difficulty is experienced in dissecting the femoral vessels, owing to adhesions between them and the adjacent tissues.

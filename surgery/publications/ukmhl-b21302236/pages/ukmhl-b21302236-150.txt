122 with the greatest deference for so eminent an au- thority as Sir Benjamin Brodie, the report of the 115 cases of lithotrity which he recently read at the Medico-Chiriirgical Society, was not so full and cir- cumstantial as to exclude all doubt respecting the conclusion, inferred from them, in favour of the applicability of lithotrity to almost all cases of stone, and of its very decided superiority to litho- tomy."^ Without in any degree wishing to anticipate the decision which experience must eventually pro- nounce upon lithotrity as a general operation, I can- not but express a belief that it will only be accorded the merit, which most operators now agree belongs to it, of a useful auxiliary in the treatment of an aggregate of cases of vesical calculus; but that in the majority, removal of the stone by incision will be deemed preferable to crushing. I cannot but regard lithotrity as a much more serious opera- tion than its eulogists represent it; while, on the other hand, experience proves lithotomy to be less dangerous than might be anticipated from abstract reflection on the presumable effects of fraying a passage by the knife into the bladder amidst the very ^ My opinion on Sir Benjaminâ€™s communication is based upon personal recollection, from hearing it read and discussed, and upon a brief report of it in the Lancet (March 24, 1855). It is possible that careful study of the memoir so soon as pub- lished in the Society's transactions, may necessitate modification of the j udgment advanced with reference to it.

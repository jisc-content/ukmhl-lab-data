68 an invariable characteristic histological element, and that consequently, in its absence, cancer could not be said to exist. This was begging the ques- tion wholesale. Several thousand tumours, in- cluding all varieties, should have been examined and classified according to anatomical characters before a judgment was pronounced as to the dia- gnostic value to be attached to the presence or absence of certain histological elements. In the then state of knowledge, considering the history of the cases, all that we were warranted in, upon dis- covering the granular corpuscles, was to suspend judgment as to the cancer diagnosis; when, how- ever, after the removal of the primary tumour the cicatrix became the seat of a disease presenting the typical characters of secondary cancer, the only logical, and therefore the only practical conclusion was, that this was a case in which the so-called cancer-cell had not been discoverable in a tumour, though the antecedent and subsequent history of the patient decidedly conformed to the progress of cancer as clinically observed. Repeated and pro- gressively more enlightened microscopic inquiry has inspired me with the belief that the tumour of Catherine Edwardes probably did contain cancer- cells, but that from their being stuffed with fat molecules we mistook them for compound granular corpuscles. Of the case which first inspired me with this belief, record is preserved in my micro- scopic sketch-book. To the drawing of a large

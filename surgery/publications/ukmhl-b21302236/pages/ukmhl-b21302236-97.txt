69 cell with delicate outline and large coarsely granu- lar nucleus is appended the following note. â€œ This cell is from a cancerous nodule in the liver of a spinster, aged 70, whose autopsy was made in University College Hospital by Mr. John Marshall, on the 10th September, 1852. The left mamma was the seat of primary disease, not operated upon. My motive for drawing this cell is that in two large fields (one-fourth of an inch) it is the only one I have seen so distinctly, all the others being clouded by an immense number of fat granules, many of which are free, studding the cells and nuclei, so as to give the appearance of finely granu- lar corpuscles. On adding ether, only oil-globules remain visible; cells, nuclei, and molecules having apparently been alike completely destroyed. In those cells in which the cell wall is visible, it is very faint; the nucleus, where not completely hidden from view by surrounding granules, is very large. Was it such a fat granular condition of cells as this that gave rise to the appearance of compound granular corpuscles in Catherine Ed- wardes I think it quite possible that, with the aid of recent experience and more careful investigation, the so-called cancer-cells might now be found even in such a tumour as was removed from Catherine Edwardes. This surmise aside, the facts I have related, and the observations appended to them, are, I conceive, such that the case can no longer

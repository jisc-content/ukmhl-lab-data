212 nature of the pathological change. Having es- tablished the analogy between the vaginal and pleural membranes, in so far as regards the form- ation of calcareous patches in adhesive lymph deposited on their surfaces, I am disposed to be- lieve that thev also bear resemblance in the in- crustation of their surfaces with earthy salts when pus is deposited within them. It is easy to under- stand how a calcareous patch, the result of adhesive inflammation, may, in the course of time acting like a foreign agent, set up inflammation and suppura- tion, and how a similar result may be produced by a mass of cretefled tubercle in the substance of the epididymis. These suppositions granted, it would follow that calcareous formations may exist in the testicle as causes and eflects of suppurating cavities. More precise observations on these pathological states are a desideratum. h. Calcareous bodies in the epididymis, the re- sult of cretefaction of tubercle. The known fact, that in the testicle the epididymis is the seat of election of tubercular deposit, that cretefaction is the natural curative process of such pathological state, renders it very probable that the calcareous deposits, briefly mentioned in cases xii and xiv, as occurring in the epididymis, owe their origin to cretefaction of tuberculous matter. In case iv, the enlarged epididymis is said to have been the seat of an abscess or scrofulous deposit, the investing tunic of which was completely incased in bony deposit.

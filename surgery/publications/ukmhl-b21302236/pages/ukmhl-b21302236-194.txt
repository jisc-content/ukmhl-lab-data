162 adherent, but the wound in the tibial region was inflamed and suppurating. A piece of the case was cut out opposite the wound, to form a kind of trap-door to facilitate inspection and the applica- tion of dressings, without disturbing the rest of the limb; folds of lint were inserted between the case and the leg as seemed requisite to keep up pressure after subsidence of swelling; and the edges of the apparatus having been adjusted, a starched bandage was applied, leaving uncovered only the part where an opening for the wound had been made. The treatment of this man was henceforth simple; the wound on the tibial aspect of the extremity was dressed daily, and healed up in three weeks; he sat up in bed on the third day, and when about to go to sleep, always turned upon his left side. The only discomfort his leg gave him was that he could not flex the limb, as the case included the knee- joint; in two or three days, with my permission but without solicitation, he left his bed to go about on crutches. He was discharged from the hospital on the 2nd of June, forty-five days after the acci- dent occurred; the fragments were firmly united, and without any displacement; he could bear his weight on the limb when the apparatus was on, which latter was cut down so as to allow movement of the knee-joint. A fortnight afterwards, the ap- paratus was removed, and an elastic stocking worn instead, to prevent that oedema which comes on after injuries of this kind.

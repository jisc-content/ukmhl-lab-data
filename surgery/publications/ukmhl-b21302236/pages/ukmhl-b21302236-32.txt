12 pulmonary artery, the right ventricle and auricle dilate considerably, the contractions of the heart redouble, but its walls do not rupture.” Admit- ting the fact, its bearing is doubtful, if any. The causes which commonly produce traumatic ruptures of the heart, cannot operate so as to occlude the great arterial trunks, particularly the aortic ; and if they did, rupture of the heart should more frequently he noted in the left side, whereas the reverse is in fact the case. More to the point is a very interesting observa- tion by my brother John. While prosecuting his investigations in comparative pathology in the slaughter houses of Ferrara, in the spring of last year,his attention was particularly attracted by seve- ral cases of rupture of the vena azygos, which he associated with the manner in which the animals were killed—division of the spinal cord by thrusting a knife into the interspace between the first and second cervical vertebrae. He first observed, as the thorax was opened, circumscribed clots, between the pleura and vertebrae, covering the azygos vein; the blood sometimes trickling down beneath the serous membrane. On dissection, jagged ruptures of the bloodvessel were discovered. His friends. Professors Maffei and Balboni, having sought from him an explanation of the fact, he suggested (to my judgment very plausibly), that the instant the animals are pithed, the walls and contents of the thorax are paralyzed, the heart becomes an inert

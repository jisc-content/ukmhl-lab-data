203 solid matrix. Those cells which were deeply seated, viz., at a distance from the free surface, were'irregularly oval and spherical, and their out- line indistinct, the nuclei having a well-defined margin, and being, for the most part, coarsely granular. On approaching the surface, which was in contact with the fibrous tissue, the cell walls were scarcely visible, and some of the nuclei pre- sented an elliptical, others a fusiform and almost linear shape. In some parts the fibres could be seen extending, in a transverse direction, from the adjacent tissue for a short distance into the carti- lage. A very large proportion of the fibres being rendered indistinct by acetic acid, the cartilage nuclei then came into view; but their shape was so altered (linear), that their real nature could only be inferred by tracing the gradual transition from the oval and spherical shape. The intercorpuscular substance or matrix was, in some situations, homogeneous and transparent; in others, granular; and at wide intervals a few delicate fibres could be seen winding their course between the cells. A transverse section of the bone exhibited, though somewhat imperfectly, the ordinary structure of osseous tissue. The Haversian canals were sur- rounded by lacunae, which had a tendency to con- centric arrangement, but were not so regularly disposed as in normal bone; and the canaliculi appeared as tortuous lines, branching out from the sides and extremities of the lacunae.

139 of practical surgery. So important are the gene- ral remarks” in question, for their intrinsic merits, and for the influence which they exercised on the practice of surgery, that I do not apologize for quoting from them, such portions as contain Mr. Pott’s particular views. “ Neither extension nor counter-extension,” he observes (Works, vol. i, p. 385), “ can be necessary on account of the mere fracture, considered abstractly. The broken ends of the bone or bones are of themselves inactive, and, if not acted upon by other parts, they would always remain motionless. When any attempt is made to put them into motion, they of themselves can make no possible resistance; nor can any be made on their part, save an accidental one, arising from the points of the fracture being entangled with each other; and when they have been once, by the hand of the surgeon, placed pro- perly and evenly with regard to each other, they would for ever remain so. What then is the rea- son why fractured bones always suffer a greater or a less degree of displacement ] Why is a broken limb almost always shorter than its fellow ] What creates the resistance which we always find in attempting to bring the fractured parts aptly toge- ther '? Whence does it proceed that, when we have done all that is in our power (according to this mode of acting), the ends of the fracture wfill, in many cases, become again displaced, and lameness and deformity frequently ensue ] In short, what

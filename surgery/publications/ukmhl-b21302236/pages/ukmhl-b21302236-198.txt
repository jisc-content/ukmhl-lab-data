166 day, he was quite easy, and remained so afterwards. The apparatus was cut open from the toes to the groin, forty-eight hours after it was put on, and the thigh inspected without disturbing the limb; a few pieces of folded lint were inserted where it seemed requisite for keeping up an uniform pressure; and, the edges of the case having been brought together, a bandage was put on from the foot to the groin, and, having been smeared over with starch, ren- dered the apparatus as complete as before. I should have remarked, that the limb in every re- spect looked well; there was little or no swelling; and its symmetry perfect. From the third day, he got up daily, and went about the ward on crutches. At the eighth week, the apparatus was removed from the leg, and retained only on the thigh; so that he might use the limb in walking. It was not, however, until the expiration of three months, that he was able to throw aside his crutches alto- gether. He recovered perfect use of the limb, without any shortening or other deformity : I exa- mined this man six months after the accident oc- curred, and no traces of the injury could be then discovered: he had been engaged at his work for several weeks; and suifered not the least inconve- nience. I have selected this case from amongst many others equally successful, as showing how perfectly this apparatus may be made to keep up permanent extension, when opposed by the most powerful muscular contraction,‚Äù

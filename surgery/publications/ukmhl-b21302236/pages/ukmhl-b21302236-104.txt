76 The patient’s age, the very marked hardness of the tumour’s base, the slight retraction of the nipple, the enlarged and indurated axillary glands, were signs of cancer. Cysts, though rarely, are occa- sionally developed on a scirrhous base. The affected mamma having been excised on the 12th of January 1853, my diagnosis was proved correct by examination of the tumour, of which the following notes were taken at the time :—The elastic nodules at its upper and anterior part proved to be cysts filled with turbid serosity. There were three or four of them, each capable of containing a cherry-stone. The substance of the tumour was firm on section, but it did not grate under the knife. The cut surface presented numerous little yellow spots, about the size of pins’ heads, studding a whitish, uniform, and somewhat cartilaginous- looking tissue. At several parts were little masses of yellow, soft substance, which, under the micro- scope, were found to consist of oil-globules in large numbers, and of large cells, some of which were so stuffed with granules as to be quite black ; others, less granular, showed a large nucleus, and nucleo- lus in their interior. On pressing the tumour, milky-white fluid escaped in drops from the sur- face. In this fluid, as well as in scrapings from the tumour, were seen histological elements unmis- takably cancerous. I had been greatly aided in the diagnosis of the foregoing case, by having a short time previously

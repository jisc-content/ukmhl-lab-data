215 the testicle as a benignant formation or simple enchondroma, or as forming part or the whole of a diseased condition, having every resemblance in its clinical history to malignant affections. Ossifica- tion of such cartilaginous formations has, however, been but rarely noticed, though it is presumable that it would be a common occurrence if the tumour were allow^ed a sufficiently lengthy exist- ence. Case xLi, described in this memoir, possesses histological interest on account of the microscopic examination (page 201, fig. iv, v, pi. v). Bearing on the subject of intra-cartilaginous ossification of the testicle, is case xxix. Mr. Cunningham has recorded that, on cutting into the testicles of a yearling colt, he found one of them nearly all com- posed of cartilaginous substance, and the other so thoroughly ossified that no substance could pene- trate it. It is matter of regret, that the histologi- cal examination of these remarkable specimens was not carried out to the fullest extent. /. Osteoid of the testicle appears to have been the pathological state in case xxiy. The specimen preserved in the Hunterian Museum is certainly an extraordinary one ; the malignant character of the disease is indicated by the recurrence of disease two years after its complete extirpation. g. Development of bony and dental structure in the testicle as the result of fcetal inclusion. To this head I am disposed to refer cases xxvii, xxviii, XXXI, and xxxii, of the present memoir, as most

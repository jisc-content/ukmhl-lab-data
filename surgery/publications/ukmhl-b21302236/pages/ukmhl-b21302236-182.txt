154 description of the manner of preparing and using the plaster of Paris bandages. The best material for making them is unglazed, open calico. It is spread on a table, and dry, pow- dered plaster of Paris rubbed into it for several minutes, until the meshes are well and evenly tilled with the powder. The bandage thus prepared is rolled, and, just previously to application, sufficient ^vater is dropped into the extremities of the roll to moisten the plaster, but not enough to soak through rapidly, and thereby wash it out. The surface of the limb having been previously protected by a common bandage or stocking, the moistened plaster bandage is carefully applied. In a few minutes a very firm and accurately-fitting casing is the result, render- ing displacement of the fragments an impossibility, and allowing of the patientâ€™s movement, even to a considerable distance, without pain and inconveni- ence. This bandage being light, not brittle, and easily cut up, obviates the well-grounded objections to the plaster of Paris apparatus of Pieffenbach, as advocated by Muttray in his dissertation, De criirihiis fractis gupso liquefacto cur midis''^' Personally, I have not sufficient experience of this application to add anything to the commenda- tion it has received from distinguished surgeons of Belgium, Holland, Germany, and Pussia. So far The above description of the plaster of Paris bandages was published, with comments, in i\\e Associated Med. Journal, Sept. 1853, after my return from the Continent, where I learned it.

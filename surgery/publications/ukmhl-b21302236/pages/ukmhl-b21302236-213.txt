ITT testicles, bones, cartilages, chalk matters, etc., have been found: that the testicle has been met with ossified, cartilaginous, and containing isolated pieces of bone.” The invaluable pathological repertory of VoigtelJ is rich wfith information in point. We sometimes, he informs us, find little cartilaginous and even ossified bodies between the tunica vaginalis and the testicle, which are very similar to the little bodies occasion- ally met with in articular cavities. At first they are attached to the testicle or epididymis by thin bands, which appear gradually to grow finer, and eventu- ally to be severed, so as to leave the little bodies loose in the vaginal sac Wagner describes a testicle which had become converted into a mass of cartilage; another,completely ossified ; and a third, in which several pieces of bone were found. Yoigtel further refers to cases of a similar kind in the writ- ings of his predecessors and contemporaries. In the Observations on the structure and dis- eases of the testis, published in 1830 by Sir Astley Cooper, are recorded a considerable number of in- teresting facts directly bearing upon the subject under consideration. Sir Astley was evidently acquainted with the earthy deposits which are occasionally met with on the visceral and pa- rietal portion of the vaginal tunic. He refers the ^ Handbuch der Pathologiscben Anatomie. Halle, 1805.— Dritter Band, p. 385 et seq. N

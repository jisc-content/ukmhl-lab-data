155 as my observation has extended, it warrants me in regarding the plastered bandage as a very simple contrivance, calculated to be of great use in the hands of surgeons. On reference to fig. ii, pi. iii, will be seen a splint recommended for the treat- ment—at any rate, in its early stage—of a com- pound fracture of the leg. The pad at each end of the splint raises it off the seat of injury, while a few rolls of moistened plastered bandage so fix it as to construct what appears to be a simple and effective substitute for the broken limb. It would appear as if carrying the wounded man from the field with such a lesion would be greatly facilitated by that contrivance, while the materials and miode of its application are so simple as to leave no desi- deratum on that score. Whatever material be employed in its construc- tion, the modus oper^andi of an immovable apparatus is the same; we shall consider it under a hvofold aspect;—its theory, and practical effects. Theoretically considering the principle of action of an immovable apparatus, closely fitting as it does to the elevations and depressions of the limb, after the fragments have been brought into accu- rate apposition, it may be said to act the part of an outer skeleton, w'hilst the solution of conti- nuity in the bone is being repaired, giving to the soft parts that support which the natural skeleton once afforded. The surgeon applying an appara- tus of the kind, closely follows nature’s example.

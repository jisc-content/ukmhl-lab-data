No cancer-cells appearing upon its being submitted to careful microscopic examination, the diagnosis of benignancy was held to be indisputably con- firmed, and accordingly a favourable prognosis was pronounced. No notes were taken of the micro- scopic examination, but I perfectly remember ob- serving at the time that all the specimens which I placed in the field contained a large number of compound granulated corpuscles; that they were the most beautiful ones I had ever seen; and it w^as only then that I was convinced that the deli- cate objects depicted under that name in Lebert’s Ailm de Physiologie Pathologiqm^ really exist in nature. It is not irrelevant to state that I was in no degree prepared to discover histological evidence of benignancy myself; for before the operation I had tenaciously held to the opinion I had formed

163 ‘‘ Case hi. Fracture of the femur, oblique to the long axis of the bone, with unusually powerful contraction of the muscles giving rise to great dis- placement of the fragments, is the next case to which I wish to draw your attention, as illustrating the efficiency of this method of treatment in keep- ing up permanent extension by means of control- ling muscular action. John Ady, aged 54 years, by trade a painter and glazier, was admitted into the Queen’s Hospital on the 10th of January 1854; about an hour previously, he had fallen down in the road, which was frozen and slippery, and had sustained an oblique fracture of the right thigh- bone at the junction of its middle and upper thirds. I saw him before 9 a.m. : there w^as then much de- formity of the thigh with considerable shortening. The want of able assistants and the urgency of other business induced me to apply the long splint, but I was unable to reduce the fracture then com- pletely. Upon visiting him at 4 p.m., he com- plained of severe pain at the heel, instep, and peri- nseum, although I had used every precaution, by padding these parts, to protect them from undue pressure. I prepared to apply the starch apparatus in the usual manner: the materials having been got in readiness, I carefully removed the wooden splint, extension of the limb being at the same time steadily kept up by assistants. Finding this, however, inadequate for the reduction of the dis- placement of the broken ends of the bone, because M 2

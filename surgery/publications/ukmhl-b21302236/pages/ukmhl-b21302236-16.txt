ADVERTISEMENT. The ninth sheet of this work had been printed, and the tenth composed, though not revised, when I received peremptory orders, in August 1855, to leave England for General Percyâ€™s head-quarters in Piedmont. The printing of the remaining MSS. has been impossible before this. The dedication and introduction were also in type before my departure. The former might in part seem no longer to apply, as Mr. Guthrie is of the past. But he is still present as the surgical glory of the Peninsular War, and will never cease to be my benefactor. J. S.

92 the only cause of such deterioration is the incon- venience produced by the local disease, every one who has watched cases of cancer, can adduce many facts. By whatever method the disease is extir- pated, a moral and physical improvement takes place,—often in a very marked manner. Unhappily the same experience teaches, that this auspicious change affords no ground for abating the dread of recurrence, and the cases are not rare in which the surgeon’s suspicion is aroused by a peculiar feel or appearance of the cicatrix, while the patient’s excel- lent health is the cause of general hope that the disease has been radically cured. Sometimes, in- deed, the constitutional amelioration progresses, from the moment the primary disease is extirpated, in spite of the manifestation of secondary disease."^ While reflecting on the facts which Professor A remarkable case of this kind came under my notice in the Florence hospital in 1851. Not deterred by great emaci- ation, pallor of countenance, enlarged axillary glands, and cuta- neous ulceration of a scirrhus in the left mamma, of Caterina Lori, Prof. Ranzi removed it by the knife. A few weeks after- wards the woman left with the "wound healed, and her general health much improved. About three months later, while walking through one of the wards, I was surprised on being addressed by a strange-looking patient, a plump, rosy-cheeked little woman, who announced herself as the identical Caterina, again affected with cancer. The bare touch of the cicatrix sufficed to convince, that secondary cancer was present in a very marked degree. This only rendered greater my surprise at the marked improve- ment in the patient’s aspect in so few weeks.

Ill vigorous and very able attack upon syphilisation, by my friend and colleague, Mr. De Meric,and an impartial statement of its history and effects by my friend Mr. Henry Lee.*!* My opinion has remained unaltered. Certain it is, that in the study of syphilisa- tion, facts have been brought to light which could not have been predicated apart from experience; pathologically their interest is great,—how great, how conducive to therapeutic advantage, experience alone can decide, With the greatest deference for the Ricord school, illustrious almost as much for the fame and number of its disciples, as for its founder’s greatness, I cannot forbear stating a belief, that the attacks directed from it upon Auzias Turenne and Sperino have partaken too much of the charac- ter of party warfare, to command the respect only due to dispassionate and impartial consideration of facts, investigated by zealous and well-intentioned persons, for the cause of truth. My inquiries into the prophylactic powers of syphilisation have caused me to turn attention to the more general question of the prophylaxis against syphilis. I had intended embodying the result of these researches, when I became ac- quainted with two elaborate articles on the sub- ^ On Curative and Prophylactic Syphilisation. By Victor de Meric, Esq. London, 1853. I On Syphilisation applied to Man and Animals, pp. 194-232, in Mr. Henry Lee’s ‘M^athological and Surgical Observations,” London, 1854.

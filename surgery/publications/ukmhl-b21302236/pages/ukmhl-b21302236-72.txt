44 and is quite round and feels solid. On slitting it open, it is found completely occluded in its whole length by a firm adherent clot. The anterior and posterior tibial veins are healthy. One of the peroneal veins is healthy. The other is occluded by a tolerably firm and slightly adherent clot. Clinical Remarks. This case is replete with pathological interest. A few days before death, small dry gangrenous patches were noticed at the extreme parts of the left toes; on cadaveric inspection we found the corresponding popliteal artery extensively calcified and obliterated by a firm and in part white clot, extending into the upper two-thirds of the posterior tibial. The anterior tibial was pervious. No arterial inflammation was met with in this limb, but atheromatous and calcific degeneration were characteristically developed. It is curious that the extent of arterial obliteration was out of proportion greater than the amount of dead tissue would have led one to anticipate. This dispropor- tion has been noticed by others, but only Cruveilhier appears to have recognised its true pathological significance ; we shall presently have to recur to this matter. On dissecting the femoral and popliteal vessels of the right side, unusual difficulty was experienced owing to their preternatural adhesion to the tissues immediately adjoining ; that this was due to in-

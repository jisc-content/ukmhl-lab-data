216 closely according with what is known of the deve- lopment of foetal inclusions in the testicle and scrotum. Further observation must determine the soundness of this arrangement; interesting as they are however, these cases are not in themselves sufficient to enable me to add anything to Dr. Ver- neuil’s original memoir “ Sur rinclusion scrotale et testiculaire” {^Arch. Gen. de 1855-56), a me- moir replete with important observations. I shall conclude this memoir by observing that I regard rather it as instigation and help to future inquiry than as a positive addition to knowledge; the novelty of the subject and incompleteness of observations having obliged me to limit myself to facts and few reflections. The subjects of calcifi- cation and ossification are yet comparatively uncul- tivated, and promise a good return to the sedulous pathological inquirer. RICHARDS, 37, GRExVT QUEEN STREET.

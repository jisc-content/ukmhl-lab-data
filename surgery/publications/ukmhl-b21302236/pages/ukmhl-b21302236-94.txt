66 possessing the anatomical and clinical characters of secondary cancer may occur without any antece- dent malignant affection, merely as a sequel of the benignant growth known as cystic sarcoma. The evidence upon which this proposition rests I shall examine under four heads. 1. The case of Cathe- rine Edwardes ; 2. The case quoted by Mr. Birkett from Bruck ; 3. The second case reported by Mr. Erichsen ; 4. Mr. Paget’s cases. 1. As to the case of Catherine Edwardes. Her narrative was one of the most common among women labouring under cancer of the breast. The general feel of the tumour, the slight retraction of the nipple, the group of indurated lymphatic glands in the axilla, were confirmatory of the judgment to which the anamnesis pointed,—a mammary scir- rhus. The doubt of cancerous nature, and the diagnosis of cystic sarcoma rested exclusively on the feeling one or two soft points—supposed cysts —upon the surface. “ When a cyst is formed on a basis of schirrus,” says Dr. Walshe (^On Cancer^ page 481), “ an uncommon combination in the female breast, great difficulty of diagnosis arises, and is only to be overcome by a careful estimate of the whole progress of the case.” The case under consideration was precisely one in which very great importance could not be attached to the cysts; they were few and very small, and the patient’s history, no less than the chief facts ascer- tained upon her examination, coincided accurately

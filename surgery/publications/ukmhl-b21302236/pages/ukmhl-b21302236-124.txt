Arch. Gen. de Medecine. May 1855, p. 609 et seq. The MS. from which the foregoing memoir has been printed, was written in Vienna last summer, a few days after my visit to Dr. Landolh’s patients. Since that epoch his method of treatment has been experimented in the AllgemeineKrankenhausof the Austrian capital, and in the Salpetriere of Paris. The results obtained confirm the opinion I formed of the value of the chloride of bromium as a manage- able powerful caustic,—an opinion in which I also received confirmation in a conversation which I had, on my return from Germany, with Professor Vel- peau. As yet, however, no evidence has been ad- duced to prove that chloride of bromium has any more power than other caustics, or the knife, in curing cancer: that is to say, in preventing the recurrence of the secondary disease. This being a subject likely to engage much atten- tion, I subjoin a note of the publications specially dedicated to its consideration. I omit the many periodicals in which merely superficial notices of the plan are to be found. Bibliography.-—Dx. Landolfi’s Metliode der Krebs und die Krebsartigen Krankheiten zu heilen, von Dr. v.

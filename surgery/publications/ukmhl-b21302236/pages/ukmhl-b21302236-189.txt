157 Journal for 1855. At page 837 of that volume he has drawn up, in the following tabular form, the his- tories of thirty well authenticated cases of fracture, the reports of which were taken indiscriminately from amongst many others treated in like manner at the Queen’s Hospital. {See table at next page,) Mr. Hunt concludes his series of extremely va- luable papers on this subject with the following remarks. In the above table, it will be seen that the ages vary from early childhood to extreme old age; from "which it may be inferred that the method is adapted for any age; indeed, I have applied the apparatus, in treating a broken thigh, to a child aged sixteen months, and for the same injury to a woman above 80. “ Under the head of Fracture, in the table, it will be seen that the femur was the seat of injury in eleven cases; the tibia and fibula together, in eight; the fibula only, in four; the malleoli, either singly or together, in four; the patella, in one; the olecranon, in one; and the radius and ulna, in one. The bones of the lower extremities sustained the injury in every case but two, which may be accounted for from my not taking notes of cases which did not require admission into the hospital; and fractures occurring to the bones of the upper extremity generally do not; yet I have employed the apparatus in treating fracture of the arm and forearm as often as of the leg and thigh, and can as strongly recommend it in the one as the other.

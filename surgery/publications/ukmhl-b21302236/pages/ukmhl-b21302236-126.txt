Though these have for the most part con- demned it, Auzias Turenne in Paris, Sperino in Turin, Boeck in Christiana, Eetzius in Stockholm, and Siegmund in Vienna, persist in its advocacy: though it has been sweepingly condemned as chime- rical and immoral, numerous well-established facts connected with it, await solution ; and it has yet to be proved that efforts to lessen the evils of syphilis are contrary to morality.

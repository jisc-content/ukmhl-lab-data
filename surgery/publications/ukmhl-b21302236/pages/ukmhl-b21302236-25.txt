5 sive rupture of the right lobe of the liver; in it are several deep fissures extending side by side from before backwards, and from the upper to the under surface, so much so that at some points, only slight bridges of hepatic tissue prevent the great slices falling loose into the abdominal cavity. The other viscera of this cavity are healthy. Chest. Parietes sound. About a pint and a half of blood in pericardium, which presents a ragged aperture at its upper part; where adherent to dia- phragm, it is uninjured. At the anterior edge of the left auricle is an aperture capable of admitting a large goose quill, with uneven and ragged edges. The outward aspect of the heartâ€™s structure is that of health, and it is confirmed such, by micro- scopic examination. Lungs healthy, with the ex- ception of slight congestion at their bases.^ My researches having led to the discovery of other 27 cases of ruptured heart, bearing close analogy to the preceding, I have summed up their chief facts in the appended table(^^^VZ^ p. 22), and now purpose studying the clinical history of these lesions. The ages of the 28 subjects were very various; thus 2 infants, 7 below 21 years, 4 between 21 and 30, 12 adults not precisely recorded, 3 at 53, 60, and 70 years respectively. These facts confirm the very natural supposition that, provided the exter- ^ I feel much pleasure in acknowledging the assistance I received from my friend Mr. St. John Edwards in making this examination.

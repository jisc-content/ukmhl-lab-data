9 blood, without allusion to its integrity. No men- tion is made of the condition of the heartâ€™s texture in twenty of the cases. In one the organ was enlarged, its walls thin and flaccid ; it is recorded by Mr. Prescott Plewett; the seat of the lesion was the right ventricle, its subject a man, aged fifty- three, who had been thrown back several feet by a kick from a horse. In another case the left ventricle was hypertrophied. This case is re- corded by the same gentleman ; it occurred in a middle-aged man, who was thrown from a cart, and partly run over by it. The left auricle and pulmonary artery were ruptured. In the six re- maining cases, the heart appeared healthy ; of these, three were recorded by Dr. John Davy, Zannetti, and Prescott Hewett: hence the presumption that the appearance was real; it is stated to have been positively so in the other three, one of which, my own, was examined microscopically, two recorded by Mr. Prescott Hewett. The twenty-eight cases now require analysis to determine the precise seat of the cardiac lesion. It affected the right ventricle alone eight times, the left ventricle alone three, the right auricle alone one, the right auricle and other parts three; viz., in one right auricle and septum Botallii, in a second right auricle, septum and apex, in a third right auricle and vena cava ; the left auricle alone three, the left auricle and other parts four times; viz.,with pulmonary veins two, with pulmonary artery one,

As illustrative of the fact that individuals once syphilised are incapable of contracting the syphilitic virus, Professor Sperino brought under my notice a prostitute, who had, notwithstanding uninter- rupted assiduity in her vocation, continued free from disease since she was syphilised three years since. Granting that she has probably been exposed on several occasions to the actual danger of infec- tion, her immunity will justly be held to prove little in support of the preventative efficacy of syphilisa- tion, by all who reflect upon the not unfrequent histories of dissolute characters of both sexes, who, in a long career of vicious indulgence, have scarcely been interrupted by even a light clap, or a simple excoriated chancre. A large number of cases ob- served for several years can alone prove the point. According to Professor Sperino, some such evidence is at hand, hie thus sums up the cases, proving the curative and prophylactic pow^'er of syphilisa- H 2

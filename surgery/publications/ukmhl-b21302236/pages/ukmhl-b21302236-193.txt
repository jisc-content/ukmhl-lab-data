161 an inch and a half long with lacerated edges, and muscle protruding, three inches above the outer malleolus; another wound of equal size on the inner side, situated rather lower down, communi- cated with a comminuted fracture of the tibia. There was much sw^elling, with contusion of the soft parts, and rapid oozing of blood from both wounds; the preternatural mobility at the seat of fracture left no doubt that the fibula was also broken. Dry lint was placed over the wounds, and also a pad of the same material along the shin ; the apparatus was then applied as above described, but made to extend to midway up the thigh, and no cotton wool used. There was oozing of blood during the following night, and some starting of the limb, but the man complained only of numb- ness. On the next day, the bleeding which came from the wound on the inner side of the leg ceased. On the second day, forty-eight hours after the case was put on, it was found sufficiently dry to admit of being opened; this was done by cutting it up on the anterior surface, taking the fold of lint over the shin as a guide; one side of the limb was exa- mined by drawing outwards one half of the case and using the other as a support, keeping it applied to the leg with the hands of an assistant; and the examination of the other side was similarly con- ducted.

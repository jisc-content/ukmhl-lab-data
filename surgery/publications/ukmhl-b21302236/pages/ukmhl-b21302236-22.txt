2 of surgery are for the most part silent on this sub- ject ; which has, however, engaged the attention of some didactic writers. “ Le plus haut degre de Taction des corps con- tondants sur le coeur est celui ou son tissu se trouverait dechire.” Besides the conditional mood of the expression, the illustrious Baron^ adduces no cases in support. More positive is the actual President of the Boyal College of Surgeons, j* “ Lacerations and ruptures of the heart have fre- quently taken place from blows or other serious con- tusions.” Moreover, he quotes cases from Borellus, Vater, and Bust.f For its juridical bearings, this subject has at- tracted the attention of medico-legal writers. From Dr. Taylor we learn§ that, “ when the heart is ruptured by accident it generally gives way towards the base, and through one of the cavities of the right side Asa medico-legal subject it is worthy of note that when this alarming accident (rupture of the heart) proceeds from blows or falls, it is not always accompanied by marks of external violence, or any fracture or injury to the exterior of the chest.” Amongst writers who have especially studied Dupuytren, Lecons Orales, vol. vi, p. 310.

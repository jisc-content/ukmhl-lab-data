From 5 to 10 per cent, is the maximum mortality OBSERVATIONS ON THE NEAPOLITAN OR MOREAU’S MODikCATION OF LATERALIZED LITHOTOMY, AND ON THE EELATIVE MERITS OF LITHOTOMY AND LITHOTEITY. CONTENTS. Rate of mortality after lithotomy in Naples.—Description of the operative procedure.—Its apparent advantages.—Considera- tions on the relative merits of lithotomy and lithotrity.—Criti- cal examination of the statistics of the two operations.— Historical considerations.—Comparison between the opera- tions of Moreau, Ledran, and Aston Key, with the one above described. I HAD learned the very fortunate issue of the cut- ting operation for stone in the hands of Neapolitan surgeons, from the records of a brief communica- tion which the great Dupuytren addressed to the French Academy, on his return from Italy, whither he had repaired for rest, when labouring under the effects of his first apoplectic attack. But it was not until I visited the hospitals of Naples, in the spring of 1854, that I learned the precise measure of that success, and the mode by which it is at> tained.

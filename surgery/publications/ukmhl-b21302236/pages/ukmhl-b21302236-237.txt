201 ossified had been improperly used, and that most probably the hardening of the two testicles de- pended upon calcareous impregnation of the se- minal tubes, such as I had observed in the ram’s testicles above described. Butin 1853, Professor Fihppo Pacini informed me that he had examined the microscopic structure of the old man’s testicles, and found it to be in every respect bony, though the disposition of the histological elements was less regular than in normal osseous structure. This fact I verified myself later on examining a thin preparation of the same specimen in the pos- session of Dr. Magni. This is, so far as I am aware, the only well- attested example of the conversion of the tissue of an organ into true bone. The not inconsiderable number of so-called ossified brains of oxen, the history of one of which I published in 1845, are nothing else but intra-cranial exostosis, which by pressure on the brain cause its absorption, and by growth within the cranial cavity acquire its shape. The specimen of this kind which is preserved in the Veterinary Museum of Milan, deceived the members of a large scientific congress—Tiedemann, amongst others— as to its nature; Professor Ales- sandrini always insisted it Vv^as nothing but an in tra-cranial exostosis, an opinion confirmed by observation of other sp»ecimens in various stages of development.

207 2ndly. An attempt to classify the processes of calcification and ossification of the testicle and its appendages, according to anatomico-pathological characters, ivith clinical and thera- peutical considerations. The facts adduced in the preceding parts of this memoir, place beyond doubt that the testicle and its appendages, both in man and animals, are subject to a process of calcific and ossific degeneration much more frequently than has hitherto been imagined, and it would appear considerably more frequently than other organs. On the basis of these facts, the following scheme is devised for the purpose of conveying a comprehensive idea of the pathological changes under consideration. I. Spermatic Cord. a. Calcification of the vasa deferentia. I. Ossification^ in connexion with the testicle. c. Calcification of the walls of an encysted hy- drocele of the cord. d. Alleged formation of a stone in the cellular substance of the spermatic cord. II. Tunica Vaginalis. a. Calcification of pedunculated and loose bodies growing from the surface of the vaginal sac. h. Fine sandy deposit on the surface of that membrane. c. Formation of calcific patches and circum- scribed masses. d. Complete conversion of the vaginal tunic into a calcareous shell.

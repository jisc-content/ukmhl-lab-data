168 inquirer should be generalization; undue haste of course to he avoided, correct observation and severe reasoning to be adhered to. This branch of sur- gery offers greater opportunity than almost any other for reconciling contradictions and establish- ing rules, which must tend to the simplification of practice and the saving of pain ; and commensu- rately to the glory of scientific research and philo- sophic experimentation. While the multitude of fractures to which the bones of the human skele- ton (those of the limbs particularly) are liable, present great variety in detail, they have funda- mental characters in common, both anatomically and clinically: loss of solid support to the soft parts, preternatural mobility and deformity, and liability of the fragments to injure the surrounding soft tissues: hence the uniformity of therapeutic indications;â€”to effect and maintain reduction of the fracture, to prevent the occurrence of complica- tions, such as swelling and wound, and to remedy those of coeval origin with the fracture itself. These objects are all fulfilled by the immovable apparatus, which mechanically keeps the fragments in position without injuring the soft parts, para- lyzes the action of the muscles, prevents the occur- rence of swelling, lessens it when it exists, and allows of one or more wounds being dressed with facility, without disturbing the fracture. Additionally the immovable apparatus has the very great advantage of allowing the patient to leave

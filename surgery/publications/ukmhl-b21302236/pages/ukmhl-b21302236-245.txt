205 of the bone into view, little oval cavities with dark boundaries were observed; their appearance and arrangement were very similar to that of the lacunae in the piece of bone already alluded to, but no canaliculi could be detected. The quantity of ossifying cartilage obtainable in a section being extremely smmll, and the transition being appa- rently very sudden in the structure of the osseous tissue, from mere cartilage, with earthy matter im- pregnating the matrix, to an imperfect appearance of Haversian canals and lacunae, no sound inference could be deduced as to the mode of origin of the latter, or as to the mode of metamorphosis of the cartilage elements.'^ Case XLii. Fig. i, pi. v, represents, of natural size, the calcified testicle of a horse, which had been retained in the abdominal cavity, and arrested in development. The little body was white, fiat, smooth, and in every respect of chalky appeal ance. The cord attached to it was dried up but not cal- cified. Case xLiii. Fig. i, pi. vi, represents a calcified testicle which had been retained in the abdomen of ^ Fig. XII, pi, Yii, Tol. i, Descriptive and Illustrated Cata- logue of liistological series of Foyal College of Surgeons exhi- bits a vertical section of an enchondromatous tumour of the testicle, with cells containing a nucleus of bony matter.‚Äù The figure resembles, but is less distinct than figure iv, pi. iii of this work. I think it very probable that the histological process was alike in both cases.

146 to bandage firmly for the maintenance of co-aptatioii. There are, moreover, some exceptionally difficult cases,— e. g,^ fractures of the leg, with tendency of a flute-’mouth shaped upper fragment of tibia to cock up, and of lower one to be dragged upwards and backwards,—in the management of which, the Macintyre is very inefficient; and this for two reasons:—it cannot relax all the muscles, and is mechanically inadequate to fixing the fragments. The necessity of suspending the foot in a stocking from the toe, with a view to relieve the heel of pressure, operates as an active cause of displace- ment, by depressing the upper end of the lower fragment; and even though the latter be with- drawn from the power of the muscles by the division of the tendo Achillis, observation has proved that sometimes co-aptation cannot be maintained with this splint, in spite of the nicest management. In fractures very near the ankle-joint, especially when compound, and in all fractures of the leg associated with bruises or other injury of the foot, the Macin- tyre fails—often altogether. In children it is always very inconvenient. Much more generally applicable to fractures of the lower limb, and much more efficient, is the suspension plan, according to wffiich the broken limb is placed upon a padded board, having a piece of rope from one to two feet long attached to each angle; the four cords secured above in a knot, may be suspended by a long rope from the ceiling, or

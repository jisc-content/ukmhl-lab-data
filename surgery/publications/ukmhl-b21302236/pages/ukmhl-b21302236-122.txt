94 nary statistical account be published,—I am quite at a loss to understand how Professor Landolfi can have been so careless of world-wide renown,—to say nothing of the lives of thousands in all coun- tries,—as to be in possession of that extraordinary series of facts without making it publicly known. There can be no doubt that if he be in a position to PROVE that he has radically cured three thou- sand out of four thousand cases of cancer, a place will be accorded to him among the benefactors of mankind not second to that of Jenner. While reserving my judgment until the requisite mate- rials for forming it accurately are submitted to me, I must remark that all recorded experience being against the possibility of curing cancer in the ma- jority of cases, it is incumbent upon Professor Landolfi so to state his numerous facts as to place beyond question the correctness with which they have been observed, and give to every one the opportunity of forming an independent judgment. He need have no fear that the tribunal to which I invite him to appeal, will convert him into a Galileo before granting him a hearing. This will be most patiently accorded him by all who have at heart the advancement of knowledge for the relief of suffering, that is to say, by all whose opinion can be precious to him. Until the evidence I ask for be supplied, it must be held that Professor Landolfi has added to the long list of caustics a useful one, but that he has not proved his ability to cure a single case of cancer.

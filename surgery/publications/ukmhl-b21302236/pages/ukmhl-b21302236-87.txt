59 it in health and in disease, that even when to its study can he brought the aid of physical instru- ments, the task is one of uncommon labour, beset with extraordinary fallacies, as even the most sceptic may satisfy himself, who reflects upon the history of the innovation and introduction into practice of the stethoscope and microscope. The former has achieved its victories, the battle of the latter is being fought. Though there be ample proof that, but for the microscope, a large number of pathological facts of clinical value, now known, would never have been discovered; though there be good reason to hope that we have barely tasted its fruits; many surgeons in high stations treat it lightly, while others openly deny its practical utility. Cancer is the field on which its value to surgeons will in great measure have to be decided; and this will be immense, if, after ascertaining by micro- scopic investigation the anatomical characters of morbid growths, and classifying these accordingly, it can be determined that the anatomical characters of cancer are as peculiar as their clinical history; that a tumour not presenting the anatomical cha- racter of cancer does not entail upon its possessor any of the evils of this disease; and consequently, that in prognosis at least, immense aid will be afforded by the results of microscopic observation. It seemed as if this great boon had resulted from the application of the microscope; but there are facts on record in the writings of Mr. Erichsen,

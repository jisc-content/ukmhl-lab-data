XVI EXPLANATION OF PLATES. Fig. 3. Sir Astley Cooper, from whose work on the testis this figure was copied, annotates it thus : “ ossific body grow- ing bePreen the tunica yaginalis and tunica albuginea; ” more probably it was merely a patch of calcified lymph. Fig. 4. A section of the same ossifying cartilage as Fig. 5 seen with a lower power; it has a mapped appearance, in consequence of the grouped arrangement of the corpuscles, and the irregularly shaped masses of granules pervading the matrix. Magnified 150 diameters. Fig. 5. A section of cartilage in process of transformation into bone. The specimen was obtained from an enchondro- matous tumour attached to the testicle of a horse, within the tunica virginalis. The cartilage cells are seen arranged in groups, and masses of granules to pervade the matrix. At 5, the cartilage is impregnated with earthy matter, which at a, is seen advancing around a cartilage corpuscle. Magnified 300 diameters. PLATE VI.—Fig. 1. A calcified testicle found in the abdomen of a horse. The epididymis is in great measure indurated, and the body of the testicle is destroyed, but a bony case remains covered by dry tunica vaginalis. On one side is an opening, and in the interior are bony and membranous laminae, intercepting and partially filling up the cavity. It appears that the seminiferous tubes have been mostly absorbed and some indurated, whilst the specimen is principally made up of the calcified fibrous structures, interstitially disposed and covering the testicle. Figs. 2, 3, 4, represent a front and back view, and a longitu- dinal section of a piece of bone discovered in a cavity filled with melted fat-like fluid in a horse’s testicle by Signor Paolucci.

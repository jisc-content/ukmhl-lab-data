60 Mr. Birkett, and Mr. Paget, which throw a great doubt upon the reality of the discovery, if they do not altogether prove that a benignant tumour, though completely removed by the knife, may be succeeded by an affection in anatomical characters and effects inseparable from secondary cancer. I do not assent to the validity of the proof, because impressed with the belief that not only has not sufficient care been taken for excluding fallacy from the observation of the facts upon which it is founded, but that their impartial and rigorous study leads to conclusions, opposed to those which the above named distinguished authorities have infer- red from them. I shall first relate the case which has given rise to the discussion. Case i. Catharine Edwardes,^ aged 42, was admitted into University College Hospital, 9th June 1851. She was married, and the mother of two children. She had always enjoyed good health and regular catamenia. History of the present Affection. Three years ago, she felt a small lump about the size of a nut, very hard and readily moveable, beneath the integument situate in the right mamma just above the nipple, It is but just to state that no such correct account as the above has been published of the history of this case. The report in Lancet of 31st Jan. 1852, from which alone Messrs. Birkett and Paget could judge, is defective, both from lack of information, and incorrectness of the scanty amount it supplies.

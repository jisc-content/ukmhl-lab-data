36 The left subclavian artery is decidedly redder than are the other great vessels springing from the aortic arch : on careful examination, the redness is "seen to be due to capillary injection ; this is most marked along the concavity of the artery. This injection extends to five inches beyond the origin of the superior intercostal; as far as this point the colour of the arterial coats is deep red ; beyond it, they are of normal colour, but very much contracted. On comparing the brachial radial and ulnar arteries of the two sides, those on the left prove to be decidedly the smallest. On slitting open the left subclavian artery from its commencement onwards, an obliterating clot seven inches in length is exposed. At its proximate extremity, the clot is of dark red colour, smooth on the surface, non-adherent, of moderate consistence ; a little further on, it is softer, especially near the surface. Towards its distal extremity, it regains consist- ence, acquires a lighter colour, and is so firmly ad- herent to the artery, that on attempting to detach it, it breaks up. Just beyond the coagulum, the artery contains a whitish, rather dry, grumous substance, which adheres to, but admits of being detached from, the artery. Under the microscope it is found to consist of imperfect granular and pus corpuscles. It is to be regretted that I did not take more copi- ous notes of negative characters, especially as to the

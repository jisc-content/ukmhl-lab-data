148 movements of the body, and the action of the muscles of the broken limb, are prevented dis- placing the fragments. This will best appear upon comparing a broken leg placed upon a Macintyre, and one, similarly injured, upon a swing. In the case of the Macintyre, the leg is fixed to the ap- paratus, and this to the bedstead through the block on which it rests. If the patient’s body move, or the muscles of the thigh and calf otherwise act, their power is concentrated upon the weakest and most movable part—the seat of fracture-—the appa- ratus and bed being immovable; ergo^ liability to displacement. In the case of a swing, the motive power is almost completely expended in moving the apparatus, and with it the limb as a whole, and very little of the impetus is felt at the weak spot; ergo^ the less liability to motion and displacement of fragments. In this comparison, it will be ob- served that I have assumed precisely similar frac- tures, and equal motive power; but difference in the apparati, so far as fixity;—the one an immovable block, the other an undulating sling. It follows theoretically, that to ensure the great desideratum, —the communication of the least possible impulse to the point of fracture,—the swing should be as movable as possible, so as to exhaust in its undu- lations the motive power communicated to the limb, and thereby render impossible a jerk in any part of its length. Experience is in accord- ance. I was much struck by the attention paid, in

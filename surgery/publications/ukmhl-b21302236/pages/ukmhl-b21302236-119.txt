With it alone he treats m any cases, as he considers the other three ingredients of his paste not absolutely essential. In the rapidity of granulation and cicatrisation, and in the improve- ment of the constitution which follows this mode of treatment, I see nothing surprising or different from what we are in the habit of witnessing after the extirpation of cancer by other agencies. It is one of the characteristic properties of caustics, that the destruction of tissue which they produce is very speedily compensated by the granulating process; and this whether the part destroyed be the walls of a syphilitic bubo, the surface of a phagedenic sore, or a cancerous product.

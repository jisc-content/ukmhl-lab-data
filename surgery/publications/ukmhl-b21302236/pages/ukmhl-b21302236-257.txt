213 From its locality I am disposed to regard this also as a case of tuberculous deposit, with this differ- ence from the above cases, that the tubercle found its way out by suppuration, as is usual in the testicle, leaving a suppurating cavity, the wall of which became encrusted with earthy matter, a condition resembling those dwelt upon in para- graph a, under the head Testicle. c. Deposition of calcareous material in the se- minal tubes in various degrees, even to the extent of converting the entire testicle into a stone-like mass. Cases xxxvi, xxxvii, xxxviii, and xxxix, of the present memoir, illustrate the process of depo- sition of calcareous matters within the seminiferous tubes, from the earliest to the most advanced stage, that of complete petrefaction of the gland. The change appears to have proceeded without any sign of acute disease, and without participation of the constituent elements of the spermatic cord. The animals from whom the specimens were ob- tained were all ruminants, viz., two rams, one he- goat, and a bull; herbivora, be it observed, being especially liable to abnormal depositions of calca- reous and bony matter. The healthy condition of the tunica vaginalis in these cases, is further proof of the slowmess and innocence of their develop- ment. I am acquainted with no examples of this morbid condition in carnivora.^ Neither, to the Fig. I, pi. V, exhibits a calcified atrophied horseâ€™s testicle, but there was no appearance of tubular structure.

141 justly inveighing against splints which do not fulfil this condition. In order to form a just estimate of this teaching of Mr. Pott, we must severally consider his rea- soning, and the results of experience. Even in the present advanced position of the medical sciences, Mr. Pottâ€™s arguments in this matter must be characterized as ingenious and lucid throughout, much more did they merit this distinction at the time they were adduced; nevertheless they are vitiated by several important fallacies. Mr. Pott erred in only taking cognizance of the muscles as the cause of displacement; he seems completely to have lost sight of the physical laws which come into operation so soon as a bone is broken, at a greater or less distance from its extremities, at a more or less degree of obliquity. In the case, for instance, of an oblique fracture at the lower end of the tibia or femur, the fragments cannot maintain the position to which they are reduced, even after the removal of all muscular action; and this is owing to the displacing agency from gravitation of the lower part of the limb, as appears very obvious on observing such fractures in the dead subject: this brings me to the consideration of the next fallacy. Even apart from the displacing physical agency of the bony fragments themselves, Mr. Pott erred in assuming that it is possible so to place a limb as to render its muscles powerless; the posi- tion most propitious to the inactivity of one set.

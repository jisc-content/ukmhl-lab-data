196 sition that these little rods were the calcified tubes of the testicle was confirmed by examination of a portion of the surface, where pieces had been at various times accidentally broken off; here the little rods were seen to be very much twisted; many of them were broken across, while the bend- ings of others remained perfect. So closely did the appearance resemble the characteristic structure of the testicle, that when the specimen was shown to a distinguished anatomist (without any intimation as to its history), he at once suspected its true nature. Both in a transverse and longitudinal fracture, the interior of the tubes was found filled with a hard material, of whiter colour and less shining than the outer surface. The fragility of the substance having prevented the preparation of a section sufficiently thin to be seen with trans- mitted light, I examined the surface of a small piece sawn from the testicle in a transverse direc- tion by the aid of a lens magnifying ten diameters. The tubes (fig. vi) were thus seen to be uniformly filled by earthy deposit of dead-white colour in the interior; somewhat darker at the margin. Their shape varied; some of them were perfectly cir- cular, others oval or elliptical, and others much more elongated, and bent in the form of a crescent. This difference in shape doubtless depended upon the relative direction in which the tubes were di- vided; some being sawn directly across, others more obliquely, and a few lengthways. Many of

149 the hospital of Lausanne, to the carrying out the principles just expounded, and by the great comfort thereby accruing to the patients. The swinging machines commonly made by London instrument makers, are so heavy, and the suspending medium (often a chain) so stiff and short, that, practically, there is scarcely any provision for undulation; the heel is almost a fixed point, and the movements of the trunk, or of the muscles inserted into the broken bones, are little less effectively and prejudicially communicated to the fragments, than if the limb were placed upon a MacIntyre or long splint. Mayer’s motto was simiolex sigillum veri^—a truth always to be borne in mind in surgical appliances, particularly so in the treatment of fractures. The- oretically, and practically, the principle of sus- pension is commendable, and it is so in proportion to the simplicity of the means employed. Com- plication in mechanism impairs the operation of that principle, and is commensurately inadvisable. Dr. Reid’s suggestion of suspending broken legs by India-rubber bands from an iron cradle, appears a valuable one; certainly it is conceived in the right spirit and merits trial. It is to be borne in mind, that whatever apparatus is applied to a broken limb, it may be suspended by very simple contrivance, often with decided comfort to the patient. It yet remains for experience to determine what is the precise measure of utility of suspension in this department of practical surgery. The principle

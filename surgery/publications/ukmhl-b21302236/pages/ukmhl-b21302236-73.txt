45 flammatory plastic effusion, appears evident, when the marked development of the vasa vasoriim noticed on the femoral vessels is taken into account. That inflammation was not of arterial but of venous origin results from the following considera- tions :—a, the network of the vasa vasorum was more evident; its meshes were closer over the veins than on the arteries; the proper arterial tunics did not exhibit any signs of inflammation, nor was there any plastic effusion within them; c, the characters of phlebitis were typically well de- veloped, so much so, that the disease was evidently of several days duration,—an interesting fact when it is borne in mind that in spite of it the process of disjunctive absorption between the leg and dead foot proceeded actively, and at its consummation the stump looked red and tolerably healthy for nearly two days. In which set of vessels did disease first commence'? Were the arteries first closed by simple blood clots, or the veins by inflammatory deposits and their consequences, or vice versa? The dry and shrivelled appearance of the foot dispels all doubt in this regard; the arterial mis- chief must have had the priority; it is well known that just as oedema is one of the characteristic signs of venous, diminished size is of arterial obstruction. The right popliteal artery was very much cal- cified, and a small firm clot occupied the greater part of its bore, but did not completely obliterate it. Moreover, the anterior tibial and peroneal

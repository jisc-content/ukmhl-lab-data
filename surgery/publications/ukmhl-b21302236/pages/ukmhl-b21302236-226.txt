190 hesion ; which being done, the caustic clam was put on in the usual way. The other testicle I removed more easily, although it was far larger than is usually found in so young an animal. Two days after the operation, I removed the clams, and the colt continued well ever after. On cutting into the testicles after their removal, I found one of them to be nearly all composed of cartilaginous substance, and the other made up of bone, and so hard, that no scalpel could penetrate it. On re- moving its covering, all the rest of its substance seemed to be thoroughly ossified together, and in its present dry state it resembles nothing but a solid piece of bone as large as a hen’s egg. Case XXX. Calcification of the vasa deferentia testiculorum. The subject of this diseased condi- tion was Louis Poirier, set. 60, admitted into the Hotel-Dieu of Paris, on the 3rd April, 1824, under Baron Dupuytren."^ He died from sloughing of the integument of the scrotum and penis, the cause of which could not be ascertained. The vasa de- ferentia w^ere remarkably thicker than usual, but were not peculiarly abnormal in their course to the inguinal canal. From this point they almost sud- denly assumed an osseous calcified condition. This transformation affected them in the whole of their course to the prostate; here they resumed the or- dinary structnre. This was the only case of the kind that had fallen under M. Dupuytren’s notice. Legons Orales, vol. iii, p. 272-273.

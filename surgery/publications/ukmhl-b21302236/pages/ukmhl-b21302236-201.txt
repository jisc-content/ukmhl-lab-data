It may he objected that I have begged the ques- tion of the advantages of this plan of treatment, by attributing to it precisely those merits which are called in question. But I have not pre- dicated d priori; the cited experience is my warrant I am well aware, that not only has the starched apparatus been objected to theoretically, as tend- ing to produce constriction and gangrene of a limb, but that cases have been adduced to prove the correct foundation for tkat objection. In the numerous difficult cases which I have treated my- self and seen others treat by this method, I never saw one of the accidents in question ; I do not be- lieve their occurrence possible in the hands of a skilful surgeon, except as one of those extremely rare fortuitous occurrences which are apt to follow every operative procedure, and cannot be adduced as ob- jections to a plan of treatment, provided a sufficiency of well established facts be adduced in its support. The alleged insufficiency of the apparatus to maintain reduction, the condemnation of the prin- ciples on which it is constructed, particularly that 01 compression, were met by plain argument and eloquent facts in my former treatise; Mr. Hunt’s experience now comes to my support, and I have

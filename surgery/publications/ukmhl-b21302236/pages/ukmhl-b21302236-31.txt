11 vital powers by keeping the body warm, and in a horizontal position of perfect quiet. The Mechanism of these traumatic heart rup- tures deserves consideration. With a view to explain it, Dr. John Davy instituted a series of seventeen experiments (Op. cit. p. 452-3) on the dead bodies of men and animals, by tying the various great vessels in the neighbourhood of the heart, and forcibly injecting fluid into it. He summed up : “ The results of these experiments, in the way of illustration, as applied to the case with a view to which they were instituted, are in no wise clear and satisfactory. Considering them generally, they are perhaps less uniform than might have been expected, and hardly favourable to any general conclusion being deduced from them, excepting indeed the following: Istly. That the power of resistance possessed by the heart and large vessels, independent of any vital properties of en- durance peculiar to them, is enormous ; and, 2dly. That there is much variation in point of strength in the same parts in different instances.” Not much more conclusive, though certainly free from the objection which always attaches to experiments upon dead animals performed with a view to illus- trate occurrences in living ones, were the experi- ments of Chaussier (Portal’s Memoria cit.). He found that when the trunk of the aorta is ligatured in an animal, the left auricle and ventricle burst; but if the ligature be applied to the trunk of the

The condition of the smaller vessels has been singu- larly neglected by those who have studied this dis- ease ; and it remains to future pathologists to deter- mine how often, and by what process, the small arte- rial ramifications are implicated. While admitting Cruveilhier’s explanation of the disproportion be- tween the extent of arterial disease and of gangrene, as the only possible one, I cannot subscribe to his generalisation, that “ obliteration of the small arte- ries is the fundamental fact, as cause of spontaneous gangrene.”"^ The facts to prove it are not at hand. In addition to the reasons above adduced, what renders it about certain that the main cause of gan- grene in the right foot of Marianna Cerchi was obliteration of the ultimate arterial ramification, is the fact that the foot retained its normal colour. This would appear referrible to the complete exclu- sion of blood from the part, an exclusion so com- plete, that it can only be supposed possible as a result of closure of the smaller arteries ; for, how- ever completely the trunks might be obliterated— but they were not so in this case—some blood would reach the part through collateral channels, and by its change impart the dark colour.t Op. cit., p. 302^ -\ In the Med.

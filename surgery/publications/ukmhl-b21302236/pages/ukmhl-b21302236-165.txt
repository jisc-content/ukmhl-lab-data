137 of one age differ from the facts of another age; and the opinions of men differently educated, to vary, on what they are inconsistent enough to call mat- ters of fact.”^ The validity of facts has to be ex- amined before conclusions professedly based upon them are assented to. Such is the course I have elected to pursue. As we trace back to their origin the different methods of treating fractures, we are struck by the fact that they have multiplied with time, and that advance in this branch of surgery has been marked with a divergence from unanimity of opinion, which is generally held to be the representative of perfect knowledge. It is so, indeed, when it is the expres- sion of a judgment arrived at after free discussion of particulars, after impartial, comprehensive, philo- sophical generalization. Such was not its cause in the present instance, hut a servile veneration for authority, and a consequent enslaving of independ- ent thought. About the middle of the last century, two at- tempts were made to solve the then pending ques- tions in surgery, the one by the Academie Hoy ale de Chirurgie, who proposed a series of essays on such questions, to competition for prizes; the other by Samuel Sharpe, whose Critical Inquiry into the Present State of Surgery was given to the world in Sir Charles Bell’s Observations on Injuries of the Spine and of the Thigh-Bone.” London, 1824, p. 73.

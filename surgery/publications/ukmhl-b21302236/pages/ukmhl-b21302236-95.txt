67 with what we know of the progress of scirrhus. When, however, compound granular corpuscles, instead of cancer-cells, appeared upon microscopic examination, benignancy was no longer questioned, and the case was a theme of rejoicing, as affording evidence of the microscope’s extraordinary value, just as some months afterwards it was ironically dwelt upon, in proof of the microscope’s deceptive- ness. But were those who used the microscope infallible 1 They were myself and two other gen- tlemen habituated to microscopic investigation. We all agreed upon what we saw; compound granular corpuscles; we all believed that these only occur (as the predominant histological ele- ments) in benignant growths, and that the cell characteristic of cancer was not present in this case. Apparently the basis of our opinion was solid, hut very little will suffice to demonstrate its singular frailness. We observed and reasoned, assuming two things, neither of which was at that time proved: 1. That the so-called granular cor- puscles—Gluge’s compound inflammatory globules —only occur in benignant growths ; 2. That can- cerous growths always contain a peculiar cell, in the absence of which cancer cannot be said to exist. Our error was common to the great majority of those who have discussed the diagnostic value of the cancer-cell. We reasoned before the fact; having verified the statement that a peculiar cell is usually met with in cancer, we assumed it to be F 2

126 which he did not hesitate to perform lithotomy, Mr. Crichton cites several very remarkable cases. We have, therefore, 1,286 operations of litho- tomy with only 65 deaths: in round numbers, one death in twenty operations. But the result is even more favourable when the cases of children are examined. Thus, analysis of Mr. South’s table shows that of fifty-eight children operated upon, between the ages of one and ten, only one died. In estimating the value of these statistics, it must be borne in mind that, even if we had an equally large and favourable result from lithotrity, the result would be in favour of the cutting operation, because the numbers lithotomized would represent all, or very nearly all, the patients suffering with stone, who had presented themselves; while the number lithotritized would not give any account of those patients,—a considerable number, which, on account either of extreme age, or of enormous size of calculus, or diseased urinary organs, or ex- treme irritability, had been deemed unfit for the operation. I am assuming, it will be evident, that the comparison is made between exclusive lithoto- mists and lithotritists. I am well aware that this is not the philosophical process for arriving at the truth, but that the question to be solved should be, —is it possible, by adapting the operation to the indications of special cases, to reduce the average mortality of stone patients beyond what it would be if lithotomy alone were employed 1 As already

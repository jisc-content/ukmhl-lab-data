142 is favourable to the action of another. It is prac- tically impossible to lay a patient with broken thigh in such a manner as to prevent the frag- ments being acted upon and fro tanto displaced by the muscles. Mr. Pott’s inference in defence of his doctrine from observation of the position naturally assumed by broken limbs, likewise tended to mis- guide him. The bent position of a recently broken thigh is not an instinctively assumed one, but one consequent upon the destruction of the solid support of the soft parts, and of the greater weight of the outer half of the latter. The flexed and curved position of a broken thigh is no more intentionally assumed than it is during sleep or after death, and it affords no legitimate grounds for therapeutic application. Practical surgeons have, with rare and unim- portant exceptions, long been agreed that Mr. Pott’s plan of treating fractures of broken limbs is objectionable, on account of the very irksome posi- tion on the side, and of the difficulty of ascertain- ing the manner in which the broken bone is uniting by comparing it with its fellow in the sound limb. There can be no doubt, however, that the plan of treatment under consideration answers very fairly in a considerable number of cases. Here let me remark, once for all, that the above concession applies in greater or less measure to all the methods of treating fractures hitherto described ; many fractures are so simple.

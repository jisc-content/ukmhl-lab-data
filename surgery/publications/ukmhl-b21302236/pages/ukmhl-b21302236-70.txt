42 it open longitudinally, its interior is found lined by the inner coat of the artery. On examining the exterior of the cord, atheroma (proved microscopi- cally to consist of fat and cholesterine) is seen in it. This examination, carefully conducted, proved to me that the cord was due to longitudinal splitting up of the middle coat of the artery, contraction of the inner part of the said coat, including the lining membrane, so as to form a cylinder which appeared in the cavity of the artery; but what was at first taken to be the whole artery, proved to be nothing more than the outer coat with a part of the middle coat lining it. Venom system of the right tower limb. The com- mon and internal iliac veins are perfectly healthy. On slitting up the external iliac vein, its coats are of normal colour and consistence; in its interior is a conically shaped non-adherent but consistent clot, extending from half an inch below the origin of the internal iliac down into the femoral vein. On laying open the common and superficial femoral veins, which have a slate colour externally, with a fine net-work of very small vessels ramify- ing on them, I find their coats decidedly thickened throughout, but especially so the upper inch of the common femoral, where the tunics feel and cut almost like cartilage, and are very closely adherent to a firm reddish clot in the interior of the vein. This clot effectually closes the terminal orifice of the saphena. From the entrance of this

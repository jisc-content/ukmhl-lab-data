103 which one is, d posteriori^ indisposed to explain in a prostitute, as the effect of abrasion from exces- sive coition. As the onus of proof rests on Pro- fessor Sperino, no leniency in the shape of petitio questionis can be allowed him. He is bound to establish the diagnosis in every case by direct ob- servation, and exclusion of fallacy, so as to remove all doubt. Every suspected sore met with in the prosecution of his studies on syphilisation, should be inoculated at different periods of its existence ; but even then, if no effect were produced, would it be warrantable absolutely to deny the venereal character of the sore ? It would be so in the very great majority of instances : indeed, the exceptions are so rare,^ that I am disposed to regard the ino- I have practised inoculation in syphilis to a very consider- able extent, and have only known it to fail in reproducing chancres, twice. As both these exceptional cases possess special interest, I shall briefly relate them. The first was that of a young man, the subject of chronic phthisis : he had had a chan- cre at the freenum for about three weeks, and it had destroyed a considerable portion of the glans when I first saw him. Three inoculations with pus from the surface of the sore failed, though its own specific action was only destroyed by two energetic cauter- izations with nitric acid. Any doubt as to its true syphilitic cha- racter was removed by the youth becoming the subject of very severe ecthymatous syphilide about a fortnight afterwards. I was myself the accidental object of the next experiment. In February 1853 a little sore appeared under the edge of my left thumb-nail. It was very painful. Absorbents of forearm became corded; change of air and diet failed to do good. Remembering that I had examined a patient with urethral chancre a few days

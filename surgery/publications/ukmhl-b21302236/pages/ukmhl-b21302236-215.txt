179 of Guy’s are availed of, and the cretaceous masses of the epididymis are, with great probability of correctness, referred to cretefaction. Mr. Curling also alludes to the laminated calcareous matter sometimes met with in old cases of hydrocele— most probably owing to impregnation of lymph with earthy salts; he notes the small masses of hone which occasionally form in enchondromatous testicles, and he adds two cases, hereafter to be quoted."^ Furthermore, his work contains brief chapters on loose bodies in the tunica vaginalis^ and on foetal remains in the testicle and scrotum^ which are in advance of English surgical literature on the subjects to which they respectively refer. There being, so far as I am aware, no connected exposition and systematisation of the facts relating to calcification and ossification of the testicle, I purpose dividing this memoir into two parts: Istly. Documentary clinical evidence of the existence of these changes; 2ndly. An attempt to classify them according to pathological nature and seat. \stly. Documentary clinical evidence of the existence of calcification and ossification of the testicle and its apjpendanges. In the Descriptive Catalogue of the National I very much, regret that my numerous occupations vrhile engaged in the organisation of the medical staff of the British Italian Legion, prevented me writing this chapter from the mate- rials I had on hand, for the second edition of Mr. Curling’s w^ork on the testes, in which he had generously promised me a place for it.

I am aware, as was proved at the already quoted discussion in the Medico-Chirurgical Society, that other cases of suc- cessful amputation in dry gangrene are on record; hut they are only to be regarded as exceptions. Of nineteen cases of spontaneous gangrene, eight were treated by amputation, and five died; whereas ten survived out of eleven, in which nature was left to herself.^ These statistics are incomplete in parti- culars ; for it may be urged that the eight ampu- tated cases were the worst, and that the three sur- vivors owed their lives to the knife.

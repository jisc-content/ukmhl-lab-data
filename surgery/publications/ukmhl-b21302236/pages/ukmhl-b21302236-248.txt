Development of bony and dental structure in the testicle, as the result of foetal inclusion. It is now proposed to consider the above changes separately, in the intent of illustrating them by the particular cases, and directing attention to any pa- thological interest they possess, both in its ana- tomical and therapeutical point of view^ I. Spermatic Cord. a. Calcification of the vasa deferentia. Cases x and XX of the first part of this memoir illustrate this condition; the term ossified^ used with refer- ence to them in the Guy’s Catalogue and in Baron Dupuytren’s clinique, is almost certainly incorrect. From the fact that no mention is made of the tes- ticles in either case, their healthy condition may be inferred. It is worthy of notice that in those cases of partial or complete calcification of the

FACTS CONTRIBUTED TO THE PATHOLOGY OF DRY GANGRENE; WITH OBSERVATIONS ON ITS TREATMENT. CONTENTS. Different teaching of eminent authorities as to pathology of this disease, demonstrating desirability of facts to illustrate it.—= Case 1, dry gangrene of left hand in consequence of inflam- mation of corresponding subclavian artery.—-Analogous case by M. Chassaignac.—Critical examination of Dupuytren’s cases.—-Case 2, white dry gangrene of right foot, which spon- taneously separated.—Supervention of black dry gangrene of left toes shortly before death.—Autopsy.—Calcareous patches in coats of left popliteal artery, which were obliterated by blood clots.—Calcification and partial obliteration of right popliteal artery—White, firm cord in posterior tibial artery, proved due to longitudinal splitting up of its coats.—Inflammation of common superficial and deep femoral, and of popliteal, veins. ■—Clinical remarks.—Etiological considerations.—Observa- tions on treatment.—Dupuytren's practice.—Value of opium. "—Opposite plans of regimen recommended by Mr. Syme and Sir Benjamin Brodie.—Local treatment.—-Carded wool pre- ferable to poultice.—Question of amputation answered in the negative, as a rule, on the basis of traditional experience and statistics.—Summary. Much as this disease has been studied by surgical pathologists, since Mr. Percival Pott attracted prominent notice to it by the publication of his Observations on the Mortification of the Toes and

THE TREATMENT OF CANCER BY CHLORIDE OF BROMIUM, OR LANDOLFI’S PASTE. CONTENTS. History of the plan of treatment.—Its nature, mode of applica- tion, and clinical effects.—Alleged specific constitutional and local action of the chloride of bromium.—Critical reflections on the temporary beneficial effects on the constitution by the extirpation of a cancer, whether by knife or caustics. The latter preferable when capable of removing all the local ma- lady.—Chloride of bromium a peculiarly useful caustic for its very deep action, yet capable of limitation.-—Lack of evidence of its curing cancer, viz. of its preventing recurrence.-—Inju- dicious tone adopted by many German writers on this subject. —Experiments in the Allgemeine Krankenhaus of Vienna, and in the Salpetriere of Paris.—Conclusion.—Bibliography. Having learned from 'Dr. Combe’s work, La Mede- cine en France et en Italie^ that a particular method of treating cancer was pursued by Dr. Landolfi, a professor at the Ospedale della Trinita in Naples, I was anxious, on visiting that city for the pur- pose of inquiring into the state of its surgery, to ascertain the merits of the plan in question; but to my regret Landolfi was absent, he having been called into Germany, for the treatment of a noble personage, subject to the disease in question.

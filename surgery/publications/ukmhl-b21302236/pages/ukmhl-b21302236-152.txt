124 represented as having cut 1,547 patients without losing one. There can be no doubt, notwithstand- ing the merit attaching to Kau professionally, that his love of truth was second to his anxiety for self- glorification.^ Neither have I included in the above table any cases, the truth of which is not amply attested. The strict correctness of this statement requires proof in the case of Frere Jacques, who is said to have been obliged to leave Paris in disgrace on account of his disasters with lithotomy. Dionist tells us that more than one half of the Frere’s cut patients died; and Mery,J that of 60 patients whom he cut in the Hotel Dieu and the Charite of Paris, in the spring of 1699, 25 died, and many of the survivors had fistulse and incontinence. Admit- ting the correctness of this criticism, there is no reason to question the validity of the 171 cases. We Camper, whose ability and honesty are altogether beyond doubt, thus expresses himself: ‘‘Dubito etiam vehementer Rauo toties ex sententia successisse curam, quoties ipse gloriatus. Mille, quingentos, et quadraginta septem segros se sanasse jactat: numerum concederemus, si de curatione vel de sanatione agere- tur, silentio praeterit quod mortia fuerint. Diarium igitur, quod jussu magistratus in Collegio Chirurgico de sectis a calculo ser- vatur, adii, atque ex duobus supra viginti, quos Amstelsedami secuit, quatuor mortuos fuisse comperi: ex undecim igitur duos amisit: plures adnotiones circa successum curationum ab eo in- stitutarum, ad manus meas non pervenerunt.”—Petri Camper Demonstrationum Anatomico-Pathologicarum, liber secundus, pag. 14. f Cours d’Operations de Chirurgie, 4®ed., Paris, 1751, p. 244.

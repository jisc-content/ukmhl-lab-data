90 Professor Landolfi had a patient and unprejudiced, yet accurate and severe observer. It is simply just to acknowledge that theNeapoli- tan professor’s anxiety to give me every opportunity of judging fairly the results of his practice seemed to have no bounds. He introduced me to his pri- vate patients; and such was their enthusiasm and hope in the new remedy, that, regardless of station in life, they courted inquiries, which they strove to satisfy with alacrity. The cases I witnessed, appeared satisfactory proof that the caustic paste employed by Professor Landolfi is capable of eradi- cating a cancerous tumour, even when situated in the substance of the mammary gland; that such deep action is not prejudicial to the surrounding textures; and that it is followed by granulations which speedily fill up the chasms and contribute to the formation of a good cicatrix. Of four of the agents employed, three are well- known; the chloride of antimony is one of the oldest caustic applications to cancerous ulcers; the chlo- ride of zinc has been extensively employed since it became generally known as the active ingredient of Canquoin’s paste ; and the chloride of gold was the favourite caustic of Pecamier, in whose hands. Dr. Walshe informs us,^' it is alleged to have pro- duced very remarkable effects. Chloride of bromium, so far as I am aware, has not Treatise on Cancer, p. 219.

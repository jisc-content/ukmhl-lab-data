210 connecting pedicle is severed, and the body falls loose in the vaginal sac. These bodies appear in- variably to grow from the visceral portion of the membrane; in process of development they are liable to a more or less complete calcification. Commonly they are single and small, and appear to give rise to no inconvenience beyond, occasionally, an extra secretion of fluid into the serous sac. One of these loose bodies, about the size of a hazel-nut, was excised from the vaginal sac by M. Chas- saignac. This is the only instance to my know- ledge in which the abnormal growths have neces- sitated operative procedure. h. Fine sandy deposit on the surface of the tunica vaginalis. In Vidalâ€™s case of this kind (p. 178 of these researches), the case was one of old hydrocele, which it became necessary to treat by incision, in consequence of injection having twice failed. It would appear as if the fine sandy deposit and serous effusion were the result of old inflammation. c. The tunica vaginalis, as often recorded in the first part of this memoir, is liable to be the seat of calcareous deposit in masses and circumscribed patches. Case xiv proves distinctly how such calcareous deposit may occur in the lymph product of inflammation of the vaginal tunic, just as it is liable to occur under similar circumstances in the pleura. The specimen, fig. in, pi. v, from the col- lection of Sir Astley Cooper, would appear to owe its origin to the above named process, though it is manifest that when the drawing was taken, all re-

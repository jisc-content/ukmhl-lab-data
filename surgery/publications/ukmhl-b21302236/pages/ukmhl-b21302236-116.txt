88 To use Professor Landolfi’s words: “ Having for thirty years been at the head of a special clinique for cancerous cases in Naples, I have had ample opportunities for testing all the prescribed me- thods of treatment. The result has been my con- viction of their inefficiency; and I have been thus led to the application of the chloride of bro- mium. Having observed that chlorine preparations exercise a powerful influence in the treatment of gangrene, I bethought myself of trying their effect in cancer. Failure attended the experiments. Having learned that bromium had been extolled for its power of promoting the absorption of some deposits on which iodine was powerless, I tried bromium in cancer, but with no better result. Then it occurred to me to try a combination of the two agents, and ever since I have employed the chloride of bromium, my success in the treatment of cancer has been miraculous. My paste having destroyed the malignant growth, leaves a benignant surface, which readily heals, and, by an action which I cannot explain, the chloride of bromium so modifies the constitution as to arrest the pro- gress of the disease. That I am not able to explain the modus operandi of the remedy is of course no reason for discarding it, any more than it would be reasonable to discard quinine, when we have to deal with cases of intermittent fever, which it most certainly cures, though we do not know how. With equal certainty in a large number of cases does chlo-

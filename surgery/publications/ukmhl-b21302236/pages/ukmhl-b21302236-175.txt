147 from any contrivance over the bed. (Fi g. 3, pi. 3.) This simple apparatus is suited to any broken leg. Co-aptation having been effected, the knee and foot are fixed by means of bandage, or a folded half-square handkerchief, and any complication in the shape of bruise or wound befittingly treated. For a broken thigh, another piece of board is attached by hinge to the upper extremity of the one on which the leg rests, so that the knee and hip-joint may be more or less flexed : this thigh piece should reach to the trochanters, and be secured to the thigh and round the pelvis by bandage; but the suspension is effected, as in the leg, by a cord on each side of the foot and of the knee. Observation of numerous cases of simple and com- pound fractures of the thigh and leg, which I in- stituted a few years since in the Lausanne hospital, famed as the scene of Mayorâ€™s brilliant exploits in this and other departments of surgery, convinced me of the very great comfort accruing to patients, while under this treatment with fractures of the lower limbs, and of the facility with which good results may be obtained with it, even in spite of great tendency to displacement in consequence of the obliquity of fractures and of the power of muscles. A few words as to the rationale of the suspension plan. The flexed position of the leg upon the thigh, and of the latter upon the trunk, tends to muscular relaxation; but, what is more particu- larly worthy of notice, is the manner in which the L 2

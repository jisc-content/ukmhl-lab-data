at the same time, and a large portion of the tumour, as the preparation shows, protruded through the wound. “ Sections of a tumour, with the surrounding skin, removed from the same patient as the tumour last described, and from the cicatrices of the pre- vious operation. The sections display the same medullary character as the preceding tumour pre- sents, but the morbid substance is softer and more uniformlv coloured with effused blood. During %! O her recovery from this, the fifth operation, the pa- tient died suddenly. A mass of fibrine mixed with cancerous matter was found in the pulmonary ar- tery.” I think the probability is—in consideration of the patient’s age, the physical characters of the tumours on section, their frequent recurrence, and the eventual apparition of the disease in other organs,—that this case, though in some particulars exceptional, was from the commencement anatomi- cally cancerous and clinically malignant. It is a conviction that the march of knowledge suffers more from the introduction of errors due to imperfect observation and precipitate generalisa- tion, than from the slowness of progress dependent upon the difficulty of investigation, which has made me thus analytically and critically examine evi- dence tending to invalidate some of the most im- portant propositions deduced from careful and pro- longed study. If those propositions be not sound,

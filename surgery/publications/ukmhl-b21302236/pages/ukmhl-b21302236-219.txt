183 lymph product of inflammation, as occurs not very rarely, sometimes to a very great extent, in pleural exudations. Preparation 1909 is evidently a minor degree of the foregoing. It is catalogued thus: tunica vaginalis thickened, and fibro- cartilaginous; the inner surface of the sac is rough and irregular from the effusion of lymph. Case XVI. 1911. Partial ossification of the tunica albuginea testis and obliteration of the vaginal sac. From a man, set. 98, in whom most of the arteries were ossified. Case XVII. 1912. Portion of the tunica albugi- nea testis, with ossific matter deposited in it. From the same subject as Preparation 1911. Case XVIII. 1919. A small pedunculated body of an ossific nature, attached to the vaginal tunic covering the globus minor. The pedicle is quite thready, and no doubt would have been severed before long, so as to leave the little body free in the serous cavity. Case XIX. 1920. Two small bony concretions from the tunica vaginalis. These are evidently more advanced specimens of the change recorded just before (Case xviii). A circumscribed deposi- tion of lymph took place, became pedunculated, with time calcified, and finally fell loose. From 1913 to 1918, six Chatham preparations exhibit various pedunculated bodies hanging from the sur- face of the tunica vaginalis, and varying in con- sistence from flesh to cartilage.

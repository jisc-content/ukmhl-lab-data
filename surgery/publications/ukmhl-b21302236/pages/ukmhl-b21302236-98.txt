70 be regarded as an example of malignant disease affecting a cicatrix after the removal of a benignant tumour. 2. The facts of the case which Mr. Birkett has cited from Bruck as a parallel to that of Catherine Edwardes, call for analytical study. The heads of Dr. Bruck’s case are as follow^s “ A cyst, con- taining fluid and intra-cystic growths, was removed from the right mamma. The patient continued to enjoy good health for twelve years. A tumour was then developed in the same breast, which, with some axillary glands, was removed. This tumour is described by the name of carcinoma reticulare. The disease returned, infiltrated the skin around the cicatrix and the muscles of the mammary re- gion, and the woman at last died. The necropsy revealed the existence of several carcinomatous growths in various regions of the body.” From these facts I infer that the w^oman in question was the subject of a benignant cystic tumour of the right mamma, and was successfully relieved of it by the knife ; that, twelve years afterwards, the same breast became the seat of a primary cancerous tumour, the removal of which by the knife did not prevent the recurrence of fatal cancerous disease, between which and the cystic growth of so many years previously, known facts do not justify me in acknowledging any sequential relation. My right may be questioned to call the first cystic tumour benignant; I am induced to think it very probably

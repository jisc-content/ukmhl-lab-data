10 with aortic arch one; the apex two, the septum two, hoth ventricles, auricles, and septum one. Excluding six cases, in one of which the heart was literally smashed, in another the precise seat of whose lesion is unknown, two of rupture of the septum, and two of the apex, the tabulated cases exhibit the following proportion between rupture of the two sides of the heart:— Twelve ruptures of the right to ten of the left side; but the disproportion between them is much greater, 8—3 when ventricles alone are considered. This is a fact worthy of notice, as in spontaneous ruptures of the heart the reverse is the case, the left ventricle being much more frequently the seat of the lesion than any other part of the organ. Instantly fatal as these lesions commonly are, there is little occasion for comment with reference to dia- gnosis. When the individuals have survived, they have exhibited all the signs of severe shock which generally accompany the most severe lesions of vital organs. Only one instance is recorded of the super- vention of partial reaction, which is Rust’s extraor- dinary case (No. 27 of table). It is extremely improbable that persons with ruptured hearts will ever survive long enough to give opportunity for semeiological study; but even if they do so, no treatment can be adopted beyond husbanding the Right 4 8 Left Auricles Ventricles 7 3

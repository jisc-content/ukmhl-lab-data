152 and it acts in effecting and maintaining reduction, by virtue of the extension power applied to the foot, and the counter-extension exerted above, through the perineal hand. The circular bandaging from the foot to the upper part of the thigh, likewise exercises an influence in maintaining the fragments in proper apposition. There can be no question that the long splint thus applied, is an efficient instrument in treat- ing many fractures of the femur. It is ob- jectionable, however, as confining the patient in bed in a fixed position, during the whole course of treatment,—confinement peculiarly objectionable in children and old people. The use of the bed- pan is inconvenient, and, in consequence of the bandages becoming loose, it is necessary to re-apply them, and renew extension almost every fortnight; to the patient’s suffering, and, it is fairly presum- able, to the retardation of bony consolidation. But in oblique fractures just below the trochanters, with tendency of the upper fragment to cocking forwards and outwards; and in oblique fractures of the lower end of the femur, with displacement of the lower fragment backwards and upwards, the long splint is almost always an unsatisfactory instrument, often altogether inadequate so to maintain co-aptation it can be obtained extemporaneously : there are few patients, rich or jioor, Avhose houses do not contain a piece of wood that would answer for a long splint, and a sheet or tablecloth to wrap round it.”

The combined plan of position with sus- pension, as first suggested by Sauter,^ and gener- alized by Mayor,f from whom it derived its name, hyponartliesis. In the employment of MacIntyreâ€™s splint, advan- tage is sought to be taken of the effects of the flexed position in relaxing the muscles; of extension and counter-extension in effecting reduction and maintaining co-aptation; the foot being the part upon which the extensile force is exerted, while the counter-extension is kept up by the weight of the body. In a very considerable number of broken legs, this apparatus is consistent with excellent results: its employment, however, confines the patient in an uncomfortable position, renders the use of the bed-pan, and indeed any movement in bed, difficult if not painful, and is not unfrequently productive of very considerable suffering at the heel and ankle; particularly when it is necessary Sauter, Anweisuiig der Beinbruclie der Gliedmassen ohne Schienen sicher zu heilen. 1812. f Mathias Mayor, La Chirurgie simplifiee.

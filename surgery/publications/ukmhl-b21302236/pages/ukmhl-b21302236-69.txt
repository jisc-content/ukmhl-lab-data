41 There is a marked vascular network in the cellular coat covering the common and superficial femorals in their whole extent. Its meshes are not very close, but of bright red colour. On removing the cellular coat, the artery remains pale. This red network contrasts strongly with the external pallor of the left femoral. On slitting open the common femoral artery, no atheroma, but just above the origin of the profunda it presents a rectangular calcareous patch measuring a quarter by half an inch. In the superficial femoral is a little atheroma just below the origin of the profunda, and a small patch of it on the posterior wall of the vessel just about its middle. Deep femoral artery healthy. Right popliteal artery contains numerous calca- reous patches in its coats ; at about its middle the whole circumference of the vessel is calcified. Corresponding to this spot, the artery is partially pccluded by a firm adherent whitish clot. In dis- secting this artery, I have found it decidedly more adherent than usual to the surrounding tissues. On its exterior, which looks white, are more vasa vasorum than usual. Anterior tibial artery healthy. It is pervious except in its last inch, where it is occluded by white adherent clots (this is the side from which the foot separated). Peroneal artery healthy. Pos- terior tibial looks normal externally, but on cutting it open it contains a whitish firm cord. On cutting this cord across, it proves to be hollow. On slitting

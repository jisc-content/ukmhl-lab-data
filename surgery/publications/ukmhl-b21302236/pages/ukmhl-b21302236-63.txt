35 contains about two pints of turbid greenish fluid, with flocculi of lymph floating in it. The viscera of this cavity are healthy. About one pint and a half of limpid serosity in the chest; lungs healthy; heart small and flaccid; ori- fices healthy; with the exception of some calcareous deposit at the insertion of the aortic semilunar valves. Atheromatous degeneration manifest in the arch and descending portion of the aorta, especially around the orifices of the intercostal arteries. There is one patch of calcareous degeneration near the origin of the subclavian artery, and another above the origin of the coeliac axis. Firmly ad- hering to the last one, is the lower half of a blood clot measuring two inches and three-quarters in length, half an inch in breadth, and a little more than a line in thickness ; the upper half of the clot is loose, of dark red colour and rather soft; but the lower half is adherent, of reddish yellow colour, and firm. The right common and external iliac arteries are almost completely obliterated by a blood clot, the upper half of which is of darkened colour, more uniform shape, and softer consistence than the lower half. The middle portion of the clot, in- cluding some of the dark red and soft, and some of the light red and consistent, is firmly adherent to the arterial coats, which appear healthy. A fine clot is continued into the right external iliac for rather more than an inch. D 2

Appendix of cases.—Since this memoir was set in type, I have met with other cases of rupture of the heart from external violence without wound. They in no way necessitate modifications of the conclusions arrived at from the study of the twenty- eight cases. In last year’s bulletin of the Parisian Anatomical Society (p. 238) I read that “ M. Provent presented parts he had removed from a two years’ old child that had fallen from a window. They consisted of a fractured femur, and of the heart, on the anterior surface of which was an ecchymotic patch, measur- ing about two-thirds of an inch on its surface, and extending through half the thickness of the walls.

The case is clearly allied to the one recorded by Mr. Prescott Hewett (No. 10 of my table). It is to be regretted that the accuracy of his examination and descrip-

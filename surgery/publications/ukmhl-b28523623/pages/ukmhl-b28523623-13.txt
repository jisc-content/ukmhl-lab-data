When a Student is prevented by sickness, or any other unavoidable cause, from complying with the above regulations, he shall, as soon as the case admits, present a statement of the circumstances, with proper evidence, to the Conservator, to be laid by him before the Registration Committee, who shall report their opinion to the College ; and if the application be sustained, the individual so ap- plying shall be enrolled in the usual manner. 6. The Conservator will attest the registration of the Classes of each session by affixing a stamp to the tickets of those Classes. 7. Certificates of attendance [Ch. VIII. 4.] subscribed by the Teachers will also be required from all Candidates for Surgical Diplomas, in regard to that part of their medical education which they may have received at Edin- burgh. Similar Certificates will be received from any other Schools in which registration-books are kept, in regard to such portions of the Course of Study as the Certificates may embrace. Candidates educated at schools where no registration-books are kept, must produce Certificates from the respective Professors or Lecturers, both of their having entered to their several Classes at an early period of the Course, and also of their having attended those Classes with due regularity. And in the case of Practical Anatomy, the Certificate must express that the Candidate has, during the course of his attendance, been engaged in the Dissection of the human body, under the personal superintendence of the Professor or teacher.

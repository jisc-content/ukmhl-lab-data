NOTICE. Surgeonsâ€™ Hall, Edinburgh, 16th September 1859. The Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, in revising, from time to time, their Regulations respecting the Course of Study to he followed by Candidates for their Diploma, have been uniformly anxious to extend and improve the education of those who receive that testimonial of qualification, so as more effectually to secure that they shall be competent to perform their professional duties with credit to themselves and advantage to the public. In former editions of these Regulations, the College have insisted strongly on the great importance of a liberal education, literary and scientific, as a preparation for the successful pro- secution of the study of Medicine and Surgery ; and they in- vite attention to the 5th Chapter of these Regulations, which they hope will ensure that this very important object shall be attended to by the Student at that period of his course of study which precedes his Medical Curriculum. The reader is requested to observe that, in consequence of the recent changes in the mode of conducting the Examina- tions, it has been necessary to restrict the number of oppor- tunities for undergoing them to four times a-year for the first and six times a-year for the second professional examination. The Diploma of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edin- burgh is recognised as a qualification for Registration under the Medical Act.

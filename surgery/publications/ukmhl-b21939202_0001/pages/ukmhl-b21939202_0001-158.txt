146 The Opium was repeated each night; and the man went on without unfavorable symptoms until about 4 o'clock in the morning of the 37th, when the catheter and cannula escaped from the wound. He made several unsuccessful attempts to replace one or other of the instruments, and failing, the House-Surgeon was afterwards summoned; he succeeded in putting them again in position. May 2.—Redness was observed over a large surface in the right Inguinal and Iliac regions; and the penis and scrotum were red and swollen. 3. —The redness is more defined, and at one part soft and prominent. An incision was made in the Iliac region, and it gave vent to serum smelling of ammoniacal urine. 4. —The urine flows almost wholly through the incision in the Iliac region. The elastic catheter was removed, and replaced by one of a larger size. 6.—Incisions were made in the scrotum, on the right side of the I'aphe, and over the spine of the right ilia. Fluid, smell- ing strongly of decomposed urine, flowed freely from all the incisions. The urine which passes through the catheter is all tinged with blood. The man became weaker, and died in the morning of the joth, remaining sensible till within a few minutes of his death. The body was removed from the Infirmary, without my having the opportunity of making an examination. Remarks.—It seems to me that the unfortunate termination of the case was due to the injury done by the Patient in his clumsy and persevering attempts to replace the cannula or the catheter, when they escaped from their position five days after the operation. This is the only case in which I have found it necessary to puncture the bladder in a Patient in the Radcliffe Infirmary. The late Mr. Cleoburey, a man of large experience and one of the Surgeons of the Infirmary for 37 years, told me that he had never performed such an operation.

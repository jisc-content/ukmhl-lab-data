3o6 Treasurer told them at the last Court that he had not money to pay the bills.' It is a mistake. At the Court in April the Treasurer and Auditors reported that the quarter's bills remaining to be paid came to £ 1,300. In answer to a question put to him, the Treasurer (Mr, S.) said that there was £'i,^oo at the bank to pay them, — that there was a balance of ;^3oo after payment of the bills.

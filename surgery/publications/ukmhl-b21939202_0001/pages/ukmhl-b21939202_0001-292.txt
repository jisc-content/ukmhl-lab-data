28o Management, and printed and circulated by their order, I have the honor, as one of the Medical Officers, to submit the following remarks. The notice taken of the Report at that Meeting was irregular. The Meeting being held by adjournment from the Quarterly General Court of January, for the special purpose of receiving the opinion in writing of the Medical Staff, upon the question of the new wards about to be built, it was not competent for the Governors assembled there to enter on any but the special business which the Quarterly Court at its rising left to them. All the proper business of the Court had been ended at the former Meeting on the i6th of February, to which day the Court had been adjourned. If it had been supposed that any subject would be brought forward, but the special business of which notice had been given, it would have been in the power of other Governors to attend and take part in the proceedings, with — it is not unlikely—a different result as regards the Report. The opportunity was not given them to do so. The Report might have been dismissed with the remark that the writer, not having succeeded in the purpose for which he was employed,— ' Any attempt to unravel the respective influence of direct contagion, infected wards, or general sanitary state of the Infirmary or of the several wards, at this period of the prevalence, would be hopeless ;— ' It is impossible to state the respective parts played by this condition and by infection, in the development of the different cases of erysipelas :'— discusses at great length matters on which his opinion was not asked, — though, as might be expected, in some degree of doubt and uncertainty, being without ' a knowlege of the inti- mate working of the Infirmary, which is not to be gathered from a brief enquiry like this he has been engaged in.' The enquiry, of which the Report is the result, was made by a stranger, invited privately, — as I have before pointed out to you, — by four Members only of the Committee of Management, in defiance of the Order of a General Court of Governors, which directs that all Medical or Surgical enquiries shall be referred in the first instance to an especial Medical Committee.

The act is that of the Committee, not mine. The responsibility is upon them, not on me. 13 March, 1875. To THE Same. lyiY DEAR Sir, — As you do not refer to the question I put to you, — the meaning of your phrase, ' the grounds of my dissatisfaction,' — I assume from youi" silence that I gave them sufficiently. If you like, I will get some copies of my letter printed, and send one to each Member of the Committee. This may perhaps be the best way of preparing them to con- sider the question. If the Committee doubt what to do, why not refer to their legitimate advisers, — the Medical Officers ? This was done with Dr. A.'s letter. Several dif- ferent courses were suggested, by them and by him: yet a solution was found. What can it matter, whose ' fault' it is, — even if there is any: or who is 'to blame,'—even if anybody? Why are such unprofitable questions raised ? Surely it is the duty of the Managing Committee of a PubHc Institution to deal with a question brought before them by one of the Medical Officers. 15 March, 1875. To THE Same. My dear Sir, — Why this pertinacity in evading the ques-. tion ? However urgent you are, I must beg leave to decline the personalities. Assuming it to be the duty of the Governors to provide the necessary help, I have asked them to furnish it. I have told the Committee, in words which can not be misunderstood, what is wanted on their part. If you, or others, do not acknowlege the duty on the part of the Governors, discussion of the question is useless.

339 January, or yesterday, with the letter I sent. I now see I ought to have addressed it to the Committee. 20 February, 1868. To THE Chairman and the Committee of Management. Gentlemen,— On the 30th of October last I received from the Chairman of the Committee a copy of the Minute made by the Committee at their Meeting that day, upon the subject of the correspondence referred to them by the Quarterly Court of the 23rd. The Committee will, I trust, accept the following statement as a sufficient apology for the apparent neglect of the communication so made to me. They will see that the neglect has not been intentional. It having been the customary practise of the Weekly Board to make a report upon matters referred to them by a Quarterly Court to the Quarterly Court next following, I concluded that the practise would be followed upon the present occasion. On that assumption I addressed a letter to the Quarterly Court in January, the Court at which, as I supposed, the Resolution of the Committee would be reported, and taken into consideration. The Chairman of the adjourned Court of the 19th inst. has informed me that the whole question was referred to the Board of Management, — the words 'with direction to report to the Quarterly Court,' were omitted by intention; they were suggested, and deliberately left out. This is the first intimation I have had of the terms in which the Quarterly Court in October referred the paper in question to the Committee. Nothing appears in the Minutes of that Court to show that the order of the Quarterly Court was meant to be different from what had been done in other cases, and I did not learn more in my communication with your Chairman, Mr. S. Enclosed I take the liberty of sending a copy of the letter I addressed to the Chairman and Governors at the Quarterly Court. The importance to the welfare of the Infirmary of the questions involved in the correspondence urges me most Z 2

i8i Fracture of Thigh. Recovery without Deformity. A laboring man, 78 years of age, was admitted, 5 September, 1862, into the Radclifife Infirmary, under my care, with a fracture of the right thigh in its middle third, received by falling off a waggon when drunk. The ends of the broken bone having been adjusted, a long straight splint of wood, known as Liston's splint, reaching from the axilla to a distance of several inches beyond the foot, was applied and fixed by cotton bandages to the outer side of the limb, counter-extension being maintained by a thick bandage passing under the perineum, and fixed to the axillary end of the splint. The Patient thus confined was placed on his back. In consequence of some irritability of the skin of the peri- neum and the groin, I removed the bandage from the perineum on October 4. On the zgih the union of the fracture seemed to be firm, and I took away the splint. The Patient remained in bed for some days longer, as I did not think it was safe for him to bear his weight on the limb. The man had the usual meat diet of the House, being a portion of meat four days in the week. On September 15 I ordered a pint" of ale in addition: this was taken daily throughout his stay in the Infirmary. On the i8th, I ordered, in addition, a ounces of port wine at night: this was in- creased on the 20th to 4 ounces; and it was continued until November 3. In the beginning of November he was allowed to move about the ward with crutches, and he went home on the 12th. There was not any perceptible difference in the length of the two limbs. I have since been informed by a gentleman resident in the village where he lived, that he was not in the least lame, and that he frequently walked a distance of several miles. He died in May 1869,â€”nearly seven years after the accident. Fracture of Thigh. Limb shortened after Old Fracture of Leg.

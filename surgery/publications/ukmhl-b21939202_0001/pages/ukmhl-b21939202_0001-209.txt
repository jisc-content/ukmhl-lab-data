197 was seen to be moderately dilated, and motionless : he had no sight with the eye. Some feverish symptoms were present, unfavorable to the performance of any operation. I ordered that he should be kept quiet in bed. On the i8th he seemed better in general health. He com- plained that the pain in his head was now felt in the right side, as well as the left. Pressure over the right carotid artery relieved the pain on both sides of the head. But the left globe did not return to its proper position, on pressure either on the right side or the left.

A blister now and then to the back of the neck, when he complained more than usual of pain in the head, often gave relief: and purgative medicine was regularly administered with benefit. In the beginning of April he was removed to the Workhouse at Abingdon, under the care of Mr. Stone. The sight of the left eye was completely gone. There was rather a free serous

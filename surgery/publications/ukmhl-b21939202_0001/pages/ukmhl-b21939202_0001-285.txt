Porters will not help me, that I should get others on whom I can rely. 21 December^ 1865. To THE Same. The Patient has been moved ; and is comfortable in her new quarters. The Secretary forgot yesterday to speak to Dr. R. To-day I went to his house : he was gone for a ride ; the time of his return uncertain. I then went to Mr. Dry; and he has been kind enough to act. ' The Lesson for the future.' Are we to have this amount of trouble whenever one of the Faculty wishes a Patient to be moved .-^ It is a matter for serious consideration now that the Committee meets once a month, instead of weekly. What, if we have a case of delirium tremens, or variola ? 22 December, 1865. To THE Chairman. A Patient under my care in L. suffers now and then, (and is so suffering now,) in a way which unfits her, in my judgement, for being in the ward. I mentioned the case to the Secretary this morning, and I hoped that through you he could have got her moved. I have just been to the Infirmary, and found that it is not done. It is the Patient who was severely burnt. The 'burns' have all done well. But she has diarrhea and incon- tinence of urine. This, at any time, is highly offensive, and more so in this cold weather, when less fresh air is admitted, and with the ward full. If she is to remain in the ward, I think additional Nurses should be provided to attend to her, with two, perhaps more, fresh beds a day. I believe her friends are prepared to take her home. But I hope for her sake, as well as the other Patients, that she will be removed from L. without delay. . You are Visitor, I understand, and in that capacity, or as acting Chairman of the Committee, I should hope could use your plenary power in such a pressing matter. 8 March, 1866.

132 4- — Both testes were much swollen and painful; the right more so than the left; and the tunica vaginalis on the right , side was distended with fluid. 7- — On the right side I scratched off the small scab which closed the lower opening of the thread, and pus ran out of the opening freely. It was some days before the discharge ceased, and the opening healed. The swelling of the testes subsided by degrees. 13. — There being some fluid in the sac on the left side, I punctured it with a fine trocar, and let out some opaque fluid mixed with flakes. The man was weak, and much lowered in general health. I prescribed some Quinine for him, with Tinct. Camphorse comp., to be taken twice a day. Improvement in his health followed. July 9.—A small abscess formed in the scrotum on the left side. This was healed on the 20th. He was discharged on the 29th. The left testis was then of its natural size. On the right side there remained some thickening about the epididymis and spermatic cord. In July 1864 I saw the man. He told me that he was quite well, and had been so since he went out. In June 1878 I heard, through Mr. Sankey of Littlemore, that he had not had any return of the complaint. Hydrocele, injection — Return — Seton. A laboring man, 60 years of age, of rheumatic constitu- tion, was admitted into the Radcliffe Infirmary, 19 December, 1866, under my care, with Hydrocele of the right testis. It had been injected eleven years ago by Mr. Hester, with, I believe, iodine. On the 24th I passed a needle and double thread through it. Next day I withdrew one of the threads, and on the 29th the remaining one. Serum flowed freely from the opening. Very slight symptoms of inflammation followed. An abscess afterwards formed over the knuckle of the right hand. On the 18th of January following he went home. In November 1877 I heard that he had been well ever since.

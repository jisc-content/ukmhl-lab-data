184 to move about the house, going up and down stairs; but she seldom went out of doors except in a Bath chair. She continued in fairly good health to the time of her death, in February 1B75, when she sank from the gradual decay of a constitution naturally feeble. Fracture of Leg. Recovery.

The broth, the ale, and the eggs were continued till he was discharged from the Infirmary, on June 8, with the bone firmly united.

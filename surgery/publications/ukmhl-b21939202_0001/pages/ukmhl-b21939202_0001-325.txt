313 the Medical Officers of the week responsible for every thing during their week. It is now proposed that they shall not be allowed to interfere, — except upon leave from the House- Surgeon. But my objection extends beyond this. I think the House-Surgeon's first duty is to the In-Patients. The Rules require that he should visit the wards, (of course all the wards, and every Patient, and that Professionally,) to be able to report to the Medical Officers when they come in the morning.

You seem to forget the Rule that the Medical Officers shall visit twice a week at fixed times. The Rule is so well kept, during the week, that, I believe they always visit 3 times, —

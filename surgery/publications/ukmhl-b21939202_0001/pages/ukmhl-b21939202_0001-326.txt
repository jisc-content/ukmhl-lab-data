314 most of them 4, some 5, or even 6 days. The House-Surgeon can have no doubt when to expect them. The number of cases he would have to report, I do not beHeve would ever be 3, — often not one. You are aware, of course, that he keeps a book in which he enters cases he treats. You mention ' cut fingers.' I do not know accui-ately how many come. But I suppose not more on an average than a a week, — probably cases of urgency. No question could arise, if within the re- cognized rule of practise in a Hospital, — that the emergencies which arise must be treated by those who are on the spot. ' Aching teeth' you mention. These would be acute cases: no question could arise. As to other teeth, not aching, I am silent. You may remember I once mentioned them. In your enquiry have you not overlooked a Report by the House-Surgeon (30 May, i860) upon the increasing number of these cases ? 25 March, 1867. To THE Chairman of the Committee of Management. Sir, — In acknowleging the receit of the Minute of the Committee, of 16 March, I beg most respectfully to submit for their consideration, that the Medical Officers are the appointed advisers of the Governors in all questions of Medicine, and in all matters concerning the treatment of persons applying for the help of the Governors, — whether coming upon recommendation of a Subscriber, or applying of themselves without it; — that it is not competent for the Committee, without the sanction of a General Court, or without the approval of the Medical Officers, to withdraw, as proposed in the Minute, any of such persons from the consideration of the Medical Officers; — and that the duty of the House-Surgeon in the administration of relief on his own judgement, is limited to cases of urgency, (of which very few ever arise,) in the absence of the Medical Officers, or —at at other times, — with their concurrence, or under their direction. 16 April, 1867.

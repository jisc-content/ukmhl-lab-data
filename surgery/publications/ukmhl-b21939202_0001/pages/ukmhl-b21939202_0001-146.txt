134 himself with a needle, letting out the fluid about once every 3 months. I punctured the cyst with a fine trocar, and drew off about 9 or lo ounces of clear fluid. Upon examination, it appeared to me that there was also a smaller collection on the right side. The Patient was not aware of it. In August 1858 I let out the fluid from the left side,— about 13 or 14 ounces in quantity. He was now satisfied that there was a collection of fluid on the right side also. In February 1859 I punctured the cysts on both sides, letting out about 8 ounces from the right side. The operation was repeated in May i860, in the following November, in Sep- tember 1852, and in June 1863. About this time his general health began to fail, and he died in January 1864 with paraplegia. Some part of this gentleman's history I had learned from an other Practitioner, who had known him early in life. He never himself referred to it in his different communications with me. When a young man, he suffered from what was thought to be strumous disease of one testis. It ended in suppuration, and was followed by protrusion of fungus. This was freely excised, and the wound healed. He afterwards married a lady who had been left a widow without offspring by her former husband, and he became the father of several children. Upon the occasions on which I punctured the Hydrocele, I examined the scrotum, without drawing his attention to it, for the purpose of ascertaining whether there was a cicatrix, or other mark of former disease of the testis; but without observing any. The only diff'erence I could detect was that the tunica vaginalis on the left side was tougher, offered more resistance to the passage of the trocar than on the right, and that the cavity was of smaller capacity. The larger collection of fluid was on the right side, —the last afi"ected. It is not unlikely that the abscess of the testis was the result of the injury.

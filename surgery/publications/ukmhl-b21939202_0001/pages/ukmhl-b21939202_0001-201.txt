still existing in the subclavian region and inner flap. This slough, though partly detached, I left to be thrown off by- suppuration, instead of dissecting it away at the time of the amputation. The axillary and other vessels were then tied : they were all in a healthy state, and not plugged by any coagulum. There was not more than an ounce of blood lost during the operation, and none of it came from the axillary artery or vein.

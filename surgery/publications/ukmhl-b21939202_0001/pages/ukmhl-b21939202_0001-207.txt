He complained that this movement gave great pain; but it was done without finding much re- sistance from the muscles. The patella, however, did not move. The House-Surgeon, then standing at the left side of the bed, slowly flexed the whole limb upon the abdomen, so that the muscles on the front of the thigh became fully relaxed.

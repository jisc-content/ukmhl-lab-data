243 To THE REVD. J. S. My Dear Sir,—The Secretary this morning called my attention to a Minute made yesterday at the Weekly Board with reference to 2 Out-Patients admitted last Saturday with- out the Certificate of the Surgeon of the week, and to some casualties supplied with medicines from the shop, also without the Certificate of the Surgeon of the week. The papers for those Patients were signed by me under the impression that I was the Certifying Surgeon. If the Secretary, or the Dispenser, to whom the papers were taken in due course, had been mindful of their duty under the Rules of the House, this act of forgetfulness on my part would have been set right at once, without giving the Board the trouble of enquiring into the matter. When I discovered the mistake and told the House-Surgeon of it, it was too late to set it right. Perhaps you will have the kindness to submit this explana- tion of the oversight on my part to the Board at their next meeting. 26 1862.. To THE Chairman and; Members of the Committee OF Management. Gentlemen,—Referring to No. 44 of the printed Rules,— ' That all Patients shall be and continue under the care of the' Physician or Surgeon, (and in mixed cases of both,) whose turn it was to attend when they were admitted,' —I learn that in the week lately passed a Patient was admitted who has been subjected to a Surgical operation or examination by one of the other Surgeons,—not being the one ' whose turn it was to attend.'- I call attention to the irregularity. It appears that the Patient was not admitted on Wednesday, in the regular way, by the Committee. I do not know whether she came into the House with the authority of the Committee, or whether there was any urgency in her case rendering it neces- sary to dispense with it. I November, 1870. R 2

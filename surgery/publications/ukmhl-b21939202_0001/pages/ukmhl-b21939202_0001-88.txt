76 force of sufificient power, there ai'e features in the wounds caused by the metallic projectiles used in war, which have been recognised from the time of the introduction of fire- arms, and which have marked out gunshot wounds as a subject of special interest. The educational requirements of modern times point them out also as a subject of additional study to the Student who proposes to qualify himself for the military branch of the public service. Injuries from pieces of stone set free in the process of blasting rocks, or by the accidental flying asunder of a faulty mill-wheel, will not present features materially different from the contused and lacerated wounds caused by fragments struck from a parapet or an exploded mine. The fragments of metallic vessels burst asunder by the expansive power of steam, may cause wounds presenting some of the characteristics of those caused by the explosion of a shell. But the military bullet, as an instrument of direct violence, in its passage through the trunk or extremities, causes a wound presenting features of its own, widely different from the accidents of civil life, though equally destructive of life or limb. The bolts of the archer, where they did not destroy life, have not been recorded by con- temporary historians as leaving wounds of a very formidable character: the crushing on a railway, and the destructive effects of modern machinery, in the factory or on the farm, are essentially different in many of their chief features from the lesions effected by the shot or shell of the military engineer. Mr. Longmore gives a short review of the history and literature of this branch of Surgery; and he points with V^fpride and satisfaction to the fact that, in leading the way to a more practical knowlege of the nature and proper treatment of these injuries, the older English military Surgeons stand forth conspicuously, though they have written less volu- minously than the Continental Surgeons. In considering the varieties of gun-shot wounds, as they come under the notice of the Army Surgeon, modified by the form and kind of missiles, the degree of force with which they are propelled, and by the seat of injury in the Patient, the part of his body struck, and its position relative to the pro- jectile at the time of injury, Mr. Longmore has instituted a

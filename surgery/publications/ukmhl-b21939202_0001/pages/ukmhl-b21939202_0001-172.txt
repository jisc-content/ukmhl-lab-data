The catheter was left in position,^ and the urine was allowed to escape through it. So efifectively was the object attained, that no further discharge took place through the false channel. The whole of the wound united by first intention. At the end of a week the catheter was changed, and replaced by an other; and this other was allowed to remain for about an other week. On November 3 the man was discharged, with the opening completely closed. For some months he was unable to empty the bladder without the help of a catheter.

From en- quiry I have since made of members of his family, I believe that he had no return of his former complaint to the time of his death, which happened several years afterwards. {Medical Times and Gazette, 17 May, 1879.] Calculus Extracted from the Female Bladder.

48 In the evening it returned. Gradually he became exhausted ; and he died between i and 3 o'clock on Thursday morning (the 22nd). Remarks.—The man never rallied from the effects of the great loss of blood. His death is to be attributed to that circumstance. The gangrene did not reach as far as the knee; and if his general symptoms would have justified the operation, amputation could have been performed in the thigh through healthy structures above the seat of injury. The appearance of the gangrene would not of itself have been against the operation. The case of the cartridge was found in the lower part of the leg by the side of the tendo Achillis. The greater part of the shot was scattered irregularly, and buried in the muscular sub- stance of the calf. Some few of the shots were merely under the skin. The state of the nerves and vessels was not traced in the examination which was made. Gunshot Wound of Popliteal Space. Wound of Vein— Hemorrhage—Death. A young man, 19 years of age, was admitted into the Rad- cliffe Infirmary, under my care, in the middle of the night, 17 January, 1851, exhausted by loss of blood from a large open wound in the right Popliteal space. The injury was received early in the day, 16 miles from Oxford, by the accidental discharge, within 2 or 3 feet of him, of a fowling-piece loaded with small shot. The assistance of a 'water-doctor,' much consulted by the ignorant people of the neighborhood, was obtained; but the man would not undertake the treatment of the case. Late in the evening he put the lad into a carriage and brought him to the Infirmary, 14 hours after the accident. He died 4 hours after admission. A portion of integument about the size of the palm of the hand was gone, and the muscles were much lacerated. A large opening was seen in the Popliteal vein. The artery was bruised, but not opened.

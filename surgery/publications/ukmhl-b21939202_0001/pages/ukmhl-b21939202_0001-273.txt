26l commending that a large reduction shall be made at once in the number of beds now in the House. The ground on which he puts the recommendation is ' the tainted condition of the House in many of its wards,' It is remarkable that in the course of a long printed paper he makes no reference to the Medical Officers, or their opinion, — that he does not seek for support from Officers whose personal experience of the House, and of its value as a place for the treatment of the sick, extends over a period of from 20 to 30 years. , Without any wish to call in question the power of the Governors to take the whole management of the House and the sick into their own hands at any moment, I venture, as one of the Medical Officers, to suggest, as a matter of pru- dence, — if not of courtesy toward Officers who have served them long and faithfully, — that they should call for the opinion of the Medical Officers, or the Medical Committee, before they take, at Mr. S.'s recommendation, a course so unusual as that proposed by him. Governors will forgive me if I remind them that the re- sponsibility of the Medical Officers of a Public Institution ceases when Governors interfere; aiid that, as they incline to a course which involves an interference in what is uni- versally considered the special department of the Medical Officers, such an interference, — however light their hand, — must have the effect of lowering the character of the Medical Officers, aild thus far lessening their influence, and their power to do good. It can not be expected that the many servants now under their orders can serve usefully or cheerfully, when they see what they think an indignity put upon Officers to whom they have long looked to lead them in their difficult task, and to guide them in its varying scenes. The state of the wards and the House in general, as likely to have effect upon the health of the Patients or others re- sident within the walls, has always had a large share of our attention. The part I have taken, — on the different questions that have been raised from time to time, may be seen to some extent in the following papers But, a man gets tired of making suggestions, when he finds his suggestions do not receive attention.

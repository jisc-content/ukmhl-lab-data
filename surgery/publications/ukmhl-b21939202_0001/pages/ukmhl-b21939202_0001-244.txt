232 suffrages went in favor of the system, which claims humanity to the victim, and improved quality and quantity of food to the consumer, as its peculiar merits. I am, &c., Delta. To THE Same. Sir,—Referring to the remarks in the Medical Times and Gazette of this week, I venture, as a Prescribing Practitioner of 30 years' standing, to submit my opinion that a Practitioner can not be considered answerable for a mishap in the use of a prescription after the expiration of the period allowed by the prescription for taking the medicines prescribed. If, for instance, a prescription is given for a mixture, of which a sixth part is to be taken at bed-time, the responsibility of the Pre- scriber is sufficiently defined. At the end of a week the prescription is out of date ; it has expired from efflux of time, as the Lawyers say. Whatever latitude may be allowed to a Patient in the use of a prescription, without fresh directions from the Prescriber, it is obvious that the Prescriber is not answerable for the consequences of continuing the use of the medicine for an indefinite period, or for taking it in irregular doses. December 1879. To THE Same. Sir, — The Secretaries of the B. Medico-Ethical Society ask whether your readers can suggest any check in giving relief at general or special Hospitals to those who are able to pay for private advice : they are anxious to hear of a remedy. The remedy. Sir, is in the hands of the Medical Officers. As long as the Medical Officers of those Institutions find their own advantage in encouraging the visits of the well-to-do Patients, the attendance of those persons will continue. The Governors could not introduce such persons to the benefits, — or the abuses, — of the charity against the will of the Medical Officers. The same may be said of the Dispensaries, Provident Institutions, and Benefit Clubs, which are even to a greater extent infested by persons able to pay a Practitioner for their relief. January 1880.

175 family, and a free drinker, was admitted into the Radcliffe Infirmary, under my care, 4 April, 1863, with a compound fracture of both bones of the left leg, extending into the ankle-joint, and with a large bruise on the sacrum. The injuries were received in a fall downstairs when in a state of drunkenness. The limb was adjusted, and placed in splints in a good position. Some time after admission she suffered from a troublesome attack of diarrhea ; but this subsided under the administration of Pulv. Cretse comp., with Opium and Kino. Erysipelas afterwards appeared on the limb. This was fol- lowed by suppuration in the deep-seated parts, with sloughing of fascia and tendons. All appearance of reparative process ceased. The bones of the ankle-joint and tarsus were exposed in the wound, and the cartilage had disappeared from the articular surfaces. Notwithstanding the allowance of a generous diet, with brandy, her strength began to decline; and, as there was no hope of a union of the bones, or even of a restorative action being established, the leg was amputated on 15 May. On the 24th she complained of sore throat, with difficulty of swallowing. Next day the jaw was fixed, and the general symptoms of Tetanus declared themselves. She died early in the morning of the 28th. A carpenter, 26 years of age, not a man of strong constitu- tional power, was admitted into the Radcliffe Infirmary, 13 February, 1871, under my care, with a fracture of both bones of his leg in the middle third. (A full report of the case is given at p. 33.) Abscesses formed in the leg, followed by several attacks of hemorrhage of a venous character. The ankle-joint became disorganized. The leg was amputated 21 March. An abscess formed in the thigh, followed by attacks of hemorrhage, for which it was necessary to remove the dressings and open the stump. The man became weaker, and died exhausted on 17 April. A carrier, 37 years of age, laboring under delirium tremens,

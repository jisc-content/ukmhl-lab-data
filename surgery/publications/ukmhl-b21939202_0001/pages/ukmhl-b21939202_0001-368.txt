356 for the prisoner, refused it, with the remark that he did not see what advantage it would be to her, â€” a reason clear enough from the prisoner's point of view. The period of ad- journment would have given time for enquiry, for the action of the Police, and the Magistrates ; and with other evidence, at an other Assize, an other verdict might have been found. In the case of the Welsh fasting girl, in 1870, the omission to return depositions and bind over witnesses was discovered on the eve of the Assizes, and the trial was adjourned by order of the Chief Justice Bovill, to enable the Magistrates to complete the necessary investigation. After some loose and inaccurate evidence of the nature of the operation, and the effects which followed, had been given in Court, it became necessary to say what was the operation really performed, and what was the cause of death ; and there was no other course but to call me as a witness.

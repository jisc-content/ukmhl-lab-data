379 that the Deputy had no power to act in such a case. Upon production of an extract from the Statute-book, the Judge openly, and in terms as plain as a Judge speaking from the Bench can use, admitted that I was right in the interpretation I put on a modern Act of Parliament. Some remarks fell from the Bench on the state of the law under which a Coroner, if a Medical Practitioner, was required to hold an Inquest in the case of a person who had been a Patient under his care.

He once told the Committee that he would not submit to have his will controlled by a General Court of Governors ; that he would have his opinion put upon the Minutes whether the Governors liked it or not.

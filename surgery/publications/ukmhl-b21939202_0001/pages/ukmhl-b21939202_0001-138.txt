126 October 25.—I tapped the left side, and let out 8 ounces of fluid. November 28, I repeated the operation, and let out about the same quantity. He was readmitted 2 March, 1859. On the 7th I passed a single thread of fine iron wire through the sac. Some little enlargement of the testis fol- lowed, but the boy did not complain of pain. On the 12th I withdrew the threa'ti. April 11.—The fluid had increased in quantity. I again passed a thread of iron wire through it. A free discharge of clear fluid followed, and continued for some hours. The sac was not fully emptied next day. He complained of great pain in the groin and abdomen. I withdrew the thread. On the 23rd I tapped the sac, and let out 9 ounces of turbid fluid. He was discharged on the 27th. The left testis was rather larger than natural. The right seemed to be healthy. There was no fluid in the tunica vaginalis on either side. In October 1878 I heard through Mr. Drinkwater of Bicester that there had not been any return of the complaint. Hydrocele. Seton—Suppuration—Return on the other side. A lad, 19 years of age, a carpenter, of rheumatic constitu- tion, was admitted into the Radcliffe Infirmary, 22 February, 1865, under my care, with Hydrocele of the right testis. It had been tapped 5 months ago by Dr. Daly of Kingston Bagpuize. On the 27th I passed a needle with a double thread through the sac. Severe inflammation followed. Pus was afterwards discharged through the punctures made by the needle. He was discharged on the 5th of April. In September 1866 he come to me with a Hydrocele on the other side. I tapped it and let out about 8 ounces of clear fluid. The right side was well. On the 22nd of June 1878 I saw him. There was some fluid in the tunica vaginalis of the left testis. The right testis remained free from disease. He had not received any treatment for the complaint since he had been first under my care.

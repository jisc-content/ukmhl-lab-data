3«« body of a Patient in case of an Inquest, whether they are fit to do so in any case. The question is of importance to the Managers and the Medical Officers of all Public Institutions. For, if Mr. R. is right, his rule ought to be followed in all Hospitals and Workhouses ; and I, — as Coroner of the City, — must act upon it at the Radclifife Infirmary, and send a Practitioner from outside into the House on every Inquest. 16 Jime, 1880. To Dr. W. My dear Sir,—You know I believe, that I have been in communication with Mr. D., with reference to the late Inquest at the Asylum. The act of the Coroner, as I understand it, conveys such an imputation upon the Medical Superintendant, as well as on the Consulting Officers, that I (as a Governor), can not allow the subject to pass without calling further attention to it. If you, and the Consulting Officers, are not fit to examine the body of a Patient in case of an Inquest, it seems to me that you, and they, are not fit to do it in any case; and if so, that you and they ought not to be trusted to attend the Patients during life. I understand that the Coroner gave as a reason, that he wished to have some Practitioner independent of the House. Unless some one made oath before him that he believed the death was caused by negligent or improper treatment, the Coroner is required to take as a Witness the Practitioner in attendance. If Mr. D. is not able to be at the Committee on Tuesday, I propose to attend; and to beg their attention to the subject, and to suggest that they should refer it to the Commissioners in Lunacy. The question, as you can easily see, is of im- portance to the Governors and the Medical Officers of every Public Institution in the Kingdom, — not less than to all Practitioners. For if, — contrary to my opinion, — Mr. R. is right, it will be my duty, as Coroner of the City, to follow his rule in future cases, in Public Institutions, and in cases under private Practitioners. 19 June, 1880.

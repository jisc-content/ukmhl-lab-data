398 essential to their success, — if they put it off till after they have spent one or more Sessions in a Medical School. The Hospital with which I am connected as Surgeon con- tains about 150 beds in constant use. The cases of disease or accident are much the same as in other Hospitals in towns of the same size in an agricultural county, with several smaller towns and large villages within a convenient distance, and being the centre of several lines of Railway. The building is at present being enlarged, so as to give a new ward for accidents, and rooms for Out-Patients, with Apothecary's shop and other accommodation. The Pathological Museum forms a part of the University Collections^ under one roof, about half a mile from the Hospital. The Pupils have been almost always trained to act as Dressers, under the instruction of the Surgeon who introduces them. But I am not inclined to recommend to the Council of the College that such Dressing, — however valuable as a part of the practical training and instruction necessary for a Pupil, — should supersede the dress- ing required of Candidates for the Fellowship of the College. 14 Augtist, 1862. To THE Editor of the Medical Times and Gazette. Sir,—'By the present rules and regulations,'—as you remind your readers, —' all Students are required to attend certain classes.' There are very few Members of the College now living who began their education and passed their exami- nation before the time when the attendance was required on certain classes and lectures, and practise at a Hospital. Why should it still be required ? The College of Surgeons is an Examining Board, rather than an Academical body; and it ought to be sufficient, in a candidate presenting himself at the College for examination, that he brings to the Court of Examiners the required amount of Professional knowlege and Surgical handicraft, without reference to the sources from which he derives it.

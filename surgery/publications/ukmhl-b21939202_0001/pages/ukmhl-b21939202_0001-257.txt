245 if attention was given to the observance of the existing Rules, rather than to futile attempts at new restrictions or evasions. January 1871. > Report. Application, has been made to the Weekly Board to acknowlege the right of Ladies subscribing as Governors to attend the Weekly Meetings, and to take part with other Governors in the general business of the House. The and Rule (1848), in defining the qualification of Go- vernors, declares that ' Benefactors of 40 guineas' shall be ' Governors during Life,' and that ' Subscribers of 3 guineas a- year' shall be ' Governors during payment.' It is contended that as there is not in this Rule any limitation of the right of Governorship to gentlemen, ladies who have qualified them- selves by Benefactions or Annual Subscriptions are necessarily Governors within the meaning of the Rule, and—as such,— are entitled to all privileges of Governors, especially that of attending and acting at all Meetings. The Committee appointed by the Weekly Board to enquire into the subject believe, from the result of the enquiry they have made, that ladies have never been admitted to attend and act at any of the Meetings. Their attention has been directed to the 7th Rule, which defines the constitution of the Weekly Board, or Committee of Management. They are of opinion that this Rule positively excludes Ladies from the Weekly Meetings, and that the last clause of the Rule, in reserving to other Governors, not being members of the Committee, the former right to attend, expressly limits the right according to the custom which existed before the date of the Rule. The Committee are of opinion that the whole tenor of the existing Rules is inconsistent with this newly suggested inter- pretation. The Committee are of opinion that Ladies subscribing as Governors have no rights or privileges, except recommending Patients, and voting by proxy at Elections and Special General Courts. January 1864.

The plan proposed by Mr. Davy in the British Medical Journal, for cleaning catheters by drawing a bristle through them, has much to recommend it. But it is an objection to such a plan that it is not applicable to the catheters usually made, with openings or ' eyes' at the side, at a distance from the point. For many years I have found that I could clean catheters sufficiently by using the common wire stilet, having the end twisted into a small eye, through which a thread is passed, or a piece of string, according to the size of the catheter. The wire should be long enough to reach to the tip of the catheter. By moving this backwards and forwards as a piston, in a basin of warm water, the remains of the urine or other matters within the tube are effectually pumped out through the eyes at the side. About 35 years ago, I had a set of catheters made, with the wire stilet for each one having an eye at the point. With these, the catheters can be cleaned without much trouble. In some cases of retention of urine, I have found this kind of piston, or pumping action, useful in withdrawing the contents of the bladder when distended with blood, or in clearing the catheter when the tube is plugged by a clot. {British Medical Journal, March 1878.] Obstruction in the Urethra, a piece of bone impacted, after injury of the Pelvis.

340 respectfully to request the attention of the Committee to the contents of that letter. 26 February, 1868. To THE Chairman and Committee of Management. Gentlemen,— In acknowleging the receit of the Chair- man's letter of the 18th inst., informing me that the Committee must decline to reopen the question to which my letter of the 26th of February refers, I venture to submit these few remarks in reply. Considering that the Committee have impugned my Pro- fessional character and conduct, I must most respectfully ask of them that I may be allowed to have a full knowlege of their proceedings in the investigation which is stated to have been made ; and that I may be furnished with a copy of the Minutes, or other evidence, on which they founded the opinion they have recorded. The interests of the Infirmary, and of the. poor Patients of the House, — even more than justice to myself, — require that there should be a full investi- gation of the .charge made, namely, the breach of an important Rule of the House ; and if the Committee still decline the in- vestigation, and refuse the redress I seek with submission at their hands, I have no other course but to bring the whole subject fully before the Governors, and, if requisite, before the Public generally. It is for the Committee to consider whether the reputation of the Infirmary as an Institution for the treatment of the Sick Poor may not be damaged by the scandal to arise from the greater publicity of the facts. 31 March, 1868. From the Secretary, I received a copy of this Minute; — I April, 1868 :— * A letter having been received from Mr. Hussey, addressed to the Committee, the Secretary is desired to inform him that they have nothing to add to their communication of the i8th of March.'

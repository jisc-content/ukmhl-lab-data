404 To THE Editor of the Medical Times and Gazette. Sir, — In the Minute of the Council of the College of Physicians of Edinburgh, lately published^ are two passages which need a little more explanation. 'The Council [the Minute says] can not be surprized that the power of conferring the title of "Doctor," should be claimed as an exclusive right by the Universities.' The Council perhaps are not aware that the governing bodies of the Universities in England have never put forward such a claim. It is well known in England that the Archbishop of Canterbury has the right of conferring degrees as well in Physic, as in Divinity, in Arts, in Laws, and in Music; and the right is frequently exercised in all the faculties. The Council also state that the diploma of the English College of Surgeons ' implies legally only a right to perform operations, and attend cases of pure Surgery.' The Members of the College will not, I think, acknowlege this to be the only privilege conferred with the diploma. There are, I believe^ very few diseases which are not legally within the province of the Members of the College of Surgeons. A long list may be drawn by perusal of the earlier Statutes of the Realm; among them are intermittent fever, and all contagious diseases; and the Members of the College have always legally had the power of dispensing drugs for the treatment of such diseases. August 1859. To Dr. Wyllie.

I trust it will be suf- ficient that I address this to you, the Secretary of the College, as I conclude you are sufficiently in communication with Dr. C. to be able to make him acquainted with the contents without trouble to yourself. You are aware that I am a Member of the College, and

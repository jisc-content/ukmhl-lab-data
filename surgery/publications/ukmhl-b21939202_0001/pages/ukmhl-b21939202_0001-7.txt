TO THE DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH, K.G., Lord Lieutenant of the County of Oxford, President of the Radcliffe Infirmary. My Lord Duke,— To you, from whom I received the only honor that has come to me unsought, I venture to offer this collection of papers, — some Professional, some of a nature bordering on it. Many of them have been at different times submitted to criticism in the Professional Journals. Of the papers concerning the affairs of the Radcliffe Infirmary, many have been, at one time or other, in the hands of the Governors. None, I trust, are unworthy the attention of the President, — none unbecoming the position of an Officer. Of the large number of persons who were Governors of the Infirmary at the time, — now, more than thirty years ago, — that I was elected Surgeon to the Institution^ very few beside your Grace are now on the List of Subscribers. But, there are some still among them able to judge how far faithfully the duties I undertook were discharged, and able also to form an opinion whether the promise I then gave has been kept, — that they should never have cause to regret on the part of the Institution the appointment they then made. There are none among the supporters of the Institution whose approval I shall value more than your own. I have the honor to be. My Lord Duke, Your obliged and faithful Servant, E. L. HUSSEY.

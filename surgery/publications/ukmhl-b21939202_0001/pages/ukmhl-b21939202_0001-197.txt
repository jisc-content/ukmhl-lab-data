185 rubbish of a house which was being pulled down, and con- tinued to do so, though warned to keep away from the danger. There was a transverse wound of the scalp an inch and a half long across the frontal bone, where it is thinly covered with hair, about an inch from the margin of the forehead. The outer plate of the bone was broken, but without being much depressed. The injury was attended with slight symptoms of concussion. She rallied soon after admission.

I have since been informed by her daughter that she continued in good health for some years afterwards, and that she died in August 1878, having reached the age of 90 years.

In the course of the treat- ment I did not find it necessary to prescribe more animal food than is provided for the Patients in the ordinary diet of the Infirmary; nor in private practise did I see reason to advise any alteration of the usual meals, or to give any

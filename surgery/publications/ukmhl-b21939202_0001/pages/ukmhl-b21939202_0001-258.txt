246 To Dr. a. My dear a,—Thanks for your printed letter (dated 20 January,) which, with Mr. Treasurer's of December last, has reached me this afternoon. The subject being, as I conclude, in the hands of a General Court, it would not probably be thought becoming in me to give an opinion till I am asked for it. As matters of fact, you will, I doubt not, let me remind you of two things not quite clearly stated in your letter. The ' present Matron' was, I think, elected about 6 months before I was elected Surgeon. Were the ' considerable improve- ments' made in that short period so extensive and final that neither I, nor Mr. Vincent ' remain of those who took active part in those changes' to which you refer ? Surely the subscription for a ' Convalescent Hospital' began with the fund which Mr. Dodd and Mr. Rigaud took so active a part in raising — rather than that offered for the improvement of the New Building, — the old ' Fever Ward,' I mean. 17 February, 1868. To THE Rev. J. S. My dear Sir, — Thinks for your letter, and for the copy enclosed. The part of it to which you refer me having been considered at the Board, and, they having acted, there can not be any need of my giving an ' official' answer. The more so, as the matter is not one on which I care to trouble them. I July, 1868. To THE Same. My dear Sir,—I should have thought that when I said I remembered nothing about the matter in question, you would hardly have expected an official answer. However, there shall be one to that effect addressed to the Chairman on Wednesday. Discussion will be ' reopening a question the Committee have dealt with.' 3 July, 1868.

331 judge, though you have told me nothing but that you have passed a probe and felt some rough bone. Considering that it is not the general custom in Hospitals to amputate when any of the Staff gives his opinion that the disease will get well, and that the boy (W., I think,) on whose case I gave you such an opinion, died after operation, I venture to suggest to you whether it would not be well to communicate to the Child and Parents, or to the Recom- mending Governor, that the operation is not advised by the Staff unanimotisly. 19 May, i860. , From Him. Mayi\, i860. My dear Sir,—I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your note, and to state that I see no reason to alter my opinion. Yours faithfully, F. S. Ed. L. Hussey, Esq. To F. S., Esq. Sir, — By a letter received from the House-Surgeon this morning after 10 o'clock, I learn for the first time that the girl v., is to have her thigh amputated at 13 o'clock to-day. This is, as you know, against the Rules, — as there has not been a Consultation : and no doubt this, with other cases, will come before the Governors on Wednesday. My opinion, — which might, perhaps, be modified on Con- sultation, — is that the operation is as unjustifiable in her case as in the boy, W.j and the man (I forget his name), with fractured base of the skull. 21 July, 1862. ... I did not receive any answer to this letter. At the Quarterly General Court of Governors, 33 July, 1862, the Court ' ventured to express its hope that such arrangements might in future be made as to secure the ob- servance of the Rule in reference to Consultations before operations.'

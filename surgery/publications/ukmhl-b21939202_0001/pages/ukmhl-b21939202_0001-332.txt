320 9 March, 1875. to be a part of his work, — to report the cases to me, to receive my directions and see them executed, and to keep the instruments belonging to the House clean and in order, always fit for use. 2 December, 1873. To THE Rev. J. S. My dear Sir, — Your letter seemed so little of an official communication that I went this morning to see what Minute was made at the Board. Of course I see that it is not in any way an answer to my letter. It seems too much like a reso- lution not to entertain the subject at all:— ' That the Chairman be requested to thank Mr. Hussey for his letter, and inform him that the arrangement they have made with the House- Surgeon to attend to Physicians' Out-Patients is only of a temporary nature.' The contrast is remarkable. The Senior Physician makes a request — to be relieved altogether from care of Out- Patients : his letter is referred to the other Medical Officers, and — we know what followed. The Senior Surgeon makes a request, (for that small amount of Professional assistance which is given to all the Surgeons in every other Hospital in England,) his letter is read, and — we see what is not done. 19 December, 1873. To THE Chairman and Members of the Committee OF Management. Gentlemen, — I take the liberty of calling your attention to my letter of the 2nd of December. I am not aware that the question in my letter has received the attention of the Committee. 20 January, 1874. To the Same. Gentlemen, — Referring again to my letter of the 2nd of December, 1873, ^'"d recorded in the Minutes of the 10th, I beg the favor of your attention to the subject.

But I do wish to call attention to the death- dealing nature of the instrument by which the vapor is given. It is impossible to resist the conclusion that in many of the unfortunate cases which have been under public notice the Patient lost his life through carelessness : that, in fact, he was smothered with the apparatus in which the anesthetic was given.

The symptoms which precede the stoppage of the pulse and the breathing are not always reported completely ; perhaps they are not always observed. Artificial respiration fails to restore life. There are many inhalers well known, and occasionally in use, which are free from such a fatal objection. It is unjus-

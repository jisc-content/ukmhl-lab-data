341 To THE Rev. J. S. My dear SiRj—Thanks for your letter ; and for the trouble you take in this, as in all other matters about the Infirmary. I must altogether disclaim your reasoning that the respon- sibility of the scandal from publicity will be mine. It is with those who brought the subject before the Quarterly Court, and those who, having entertained it, make imperfect investi- gation and resist enquiry. The case is this. I have repeatedly called attention to the Rules we Officers have to obey. After the last note in reply, I sought the opinion of my Colleagues and Professional brethren. One of my Colleagues, disclaiming this appeal, applies to the Quarterly Court. Reference is made to the Committee, — a newly created Board. Of their proceedings you know more than I do. The attempt to make out of it a personal matter between two of the Officers is an evasion of the point,—which is simply a question of the ob- servance of Rules. 7 Ai)nl, 1868. To THE Same. My dear Sir,—There shall be an official letter from me to 'the Chairman,' requesting a place in the paper of business. You can hardly suppose that an Officer of a Public Insti- tution, who is conscious of having done his work with strict- ness, will submit to the charge, — made without notice, and recorded without asking for explanation. It is not the business of the Committee to enquire into the conduct of the Medical Officers ; and for that reason I did not refer to them. You can not have forgotten that when the Rules wei^e finally revised, I foretold that they would not be obeyed ;—and that you replied, ' We'll see that they shall be in future.' You know how often I have called yotir attention to the breach of thern., I sought Professional opinion on a Professional matter. I believe matters had become of public notoriety long before I printed the paper on which action has now been taken. c) April, 1868.

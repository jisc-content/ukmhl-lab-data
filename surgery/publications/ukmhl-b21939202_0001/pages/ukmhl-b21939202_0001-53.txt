41 was SLififering under an attack of scarlatina anginosa. On Saturday afternoon (the 15th) the child was in the mother's lap, when a large abscess in the left orbit burst through the upper eyelid. On Monday morning, about a o'clock, he was restless and was taken out of bed by the mother. While he was in the mother's arms, leaning with his head against her shoulder, a sudden and profuse rush of blood burst from the opening, flowing over the mother's shoulder. Mr. Druce saw the child soon after 6 o'clock. The bleeding had ceased before he arrived. He estimated the loss of blood at a pint. He applied a compress of lint, and a roller round the head. After Mr. Druce's visit, the child tore off the bandage and compress. They were replaced by the mother without further hemorrhage. I saw the child with Mr. Druce about 12 o'clock.

Upon enquiry, I learned that the bleeding had come on, as before, while the boy was out of bed, standing up for the dress- ings to be changed. I told her to go home and lay the boy down in bed, and that the bleeding would stop. When she found that I would not go with her, she tossed up her head

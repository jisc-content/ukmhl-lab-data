299 been (till very lately) actually ' refused,' I have on more than one occasion found such appearance of unwillingness on the part of a Weekly Board to grant an application, that I have often preferred to furnish from my own resources what I wanted, rather than make an application which might not receive a hearty assent from the Governors; — and that other things, for which application has been made, — though not strictly to be called Surgical Instruments, — have been refused. Nor is there much encouragement for the Surgeons to make an application. The Court may perhaps call to mind that on a former occasion, when the Surgeons addressed the Quarterly General Court, (in July 1856,) on the important subject of the Drugs, the Court did not acknowlege the letter, and excluded all mention of it from the Minutes. If the Court is of opinion that there should only be such a supply of instruments and apparatus as depends on a vote of a Weekly Board, I will readily continue to supply from my own resources the additional instruments I think necessary in the treatment of the Patients under my care. But if the Court is of opinion that it is the wish of the Governors that the Patients should have the benefit of all such new and improved instruments and mechanical appliances as the Surgeons think necessary, I beg respectfully to suggest that the Court should empower the Surgeons individually to order such as they think necessary, — in the same way as they are now enabled (by Resolution of the Quarterly General Court of October last) to order Drugs. The Court will bear in mind that the Surgeons are no longer paid, as formerly, for their services; and although it may seem a heavy or unjust tax upon them to furnish instruments, it will in general be less troublesome to use their own, than to find that those belonging to the House, (if wanted, and if applicable to the case in hand,) are not in proper order, (fit for immediate use,) or are in use out of the House.

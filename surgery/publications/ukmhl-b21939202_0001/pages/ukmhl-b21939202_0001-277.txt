265 glass chimney. Theoretically this is of course unobjectionable : prac- tically its value is shown by its being very rarely used. Its objections are, enormous expense to set up, great attention and care to be kept in order, and considerable expense and trouble in repairing the damage to which the glasses are necessarily subject. 17 November^ 1851. At the Quarterly Court in October 1855, I proposed — That it should be made a Rule of the House, that some of the wards should be painted and white-washed every year; in order that all of them in turn might be thoroughly cleansed, once in every five years at least. The question was referred to the consideration of the next Quarterly Court: and it was then carried, —by the casting vote of the Chairman. To A Member of the Committee. Given,—That the windows reach to the ceiling, or to the cornice, and that they are at such a height from the floor that the Patients can not see out of them as they lie in bed;—- That there is a fan-light over the door, reaching to the ceiling, and turning on a perpendicular pivot, so as to form a brat- tice;—That the throat of the chimney (of both chimnies, if two fireplaces, as I hope), is as high as the head of a person sitting in a chair;—That the bedsteads, even in the closest part of the ward, are so far from each other, that the Porters can bring the stretcher with a Patient on it to each side of every bedstead without moving any,—the 'cubic space' allowed to each bed, and the ' number of beds' in the ward, may, as far as my- wish goes, be left to Mr. Architect. The door should allow of a bedstead with a Patient being carried through it; and, what is more necessary, it should allow the Porters to bring the stretcher into the ward without check. Will you allow me to suggest also that the floor should be deal, not oak; and that the walls should be of plaster, to be painted. Of course the cupboards will be in the lobby,—not in the ward. 18 November, 1861.

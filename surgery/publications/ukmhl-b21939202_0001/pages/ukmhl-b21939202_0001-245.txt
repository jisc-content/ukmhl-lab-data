233 To TPiE Same. Sir. — It is not necessary to look beyond your pages this week to see what happens in a Hospital where some one or other of the Officers can curry favor, so to speak, with the Governors at the expense of his colleagues or Professional brethren. It is the same in all of them. Some 40 years ago,—before I ever thought of holding office myself in a Hospital or School,—I was requested by : some members of Committee at one of our County Hospitals : to call on a gentleman of property residing in the neighbor- ] hood, and to use whatever influence I had with him to increase i his subscription, at least to make it equal to that of other ; persons in his position. He was a friend of my father's ; and I he heard me with courtesy, pleading for a charitable Institu- I tion which I thought deserved his support. But he, civilly I enough, refused what I asked. He had lived much in the • world, and had resided in different parts of England, with . opportunities of seeing how Hospitals were often managed. He told me that he did not think the Hospitals did all the good t they were supposed to do, and especially he thought they did not do good to the members of the Medical Profession. ' Will your experience allow you to say that his opinion was ' wrong.? The Hospitals to which a School is attached may form an '. exception. There the Medical Officers have a bond of union ! in their common interest in the School, and the rivalry of e conflicting Practitioners does not become inconvenient; the ' Committee-room is not allowed to be the arena for their ■ jealousies.

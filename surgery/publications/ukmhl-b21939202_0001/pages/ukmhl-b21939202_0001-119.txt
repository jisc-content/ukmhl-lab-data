A boy, 9 years old, was brought to the Radcliffe Infirmary, 20 June, 1855, to be treated as an Out-patient, for Strumous Ophthalmia, from which he had been suffering since the last autumn. In answer to general questions about his health, his Mother mentioned occasional pain or difficulty in passing urine. Farther enquiry left little room to doubt that he had a stone in his bladder. He had passed blood with his urine at times, especially after taking exercise. He was often seen to be pulling the prepuce, or pinching the penis. These symptoms had existed several months, without advice being sought. He was therefore admitted an In-patient. The calculus having been felt by sounding, the lateral operation for Lithotomy was performed on the 30th of July ; and a flat oval calculus, composed of lithic acid, was extracted, weighing 44 grains. In the evening of the ist of August, some urine passed freely by the urethra ; and in the night, that which passed by the urethra, and that which flowed by the wound, was, much stained with blood. The opening in the bladder was probably healed by the 5th ; for after that day it was doubtful whether any urine could be detected in the discharge from the wound. On the 7th, after a dose of Castor oil, the bowels were freely open,—the first time since the operation. The wound in the skin healed slowly. For this reason, and because of the disease in his eyes, he was not discharged till the 5th of September. With the exception of a return of the ophthalmia in the winter, he has continued in good health. A boy, 8 years old, of strumous, but not otherwise unhealthy aspect, of irritable temperament, was sent to me by a Medical

171 the absence of the proof which might, perhaps, have been obtained by a careful examination of the contents of the pelvis, the correctness of the diagnosis must rest mainly on the opinion held by Dr. Hue and Dr. Rigby, both of whom considered, throughout their attendance on the Patient, that it was the ovary which was the subject of morbid enlarge- ment. \Medical Times and Gazette, February 1863.] Secondary Amputation of the Leg. On Friday, i December, 1854, a miller, 32 years of age, was in the upper part of his mill, ' putting on more power' to the machinery. While so employed, one of the stones flew in pieces; and a large piece struck him in the middle of the right leg. On recovering from the effects of the blow, he managed to get down a ladder, to walk to his house, about 20 yards distant, and then to get up a flight of stairs to his bedroom. Although there was a large wound in the leg, with muscle and bone protruding, no Medical assistance was sought till Sunday. The Patient lay in bed, with the limb on a pillow. There was some oozing of blood, but not loss enough to alarm him or his family. On Sunday night, December 3, I saw him, in consultation with Mr. Mallam of Hook Norton and Mr. Pritchard of Sib- ford. Both bones of the leg were fractured and comminuted in the middle third, with extensive laceration of the integu- ment and muscle. The extremity of the fibula, with much of the muscular, substance, was protruding. There was an offensive watery discharge from the wounds. The pulse was quick and weak, and the skin hot. The Patient's consent was readily obtained to the ampu- tation proposed. He was put under chloroform, and the leg was amputated below the knee, â€” about 55 hours after the accident. The Patient recovered favorably. He is now living and in good health.

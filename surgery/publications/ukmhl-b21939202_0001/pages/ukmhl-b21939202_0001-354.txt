342 To THE Chairman of the Committee of Management. Sir, — The Committee to-day will, I believe, prepare the paper of business for the Quarterly Court for Wednesday next. I take the liberty of requesting that the subject men- tioned in my letters of the 26th of February, and the 31st of March, may be placed on the paper in due course for obtain- ing the attention of the Quarterly Court. The Committee are also in possession of a letter addressed by me to the Chairman of the Quarterly Court of the aand of January. These letters have not been before the Quarterly Court: and it is with respectful submission to the Committee, that I beg leave to express my wish that they should be laid before the Governors at the ensuing Quarterly Court. 15 April, 1868. To THE Chairman of the Quarterly Court of Governors. Sir, — Referring to the question of the observance of the Rules relating to the Consultations before Surgical opera- tions, and to my letters of 23 January to the Chairman of the Quarterly Court, and 26 February and 31 March to the Chairman of the Committee of Management, I beg leave most respectfully to submit for the consideration of the Court to-day, that, from the way in which the question was first brought forward, and afterwards dealt with by the Committee, the charge made has not been fairly met; and that the ques- tion is one which, in the interests of the Public and the poor Patients who are the objects of your bounty, is deserving of full and fair investigation and adjudication. 22 ApTil, 1868. The Chairman wrote to me in reply, from the Infirmary, that the letter ' was duly laid before the Court, and that no action was taken with reference to it.'

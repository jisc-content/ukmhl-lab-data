i68 kept in a constrained position ; but she did not complain of the pain caused by any of the steps of the operation. {British Medical Journal, January 1868.] Enlargement of Ovary. Absorption of Fluid— Return of Disease. A woman, aged 35 years, was admitted 14 December, 1846, into St. Bartholomew's Hospital, under the care of Dr. Hue, with encysted dropsy of the abdomen. From the account she gave, it had existed for about 5 years. She had been in the Hospital in December 1845, under the care of Dr. Roupell, with the same complaint; she had been tapped at that time, and Dr. Roupell's opinion was that she was the subject of ovarian disease. She was in a low and very weak state, with aphthae on the inside of the lips and cheeks; she complained of severe pain in the abdomen, — and she seemed to be sinking from ex- haustion. Nutritious diet was ordered, with wine ; and Opium was prescribed freely, to allay the pain. Under this treatment, with rest in bed, the swelling of the abdomen disappeared completely; no tumor of any kind could be detected in the abdomen or pelvis, by external ex- amination. She left the Hospital, in comparatively good health, i February, 1847. She was re-admitted 22 April following, with a return of the dropsy, and discharged 12 July. She was again admitted 14 August (under the care of Sir George Burrows, I think). After being tapped, she died, with symptoms of peritonitis, 28 November, 1847. The abdomen was examined by Dr. Ormerod and myself. The usual appearances of acute peritonitis were present. A single ovarian cyst, with thick walls, contained several ounces of purulent matter, with the mark of recent puncture through the walls of the abdomen.

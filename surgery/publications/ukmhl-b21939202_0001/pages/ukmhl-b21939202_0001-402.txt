390 Regulations, enforcing an increased attendance in London, had previously deprived these Hospitals of most of the Pupils who formerly resorted to them as Schools of Surgery, It is an indirect attempt to force again on the teachers of Surgery those Regulations which were rescinded in 1826, upon the universal condemnation of the Members of the College, The number of Pupils attending a County Hospital (except the few to which a School is attached,) is necessarily small; they are for the most part the private Pupils, either of the Surgeons of the Hospital, or of the other Practitioners in the town where the Hospital is situated. This limited number gives facilities for Clinical instruction, which are excluded in the crowded wards of the large Hospitals in London. It is not maintained that a Student can obtain a complete Profes- sional education in a County Hospital: but it is well known that a valuable amount of practical knowlege, with Clinical instruction, is given in a more effectual way than in any Hos- pital in London, to the mere walking Pupils ; and it is on account of this valuable instruction that attendance on County Hospitals has been hitherto acknowleged as a part of recog- nized Surgical education. The Physicians and Surgeons give as it is, with little or no remuneration, direct or indirect, a considerable portion of their time to their duties at the Hospitals ; and the Council ought not to ask them to bestow more of it, in the shape of these new formal lectures, on a labor for which they do not offer any commensurate advantage. If the Council mean to follow this regulation by shortening the time required of candidates for the membership for attend- ance in London, much of the grounds of complaint will be cleared away : but they do not give any assurance of such a beneficial line of conduct. 28 September, 1854.

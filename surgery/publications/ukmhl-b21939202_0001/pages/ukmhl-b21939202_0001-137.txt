125 free from color. I punctured it again in December 1867; and again, I think, in February 1869 ; also in July 1870 and in August 1871. The right testis continued free from disease. The Patient died suddenly in December 1872 with disease of the heart. Hydrocele. Seton —Slough of Scrotum—Return of Disease on the other side—Seton. A farmer's boy, 15 years of age, the son of parents both of rheumatic constitution, was admitted into the Radcliffe In- firmary, under my care, 14 October, 1857, with Hydrocele of the right testis. It had been punctured once, about 3 months ago ; the boy said that no fluid followed the puncture. The day after admission I passed a single thread through it. Next day the boy complained of sickness and head- ache. I withdrew the thread. The inflammation which followed was rather severe. A portion of the skin of the scrotum sloughed, and the boy was rather lowered in general power. He was discharged on the 25th of November. He had been detained in the house by some rheumatic affection of the left ankle. On the 19th of June 1858 he came to me with Hydrocele of the left testis. I tapped it, and let out 10 ounces of straw-colored fluid. He was readmitted an In-patient on the 4th of August following. On the loth I passed a needle with a single thread through it. Next day little or no fluid had escaped: the testis was much swelled. I withdrew the thread. 14.—I tapped the sac, and let out 10 ounces of fluid, rather turbid in appearance. 16.—The swelling of the testis is less, but the scrotum is much swelled and thickened. Some purulent discharge afterwards came from one of the punctures made by the needle; it seemed as if it came from the scrotum, not from the tunica vaginalis. September 15.—He was discharged. The swelling of the testis had not quite subsided ; there remained some fluid in the tunica vaginalis.

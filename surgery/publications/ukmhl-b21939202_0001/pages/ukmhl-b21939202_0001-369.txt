357 Judges in general,' I afterwards heard remarked at a Meeting of the Society of Coroners, 'know very little of Coroners' Law.' Before I retired, I received the comforting assurance that the Court gave me -credit for the performance of the operation ; but whether it was the operation really performed, and de- scribed by me, I was not told. 'Nobody knows,' said the Chief Baron Alexander,- ' how much energy it requires in a Judge to hold his tongue.'

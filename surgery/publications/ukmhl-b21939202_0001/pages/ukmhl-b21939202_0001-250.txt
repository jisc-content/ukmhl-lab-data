238 Supposing any Bill, containing regulations for the Medical Profession should be again brought into Parliament, — as has been the case in almost every Session for the last 14 years, — it is not to be expected that it should pass at an earlier period than August 1858. If such Bill should order the preparation of a General Pharmacopoeia for the United Kingdom, it is hardly to be expected that, with the many other new duties then thrown upon the Colleges, they would at once proceed to undertake that subject. The London Pharmacopoeia (1851) was, I believe, not less than 4 years under preparation before it was published : and it is not likely that a new Pharma- copoeia such as that contemplated, which must of necessity be the work of Members of the Colleges residing and practising in London, Edinburgh, and Dublin, will take less time. So that I would submit to the Board that they can not expect we should have such a work before the year 1863. If, after the publication, it is wished to print a Pharmacopoeia for the Infirmary, founded upon such new general Pharmacopoeia, the trouble of preparing it will be much lessened by the previous possession of printed copies of one already known and in use ; — which would also be a useful groundwork for a new one. In most Hospitals and Dispensaries many drugs and pre- parations are used which either are not contained in the London Pharmacopoeia, or are made after less costly formulae. The chief purpose of printing the Pharmacopoeia of such institutions is that the Medical Officers may know what preparations are kept in readiness, after what formulze they are made, and in what respect they differ from the London Pharmacopoeia, which is followed in private practise. If the Medical Officers are acquainted with these matters of detail, much of their time is saved, — as well as that of the Apo- thecary and Dispenser. The medicaments prescribed are dispensed without delay and without confusion^ and generally in a very short space of time; and the funds of the House are spared, by the Medical Oflficers prescribing the pre- parations kept by the House, which, — though less elegant as well as less costly, — are, or ought to be, equally efficient with those of the London Pharmacopoeia.

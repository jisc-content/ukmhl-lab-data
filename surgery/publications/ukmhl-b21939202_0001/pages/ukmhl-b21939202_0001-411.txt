399 To THE Same. Sir, — In last week's issue you have laid before your readers the endowments — almost the only endowments in England, for education in Medicine at Oxford. You have not told them the duties attached, though you add that no instruction is given. It may perhaps add to the astonishment you attribute to many Medical men, to learn that, under the scheme laid down by the Founder, the Professor of Clinical Medicine is to visit the Patients in the wards of the Radcliffe Infirmary, with the Pupils, daily from October to March, and that he is also to read a Lecture two days in the week. In addition to the emoluments you have named, there is an old bequest producing about ;^8o a year, divided equally among the Physicians of the Infirmary, — formerly six, now three, in number. The Clinical Professor, as one of them, takes his third, in addition to the emoluments of two well- endowed Chairs. Novetnber 1878. To THE Same. Sir, — Your comments direct attention to the late Harveiaii Oration. Your readers will observe that the Orator, while praising what the University of Oxford has done for ' teaching Physical and Biological science,' evades the question of what is done for the Professional education of the younger members who are intended for the Medical Profession. The charge against the University and the Professors whom they take for their advisers, is that endowments which were given for the education of Students seeking to qualify them- selves for the Profession of Medicine are diverted into an other channel, — no doubt they think it a better one, — that of the ' Scientific education ' of gentlemen ; and that candidates for degrees in the Faculty of Medicine are sent to other places to get their knowlege of the practise of Medicine, and to prepare themselves for the examinations required by the University for the degrees they grant. August 9,1880.

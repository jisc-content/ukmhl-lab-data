334 the case of S.; and I know not whether it is his case, or the young woman^s (B.) I lately saw in Lichfield. In conformity with the Rule which requires us to tell the Operating Surgeon our opinion before he operates, it is right I should tell you that, — if it is in either of these cases—I think the operation unjustifiable. I am confident that, if the same care to keep the limb at rest, which will be neces- sary after the operation, is given now, both Patients will recover with useful limbs. I beg to suggest for your consideration that it would be right that the Patient should be told of this opinion, or, — at all events, — that he [or she] should not be allowed to believe that such an operation is done with the approbation of all of the Surgeons consulted. You may remember that in the former case, when you did the operation, the boy died. 14 April, 1867. From Him. April 15,1867. Dear Sir. — I have received your letter of the 14th inst. E. HussEv, ESQ. ^y^"""^' ^- To F. S., Esq. Sir, — A Notice late last night from the House-Surgeon tells me that you are going to ' excise a knee-joint' to-morrow; it does not tell the name of the Patient. If it refers to the case of S., or B., I have nothing to add to what I wrote to you on the 14th of April of the unjustifiable nature of the operation, and the ease with which a cure can be obtained without it. If it refers to B. the operation is, as you and the House-Surgeon ought to know, against the orders of the House ; it not being a case of urgency, and the previous Con- sultation of all the Surgeons, prescribed by the printed Rules, not having been held. 19 May, 1867. From Him. May 20,1867. Dear Hussev, — I have received another of your letters, dated May 19. Yours faithfully, F. S. E. HussEY, Esq.

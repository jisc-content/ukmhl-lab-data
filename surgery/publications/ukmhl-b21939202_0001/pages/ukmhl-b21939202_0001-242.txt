230 stitutional treatment, without undergoing any operation. ' It is a question of a totally different kind,' he says. In a well-managed Hospital the extirpation of a large arti- culation, such as the knee, may be, — perhaps is, — less fatal as an operation, and less unsightly in the resulting deformity, than the older operation of amputation through the thigh. But a large number of the Members of the College believe that neither of these operations is justifiable (Surgically speak- ing,) when the Patient can obtain a more useful limb without undergoing either of these questionable remedies for his disease, that a small number only of the cases which come before a Surgeon can with justice be classed as ' incurable,' and that the true mode of making a comparison, — 'the true parallel, the true value of excision of the knee,'—does not consist in leaving out of the question the very large class of Patients who regain a useful limb without the help of eradicating treatment. July 1864. To THE Same. Sir, — Cases have been lately reported with the experience of different Practitioners in the use of bandages of India- rubber as the best means of making even pressure, or of giving continued support, in cases of old ulceration or chronic swelling of the legs. Mr. Callender has mentioned a case of swelling of the knee after rheumatism, with effusion into the joint, treated in the same way. Allow me to suggest to your readers the use of the material in the treatment of the swellings of the fingers, which are often tedious and painful, in persons of rheumatic or gouty constitution. For two or three years past I have used a piece of an India- rubber finger-stall in fissures and slight cuts of the fingers; and for la months or more I have used it in cases of thickening or deposit around the joints of the fingers after injury, with great relief to the Patient. It has seemed to me that the brown finger-stalls of pure rubber are better than the black or vulcanised.

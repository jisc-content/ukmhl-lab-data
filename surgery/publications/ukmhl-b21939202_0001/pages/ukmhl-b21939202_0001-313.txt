30I been £1,644, in 1850, and £i,Sg^ in i85i : the annual sub- scriptions were £1,561 in 1850, and £i,S6y in 1861. The proposal that sickness and inability to procure the re- quisite Medical attendance should be the real claims to admis- sion without the necessity for presenting a Governor's turn, has my hearty recommendation. Such has ever been the practise of the House in cases of recent Surgical accident, and in a Hospital so richly endowed, and with a steadily in- creasing capital, — there is no satisfactory reason for a different practise in other cases of sickness. Sickness too often comes unexpectedly, and, among the poor especially, without any sufficient provision to meet the attack. There is no reason to think that the Radcliffe Infirmary would be an exception to what experience has taught, — that no general Hospital has ever failed from want of means to maintain its existence, and even to extend the full measure of usefulness projected by its Founders. On the other hand, it may be reasonably hoped that, by giving freer admission to the poor in cases of real sickness, the friends of the Institution would be increased in number, and — indirectly perhaps, but not less surely,—large and increasing donations, or ' benefactions,' would accrue to the funds. It may, perhaps, be worthy of consideration whether the burdens on the finances as at present expended could not be lightened, — always a matter of importance in a voluntary charitable Institution, — by removing the Patients when re- covervig at an earlier period. If a House of Recovery could be established in some healthy spot, at a convenient distance from the town, many of the Patients might be sent there when the acute stages of disease are over, and at a time when a change is desirable from the wearisomeness and depression of a sick ward, where the presence of the convalescents interferes more or less with the discipHne of the House (an Institution, be it always remembered, meant expressly for the sick), as well as with the peace and quietude which are absolutely necessary for those who are suffering from acute disease. They would regain their health more rapidly and more thoroughly in the freer air of the country, and when removed from continued intercourse and companionship with those

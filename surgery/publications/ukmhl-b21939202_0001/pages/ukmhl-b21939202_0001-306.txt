294 the Summoning Officer by one of the Resident Officers of the Infirmary. This has long been the estabhshed practise. None was given in this case ; and I never knew, till I saw the news- paper last night, that the question of an Inquest had been before the Committee. If I had known of it, I should have felt it a duty to the Public to attend the Committee, and explain why I did not think an Inquest necessary. 27 October, 1877. To THE Same. My dear Sir, — There is not anything in the letter to which you refer, that I wish to alter. Do you mean to say that a single case makes what people call a custom ? you are reported to have said as much. The intention of the Amended Registration Act is that every death shall be accounted for. Where a Medical Prac- titioner is in attendance, he is now bound to certify the cause of it. In case of doubt or suspicion, the Registrar and the Coroner are in communication. Under the amended Law, it is more than ever desirable that the Coroner should be a man of Medical education. In the late case (N.'s,) the death was duly registered on a Certificate from a Medical Practitioner: no application was made for an Inquest. It must be a rare case where a Coroner would be justified in ordering an Inquest in such circumstances. In 1871 I called the attention of the Committee to the inhaler used. If the Committee had then referred the ques- tion to the Medical Officers, — as they have now done, — it would not have been necessary for me to call their attention to it again. ■20 November, 1877. To THE Governors of the Radcliffe Infirmary. Gentlemen, — The question which has been before you some months, — whether you should appoint one paid Auditor, instead of three without reward, as heretofore, — being settled, there will not, I hope, any longer be a difficulty in obtaining the services of Governors willing to undertake the office: under this hope I request to be released from it.

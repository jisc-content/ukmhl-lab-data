309 ^1,300 and ;^i,30o — the remains of the fund which had been collected on behalf of the sufferers in Lancashire, after all the demands on it had been satisfied, — was given to the Infirmary, and taken by the Governors, on those conditions. They had received the money, they had recorded the con- ditions on which they received it, and they had refused to comply with them. The Charity Commissioners had power to compell the performance of the conditions ; and he proposed to the Board that they should request them to do so. It had been suggested to him that, instead of submitting the question to this Board in the terms of the motion, it would be better to refer it to a Committee, such as the Nuisance Removal Committee. He preferred the terms of his own motion rather than a reference to a Committee ; as he thought it was important first of all to ascertain whether the Charity Commissioners would interfere, because if they would not, the Board would have to agree to any terms the Managers of the Infirmary should require. If there was any general feeling at the Board in favor of a Committee he did not wish to stand in the way of it. After discussion, Mr. Hussey said, in reply, that from the Minutes which had been read of the different Courts of Governors, it appeared that the agreement made in 1869, to which he had called attention, had not been acted upon. But as those Minutes clearly implied that Patients were to be admitted free, without tickets or turns of recommendation^ it seemed to him to be still more important to ask for the in- terference of the Charity Commissioners to see such arrange- ment carried out. There seemed to be a general wish to refer the subject to a Committee. He would, therefore, ask the Board to allow him to withdraw the motion he had proposed, and to propose instead, — 'That the question be referred to the Nuisance Removal Committee, with instructions to report to the Board.'

300 Dr, C. He refers, without questioning its correctness, to what has been repeatedly published during the last three or four years, that the finances are in a state of ' embarrassment.' The Annual Report for 1861, published by the Weekly Board, reports that 'the adverse balance of the previous year has been increased to £610, at the close of the last.' The report of the Committee appointed at the Quarterly Court in January, to consider the state of the Finances, received at the last Quarterly Court, and published in your paper of the 26th of April (of which it is remarkable that, while it treats of the expenditure in detail, it is silent on the subject of the receits), states that ' the Committee find that the balance against the House at the end of 1861 was £612;'' and the Committee recommend, ' on financial grounds,' that there should be a reduction in the number of beds now in the House. It appears from information given by the Treasurer, in answer to a ques- tion at the last Quarterly Court, that, fi'om this adverse balance of ;^6i2, is excluded a sum of uninvested life subscriptions, amounting to about ;^335, in hand at the end of the year. When a proposal is publicly made, and supported by the Treasurer and other active Governors, that some of the warda should be closed from a supposed failure of funds,—and when the Treasurer opposes the admission of Ladies as visitors to the wards, because, as he says, it is a ' time of great financial difficulty,'—it seems to be within the duty of the Medical Officers to enquire publicly whether this pecuniary difficulty or ' embarrassment' really exists. To me it seems that the finances are in a thriving state, and that, for at least the last I a or 15 years, they have never been otherwise. From the Annual Reports it appears that in the last I3 years the sum of £S'^A'^9 has been contributed to the funds: the expenditure of the House during the time was £a6,']2()-, leaving a balance in favor of the House of ;^4,'58o, which, if every thing desired by the Officers for the treatment of the Patients had been furnished, might have been properly invested in stock. The sum actually applied to the purchase of stock was ^^5,364 —more by ;^684 than the excess of the receits over the expenditure. The annual income arising from in- vested capital appears, from the same printed reports, to have

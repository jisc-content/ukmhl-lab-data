226 in advising, — on account of the late cases of Small-pox ; ' our late epidemic,' he calls it: the latest 'panic' in fact. What a pity, before that expenditure was incurred, the opportunity offered was lost, of taking precautions against infection by the only disease which the science of Medicine has yet found the power of 'preventing'! Instead of doing so, measures, — in themselves useful and benevolent, — were directed to treat- ment aft-er infection. Thus ' those factors of the thing we call trouble got to the head they did do.' The principle had not been admitted, which experience has taught in some places, that, in the interest of the rate-payers, prevention is cheaper than treatment. The ' Reasons' may be worth investigation: they do not seem conclusive to, — Mr. Mayor, ONE OF THE RATEPAYERS. Deceinber 1871. To THE Revd. the Vice-Chancellor. Dear Sir, — If not an improper intrusion on my part, I beg the favor of your bringing before the Governing Body of the University a subject I had proposed to myself to bring in the first instance under the notice of the Local Board of Health,—the necessity of providing accommodation in cases of sickness for the younger Members of the University, especially in cases of infectious fevers and injuries from accidents. It has been suggested to me that, — although it might become the duty of the Local Board to provide a Hospital open to Members of the University, as to others, — it is not for that Board to entertain the question whether it is the duty of the University to make provision for the wants of their own Members in sickness or in health, or to admit any suggestion of the neglect of such a duty. It seems to be the more proper course to submit the question to yourself. It can hardly be necessary, I suppose, for me to repeat the opinion I expressed in 1871, at one of the first Meetings of the Local Board at which I was present, that few of the Colleges are in a state to meet the invasion of an epidemic.

219 However few the facts which are here brought together, yet being of local interest, they are perhaps of sufficient value to be recorded by this Society. At the late period of the epi- demic at which the attempt was made to collect them, it was not found practicable to obtain materials for a complete account of the. visitation. Such as they are, they have been put into their present shape in the hope that they will not be thought unworthy the attention of members of the Society. For various notes of cases furnished to Dr. Ogle or to myself, my thanks are due to my colleagues, the Physicians and Surgeons of the Radchffe Infirmary, Dr. Jackson, Dr. Acland, Mr. Hester, Mr. Hansard, and Mr. Symonds, to Mr. Briscoe (then House-Surgeon to the Infirmary), Mr. Coar, Dr. Freeborn, Dr. Giles, Mr. Godfrey, Dr. Leapingwell, Mr. Owen, Mr. Rusher, Mr. Taunton, Mr. Vincent, and Mr. Wood. . . . This Paper was read before the Ashmolean Society of Oxford; and though perhaps it may be thought too imper- fect for Professional Literature, it is the only record, as far as I know, which has been kept of the visitation.

About 5 weeks afterwards, the mother, who had a clear vaccine cicatrix on the arm, was attacked with Variola in a mild form. She continued to suckle the baby during the whole time. The

127 Hydrocele on both Sides, Left, seton—Return—Paracentesis . —Right, stationary. A laboring man, 53 years of age, of rheumatic constitution, was admitted 33 March, 1859, into the RadcHffe Infirmary, under my care, with Hydrocele of both testes. The tumor on the right side was not large, and he did not find any incon- venience from it. That on the left side had existed for 20 years. It had been tapped at Whitsuntide 1858, and again at Christmas. On the 28th of March I passed a single thread of iron wire through it. The fluid passed off by this. The thread came out on the 30th. No swelling of the testis followed, nor any symptom of inflammation. The man was discharged on the 6th of April, The swelling was tapped frequently in the years which followed, Dr, Denton of Steeple Claydon afterwards tapped it on the 8th of May 1876 ; he repeated the operation three times between that day and the T5th of April 1877, when the Patient died under an attack of hemiplegia. The water col- lected very rapidly, requiring for the man's comfort to be drawn off about every 3 or 4 months. Each time there was between a pint and a pint and a half of fluid of a pale straw color. There was some slight effusion on the right side, but it did not give the man any annoyance. He told Dr, Denton that it had never been tapped.

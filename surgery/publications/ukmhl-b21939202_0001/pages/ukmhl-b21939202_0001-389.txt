377 Quarterly Court in April last year, it was Resolved,—by the correction of what was then voted to be an ' error,'— that I had been, in January 1878, appointed an ' Honorary Surgeon' of the Infirmary, The privileges of such an Officer were, I believe, created under a letter from the late Clinical Professor in June last year, and they consist in the use of a Laboratory lately erected for Medical research. The only time I remember a question of the position of such an Officer coming before the Governors, was at the Quarterly Court in October i860j when, one of the Junior Physicians having accepted a Professorship, which was declared by the terms of the endowment to be incompatible with the practise of Medicine, resigned his office of Physician. Before that time the only ' Honorary' Medical Officers were the Senior Physician and the Senior Surgeon, upon ceasing from their active duties. I urged upon the attention of the Governors present that the proceedings in a Hospital should be brought under the influence of a legitimate public opinion, and that the work of the Medical Officers should be open,—as far as it could be made so,—to the review of their Professional brethren ;—that by continuing the retiring Physician upon the Medical Staff, he would have the right to be present, as formerly, upon occasions of Medical investigation, — and I proposed that he should be named an ' Honorary Physician': it was agreed by the Court, 23 March, 1880. To THE President and Governors of the Radcliffe Infirmary, My Lord Duke, and Gentlemen,—On the 20th of March, i88o, I was informed for the first time that,—by the correction of what the Quarterly Court of Governors in April 1879 voted to be 'a Clerical error in the Minutes/ — I had been, in January 1878, ' made an Honorary Surgeon' of the Infirmary. Whether this was the only 'error' in those extraordinary proceedings, you may be better able to judge, if you have before you the state of things in which — to use the words of the Report for the year 1878, — I ' ceased to be a Surgeon to the Infirmary.'

254 Remarks upon the Report of the Sub-Committee. In the Report of the Sub-Committee is the following ; sentence : —' The Patient appears to have complained several > times of her diet; and these complaints were duly reported to Mr. Hussey by the Nurse.'' The complaints, reported to me by the Nurse, were con- fined to a statement that the Patient did not like the diet prescribed, or did not take the whole of it. From the ' Evidence' taken by the Sub-Committee it appears that j the Patient never expressed a wish for any particular article ' of diet. It also appears from the ' Evidence' that she com- \ plained on several occasions to tke House-Surgeon. It seems I to me that it was a neglect of duty on his part that he never on any occasion reported any complaint to me. Mr. D.'s ' Conditional Report' gives a Medical opinion of his own on the case of a Patient whom he never saw. . . . It is in direct contradiction of the facts reported by the Sub-Committee, of which he was a Member. It is not sup- ported by the opinion of any one of the Members: and it was afterwards cancelled by a Resolution of the Quarterly Court. In the Nurse's 'Evidence,' — She never made any remark ' to me about a change of diet. She never expressed gratitude to anybody. In the Chaplain's, — The girl appeared to be very morose in her disposition. May, 1873. To the Rev. J. D. My dear Sir, — It may perhaps have escaped your memory that at the Quarterly Court in July, when I moved that your ' Conditional Statement' on the case of S. B. should be erased from the Minutes, you said that 'the Patients were made to suffer because t/iere was an ill-feeling between me and the House-Surgeon" I am not gtiite sure of the first words; but I am quite sure of those I have underlined, — that there was an ill-feeling between him and me. So far as my feeling toward him is concerned, there is not a particle of truth in the statement so made by you.

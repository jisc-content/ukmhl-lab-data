37 bed. The last ligature came away on the iith. She com- plained of uneasiness from constipation, and two pills of extract of colocynth were given to her. The bowels acted freely the next day (the I2th)—the first time since the operation. The remaining piece of sponge was removed on the 17th. She was discharged from the Infirmary on November ii, the wound having nearly healed. On December 20 I saw her. The cicatrix was firm and contracted ; the integument around it was puckered, thickened, and discolored. On April 27 following I saw her at her own home. A large ulcerated wound, with everted edges, occupied the site of the cicatrix, attended with profuse watery discharge, evidently of a cancerous nature. Her general strength failed rapidly, and she died 25 May 1858. Compound Fracture of Leg. Secondary Hemorrhage — Death from Exhaustion. A farm laborer, aged 32 years, rather given to drinking, and (as I learned after his death) subject to fits, was admitted into the Radcliffe Infirmary, under my care, 6th November, 1852, with a compound comminuted fracture of the bones of the right leg. Early in the morning, when under the influence of drink, he was riding on a heavily loaded waggon. In trying to get down, he fell; and one, or both, of the wheels went over the limb. The accident was not followed by any large amount of bleeding. The leg was put in splints without difficulty, in a good position. Both Tibial arteries could be felt at the ankle. Some days after admission, erysipelas appeared on the face and on the leg; and it spread upwards toward the nates. On the 18th free suppuration was established, and the erysi- pelas was subsiding favorably. In the night he was very restless. Toward morning he kicked the bed-clothes off. The Nurse thought he had a ' fit,' Some blood was observed upon the sheet under the splint, and some on the floor. It had ceased to flow when the House-Surgeon came to the ward. The man was evidently sinking. He died before noon.

This, I think, existed at the time of the first operation; and the circumstance partly explains the difficulty found in the attempt to evert the foot.

Upon recovering from an attack of Measles in childhood, a slight discharge was observed from the ear; and about the same time a small swelling was observed in front of the ear. This was considered to be a ' kernel,' or gland; and was not thought to be of much importance. The discharge from the ear has continued more or less ever since, — sometimes watery, sometimes purulent. At 13 years of age, when at play with

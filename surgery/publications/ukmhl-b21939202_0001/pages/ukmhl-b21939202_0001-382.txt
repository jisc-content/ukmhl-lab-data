370 It is remarkable that in the printed application to hold an Inquest, the operation, (the treatment^ in fact,) is placed among the alleged circumstances of death. Let me suggest that the form of notice should be reconsidered and altered. While I continued one of the acting Medical Officers, I had beforehand an outline of the Medical evidence. Through the courtesy of Mr. Briscoe, I have received such through him. It saves unnecessary questions, and enables me to shorten the examination of the witnesses who depose to Medical facts or opinions. Always bearing in mind that when first appointed Coroner, I received in the House the congratulations of Mr. S., no one reciprocates more heartily than I do, the wish for a peaceable and orderly observance of the proceedings in the discharge of the duties of the office. Immediately after the Meeting in January last year, when my connection with the House as one of the Medical Officers ceased, I went to the Senior Medical Officer, with whom I had acted as a Colleague for a8 years, and — in the hope of permanently establishing friendly relations, — I suggested that he should be the bearer of a communication from me to the Committee. He declined to do so. 22 Januaryy 1879. To THE Secretary, Radcliffe Infirmary. Dear Mr. Secretary,—Although in Mr. S.'s letter to the Secretary of State there is only one question raised, there are ' circumstances ' brought under his notice, to which my atten- tion is directed by your sending me a copy of the letter. I have not referred to these in my letter to you in reply. I beg the favor of your laying that letter of mine and this before the Governors at the next General Court. From the Minute of the Court, a copy of which was sent to me at the time, it appears that the reason given by the Governors for ' removing' me from the office I held was that they were of ' opinion that the offices of Surgeon to the Infirmary and Coroner to the City are not proper to be held

38 Several ounces of coagulated blood surrounded the broken pieces of bone, and passed deep among the muscles. The Posterior Tibial artery had given way by ulceration in two places, and the anterior in one place. The lower fragment of the shaft of the tibia was driven firmly into the medullary- cavity of the upper part, and the foot was thus held in a good relative position. Remarks.—At the time of admission both Tibial arteries were felt beating at the ankle. The coats of the vessels were not injured enough to hinder the free passage of the blood through them. The foot was in good position. In a man of the Patient's age there was good ground for hope of recovery. {Medical Times and Gazette, 15 March, 1879.] Hemorrhage from Abscesses. It is not often in the minor operations of surgery that a Practitioner sees much hemorrhage from a small wound, or a flow of blood which requires anything more than temporary pressure to restrain it. It has happened, however, to myself sometimes, as to others, to find it arise from a vessel in the common integument. In 1845, a young married woman, of strumous constitution, about 26 years of age, was admitted into St. Bartholomew's Hospital in a weak and sickly condition of general health. Her mother was one of the Sisters of the Hospital, and by her wish, privately expressed to the Matron, she was placed under the care of Dr. Hue, in a ward where I was acting as Clinical Clerk. Several small abscesses, arising from a cachectic dispo- sition— some of them superficial, and some deep — formed successively in different regions. In opening one of them, situated superficially at the inner side of the left arm, a little above the condyle, I observed a full stream of venous blood flowing from the puncture. Upon separating the edges, it appeared that the blood came from a slit in a large vein immediately under the skin. The side of the vein had been transfixed by the lancet as it passed into the sac of the abscess.

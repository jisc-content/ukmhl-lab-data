42 and went away. In January, 1862, I again saw the boy. The disease had ceased ; but the limb was shortened under the effects of the disease. Disease of Hip. Abscess—Hemorrhage—Death from Exhaustion. In October and November, 1866, a boy of weakly constitu- tion, 10 years old, was in the Radcliffe Infirmary, under my care, with disease of the hip-joint in an early stage. He was much relieved by rest, and was sent back to his friends. He was readmitted in September, 1868, with the disease much advanced and an abscess discharging freely.

The attendance of a neighboring Practitioner (Dr. Spencer) was obtained. From him I learned that the boy's strength failed rapidly after this, and that he died exhausted in the beginning of Februaiy, 1870. [Medical Tiines and Gazette, June, 1879.] Hemorrhage from the Gum, after Extraction OF A Tooth. In 1854 the late Mr. Andrews, (Dentist,) summoned me one day to his house to see a gentleman with bleeding from the gum, after extraction of one of the molar teeth in the lower jaw. I suggested that the tooth should be replaced at once,—accord- ing to the practise often adopted by Dentists with success. He told me that the tooth had been drawn two days before, and thrown away; that the Patient lived in the country, and

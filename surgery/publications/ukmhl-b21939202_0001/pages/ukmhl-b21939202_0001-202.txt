they brought her, or if I could have foreseen the rapid exhaustion which followed the operation, I would have ampu- tated the limb immediately on her admission: for in that state I should have had less fear of her sinking from ex- haustion, whatever other sources of danger might have been feared. The exhaustion, under which she sunk, seemed referable to her previous condition. The injury inflicted did not involve any vital part, and she had rallied from the first effects of it. The operation did not produce any ' shock,'' or any im- mediate appearance of depression: and the abstinence from food was not of suflficient length to shorten life. In a forensic enquiry it might be a matter of curious speculation whether the injury was a ' burn,' or a ' scald,' whether it was the eff"ect of fire or boiling water ; there is not any doubt that it was the effect of heat. The evidence given by the friends is of a scald, the appearance was that of a burn. No clew could be got from the Patient. The neigh- bors who saw her soon after the accident say that it was the consequence of overturning the kettle on the fire, and that her clothes were wet and were not burnt. To me it had the appearance of being the effect of fire; and as if the tightly drawn sleeve of her gown had saved the skin of the upper arm from some of the effects of the flame which had charred the shoulder and fore-arm. In that region only (on the inner aspect of the humerus), was there any resemblance to the more common appearances presented by the effects of boiling water. \The Asylum Journal, July 1855.] Compound Fracture of Fore-arm.

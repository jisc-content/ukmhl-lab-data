255 Before reporting your words to him, I am willing to receive from you any explanation, or any correction, if you think your memory on the subject is more correct than mine, 23 October, 1873. To THE HOUSE-SURGEON. Dear Mr. P., — Although I have httle doubt that you are well acquainted with the case which has been before the Committee, in one shape or other, for the last eight months or more, I think it right, (if it should be that you have not seen it,) to call your attention to a part of my second Report, made upon reading the Report of the Sub-Committee, in which your name was brought forward for the first time, in connection with the case. The Secretary can show it to you. I told the Committee that when a Patient in a Hospital makes a complaint, or a statement on the subject of his case, to the House-Surgeon, it is the duty of the House-Surgeon himself to report it to the Medical Officer who is responsible for the treatment: — and that the Medical Officers can not do their duty with credit to themselves and with satisfaction to the Governors, if this obvious duty is neglected. 27 October, 1873. — If Mr. D. believed that there was an ill-feeling, under which the work of the House suffered, in one of the Medical Officers toward the House-Surgeon, it was his duty to bring the subject to the notice of a General Court of Governors. If he believed that there was such a feeling in the House- Surgeon toward one of the Medical Officers, it was his duty to bring it to the notice of the Committee of Management, whose servant the House-Surgeon is. To THE Rev. R. E. C. Dear Sir,— In acknowlegement of your letter of the loth inst., I assume that the Committee, — composed of Governors of the Infirmary,—are sufficiently acquainted with the means of Medicai relief at the disposal of the Governjng Body, as well

194 Upon examination after death, it appeared that the coracoid process was broken completely off from the scapula. Two separate pieces were found, drawn apart by the muscular fibres attached to them,â€”one downwards on to the ribs, the other inwards toward the humerus, below the rent in the capsule. There was not time to allow of a careful dissec- tion, so as to see whether the muscular fibres attached to the fragments of bone were in truth, what I thought them to be, those of the pectoralis minor in one case, and the coraco- brachialis and biceps in the other. These two pieces of bone, when put together, do not form the complete process as it exists in the skeleton. A small piece of bone at the base and side is wanting. This escaped detection in the hasty examination, which was the only one I had the opportunity of making. [Medical Times and Gazette, January 1865.] Dislocation of the Patella. A lad, aged 17, was admitted into the Radcliffe Infirmary, 29 June, 1B58, with dislocation of the right patella outwards, from an injury received about an hour before admission. He was getting on a horse, when the horse slipped, and both of them fell, the man undermost, on his left side ; he received a severe blow on the knee as the horse fell upon him ; he says he was ' kicked on the knee' by the horse. When the horse jumped up the lad found himself unable to rise, that his right knee was immovably bent, and in great pain. He was brought at once to the Infirmary. The patella was driven off the outer condyle, and turned on its long axis, with its outer edge directly forwards, making a sharp projection under the skin; the inner edge, or rather its anterior surface, resting against the outer tuberosity of the femur. The bone was held firmly in its new position. The limb was slightly bent at the knee; the tendon of the rectus femoris muscle was tense at its attachment to the patella; the ligamentum patellae was flaccid. The Patient was laid on his left side, with the trunk bent

To THE Same, Sir,—In the last number of the Medical Times and Gazette, you refer to the recommendation made by the Jury at an Inquest on a prisoner at Clerkenwell, — that the examination of the bodies of prisoners should be made ' by an independent Medical man,' and that he should give the Medical evidence of the cause of death.

Moreover, it would be casting a slur upon the Medical Officer of the Prison, who is answerable to them for the discharge of his duties, and believed to be competent; for a Practitioner who is not trusted to examine the bodies of Patients under his care, and give evidence of the cause of death, will not be regarded by Magistrates or the pubHc as a fit person to be trusted to treat them in sickness during life.

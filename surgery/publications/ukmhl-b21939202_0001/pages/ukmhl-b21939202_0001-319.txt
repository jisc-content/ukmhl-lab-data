307 with 5 of the Officers, and a lady, — all that attended out of a list of 600 Subscribers. The Auditors reported that the expenses of the Quarter were £^,79^- They did not tell how much of the sum had been paid during the quarter, and how much remained waiting to be paid. The Treasurer did not tell the amount of cash in his hands. We are told much about the expenses of the House; we hear little of the large sums which are continually received by the charity. Surely it is the duty of the Treasurer of a Charitable Institution which solicits contributions by public subscription, to tell the assembled Governors, when he meets them, what balance of cash he has in his hands. 30 1878. To W. W. W., Esq. My dear Sir,—Your printed letter has reached me,— directed, as I think, in your own hand. Is it meant for a joke ? — an other attempt to practise on the credulity of the Gover- nors ? Have you forgotten that at the Quarterly Court in April last, I obtained from the Treasurer an acknowlegement that the outstanding bills were £1,0,00, and that the cash in his hands was 1,500.? You were sitting next to me, and I called your attention to it, — pointing out to you that this was the ' deficit,' about which there was so much talking, and writing, and printing. Do you think it likely that a proposal for increasing the pecuniary subscription from each Governor will be adopted, if the truth is made known about the balance of cash in hand ? It is left out of sight in your letter ; as it is in what comes from the Treasurer himself and his Committer. It is a large assumption you make in the last sentence of your letter, —' that no material reduction can be made in the expenditure without considerably interfering with the efficiency of, and the benefits arising from, the Infirmary.' I do not allow it. But I am of opinion that none will be made as long as Mr. S. has the management of the money. 30 Septetnber, 1878. X %

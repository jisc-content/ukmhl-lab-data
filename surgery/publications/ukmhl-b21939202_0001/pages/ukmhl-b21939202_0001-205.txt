193 and no weight fell upon him. The day after admission he had the right feeling in his hand, and was able to move the fingers freely; there was not any hemorrhage externally, nor more swelling than might be expected in a young and plethoric subject; nor, subsequently, was there any appear- ance of a 'bruise.' It did not seem to be an injury of a very serious nature, nor such as to forbid a confident hope of recovery in the usual period. He was supported with nourishing diet,â€”broth and strong beef tea. Ale was given, and afterwards port wine freely; latterly he had brandy, which he refused when offered to him at first. Though he seemed relieved for the time by the stimulants, the treatment had not any effect in checking the progress of the gangrene. When I saw the body, about 3 hours after death, the in- tegument felt hot to the hand, rather than warm ; and before permission could be obtained for an examination, decomposi- tion had gone so far that an examination could not be made. [Medical Times and Gazette, September 1858.] Dislocation of Humerus. Comminuted Fracture of Coracoid Process. A mason's laborer, aged 22, slipped his footing on a scaf- folding in the early daylight of a winter's morning, i December, 1864, and fell from a great height on his left side among a pile of loose bricks. He was picked up insensible, and taken at once to the Radcliffe Infirmary. Among other injuries of very severe character (from which he did not rally), his left humerus was dislocated inwards and forwards, the head of the bone being below the clavicle. The dislocation was reduced immediately without difficulty by the House-Surgeon (Mr. Winkfield). From the report of his fellow-workmen and the appearance of the body, it seemed that the man had fallen on his left side, with the elbow drawn back and the fore-arm flexed on the humerus ; the elbow receiving the shock of the weight of his body as he fell.

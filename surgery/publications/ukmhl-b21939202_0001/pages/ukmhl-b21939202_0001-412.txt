400 THE ELECTION AT THE COLLEGE OF SURGEONS. To THE Editor of the British Medical Journal. Sir, — We hear that the Fellows by examination are to squeeze out those who are not of our own selves. The mark '43 is a blot on a man's escutcheon ; though the putting him on the list of 1843 was a question in which few of those whose names are on it had a voice. Sir, in reviewing that list, or its successor of 1844, is no distinction to be made between those who at the time were qualified to be put on it, — to pass for it 'by examination,' — and those whose claim was their ' Seniority' as Members of the College, or of the human species at large ? If we had never supported any of these last when pro- posed as Candidates for seats in the Council, we might now, I think, with some show of consistency, claim the right to keep the seats for ourselves, and our successors under the ' Exami- nation ' test. We try the Candidates by various and varying tests, — more strictly perhaps as each year increases their number. But, Sir, I take the liberty of suggesting for the consideration oi all the Fellows of the College, that if a Candidate is otherwise qualified, the fact that the Council of a former day deprived him of the power of submitting to the examination, should not be thought a reason for passing him by in favor of one of his juniors, though equally qualified for the distinction. 22 June, 1867. To W. A., Esq. My dear Sir,—When I met you last week, and we talked of the coming Election, and the dislike I and others had of the canvassing, you asked, if you remember, whether it had occurred to me to put forward any statement of my views. I said it had not: and that there seemed to me a sufficient objection,— that I did not know what questions were likely to be brought forward.

272 would satisfy you and me, as long as the Patient remains in it. If you, or others, wish her retained there, experimeriti causd, it is not for me to object. A Governor, who is fully competent to form an opinion, said to me that the case was one which ought never to have been put into the ward. I do not see why we should wish to cast a slur on those who did it; and it is useless now to discuss it, Ubi lapsus, &c. On Saturday [night, I think,) I had, by Mr. E's letter, the first intimation of the subject.

I have seen Mr. Dry, the other Visitor; he does not act, as I understand. I have reason to-day to believe that Mr. E. is absent. What have you to suggest ? Tell me. This occurs to me, as an ultimatum. When I visit the Infirmary to-morrow, if the woman is still in the ward, and still fit to be moved, that I should take her myself over to the New Building; if the

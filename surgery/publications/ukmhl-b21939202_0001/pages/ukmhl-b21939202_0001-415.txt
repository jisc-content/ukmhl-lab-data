403 the last act of the Chairman's Hfe I have to give you a toast; it is, ' The Health of our Hon. Secretary, Mr. Allingham.' He is the Executive Officer of the Committee of Stewards, without whom (I hope I may say it without offence) they could not be brought together, to act, and to plan what is before us. I am one of those who remember the enthusiasm and high feeling with which this Festival was established. Is it not due to the Secretary that it is not likely to drop ? We ought not to part without this acknowlegement of his services, and without making the small return which our thanks can give for the work he has so kindly done for us. [The Medical Titnes and Gazette, 14 July, 1877.] To Dr. B. Sir,—Some of my Professional brethren in this City have called my attention to remarks made by you at the meeting of the Medical Association at Leeds, referring to the meeting last year in Oxford. ' Situated as Dr. A. was, with little assistance to prepare for such a great meeting as that of the Association was, and the extraordinary amount of labor which necessarily fell upon him in consequence of the deficiency of assistance, it was marvellous to him (Dr. B.), who knew something of the labor necessary to get up such a meeting, how Dr. A. succeeded in doing what he did.' The words, we consider, imply that we did not give Dr. A., when President, the assistance that ought to have been rendered. If Dr. A. had less assistance than he desired, it was not the fault of his Professional brethren, — the resident Practitioners and Members of the Association. We were invited by a letter from him to attend a meeting on the subject;: and we joined him in the invitation to the Association to visit this City. We were not again consulted; and those of us who are not Members of the University were not admitted to take part in the arrangements. 3 August, 1869. D d a.

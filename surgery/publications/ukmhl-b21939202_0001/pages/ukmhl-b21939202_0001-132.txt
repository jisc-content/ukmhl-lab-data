I20 Upon sounding the child, a calculus was felt with the curve of the staff: but so far forward that it seemed as if the calculus was not in the bladder. The child was evidently in a dying state; and after passing a fortnight in the ward, he was taken home by his Mother ; and died some few days afterwards. Upon examination of the abdomen, the signs of recent effusion of urine were visible in the hypogastric region. The bladder was contracted, and the coats were thickened.

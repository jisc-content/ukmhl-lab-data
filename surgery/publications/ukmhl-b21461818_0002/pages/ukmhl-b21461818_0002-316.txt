3Â®^ A TREATISE of the attempt, the eafe, and even fometimes the fafety of the patient, depending upon it. Whoever conceives, as many have done, and fome ftill do, that the teflicle hangs loofe in the middle of the water within the vadnal o coat (like a clapper within a bell) muft alfo fuppofe that every part of the general tumor is equally fit and prdpeF for this operation. The idea is erroneous, and the experiment may prove highly mifchievous'. All the ante^ rior and lateral parts of the vaginal coat are loofe and detached from the albuginea ; in its pofierior and fuperior part, thefe two tunics make one; confequently the tefticle is, as it were, affixed to the pofierior and fuperior part of the cavity of the fac of an hydrocele; and confequently, the watei; or fluid can never get quite round it.

ON THE HYDROCELE, SzC* ^^7 They were indeed, (as I have ah'eady ob- ferved) originally defigned to difcharge the water reUnquo, quod fenfim carnem corrodat, & ita fanat." An adhefion of the vaginal coat with the albuginea, may be the conlequencc of fuch treatment of an hydrocele, and confequently fuch patient may obtain a radical cure; but whoever has feen any thing of the difeafe properly called a farcocele, will know, that it will very feldom bear fuch rough treatment. This method of procuring a firm cure (by the tent) is men- tioned by Ruyfch: " Sanari quidem valet idmali pertufo fcroto, " ope inftrumenti touchart difl;o, vel lanceola phlebotomica, ut " aqua vulnere exeat, fed cito plerumque recrudefcit malum'. " Si autem curatlonem aggrederis aperiendo fcrotum a parte " fuperiori ad latus,, tumque vulmis turunda oblonga linguento " rofaceo, mercurio precipitato rubro inunfto oppleveris, *' donee lenis inflammatio, eique fuccedens fuppuratio parva,, *' membranulas ftillantes putrefecerit, tuncque eas tenaculo ** eduxeris," &c. Profefibr Monro, of Edinburgh, has propofed a method of cure upon the fame principle; but much better, and more likely to procure the one thing aimed at, (the lenis inflammatio) as he employs no catheretic medicines. His words are, Confidering how readily contiguous inflamed parts grow to- *' gether; and how many inflances there are, of people hav- *.* ing a radical cure made of this hydrocele, by inflamma- /â€¢ tions coming on the part; it vvpuld feem no unreafonable " pradlice, to endeavour a concretion of the two coats of the tellicle, when tihey are brought contiguous, after letting out *' the water through the cannula of a trocar, by artfully raifmg " a fufficient degree of inflammation. " This to be fure muft be done cautioufly, and fp that the *' furgeon can reafonably exped to be mafter of the inflamma- tion; and therefore the application of all irritating medi- " cines.

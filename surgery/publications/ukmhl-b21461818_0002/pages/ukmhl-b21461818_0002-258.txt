A TREATISE 246 later writers have often miftaken it for, and reprefented it as, a fpecies of wind-rupture, 01^ pneumatocele; a difeafe exifting in their imaginations only. It moft frequently pof- fefles the middle part of the ^rocefs, between the tefticle and groin, and is generally of an oblong figure; whence it has by fome people been compared to an egg, by others to a fifh's bladder. Whether it be large or fmall, it is generally pfetty tenfe, and confequently the fludtiation of the water within it, nofe always irhmediately or eafily perceptible; for which reafon it has been fuppofed to contain air Only. It gives no pain, nor (unlefs it be very large indeed) does it hinder any neceflary ' iliteftinorum hernia orta, copiofum liquorem in cadavere, ieftione aliquando deprehendi." And in a note on this paffage •fi'e adds, " Wiedemannus, nec noh Boerhavius, jtemque Garen- " geotiis & Dranius memorant iftiufmodi hydroceles cafus- quah- doque bbfervari; ubi digito contingi tefticulus queat; atque *' tunc fupra tefticulum in peritonei procelTu tumorem & hu- morem confiftere. In enterocele autem contrariuin quandoqiie " ufu venire, propterea quod inteftina interdum,ut fupra monui, ^ " ufque in tunicam vaginalem, per feptum illud naturale, quod tefticulum a parte fuperiori: proceffus peritonei diftinguit pe- •** netravferiint.'' " Sed rari admodum fint necefle eft, ad quos modalaudati " autbres provocant cafus. Ego fane quanquam plurimos homi- h^s enterocele, non minus quam hydrocele labdrantes fanave- '** rim, nunquam tamen adhuc ita rein invenij" &c. * adlion.

The water which conftitutes it being all contained in a bag, formed in the fame maimer as all the coats of all encyfted tumors are, viz. by mere preflure,- and condenfation of the common membrane. It is a complaint by no means infrequent, efpecially in children.

The laft has particularly dlftinguifhed this kind of hydrocele, from that of the tunica vaginalis, by a very juft defcription of both': " Si humor in membrana fupernata coierit, tumor alterius tefti- " culi imaginem exhibet. Quibus in Erythroide tunica humor comprehenfus eft tumor rotundus paululum, & ovi modo lon- /* giufculus: his tefticulus in confpeftum non venit, ut qui vm- diquaque lit implicitus." The former of thefe defcriptions our countryman Peter . Lowe, has moft probably copied, when he fays, " It is fome- V* . inclofed in a membrane, and appeareth like a third tef- " ticle." Heifter fpeaks of this fpecies of hydrocele as very rare, only quotes the authority of others to prove its exiftence, and feems in fome meafure to confound it with a colledlion of fluid in a con- genial hernial fac.

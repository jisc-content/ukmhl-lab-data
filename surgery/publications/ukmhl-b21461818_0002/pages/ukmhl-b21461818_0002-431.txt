ON THE Hydrocele, Szc, The the firil: attack on the body of the teftis: and, though the epididymis is often cancerous, yet it moft frequently becomes fo fecondarily, or after' the tefticle is fpoiled; fo that the removal of it, if prafticable, could ferve no good pur- pofe: it would not remove the difeafe; for that has, before-hand, moft commonly taken pofleffion of the tefticle; and the cutting off" any part of a fcirrhous or cancerous tumor of any kind, is what no man, who has the leaft knowledge of what he is about, will ever think of. In ftiort, thefe two Cafes, which by the in- attention and mifreprefentation of our ancef- tors, have created fuch perplexity in the minds of their readers, are either a fimple enlarge- ment of the epididymis, without any morbid alteration in its ftrudure; or a difeafed (that is a fcirrhous) ftate of the fame part j or elfe, a fcirrhous or cancerous tefticle, with inequa- lity of furface. The firft of thefe requires no manual operation of any kind; and the two laft will admit of none: the firft is no difeafe at all; and the two laft are fuch difeafes, that every attempt made on them, by knife or cauftic, (unlefs for total extirpation) muft ren- der them worfe, and mord intradable.

422 A TREATISE But thefe gentlemen carry their fears and apprehenfions much too far the other way. Pain and,a quick increafe of fize are certainly no favourable fymptoms ; they fliew a difpo- fition to mifchi^f, but they are not fuch po- thods, deftruftive and fallible as they are, have given credit and honour to thofe who have had ignorance and inhumanity enough to revive them. We are not yet fo happy as to be pofleffed of any medicine which will cure a cancerous habit: when the conftitution is thoroughly infefled, neither our knives or cauftics will avail; they can only remove the local mifchief, but can have no ef- fedl on the general one in the conftitution.

When the habit is concerned, as it too frequently is, it muft be an internal remedy that proves a fpecific, whenever we are fo happy as to be blelTed with the dif- covery. The fuppofition, that an efcharotic can, by deftroy- ing a particular part, eradicate the difeafe from the habit, is (one would be inclined to fuppofe) too grofs an abfurdity for the moft credulous believer to fwallow ; and yet it is believed, and trufted to every day. Indeed, it fometimes happens in the treatment of thefe cafes, that either the arrival of puberty, a favourable turn in a conftitution, or the renewal of long- obftrudted evacuations (efpeclally the uterine ones) lhall re- ftore the patient to a better ftate of health, and prevent either the farther progrefs of the diforder, or any new appearance of it in any other place. In this cafe, if the extirpation was made by an external application, and not by an inftrument, fuch ap- plication is thought to have wrought the cure, and has all the Credit of doing what it really had no lhare in then, what it never can do, nor have the appearance of doing again, but in the like accidental circumftances. fitive

Thit the cafe is a poiftble one I make no doubt, having once or twice fecn it in old ruptures; but it is a very rare one, and by no means to be admitted either as a proof that ' the mifchief done to the inteftine, in the ge- nerality of ftrangulated ruptures, does not moft frequently proceed from the ftriaure made by the tendon, or a diffuafive from per- forming an operation, whenever it would otherwife be thought neceffary.

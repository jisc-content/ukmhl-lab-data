ON THE HYDROCELE, &:c. 473 The fpermatic vefl'els were not at all altered from a natural ftate, except that the vein was varicofe. Immediately below the emulgent vejTels, on the right fide, was an irregular tu- mor, near as big as the kidney itfelf, perfe6lly fcirrhous,and firmly attached both to the renal blood-veflels, and to the aorta. The external part of this tumor was rough and unequal, arid of a whitifh colour : and in the centre of it were exa(Â£tly the fame appearances as within the tefticle, viz. a fmall quantity of matter, and a flough. Where the ureter was croffed by this tu- mor, it was much compreffed and ftraitened in its diameter; but below this ftridure it was confiderably dilated. The kidney was not quite healthy in its appearance. Had this man been caftrated, I make no doubt that his internal fcirrhus would have de- flroyed him; but that was a circumflance not to be collected from his general ftate, or from his complaints, and therefore not to be fore- known : the operation would therefore have been vindicable, though unfuccefsful.

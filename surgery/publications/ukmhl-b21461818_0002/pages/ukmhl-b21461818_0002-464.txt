A tRfiAtlSE In the cafe of a perfedly found and unal- tered fpermatie chord, in which the veflels are not become varicofe, and the operator can ttiake his divifion of them as low ashepleafes, this froiflement, this eontufion may be fuffi- cient to prevent an hasmorrhage; but in cafes where the fpermatie chord is enlarged, Mr. Le Dran himfelf does not think it fafe to truft to it. And that the veflels, from which a fcirrhous tefl:icle is dependent, may be confi- derably enlarged and diftended, and that pretty high, and yet not fo difeafed as to render the operation unadvifable or unfuccefsful, I have more than once or twice feen. The com- preflion which may be made, of the extremity " Tanneau." The remainder of this paragraph does indeed feem a kind of contradiftion of the preceding. " S'il eft tres- gonfle meme un plus haut que I'anneauy et qu'on ne puifTe fe " difpenfer de faire I'operation, il n'y a point de ligature a " faire; il faut fendre un pen I'anneau, puis eouper le cordon, " et I'artere ne donnera pas de fang." Set afide all confider- ation of the propriety or impropriety of performing the oper- ation, when the fpermatie chord is difeafed above the ring (as it is called) what can be the reafon, why the artery Ihould not be expedled to bleed, after being divided within the abdomen ? when the fame gentleman allows it to have produced a fatal haemorrhage, upon retiring into that cavity, or into the cellular membrane of the peritoneumi after having been cut off without the faid ring. of

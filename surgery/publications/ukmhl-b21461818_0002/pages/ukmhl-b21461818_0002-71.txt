ON RUPTURES, ^t) Among the ruptures which have been thought not reducible, and treated as fuch, there have been fome which, upon more judicious and more patient attempts, have been found capa- ble of reducation. When this is fufpefted to. be the cafe, the proper method is by abfolute reft, in a fupine pofture, for a confiderable length of time, by- great abftinence, and the ufe of evacuants, fo to leffen the ftze of the parts in the hernial fac as to render them capable of paffing back again into the belly. This method has now and then fucceeded, and in fome cafes is worth the trying; but, previous to the attempt, there fhould be fome circumftance which makes fuccefs probable; and there fhould alfo be good reafon to believe, that the habit and age of the patient will bear the neceflary confinement and evacuation; other wife, even though he fhould get rid of his rupture, he may be much worfted by the experiment f ner and left fide of it, at a great diftance from them, through " the whole of its courfe, but neverthelefs would not have been " in the way of the operation had it been neceflary." Hildanus gives an account of a man radically cured by fix months confinement to bed, in the cafe of a rupture of twenty years date.

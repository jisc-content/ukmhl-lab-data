33^ A TREATISE into the cells of the dartos, and by 'the imme^ diate collapfion of the vaginal coat, the oper^ ator will find fome difficulty in intr ;ducing either his finger or his inftrument into the orifice made in it; if he does not do this, he will divide only the Ikin and dartos, and the patient muft undergo a fecond incifion, for the divifion of the cyfi:; all which inconveni- ence may be avoided, by making the firfl opening large enough for the introduction of the finger; and when that is in, all the reft is, upon that, very eafily executed"*. When the vaginal tunic is divided, and the fluid thereby difcharged, the tefticle, covered only by its tmnca. albuginea, comes into view; and if the incifion was either begun, or febnti- nued very low, it generally thrufts itfelf out 'â€¢^ Some prasTtitioners, terrified at the accounts which they have received of the operation, and yet being defirous of pro- ducing a radical cure in this manner, have thought that they might leiTen the hazard, by reducing the fize of the incifion; and therefore make a very fmall one: but whoever depends upon this, will find himfelf miftaken. An incifion made one fourth of the length of the fac will be attended with all the trouble and hazard, which follow one of two thirds; with this additional inconvenience, that the former will very often prove inefFeftual at lall. from

I have feen a fatal gangrene, in a bubonocele, which had not been formed forty-eight hours, and in which the piece of inteftine was little more than half an inch. There are few prac- titioners who have feen bufinefs, but know the truth of this; but perhaps the reafon of it is not fufficiently explained to the unknow- ing^; it is this; when a confiderable portion of inteftine paffes out from the belly in a hernial fac, it neceffarily and unavoidably carries with it a proportional quantity of the mefentery, which every body knows is a ftrong double membrane.

ON THE HYDROCELE, &C. 185 liquors and ardent fpirits have been injefted, with a view to clofing or foldering broken lymphatics; tedious and painful operations have been praftifed, for the eradication of imaginary cyfts; direftions have been given tq evacuate the water at different times, left the patient's ftrength fhould fail, or his health fuffer, by its being done too fuddenly; and the tefticles being fuppofed to be frequently fpoiled, by long laying in the water, caftra- tion has often been performed in the fimple hydrocele. Dr. Monro (the father) who is profeflbr of anatomy at Edinburgh, and Mr. Samuel Sharp, late furgeon to Guy's hofpital, are almoft the only writers, who have fenfibly and rationally explained th'e true nature and theory of thefe difeafes: to them the profeffion is greatly obliged, for having thrown much light on the fubjed:; and for having furnifhed their readers with more juft ideas than any others.

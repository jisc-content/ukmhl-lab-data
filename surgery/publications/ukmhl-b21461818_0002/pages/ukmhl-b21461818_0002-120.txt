A TREATISE 8 It ' and properly be removed; no part of it is of any confequence except the pofterior, or that with which the fpermatlc veflels are con- ne6:ed; all the reft being loofe, by means of the cellular membrane, is therefore very eaiilv feparable, and had therefore better be removed than left removal of part of the fac might have been right whai the pracflice was to fill the cavity with dreflings, which induced a neceflity for the membranous fac to flough, but was very con- trary to Mr. Pott's pradice in the latter part of his life; and if , he had lived to produce a new edition of this treatife, as he had projeiSled, 1 have no doubt but that this paflage would have been altered- The method which we have long ufed, and which Mr. Pott himfelf praijlifed is this; when the contents of the fac are returned into the abdomen, the fides of the fcrotum are brought together, by which means the parts of the divided fac are alfo brought into contaft, a large armed needle is then palTed through the upper-part of the fcrotum near to the abdominal ring, and made to dip down fo as to pafs through the fides of the fac, but by no means fo deep as to run any rifk of including, or even injuring in the fmalleli degree the fpermatic vefTels, by which mode the objeftion in the paragraph which follows in the text, is done away; the ligature is then to be tied moderately faft, which makes a powerful barrier againft the reprotrufion of the inteftine ; two or three Hitches, according to the fize of the incifion, are then to be made through the fidcs of the divided fcrotum; there is no neceflity for thefe to pafs through the fac, as the only intention of them is to keep the parts together, fo as to prevent the expofure of the fac, by which means no digcllion of it will take place, but the parts will coalefce, and generally heal by the flrft intention.

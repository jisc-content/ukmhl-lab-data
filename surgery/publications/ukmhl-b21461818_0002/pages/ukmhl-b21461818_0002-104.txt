93 A TREATISE 6 t^^s turning a large portion arifing principally from the quantity of mefentery engaged in the flriÂ£lure; and, indeed, though it may now and then happen that a fmall piece of gut may be returnable without a divifion of the tendon, yet if it cannot be very eafily accom- plifhed, it had better not be attempted, fince in the ftate in which this part muft neceflarily be to require the operation thus far, any de- gree of force ufed to it will, mofl probably, be more prejudicial and ha^^ardous than the j-eft of it, if performed properly with a knife. An attention to the natural ftrudure, figure, and diredtion of the pai'ts will give us the beft information how to make the divifion of tlie ftridure to the beft purpofe, and with the Jeaft hazard. The tendon of the obliquus defcendens mufcle runs in an oblique diredlion from above downward, and the natural opening which is always found in it, and through which the hernia pafles, is made by a kind of feparation pfthe fibres'from each other; the direaion of this opening is th^ifame as that of the tendon, that is, obliquely downward, from the os ilion to the. os pubis; the knife, therefore ihculd be fo managed, as rather to continue

Under this tendon, or hgament, the parts compofing a hernia pafs, and produce a tumor on the upper and fore-part of the thigh. The fac is generally defcribed as paffing over the crural artery and vein, which are faid to lie immediately behind it; but whoever will ex- ajmine the ftate of thefe parts, in a dead fub- jedt, will find that this is not a true reprefen- tation: the defcent is made on one hde of thefe veflels, nearer to the os pubis; and the hernial fac, if it be not greatly diftended, lies between the crural veflels, and the lafl men- tioned bone, on which it refts. The femoral hernia is not fo fubjedl to ftriÂ£lure as the inguinal, there being a larger fpace for the inteftine to occupy; but when fuch mifchief does happen, the fymptoms are fo exactly the fame as they are in a ftrangu- lated inguinal hernia, that it is quite unne- ceffary to repeat them in this place.

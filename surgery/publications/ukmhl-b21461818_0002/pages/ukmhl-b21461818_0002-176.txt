1^4 A TREATISE The punBum aureum was performed as follows. The inteftines being emptied by piirging, and the hernia reduced, an incifion was made through the Ikin and membrana adipofa, down to the fpermatic procefs. This incifion was to be of fuch length, as to permit the operator, either with his finger or with, a hook, t^ take up the faid procefs, and to pafs a golden wire under it; which wire was to be twifled in fuch a manner as to prevent the inteftine from flipping down again into the hernial fac, but not fo tight as to inter- cept or obftrud: the circulation of the blood to the tefticle. Some operators preferred a leaden wire to a golden one, and others a filken ligature. It may poffibly feem rather uncivil to fay, that both this and the fucceeding operation were directed and pradifed by people who were very little acquainted with the true na- ture and ftrufture of the parts they operated upon, or indeed of the difeafe for which they prefcribed fuch operation; but had not that been the ca^fe, they never could have propofed fo fallacious and uncertain a method of treat- ing it; for if the wire, or whatever was pafl'ed round the procafs, did not bind pretty tight.

A TREATISE 33^ {ion; which is a circumftance of more cohfe- qiience to the patient, than is imagined; efpe- cially cither produced or maintained By the injudicious application of painful dreffings, are much more frequent than they are thought to be: not to mention the lofs of time which they muft always caufe, and the very difagreeable deformities they often occalion. The furgery of moft of our forefathers was coarfe and rough; and many of the praftitioners affedled a kind of brutal, unfeel- ing ruftlclty. The old maxim, " Dolor medicina doloris," was fo generally received, that the furgeon almoft forgot his pa- tient's fenfation; and the common people thought they were ne- glefted, if they were not tortured.

J44 A tRBiAf 19^ ftriaure made by the fac of one of thefe hct^ niÂ«, as produced all thofe bad fymptoms which render the operation neceffary ; and I have met with two different ftridures, at near an inch diftance from each other, in the body of a dead boy about fourteen, one of .which begirt the inteftine fo tight, that I could not difengage it without dividing the fac. In this kind of hernia I have alfo more fre- quently found connexions and adhefions of the parts tp each other, than in the common one; but there is one kind of connexion fometimes met with in the congenial hernia, which can never be found in that which is in a common hernial fac, and which may require all the dexterity of an operator to fet free ; I mean that of the inteftine with the tefticle^ from which I have more than once experi- enced a good deal of trouble. When a common hernial fac has been laid open, and the inteftine and omentum have been replaced, there .can be nothing left in ic which can require particular regard from the furgeon; but by the divilion of the fac of a congenial hernia, the tefVicle is laid bare, and after the parts compofing the hernia have been reduced, will require great regard and tender- nefs.

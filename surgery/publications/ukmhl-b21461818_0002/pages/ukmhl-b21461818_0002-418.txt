4Q0 A TREATISE methocl of practice. For, by conceiving that the noxious quahty of the fluid produces a fungous or flefliy excrefcence on the furface of the tefticle, they have fuppofed, that after havino- difcharged the faid fluid from its con- taining bag, they could, either by eftabUlhing a fuppuration, or by ufing efcharotic medicines, wafte or deftroy the faid excrefcence, and ob- tain a radical cure of the whole difeafe. Now the fcirrhofity of the tefticle being the origi- nal difeafe, and the extravafation a mere acci- dent, fuch treatment can never do. any mate- rial good, and may often be the caufe of very elTential evil.

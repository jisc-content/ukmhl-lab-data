ON THE HYDROCELE, &C. 44I If any confiderable artery bleeds, either iii the fcrotum or in the dartos, it muft be re- trained by ligature; and when that is done, the void fpace in which the teflicle was, is ta be very lightly filled with foft dry linf^; which ' Lint, however foft and lightly applied, afts as a foreiga body, and prevents the immediate union of the wound. Our prefent method, and which Mr. Pott praftifed fince his publi- cation of this work, appears to be a confiderable improvement on this part of the operation:—when the teftis is removed, and the bleeding veffels of the fcrotum, if there are any of confe- quence, are fecured, no lint, nor dreffing of any kind is intro- duced ; "but the parietes of the wound are brought together and retained by ligatures, more or fewer, according to the extent of the wound, as, from the moifture of the parts, fticking-plafter cannot be depended on: thefe ligatures Ihould be tied with flip knots, that they may be loofened, without a neceflity being in- duced of removing them, in cafe of any frefh hasmorrhage, which fometimes happens after the patient is warm in bed; dry lint is then applied and kept on by a fimple dreffing, avoiding every thing greafy on the edges of the wound: by thefe means the parts unite and heal in great meafure by the firft intention ; or, if any colleftion of matter is formed in the cavity which the teftis occupied, it will be in fmall quantity, and eafily difcharged by the lower part of the wound, which muft form a depending and an advantageous opening; after which the granulations will gradually fill the fpace, and the cure will be but little' re- tarded. This exceiknt plan of preferving as much found and ■undifeafed fkin as poffible, and putting no obflruftions in the way of Nature's healing powers, has of late years been applied to almoft every fpecies of tumor which it may be neceffary to remove, and may be cfteemed one of the greateft improvements of modern furgery. , E. lint

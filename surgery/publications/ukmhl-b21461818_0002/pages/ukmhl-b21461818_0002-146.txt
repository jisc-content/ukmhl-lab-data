A TREATISE SECT. IX, The crural, or femoral hernia, receives its namefrom its fituation,the tumor occafioned by it being in the upper and fore-part of the thigh. To underiland rightly the nature and fitu- ation of a crural rupture, it is neceffary to at- tend to the anatomical ftruÂ£lure and difpoiition of the obliquus defcendens mufcle of the ab- domen. Whoever does this will find, that that part of it which runs obliquely down- ward from, the fpine of the os ilion, towards the fymphyfis of the os pubis, is tucked down, and folded inward, as it were. This edge or border, fo folded in, is what is called the ligamentum Poupartii by fome, by others the Ugamentum Fallopii, as if it was a diflin^t and feparate body, but is really no more than the inferior border of the tendon of the ob- lique mufcle. In all the fpace between thefe two attachments, this tendon is loofe and un- connected with any bone; all the hollow, which is made by the form of the os ilion, between the point of the attachment of the ligament or tendon to that bone, and its other connexion at the os pubis, is filled up by cellular me m.brane, fat, and glands; which parts

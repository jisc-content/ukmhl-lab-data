^74 A TREATISE have fuppofed that the fluid contained in the tunica vaginahs teftis may not only conftitute a difeafe by the mere diftention of it, but may be produ<ftive of other difeafes of the tcfticle itfelf. They have fancied the water to have in itfelf a noxious quality, or difpofition; and that the tefticle, by merely fwimming in it, might become difeafed, and unfit for ufe; whereas in cafes wherein a difordered ftate of the teftis accompanies a colle£bion of water in its vaginal coat, the truth is juft the reverfe of this fuppofition: the teftis is firft difeafed, and the faculty of equal, regular abforption thereby interrupted; by which means a quan- tity of fluid is accumulated, and that mixed appearance produced, which is not improperly called hydro'farcocele. But in this cafe, the extravafation of water is really the confe- quence of the morbid ftate of the gland; and (being ftill mere fimple lymph) neither is, nor can be the caufe of it. They who chufe it, may call this a fpecies of hydrocele; and the literal fenfe of the word will certainly vindicate them; but they will •by that means run the rifk of confounding to- gether, two things extremely unlike to each pther, and which require very different treat- ment;

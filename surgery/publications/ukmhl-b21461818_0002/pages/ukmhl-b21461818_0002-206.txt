The time when this happens is various and uncertain; I have feen them perfectly clofed within a week, and open at. the end of twa months, nor do they both iieeeffarily be- come clafe at the fame time, in the fame fubjeÂ£t. It fometimes happens, that while thefe paf- fages are open, a piece of intefline infmuates iffelf into one of them, and, preventing its clofmg, produces what Haller calls a: conge- nial hernia; a difeafe which, though a mo- dern difcovery, has always been very, fre- quent. It alfo fometimes happens, that the fpermatic veifels not being fufficiently clofed, one of the tefticles refts in the groin, juft without the opening in the abdominal muf- cle, and by not becoming pendulous in the fcrotum, the orifice of the neck of the faccu- lus is not clofed at all; even though no por- tion of gut or caul has got into it. When thefe orifices have been onee per- feaiy clofed, there never is any futur^ com- munication between the cavities of the facculi and that of the belly ; nor can anything folid or fluid (however fmall in fize or quantity) ever.

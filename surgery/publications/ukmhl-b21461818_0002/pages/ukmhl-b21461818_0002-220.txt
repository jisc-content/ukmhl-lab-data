A TREATISE Other, with the utmoft freedom through every parti As this nieinbrane has no immediate com- munication with the cavity of the abdomen within the peritoneum, it is plain, that what- ever kind or quantity of fluid may be depo- lited in it, it cannot be derived from the faid cavity, even though the patient fhould labour under a true afcites; but as its cells have a free intercourfe with thofe of the general cel- lular membrane all over the body, they will be liable to be afFeded by all thofe diforders which have their feat in that membrane j that is, by all diforders proceeding from a low im- poverifiied ftate of blood, from a deficiency of the urinary fecretion, or from non-execution of the office of the abforbent veffels; and con- fequently, in anafarcous and leucophlegmatic habits, will becotne the feat of Jl watery ex- travafation. This watery fwelling of the fcrotum, al- though it be moft frequently a fymptom of a dropfical habit, and very often accompanies both the general anafarca, and the particular colleÂ£tion within the abdomen, called the af- cites, yet, even in the latter cafe, neither is, nor can be, derived from the cavity of the belly.

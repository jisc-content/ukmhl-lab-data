54 A TREATISE is alfo no infrequent caufe, why negleded omental ruptures become irreducible. The cellular membrane in all parts of the body, however loofe and light its natural tex- ture may l^e, is capable of becoming hard, firm, ai^d compadt, by conftant prelFure. Of this there are fo many, and fo well known inftances, that it is quite unneceffary to pro- duce any. The omentum, from its texture, is liable to the fame confequence. When a portion of it has been fufFered to remain for a great lensth of time in the fcrotum, without hav- ing ever been returned into the belly, it often happens that although that part of it which is in the lower part of the hernial preferves its natural foft, adipofe, expanfile ftate, yet all that part which paffes through what is called the neck of the fac is, by conftant preffure, formed into a hard, firm, incom- preffible, carnous kind of body, incapable of being expanded, and taking the form of the paffage in which it is confined, exadly fiUing that paffage, and rendering it impolfible to pufh up the loofe part which fills the fcro- tum. This is no theoretic opinion, but a faÂ£l, whic(i

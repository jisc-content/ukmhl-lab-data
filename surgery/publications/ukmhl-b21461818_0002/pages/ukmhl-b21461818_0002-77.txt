Thefe are the very firfl fymp- toms, and if they are not reUeved, are foon followed by others, viz. a ficknefs at the fto- mach, a frequent reaching, or incHnation to vomit, a ftoppage of all difcharge per anum, attended with a frequent hard puife, and fome degree of fever. A patient in thefe eircurnfiances may be looked upon as in fome danger, and requiring immediate afliftance. A ftridure made on the prolapfed part of the gut, by the borders of the natural aperture in the tendon of the obhque mufcle, is the immediate caufe of thefe lymptoms which nothing can appeafe or remove, except what will take off that ilridlure. This can be accomplifhed only by removing the part fo bound from the tendi- nous opening; that is, by returning it back into the belly whence it came; or by dividing a part of the tendon itfelf: the former of thefe, when it can be praÂ£lifed, is always moft eli- gible, and makes our prefent fubjed.

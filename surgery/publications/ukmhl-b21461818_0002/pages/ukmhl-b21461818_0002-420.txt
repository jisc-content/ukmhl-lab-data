The cure (when it efFe6ts one) is not brought about by the deftruftion of an excrefcence from the tefticle, or the dlffolution of its fup- pofed induration; but merely by exciting fuch an inflammation, as fliall occafion an adhefion of the tunica vaginalis to the tunica' albuginea; by which means, the cavity of the former is obliterated; the tefticle remaining, as to fize and confiftence, juft as it was before fuch oper- ation was performed^. But this, though prac- ticable, s Another method of treating this difeafe, In ufe before Fa- brltius ab Aquapendente (as may be feen in Guido and others) and much preferable, if ufed in proper cafes, is the method by feton. This, as I have already obferved, I have feveral times prac- tifed with fuccefs, in thofe who would not fubmit to incifion, or in whom it was by no means proper.

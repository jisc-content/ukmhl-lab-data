ON RUPTURES. ought always to be performed as foon as pof- fible after it appears that all rational attempts, by large and free bleeding, the warm batji,. glyfters, &c." are found to be inefFeÂ£lual, or. that the. fymptoms rather increafe than de- creafe, while fuch means are made ufe of, and that the^ handling neceflary for redudliori becomes more and more painful; for if it be delayed until the inflammation has attained a certain height, tkough the parts upon ^ being ^ Perhaps I may be thought fomewhat lingular, but from what I have feen, I am much inclined to believe, that whea the parts are very painful to the touch, and the fcrotum large, and much upon the ftrefs, more harm is generally done by the manual attempts for reduftion, than good. In this ftate, the great diftention of the intelline renders it very incompfeflible, and very little likely to be returned through the tendinous aperture by mere force, (for fuch it is, in whatever degree it be ufed) and either a bri(k irritating purge, or a very ftimu- lating glyfter, (particularly the tobacco-fmoke) are more likel}', by exciting the perillaltic motion, to difentangle it, than even the moll judicious method of handling it. And in cafes where fuch remedies have been previoufly ufed, I verily believe the fudden redu^ion of thepiege of gut is often more owing to their efFeft than to that of the hand. But I muft de- lire that this may be rightly underftood, and not miftaken for a dilTuafive againft manual attempts for reduftion; I only mean, that there is fuch a ftate of an inc'arcerated inteftine, (which ftate I havejuftdefcribed) In which, from its fize, inflamma- tion, diftention, &c. compreflion by the hand is very little likely to procure its return,;and very likely, if it does ngt dp fo, to do coi)fiderable mifchief.

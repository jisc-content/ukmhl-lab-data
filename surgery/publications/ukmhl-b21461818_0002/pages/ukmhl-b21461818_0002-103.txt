ON RUPTURES. The fac being laid open, the inteftine ge^ ^erally puftie^ pnt ixrimediately, (unlefs it i$ confined, by being inveloped in the omentum) and appears to be much more in quantity than it feemed to be, while it was confined within the fcrotum. This is the time to try whether by gently drawing out a little more of the gut, its bulk cannot be fp reduced as to enable the furgeon to retura it back into the belly, without di- viding the tendon. In the cafe of the protru- iion of'a very fmall piece of inteftine it has been found pi-afticable, the difficulty of re- well as more properly, in order' to return them into the belly, both which neceffary parts of the operation are much impeded by a fmall incifion.

It is t^ue, that upon fuch divifion the quantity of inteftine will feem to be increafed, and an ignorant by-ftander jnay be alarmed at this fallacious appearance, which is produ- ced inerely by the confined comprefled gut being fet free, and not by the addition of any more. The advantage which will arife to the pperator, and confequently to the patient, from fuch divifion, is real and great, it will enable the former to finifh his work with freedom^ and fpare the letter a great deal tifpain, turning

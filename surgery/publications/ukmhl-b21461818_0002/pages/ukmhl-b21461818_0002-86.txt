Recent hernias are in general more liable to ftridure than old ones, for reafons which are obvious from what has already been faid; but when old ones get into the fame circum- fiances, the fymptoms are much the fame ; though I think in general they are not alto- gether fo prefling, and the latter generally admit of more time to attempt redudion m. The fmaller the portion of inteftine is which is engaged, the greater the pain is, and the more haftily do the fymptonis advance.

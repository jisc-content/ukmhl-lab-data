( 9 ] A TREATISE, &c. SECTION I. By tiie term Rupture, Descent, or Hernia, is in general meant a fwelling pro- duced by the falling down or protrufion of fome part or parts, which ought naturally to be contained within the cavity of the belly. The places in which-thefe fwellings make their appearance, in order to form what is called a Rupture, are the groin, the navel, the labia pudendi, the upper and fore part of the thigh, and every point of the anterior part of the abdomen. The parts, which by being thruft forth from the cavity in which they Â©ught natu- rally to remain, form thefe tumors, arc a por- tion of the omentum, a part of the inteflinal canal, and *fometimes (though very rarely) the ftomach. * The liver, fpleen, uterus, bladder, &c. have at difFerent times been found in different hernia, but thefe are fo rare as not to come within a general defcription.

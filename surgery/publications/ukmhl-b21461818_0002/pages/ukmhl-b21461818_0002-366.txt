35^ A TREATISfe neceflary ! the mere divifion of the facc utus '% aiid the application of dry lint to its infide, will, in general, if not always, reftrain the haemorrhage, and anfwer every purpofe, for which fo fevere a remedy has been prefcribed^ The other two are indeed Â©f more confe- quence; they intereft either the tefticle itfelf, or the veflels by which it is fupplied with blood, and retider^d capable of executing its ^ It may indeed happen, that the blood of the patient may be in fuch ftate, as to be incapable of coagulation : in which cafe, the haemorrhage will continue from the infide of the fac, al- though it be laid open; and alfo from all the divided parts. This circumftance, though a very hazardous one, cannot ba * forefeen; nor do I know, in this ftate of the juices, what bene- fit can arife from the removal of the tefticle: for the haemor- rhage will certainly be continued, from all parts of the wound necelTary in fuch operation, upon the fame principle, and for the fame reafon that it could not be reftrained from the in- fide of the fac. Such an indifpofition of blood is often, in cachedlic habits, the caufe of very troublefome and fatal hemorrhages, at fome diftance of time from amputation, as well as immediately. If this want of an agglutinant quality in the blood is not correded, or is not capable of correftion, it generally goes hard with the patient, let the operation be what or where it may: for it is not merely the fuppreffion pf the bleeding that is required; the fame ill quality of blood will prevent fuppuration, produce bloody, fanious gleeting, gangrene and mortification.

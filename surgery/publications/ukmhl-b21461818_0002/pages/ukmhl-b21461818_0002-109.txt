Very bad fjmptoms, fuch as pain, tenfion of the belly, ficknefs, vomiting, hiccough, fever, and fupprelfion of ftools, are often pro- duced in a very fhort fpace of time by the defcent of a piece of gut, upon fome exertion of ftrength in perfons who were immediately before fuch accident at perfed eafe, and free from all complaints relative to the belly: if the difeafe be not difcovered, -pr. iif our at- tempts to reduce the inteftine are not fucceff- ful, thefe fymptoms are heightened, and the patient often dies of a mortification ; if we do fucceed in the timely reduaion, all thefe terrible lymptoms often ceafe inftantaneoufly, and the patient feels neither pain nor inconvenience of any kind from that moment.

P R E F A C E. The difeafe ivhich makes the fubjeÂ£l of the following traft, is one in which mankind are, on many accounts, much interefted; no age, fex, rank, or condition of life, ,is exempt from it; the rich, the poor, the lazy, and the labo- rious, are equally liable to it; it produces certain incon- venience to all who are afflidted by it; it fometimes puts the life of the patient in fuch hazard, as to require one of the moft delicate operations in furgery; and it has in all times, from the moft ancient, down to the prefent, ren- dered thofe who labour under it fubjedt to the moft ini- quitous frauds and impofitions. The generality of mankind look upon a rupture as an imperfeaion in their form, as a difeafe which impairs their ftrength, and le/Tens their generative faculty: which appre- henfions, though abfolutely groundlefs, are fo firmly rooted, in the majority of thofe who are affliaed with the diforder, as to make them not a little miferable. They who lie in wait to avail themfelves of the weaknelTes of the infirm and fearful, are well acquainted with thefe fears, and very lucra- tive- ufe do they make of them; they well know, that the man who regards his diforder as an imperfeaion in his form, or as a caufe of any debility, more particularly a venereal one, will be very unwilling to have it known, and as glad to get rid of it, at any cxpence or trouble ; by this means thefe impoftors are furniflied with opportunities of fubjea- ing the ignorant, and credulous, to tedious confinements, painful applications, and even hazardous operations; and of defrauding the timorous and bafhful of large fums of mo- ney, for imaginary difeafes, and pretended cures.

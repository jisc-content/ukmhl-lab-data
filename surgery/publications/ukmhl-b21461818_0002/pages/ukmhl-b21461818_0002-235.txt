I Ihall therefore only add, that from the fimple piindure I havefeldom met v^^ith either; and that I have as feldom known them fail to anfwer the purpofe for which they were in- tended, viz. a temporary difcharge of ferum from the cellular membrane. SECT. V. If we confider the preceding complaint as merely fymptomatic, and do not rank it among the different kinds of hydrocele, there will then remain only three, viz. 1. That which confifts of a colle<5lion of water in the cells of the tunica communis, or cellular membrane, iuveloping and conneding the fpermatic velTels. 2.

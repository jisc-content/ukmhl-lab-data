6N TtiE liiYiDROCfeLE, SzC. 403 ticable, and fometimes fuccefsfal in the hy* drocele> is not to be thought of in the difeafed or fcirrhous tefticlei The operation, as de- ibribed by Aqnapendente^ confifls of two points; firft to let out the waterj, and then to caufe a plentiful fuppuration.

The matter is of no reaJ ufe, and therefore it is fo far from being neceflary to confine it, that if the conjunftion of the coats can be obtained, without the formation of any, it is fo much the better.

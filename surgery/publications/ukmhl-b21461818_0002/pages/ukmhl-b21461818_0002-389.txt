OK THE Hydrocele, &cÂ» ^^^i tontained a fluid ; but the fluctuation of that fluid was not (to my fingers) like the fludlu- ation of water. In all the polterior part of the tumor^ an enlarged^ and fomewhat hard- ened tefticle might plainly be diftinguifhed s and the general weight of the whole, far ex- ceeded that of any hydrocele I had ever met with of equal fize. That it was not a mere Ample hydrocele I was very clear: but, whe-^ ther it was a colledlion of fluid in the tunica vaginalis of a difeaffed tefticle (what is in ge- neral called a hydro-farcocele) or what other morbid or altered ftate of parts it might be owing to, I would not pretehd to fay. A punflure was made in it with a fmall trocar; and about four ounces of dark-coloured blood, not fo fluid as blood generally is while circu- lating in its proper veflels, was drawn off; a bit of plafter and lint was applied to the ori- fice, and the man went about his bufinefs. In two days the fame furgeon brought the man to me again. The puncture was healed; but the tumor was as large as when I had feen it two days before, and palpably con- tained the fame kind of fluid. What that was we knew: ancl the confideration was, vv'hat was the propercfi: method of giving the maa Bb 2 jelief.

14 A TREATISE have no lhare in the embarraffment of the parts contained in a hernial fac, nor require any divilion in that operation, which becomes fometimes neceffary towards fetting them free: which is a fa6t of no fmall confequence to an operator. The infide of thefe mufcles, and indeed the whole cavity of the belly, is lined with a fmooth, firm, but eafily dilatable membrane, called the peritoneum, a minute account of which would lead me befide my prefent pur- pofe, and therefore I iliall only obferve, that it lines the whole abdomen, and gives an ex- ternal coat to every vifcus contained in it. Behind the peritoneum lies a loofe, cellular membrane, by fome called its appendix, which is found in different quantity in different places. ' In fome the cells are empty, and are immedi- ately yifible upon being blown into ; in other parts it is plentifully flocked with fat, and, every furgeon be informed that the external oblique mufcle is the only one which has any opening in it; that the defcriptioii given by Mr. Chefelden of thefe mufcles, in the laft edition of liis anatomy, is erroneous; and all defcriptions and all deli- neations (fome of which are to be found even in later writers) of more openings than that fingle one on each fide, are not re- prefentations of nature, but are the images of a luxuriant fancy, and have no foundation in truth. though

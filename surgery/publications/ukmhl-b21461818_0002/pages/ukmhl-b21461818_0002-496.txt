47^ A TREAttSEi He as fiirgeons, and a third gentleman as a p{iy^ iiaan. The two former advifed immediate caftra- tlon; the laft feemed to wifti him to take the cicuta, or the folanum, medicines then in falhion. The thought of caftration'fliocked him fo much, that he willingly embraced any hints concerning fpecifics. He took the cicuta fer more than two months, beginning with a fmall dofe, and in* creafing it gradually to very large ones. It now and then made him a little fick and giddy; but the difeafe increafed under it fo manifeftly, that I was apprehenfive that we were doino* much worfe than merely lofing time. I fig- nifiedmy fufpicion, and prefTed the operation; but he would not hear of it. The folanum was now tried under the di- redion of the do£lor; but it difagreed fo much, even in the fmallefl quantity, that there was no poffibility of perfifting in it. Upon this, as upon mofl occafions of this kind, every acquaintance recommended either ■ afpecihc or a quack: moft of which wefe tried, and I faw no more of my patient for above four montlis.

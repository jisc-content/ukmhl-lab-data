If the piece of gut or caul defcends no lov^er than the groin, it is faid to be incomplete, and is called bubonocele'; if the fcrotum be occupied by either of them, the rupture is faid to be complete, and bears the name of ofcheocele: the latter ufed by our forefathers to be attributed to laceration of the peritoneum, the former to its dilatation merely. The opinion, that the fcrotal hernia is occa- fioned by a forcible divifion,, or breach made in the peritoneum, has always been, and ftiU is, with the unknowing, a very prevaihng one, thsugh without any foundation in truth; both

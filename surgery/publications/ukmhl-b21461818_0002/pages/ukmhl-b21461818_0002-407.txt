ON THE HYDROCELE, &C. -389 Every fpecies of farcocele conlifts primarily in an enlargement, induration, and obll:ruÂ£lion of the vafcular part of the teflicle; but this alteration is, in different people, attended with fiich a variety of circumftances, as to produce feveral different appearances ; and to occafion the many diftin6tions which have been made. If the body of the teflicle, though enlarged and indurated to fome degree, be perfectly equal in its furface, void of pain, has no ap- pearance of fluid in its tunica vaginalis, and produces very little uneafinefs, except what is occaiioned by its mere weight, it is ufually called a fimple farcocele, or an indolent fcir- rhus. If, at the fame time that the teftis is enlarged and hardened, there be a palpable ac- cumulation of fluid in the vaginal coat, the difeafe has by many been named a hydro-far- cocele. If the lower part of the fpermatic veffels and the epididymis were enlarged, hard, and knotty, they fuppofed it to be a fungous or morbid acretion, and called it the tefticulis oriuntur. Tumor hie eft durus, tadlui renitens, " indolens, et fi exquifitus fit fcirrhus, fenfu caret. Si a me- " lancholia oriatur, color fublividus; fi a pituita, colorem cu- " tis non mutat; fi a melancholia fiiperaffata, dolor pundlo- " rius, et inequalis tumor; hie durus, Ibi mollis."

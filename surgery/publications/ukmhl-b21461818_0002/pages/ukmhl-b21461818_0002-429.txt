ON THE HYDROCELE, &C. 41I In the Ihort anatomical account which I have given of thefe parts, I have taken no notice, that the Ipermatic veffels terminate in the tefticle: and that, after the femen has been fecreted from the blood, it pafles from that gland into a body which feems fuperadded to, although it be really continuous with, it. This body is therefore called the epididymis, and is fo placed, with regard to the teftis, that a heed- lefs or uninformed obferver may fuppofe, that the fpermatic veffels terminate in it; efpecially if it be enlarged by difeafe. It takes its rife from the tefticle, by a number of veffels, called, from their office, vafa efferentia: thefe foon become one tube, which, being convo- luted and contorted in a moft wonderful man- ner, forms the greater part of the faid body: and at laft, ceafing to be fo convoluted, it ends in one firm canal, called the vas deferens; by which, the fecreted femen is conveyed from the tefticle to the veficulae feminales. Whoever will attentively confider the epidi- dymis in its natural pofition, with regard to the tefticle and the fpermatic veflels, will fee, that if it be enlarged beyond its proper fize, it will extend itfelf upward, in fuch a manner as to f(?em to be clofely conneded with them, and

4i8 A TREATISE commended and praftifed by every honefl and judicious furgeon ^. Indeed ^ Scirrhous and cancerous tumors are found in many parts of the body, as well as in the tefticle ; and in all others, as well as in that, bear different charaders: that is, fliow a greater or lefsdifpofition to malignity; remaining fometimesof fmall fize, and eafy for many years; at others, increafing fall, and fo producing great pain, and all its bad confequences. Of all the kinds of this difeafe, thofe which follow upon fome external violence (fuch as blow, bruife,&c.) are thought and faid to be the Jeaft ; therefore, great regard has. always been paid to this diftinftion by writers, and great hopes con- ceived from this circumftance by patients. I wifli I could fay, that fuch hopes were always as well founded as- they are thought to be : I mean, that experience moll frequently veri- fied them. When a fcirrhus feizes a part that has previoufly fuftained an injury from without, fuch probable caufe is undoubtedly a favourable circumllance: but it does not, by any means, necelTary follow from thence, that the conIlituti9n of fuch per- fon is free from taint. It is a prefumption, but not a proof: and this prefumption becomes more reafonable, if the difeafed Hate of the part follows fuch accidental injury foon, than if it appears at a great diftance of time. No .man will pretend to fay, that fuch mifchief has not been done by outward violence, that cancerous diforders have not followed, in the parts fo injured, in perfons, who, before fuch accident, never had any appearance of fucli diforder; and who poflibly might have lived many years, nay, their whole life, without its appearing in fuch form and manner: but that, previous to fuch accident, there was no cancerous difpo- fition or malignity in the habit, is an inference which cannot be admitted.

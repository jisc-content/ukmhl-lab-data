it A TREATISE portion of the peritoneum, including tlie piecrtf of gut or caul, is known by the name of the hernial fac, and is larger, or fmalier, according to the quantity of inteftine, or omentum,- contained in it: it is at firft fmall and thiuy and in ruptures which are not of the conge- nial kind, feldom comes lower than the groin ^, at firft, but by repeated defcents it extends kfelf lower and lower, till it gets quite into the fcrotum, and ftillas it is extended in length, it becornes thicker and firmer in texture, till in old age, or old ruptures^ it is found of very eonfiderable thicknefs. As all parts of the peritoneum are of ayery extenfiblcj dilatable nature, and as the hernial fac has this property in common with many other parts of the body, of thickening as it extends^ it does in fome cafes ftretch to a very eonfiderable fize, and contain fuch a quantity of inteftine andi omentum as is almoft incre- dible. This circumftance of its becoming thicker as it is more extended is perhaps the d I will not fay pofitively that all thofe ruptures which appear in the fcrotum of very young children are f J'/^J^^^;; have the tunica vaginalis teftis for their hermal fac) but all tiiofe which I have had an opportunity of examining have proved fo ; and I believe it would be no erroneous criterion whereby to diftinguifh tlie common rupture from the congcmal, xn infant.,.

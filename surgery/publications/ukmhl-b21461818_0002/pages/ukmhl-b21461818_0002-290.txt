When the difeafe is a perfed, true, fimple hydrocele, the tefticle, though frequently fomewhat enlarged, and perhaps loofened in its vafcular texture, is neverthelefs (as I have already obferved) found, healthy, and capable of executing its proper office; neither is the Ipermatic chord any way altered from a natu? ral ftate, except that its vefifels are generally fomewhat dilated; neither of which circum- flances are objedions either to the palliative or radical cure of the difeafe.

4^4 A TREATISE: The manner of treating a farcocele, or fiel'-^ nia carnofa, depends entirely on the particular' nature and ftate of each individual cafe. In fome, it will admit of palliation only; in others, the difeafe may be eradicated by the extirpation of the part: fo that, under the article of method of cure, we have only to confider, and point out, as clearly as the na- ture of the difeafe will permit, what ftates and circumflances, both of it, and of the pa- tient labouring under it, forbid the operation, and what render it advifable. On this head, great variety of opinions will be found among writers ; fo great, that a man, who is under a neceflity of forming his judgment from them, will find himfelf under fome difficulty how to aft; and fo great, that I cannot help thinking it to be clear, that the majority have not written from practice, but from mere conjefture, of from the works of thofe who have gone be- fore them. Some have given it as then* opinion, that while the tefticle is perfeÂ£lly indolent (let the alteration in its ftrufture, form, or confidence be what it may) it is better to fufler It to re- main, than to remove it.

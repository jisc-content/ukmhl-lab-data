334 A TREATISE In about fix weeks, the fcrotum is generally reduced to nearly its natural fize; and when the t would be very cautious, how I made objeclion to what fo many have recommended; and, in a matter of mere fpeculalion, would rather doubt my own judgment!, than that of fome others: but this is a fad, of which I have too often been co'nvinced, to be miftaken; and, therefore, I cannot help frying, that it appears to me, that all applications of this kind, even the mildeft of them, (the red precipitate) are generally very improperly ufed; that they give unneceffary pain; and retard, what they are ufed with defign to expedite.- Inflammatory hardnefs and tumefadlion is not peculiar to the fcrotum, upon its being wounded: it is common to all parts of fimilar ftrufture; that is, the adipofe and cellular membrane all over the body. When fuch parts are irritated by a large wound,- they cannot refift a fudden influx; the confequence of which muft, for a time, be obftruftion, induration, and fwelling: but, one moment's re- fieftion on the natural ftrufture and ftate of thefe parts, before fuch wound was inflifted, or fuch irritation excited, will prove that eafe, relaxation, and free fuppuration, muft be the intentions proper to be purfued; and that every application, which either ftimulates, gives pain, or corrodes, muft pervert and counteraa: fuch intentions. The breafts of women, the axilla of both fexes, the parts fur- rounding the inteftinum reftum, the cellular membrane in the pe- rinxum, under the integuments of the penis, and in feveral other parts of the body, are liable to this Icind of alteraition, when in- jured; but this induration is very unlike to a glandular one, and requires very different treatment. In the latter, a deftruclion of parts isfometimes neceffary, and efcharotic medicines may there- fore be required: but in the former, mere relaxation is all that is v/antecT: whatever gives -eafe, and appcafes the inflammatory lenfion.

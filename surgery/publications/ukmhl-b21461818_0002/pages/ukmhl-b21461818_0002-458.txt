440 A TREATISE afterward, with dexterity or facility: a fmall wound gives as much paiu in the infliaion as a large one; and, as the fcrotum mufl:, firft or laft, be divided nearly to the bottom, it had better be done at firft, on every account. The fpermatic chord, thus laid bare, is to be freed from its furrounding membranous connexions; and then the operator, with his finger and thumb feparating the blood-veffels from the vas deferens, muft pafs a needle, armed with a ligature, between them; and having tied the former only, muft cut through or divide the whole chord, at a quarter or half an inch dif- tance from the faid ligature, according as the ftat'e of the procefs and tefticle will admit. This done; he is then (with the fame knife, with which he has performed the former part of the operation) to diffed the tefticle out from its connexion with the fcrotum: the loofe tex- ture of the dartos, the previous feparation of the tefticle from the fpermatic veiTels, and the help of an aftiftant to hold up the lips of the wound, will enable him todo this with very little pain to the patient, and great faciUty to himfelf This circumflance of cutting off the tefticle, before it be diflefted out from the fcrotum, immediately after the ligature has been^made, is of more confequence to the patient's ca,k, as well as to the facility and expedition of the operation, than the^ who have not tried it are aware of.

ON RUPTURES. 127 It is faid, that by carefully attending to the manner in which a rupture goes up, we may diftinguifh whether the fac returns with it or not; that if it does, including the gut, a hard body will be perceived to pafs under the finger, ^md that the inteftine in its paffage through the abdominal opening, will not make that kind of guggling noife which it is ufually found to do, when the fac does not return with it. This, inflead of being the charac- teriftic mark of the return of the fac, will al- moft always be found to be the cafe when a portion of omentum, which has been much Gompreffed, goes up at the fame time with the gut; and therefore, however ingenious this obfervation may f{?em., confidered theore- tically, it is not to be depended upon in pradtiqc. But fuppofing we had fome clear and un- doubted marks, by which we could always know when this was the cafe, I do not fee how we could'avail ourfelves of them i the intefline mufi be returned before we can have our ijiformation ; and if inftead of the uncer-' tain, delufive reafons jufl: given, we had the cleareft and moft fatisfadory marks of what IS fufpedled, we have no remedy, but a very perplexing.

ON THE HYDROCELE, &c. 34I. The number of people labouring under this difeafe, and who come within the above-men- tioned neceflary reftraints, from age, habit, manner of living, date of the complaint, thicknefs of fac, &c. &c. &c. is great. And that of thofe, who either have an infuperable dread of an operation, or are fo circumftanced or connefted in life, as to make any fuch de- gree of danger highly improper to be volun- tarily incurred, is flill greater: fo that by far the majority of thofe who are affliaed with the diforder, are obliged (however irkfome it may be, or however difagreeable it may prove to them) to carry it through their life, feeking relief now and then from the palhative re- medy of tapping. This renders it, to the ac- tive and to the laborious, a complaint of more confequence than is generally imagined. From thefe confiderations, I have often been induced to think ferioufly on the fubjed, and to make many experiments; the refult of which, when likely to prove at all ufeful to fnankind, or creditable to the art of fur- ator, fpeaking of the cure of the hydrocele by incifion, fays, " This .1 have done, and feen done feveral times, but never " thouglit the cure worth the trouble and pain the patient un- derwent.'' p 2^ 3 gcry,

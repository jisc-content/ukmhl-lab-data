ON RUPTURES, 63 ble, may now and then, by long refl and ab- flinence, become capable of being returned, I am under no doubt, for reafons which have already been mentioned : and not long ago, I had myfelf a patient in St. Bartholomew's holpital, who underwent the operation for the radical cure of a hydrocele, who had alfo an omental hernia, which I and fome others had often tried inefFe6lually to reduce : this during the time of his confinement to bed after the operation, went up of its own accord, and was ever afterwards kept there by a trufs. It fometimes happens in old compound rup- tures, that the piece of ititeftine is reducible, and that of the omentum is not; in which cafe we are told, that the portion of inteftine fhould be kept up by a trufs, whofe pad may be fo made, as not to prefs on the omentum while it reftrains the inteftine. I will not deny that this may now and then be pradlicable, but it is not often fo, and it ought to be particularly attended to, and very carefully watched, left a fmall piece of gut flip down, and being prefled on by the trufs â€¢produce fatal mifchief, I have feen an omental rupture, in which the piece included in the fac had the knotty hardnefs.

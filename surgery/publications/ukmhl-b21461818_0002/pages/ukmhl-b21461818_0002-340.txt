3-^4 A TREATISE methods (cauftic and incifion) will then amount to this; that in the former, the fkin being mortified, the patient is freed from a part of his apprehenlion at its being cut; and the furgeon, fji.ncying that his efcharotic has gone through the vaginal coat, will divide it," as a part of the efchar: but a more careful ex- amination of what he is about, at the time of fuch operation, would generally convince the latter, that he divides the bag unaltered by the cauftic; and the fymptoms which often at- tend this procefs, confirm it. It has indeed been propofed to divide the efchar made in the Ikin, down to the furface of the tunica vaginalis, and then, by the apphcation of a frefh cauftic, to make an efchar in that coat alfo. But whoever makes, or fubmits to this experiment, will find that of two evils he chufes the greater; and to avoid the pain'of incifion, iiicurs a much greater degree of it by the repetition of the efcharotic. The pain attending the firft application of the cauftic, is indeed to fome perfons but httle; but in many it is fully equal to that of the knife, and muft always be of much longer duration: if it does not penetrate the tunica vaginalis, that . bag muft be divided by a cutting inftinament (as

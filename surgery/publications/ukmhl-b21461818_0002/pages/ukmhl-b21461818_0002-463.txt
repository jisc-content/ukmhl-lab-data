ON THE HYDROCELE^ &C. ' have feen three people lofe a very alarming quantity of blood, and one very nearly his life under it; and as in the many times which I have performed this operation, I never faw the leaft inconvenience arife from the ligature^ 1 cannot approve the omiflion of it. Mr. Le Dran himfelf not only feems to be apprehenfive of what may be the confequence, by his paffing a ligature, and leaving it ready to be tied, and by the very good reafon which he gives for not cutting off the Ipermatic chord (as moft of his countrymen advife) elofe to the opening in the tendon of the ob- lique mufcle; but alfo, in the fame para- graph, acknowledges, that a fatal haemorrhage has been the confequence of the ligature hav- ing flipped off, after it has been made^. In f " On demandera, pourquoi je ne fals pas la ligature du " cordon immediatement au deffous de I'anneau, comme les " auteurs le prefcrivent. Jereponds^que filaligature s'echappe, " on ne peut plus lier I'artere qui fe retire au deffus de I'an- neau, ou elle peut donner du fang dans le tiffu cellulaire du peritoine, et faire perir le malade, comme l'o?i a <vu arri'ver," Le Dran. " Si le cordon fpermatique eft gonfle jufqu' aupres de I'an- " neau, on ne peut fuivre cette methode; et il faut abfolument " faire la ligature du cordon, immediatement au deflbus de Â«' I'anneau.'*

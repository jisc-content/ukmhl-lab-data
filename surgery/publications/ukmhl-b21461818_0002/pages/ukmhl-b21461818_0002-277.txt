ON THB HYDROCELE, &c. 263 cumulated, and, by diftending the containing bag, will form the difeafe in queftion. The two preceding fpecies of hydrocele ' have their feat in the tunica communis of the fpermatic veffels; that is, in the cellular membrane which inverts them; one by a ge- neral diffufion of lymph through all its cells ; the other by a colleÂ£lion of it, in one particu- lar cyft or bag: that which makes our pre- fent fubjed has no concern or connexion with that membrane at all, but is abfolutely confined to the tunica vaginalis teftis \ * Fallopius, although, he was unacquainted with the real and true origin and nature of this difeafe, and fuppofed its manner of produdlion to be very unlike what it really is; has yet given a very juft account of the appearance, both of this, and of the former: " Alia vero eft hernia aquofa, in qua aqua diftillat per ** vafa et venas, occulto modo, ac fenfim ad fcrotum. Hsc ' autem eft duplex; alia in qua continetur aqua in membrana " adnata, et in proprio folliculo; alia in qua continetur in *' inguinali tunica qua tejietn 'vejiit. Cognpfcitur aquam efle ^* in tunica adnata, quia feparatur tejlis a parte aquofa manihus\ " praterea, ifta hernia habebit propriam circumfcriptionem, ali- *< quando rotundam, aliquando ovalem. Si autem fit in va- ** ginali, non poffumus amplius arripere & dijii7iguere teflcm ab hernia; quoniam in eodeni loco & aqua, & tcftis fi^nt '* conftittiti." Gab, pAttOFiuJ. S4 It

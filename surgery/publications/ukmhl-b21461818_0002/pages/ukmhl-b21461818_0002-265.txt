ON THE HYDROCELE, SlC. 253 The next day I ordered him a brilk purge, which operated well; and two or three days after, being fatisfied that the inteftinal canal could have no fliare in the complaint, I thruft a lancet into the anterior part of the i^pper tumor; by which means a quantity of limpid ferum was difcharged, and the whole fwell- ing immediately difappeared, leaving the fper- matic veflels free, and eafily diftinguifhable. In a few days he left the hofpital; and at the end of a year, or a little more, he czme to me again, with the lower part of the fcro- tum full, but without any appearance of the tumor above. In fliort, his former ftate con- fided of a complication of the encyfted hydro- cele of the fpermatic chord with that of the tunica vaginaUs teftis; the former was cured by the firft pundlure, the latter was now as full as ever. Confidering the lad's age and temperament, I advifed him to fubmit to the operation for the radical cure by incilion ; which operation was performed, and he got well in about fe- ven weeks, nor has had any return of either complaint fince.

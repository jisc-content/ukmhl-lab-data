S03 ~ A TREATISE On the other hand, I am convinced by fome inftances which I have met M^ith, (and which one time or other I hope to be able to prefent to the pubhc, in a collection with many Others) that th§ opinion has fome foundation in truth, and that perfons labouring under old ruptures, which have been long in the fcrotum without giving any trouble, in which the quantity of inteftine is often very large, the tendinous aperture much dilated, and the hernial fac thick and firm, are thofe to whorn this misfortune h^s happened, and who in- deed, if their cafe be duly confidered, will be found moft liable to it; there being no rea- fon in nature why that part of the inteftine which is contained in fuch a hernia, ftiould not be fubje£t to every complaint, or difeafe, to which every other part of that canal is in the inteftine, and that the ftrifture made by the tendon is not a primary caufe, but an efFeft of the diieafe, I do not fee how we can avoid propofmg the operation; for whether the increafed fize of the gut be owing to the inflammation, which renders it too large to pafs the abdominal opening, or whether \t be the mere efFeft of ftrifture made by the tendon, in either cafe it will bind equally, and the event muft be .exaftly th^, lame, as far at leaft as the ftrifture has to do with it: for when the inteftine is inflamed, whether fuch inflammation preceded or fucceeded the confinement of it by the tendinous opening, ^he fymptoms can never be appeafed, but by the releafe of the, gut from its confinement. • ^' ' ■ ■ liable :

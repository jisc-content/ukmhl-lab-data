i62 A TREATISE fore, and a brilk fymptomatic fever mull be expedted, which m fome habits miift be pro- du6live of coiiiiderable mifchief: and that con- fiderable mifchief was often done by thefe procefles, may be learned from the very writers who defcribe them*. If the OS pubis be laid bare, whether by cau- tery' or by cauftic, fome of the before-men- ' Guido fpeaking of the cure by cauftic fays," In quo fumme cavendum eft, quod dominus fit de corrofivo; fi enim indofte " applicatur, febrim commovet, & accidentia mala." That great pain, defluxion on the haemorrhoidal veflels, and inflam- mation and fwelling of the fcrotum, were often the confequencc of thefe attempts, may be learned from the fame author, who, fpeaking of the method of applying the cauftic, fays, " Et ita *' continue fiat quoufque care miracis tota lit corrupta, ufquc " ad Didymum, quod cognofcitur per inflationem burfae, & " tefticaloram." And that the cauftic has gone deep enough, he gives the following proof: " Quod cognofcetur per majorera " tumoremtefticuli&permajoremdoloremdorfi&partiumpoile- " riorum." Brunus fays, " Et cave fumma diligentia, ne inhora " cauterizationis exeat inteftinum, et comburatur." Lanfranc, fpeaking of the ill efFeft of the cauftic in fomehabits, fays, " Et " fic multi fpafmantur, & fpafmati fubito moriuntur." Fab. ab Aquapendente fays, " Qus tamen chirurgiffi uti videtis, diffi- " ciles admodum funt, & inter fubtiliflimas haberi poffunt; quo fit " ut plerique patientes affeftus perpetuo geftare quamhis chU *' rurgis fubmittere fe vellent." And in another place, " ■Quae " porro chirurgise vehementem dolorem afferunt & fatis diffici- " ^es funt." In fhort,whoever will take the trouble of reading the old writers on this fubjeft will, even from their own account, be fatisfied,both of the pain, hazard, and ineflicacy of aU thefe methods. • tioned

ON THE HYDROCELE, &C, 275 ment: I mean the true limple hydrocele, in which the tefticle is foft, and found, (only perhaps a little more lax, and larger than or- dinary,) and the hydro-farcocele, in which the teftis is not only enlarged, but hardened, and not in a found, or healthy ftate: the for- mer of thefe will permit fuch treatment with perfed fafety, but in the other, may bring the patient into a ftate both of pain and hazard % It may indeed, and does fometimes become neceffary to let out the water from the vagi- nal coat of a tefticle, in fome degree difeafed; but this fhould always be done with caution, and under a guarded prognoftic; left the pa- tient be not only difappoiiited, by not having that permanent relief, which for want of bet- ter information he may be induced to expect:; but be alfo (poffibly) fubje6:ed to other uaex- peÂ£led inconveniences from the attempt. * Some inftances of this are related iii this traft. Hildanas has given a particular account of a miftake of this kind: " Tncifo fcroto piurimum affluxit aquas, hinc prlmo fubfedit fcrotiim ; poll paacos tamen dies fecutus eft dolor, vehemens ii|flam- " matio & cancrofum ulcus, maximeque malignum ; quod adco impetuofe adjacentes partes occupavit, ut iplius maJignitas ** nuUo modo arceri poSit; fed intra paucos dies maximo cum *' cruciatu e vita deceflit." ,Fab.

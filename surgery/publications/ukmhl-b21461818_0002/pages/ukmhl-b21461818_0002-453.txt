ON THE HYDROCELE, &C. 435 we cannot be too attentive in examining the precife nature of each individual cafe, and in' embracing every opportunity of giving him that relief, which it may at one time be in our power to give, and which, the lucky op^ portunity miffed, it may never be in his power again to receive. The other circumftance which I have men- tioned as capable of deceiving an operator, and inducing him to beheve that the Ipermatic chord is much more difeafed than it really is^ and thereby deterring him from the perform- ance- of an operation which might prove fuc- cefsful, is the extravafation, or CoUedion of fluid in the Cellular membrane enveloping the fpermatic veffels, between the abdominal open- ing and the teftis. In the cellular membrane leading to a dif- eafed tefticle, it is no very uncommon thing to find colledions of extravafated fluid. Thefe, as they add confiderably to the bulk, and ap- parent fize, of the procefs, make the com- plaint appear more terrible 5 and, as I have juft faid, lefs likely to admit relief. When this extravafation is sreneral throuo-h all the cells of the invefting membrane, and the fpermatic vefiels themfelves are hardened, F f 2 knotty,

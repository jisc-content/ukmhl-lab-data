42C> A treatise: fize, are hy foime people looked on as fuch marks of a malignant difpofition, that they have lias often cured the prefent evil; and that the patient has re- mained free from any thing of like fort, during his or her life. This.is true, and therefore is and ever will be afufficient reafon forpreffing fuch operation, when all other circumftances are favourable : that the patient may keep well after it, is by no means improbable j that the fcirrhus would remain, through life, indolent and inofFenfive, is very improbable. But whoever boldly alTerts, that fuch extirpation will always and certainly cure the difeafe, is very inexperienced, or is wilfully guilty of a deception, (the two diftinguifhing marks of a quack, who always promifes, what he either does not know, or does not believe.) When a fcirrhus or cancer is favourably circumllanced, and fo fituated as that it may be extirpated, fuch extirpation is indeed the only remedy; and that method by which fuch ex- tirpation can be moft certainly and expeditioufly executed, is, beyond all doubt, the beft. The two in ufe are, the knife arid the cauftic. The former, in the hand of a furgeon who is an anatomifl, has every advan- tage which can be delired or fuppofed: it gives lefs pain, is more fecure and more expeditious; but it imprefTes on the patient the apprehenfion of an operation, and the fear of an haemorrhage. The ufe of cauftic is infinitely more painful, not only in immediate fenfation, but in duration: it often re- quires repetition : it is lefs manageable, lefs fecure} and tlie great length of time which fometimes the Reparation of the mortified parts takes up, renders it very tedious. But it is attended with two circumftances, which have greatly contri- buted to the fupport of cancer quackery : one is, that it fpares the patient the horror of an operation, which, diough infi- nitely lefs painful than the efFedl of the cauftic, is not believed to

A TREATISE This idea is not only erroneous, and con- trary to faa, but may be produdive of very mifchievous confequences in pradice. For from fuch conception (or rather mifconcep- tion) of the ftate and difpofition of the parts, it may be inferred, that all points of the tu- mor are equally fit for fuch operation as may become neceflary for the difcharge of the fluid I which is fo far from being the cafe, that in fome parts of it, fuch operation is per- fedlly fafe, eafy, and harmlefs ; in other it is hazardous, painful, and may be produdlive of the moft dreadful confequences. Whoever will take the pains to examine the ftrudure and difpofition of the two coats of the tefticle, the albuginea and vaginalis, will find, that in one part they are fo infeparably united, (being indeed one and the fame membrane) that it is impoflible for any thing to infinuate itfelf be- tween them : while in every other part they are fo abfolutely unconneded, that from the great dilatability of the latter, a large quantity of fluid may be accumulated \ In " Humor magna ex parte, in tunica Erythroide appellata, tefticulum ambiente, in partem anttrlorem colligiturj c^ZLpatiffi- vmm membrana ilia a tejiiculo/eparatur.'^ PaULVS iEciKETA, Mr,

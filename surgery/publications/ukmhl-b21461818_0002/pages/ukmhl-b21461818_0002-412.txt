394 A 'TREATISE The hernia humoralis is a defluxion of the inflammatory kind, proceeding moft frequently from an irritation'in that part of the urethra, â– where the vafa deferentia, or veficulae femi- nales terminate, it is attended with pain and heat, and moft frequently fever: during the firft, or inflamed ftate of the difeafe, the whole compages of the tefticle is enlarged; but when by reft, evacuation, and proper applications, that inflammation is calmed, there feldom or never remains, either fulnefs, hardnefs, or any other mark of difeafe in the glandular part of the teftis. The epididymis indeed feldom efcapes fo well; that often continues enlarged and indurated for a conliderable fpace of time, but without producing either pain or incon-. venience; and without occafioning any alter- ation in the figure or ftrufture of what is called the body of the tefticle; whereas the true farcocele, or hernia carnofa, moft com- monlybegins by an indolent induration of that part of the teftis, and afFedls the epididy- mis fecondarily; or after it has already fpoiled the vafcular part of the gland. I would not be underftood to mean, that a farcocele never follows a hernia humoralis J ^ I fay moll commonly, becaufe it is neither neccffarily, nor always. there

43^ A TREATISE knotty, and difeafed, the cafe is without re- medy; for ahhough a punfture, or an in- cifion, will undoubtedly give difcharge to fome, or even the greateft part of the fluid; yet this extravafation is fo fmall, and fo infig- nificant a circumftance of the difeafe, and the parts in this ftate are fo little capable of bear- ing irritation, that an attempt of this kind mull: be ineffed;ual, and may prove mif- chievous. But on the other hand, collections of water are fometimes made in the fame membrane, from an obftru6lion to the proper circulation through the numerous lymphatics in the fper-^ matic procefs, while the velTels themfelves are really not difeafed, and therefore very capable of permitting the operation. In this cafe, the fluid is generally in one cyft, or bag, like tÂ© an encyfted hydrocele, and the fpermatic chord, cyft and all, are eafily moveable from fide to fide; contrary to the preceding ftate, in which the o-eneral load in the membrane fixes the whole procefs, and renders it almoft immoveable. A difcharge of the fluid will, in this cafe, enable the operator to examine the true ftate of thQ procefs, and, as I have twice or thrice feen,

A TREATISE water gradually; and to continue fuch a drain from the parts where it had been colleded, as ** ernes, the operation of which he could not Imme^ately ** Hop, or any fingle mechanical eiFort, the efFedl of which he " could not be fure of> are not to be employed. " Suppofe the cannula of the trocar was to be left in; by *' the extremity of it rubbing againft the tefticle, an inflamma- *' tion might be artfully raifed; the caufe of which might be ** taken away as foon as the furgeon thought fit," &c. Medical Essays. This method, with fome fmall alteration, I have once or twice ufed with fuccefs. Being afraid of the pain which might be caufed by the extremity of the cannula rubbing againft the tu- nica albuginea, and the irritation in confequence thereof, I have left it in, but with a piece of bougie (whofe length exceeded that of the qannula about, a quarter or an eighth of an inch) within it. Of all the methods of ufmg a tent, I think this is the beft, as the cannula fecures its paffage into- the cavity of the vaginal coat; which the collapfing of that tunic, and the 'loofe texture of the dartos, would otlierwife render fomewhat difficult. But although I have once or twice fucceeded in this manner, I have much oftener been fruftrated: fometimes it .has proved abfolutely ineffeftual; and at others, I have feen it raife fuch a difturbance, as to render it neceffary to lay the whole cavity open before a cure could be obtained. Of all the methods of obtaining a radical cure of an hydro- cele, by exciting inflammation within the turiica vaginalis, and thereby obtaining an adhefion between it and the albuginea, that by the feton is by much the beft; it is the leaft painful, the moft eaftly managed, excites the leaft troublefome fymptoms, and is the moft frequently fuccefsful; but, as I fhall have occa- fion to fpeak of this hereafter, I fliall defer faj-ing any more cojicerning it in this place. I might

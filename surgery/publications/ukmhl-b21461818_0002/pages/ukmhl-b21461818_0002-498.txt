J^'^O ' A TREATISE and petfed fcirrhus in my life. The epMi- dymis was thrice the lize it ought to have been ; its external furface was very unequal, and very hard ; and in the centre of it was a putrid flough, with a fmall quantity of matter^ juft as it is found very often in the middle of a fcirrhous and cancerous tefticle* . The tefticle was hardly, if at all, altered from a natural ftate, except that the tunica vaginalis was ge- nerally adherent to the albughiea. Its inter- nal texture was foft, and bore very little mark of diftemper. I have, at this inflant, a lad in St. Bartho- lomew's hofpital, both whofe tefticles are fo truly difeafed, that they mufl of neceffity be removed. I have feen him from the firfk of the attack. The difeafe for feveral months occupied only the epididymis; and had no connexion with, or dependence on, any vene- real mifchief. Every thing that the art of furgery could do (or at leaft every thing that I am acquainted with in it) has been tried, but without any efteft ; and nothing but the oper- ation can fave him. , . CASE

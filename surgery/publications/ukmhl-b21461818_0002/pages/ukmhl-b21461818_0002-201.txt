ON THE HYDROCELE, &C. 1 7 veffels. are covered b^, and enveloped in, that expan- fion of mufcular fibres, called the cremafter. The membrane furrounding all that part of the fpermatic veffels, which is on the outfide of the abdomen, is called the tunica commu- nis, or tunica vaginalis of the chord ; and is (as has already been faid) merely cellular; totally void of all other cavity than its cells; firmly adherent to the furface of the faid ance, and what every praditioner ought to be well acquainted with. The common doftrine is, that in each of the oblique mufcles and in the tranfverfalis is a tendinous aperture, for the tranfit of the fpermatic chord; and thefe fuppofed openings are called the rings. This is a miftake, which even fome very modern writers in anatomy have fallen into: and left their words Ihould not convey an idea fufficiently erroneous, fome of them have given us drawings of all thefe openings in regular gradations, above and behind each other. Nothing can be more falfe than fuch reprefentation: the fpermatic veffels do never pafs tbrought but always under the tranfverfalis and obllquus internus, at fuch diftance as never to be affefted by their aftlon, or to fulFer any ftrifture or ftrangulation from them. On the contrary, the fpermatic chord always paffes through an opening made for that purpofe in the tendon of the obliquus extemus; the aflion of which it is liable to be afFedted by; and when it is accom- panied by a portion of inteftine (as in the cafe of an hernia) it is this tendinous aperture which produces the ftriflure, the fymptoms, and the hazard. A circumftance of great confe- quence for every man to know, who may ever be called upon to operate oa a ftrangulated hernia.

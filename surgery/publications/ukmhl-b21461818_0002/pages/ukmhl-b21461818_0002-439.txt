ON THE HYDROCELE, &C. 421 have been by them reckoned as difliiafives from the operation. B\it to be fo: the other is, that the ragged appearance, which the' bottom and fides of the parts make after having been removed by fuch application, is fo unlike to the fmoothnefs of that which has been removed by incifion, that ignorant people are eafily induced to believe, what the defigning always tell them, viz. that the medicine has taken their difeafe out by the roots; and that the ragged parts, which they fee, are fuch roots. It is amazing what weight this fingle circumftance has wltH many, and even with fome fenfible people; few of whom are perfuaded to believe what is as true as any propofition in Eu- clid, viz. that a cauftic of equal ftrength, applied on any glandular part of any perfon, will always produce exaftly the fame eiTedt and appearance as, in this cafe, palfes with them for the roots or branches of the difeafe. When nurfes and quacks talk of the fibrous roots of a canr cer, and of cancerous fermentations, they are. excufable; the one from their ignorance, the other from the ijature of their trade; but when they who pretend to fome kind of medical knowledge ufe this kind of language, it is lhameful. If either the fears of the patient, or the particular circum- ftances of the part to be removed, render the ufe of cauftic preferable, or nece^^ary, every praditioner is well acquainted with thofe which are perfectly efhcacious; but every pradli- tioner alfo knows, that good reafons for preferring the ufe of them to the knife very feldom occur: it is in this a? in the at- tempts toward' a radical cure for ruptures, and fome other parts of furgery, we are cenfured where we ought to be ap- plauded, and blamed for thofe very things from whence we ought to derive praife. We have laid afide certain methods and procefTes, becaufe we found them (upon experience) to be painful, liazardous, and inefFeftual: and thefe very me- E e 3 ' thods.

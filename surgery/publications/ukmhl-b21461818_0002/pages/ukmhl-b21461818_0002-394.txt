J7^ A TREATISE From the feel of all the lower part, I made no doubt that the tumor contained a confider' able quantity of fluid; and had there been no other circumftance to influence my judg- ment, I fhould have fuppofed the difeafe to have been a hydrocele of the tunica vaginalis teftis; but the very diftindl and particular ac- count which the man gave of himfelf, and the feel and the appearance of the fpermatic procefs, made me hefltate. Whatever might be the true nature of the cafe, a fluid there certainly was ; and that in quantity fufficient to render the difcharge of it both fafe and warrantable. I made a punc- ture in the middle and anterior part, and let out above a pint of brown ferum. This dif- charge removed all the fweliing fromhelow; but made little or no alteration, either in the look or the feel of the upper part of the pro- cefs, I endeavoured to reduce it; but found it impraaicable, and defifted; advifing ti>e â€¢jnan to let it alone, to wear no bandage of ^ any kind; and if at any future time it be- came troublefonie to him, 1 defired that I might fee it, a-In about a year's time, he came to me again, with his fcrotum as big as before, and palpably contai^iing a fluid.

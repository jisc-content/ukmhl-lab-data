The tumor was large, of an oblong figure, began juft below the exit of the fpermatic veffels from the belly, and extended to the bottom of the fcrotum; but in the middle of it was a depr-eflion, or ftridure, which feemed to divide it nearly into two equal parts. The Tipper part was fo high, that I could not feel the fpermatic procefs at all fatisfa6lorily; aiid although there was palpably a fluid in the whole of the fwelling, yet the upper and lower parts of it did not feeria to communi- cate with each other; at leaft the fludluation ■through them was not difceruible.

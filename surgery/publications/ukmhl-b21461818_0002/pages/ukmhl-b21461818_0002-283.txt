ON THE HYDROCELE, &C. 269 In a hydrocele which is tolerably full, the place of this union is the pofterior and fupe- rior, or rather the pofterior and middle part of the tumor. A pundlure or incifion made here, cannot only do no fervice, as it cannot reach the water, and therefore cannot anfwer the intention for which it ought to be made; but muft injure the tefticle, or its epididymis, , and thereby do great mifchief; whereas an opening made in every other part, will not only give difcharge to the water, but can do no harm, and is free from all kind of danger. This natural connexion between the two ■tunics, at the upper and hinder part, is the reafon why, in a fimple hydrocele, that part of the tumor feels fo very unlike to every other. In that, the tunica albuginea, and vaginalis, being immediately continuous, no water can get between them ; and therefore, the fingers of an intelligent examiner muft Mr. Le Dran, whcfe charafter in praftlcal furgery ftands defervedly high, feems to be lefs clear in his idea, and lefs perfpicuous in his account of this difeafe, than of moft others - his account is, " Une vefT.e aqueufe placee fur I'un de tefli- " cules.auquelelleeiladherente; & comme elle devient quel- «' qucfois tres groffe. elle remplit prefque tout le fcrotum." Thi. does not (at leaft to me) convey an idea that the feat ot this difeafe is within the tunica vaginalis teftis. immediately

When the piece of caul is engaged in fuch a degree of ftridure as to prevent the circulation of blood through it, it will fometimes, by becoming gangrepous, be the oCcafion of very bad fymptoms, and even of death, as I have more than once feen : and thus, as a mere omental hernia, it may fome= times be fubjea to great hazard.

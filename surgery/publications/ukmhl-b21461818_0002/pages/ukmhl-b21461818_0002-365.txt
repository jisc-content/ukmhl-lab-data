ON THE HYDROCELE, &C. 349 times, without having been wounded, burft. If the quantity of blood fhed from the veffel fo bur ft be fmall, it is foon abforbed again, and, creating no trouble, the thing is not known But if the quantity be confiderable, it, like the preceding, occafions a new tumor, and calls for a repetition of the operation. This I call the fecond fpecies : which, like the firft, belongs entirely to the vaginal coat, and has no concern either with the tefticle, or with the fpermatic veffels. In both, the bag which was full of water, becomes in a Ihort fpace of time diftended with blood; which blood, if not carried off by abforption, muft be difcharged by opening the containing cyft: but in neither of thefe can caftration (though faid to be the only remedy) be ever * From this caufe it very often happens, that the laft run- ning (if I may ufe the phrafe) of the water'from an hydrocele, is bloody (all the former part having been perfedlly clear); and from hence it is, that a bloody difcharge may almoft al- ways be produced upon the fame occafion, by preffing and handling the fcrotum. They, who would fee a very ingenious account of this kind of hxmatocele, and a very probable appli- cation of the fame principle, for the folution of fome other ap- pearances in difcafes, may find it in the Edinburgh ElTays from profeffor Monro, the father. neceffarv: â€¢J

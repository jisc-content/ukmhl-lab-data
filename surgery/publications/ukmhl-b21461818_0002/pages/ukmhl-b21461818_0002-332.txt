3^^ A TREATISE 7 « relinquo feton, the tent, and the cannula, though ufed for another purpofe, or at leafl for other rea- fons, were found to be followed by it fo often, that they foon were ranked among the means for obtaining a radical cure ^ They accounts given by Brunus and Theodoric, are the fame as that of all the writers befoi'e them, and have been copied by many fiflce : *' Curatio ejus eft, ut incidatur cutis tefticulorum feftione *' ampla fecundum longitudinem ejus; dein perfora, et aquam extrahe." Many of the old writers* have left us direflions for palling the feton, and for introducing the tent, either of lint or fponge, and the cannula, either of alder, or of filver, Gulielmus e Saliceto, having firft propofed the ufe of exter- nal applications, fays, " Si hac via non confumitur aqua, tunc perfora burfam, cum phlebotomo tuo acuto, Sc extrahe aquam, non fubito totam, fed partem; & pone in foramina *' illo tentam lineam, vel lluppeam, aut fpongiam; ut poffes *' de die in diem aquam extrahere: & nota, quod hujufmodi " asgritudo multoties recidivat; & fi fic, femper redeas ad *' perforationem antedidtam: & via ifta, et modo, perfedle *• curabitur." Fabritius ab Aquapendente fpeaks of the tent as frequently ufed by him in the mixed cafe of hydrocele and farcocele, or difeafed tefticle; though by the account he gives of his fuc- cefs it is pretty clear that he ufed it in the hydrocele only, o^ when the tefticle was not really difeafed. His words are, " Si ** camofa firaul & aquofa fit hernia, ego talem adhibeo curam. Seco cutem, & incifionem facio exiguam, & in loco po- " tius altiqri, quam in fundo; inde, turunda Impofita cum *' digeftivo, & pus movcnte medicamento procedo, neque, un- " quam totum pus extraho, fed perpetuo bonam partem intus

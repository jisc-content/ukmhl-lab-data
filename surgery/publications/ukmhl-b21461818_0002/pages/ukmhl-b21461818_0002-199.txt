Thefe vary in their number, in dif- ferent fubje6ls, being frorn ten to' fifteen, more or lefs: when colleÂ£led together they form the globus major, or larger extremity of that body, which, from its fituation, is called epididymis j after this, they unite into one fnigle tube, which being convoluted and con- torted, in the moft miraculous manner, con- ffitutes the reft of that fame body: fo that the "whole of the epididymis, except that imme- diate point which is formed by the concur- rence of the vafa efferentia, does really confift of one fingle tube, whofe diameter is faid, iti no part, to exceed the eightieth of an iiich, but which is contorted fome thoufands of times; and if unravelled, and drawn out, is. fpme yards in length. From the leiTer ex- tremity of the epididymis proceeds the vas deferens, or that tube through which the fe- men is conveyed from the teftis toward the penis; or, in other words, when this wonder- ful tube ceafes to be convoluted, and puts on the appearance of one fingle, fmooth velTel, it is then called vAs deferens.

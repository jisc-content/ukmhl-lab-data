Thefe openings are of an oval figure, and have an obUque diredion from above downward; the upper part of them is rather wider than the lower, and they are of larger, fize in men than in women.** The tendinous fibres of this 1,-nufcle, as they proceed from its flefhy part obhquely down- ward, have.feveral fmall apertures for the paf- fage of veflels and nerves; and at their infer- tion into the os pubis, they crofs one another, and are as it were interwoven, by which means their infertion is ftrengthened, and their attachment made firmer. .

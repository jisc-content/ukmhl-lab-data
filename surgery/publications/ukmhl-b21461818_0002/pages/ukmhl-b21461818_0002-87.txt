ON RUPTURES. ^jj it to, they iliould never be fufFered to remaia down, if they are reducible; and that not only on thig account^ but alfo becaufe they render the patient always liable to the defcent of a piece of gut, In geueral they are more eafy of reduÂ£lion than the inteftinal, and be^ ing not painful will admit of more free hand- ling, as well as more time to be fpent in the attempt*^. I have already mentioned the reafons why an omental rupture is fometimes incapable of being reduced, viz. adhefiori to the fides of the hernial fac, or fuch an alteration in the form of it, as makes it impoffible for it to pafs through the abdominal aperture. When this is truly the cafe, as is moft reafonable to fup-.- pofe when it refifts all proper attempts, there is no remedy but to fufpend the weight of it in a bag-trufs, and thereby render it as little troublelbme as poffible. Tliis is indeed all that can be done when the rupture is abfo- Kitely irreducible ; but in books will be found directions to leave an old omental hernia down, and fufpend it in a bao-, even thouo-h ^ Writers of good credit have given accounts of the worft fymptoms from a mere epiplocele ; in Dionis may be feen a cafe of this kind, in Garengeot, and others.

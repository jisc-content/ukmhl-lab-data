g TREATISE SECT. VII. Hydrocele of the tunica vaginalis TESTIS. The third fpecles of this difeafe, is that which is confined to the vaginal coat, or bag which loofely envelopes^ the tefticle. In the Ihort anatomical account already given of the produdlion, ftrudure, and fituation of this tunic, it has been obferved, that in a natural, healthy ftate, its cavity always contains a fmall quantity of a fine fluid, exhaled from capillary arteries, and conftantly abforbed by veffels appointed for that purpofe. This fluid, in the natural fmall quantity ferves to keep the tunica albuginea moift, and to prevent a cohefion between it and the va- ginalis ; a confequence, which almofl necef- farily follows any fuch difeafed ftate of thefe parts, as prevents the due fecretion of it. On the contrary, if the quantity depofited be too large, or if the regular abforption of it be by any means prevented, it will be gradually ac- cumulated.

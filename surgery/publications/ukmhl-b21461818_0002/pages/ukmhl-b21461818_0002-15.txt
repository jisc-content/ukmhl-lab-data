TO TREATISE ON RUPTITRES. 5 who is beft acquainted witli them will be the beft fur- geon, is well known to every one who is at all converfant Wit^ them, and can be denied only by thofe who are not. But, on the other hand, it muft alfo be allowed, that both their theory and their practice laboured under great difad- vantages, which rendered their judgment of many difeafes erroneous, and their treatment of them irrational and unfuc- cefsful. The very imperfeft ftate of their anatomy was one great fource of error; which kind of knowledge has been fo cul- tivated in our times as to convert ignorance into a vice, and to render thofe who are deficient in it perfectly inex- cufable. As this is the only true and folid bafis from which all cHT- rurgical knowledge muft for ever fpring, fo it has of late years been produÂ£tive of many real and great improvements in the art. The ancient furgery was coarfe, and loaded with a far- rago of external applications, fome of which were horridly, and yet unneceiTarily painful, and others altogether ufelefs ; whilft the operative part of the art was encumbered with a multitude of aukward unmanageable inftruments, and pieces of machinery. The pradlitioners of the prefent time have brought the pradtice into a much narrower compafs, have rendered it lefs painful and more intelligible; they have reduced the number of inftruments, and by the extreme fimplicity of thofe which they now ufe, they have confiderably aflifted the dexterity of an operator, and fhortened the time of an operation ; they have almoft thrown afide the burning cau- tery, and are much more fparing in the ufe of cauftic appli- cations than their predeceflbrs ufed to be; they now accom- plifti many cures by mild and gentle-means, which formerly B ^ were

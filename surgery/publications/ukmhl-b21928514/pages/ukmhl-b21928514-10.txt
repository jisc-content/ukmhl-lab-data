10 who has served much in the field and in various climates. At the end of the last war, upwards of 300 medical officers of the Army were placed on half-pay, and it is within my knowledge that many of them profited greatly by attendance on this class before they returned to employment on full pay.‚Äù As the opinions of the heads of the Medical Departments of the Army and Navy are easily accessible to the Committee, I forbear troubling you with farther details, and will only state, that by .a recent intimation, the Director-General has enjoined attendance upon the class of Military Surgery, on those young gentlemen educating at this University for the Medical Department of the Army ; that the Physician of the Navy has given to candidates for his Department the option of attending this class in lieu of part of the surgical attend- ance required of them ; and that the Royal College of Sur- geons of Edinburgh had previously given the same option to candidates for their Diploma. Under these circumstances, I would most humbly submit to the Committee the propriety of giving a similar option to all students educating for the general practice of the profes- sion, and also of establishing similar courses of instruction in the other great schools of medicine. By icliich it appears to me that the public may be materially benefited in two ways; in the first place, by giving to the Army and Navy Surgeons facilities and encouragement to preserve, to record, and to make known the results of that valuable experience which in the course of service they necessarily acquire; and in the second place, by having always at command a body of professional men, who, without prejudice to their qualifications as general practitioners, may be more particularly instructed in the duties devolving upon medical officers in the public service, and thus competent to act upon every emergency. I have the honour to be, Sir, your most obedient humble servant, GEO. BALLING ALL, M.D. JRegius Professor of Military Surgery. Edinburgh College, 2bth Feb. 1834,

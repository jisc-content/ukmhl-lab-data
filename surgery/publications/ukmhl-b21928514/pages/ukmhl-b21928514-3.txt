TO T1IE CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE OF THE MEDICAL AND SURGICAL FROFESSORS OF THE UNIVERSITY, AND OF THE ROYAL COLLEGES OF PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS OF EDINBURGH, ON MEDICAL EDUCATION, &c. Slit, Perceiving from the observations of some of the public bodies to whom the Provisional Resolutions of your Committee were submitted, that the nature, objects, and peculiar position of the Class of Military Surgery in this University, are still imperfectly under- stood, I have thought it right to reprint, with an addi- tional appendix, the Letter which I had the honour to address to Mr. Warburton in 1834. This I am induced to do from a sense of duty to the Chair I fill, to the Committee who framed the above-mentioned resolu- tions, to the several bodies by whom they have been finally adopted, and, above all, to the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, by whose regulations candi- dates for their diploma, have for many years past, had the option of taking a course of Military Surgery in place of a second course of the Principles and Practice of Sunrerv.

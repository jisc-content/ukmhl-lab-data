19 surgery. Cooper’s Surgical Dictionary, Hennen’s Military Surgery, Guthrie on Gun-Shot Wounds, and Hutchison’s Naval Surgery de- servedly rank as works of authority and reference. In the produc- tion before us, the author has analyzed the labours of his predeces- sors,—he has laid all under contribution. lie has collected and arranged the whole of the established facts,—he has added the re- sults of his own experience, and executed a system of military and naval surgery of inestimable value to those engaged in the practice of that branch of the healing art. ****** “ Some persons assert, that there is no difference between Civil and Military Surgery; and this must be granted so far as operations are concerned; but there is a vast deal of important information contained in the latter which is not in the former. In the works on surgery, there is no allusion to the examination of recruits, the diet, clothing, and exercise of troops, their accommodation in camp, barracks, and billets, diseases in camps, garrisons, and hospitals, transportation of the sick and wounded, diseases of troops on foreign stations, punishments, feigned and fictitious diseases, medicine chests, surgical instruments, &c. &c. The medical directors of the army and navy boards have therefore very properly recognised one course of Military Surgery as a part of the course of education of surgeons for the services over which they preside. It is a remark- able fact, that there is no Professor of Military Surgery in the nu- merous medical schools of London or Dublin.”—London Medical and Surgical Journal for October 1833.

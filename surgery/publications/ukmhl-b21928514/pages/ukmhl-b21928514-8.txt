a ests of the professor of Military Surgery, or on the in, terests of other professors, which has been imagined. But it is not, I apprehend, as it bears on the interests of any professor, or even on the interests of the students, but as it bears on the interests of the public, that this matter ought to be regulated, and I would therefore solicit particular attention to the concluding paragraph of my letter to Mr. Warburton, printed in italics. From the number of important cases and communi- cations, of which I have been made the depositary, I feel assured that much valuable information is annually lost to the public, from there not being, in each of the Metropolitan schools, at least one professor or lecturer, whose attention is specially directed to the topics em- braced in the course of Military Surgery, and to whom gentlemen, returning from foreign stations, might free- ly communicate their observations. I feel equally as- sured, and the officers of the Army will concur with me in the opinion, that the troops, when detached in small parties over the country, apart from their own surgeons, would meet with more prompt and efficient treatment, were country practitioners more generally instructed as to the habits and diseases of soldiers, and the duties devolving on army surgeons. I remain, Sir, Your most obedient servant, GEO. BALLINGALL, M.D. Regius Professor of Military Surgery. Edinburh College, 30 ih March 1839.

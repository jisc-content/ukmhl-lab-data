David Boyd, Esq., Surgeon in the Honourable East India Com- pany’s Service. George Baillie, Esq., Surgeon in the Honourable East India Company’s Service. OPINION given by several Medical Officers of the Honourable East India Company's Army relative to the Lectures on Military Surgery delivered in the University of Edinburgh in 1827. We, the undersigned Medical Officers of the Honourable East India Company’s Service, do most willingly express our opinion of the great utility of the Lectures on Military Surgery delivered in the University of Edinburgh to those young men educating with a view to our service. Some of us, who have now retired from that ser- vice, have to regret that no similar source of instruction existed at the period when we were educated; and others of us, who are about returning to India, have eagerly embraced the opportunity afforded us by Dr. Ballingall, of profiting by his experience in the treatment of the diseases incident to European troops in India.

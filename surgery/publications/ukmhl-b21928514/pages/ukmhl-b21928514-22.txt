22 No. III. EXTRACT from the Evidence fgiven by Sir G. Ballingall, before the Royal Commissioners for Visiting the Universities of Scotland. Q. "Would you wish, to see introduced into this University, a separate Professor of Surgery, apart from the Professor of Anatomy ? A. I think it would be beneficial to the school.

I am further induced, in justice to the chair which I have the honour to fill, to submit the foregoing remarks to the Royal Com- missioners, because I know that some of my colleagues are of opinion, that it would be for the interests of the Medical School that a Pro- fessorship of Surgery should be instituted in this University, apart from the Anatomical Chair; and that this might be done by con- verting the Professorship of Military Surgery into a chair of General Surgery. Now, whatever may be my sentiments as to the expedi- ency of instituting a Professorship of general Surgery in the Univer- sity, and they are certainly favourable to such an institution, I am at the same time decidedly of opinion that such a Professorship should not be formed by sacrificing the chair of Military Surgery,â€”

APPENDIX. QUERIES addressed to Henry Marshall, Esq., Deputy Inspec- tor General of Army Hospitals, and to Dr. Badenach, Surgeon to the Forces, by Sir George Ballingall, Professor of Military Surgery in the University of Edinburgh. 1. Q. Are you acquainted Avitli the nature and objects of the course of lectures which is annually delivered upon Military Surgery in the University of Edinburgh ? A. We are acquainted with the nature and objects of this course of lectures as annually delivered in the University of Edinburgh, hav- ing not only attended the lectures of the Professor, but perused the volume he has lately published, entitled, “ Outlines of the Course,” &c. 2. Q. What is your opinion in regard to the utility of a course of lectures on Military Surgery to young gentlemen intended for the medical department of the Army, the Navy, and the East India Com- pany’s service ? A. We have a very high opinion of the utility of a course of lec- tures of this kind. A student who has attended a course of lectures on Military Hygiene and Military Medicine is prepared to avail him- self with great benefit of the practical advantages of experience, by which means he will be much sooner able to assume in an efficient manner the medical charge of a body of men, than if he had not re- ceived such instructions. 3. Q. What is your opinion respecting the plan of the course of lectures in question, and can you suggest any means by which it may be improved ? On this latter subject state your sentiments candidly

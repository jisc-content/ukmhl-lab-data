560 Explanation of the Elates. Plate power than when of the ufual form, This part of the inftrument fliould not only be well polilhed, but thickly co- vered with feveral plies of foft old li- nen, in order to render the prelliire pro- duced by it upon the gums as eafy as pof- lible. The handle D is fometimes made of Iron; but it anfwers better either of ivory or timber. Fig. 3. A claw bent in fuch a manner, that when the heel of the inftrument C is placed upon any part of the gums, the fe- cond or third tooth farther in the mouth may be pulled with it. This provesTome- times ufeful, where the gums oppofite to the alTected tooth are particularly tender; and it fliould always be employed v^hen it is meant to pull either of the two fartheft rnoiares of the lower jaw outwards; for iu uling the common inftrument for thefe teeth, the gums that cover the projedting part of the coronoid procefs of the jaw are always much lacerated. Figs. 4. and 5. Two claws of differenr fizes of the ordinary form.

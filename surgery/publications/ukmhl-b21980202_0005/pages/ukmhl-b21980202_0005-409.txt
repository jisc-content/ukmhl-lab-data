Se£l, II. On the Hydrocele^ 401 I have already obferved, that, although the anarfarcous hydrocele, for the moft part, depends upon a general tendency to dropfy, that fome inftances, however, occur, of a local caufe producing a mere local dropfy of the ferotum. ‘ Thus it has, in fome inftances, arifen from tumors in the groin and abdomen obftru<fting the paflage of the lymphatics. In this eafcy if the tumors producing the ob- ftrudion can be extirpated, no other means will afford fuch effedtual relief 5, but, when fo deeply feated as to render any attempt for removing them unfafe^ -the practice I have pointed out, of ma- king puneftures in the moft depending part of the tumor, muft be employed, from time to time, to palliate the fymp- toms. ' It has fometimes happened, in fuppref- fion of urine, whether arifing from ftric- tures in the urethra, or from ftones im- paded in it, that the urethra has burft, and the urine, in this manner, getting accefs to the cellular texture of the fero- tum.

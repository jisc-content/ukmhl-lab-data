574 Explanation of the Plates, larger extremities by two fcrew-naiis. The tube formed by thefe two hollow plates is of fuch a fize as to allow the perforator, fig. I. to bepufhed into it with very little force ; and the elafticity of the plates, which admits of their yielding to this paflage of the perforator, enables them to return inftantly to form the fame fize of tube, as foon as the large extremity of the inftruraent A has fairly palled the extre- mity of the plates. The point of the perforator with a fmall portion of the extremity of the tube being pulhed into the vaginal coat, the perforator is to be then withdrawn, which when the inftrument is properly made may be done without much force. The chief advantage of this inftrument is, that the point of the perforator making a larger opening than the canula, the lat- ter thereby enters with much eafe. But altho’ this invention of Mr Andre’s is neat and ingenious, It does not appear to be very neceflary 3 for, when the flat tro- car, fig. 4. of the fame plate is well finilhed, and

If thefe methods of operating were all equally pradicable, we would not hefi- tate to fix the preference : In raifing a tooth perpendicularly, much lefs violence muft be done to the contiguous parts than by forcing it out in a lateral di- redion: For as the roots of the teeth are all firmly fixed in bone, they cannot pof- fibly be prefled out laterally, but with fuch a force as Is fufficient for breaking or burfting opeq that part of the alveolar procefs of the jaw-bone with which they are furrounded^ and as thisds in general attended with fome laceration, and always with much contufion, of the contiguous foft

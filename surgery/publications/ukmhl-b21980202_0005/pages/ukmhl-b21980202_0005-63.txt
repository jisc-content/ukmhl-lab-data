Sed. IX. Difeafes of the Mouth. 55 in a perpendicular diredtion with much eafe. The advantage fuppofed to be derived from forceps with moveable claws is this: When common forceps is ufed with im- moveable claws, if the tooth is firm, it muft either be forced out obliquely, or the firfl: hold muft be loft, and the inftru- ment fixed again: But when the claws are moveable, the inftrument retains its hold, fo that the tooth may be pulled nearly in a perpendicular diredlion; for the claws, by turning upon centres, will always fall into the way of the toothy and will therefore raife it nearly in a ftraight line. I have taken different opportunities of obferving, that the moft painful part of tooth-drawing arifes from the bruifing and laceration of the gums and fockets; a circumftance that cannot be altogether avoided when the key-inftrument is em- ployed. The great objed of the forceps that I have juft defcribed being to pull in a ftraight direction, by which the gums

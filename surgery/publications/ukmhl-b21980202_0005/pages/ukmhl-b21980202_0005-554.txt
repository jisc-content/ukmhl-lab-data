54^ Hcsmatocele. Chap. XXV. In ftis, in an enlarged varicofe ftate, I am not inclined, therefore, to refer this kind of tumor to any fpecies of hsematocele, but rather to confider.it as a variety of varix. I have even feen this variety of tumor miftaken for a hydrocele, and treated as fuch, by a trocar being plun- ged into it, when the effedts were exad- ly what are defcribed by Mr Pott. But, if the blood had been extravafated, a more copious difcharge would have ta- ken place from the perforation, than was obtained by it in any of the cafes to which I allude. Even where the tumor has been of a conliderable lize, I never found it poflible to evacuate in this man- ner, more than a fpoonful or two of blood, and although, in fuch cafes, the blood appears evidently more vifcid than in a ftate of health, it is by no means fo much fo as ftiould prevent it from being freely difcharged by the canula of a tro- car, were it lodged In a ftate of extrava- I fation.

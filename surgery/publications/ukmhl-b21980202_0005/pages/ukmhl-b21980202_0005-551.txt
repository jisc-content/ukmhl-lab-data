Ciiap. XXV. On the Hematocele. 543 In LI4 procefs, or tunica vaginalis teftis, that the veflels from whence the blood is dif- charged cannot be difcovered; a very confiderable oozing, continuing from day to day, notwithftanding the ufe of bark, vitriolic acid, and every other means commonly employed. As patients in this lituation foon become weak and emacia- ted, one great objed: of the praditioner is to fupport them with nourifliing food. A moderate allowance of animal food proves always ufeful; nor is it found that a liberal ufe of wine does harm. In fome inftances, I have even thought that it tended to leffen the difcharges . I have uniformly, however, found, that local remedies prove chiefly ufeful, par- ticularly the application of ardent fpirits, aether, ox tindure of myrrh, to the fur- face of the fore; pledgits of foft lint, foaked in one or other of thefe^ and re- newed from time to time, not only ferve to check the difcharge of blood, but tend, for the moft part, to promote the forma- tion of good matter.

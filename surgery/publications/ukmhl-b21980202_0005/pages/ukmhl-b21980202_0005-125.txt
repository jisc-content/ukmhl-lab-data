Se£t. L Bifeafes of the Ears, 117 as the difeafe may in general be removed by means of a more Ample nature. This affedlion of the membrane of the ear I confider to be exa6lly fimilar to that va- riety of obftru6Hon in the urethra in which bougies prove particularly ufeful; and the fame remedy, when duly perfift- ed in, proves equally ferviceable in the one difeafe as in the other. In the intro- duilion of the bougie, care muft be taken not to pafs it to the depth of the tympa- num, otherwife it may do* more harm than good; and the fize of it muft from time to time be enlarged till the paflage becomes fufficiently open. When bougies are firft palled into the ear, they always create fome degfee of uneafinefs, by irritating the parts to which they are applied ; but this foon fubfides when they are ufed with caution, and properly oiled before being introduced. §4.

Sed. VI. On the Hydrocele^ 527 riety of hydrocele, the tumor has a fprin- gy kind of feel, and a fluduation is fen- fibly found in It. And in both the others, the fwelling in foine degree recedes upon preffure, which It never does in this va - riety of encyfted hydrocele. From a rupture of a portion of gut, it is chiefly diftlnguiflied by the tumor be- ginning, not at the ring of the external oblique mufcle, as Is the cafe In hernia, but farther down the cord^ In the lat- ter, the fwelling commonly turns lefs, on the patient being placed in a horizontal pofture; and it is always confiderably af- feded both by coughing and flieezing} but no'pofture, no prefliire, nor any ac- cidental circumftanee, alters the lize of this variety of hydrocele. The abfence of the fymptoms of hernia, too. Is here material in the diftlndion* For there is neither pain in the tumor, nor in the ab- domen; nor ficknefs, vomitings nor any interruption to the paiTage by ftool, as ve- ry commonly happens in hernia.

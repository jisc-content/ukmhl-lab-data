113 SecS. I. Difeajes of the Ears^ and other liquids, might be employed for this piirpofe : But nothing proves fo harm- lefs as oil; and although it does not kill every fpecies of infed: inftantaneoufly, yet few of them will live if immerfed in it for any length of time. The pa- tient fhould therefore be defired to reft his head upon the oppofite fide 3 and fome tepid oil being poured into the affeded ear, it may thus be eafily kept in it as long as is necelTary. Peas and other foft bodies that fwell with moifture, are apt to become fo large when they remain long in the ear, that they cannot but with much difficulty be extraded entire. In this cafe we ftiould endeavour to break them, either with the points of fmall forceps, or with a fliarp fmall hook cautioufly introduced along the paifage; and as foon as they are fuf- ficiently divided, they muft either be ta- ken out piece-meal with forceps, or waffl- ed out with a fyringe. ยง3.

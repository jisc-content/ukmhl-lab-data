Sed:. II. On the Hydrocele, 393 SECTION II. Of the Anafarcous Hydrocele of the Scrotum. HE fcrotum, from its cellular flruc- ture, and immediate connection with the trunk of the body, is apt to partake of every diffiifable fwelling with which the upper part of.the body is attacked: And, accordingly, we find, that general anafarcous fwellings feldom fubfift for any length of time, without affecting the fcrotum. A local anafarca of the fcro- tum, is fometimes indeed produced by a local'caufe, to wit, by the preffure of a tumor on the lymphatics of the part; by external injuries 3 and occafionally by an effufion of urine from a rupture of the urethra : But fuch occurrences are rare ^ a general difeafe of the conflitution being jhe ufual forerunner of thefe tumors.

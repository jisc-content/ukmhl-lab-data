Of the Paracentefs Chap. XXI. 210 ftinum, as this is fituated immediately below the fternum, any pain or oppref- fion that it excites, will be more confined to the centre of the bread:, than when the collection is feated in either of the cavi- ties of the cheft; and for the fame rea- fon, any opening intended to difcharge it muft be made directly through the fter- num itfelf, by a piece of that bone being taken out with the head of a trepan, fo as to admit of the parts affected being brought into view. The method of ap- plying the trepan I need not enter upon at prefect, as the operation has been al- ready defcribed in a preceding Chapter. All that appears to be farther neceffary upon the fubject is, that as foon as the cyft containing the fluid is laid bare, a perfo- ration fhould be made into it with a tro- car ; care being taken to manage the dif- charge in the fame cautious manner I _ have already advifed, and not to admit the parts newly laid open to be more ex- pofed to the air than is neceflary.

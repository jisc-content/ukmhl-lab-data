197 Se<S. II. of the T^horax. excellent Treatife on the Structure of the Heart, mentions as a charaderiftlc mark of this difeafe, a firm undulatory motion being perceived between the third, fourth, and fifth ribs on every pulfation of the heart. As it is not in any refped: neceflary for our fubjedl to enter minutely into the in- veftigation of the caufes of thefe collec- tions, all that I lhall fay refpeding it is, that whatever tends to produce dropfy in other parts of the body, will have a fimi- lar effedt in forming it here. The exiftence of water in the thorax be- ing afcertained, and the part in which it is colledled being difcovered, if the medicines employed in the cure fliall fail, and if it is evident that the patient muff: die if the operation is delayed, it ought certainly to be advifed without farther delay : Perforating the thorax is no doubt a very important operation, and it ought not to be advifed but in real danger. I do not however hefitate to fay, that it ihould be performed in every inftance where the attending fymptoms are hazar- dous.

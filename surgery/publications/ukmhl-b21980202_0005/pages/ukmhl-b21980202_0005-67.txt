IX* Difeafes of the Mouths almoft completely annihilated; and in- ftead of the long fangs with which thef^ teeth in a ftate of health are furnilhed, only a frnall point or two of fpoiled' bone has been met with. In confequence of this they become loofe^ and their con- nedion with the jaw being now very fu- perficial, they may be forced out much more eafily than a large tooth. I know that praditioners in general are not of this'opinion, the pulling of a dump being for the moft part confidered as a more difficult as well as a more painful opera- tion than the extradion of a large tooth* This, however, can proceed only from want of experience in this branch of pradlce^ for thofe who are more verflint in it know, that there is much more pain^ hazard, and difficulty, in the pulling of a complete tooth when firmly fixed, than in the taking out of feveral flumps. When the point of the claw can be for- ced fo far down upon a flump as to get a firm hold, it may be pulled with the key* inflrument in the manner I have advifed D 2 for.

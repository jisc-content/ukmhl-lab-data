It is not, however, by any means neceflary that this ftiould be univerfally adopted : For although in ge- neral it is fuppofed to anfwer beft to fix the claw of the inftrument on the found- eft fide of a tooth, and to turn it to the oppofite fide; yet with due pains and attention we might perhaps in every in- fiance follow the very reverfe of this with equal fuccefs : For with a proper applica- tion of the fcarificator, we may almoft al- ways feparate the gums, fo as to be able to prefs the point of the claw far enough VoL.

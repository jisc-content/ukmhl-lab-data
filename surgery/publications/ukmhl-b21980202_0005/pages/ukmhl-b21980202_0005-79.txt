Sedi. IX. Difeafes of the Mouth. 71 exhibition of Peruvian bark proves often effedlual in preventing a return of it; particularly where the fits of tooth- ach have returned periodically, as they fometimes do, fo regularly as to give caufe to imagine that they depend upon a tendency to ague. In this variety of toothach, arifing from an affedion of the flromach, no benefit is derived from laudanum. Inftead of pro- curing cafe, it fe^ms rather to increafe the pain, and, by inducing ficknefs, to render the patient in every refpedt worfe. But in thefe varieties of the difeafe, ori- ginating either from rheumatifm, gout, or hyfterical affedions, opiates will for the moft part remove the pain entirely : And a return of it may be frequently prevented merely by keeping the parts fufficiently warm. In hyfterical pa- tients, a combination of laudanum with ether has iometimes proved ufeful,â€™ when opiates in every other form have failed. Opiates are often ufed too in toothach induced by pregnancy; but feldom with advantage.

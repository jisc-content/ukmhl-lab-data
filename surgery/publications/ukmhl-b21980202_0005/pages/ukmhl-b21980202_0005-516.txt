5o8 , On the Hydrocele. Chap. IXXIV. did declaratiofih:- I muft confefs, that I took an early and deep rooted diflike to the cure of hydrotele by incilion*.‚Äù Labouring under this kind of terror at other operations, and difappointed, as It would feem, in his expectation of the operation by the feton, he was thus ready to adopt the practice of curing the difeafe with Injedllons, in the eafy manner repre- fented by the French, and which he has accordingly with great zeal done. If longer experience, and farther im- provement fhall evince the mode of curing the hydrocele by injecftions, to be equally fafe and certain with that by the fimple incifion, and fhall obviate the objections that 1 have ftated againfl: it, none will be more ready tp adopt it than I fhall be. In the mean while^ and In the prefent ftate of our knowledge, few praditioners will advife it, if it be not with thofe patients whofe timidity precludes the more certain and equally fafe method of cure, the ope- ration by incifion.

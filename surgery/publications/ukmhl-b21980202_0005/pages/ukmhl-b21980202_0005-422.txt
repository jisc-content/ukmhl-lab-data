414 On the Hydrocele. Chap. XXIV. However improbable it may appear, this variety of hydrocele has, in fome in- ftances been confounded with the anafar- cous tumor of the fcrotum^ but the means of diftindrion are fo evident, from the hi- ftory given above of the two difeafes, that it is not here neceflary to enter farther upon th6 fubjed. It muft, indeed, be grofs inattention only that can ever make the anafarcous hydrocele be miftaken for any other difeafe. From the encyfted hydrocele of the fpermatic cord, it may commonly be di- ftinguifhed by the tetticle In the latter be- ing plainly felt at the under part of the tumor^ whereas, in this difeafe, the teftis is feldom diftindly perceived if it be not at the back part of the tumor. In two cafes, I have met with the tefticle on the ante- rior part of a hydrocele ; and, in a third, although fixed behind in its ufual fitua- tion, it alfo adhered at one point to the middle and anterior part of the tunica va- ginalis. This I fufpeded to be the effedt of inflammation, induced either by hernia 3 ' humeralis.

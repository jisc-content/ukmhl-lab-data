572 Explanatioji of the Plates^ Fig. Plate LVIIL Fig. I. A flat trocar. Fig. 2* Another form of flat trocar, a very neat invention of Mr Wallace, a furgeon of eminence in Glafgow. This inftrument confifls of a llilette or perfo- rator, fig. 4. exactly adapted to the filver canula, fig. 3. The canula is open on one lide, which admits of the perforator being broader than itfelf, as is reprefented in fig. 2. By this means an opening is made by the perforator, which allows the canu- la to pafs with much eafe, and. as the fides of the canula do not fall together on the perforator being withdrawn, this inftru- ment is not liable to an objection that occurs againft the trocar of Mr Andre,, reprefented in Plate LIX. fig. 2. with which there is fome rilk of the fteel plates doing harm to the contents of the abdomen on thefe plates falling together, which they do with fome force on the canula being withdrawn.

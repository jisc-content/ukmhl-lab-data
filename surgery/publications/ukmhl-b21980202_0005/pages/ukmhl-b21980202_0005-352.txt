Dr Monro thinks favourably of it, and on his fuggeftion I have, in diffe- rent cafes, performed the operation In this manner. But, however unwilling I am to differ from fucli authority, I cannot in this inftance avoid it: The chief reafon afligned for not opening the fac, is, that we thereby prevent the air from finding accefs to the inteflines ; but although this would be highly defirable, if the operation could otherwife be equally well performed, as it does not appear to me that this can be done, I think it right to obferve, that the practice fhould be received with cau- tion, till, by farther obfervation, it is af- certained, whether it proves beneficial or not. The beft mode of doing this Would be for tho furgeons of thofe hofpitals- in which hernioe frequently occur, to perform the operation a confiderable nuaiber of times

At this place, viz, at the annular open- ing of the external oblique mufcle, the peritonaeum is vety loofe y and when the ligament and fcrotum are drawn down- wards, an aperture is obferved from the cavity of the abdomen all around the fore part of the ligament, that feems ready to receive the teftis; and this aperture gradually becomes larger as the teftis de- fcends behind the peritonaeum in its way to the fcrotum. While the tefticle is rea- dy to defcend, it does not fall down, as has been commonly imagined, along die fore part of the peritonaeum, between it and the other vifcera; but the ligament I have defcribed, as lying behind the pe- ritonaeum, and which is connedled with the teftis at its under and pofterior parts, by direding or pulling it down as it were, from behind, brings it in this manner a- VoL.

Chap. XXV- On the Hcematocele. 545 Pott remarks, a fluduation fomewhat like to that of a hydrocele of the tunica vagi*- nalis. When this is miftuken for a hydrocele, as it has fometimes been, and an opening with a trocar is made in it, a difcharge is produced, of a dark dufky coloured blood, nearly of the confiftence of thin chocolate; but the diminution of the tu- mor, by this evacuation, is feldom con- fiderable. The perforation, therefore, made in it with the trocar does no good; and as the tefticle is commonly fo far fpoiled by the difeafe as to be rendered quite ufelefs, ca- ftration is advifed as the only effedual re- medy I have different times met with a dif- eafe very fimilar to this defcribed by Mr Pott; but as the blood in fuch inftances did not appear to be extravafated, but to be ftill contained in the veffels of the te- ftis.

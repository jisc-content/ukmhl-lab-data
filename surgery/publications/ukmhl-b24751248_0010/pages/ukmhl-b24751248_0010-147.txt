Jahrb., Vol. ii, p. 60. Sclhff contends that febrile rigor and heat arc two phenomena independent of each other. He cites experiments of his own, to show that congestive febrile heat is not to be regarded as due to a paresis of the vascular nerves. In these experiments, febrile movement was excited in various waj^s, in animals who had the cervical sympathetic on the nerves of one limb divided. The result always was, that the local phenomena of congestion were strikingly absent in the parts whose nerves had been divided. Schiff attributes this to the paralysis of certain constituents of the walls of the vessels whose function is to produce dilatation. GENERAL SYSTEM, INDEX, TREATISES.

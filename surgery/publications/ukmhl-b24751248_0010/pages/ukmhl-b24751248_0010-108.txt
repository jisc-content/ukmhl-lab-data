Make a further correction for middle and old age, by calculating according to columns 1 or 2, and then deducting 10 per cent., if the per- son be between forty and fifty; 20 per cent., if between fifty and sixty ■ 30 per cent., if between sixty and seventy; and 50 per cent., above seventy. These numbers, it must be borne in mind, are quite pro- visional, as the analyses are so few. Future observations will confirm or correct them. 4. Correct for diet.—If the persons have been starving for two or more days (as in some fevers), deduct one third from the calculation, when made according to the table. If the diet be meagre, deduct one sixth or one eighth; if pretty plentiful, yet still below that of health, deduct one tenth. 5. Correct for movement.—If there be total inactivity, deduct one tenth ; if merely quietude, deduct one twentieth. Corrections ought also to be made for the amount of fluid drunk, the action of the external temperature, and the condition of the other elimi- nating organs, &c.; but our author has not yet determined the proper figures for these agencies. Only the chief urinary ingredients are here given, as the amounts of the rest are so uncertain. The uric acid, being so little influenced by weight, cannot be calculated. Parkes subjoins a case of his own to show the working of the plan. A healthy man, aged thirty, on moderate hospital diet, weighed 114 lbs. Required the physiological amount of urea in twenty-four hours. 3.53 x 114 = 402.42 grains. Correct for moderate diet; deduct one eighth : 402.42 — 50.3 =352.12 grains. Correct for bodily inactivity; deduct one twentieth: 352.12—17.65 = 334.47 grains. The physiological amount determined by actual experiment (mean of six days) in this man was 346.7 grains, being only 12 grains above the calcu- lated amount. Rev. Samuel Hatjghton.—On the Natural Constants of the Urine of Man. Dub. Quart., vol. xxx, p. 1 (concluded from vol. xxviii, p. 17). See last Year Book, p. 97. Haughton made a number of observations on the food taken by the persons he experimented upon, particularly with reference to the nitrogen received in the food, compared with the quantity of nitrogen excreted by the urine. The results of his observations he gives in detail, and then deduces from them the following inferences: 1. The quantity of urea passed per day, by men in health, varies with

This report refers to twenty-four cases of puerperal fever observed in the hospital at Munich ; of these sixteen died. In all cases the uterine mucous membrane presented an offensive, discoloured, diphtheritic covering. The character of the fever was mostly pysemic. In the treatment free admis- sion of air and vaginal injections were considered important. None of the special therapeutic agents employed appear to have proved decidedly and universally beneficial.

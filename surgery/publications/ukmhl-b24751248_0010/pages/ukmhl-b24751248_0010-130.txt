120 ltEl'OHT ON THE INSTITUTES Oi' MEDICINE. Fluids Nos. 2 and 4 from the first case, nnd No. 1 from the second case, were tested for potash, and only traces were detected. The fluids obtained from the first and second cases of hydrocephalus contained (as also did the others) no indican. Sugar was not detected in the first ; hut in the second it appeared to be in considerable quantity— nearly 1 gramme (= ingrains) in 1000 c.c. (= 1.761 pints). The fluid obtained from the second case of hydrocephalus, when punctured the third time, had a sp. gr. of 1005, coagulated on being heated ; it contained no blood-corpuscles, had an alkaline reaction, and was devoid of sugar. On analysis by the polariscope, it yielded in 1000 c.c. (= 1*761 pints)— Grammes. '. Grains.

It was coagulated by heat and by acetic acid, and contained therefore not only meta-albumen, but also ordinary albumen. No sugar was detected in it. The pure cerebro-spinal fluid, on the other hand, contained meta-albumen, but no ordinary albumen. Hoppe looks upon the coagulability of the cerebro-spinal fluid by heat, and therefore the presence of ordinary albumen in it, as a characteristic sign of inflammatory action. lie gives the subjoined analysis of some pure cerebro-spinal fluid (with the ex- ception of a few blood-corpuscles) taken from a girl aged five months.

Bodecker.. — On the Quantitative Analysis of Albumen in Solutions by Weighing, and by the Volumetric Method. Henle and Pfeufer, vol. v, parts 2 and 3. Canst., vol. i, p. 205. The old method of estimating the quantity of albumen in a liquid by coagulating, drying;, and weighing, Bodecker says, is not only fatiguing, but also occasionally inexact; he proposes, therefore, to calculate the quantity of albumen by means of a standard solution of ferrocyanide of potassium. The standard solution is prepared by dissolving 1..309 grammes (about 21 grains) of ferrocyanide of potassium in 1000 c.c. (1.761 pints) of distilled water; each c.c. of this liquid represents one milligramme of albumen. The solution of albumen about to be analysed, if concentrated, is to be first diluted with water, neutralised with acetic acid, nnd well mixed. And in those cases where the albumen is contained within a membrane, as in the egg, for example, it ought to be

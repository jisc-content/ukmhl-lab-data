RKl'OKT ON PUBLIC HEALTH. lot; outbreak of smallpox .it the close of 1859. In the schools of St. Pancras, which were inspected by the author with a view to the prevention of smallpox, containing 8324 children, 456 were found to be without marks of vaccination, and 1218 had but indistinct indications. The author also describes the prophylactic measures adopted by the officers of health in combination throughout the metropolis, and especially those directed to the promotion of vaccination, viz. :—1. The compilation of lists of children not appearing as vaccinated on the registers of births, followed by personal visitation of all such children. 2. Medical inspection of all public schools, and of private schools when permission could be obtained. 3. Inquiries made by the sanitary inspectors, in the course of their rotatory domiciliary visitation, as to the vaccination of the children inhabiting the houses inspected. In St. Pancras these means were successfully brought to bear on more than 5000 cases of neglect. Berg.—The Protective Power of Vaccination, Henke, vol. xxxix, p. 420. From Berg's tables of the births, population, and mortality of Sweden in the years 1748—1849, and of the special mortality from smallpox and the number of vaccinations, it is shown incontestable that vaccination, although not affording certain protection against smallpox, has deprived the disease of its former desolating power. Vaccination appears to have first become general in the year 1805. After this period the annual mor- tality from smallpox only exceeded 1000 in five years, viz. 1825— (1243), 1833(1145), 1838(1805), 1839(1954), 1850(1007). These were all years in which smallpox prevailed epidemically. Comparing them with epidemic years previous to 1805, we have in 1752 a mortality of 10912, in 1784, 12455, ™ I7^5> 17375' *n 1800, 12058. According to Professor Berg, no observations have been made in Sweden favouring the assumption that scrofula, eruptive fevers, or other diseases, bad increased or become more malignant since the introduction of vaccination. Husband.—On the Method of Preserving Vaccine Lymph. Report of the Medical Officer of Health to the Privy Council, for 1859, p. 20. Dr. Husband describes minutely the method, first introduced by himself, of preserving lymph in a liquid state within uniformly capillary tubes, hermetically sealed at both extremities. Crkly.—On the same subject. Ibid., p. 24. Mr. Ceely visited Edinburgh by direction of the Privy Council, for the purpose of inquiring into the efficacy of Dr. Husband's method, which is generally employed by the profession there, and, indeed, throughout Scotland. He saw perfect results obtained by vaccination with specimens of lymph which had been thus preserved for as many as seven years, and relates other facts which, in his opinion, conclusively establish the advan- tages of the method.

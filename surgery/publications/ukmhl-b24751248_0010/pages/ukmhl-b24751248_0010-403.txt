393 DISEASES OF CHILDREN. S. Prall.—The Marshall-Hall Method of Treatment in Asphyxia (Neo- natorum). Lancet, Nov. 3d, i860, p. 446. In Prall's case, the Marshall-Hall method is stated to have been the means by which resuscitation was effected after an interval of twenty- five minutes. Keyt.—The Mouth to Mouth versus the Marshall-Hall Method in As- phyxia Neonatorum. Cincinnati Lancet and Obs., Jan., i860. Am. Med.-Chir. Rev., March, i860, p. 332. Keyt states that the case of the new-born child is not quite parallel with that of the adult, and that he has found the old method successful in cases where the " Ready Method" had been employed with negative results.

Brekt.—On Fatal Effects arising from Enlargement of the Thymus Gland in Children. Lancet, Sept. 8th, i860, p. 236. Brent records a case of death in a child two and a half years old, which took place suddenly after " two convulsive fits." The tbymus gland weighed one ounce and a quarter. The other organs were perfectly healthy. Death was attributed to the enlargement of the thymus, which produced irritation of the recurrent nerves and spasmodic closure of the glottis. Clar.—Observations on Anomalies of the Thymus. Jahrb. f. Kind., 18^9, 3, p. 106. Canst., vol. iv, p. 392. Clar reports eight cases of anomalies of the thymus. Enlargement of this organ plays an important part, according to him, in giving rise, singly or combined with diseases of other parts, to fatal or dangerous results in infancy and early life.

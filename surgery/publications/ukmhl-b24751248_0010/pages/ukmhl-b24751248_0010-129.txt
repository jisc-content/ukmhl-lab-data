SUBJECTS OF GENERAL INTEREST. 119 Bodecker also examined the fluid of two ovarian cysts from the same woman. One of the cysts was of old standing, the other of very recent formation. • 1. Fluid from the old cyst. It was of a clear yellow colour, slightly alkaline reaction, not glutinous, of a sp. gr. of 1009, and contained 5.77 per cent, of solid matter, which consisted chiefly of alhumen and some chloride of sodium. Mucus was only present in the very smallest quan- tity. Glutin, or a somewhat analogous suhstance, leucin, and ammonia, were found ; but neither urea, sugar, nor tyrosin could be detected. 2. Fluid from the recently formed cyst. It was of a reddish-brown colour, thick, and glutinous, had an alkaline reaction, and a sp. gr. of It contained nearly 21 per cent, of solid matter, no sugar but a little urea, ammonia, and. leucin (less than in the 1049. or tyrosin, old cyst).

Hoppe analysed the fluid obtained (by puncture) from two cases of spina bifida and three cases of hydrocephalus. The first case of spina bifida was punctured four times, and in every 1000 parts of fluid were— I. 11. IV. Albumen Water-extractive . . Alcohol-extractive . . Soluble Salts . . . .

Nos. 1 and 2, when tested for sugar, reduced the oxide of copper; but No. 4 did not; so it was concluded that only the former contained sugar. The second case of spina bifida was twice punctured, and on both occasions yielded an alkaline fluid, which gave offcarbonic acid gas on the addition of acetic acid. Only the fluid obtained the second time reduced the oxide of copper. The analysis gave in 1000 c.c. (= 1.761 pints) : I. II. Grammes. Grains. Grammes.

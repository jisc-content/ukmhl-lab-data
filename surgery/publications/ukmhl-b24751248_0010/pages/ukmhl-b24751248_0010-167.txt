Lefevre endeavours to prove that the colic of hot countries is nothing but lead colic, but does not give any direct proof that such is the case. A. Wood.—Case of Tumour of the Brain. Edin. Med. J., Jan., i860. Wood relates a case of tumour of cancerous character, occupying the floor of the fourth ventricle. Among other symptoms, the patient suffered from constant noises in the head, and unpleasant visions before her eyes. With regard to the latter, there was this remarkable peculiarity, that there was a regular alternation of dark and bright spectra. On one day she would see nothing but black objects, chiefly coffins; on the next, flashes of fire, and the luminous ball, would be the chief source of her suffering. The intellect was remarkably clear, but the eyes were constantly rolling. RoxzterJoly.—On Treatment of'Acute Chorea by Arsenic. Bullet. Gen.de Therap., Oct. 15th, 1859. Brit, and For. Med.-Ch. Rev., Jan., i860. Joly records a case of acute chorea, treated successfully with arsenic. The dose was raised from ^r to % grain, and subsequently diminished to Ty, which was continued till the 26th day, when con- valescence was fairly in progress. C. Tcxgel.—A Case of New Formation of Gray Cerebral Matter. Archiv. f. path. Anat., Vol. xvi, hefte 1 and 2. Brit, and For. Med.-Ch. Rev., Jan., i860. Tungel records a case of new formation of gray cerebral matter. This was found at the posterior horns of the lateral ventricles, forming circular tumours, separated from one another by intervals of white matter. The brain was otherwise normal. No nerve tubes were seen in the tumours; only a granular mass with granular cells.

Lancet, i860, vol. i, pp. 291, 341, 390, 541, and vol. ii, p. 104. Dr. Barnes's inquiry is intended to determine, by the results of practical experience, the question as to the value of turning in cases of pelvic coarctation, where the forceps are inadmissible, and craniotomy is the only other alternative. The argument to be encountered is this : the application of turning being limited to those cases in which the pelvis measures less than 3.25", are we justified, for the sake of the very slender hope of saving the child under such circumstances, in subjecting the mother to the dangers of the operation ? In the first case related, a third pregnancy was terminated favorably to mother and child by premature labour and turning combined, craniotomy having been performed in both the previous labours. The pelvis was so narrow that the child could not liave been delivered in any other way with a like result. In a second case, the conjugate diameter was 3.50", the labour protracted,and craniotomy performed. In the following pregnancy, advice as to premature labour being disregarded, the same difficulty occurred. Turning was performed with success, the author admitting that the forceps might have been successful, but preferring turning, for reasons stated. In a third case recorded, the conjugate diameter was 3", the presentation footling; and, after some 23

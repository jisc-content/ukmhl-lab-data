Labour had lasted three days when the author was called in. Delivery was effected by craniotomy.

The author premises his observations by an account of the practice of various obstetric authorities as regards the treatment of the perinseum during labour. The causes of perinseal laceration are—1, Deformities of the pelvis, causing the head to descend too low before the extension move- ment under the pubic arch begins; 2, fcetal deformity, or mal-presentation; 3, rigidity of the perinseuin and ostium vaginae; 4, too great rapidity of labour ; 5, injudicious or unskilful use of instruments ; 6, occlusion of the vaginal orifice by hymen; 7, fatty deposition in, or degeneration of, the perinseum ; 8, the mechanical support of the perinaeum. Pressure from the outside prevents, it is contended, the lateral portions of the perinseum from bearing their own share of the tension ; it also subjects a part already on the stretch to an injurious amount of pressure. Again, the pressure of the hand throws the muscles of the perinseum into contraction. Statistics show that lacerations occur more frequently when artificial sup- port is most, practised, as on the Continent. He recommends, in cases where it is desirable to retard the progress of the head, that during the last pains the woman should be made to hold the mouth open, when the expulsive strain cannot long be continued; that lubrication be employed in cases of rigidity of the perinseum, and that pressure be made by the fingers against the head itself. Firm pressure against the sacrum is also recommended. Metallic sutures are to be employed, should the perinaeum be torn. On Supporting the Perinaum.—Samuel Smith; Brit. Med.

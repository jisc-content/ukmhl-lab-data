132 EBPOUT ON TIIR INSTITUTES OF MEDICINE. Pravnz considers the effects of rarefied air on the organism to be— I, incomplete pulmonary expansion, with compensatory acceleration of the respiration ; 2, quickening of the arterial circulation ; 3, slackening of the capillary and venous currents; 4, retarded tissue-change; and 5, diminished stimulation of the nervous system as a result of insufficiently oxygenized blood. The principal effects of condensed air on the system he finds to be—I, that the lungs expand more thoroughly; 2, respiration is less frequent; 3, the arterial current becomes slower; whilst, 4, the venous and capillary circulation augments in speed ; 5, the excretion of carbonic acid and of urine is increased; 6, the appetite improved ; and 7, the nervous system exhilarated by the highly oxygenated blood. Pravaz advises the employment of condensed air in brain and spinal affections, some cases of muscular contraction and deafness, and also in articular, scrofulous, and rickety diseases. A spinal curvature, as it was before and after treatment, is figured.

The employment of acupressure in aneurism and secondary haemorrhage is suggested by the author, who relates an experiment be made on a sheep, in which he passed a bodkin beneath the carotid artery, inserted a harelip-pin in the eye of the bodkin, and then, bending the (jin down across the artery, tied it and the bodkin together. After forty-eight hours he removed this " acuprcssor," and next day, when the animal was killed, he found the artery firmly plugged with clot. Dix.—On the Advantages of Acupressure over the Liyalure.

Simpson recommends the compression of bleeding vessels, on the face of the stump, hy long needles, which are to be passed through the thick- ness of the flaps, across the vessels, in such a manner as to embrace a small portion of tissue on either side of them.

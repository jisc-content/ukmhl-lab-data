Reil observes that, in Cairo the air is very dry, and the thermome- trical oscillations arc pretty considerable during the winter months; whilst in Madeira the air is very moist, and the variations of temper- ature are trifling. " An acute form of phthisis, with intense fever, frequent short cough, great dyspnoea on exertion, expectoration scanty, but often sang-uinolent: such are the symptoms which appear to indi- cate a residence in Madeira;" while in chronic phthisis, with abundant, not sangiuneous expectoration, and occasional ameliorations, Cairo is preferable. There seems to be some evidence to show that albuminuria lias ceased in phthisical residents in Cairo, and that the process of granular degeneration has been arrested (from autopsies). In such cases also, cavities have been found in jDrogress of contraction and cure.

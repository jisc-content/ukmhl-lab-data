372 REPORT ON BtUDWIFBBT. KTC. S. Jas. A. Salter.—C««e 0/ Ovarian Tumour containing Teelh, Hair, fye,, with Remarks. Guy's IIosp. Hep., i860, p. 511. A very complete nml minute description is here given of lite contents of an ovnrinn cyst containing liair, teeth, &c. The author rejects altogether the idea that these growths are the result of impregnation. The answer to the question—What does give rise to these productions? is to be found in the analogy which these formations have to the non- sexual reproduction which is now known to prevail in many of the lower animals, c. g. the aphides in daphnia, in hive-bees, &c.; they are altogether equivalent to virgin-produced "zooids" previous to their detachment from the parent.

Goyraud thinks this more common than any other luxation. It usually happens in young children, when, in falling, they are dragged by the hand to keep them up ; at this moment the person who has hold of the child's hand feels a snapping noise; the child gives a cry, and its arm drops; the forearm is slightly flexed j the hand pronated, and cannot be moved. A mechanical impediment opposes attempts to forcibly supinate the hand. An oedematous swelling appears on the back of the wrist. According to the author, this would appear to have been often mistaken for an injury of the elbow-joint. Lorinser.—Fracture at the Lower End of the Bones of the Fore-arm. Wien. Med. Wchnschr., 10.

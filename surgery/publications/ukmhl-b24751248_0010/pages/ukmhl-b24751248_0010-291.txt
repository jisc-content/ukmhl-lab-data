Hebdom., Nos. 33, 37, 43, 45, 50, and 53, 1858. Canst., vol. v, p. 21^. Sub-periosteal resection presents this feature, that it not merely pre- serves the patient's limb, but attempts the reproduction of the bone. With particular reference to this point, Oilier has analysed thirteen opera- tions of this kind performed by Larghi ; in two of the most remarkable of these, considerable portions of the humerus were reproduced. Langenbeck.—Contributions to Osteoplasty : a preliminary communica- tion. Deutsche Klinik, No. 48. Canst., vol. v, p. 235. The author shows that it is possible to get reunion of a bone which has been completely separated from its bony connections, so long as the periosteum covering it remains connected with that of the parent-bone by a bridge. He illustrates the reproduction of bone by the periosteum, by some very remarkable cases where the knowledge of this fact was turned to practical account in operating. 4. Fractures of Bones of Face.

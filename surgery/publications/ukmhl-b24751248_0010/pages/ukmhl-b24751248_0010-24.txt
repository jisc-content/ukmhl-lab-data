EJSPOB/I ON THE INSTITUTES OF MEDTCINE. 11 (/). Aqueous humour and crystalline lens. Contained small quantity of sugar. (m). Fluid from the pericardium. Contained 0.17 per cent, of sugar. (n). Fluid from the abdomen. Was saccharine; contained abundance of ammoniacal salts. (0). Bile. Contained sugar. Careful observations were made on the urine in this case during the patient's life, and the more important of the results were— 1. On mixed diet, consisting of bread, potatoes, rice, cheese, meat, coffee, milk, and wine, continued during eight days, the man passed, on an average, 6268 c.c. (202.19 ozs0 water, and 500.25 grammes (j6.1 ozs.) sugar. Sp. gr. 1030—1040. 2. During seven days the patient was fed upon green vegetables instead of bread and potatoes, and had an increase of meat in place of the cheese. The daily average result was 4871 c.c. (157.1 ozs.) water, and 364.48 grammes (11.75 ozs-) sugar. Sp. gr. 1035—1040. 3. During other thirteen days the man continued taking the same food, except that he now received an additional four ounces of bread, lie also took bicarbonate of soda, beginning with two, and ending with six, drachms daily. The result now was, 5707 c.c. (184 ozs.) urine, 410.74 grammes (13.24 ozs.) sugar. Sp. gr. 1034—1040. In this last series of experiments the urea was also calculated by Liebig's method, and it gave a daily average of 59.75 grammes (1.92 oz.) 4. During other five days the patient received a still larger quantity of animal food, along with green vegetables, coffee, and about ten ounces of wine. He had also given to him from three to eight grains of reduced iron, three times a day. The result was that he passed, on an average, 3010 c.c. (97.09 ozs.) urine; 179.0 grammes (5.77 ozs.) sugar; 63.59 grammes (2.05 ozs.) urea. Sp. gr. 1034—1038. 15. During six days the man again received the same food, except having, in addition, four ounces of bread. The result was, 3308 c.c. (106.7 ozs-) urme; 204.36 grammes (6.58 ozs.) sugar. Sp. gr. 1035— io39- As there exists a close relation between inosite and sugar, Neukomm also tested the diabetic urine for the latter substance, and succeeded in finding some. The quantity, however, was not great. Prof. W. A. Guy.—Croonian Lectures on the Numerical Method, and its Application to the Science and Art of Medicine. Brit. Med. Journ., $fch May, pp. 331, 371, 409. 467> 553> 593- In the first lecture, Guy points out why he prefers the term numerical, method to that of statistical method. He says he knows of no use of numbers which claims to be peculiar to the 'Science of States,' and thinks that we ought to limit " the barbarous word statistics " to what it means in practice—a state science, built up by the aid of facts brought together in large numbers, and their results expressed in the terse, simple, and intelligible language of figures. The author says that the object of his lectures is to place the numerical method before us in the broadest and clearest light, and in order to do so lie begins by passing in brief review some of the principal sciences and

"While admitting that lie was formerly in error in taking for fresh-burst Graafian follicles what were really only blood-extravasations or purulent infiltrations in the tissue of the ovary, Scanzoni still contends that, although the proof of the continuance of ovulation during pregnancy, viz., the presence of newly burst Graafian vesicles in pregnant women, cannot be adduced, yet there are weighty grounds for the conclusion that a periodic ripening of the ova persists, although this may not be accompanied by actual bursting of the follicle.

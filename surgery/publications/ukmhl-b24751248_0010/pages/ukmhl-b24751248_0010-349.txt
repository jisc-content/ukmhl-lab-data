839 PREGNANCY. Dr. Dhuitt.—Practical Remarks on Foetal Auscultation. Med. Times and Gaz., Jan. 21st, i860, p. 57. Dr. Druitt concludes that the sounds of the foetal heart may be at times inaudible in a small number of cases ; that, nt times, the sound may- be indistinct; but that in all cases of pregnancy with a live child, at some times, and generally at all times, during the later months, the sounds may be heard clearly and unmistakeably.

Schmidt, vol. 106, p. 187. Crede finds that in not a few cases these cicatrix-like streaks are not formed at all during pregnancy, and sometimes in cases where pregnancy has repeatedly occurred there is no trace of them. This happened in ten per cent, of the cases examined. Dr. James Jones.—Case of Tumour in the Abdomen, with a History of Supposed Pregnancy. Med. Times and Gaz., July 21, p. 58, i860. Dr. Rout. C.

King's new pelvimeter consists of a cylindrical female syringe, through the extremity of which two diverging steel prongs, with knobbed ends, protrude, like the horns of a snail, and which are connected with the piston. The extent to which the diverging horns are protruded is marked off on the stem of the piston.

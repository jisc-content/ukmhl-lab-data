SYPHILIS. 323 any symptom, and first betray itself by the syphilitic affection of the children. , . 3. The reverse may, however, happen, viz., fathers infected with general syphilis may neither infect their wives, nor produce syphilitic children ; or if the wife become infected, yet the child may be bom healthy, and remain so; or if the first children perished, yet the subsequent children may be born without syphilis. 4. The customary "mercurial treatment does not guarantee against relapse in the persons of the parents, nor against transmission of the disease to the children. But this defect is common to all other modes of treatment, and it must be granted that syphilis in parents and children is most certainly and safely treated by mercury. Duncalfe, H.—Gonorrheal and Syphilitic Rheumatisms. Brit. Med. Jour., June 9, p. 432. The author endeavours to show that rheumatism occurring during the progress of venereal disease is dependent upon it, and not merely concomi- tant j and he draws attention to the importance of a correct appreciation of the relative connection of these diseases. Fischer.—On Syphilitic Myositis. (This article is extracted from a long memoir on myositis, published in the ' Union Medicale de la Gironde, Janvier et Fevrier, 1859.) Ann. par Jamain et Wahu, Fischer adopts Bouisson's arrangement of syphilitic affections of muscles, viz.—(1) muscular pains, or syphilitic rheumatisms; (2) muscular con- traction, of which this memoir particularly treats; and (3) gummy tumours of the muscles. Thia transformation is consequent on a slow inflammation of the muscular tissue. It begins slowly, with vague pain, especially at night, and some constraint in the movements of the limb. The muscles slowly enlarge, become harder, more elastic, and their con- traction is difficult, painful, and imperfect. In the course of the disease the hardness of the muscles increases and approaches that of cartilage, and movement is impossible. This condition is followed by an atrophic shortening.

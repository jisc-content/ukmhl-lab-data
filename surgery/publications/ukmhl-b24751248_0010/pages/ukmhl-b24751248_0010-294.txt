According to the author, tliere is only a single primary dislocation of tbe bend of tbe humerus downwards. Secondary displacements may be caused by tbe continued nction of external forces, or by muscular con- traction, and these have been hitherto considered distinct forms. The signs of primary luxation are so clear, that even when complicated by swelling, fracture of tbe surgical neck of the humerus or scapula, they can scarcely, the author thinks, be overlooked. He practises Celsus' method for effecting reduction—upward extension of the arm, and counter-extension, by a towel carried over tbe shoulder. Middeldokpff.—The Upright Luxation of the Shoulder.

A boy, aged 16, was thrown on bis face from a cart, the wheel of which passed over his right shoulder from below upwards, making a wound through which the lower angle of the scapula projected, and breaking off a small piece of the bone. The protruding bone was replaced with difficulty, and it was necessary to enlarge the external wound. Sissons, H.—Dislocation of the Humerus into the Subscapular Fossa, lied.

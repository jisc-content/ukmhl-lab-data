GENITOURINARY SYSTEM. 103 He then examined the amount of urea passed (in twenty-four hours) during typhoid fever in no less than fifty cases (thirty males, twenty females). The results are— _ .. Males. Females. Duration of Disease. Grammes. Grains. Grammes. Grains. One week . . . 43.2 669.60 34.0 527.00 Two weeks . Three weeks Four weeks. 39.9 618.45 30-2 468.10 30.9 478-95 24-i 373-55 23.2 359-6° 20-5 3I7-75 From this table it is seen, that during typhoid fever, especially in the early part of the disease, the urine contains a much greater quantity of urea than in health. The author looks upon this increase in the amount of urea as being in some measure a characteristic sign of the disease; for although in other febrile states the excretion of urea is augmented, it is never so much so as in the case of typhoid fever. Moreover, he observes, that the quantity of urea passed in twenty-four hours stands in direct re- lationship with the temperature of the body, the loss of flesh, and rapidity of the pulse. A great decrease (but never below the normal standard) in the quantity of urea excreted was observed to take place when haemorrhage from the bowels occurred during the course of the disease. In a day or two after the haemorrhage ceased, the amount of urea augmented. "Warncke remarks, that when the pulmonary organs become affected during the course of the disease, the amount of urea undergoes no appre- ciable change. Gastric has a very different effect from typhoid fever on the quantity of urea passed; notwithstanding their symptoms being so very much alike, the proportion of urea excreted is reversed, that is to say, in gastric fever the quantity falls below the normal standard. The following table shows this: Males. Females. Grammes. Grains. Grammes. Grains. One week . . . 22.1 342.55 18.0 279.0 Two weeks . . . 24.1 363-55 19-8 306.9 Three weeks . . 25.7 398.35 20.0 310.0 The author adds the interesting case of a young man, who, while suffering from gastric fever, passed a normal quantity of urea; whereas, when a short time afterwards he was attacked with typhoid fever, the amount of urea immediately increased. Warncke concludes, from the results of his_ experiments, that the quantity of urea might, in some cases, aid in deciding whether a doubtful case was gastric or typhoid fever. S. Ringer.—On the Relative Amount of Sugar and Urea in the Urine of Diabetes Mellitus. Trans. Med. Chir. Soc, i860, p. 323. Lancet, nth August. Ringer made his observations on two cases in University College Hospital, and the following are the conclusions at which he arrived: 1 st. That after the influence of food on the urine has entirely dis- appeared, a constant ratio is maintained between the sugar and urea. 2d. That after a purely non-amylaceous and non-saccharine meal, both the sugar and the urea are increased, but that during this increase the same ratio between them is observed. This ratio is 1 of urea to 2 2 of sugar.

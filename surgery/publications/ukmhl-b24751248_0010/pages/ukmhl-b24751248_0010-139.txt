Rend., vol. xlvii, p. 1013. Canst., vol. i, p. 211. Every one is familiar with the fact, that different races of the same species of animals are characterised by certain external peculiarities ; few, however, are aware that the chemical composition of the internal secretions in a similar manner varies with the race. The researches of Filhol and Joly have clearly demonstrated this fact as regards the milk of the sheep. Their analyses of the fresh milk of different races of sheep fed in the same manner, and kept under the same conditions, on a farm near Toulouse, gave the following results : English Sheep. Dishley. Southdown. Merino. Laraquais. Tarascon. , -» V 6.50 8.05 Casein 7-5° 7.90 9.02 8.30 5.00 3-7o 4.00 7.60 IO.40 10.40 S-So 5-35 4.61 4-37 4.16 4.16 Extractive and Salts . 0.70 o-SS O.69 0.61 0.16 0.16 81.00 82.50 84.20 78.40 76.98 77-23 100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00 The greatest variation is seen to be in the quantity of butter yielded by the different races of sheep; the milk of the Laraquais and Tarascon sheep is the richest, that of the English the poorest in that ingredient. Schlossberger.—The Bile of the Kangaroo. Liebig's Annal., vol. cx, p. 244. Canst., vol. i, p. 235. The bile that Schlossberger examined came from an animal that died of indigestion. It was perfectly neutral, thick, reddish yellow, and had a peculiar smell. The microscope revealed in it small, round, conglome- rate, yellow crystals, resembling leucin. They were soluble both in ammonia and nitric acid ; but the quantity was too small to allow of their true nature being discovered. The analysis of the bile gave, in 100 parts — Water .... 85.87 Solids .... i4-*3 Mucus and Colouring-matter . . . 4.34 Cholcstearin and Fat . . . .1.09 Salts of the Biliary Acids . . . 7.59 Loss, and other Salts . . . .1.11 1413 The biliary acids contained only 2.47 per cent, of sulphur. The bile of the kangaroo is therefore, with the exception of the pig's, the poorest in that substance. 9

West calls attention to the hitherto somewhat neglected field of study presented by diseased conditions of the mind in childhood. The mental peculiarities of children are first discussed, and the peculiar tendency to moral perversion in the case of children is pointed out. A disposition to exaggeration of existing ailments, or to feigning of such as have no existence is not uncommonly observed. Cases are then detailed in illustration ot the author's views.

Similar injury and mode of death ; superficial and iutra-ventriculnr sanguineous effusion. Obs. xvi. Similar injury ; primary laceration of brain and very exten- sive haemorrhage external to dura mater ; consecutive cephalitis and arach- nitis; extent of lesions immediately consequent on injury sucb ns to imply immediate death ; this inference contradicted by existence of se- condary lesions; actual duration of case, four days. Obs. xvn. Blow from a flint; fracture of frontal bone, effusion of blood and " puril'orm albumen" external to dura mater. Tbe patient, a female, aet. 24, was able to follow her occupation until twelve days after the injury, when symptoms of compression appeared suddenly, followed by death in five hours ; inference, that the injury was not essentially mortal. Obs. xvni. Blow from a sharp stone; abscess of anterior lobe of left hemisphere; arachnitis of right side. Obs. xix. Ecchymosis of the eyelids, fracture of the bones of tbe nose; immediate loss of consciousness; recovery. Obs. xx. Contu- sions of face and head, no fracture; slight effusion of blood on the surface of brain and in tbe left internal temporal fossa ; inference, sudden cerebral congestion occasioned by a fall down a stone staircase, followed immediately by concussion and sligbt haemorrhage. Obs. xxi. Fall and blows on the right side of head ; extensive superficial sanguineous effusion ; absence of lesion of integuments or fracture; pre-existing softening of right optic thalamus : inference, that lesions were dependent secondarily on previous disease. Obs. xxn. During life, fracture of inferior maxillary bone; haemorrhage from the nose and ears: inference, fracture of base. Obs. xxili. Fracture of base and of right parietal, frontal, and temporal bones ; double effusion of blood; 1, superficial, subjacent to fracture; 2, in the left internal temporal fossa: inference, that the injury was consequent on a fall. Obs. xxiv (during life). Case of fracture of the base, consequent on a fall during a quarrel. Obs. XXV. Extensive sanguineous effusion both internal and external to dura mater; depressed fracture of frontal, of right and left parietal and temporal bones ; absence of external wound ; inference, that the injury was occasioned instantaneously by a very violent blow with an instrument of great breadth. The third section is devoted to "diseases of the brain and its membranes which have given rise, in consequence of ill-founded charges, to judicial autopsies without result," viz., "cerebral congestion, meningitis, acute hydrocephalics, apoplexy, and eclampsia." Obs. xxvi. Cerebral conges- tion aud pulmonary apoplexy; absence of indications of violence ; sudden death during the act of digestion. Obs. XXVII.

Suspicion of violence; serous effusion not only in the ventricles, but also at the surface of the brain ; abscess of the spleen, purulent absorption. Obs. xxx.

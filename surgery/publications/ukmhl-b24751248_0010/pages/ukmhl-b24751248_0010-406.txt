Med. Journ., Feb., i860, p. 693. Spence relates eight cases, which, with cases formerly reported, make together thirteen cases, in which tracheotomy was performed in croup ; in all, the patients were "in extremis" from threatened suffocation.

Sendler recommends the employment of a double cannula, in the inner one of which is inserted a conductor. The extremity of the cnnula is, by its means, rendered rounded and pyramidal in shape, so as to facilitate its introduction ; after which it is withdrawn. The length of the cannula should be at least two inches. The dorsal opening he considers useless and dangerous. Henriette. — On Tracheotomy in Croup. Presse Med. Beige, 34. Med. Times and Gaz., Sept. 8, i860, p. 247. Henriette states that, having almost completely abandoned this operation, he has lately had reason to place more confidence in it. The chief cause of failure is, he believes, delay. Geriiarut.—On Laryngeal Croup. Tubingen, 1859, pp. 88. N. Y. Journ. Med., March, i860, p. 284.

Med. Journ., July, i860, p. 76. Sturok.—Case of Cardiac Cyanosis, with Remarks. Rigaer Beitr., iv, 2. Canst., vol. iv, p. 12. In Sturok's case a cyanotic individual lived to the age of twenty-one, and died of tuberculosis of the lungs. Concerning the nature of the cyanotic condition of the skin, the author believes, with the majority of authorities, that it depends on the overloading of the peripheric vessels with venous blood; and that it may be produced in two ways, by a de- fective condition of either the heart or the lungs. The mortality in cases of cyanosis is greatest from the period of birth to the age of three years. Those cases live longest, in which the cause of the cyanosis is a patent condition of the foramen ovale only.

In Druitt's case the anus was well formed, but no motions were passed. Amussat's operation was performed without result. After death, which took place in fifty-six hours after birth, the small intestine was found glued together by adhesions at its middle portion; the intestine above was greatly distended.

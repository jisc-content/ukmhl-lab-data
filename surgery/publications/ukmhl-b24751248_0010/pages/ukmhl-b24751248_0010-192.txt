Schmidt's Jahrb., Vol. 105, p. 96. Citella relates a case of religious melancholy with inclination to suicide, which recovered after a fall out of a window about forty feet from the ground. No serious injury was produced by the fall, which was the patient's own act. She was a married woman, set. 32, the mother of four children. Brierre de Boismont.—Statistics of the Asylums for the Insane in France, from 1842 to 1853, according to Legoyl, ike Head of this Department. L'Union 39, 1859. Schmidt's Jahrb., Vol. 105, p. 219. In the year 1835 the number of insane in France was stated at 10,539; in 1851 at 24,253; in 1854 at 24,524. Besides these it was estimated in 1851 that there were no less than 24,433 insane persons who were kept at home, or under private care. The whole total there- fore compared with that of the population gives a ratio of one insane person to every 787 inhabitants. Legoyt is, however, inclined to think that the increase is more apparent than real, and that it is chiefly owing to circumstances which have caused insanity to become more an object of consideration, care, and study. It appears from the report that the class of artizans produces in proportion eight times more insane than that of persons possessed of private property or rentiers. Taking the classes of jurists, clergymen, physicians, professors, and writers, it is found that there is among them, altogether, one insane to every 205, while for the population taken as a whole the proportion is one to 1294. The town population appears to be much more liable to insanity than the rural; but on this, again, Legoyt throws some doubt. The number of idiots in 1853, is stated at 2654; that of cretins at only 45 ; but the latter figure is certainly too low; in the department of " Basses Alpes" alone, the cretins have been estimated at 3000. The yearly average of deaths among the insane is 2675. The mortality of patients admitted into public and private asylums is veiy considerable for the first month, amounting to 108 per 1000. Brierre de Boismont does not ascribe this to the mental effect of the sudden change, and confine- ment, but to the fact that a large number of those who are sent to asylums are in an advanced stage of disease, and beyond all possibility of cure. Besides it often happens that delirious fever patients, or pneumonic, &c, are sent to asylums from a wrong diagnosis. Reports of Nine American Institutions for the Insane. Amer.

Trousseau.—On Sanguineous li/J'usions into the Pleura. Monit. d< k Sc. Med. Nos. 107, 109. Med. T. and G., Nov. 17th. Trousseau states that blood effused in the pleura quickly coagulates, does not act in any notable degree as an irritant, and is quickly absorbed. Wounds of the lung which do not divide any large vessel were found, in experiments on horses, to become speedily obliterated along their track by a fibrinous clot, while the lips of the wound are covered by a fibrinous disc adhering to the pleura. In traumatic effusions into the pleura Trousseau counsels absolute rest and a some- what rigid diet and no interference, except in the case where a violent inflammation has arisen from the simultaneous introduction of blood and air, when paracentesis should at once be performed, and iodine injected. Dutciien thinks the red line on the gums when present an infallible sign of tubercle. It was present in 48 out of 58 cases presenting the physical signs. Lancet, Oct. 8th.

In Pitha's case the thickened mucous membrane was detached to the extent of a square inch from the thyroid and cricoid cartilages, which were necrosed to the same extent.

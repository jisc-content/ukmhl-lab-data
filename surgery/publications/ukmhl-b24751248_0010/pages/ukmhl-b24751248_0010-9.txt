P RE FACE. The present volume:—being the New Sydenham Society's Year-Book' for I860, although of but slightly increased size, contains, in consequence of a smaller type having been employed, a third more matter than its predecessor. The volume differs still farther in the arrangement of the material. The abstracts, where abstracts are given, immediately follow the title or titles of the papers or treatises to which they refer. It has been thought better not to attempt any alphabetical arrangements oT the titles, but to group together those papers which refer to cognate subjects. By this method the reader's con- venience will probably be better served than by any other more arbitrary plan of classification. By reference to the Index the reader will always be able to discover any author's name, or the title of any papei', for which he may be in search. 77, KAHTiKY Street, W*j June, 1861.

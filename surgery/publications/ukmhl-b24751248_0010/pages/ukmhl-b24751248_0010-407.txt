Grandidier.— On Spontaneous or Secondary Umbilical Haemorrhages in Children. Journ. f. Kind., 3 and 6, 1859, p. 380. Schmidt, vol. 105, p. 68. The causes of the spontaneous or secondary umbilical haemorrhages here considered are—1. Too early separation of the cord, before formation of a thrombus in the vessels of the same. 2. Defective cicatrisation of the umbilicus, and formation of small fungous granulations. The author adds twenty-four cases to the 178 collected by Jenkins (' Report on Spontaneous Umbilical Haemorrhage of the Newly-born,' Philadelphia, J838), and has tabulated the whole 202. He is firmly of opinion, that a morbid con- dition of the blood is the chief cause of the haemorrhage. Umbilical haemorrhage is to be regarded as an inferior state of "hamophilie;" but this kind of haemorrhage, at the same time, very rarely happens in "hamophilie." The treatment was very unsuccessful. Better results are to be expected from prophylaxis directed to the condition of the mother during pregnancy. O'Connor.—Hemorrhage from the Navel seventeen days after Birth. Brit. Med.

In forty-six newly-born children the author found that the oral secretion was always alkaline during the first thirty-six or forty-eight hours after birth but that afterwards it was always acid. In infants suffering from thrush he found the secretion of the mouth to be remarkably acid, the norma]

R E P 0 R T ON SPECIAL IEEEAPEUTICS. BY Dr. HANDFIELD JONES, Me. HULKE, AND Dr. GKAIIA" HEWITT. MEDICINE. Mania. (Ann. Med. Psych., 3 ser., v, Jan., 1859.) Schmidt's Jahrb., vol. 105, p. 94.—Legrand du Saulle recommends opium to be ex- hibited in mania in the following manner. The dose is to be gradually increased, commencing with half a grain daily up to six grains, and then is to be omitted. The patient's excitement increases in most cases during the exhibition of the opium ; if calmness is produced, it is an unfavor- able sign. After the drug has been omitted recovery commences, and after some months is complete. During convalescence aphonia is common. The proportion of recoveries under this plan was seven out of ten in acute mania, and three out of twenty in chronic mania of more than one year's standing. In melancholia the treatment was fruitless. Sudor Miliaris. (Gaz. des Hopit.) Ann. par Jamain, i860, p. 7.— Daude gives one or two drops of perchloride of iron every hour from the commencement of the disease, only premising, if necessary, an emetic. The sweating is checked in less than twenty-four hours, the epigastralgia quieted, the paroxysms (of precordial distress and dyspnoea, Ed.) are kept off, and the pulse becomes less open, soft, and yielding. Cholera.—J. 0. Buchheister gives two drops of the Liquor Ferri Sesquichlorati in Asiatic Cholera (Berlin Med. Ztg., No. 41), Canst. Jahrb., vol. iv, p. 69, every half hour, and seltzer water to quench thirst. If reaction set in, no other remedy was required. Convalescence was short (six to twelve days), and interrupted by no secondary affections. Out of forty-five cases there were twenty-nine recoveries, sixteen deaths. Affile.—Hosia. says the double iodide of quinine and iron (Bull, de TheYap., No. 30), Canst. Jahrb., vol. iv, p. 72, is useful in inveterate ague, in early tuberculosis, and in anoemic and cachectic states.

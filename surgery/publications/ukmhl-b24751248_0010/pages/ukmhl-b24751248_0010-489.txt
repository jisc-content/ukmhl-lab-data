479 MEDICAL STATISTICS. improvements in sewerage on the public health in London and other large towns:—"The progress of sanitary measures in London has hitherto resulted in the removal of the impurities from the dwelling-houses into the sewers and the Thames." Thus "the poison is distributed con- veniently along all the lines of road, so as to throw up its vapours into the mouths, throats, and lungs of the people through innumerable gully- holes, which are either untrapped or trapped imperfectly." This arrange- ment the author regards as an apparatus contrived by engineers as if for the very purpose of "passing currents of poisonous airs steadily over.the people of London, with a view to ascertain their exact effects," but thinks that "it is now time that this cruel experiment should cease." He con- siders that the main causes of the insalubrity of London are, in the order of their fatal effect— i, impurities of dwellings ; 2, impurities of streets and gullies ; and 3, impurities of the Thames. In a " Letter to the Eegistrar-General on the Causes of Death in Eng- land," which forms the appendix to the report, that subject is further very fully discussed by Dr. Farr. Sixth Annual Report of the Registrar-General of Births, Deaths, and Marriages in Scotland. Edinburgh, 8vo, 1861. Quarterly Returns of the Marriages, Births, and Deaths registered in the Divisions, Counties, and Districts of England. Nos. 45-48, i860. During the first, or winter quarter, the death-rate of England was slightly above the average, but below the rates of the two previous win- ters ; it was 2*472, as compared with 2*46, the average of the ten pre- ceding winter quarters. During the second quarter the rate of mortality was higher than in any corresponding period of the previous ten years, being 2*228, as compared with 2*195, the average. This is attributed to the ungenial spring season and the clearness of provisions. In the autumn quarter " a reduction of mortality is observable in the town and country districts, but it is by far the greatest in the town districts," in which " the rate of mortality fell from 2*375 *° I-842 per cent. ; in the country and small town districts it fell from 1*759 *° 1 "587." This result is attributed to the low temperature and wet weather, with its consequent better supply of water, purification of sewers, and retardation of putrefaction. During the last three months the death-rate was still low, being 2*024, as com- pared with 2*182, the average. Upon making up the account for the year, the deaths are found to be 422,500, and the annual rate of mortality 2*113, or a little more than 21 in 1000. The average of the preceding ten years is 22, so that one life in every 1000 living was saved. Weekly Tables of the Births, Deaths, and Causes of Death in London during the year i860. The population of Loudon in the middle of the year was estimated to be 2,829,130. During the year 92,825 persons were born, and 61,821 died. The number of deaths per cent, during'the year was 2*193. This may be favorably compared with 2*278, the mean death-rate for the five preceding years, or 2*429, the mean death-rate for the preceding twenty years. The low mortality of the year is specially referred to diarrhoea, the number of deaths from which disease was 1,383, as compared with 3,33 <j the corresponding number for 1859.

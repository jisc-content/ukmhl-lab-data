He made several attempts to propagate the parasite by injecting some of the urine containing it into the bladder of a dog and of a rabbit, but with negative results. Welcker also introduced some of the urine into the stomach of a rabbit, but without any better success, for on killing the animal twelve days afterwards, not a trace of sarcina was detected. The dog was treated much in the same way, and although kept alive for a much longer period—nearly four months—a total absence of the parasite was found. Dr. T. Spencer Cobbold.—Two Memoirs on Entozoa. Trans. Linn. Soc, vol. xxii. The first paper contains notices and descriptions of several new helminths, with microscopical observations, including an account of two experiments in regard to the breeding of Tcenia serrata, and T. cucumerina. The second paper gives an account of several new entozoa, the most interesting form being that of a non-hermaphroditic trematode (Bilharzia magna, Cobbold) from an African monkey (Cercopithecus fuliginosus) ; this worm, both in form and in the possession of a gynsecophoric canal in the male, very closely resembles the Distoma haematobium of Bilharz found in man.

102 REPORT ON THE INSTITUTES OP MEDICINE. Roberta thinks we may look upon the acidity of the urine as a measure of the state of the blood. When the urine is highly acid, the alkalescence of the blood is below par; and when the urine is alkaline, it is an indica- tion that the alkalinity of the blood is above par. In the paper will be found several tables, on the quantity of solids, &c, discharged in the urine per hour, under different kinds of diet and regimen. Planer.—On the Gases of the Urine, and of Exudations. Zeits. d. Wiener Aerzte, No. xxx, Canst., vol. i, p. 243. 1. It would appear from Planer'8 researches that the only gases the urine contains are carbonic acid, nitrogen, and oxygen. The quantity of free carbonic acid varies from forty-five (during fasting) to a hundred parts by volume per thousand (during digestion). The quantity of nitrogen does not vary ; it is about 8 c.c. in 1000 c.c. urine. Oxygen is found in such minute quantity (0.6 per 1000) that it probably accidentally enters during the process of collecting the urine, notwithstanding the greatest possible care being taken to avoid any such occurrence. 2. As regards the quantity of combined carbonic acid, it seems that it increases during digestion to about double its amount in the period of fasting. 3. After taking bitartrate of potash, the quantity of free carbonic acid in the urine is greatly increased—nearly threefold, whereas the quantity of the combined acid is not increased ; it even appears sometimes to be diminished ; the diminution is, however, most probably only relative, as the amount of urine passed is much greater. In fever, the urine contains an excess of both free and combined car- bonic acid. In a case of albuminuria, the urine contained about the normal amount of carbonic acid; while in a case of polyuria, three times as much free carbonic acid, and twice as much combined acid, was found than exists in normal urine of the same specific gravity. In 1000 c.c. (61.027 cuhic inches) of fluid drawn from the abdomen of a patient suffering from diseased liver, 116.7 c.c. of free gas were obtained, which on analysis yielded— c.c. Equal to in 100 parts. Carbonic acid . . 95.22 81.62 per cent. Nitrogen . . . 21.07 18.06 „ Oxygen . . .0.14 0.12 „ The exudation from a serous cavity is thus seen to contain the same gases, and the carbonic acid and nitrogen in nearly the same relative pro- portions, as normal urine.

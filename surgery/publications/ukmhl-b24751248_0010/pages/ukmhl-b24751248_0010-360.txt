^50 REPORT ON MIDWIFERY, ETC. for an hour after delivery ; 8, to imply the child to the breast before leaving the house; p, to enjoin perfect quiet and exclusion of visitors- 10, it haemorrhage is anticipated, to give ergot as the head is passing the pennreum. 1 b Dr. W. Newman.—The Management of the Placenta. Brit. Med. Journ May 12, i860, p. 356. Immediately after the expulsion of the child, pressure is made on the uterus by means of the hand, and the pressure maintained until the uterus is reduced m bulk, and the coagula, together with the placenta, are expelled. The due contraction of the uterus is thus ensured, together with the expulsion of coagula ; and post-partum haemorrhage and hour-glass contraction are prevented.

Martin.—On the Transfusion of Blood in cases of Post-Partum Hemorrhage. Berlin, Hirschwald, 8vo, pp. 91. Schmidt, vol. 106, P- 354- The author relates a case, observed by himself, in which the transfusion was successful. He gives a tabular account of fifty-seven cases of transfusion in recently delivered women, of whom forty-five recovered. In the oiher twelve cases, the death occurred from diseases in no way connected with the operation. The author does not follow the plan suggested by Mfiller, of de- priving the blood of its fibrin by means of whipping. Indications for the operation are extreme anaemia, whiteness of the skin, cold extremities, small, hardly to be detected pulse, faintness, unre- strainable vomiting ; when these are present, the time for the operation has arrived. The apparatus to be used is as simple as possible. A smal" curved canula and trochar to open the veins, and through which to inject the blood, and a small 2-oz. glass syringe, are the instruments requited. The canula has a funnel-shaped mouth, covered with caoutchouc, to receive the blood. The injection must be effected slowly. The blood to be used, is that of a healthy man or of a healthy non-excitable woman. Rupture and Laceration of the Uterus. Paulli.— Cases of Rupture of the Uterus. Bibl. for Lseger, vol. xiii, 215.

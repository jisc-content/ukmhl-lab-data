Effusion Fig. 408.* Fia. 409. t Fig. ilO.X of fluid within the joint takes place to a moderate amount, and is eventually ab- sorbed. But the membrane itself remains thickened and fibrous; while osteophytes or osseous deposits frequently form partly in its substance, principally around the joint, connected with the periosteum and articular ends of the bones. (Fig. 409.) These ossific forma- tions are nodular, and have a denser or more compact structure; unlike the long and spiculated, stalactitic osteophytes, and of a porous or more cancellated structure, which result from either periosteal or osteal inflam- mation. Hence the term nodosity of the joints, proposed by Dr. Haygarth, as express- ing one of the most distinctive features of chronic rheumatic synovitis or arthritis. The ligaments become relaxed; the articular car- tilages undergo peculiar changes ; becoming fibrous and having a yellowish hue, nodular, and then rough, ultimately being destroyed, and presenting patches of ivory-like bony material or porcellanous deposit, white, smooth, and glistening. This acquires even a high polish under the attrition of the surfaces, and linear furrows are formed in the directions of friction by the movements of the joint. * St. Thomas's Hosp. Miis., D. 100'.

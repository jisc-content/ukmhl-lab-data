SPECIAL PATHOLOGY AND SUEGERY. 552 _ Branches-The peroneal, almost equal in size to the posterior tibial arises about one inch and a half below the border of the poplitens Fig. 171 * muscle, where the posterior tibial nerve crosses the artery to the outer side ; passing onwards between the muscles to the fibula, it descends somewhat under cover of that bone and in the fibres of the flexor pollicis, to the aperture below the interosseous membrane; there send- ing a branch forwards, and another between the tibia and fibula to the outer side of the foot. Other branches of the posterior tibial are of smaller size; some are muscular in the course of the artery, and an anastomotic Fig. 172. communicating brancli passes outwards across the lower end of the tibia. Operation.—High up, under cover of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles, the posterior tibial may be reached by a free incision between the margin of the tibia and the gastrocnemius. (Fig. 172.) This incision must be continued down to the tibial origin of the soleus, which is then to be divided; both these muscles are drawn back, aided by flexure of the leg and extension of the foot to relax the muscles; the artery with its vense comites will thus be found, and the nerve to * Posterior Tibial Artery.—A, popliteus muscle; B, outer portion of soleus, cut ; c, inner portion, cut; d, tibialis posticus ; e, flexor digitorum ; f, flexor pollicis ; G, peroneus longus; h, peroneus brevis ; i, tendo Achillis ; a, popliteal artery; band' c, articular branches; d, anterior tibial artery; e, posterior tibial artery, and /, its communicating branch to the peroneal artery; g, peroneal; h, continuation of the peroneal to the outside of the foot. 1.

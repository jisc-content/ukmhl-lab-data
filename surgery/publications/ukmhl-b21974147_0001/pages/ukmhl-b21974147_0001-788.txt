764 SPECIAL PATHOLOGY AND SURGERY. ^ Signs.â€”(1.) Dislocation on the dorsum iljd presents very cliaracter- istic appearances. The limb is shortened to an extent varying from one inch and a half as the average, to three inches occasionally; the knee is slightly flexed, and the thigh upon the abdomen, thus proiectina the knee forwards; there is marked inversion of the limb, the knee being directed inwards, as well as forwards, towards the other, and ]ust above it; the foot also is inverted, so that the great toe rests on the opposite ankle. (Pig. .375.) The head of the femur in its new situan tion, with the gluteal muscles, give an unnatural prominence to the posterior aspect of the buttock, and the bone can he felt, especially on rotating the limb ; the prominence of the great trochanter is diminished and drawn upwards and turned forwards near the anterior superioi spinous process of the ilium. Immobility of the limb, at least in tht direction of eversion, abduction, and extension, will be more or les complete, and the patient has lost the power of such voluntary motion Fig. 375. Fig. 376. great pain also attends almost any movement of the limb. (2.) Dislo cation into the great sciatic notch presents similar signs, but in a lessei degree; thns fendering the characteristic appearances less marked Shortening has taken place to an extent usually of half an inch, and not exceeding an inch. Flexion and inversion are such, that the axis of the dislocated thigh points the knee less across the opposite thigh, and the end of the great toe rests on the ball of the great toe opposite (Fig. 376.) The hip appearances are less conspicuous; the head of the femur sinking into the hollow of the notch, "where, however, it can be felt in a thin subject, or by introducing the finger into the rectum oi vagina, and the great trochanter approaches less nearly to the anterioi

Fig. 32.* Situation.—Cystic growths—originating from the erring develop- ment of cells or nuclei—may occur in any texture or organ, but most frequently in the kidney, thyroid gland, mammary gland, choroid plexus, chorion; in the neck, gums, about the sheaths of tendons at the wrist, —forming ganglions; and about the epididymis, as seminal cysts, encysted hydroceles, or hydroceles of the spermatic cord. Cysts having this origin are single, or numerous, in the same organ or part. Origin.—Of Simple or barren cysts: the serous date from birth or earliest childhood, as by transformations of nsevi; or from puberty or later life, as an ovarian tumour by enlargement of Graafian vesicles; or from perhaps still later li:^^, as mammary cysts which begin during r>r after the time of natural degeneracy of the milk-glands. Of Proliferous cysts: the cutaneous which occur in or near the orbit, are congenital; whereas those which, as wens, occur in the scalp, are not congenital. They are, however, hereditary, though unconnected with any constitu- tional tendency. * Cystic tumour of the femur. (After Pean.)

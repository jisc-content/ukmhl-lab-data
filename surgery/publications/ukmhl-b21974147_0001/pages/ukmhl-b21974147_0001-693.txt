FEACTURES OF THE LEG. 660 tlie leo-, will secure the whole in position. Fracture, very oblique, or commintited, may occasion some difficulty as to the retention of the frao-ments in apposition. It is here that division of the tendo-Achillis —Laugier's proposal—seems a justifiable procedure, with the view of correcting the displacement arising from muscular contraction. This resource certainly proved effectual in one case under my care, where the tibia was broken just above the ankle-joint, attended with marked retraction of the foot, and threatened protrusion of the upper end of the fracture. Erichsen divided the tendon, apparently with less success, in two cases. (2.) Fbactures of the Lower Ends of the Tibia and Eibula, or of EITHER Bone Singly.—Structural Gonditions.—Five forms of fracture Fig. 281.* Fig. 2S2.t are liable to occur near the ankle-joint:—(1) fracture of the articular end of the tibia, obliquely from without downwards and inwards ; and of the fibula about three inches above the ankle (Fig. 281); (2) fracture of the fibula about three inches above the ankle, Avith the tip of the internal malleolus of the tibia, this double fracture constituting Pott's Fracture, a very common form (Fig. 282) ; (3) fracture of the fibula two to three inches above the external malleolus, with rupture of the internal lateral or deltoid ligament; (4) fracture of the internal mal- leolus of the tibia; (5) fracture involving the ankle-joint. (Fig. 283.) Displacement in these fractures varies: in fracture of the Tibia and Fibula, the upper fragment of the Tibia usually projects inwards, * St. Bartholomew's Hospital Mnsoum, C. 18. t Ibid.

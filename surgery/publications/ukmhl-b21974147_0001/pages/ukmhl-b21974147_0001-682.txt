SPECIAL PATHOLOGY AND SURGERY. 658 direction of fracture is, generally, transverse (Fig. 265) ; or either condyle may be detached, thus resembling fractures of the Lower Articular ]^nd of the Humerus. These fractures also involve, or extend into, the knee-joint. (Fig. 266.) Displacement of the lower fragment backwards is produced by the action of the gastrocnemius muscle. Separation of the lower epiphysis has occasionally been met with, as verified by dissection. (Fig. 267.) The Signs are, usually, clearly perceptible; some deformity corre- sponding to the displacement, mobility, and crepitus ; pain, and loss of power in proportion to the displacement. Impacted fracture in this situation is liable to occur. Erichsen states that he has had several such cases xinder his care. In one, Fig. 265.* Fig. 2C7.1 Fig. 266.t the upper fragment, which was very oblique, was firmly driven into the cancellous structure of the lower one. In another case, the condyles of both thigh-bones were splintered or comminuted into a number of frag- ments, amongst which the shafts were impacted. Causes.â€”Indirect violence, as by a fall on the feet, may detach the epiphysis, transversely from the shaft, in childhood or youth. Direct violence, as by a fall on the knee, or kick of a horse, may fracture either condyle. * St. Bartholomew's Hosp. Mus., C. 58.

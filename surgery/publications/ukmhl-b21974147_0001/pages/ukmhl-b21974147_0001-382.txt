A Wound is a solution or breach of continuity of the soft tissues, sud- denly produced, in any part of the body, and by some direct external mechanical cause. Such lesion may be effected by various instruments of a cutting, tearing, or iDuncturing character. Hence, Wounds are commonly distinguished as Incised, Contused and Lacerated, and Punc- tured. Grunshot Wounds are also contused and lacei'ated. Poisoned Wound is characterized, not by the nature, and still less by the extent, of the lesion itself, which may be only a slight puncture; but, by the accompanying introduction of some poisonous matter, whereby the constitutional disturbance becomes of far greater consequence than the local lesion. Such are stings of bees, wasps^, hornets ; snake-bites ; bites of rabid animals, giving rise to hydrophobia; and dissection- wounds. Excluding, therefore, poisoned wounds; Wounds differ most signi- ficantly in their relation to the laws of Reparation. Incised wound has a natural tendency to undergo rejDair, or to heal, by primary adhesion, when its surfaces are placed in contact; all other wounds, in proportion as they are contused or lacerated, have a natural tendency to sloughing and then to undergo repair by the slower process, on an open surface, of suppurative granulation and cicatrization. Incised Wound. An Incised Wound is a solution of continuity of the soft textures ; suddenly produced, and with even division of the tissues. The former character distinguishes this lesion from a breach resulting from ulcera- tion ; the latter character defines it from a contused wound.

779 DISLOCATIONS OF THE KNEE-JOINT. of the leg and proportionate loss of extensor power, tlio leg hanging down nearly useless and swinging to and fro like a pendulum. The Treatment is the same as for fractured patella or rupturo of tho quadriceps tendon. In the case referred to, the power of extension was but partially recovered. Dislocations of the Knee.—This joint is seldon dislocated; never- theless, the head of the tibia is liable to undergo dislocation in four principal directions, and in the following order of relative frequency : (1) inwards, (2) outwards, (3) forwards, (4<) backwards. The first two dislocations are FiQ- o93.* always incomplete, with one or two very rare exceptions; the latter two dislocations may be incomplete or complete. Velpeau has found on record thirteen examples of complete dislocation forwards, and eight backwards. Structural Conditions.—(1.) Dislocation of the tibia laterally, outwards (Fig. 393) ; the external condyle of the tibia rests upon the internal condyle of the femur, and the lateral ligaments are more or less completely ruptured. (2.) Dislocation laterally, in- icards ; the internal condyle of the tibia rests npon the external condyle of the femur, and the lateral ligaments are more or less entirely ruptured. (3.) Dislocation of the head of the tibia, forwards ; the head is situated partly, or en- tirely, in front of the condyles of the femur, according as the dislocation is incomplete or complete. The condyles of the femur project, proportionately, back- wards in the popliteal space. (Fig. 394.) Fig. 395.t Fig. 394.t * Guy's Hosp. Mus., 1345''".

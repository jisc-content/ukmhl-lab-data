148 GENERAL PATHOLOGY AND SURGERY. Lastly, associated with other growths, fo growths, tumours. Myeloid tumour is allied to the fibrous by virtue of one structural rminsr O mixed Fig, 48.* element, the fibre-cell, and to the ordinary cartilagi- nous tumour by its more abundant many-nucleated corpuscles. (Fig. 48.) These corpuscles and im- perfect fibres appear to be identical with those of healthy rudimentary bone. Hence, the marrow-like as so designated by Paget, has also been namedTbltp^^c''^^^^^^^^^^^^^ strinJnt'frotS^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^ - The external characters of the myeloid variety of cartilaginous j,^^ tumour are tolerably definite. (Fig. '* 49.) Its surface is more or less lobulated. If enclosed within bone, its shape is uniform and spheroidal; if seated on the surface of a bone, its outline is irregular, as seen in epulis. The fleshy, inelastic firm- ness of a myeloid growth is re- markable, although its consistence varies. On section, the surface pre- sents a greyish-white basis colour, daubed with irregular blotches of a bright red, livid or brownish tint. This blotched appearance is unconnected with any correspond- ing vascularity, the supply of blood- vessels being scanty even when the tumour is most ruddy. The cut surface is also succulent, and exudes a yellowish fluid. Situation.—Myeloid tumour selects bone more frequently than any other tissue. Paget has seen this growth in the mammary gland, and probably also in the neck near the thyroid gland. Origin.—The tumour begins very rarely in early life, or in old age; most frequently between youth and middle age. It is seldom referable to inheritance, defective health, or injury. Course.—The rate of growth is usually slow. Myeloid tumour is not apt to ulcerate or protrude like a recurrent fibroid growth; but it is liable, if not prone, to return when extirpated by the knife, thus differing essentially in its vital career from the typical form of cartila- ginous tumour. * Elemental cells of myeloid tumour.—a.

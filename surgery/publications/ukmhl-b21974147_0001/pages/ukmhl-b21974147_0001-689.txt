FRACTURES OF THE LEG. 665 Fig. 273 * Fig. 274.t distinction not observed by Dr. Gr. Boucbard, of Paris, who bad pre- viously written a valuable paper on tbis injury. Of tbe 69 unco77ipUcated fractures, tbe results were as follow:— In 8 cases of fracture, with incised wound, tbe recoveries were 5 without anchylosis, 1 with complete anchylosis; and the deaths 2, no operation having been performed. In 40 cases, with lacerated wound, the recoveries were 10 without anchylosis, 6 with partial and 11 with complete anchylosis, in 1 tbe condition was uncertain, and 4 were submitted to secondary amputation; tbe deaths were 8 without any operation, and 1 after secondary amputation. In 21 cases, with gunshot wound, the recoveries were 3 without anchy- losis, 3 with partial and 7 with complete anchylosis, in 4 the condition was uncertain, and 1 was submitted to secondary excision; the deaths were I without any operation, and 2 after primary excision, by removal of tbe shattered patella. Of tbe 16 cases of fracture, covi- plicated with fracture of the other bones of the joint, tbe recoveries were 2 without anchylosis, 2 with partial and 2 with complete anchylosis, and 1 was sub- mitted to primary excision, 2 to secondary excision—1 being the removal of a ball from tbe bead of tbe fibula—and 1 underwent primary amputa- tion ; the deaths were 1 with- out any operation, 1 after primary excision, 3 after secondary excision, and 1 after secondary amputation. Thus, in the total number of 85 cases, tbe recoveries were 65 : 20 without anchylosis ; 10 with partial, and 21 with complete anchylosis; in 5 tbe condition was uncertain; after excision, primary, 1; secon- dary, 3; after amputation, primary, 1; secondary, 4. The deaths were 20 : 12 without any operation; after excision, primary, 3; secondary, 3 ; after amputa- tion, secondary, 2. The total relative mortality was less than 1 in 4, Feactuebs of the Leg.—(1.) Peactuee of the Tibia and Pibula, oe of eithbe Bone singly.— Structural Conditions.—(Pig- 273.) The direction of fracture is usually transverse in the upper part of these bones, especially the tibia (Pig. 274); or it may be comminuted, and extend into the * Fractures of Tibia and Fibula.—Diagi-am sbowing situations and lines of frac- ture; chiefly from specimens in the Museum of St. Bartholomew's Hospital.— Tibia.—1. Head, comminuted into knee-joint (St. George's Mus., 1, 199). 2. Below head (Univ. Coll. Mus., 255). 3. Upper third. 4. Middle third. 5. Lower third, and below head of fibula. G. Above ankle-joint, and the .same in fibula. 7. Internal malleolus, and lower end of fibula, or Pott's fracture. 8. Lower end of tibia, into ankle-joint (St. Bart. Mus., C. 22). Fibula.—5,0, 7, as in tibia. (Author ) t Univ. Coll. Mus., 255.

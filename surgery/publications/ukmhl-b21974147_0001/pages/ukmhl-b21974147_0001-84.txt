GENERAL PATHOLOGY AND SURGERY. 60 invariably; thjs depends upon the strengtli of the heart and the force of its conti'actions." " The other extreme of tension is gauged by the dicrotic wave, the size to which it is developed, the shortness of the line c D (Fig. 12i), or its entire absence; the pulse being fully or hyperdicrotic. (Fig. 10b, c.) In addition to this, the percussion wave is generally absent, and the collapse of the tidal wave sudden, the angle formed by the upstroke and downstroke being very acute. This sudden collapse is due to the emptying of the artery being sudden and not gradual. (a.) High. Fig. 13.â€”Variations in Arterial Tension. Chronic Bright's disease. Pr. 5 oz. (h.) Medium. Normal.

"The degrees of tension which are commonly met with are very various; four types may be givenThe extreme high tension of Bright's disease (Fig. Ua) ; the medium or normal tension of a healthy pulse of good tone (Fig. 136) ; the low tension oiten found in healthy persons, with bad tone and relaxed vessels (lig. 13c); the extremely low tension of the hyperdicrotic pulse of fever (tig. 13rf). To these might be added the pulse of empty arteries, as m free aortic ""^^^From this consideration of the pulse in general, let us return to that of Inflammatory fever, which is of considerable interest and affords valuable assistance in the prognosis and treatment of the case. In simple inflammatory fever of the sthenic type, although the tempera- ture may be high, the pulse is one of rather high tension; this is also the case with erysipelas in some cases, and these are generally of a mild

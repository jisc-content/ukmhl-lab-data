INFLAMMATION. 57 " To return to tlie degrees of dicrotism. If the dicrotic notch C is well marked, but its lowest point does not reach the respiratory line, the pulse is called ' dicrotic,' or sometimes hypodicrotic, but this term tends to confusion (Fig. 10a) ; if the notch c reaches to the level of the respiratory line A B, the pulse is called fully dicrotic (Fig. 105); lastly, if the notch C sinks below the level of the line A B,°it is then called ' hyperdicrotio' (Fig. lOo). Fig. 11.—Extreme Developments of each "Wave. (a.) Exaggerated percussion. (6.) Ditto. (c.) Exaggerated dicrotic. (c?.) Exaggerated tidal. (e.) Ditto. A = Percussion, b = Tidal, o = Dicrotic. "Briefly, then, the Percussion wave is due to shock or sudden impulse, and is produced by sudden and forcible contraction of the heart. It may occur in a very exaggerated degree and form the^ most striking feature in the tracing (Fig. lla), owing to an excited action of the heart; or it may be transmitted much more rapidly than the tidal wave, so that the two become distinctly separated

DISLOCATIONS OF THE HIP-JOINT. 775 * After Biffclow. variety of dislocation into the great ischiatic notch. Bat the attitude of the limb is peculiar. It is marked by great flexion and adduction, with inversion, so that the thigh lies across the opposite thigh (Fig. 389) ; and the head of the bone may be felt just above the tuberosity of the ischium, at the back part of the hip. The reduction is most readily brought about by a manipulative pro- cedure : flex the thigh to a right angle with the pelvis, abduct, rotate inwards, and then bring down the knee; thus, in fact, retracing the altered position of the limb.

Subcotyloid dislocation will also be recognized by the peculiar position of the limb; vertical flexion of the thigh to a right angle with the pelvis, and with- FiG. 390.* Fig. 389.* out any notable adduction or abduction, inversion or eversion. (Fig. 390). This downward luxation may be considered as related to the typical form of thyroid dislocation. Two cases are recorded by Mr. Edwin Gurney (Lancet, 1845). A similar mode of manijpulation to that in the last case, will probably succeed in returning the head of the femur into the acetabulum. (c.) Forwards and downwards, upon the ramus of the ischium, or into the perineum. Another form of thyroid dislocation, the attitude J'is. 391.* of the limb differs characteristic- ally from that in the vertical dislocation. The thigh, somewhat flexed upon the pelvis, is in a state of extreme abduction and eversion ; and the ball of the femur may be felt on the ischiatic ramus, or presents a tumoar in the perineum. (Fig. 391.) An instance of this very rare form of luxation is recorded in tho "Path. Trans. Lond." vol. x. Reduction may be performed, as in tho case referred to, by exten- sion of the thigh downwards from the pelvis, with traction from tho

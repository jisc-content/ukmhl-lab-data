TUMOURS OR MORBID GROWTHS. 139 it is a very indefinite term—Sarcoma (aapi, flesh) implying only the physical character of fleshiness, and thus associating tumours other- wise widely different. Billroth himself acknowledges that they possess a very diverse histological structure—round-celled, spindle-celled, giant-celled, net-celled, alveolar, and pigmentary; further, that their vital or clinical course is widely diverse, comprising local or innocent tumours, recurring, and systemically infectious growths; and that there is no correspondence between the histological structure of sar- comatous tumours, and their clinical course. Fibro-cellular tumour may be taken as the type of Sarcoma. As a tumour it is distinguished from polypus, mucous or cutaneous, chiefly by its relation to the adjoining texture. Both are over-growths ; but, while polypus is merely an out-growth of fibro-cellular tissue, the same structure, as a tumour, is distinctly isolated by a capsular investment. Structural Condition and Diagnostic Characters.—The mass, thus detached, is roundish, and of tolerably regular outline, usually deeply and largely lobed. Its chief physical character is a remarkably elastic Fig. 36.* tension, due to the structural resemblance of this tumour to dropsical cellular tissue, circumscribed. It may grow to great size and weight, perhaps forty pounds. Section shows a yellow surface, marked with white lines, which have an undulatory direction across the tumour, and may divide its substance into distinct lobes. (Pig. 36. Yirchow.)

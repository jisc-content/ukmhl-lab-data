INFLAMMATION. 43 where, as compared with their natural condition, before irritation (Fig. 1), the vessels have become dilated to nearly twice their diameter, and many more have become visible within the area of the focus of irritation. (Fig. 2.) Fig. 1.* Fig. 2* Fig. 3.t The vessels having undergone dilatation, they may become saccu- lated, lengthened, and tortuous, as the result of their weakened and inelastic state from over-irritation, in an advanced stage of inflammation (Fig. 3) ; and the blood contained in the vessels undergoes certain changes, the red cor- puscles being impacted, accompanied with an increased production, apparently, of the pale corpuscles, which also appear to be more adhesive, and cling to the sides of the vessels. The capillary cir- culation of a warm-blooded animal, as in the bat's wing, when thus subjected to irritation, does not exhibit any in- creased proportion of white corpuscles, according to the observations of Wharton Jones and Paget; and in the frog, that condition may be due to an unhealthy state of this animal. Dr. Williams' ori- ginal description has more recently been confirmed essentially by Dr. Burdon Sanderson, and other observers ; —that, in inflammation, the vascular phenomena consist of "increased activity of the capillary circulation in the affected part, followed by diminished circulation ; " or conversely, that the vessels may become contracted, in the first instance, followed by dilatation; this difference depending on the kind of irritant employed, as a solution of ammonia, while a solution of caustic soda produces dilatation succeeded by con- traction, and croton oil seems to have a variable effect on the vessels, sometimes producing the one, sometimes the other. The leading vascular change in inflammation—acceleration of the capillary circulation-—is referable to an impression received by the cen- (Wharton Jones.) t (Paget.)

TALIPES OR CLUB-FOOT. 845 * Talipes calcaneus—non-congenital, in the adult. (After W. Adams.) but tlie deformity is simply symptomatic of muscular contraction; the muscles engaged being the four whose tendons pass between the two malleoli, anteriorly—the tibialis anticus, extensor pollicis, extensor longus digitorum, and peroneus tertius, a part of the last-named muscle. The lateral ligaments, in their posterior portions, are much elongated. This form of talipes is very rare, and was first described by Dr. Little, in the case of a child, four and a half years of age. It Fig. 470.* Fig. 471. Fig. 472. is congenital. Or, the heel may drop, from paralysis of the muscles of the calf of the leg —the gastrocnemius and soleus ; and the plantar arch become contracted, partly by shortening of the plantar fascia, with con- traction of the flexor muscles of the foot, which thus completes the arching of the sole downwards. (Fig. 470. ) This form of calcaneus is ac- quired, and especially when the plantar fascia is involved in producing the deformity. The treatment is much facilitated by the absence of any structural im- pediments. Reduction can be easily accomplished by flexion alone, with support of the heel, or aided by teno- tomy ; and the foot is readily retained in position. The best form of instru- ment, or shoe, for treatment mechanic- ally, in order to restore the normal position and actions of the foot, is that shown in the annexed figure. (Fig. 471. ) Bigg's apparatus is well adapted for cases of the second form, and of great severity. (Fig. 472.) Varieties of OZM6-/ooi.—Combinations of the typical forms of club- foot are met with. They have already been adverted to ; but, to simplify the descriptions given, it was desirable not to introduce these varieties in connection with their respective types.

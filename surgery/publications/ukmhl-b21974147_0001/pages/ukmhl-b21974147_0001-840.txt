Diseases op the Hip-Joint.—The hip-joint is liable to the same inflammatory diseases as other joints, affecting its component structures: synovitis, scrofulous caries, and ulceration of the articular cartilages. The second-named disease presents characters worthy of a separate description. Scrofulous Disease of the Hip, or Morbus Coxarius.—Structural Conditions.—This disease commences in the cancellous tissue of the head of ihe femur, or of the acetabulum; possibly, in both bones simultane- ously. It may also commence in the synovial membrane, as scrofulous synovitis; or, it is said, in the round ligament. Hence the name scrofulous disease of the hip, as a general term including these different seats of origin. In scrofulous caries of the hip, the cancellous tissue undergoes the Fig. 429. Fig. 430.t structural alterations described in connection with this disease of Bone; briefly, increased vascularity, softening, deposition of a reddish fluid in the enlarged cancelli, followed by a yellowish opaque tubercular matter. Fig. 43LJ Subsequent structural alterations are as follow :—The articular cartilages become involved and disappear, more or less completely ; and abscess forms within the cavity of the joint. The affected portions of bone become re- markably changed in shape and size. The liead of the femur—bared, per- haps, of cartilage, and the open cancel- lous tissue exposed—is flattened and, expanded, mushroom-like in form onj the neck of the bone (Fig. 429) ; and the nech itself, sharing in the disease, may be so reduced as to leave nothingi more than a slight nodular vestige, ifJ any remnant, of the diseased bone pro-1 jecting from the great trochanter.

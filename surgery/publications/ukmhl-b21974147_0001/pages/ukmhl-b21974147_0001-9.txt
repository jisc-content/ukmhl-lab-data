I. 6 PEEFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION. In offering to the Profession a new edition of this work, I have endeavoured to render it a more trustworthy and complete repre- sentation of Sm-gery, in its widest acceptation; although within the limits of a compendious Text-book.

Accordingly, the whole of the Text has been thoroughly revised, or in many parts rewritten; and a large amount of new matter is introduced, extending to five hundred and thirty-two pages beyond the previous editionâ€”exclusive of Index. Not a chapter, and scarcely even a page, has been left without some such alteration or addition, conformably with the state of Surgery, both in its Science and Practice. So general and important are these changes throughout, that the present edition may be rgarded as a new work. Pursuing the original design of this Surgery, I have sought to supply a sound and enlarged exposition of Pathology, in the various forms of Injury and Disease, respecting also their diagnosis, their causes, courses, and prognosis; with a full con- sideration of their Treatment, as derived from all this pathological knowledge, and supplemented by the resources of experience- especially in regard to the appropriate Surgical Operations and Manipulations, the plan and performance of which are carefully described in detail. The various kinds of Surgical Apparatus are noticed, and their modes of application explained,

SPECIAL PATHOLOGY AND SURGERY. 844 Fig. 467.* childhood, or a paralytic condition of their opponent tibial musclcB as a sequel of infantile paralysis. Occasionally, valgus is the result of injury, as from the cicatricial con- traction of a burn; and sometimes it is consequent on disease of the ankle-joint. This deformity may be congenital, but far more often it is acquired. Flat-foot is said to arise, in young persons, from long-continued standing or walking. I have seen it commence in girls who have sud- denly become stout and heavy, about the age of puberty; the arch of the foot and inner ankle then giving way. The treatment of talipes valgus must be conducted on the principles already laid down in the other forms of club-foot. Tenotomy will generally be necessary; and the tendons to be divided are those of the peronei muscles, about an inch above the outer malleolus ; and possibly also the extensor communis digitorum, in front of the ankle-joint. The foot is afterwards placed in a Scarpa's shoe. The best form of instrument is that devised by Dr. Langaard, of Hamburg. (Fig. 468.) It is provided with a tangential ankle-screw. Slight deformity of this kind can sometimes be corrected by ex- tension, under the influence of chloroform; and subsequently wearing the shoe. Flat-foot is amenable to the same plan of treatment, with the addi- tion of a convex sole to restore and support the arch of the foot. Fig. 468. Fig. 469.t (4.)

424 SPECIAL PATHOLOGY AND SURGERY. parts, and ultimately producing strange deformity. Thus, remarkable distortions of the face and neck (Fig. 102), or of the joints, are produced- and numerous remarkable deformities in all other parts of the body have not unf requently been met with. Tetcmus, pysemia, erysipelas, and other affections may be omitted in estimating the causes of death as from burn; they being, rather, acci- dental concomitants. Fig. 102. The period of death varies. The most fatal period is, perhaps, the first week after the accident. Erichsen found that in 50 fatal cases, 33 terminated before the eighth day ; 27 of these dying before the fourth day. Of the remaining 17 cases, 8 died in the second week, 2 in the third, 2 in the fourth, 4 in the fifth, and 1 in the sixth week. Prognosis.—The chief considerations which determine the prognosis of burns and scalds, are the more or less superficial character of the lesion and its extent, its situation, duration of the cause, and the age of the patient. The first two of these indications were sufficiently noticed in connection with diagnosis ; a superficial but extensive burn is far more unfavourable than a deeper and limited one. Hence, many scalds are more fatal than burns. These indications, however, have reference to death principally by shock or congestion, in the first period, after burn; or by reaction and inflammation, in the second period. The dejyth of a burn—as compared with a scald—is significant with reference to suppuration and exhaustion, terminating fatally, in the third period. Deep burns are also unpropitious with regard to the part affected; distortion and loss of function supervening. The situation of a burn more especially indicates the probability of visceral congestion. Thus, burns on the chest or abdomen are especially dangerous, in relation to congestion of the lungs or gastro- intestinal mucous membrane, respectively. Burns of the scalp are not

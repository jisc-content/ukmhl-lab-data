51 INFLAMMATION. the heart's action becomes quiet; the nervous system is no longer restless; the look of trouble passes from the countenance; and the patient can again take solid food. On Temperature in Disease, and the Clinical Thermometer.—In the process of Inflammation, the generation of heat may be termed a "product," just as the collection of lymph and white blood-cells, whether known as effusion or suppui*ation, are also products ; accruing from those textural changes, involving the blood, which constitute a localized acceleration of nutrition, and which, in the increased produc- tion of heat, is still not inaptly designated Inflammation. But this increased production of heat in the part, becomes a more exact sign of the degree of inflammation, in proportion as any rise of temperature can be accurately measured. Then again, heat from the part, passing by successive increments into the blood in circulation, and thence raising the temperature of the whole body, is assuredly the most essen- tial element of inflammatory fever. Yet here also, the value of this element, as a symptom of the degree or intensity of the fever, must be estimated by measurement. And in febrile conditions generally, not to mention most other forms of disease or injury, the temperature of the part or of the body has become a cardinal consideration.

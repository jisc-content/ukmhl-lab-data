75 INFLAMMATION. (2.) Cells or corpuscles appear in coagulable lymph, and are found interspersed among the molecular formed filaments, in coagulated lymph. These cells contain each from three to eight granules, the diameter Fig. 17.* of which equals that of the filaments. The cells themselves range in size from to rooT) of an inch, (^'ig- 17.) They have been named plastic by Dr. Bennett, because occurring so often in plastic lymph; and also named pyoid by Lebert, from their general resem- blance to pus corpuscles. But neither water nor acetic acid much alfect these plastic cells. Most probably, they are altered white corpuscles of the blood, which have emigrated. Cells of this kind undergo development. By elongation, they assume an oat-shape; prolonged yet further in opposite directions, they are attenuated into filaments,â€”forming fibre-cells. Thence is produced fihro-cellular, or connective, tissue, generally the highest state of organization of inflammatory efi^usion. (Fig. 18.) Pig. 18. Blood-vessels are found in organized inflammatory lymph, and possibly in coagulated lymph, but they do not appear to be formed m it; they project into the new tissue from the structure on, or in, which it is placed. The vessels are formed by the same process of sprouting, coalescence, and construction of loops, as in granulations. Lymphatics were discovered by Schroeder Van der Kolk in false mem- braues. Nerves have been twice seen by Virchow in adhesions; one of the pleura; the other of the peritoneum, between the liver and diaphragm. False Membranes are formed on the inner or free surface of serous and oE mucous membranes ; as in pleurisy, pericarditis, and peritonitis ; m croup, and dysentery. Such membranes consist of inflammatory * ^lolecular fibres and plastic corpuscles, in simple exudation on a serous sunace. Above are corpuscles after the action of acetic acid. 250 diam. (Bennett.)

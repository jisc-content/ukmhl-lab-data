SCROFULOUS DISEASE OF THE JOINTS. 809 t After Kedfcrn. St. Bartholomew's Hosp. Mus., 2, 6. Fig. 423.* involved, and the cancellous tissue acquires undue vascularity. The articular lamella of bone—a layer of calcified cartilage—crumbles or breaks up in masses, carrying with it portions of cartilage; and the granulations springing from the exposed cancellous tissue unite with those of the synovial membrane. Ulceration consequent on disease of the subjacent hone consists in degeneration, followed usually by inflam- matory ulceration. A portion of the carti- lage, losing its nutrient supply, degenerates or perishes, and is detached with its arti- cular lamella from the inflamed surface of bone—as from the articular surface of the head of the tibia, a section of which is here shown (Fig. 423)—whilst the surrounding portions of cartilage undergo the changes described as taking place in ulceration from synovitis. The minute changes in the process of ulceration relate both to the cartilage-corpuscles and the inter-cellular or hyaline substance. The corpuscles enlarge, with an endogenous development of cell-structures, and bursting, discharge their contents into cavities in the tissue itself, or upon the free surface, mingling with the organic matters contained within the joint, and probably forming pus. (Fig. 424.) This endo- genous productiveness is greater, the nearer to the seat or focus of disease. There, instead of two or three nucleated cells, the corpuscles may contain an almost indefinite number of younger cells, resembling Fig. 424. t Fig. 425.t pus-globules. The inter-cellular or hyaline substance disintegrates, or, in more chronic ulceration, it splits into bands or fibres of varying size, in the midst of which, sometimes, are found gelatinous masses —the changed contents of the cartilage-corpuscles, as Dr. Redfern supposes. (Fig. 425.) These changes proceed more or less rapidly in proportion to the

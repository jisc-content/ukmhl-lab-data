GENERAL PATHOLOGY AND SURGERY. 156 istic of, cancer ? In considering tlie diagnosis of cancer, I shall have occasion to recur to this question. The cell assumes various shapes; either round, more usually caudate or spindle-shaped; and it presents other forms by outgrowths in one or more directions. (Fig. 64.) Fig. 55.t Fig. 54.* These cells are deposited in a filamentous stroma or mesh-work, which has a variable locular arrangement and closeness of texture. (Fig. 55.) This inter-cellular stroma is probably, in most cases, nothing more than the fibrous tissue of the Fig. 56.t textures, amid which the cancer- cells are infiltrated. (Fig. 66.) But another inter-cellular sub- stance—gelatinous, translucent, and amber-coloured—may be pre- sent in more or less abundance, and this is probably peculiar to cancer,—the colloid species. The leading species of cancer are further allied by possessing a similar chemical basis; namely, >i^^^^n| imv chiefly albumen, associated with ^^^^^^^^^:^l^^^^/f^'^///m'^/^ fibrin, gelatine, osmazome, fat, certain salts,—such as the phos- phates and carbonates of lime, with the carbonates of soda and magnesia, the oxide of iron, and But the results of chemical analysis hitherto made are not very reliable. Species.—^As the proportion of cells, or of inter-cellular matter, pre- vails, so do we recognize Encephaloid, or cancer, far excellence, abound- ing with cells; and therefore soft, opaque, and of a dead white or fawn colour. Hence the terms cerebriform or medullary, applied to this * Cancer-cells in the most advanced stage of development.

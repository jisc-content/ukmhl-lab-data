INFLAMMATION. 61 nature. In inflammatory fever of an asfhenic type, and occiirring in debilitated subjects, the pulse may bo one of low tension and consider- ably dicrotic; this is especially the case if there be any tendency to pytemia, when the pulse is almost invariably of low tension and very dicrotic. So, in low forms of asthenic erysipelas, the pulse is often hyperdicrotic, and these cases especially require free stimulation. With pulses of high tension in inflammatory fever, depletion and anti- phlogistic treatment may almost invariably be employed; it is the ' hard' pulse which the old practitioners regarded as the infallible indication for bleeding.

Fear also may be entertained of pysemic infection ; absorption probably takes place more readily in this condition than in high tension. Further indications may be afforded by the amount of pressure required to develop the tracing, and the presence or absence of well-marked percussion showing the strength of the heart and its mode of contraction; a sloping upstroke and a rounded top being the infallible indications of a failing heart. " There is no rule as to the nature of the pulse in inflammatory fever, erysipelas, or pytemia; either high or low tension may occur in either of these conditions. Roughly speaking, however, it may be said that

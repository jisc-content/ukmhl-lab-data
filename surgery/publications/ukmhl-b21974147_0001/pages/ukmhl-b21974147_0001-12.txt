Vlll PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION. tions SO large and various, the Curators of these Museums have enhanced the value of the work by directing my attention to the more noteworthy cases; and here, perhaps, I would thank espe- cially Mr. Charles Stewart, of St. Thomas's Hospital, for thus having criven his aid. My own illustrations, amounting to about one hundred and sixteen, relate partly to microscopic specimens, but principally to clinical cases, and the operations of Surgeiy,â€”in their various stages, and their results. They are mostly indicated by foot- notes, but many other engravings which have no reference whatever have been designed by myself. To the Wood Engi'aver and the Draughtsman, Messrs. George Evans and Son, great credit is due for the finished skill each has displayed in the exercise of his art; limited only by my own particular request to make the engravings faithfully efiective, rather than elaborate. Lastly, the Index has been altered and enlarged, chiefly with reference to the general transfoi'mation which the work has undergone. And, for the convenience of use, this edition is pub- lished in Two Volumes, both in this country and in America. Frederick Jajmes Gant. CONNAUGHT SqUABE, LoNDON, W. Odoher, 1878.

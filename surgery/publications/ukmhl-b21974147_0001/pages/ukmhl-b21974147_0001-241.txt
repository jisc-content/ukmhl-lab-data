ULCERATION AND ULCERS, GANGRENE AND MORTIFICATION. 217 as if the " flow " of a tidal stream washed up more material than the returning " ebb " can well recover—the line of coast shows the remain- ing debris. Even so, the surface of an ulcer may present a rim of slough, and from time to time, another and another, as the margin of the sore recedes and extends. Signs. — Gangrene, or the incipient stage of mortification, exhibits certain characteristic appearances. The skin is livid or has a black hue, shading off to a reddish brown around the dying part. Its con- sistence is changed; becoming soft, with considerable swelling and pitting on pressure, while. the cuticle is raised into vesicles containing a yellowish serum, or phlyctense—large bladders, full of bloody serum. The part is, in fact, altogether sodden and succulent, from the infil- tration of the constituent cellular texture vnth serum. This condition is the humid gangrene of French authors, the hot of German writers, and the acute of our own school. (Fig. 76.) Or the part may be Fig. 76.* hard, shrunken, and dry. An opposite condition, known as dry, cold, or chronic gangrene. (Fig. 77.) In either state, the sensibility of the part is diminished, and its temperature reduced. The odour of gan- FiG. 77.t grene is peculiar and pungent; it becomes foetid with the evolution of gas by decomposition, which, inflating the cellular texture, much increases the swelling; and owing to the admixture of gas and serum, it then has the additional character of crackling under gentle pressure] or of fluctuation like a collection of pus, if the deeper textures be thus * Traumatic humid gangrene.

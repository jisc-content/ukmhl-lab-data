GENERAL PATHOLOGY AND SURGERY. 190 wliicli the muscular fibres themselves undergo in fatty degeneration. By comparing the texfcural elements of muscle in a healthy state, these alterations of structure will be more clearly appreciated. The annexed figures represent the appearances of healthy muscular fibres taken from the hearts of a bullock and sheep, which I examined. Half a dozen fibres are presented in Fig. 68. The transverse striae are well shown, and also the fibrillas projecting from the end of each fibre. Similar appearances are seen in the fibres from the sheep's heart. (Fig. G4.) Pig. 63. Fig. 64. iilpll In fatty degeneration of the muscular fibres, a observed m the human subject, the earliest stage exhibits characteristic alterations. The fibriUce evince a disposition to disintegrate, as shown by their readily splitting longitudinally and tranversely. (Fig. 65, a and b. Wedl.) The transverse strise become less distinct, and oil-particles visible—within the sarco- lemma of the fibres, and externally— besetting the fibres, a condition repre- sented by the fibre to the right of h (Fig. 65) ; but this not an essential condition The former may be termed particles, to distinguish them latter, between the fibres, or _— ... particles. The intra oil-particles appear, firstly (Pigs. 66 and 67) as minate erannles, arranged transversely, as it were, across the dn-ection of the Ihres; thus coLsponding ^^^I^Z^TTIL^^^^ h4hf t« W^^^^^^ highly reiLtive, and by |L1lbl|tyiLthe.;Snhs^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 68, cr simnltaneonsy .n other a'ig^^^^^^ entirely i'ffPP^-''''^^^;^^^^^^ confusedly aggregated to- t^,'^^^SE^^^ '^ol..Jr aspect, in this respect somewhat intra oil- from the inter oil-

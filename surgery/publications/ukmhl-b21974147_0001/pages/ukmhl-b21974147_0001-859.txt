835 DEFORMITIES OF LEG. Fig. 447. Fig. 448. consist in a foi-m of apparatus to correct eycrsion of the knee. The simplest is an inner lateral splint (Pig. 41.8), as a base opposed to the convexity of the curve. In cither kind of deformity. Genu Valgum or Varum, the con- dyles and articular surfaces of the femur and tibia at length undergo changes of form, which are incurable. Hence the importance of early treatment. (3.) Oontraction of Knee-joint.—Un- connected with disease of the joint, resulting in anchylosis with malposition, simple contraction of the knee is liable to take place. The deformity may be either flexion of the leg on the thigh, at an angle of various degrees, or, com- bined with this state, some distortion laterally inwards, with rotation of the tibia outwards. Displacement backwards of the head of the tibia, the end of the femur and patella projecting forwards apparently, is associated with rather an extended position of the leg, and laxity of the joint. The cause of these deformities— apart from joint-disease—seems to be some affection of the ham-string muscles, which induces their contraction, and shortening ultimately. This may be a purely hysterical manifestation, and accompanied with other symptoms of the same constitutional disease. Fig. 449. Treatment must have reference to the apparent cause of contraction. The more fugitive state of hysterical contraction can be overcomo under the relaxing influence of choloroform; the limb is then at once brought down to a straight position, and retained by two lateral splints.

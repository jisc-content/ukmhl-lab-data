90 GENERAL PATHOLOGY AND SURGERY. grcRsiye emaciation and trembling weakness bespeak tbe failure of nutrition; and the general course of the symptoms at length proclaims the victory of exhaustion. Hitherto this fever has been uninterruptedly continuous with that of inflammation; but if it be prolonged, it acquires an intermittent character,â€”exhaustion prevailing, yet with recurring efforts of excite- ment, particularly of the circulation, followed by increased secretions from the skin, kidneys, and bowels. Thus, towards evening, after a day of dread exhaustion and when the skin is pallid, a chill is felt; soon the pulse rises in force slightly, and in frequency to perhaps 100 or ] 30 beats per minute.

The palms of the hands and soles of the feet feel hot and dry. During the night or towards morning, this fitful fever abates with profuse perspiration, urgent liquid diarrhoea, and probably diuresis. Daylight is welcomed, but only with feelings of greater prostration. The temperature in rigor, observes Le Gros Clark, rises always shortly before the commencement of an attack, and remains high for a varying period, commonly about half an hour after the shivering terminates; then it subsides gradually down to the degree from which it rose, or even lower. This diurnal rise and fall of temperature is well indicated in the annexed chart (Fig. 24), relating to a case of hectic

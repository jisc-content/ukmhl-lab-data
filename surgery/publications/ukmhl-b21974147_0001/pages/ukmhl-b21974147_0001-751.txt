727 UNREDUCED DISLOCATION AND FALSE-JOINT. placed bone be lodged upon rmtscle, it gradually burrows for itself a convenient nest, the two surfaces become mutually adapted to each other, and a capsular ligament being formed of condensed cellular tissue, an imperfect joint is established. But should the bone have found a resting-place on hone, this, by absorption, loses its periosteum, and that its articular cartilage; a receptacle is excavated suitable to Fig. 335.* Fig. 336.t Fig. 337. t the impression of the displaced articular surface (Fig. 335) ; a bony- rim or lip is thrown up by the periosteum around the margin of this newly formed cavity; the surrounding cellular texture, moreover, becomes condensed into a capsular ligament, which further provides against any displacement; and thus a far more perfect joint is constructed. (Fig. 336.) A porcellanous deposit takes the place of cartilage, on the head or surface of the dislocated bone; or in- stead of this eburnation (Fig. 337), an imperfect fibro-serous surface or synovial capsule may be formed. The natural articular cavity—whence the bone was dislodged—loses its cartilaginous investment, and closes in. (See Fig. 335.) It is, at length, partially obliterated by a dense fibrous deposit. So also is the trade in the textures, thi'ough which the bone had passed. Associated with this articular transformation are certain accessory, but somewhat accidental changes, in relation to the ligaments, muscles, and tendons. * King's Coll.

RHEUMATISM AND GOUT. 247 hibited. On the other hand, free perspiration should be promoted, to eliminate the acids of the sweat, the retention of which would precipitate uric acid in the urine, and thus lead to the formation of calculus. Warm clothing, warm bathing, friction with horse-hair gloves and belt—an excellent stimulant—and diaphoretics, are therefore most efficacious adjuncts in the treatment of the gouty diathesis. Lithate of ammonia being soluble in urine at the temperature of the body, its solution is secured, provided only that fluid be not over- charged. Dilution of the urine will best prevent supersaturation and deposit. The free use of aqueous drinks or soda water, is calculated to fulfil this indication, and thus probably prevent the formation of a lithate of ammonia calculus. Diuretics, which increase the secretion, will also aid the dilution of the urine; and in both ways tend to eliminate lithic acid or lithates from the system. The wine of colchicum, in doses of ten minims and upwards three times a day, prescribed with the carbonate of potass to keep the lithic acid in combination—the resulting lithates being further held in solution by the administration of diluents—will to- gether carry off both, and soothe the irritability of the bladder which accompanies their discharge. Saline aperients seem to aid this desir- able result. Any prolonged subjection to such a cause of elimination, requires also the simultaneous action of small doses of blue pill, ap- parently to maintain the secretion of bile, which otherwise being retained as compared with the secretion of urine, would disturb the balance of their constituents in the blood.

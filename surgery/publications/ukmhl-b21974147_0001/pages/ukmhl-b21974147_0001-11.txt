PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION. Vil of the Eye " has been revised and considerably enlarged by Mr. Power, senior Ophthalmic Surgeon to St. Bartholomew's Hos- pital ; the chapter on the " Ear " is entirely due to Mr. Purves, Aural Surgeon to Guy's Hospital; and that on "Dental Sur- gery " to Mr. Charles S. Tomes. " Diseases of the Throat and Larynx " are represented by the large experience of Dr. Morell Mackenzie; and, in like manner, Mr. William Adams has dealt with "Deformities," as including Orthopoedic Surgery, and Lateral Curvature of the Spine.

My acknow- ledgments of all these original illustrations from nature are severally specified by foot-notes throughout the work; and for the information of those readers who may be desirous of acquiring yet further knowledge of this series, some descriptive account of the specimen of injury or disease, and clinical history of the case, are not unfrequently appended from the Museum catalogues m each Hospital, thus so as not to intercept the continuity of the text. In my arduous selection of appropriate specimens from collcc-

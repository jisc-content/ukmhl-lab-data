158 GENERAL PATHOLOGY AND SURGERY. Stroma continuous with parts around, draws texture after texture withm the claws, as it were, of the infiltrating mass. (Fig. 58 ) In- filtration penetrates onwards, while contraction pulls backward • so Fig. 57.* that there is a double action at work—like the pulling on of a glove. Colloid cancer, although ill-provided with blood-vessels for rapid growth, is scarcely restrained by a contracting fibrous stroma, and—in this particular resembling encephaloid—it spreads to an indefinite size, but not as a distinct tumour. The circumscribed, or non-circumscribed, condition of cancer much affects its mobility as a distinct tumour. Encephaloid is often dis- tinctly movable in the organ or textures in,,- which it is imbedded; while scirrhus and colloid can be moved about, only as a diffused mass in connection with those textures to which the cancer has contracted adhesion by infiltration. Such are the chief peculiarities respectiiog, the shape, size, and mobility of the three typical species of cancer—in addition to their individual properties of consistence (and colour); and by the concur- rence of which characters they can be recognised during life. Diagnosis of Cancer.—No sufficiently exact structural differences have as yet been detected, by which to distinguish these species of cancer-growth ; we are, therefore, compelled at present to rely solely on their physical characters to determine the question of their {differ- ential) diagnosis, so far as these characters can be recognized through superimposed integuments.

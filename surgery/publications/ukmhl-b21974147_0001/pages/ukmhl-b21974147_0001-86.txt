62 GENERAL PATHOLOGY AND SURGERY. high tension is most likely to be met with in inflammatory fever and low tension m pyaamia. The tracings in Fig. 14 give types of •degrees of high tension occurring in inflammatory fever in different individuals, and from various causes; while those in Fig. 15 give Fig. 15.—Low Tension Pulses in Pya5mia. (a.) Pyjemia. Pr. 2 oz. (h.) Puerperal pyaemia. Pr. 3 oz. (c.) Pyaemia after amputation of thigh. Death two days after- wards. T. 103-5. Pr. 2 oz. types of low tension occurring in pyaemia. The last tracing in Fig. 14 gives the form of pulse immediately preceding death, when the tension has been high throughoub, namely, a short and rather sloping upstroke, with a slight rounding of the apex, and a want of sharpness or rounding off of the angles about the tracing ; while the last tracing in Fig. 15 exhibits the form of pulse preceding death, the tension having been low throughout the illness. In this case the pulse is hyperdicrotic, Avhile the upstroke is also short and a little sloping." The Urine, in Health and Disease.—The urine in disease undergoes alterations which can be estimated only by observing the characters and composition of the urine in health, as the representative and ex- ponent of blood-conditions in health. The student, therefore, Mnll do well to start with this physiological knowledge before proceeding to the description of febrile urine. HEALTHY URINE. Physical Characters.—A fluid, clear, of a bright amber colour, peculiar aromatic odour, and specific gravity or weight, varying from 1-015 to 1-030, the average being 1-020, when cold. The quantity secreted varies from 30 to 80 fluid ounces in twenty-four hours, the

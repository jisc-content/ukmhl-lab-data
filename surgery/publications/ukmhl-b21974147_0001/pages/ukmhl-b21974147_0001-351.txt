327 GLANDEBS. Assuming tliat glanders can be readily detected and distinguisTied from all other diseases, the prevention of its first propagation will consist in forthwith destroying the diseased animal, from which, as the centre of contagion, it might spread. But this precaution is not alone sufficient protection to man or beast. The disease is communicable by fomites, as well as by direct inoculation from one animal to another. In this way, some of the discharge from the nose of a glandered horse having remained about the manger, rack, or partition of a stable, may be thawed by the breath of a new horse, or introduced into the system in the act of nibbling or licking, whereby sou.nd horses have speedily become glandered when put into a stable whence a glandered one had been taken weeks or months previously ; thus reviving the disease, and with imminent peril to grooms and others in attendance. "Let, then," says Youatt, "the halters, head-gear, and bridles be burned; the clothes washed and baked; the pails newly painted; the racks and ranges thoroughly scraped, then washed well with soap and water, and after- wards with chloride of lime and water, in the proportion of a pint of the strong solution to a pail of water; let the walls be well scraped and washed with the chloride of Hme and water, then well lime-washed; the floor be first thoroughly scoured, then sluiced with the chloride: and, with all these precautionary measures, every possibility of danger will be removed."

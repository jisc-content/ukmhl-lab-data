The accompanying figure represents a diffused aneurism becoming circumscribed. (Fig. 109.) Other forms of Aneurism are recognized by Surgical Authors. Fusiform or Tubidar Aneurism is a dilatation of all the coats of an artery, extending throughout the entire circumference of the vessel, * Double-sacced aneurism. The first sac had burst, and the tumour became diffused; but. a second sac of surrounding textures again formed a circumscribed aneurism. (From Sir Charles Bell.) t Dissecting aneurism of aorta,—between the external and middle coats, and extending from the left subclavian artery down to the bifurcation of the abdominal aorta. The tube of the aorta was quite pervious, although compressed by a large firm clot, at the bifurcation ; but tlio left common iliac was obliterated to a fibrous cord. (Path.

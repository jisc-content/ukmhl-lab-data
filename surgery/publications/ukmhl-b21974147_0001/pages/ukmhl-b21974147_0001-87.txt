I Water 524 Ounces measure. In estimating the quantity of any urinary constituent excreted in twenty-four hours, the weight of the body and activity of the functions must both be compared therewith. Thus the excretion of only 150 grains of urea, in a person whose weight is 80 lbs., would be a healthy proportion ; but if the weight be 170 lbs., that quantity would be very disproportionate, and indicate a diseased condition of serious or fatal consequence. The physiological origin of the urinary constituents is represented in the following tabular view, taken from Dr. Golding Bird's well- known work, edited by Dr. Birkett:— 1. Organic I'roduGts. 1st. Ingredients characteristic of the secretion fUrea, uric acid, creatine, creati- produced by the destructive assimilation of tissues, | nine, colouring and odorous and separated from the blood by the kidneys. I principles. 2nd. Ingredients developed principally fromf^^ addition to the above, hip- the food during the process of assimilation. P^"° .^f^""^^ ' ° ^ [ dental constituents. 2. Inorganic Products. 3rd. Saline combinations separated from the blood, and derived from the food. Sulphates, phosphates, chloride of sodium, and all soluble salts taken with the food, and often undergoing decomposi- tion in tlie system. 4th. Saline combinations chiefly generatedfSulphates, during the process of destructive assimilation. (Phosphates. 3. Ingredients derived from the Urinary Passages. 5th. Mucus of the bladder. Gth.

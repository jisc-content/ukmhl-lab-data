SCROFULOUS DISEASE OF THE HIP, OR MORBUS COXARIUS. 823 Fig. 439. Fig. 440. and I bad recourse to excision of the joint. The same splint was reapplied in the after-treatment; but discharge from the wound having a tendency to soak in Fig. 438. between the buttock portion of the splint, I was compelled—for the sake of cleanliness — to return to the external, interrupted thigh-splint. In the treatment, by means of Mr. Thomas's splint, weight-extension from the foot can be as readily applied. Extending appara- tus of various kinds are more or less in use for the treatment of hip - joint disease. I have not yet had any experience of the ad- vantages they are said to offer. The accompanying form of such apparatus is a combination of the leathern hip-splint advo- cated by Sir B. Brodie, with Dr. Davis's metallic lever (Fig. 438) ; but the simple manner in which it is made to control any rotative or ab- ducting movement of the hmb is peculiar. Dr. Sayre, of New York, has called our attention to two splints, a short and a long one, which he com- monly employs. These splints are here represented. (Figs. 439, 440.) They are designed to allow the patient to move about, and thus to have the benefit of exercise in the open air, for the maintenance or restoration of the general health. Such splints, therefore, are ehgible only in an early and slight stage of hip-joint disease, or during conva- lescence from the more advanced stage. The construction of these rather complicated forms of apparatus will be more readily understood by personal examination than from any description, and full particulars

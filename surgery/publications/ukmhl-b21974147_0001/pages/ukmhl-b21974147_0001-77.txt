INFLAMMATION. 63 and required] to develop the pulse, gested by which, to regulate and employed is at once accu- rate and simple. Fig. 7 is a drawing of this instru- ment, from which a general idea of it can be obtained, while Fig. 8 is a sectional diagram to illustrate the ar- rangement of the levers and the method of measuring pressure. The instrument consists of a brass frame- work attached to ivory bars, and is strapped upon the arm, which reposes on a double inclined pad or splint. The framework supports the spring which presses upon the pulse and the system of levers, by which the movements im- parted to the spring by the pulse are magnified and conveyed to the writing lever, which inscribes them upon a slide, moved past its extremity by clockwork. To the framework also is attached a small brass box containing the clockwork; along a groove in the top of this box the slide, on which is stretched smoke paper, travels. " The mainspring of the instrument A (Fig. 8) is at- tached to the framework by a hinge-joint H, and is free at the other end, which is Vai'ious methods have been measure pressure. That I sug- have applied to the pulse. To the centre of this spring is attached a small block c, which is received between the bifurcated extremity of the short intermediate lever B, and which is attached to the block by a pin which forms its centre of movement. The free extremity oÂ£ this lever is

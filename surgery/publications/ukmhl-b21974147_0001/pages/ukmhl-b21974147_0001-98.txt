GENERAL PATHOLOGY AND SURGERY. 74 The qualities of lympli are certainly most obvious when it is effused from simple membi-ances, as the serous—for instance, pleuritic effusions; while the more complex structure of skin and mucous mem- branes retard its separation, and modify its properties by the admixture of their own secretions. Hence the varied products of skin diseases, and those discharged from the gastro-intestinal canal, the urinary and pulmonary passages. It will be desirable first to describe, more particularly, the ele- mentary products of Effusion, including Suppuration ; and then, their apparent source and mode of production, or the pathology of Effusion. Products of Ivflammation—Effusion.—(1.) Coagulable lympt is more or less tenacious and at first transparent, but it acquires a slightly opaque yellow colour. It is produced in the form of minute villi. This appearance is best seen on free surfaces which are least subject to motion or pressure; as between convolutions of the intestines in peritonitis, between the lobes of the lungs in pleurisy, and about Fig. 16.* the base of the heart in pericarditis. (Fig. 16.) But wherever serous surfaces are in contact and play upon each other, the ductile lymph is drawn into threads or plastered into films; as on free portions of the pericardium and pleura, and on the parietal aspect of the intestines. Coagulation having taken place, coagulated lymph is somewhat solid, though still retaining its tenacity and opaquish yellow colour. Its organization, in this its simplest condition of structure, is that o: fine filaments, interwoven in various directions; as in the buffy cont of the blood. These filaments are formed apparently by the liueav union of molecules and they vary fi'om rivTro to toutto of an inch in diameter. * Pericarditis showing villiform lymph. (Bennett.)

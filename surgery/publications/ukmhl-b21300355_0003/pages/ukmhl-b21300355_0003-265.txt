253 FRACTURES. The period at which firm union takes place varies ; the process is more rapid in young people than in those advanced in life, and will depend more on the extent of the injury, and its vicinity to the centre of the circulation, than on the size of the broken bone. The requisite length of confinement is regulated by these circumstances, and by the use to which the ])art is to be afterwards put; the lower limbs require longer time than the upper. In the treatment of fracture, as in solution of con- tinuity in the soft parts, great advantage is gained by placing the disjoined parts as nearly in their original position as possible, retaining them so, and allowing of no motion. These indications ought to be accom- plished very soon after the accident; many evils are thus prevented—the further laceration of the soft parts, the inflammatory effusion into all the tissues, and the consequent startings and spasms of the muscles. This cannot be too much insisted on. There is much folly and absurdity in allowing a broken limb to lie unrestrained—leaving the ends of the bones displaced, the one riding over the other— making attempts to keep down the inflammation, applying leeches and large poultices—all ineffectual so long as the palpable cause of incited action remains unheeded. The circumstances which kindle and keep up inflammation should always be understood when so easily discovered as in fracture, and when under- stood should never be lost sight of. If the parts be replaced there will seldom be inflammation ; if they remain displaced, the inflammation is so great that it is impossible to subdue it by any means short of re-

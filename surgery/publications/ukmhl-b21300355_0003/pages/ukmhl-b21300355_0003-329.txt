317 DISI-OCATIONS. stance resembling it very closely ; the old is gradu- ally filled up and obliterated, the prominences being absorbed, and the cavity occupied by new deposit. These changes do not take place so rapidly as is generally supposed ; the cartilage and synovial sur- face are not much altered for months after the occur- rence of luxation ; and if replacement be effected, the functions of the parts are soon performed as before the injury. In some articulations, on account of the formation of the opposed surfaces, attempts at reduction prove ineffectual after the lapse of two or three weeks ; in others, of more simple construction, it may be accom- plished after some months. The simple mode of reduction is to put the patient off his guard, so that the muscles may be in a state of relaxation, and then to move the limb artfully in the proper direction, without much force. Occasionally, the bone is pulled into its place by the action of the muscles, during the patient's efforts to place the limb in a comfortable position. Considerable force, however, is sometimes required in even recent luxations of large joints, and means must also be taken to weaken the muscular power. The patient, if young and robust, may be bled to syncope, or placed in the warm bath till a sense of fainting supervenes ; or an enema of tobacco infusion may be administered, and smoking of tobacco may have the same effect when the patient has not been addicted to the noxious habit; or antimonial solution may be given in nauseating doses. Several or all of these methods may be necessary in some cases, par-

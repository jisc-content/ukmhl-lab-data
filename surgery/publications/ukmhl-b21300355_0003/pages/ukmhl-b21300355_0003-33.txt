OF HERNIA. 21 permanent cure by contraction of the opening and developement of the surrounding parts. In young per- sons the canal is short, and ahuost direct, and from its^becoraing oblique and elongated during growth, prevention of protrusion may be e'fFected. Descent must never be allowed during such attempts at cure. But in adults such a fortunate result can scarcely be expected ; the truss must be constantly worn during the day, in bed it may be disused, and the patient must rest satisfied with thereby escaping those dan- gers to which protrusion of the hernia would render him always liable. Great care should be taken to ascertain in the morning, before the truss is applied, that no protrusion exists. If the opening be not much dilated, it ma)'- contract even in adults when protrusion is sedulously prevented. The patient will also require to avoid the causes of hernia. If he is subject to cough, or labours under urinary disease, by which the abdominal muscles are called frequently and fully into action, there is no chance of a cure ; the continued use of a truss will alone afford safety. Hernia is rendered irreducible, 1. By the formation of adhesions between the sac and the included parts. 2. By induration of the protruded omentum, and by accumulation of fat in it, or in the appendiculae of pro- truded large intestine. 3. By contraction of the abdo- minal cavity from long-continued displacement of a large portion of its contents. 4. By the nature and connexions of the protruded part, as in hernia of the sigmoid flexure, or of the caput coecum coli. 5. By firm compression of the abdomen. 6. By the tight-

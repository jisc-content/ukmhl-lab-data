BRUISE. 358 thus laid for abscess, either chronic or acute. Fre- quently the inflammatory action following on bruise is not so violent and rapid as that above described, but is limited in its consequences chiefly to the efi"u- sion of coagulable lymph. This may not be altoge- ther absorbed along with the other effusion, it may become organised, and be the nucleus or germ of a new growth, of a tumour contrary to natureâ€” deposit increases in and around the nucleus, and this formation, though at first of a simple nature, may become rapid in its growth, and may assume a trou- blesome or even a malignant action; and sometimes all this may occur at an early period, before the atten- tion either of the patient or of the practitioner has been drawn to the action or to its effects. Many tumours can be traced to the effects of a bruise. In the treatment of bruise, the parts should be placed in a state of absolute rest, and methodically fomented. Local bleeding is seldom required, and is of little use ; at first it is hurtful. When, from the extent or number of the bruises, fever follows, general antiphlogistic measures must be resorted to. Cold and astringent applications, and other repercussives, as also stimulants, are pernicious in the first stage, and are not very useful at any time.

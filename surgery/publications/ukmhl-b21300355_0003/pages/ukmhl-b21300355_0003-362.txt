SPRAIN. 350 tive examination is required to guard against mis- takes ; the existence or non-existence either of dis- placement or of fracture must be at once ascertained by determined and perfect manipulation ; the parts must be pressed and moved, to such an extent as is necessary, notwithstanding the pain thereby occa- sioned, and notwithstanding the resistance afforded by the patient. It has been already stated that lux- ation of the wrist is not uncommon ; that separation of the one bone of the forearm from the other, and fracture of the radius, at the distal extremity, are accidents by no means rare. Great disfiguration follows simple sprain, much swelling taking place on the fore part of the limb from effusion under the fascia, and there is also much serous and bloody in- filtration of the cellular tissue on the back of the hand and forearm. In the ankle, the ends of the bones must be carefully examined, and also the fibula in its whole extent, that the existence or non-existence of fracture may be ascertained, and that the surgeon may be guided to a correct mode of treatment. If the joint is not put at rest immediately, the extra- vasation is increased, and, in consequence, the pain and inflammatory swelling also ; and parts of the joint at first not involved in the injury may thus be made to suffer. Many diseases of synovial membrane and articulating cartilages are attributable, and can be traced, to badly managed sprains ; and in some constitutions, but slight injury, combined with a little bad treatment, suffices to destroy a joint. When the case is well managed, the pain is never great, and

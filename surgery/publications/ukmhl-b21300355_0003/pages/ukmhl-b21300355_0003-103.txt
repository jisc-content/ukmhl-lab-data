GONOllllHCEA. 91 supporting the organ, or have the part exposed to friction, swelling will inevitably take place. From this cause Phymosis and Paraphymosis are apt to occur â€”affections that will be afterwards described. From the same cause the inguinal glands often enlarge, but such swelling is generally small and seldom suppu- rates. Induration and enlargement sometimes occur along the urethra from effusion of lymph, or from obstruc- tion and distension of the lacunae. Suppuration may take place at these points, and the matter escape either into the urethra or externally. Swelling of the lymphatics of the penis is by no means uncommon in severe or neglected cases of gonorrhoea; a hard chord, tender, and extremely painful when pressed, is felt running along the dorsum penis, and terminates in the inguinal cluster of glands, which are in general also affected. Inflammation and abscess under the strong tendinous sheath that envelopes the penis oc- casionally follows the affection of the lymphatics. The whole penis swells greatly, with fever and much pain ; the matter is confined, burrows under the un- yielding sheath, and appears either at the junction of the glans and prepuce, or over the symphysis pubis. Occasionally the inflammation is not confined to the extremity of the urethra, but pervades its whole extent, in consequence of maltreatment, neglect, or idiosyncrasy. On this account, abscess in the peri- neum, or over that part of the urethra which is co- vered by the scrotum, is no uncommon consequence of a badly managed clap; the inflammatory action

CALCULUS VESICAE. 205 ploying it partly as a lever, partly as an extractor, removal is completed. If the stone break, which should not often happen if the forceps be used properly, the fragments must be carefully brought away, the larger by the forceps, the others by the scoop. The sand and detritus which may remain are washed away by injecting tepid water into the bladder, afterwards promoting copious secretion of urine by diluents. After almost every operation for stone, particularly when the concretions are numerous, or when they have broken into fragments, a searcher is useful to ascertain whether or not all have been removed. It is a slightly curved sound, with a bulbous point. Having been introduced by the wound, it is passed into every part of the bladder with great care, with the view of detecting small calculi, or fragments, which may have escaped the search of the finger, forceps, and scoop. Besides this precaution, the extracted fragments should be carefully examined, and the stones built up, that the surgeon may better judge if they be all there. The surface of the stone affords considerable information; if it be uniformly rough, the likelihood is that it is solitary ; if one or more points are smooth, it is probable that these have been occasioned by the attrition of other calculi. If suspicion still exist of part remaining, examination may be made through the wound, during the suppu- rative stage, six or eight days after the operation, before it has closed much. It has been proposed to break the stone when very

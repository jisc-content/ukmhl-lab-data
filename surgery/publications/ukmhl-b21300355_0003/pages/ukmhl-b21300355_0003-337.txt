LUXATION OV THE SHOULDER-.TOrNT. 325 accomplished, the bloody swelling first occurs to ob- scure the symptoms; this may in part subside, but then the inflammatory supervenes ; both after a time disappear, the muscles waste, and then all the signs are very apparent. After some weeks, the motions of the limb become more extensive, not in conse- quence of the head of the humerus having changed its position, or returned into the glenoid cavity, but from the scapula moving on the ribs more freely, and to a greater extent than usual. At last, but not till after a long period, considerable motion can be effect- ed ; the scapula, where the head of the humerus rests, having furnished an adventitious cavity, to which the latter has adapted itself. But free motion can never be regained, for the movements that are effected are chiefly produced by the action of the muscles of the scapula. Replacement, even in very recent cases, sometimes is accomplished with difficulty in those whose muscles are fully developed. But in general a successful re- sult will follow simple measures, particularly if the patient is taken unawares—^as by rotating the arm with one hand whilst the fingers of the other are placed in the axilla, then suddenly lifting the head of the bone outwards, and at the same time performing abduction—the patient being all along assured that he will not be put to pain, and that there is no inten- tion of attempting reduction. In this manner reduc- tion may often be accomplished by the surgeon and one assistant; the trunk and scapula being fixed by the assistant either grasping the patient in his arms,

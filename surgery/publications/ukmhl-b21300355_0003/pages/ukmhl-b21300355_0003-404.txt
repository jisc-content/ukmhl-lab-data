392 AMl'UTATION OF THE LEG. ration there is no necessity for laying down the knife and using a bistoury. The muscles in the in- terosseous space are then completely divided, and the knife swept round the bones to detach the soft parts still uncut. The saw is applied, either in a horizon- tal or perpendicular direction; I prefer the latter for reasons already assigned. The vessels are scoured, and there are generally but threeâ€”the popliteal, and two sural. Before adjusting the flap, it is well to assist nature in rounding off the end of the tibia, and thereby prevent danger to the integument; with this view the sharp anterior ridge of the bone is cut away and rounded off by means of the pliers. To some the fibular incision may appear unnecessary; but I have long practised it from conviction of its advantage. It is an excellent mark for transfixion, and assists greatly in preventing entanglement of the knife betwixt the two bones ; besides the soft parts there must be divided at one or other step of the operation, and hence the procedure cannot be objected to on the ground of causing unnecessary wound. In operating on the left limb, there is not the same danger in transfixion, and consequently so long a preliminary incision on the inside is not requi- site ; in other respects the steps of the operation are the same as for removal of the right. It has been proposed to excise the head of the fibula after formation of the flap, instead of sawing it across at a corresponding point with the tibia. At one time I put this modification into extensive prac- tice, with the effect of improving the appearance of the stump very considerably; but in several cases,

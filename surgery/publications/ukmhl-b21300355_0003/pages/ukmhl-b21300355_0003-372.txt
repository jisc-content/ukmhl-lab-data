AMPUTATION. 360 which the patient is placed, and often also by his own feelings upon the subject. He may choose to run some risk, and endure much suffering, with even a very slight chance of ultimately preser- ving his limb. In cases of traumatic gangrene of the chronic form, amputation is not only justifiable but imperative; as also, in those cases of severe frac- ture, in which the patient is sinking under pro- fuse discharge, with disunited bones. And the same absolute necessity for operation exists in many dis- eased joints, and in some diseased bones, when the patient's safety would otherwise be endangered, or when, on mature consideration, it is evident that the member, if retained, must for ever be an encum- brance, and worse than useless. Certain tumours of bones, tumours involving joints, tumours and ul- ters of the soft parts of a malignant nature, and without appreciable disease of the lymphatic system, will also demand recourse to the amputating knife. Patients, too, will be met with who, after under- going all the suffering attendant on disease of long duration—as exfoliation and sloughing of tendons, following deep suppuration—will, to get rid of the annoyance of the stiff and deformed member, or part of a member, not only submit to, but urge and insist on, the removal of the offending part. Amputation will also occasionally be required for badly-formed stumps, as those in which the end of the bone pro- trudes through ulcer of the integument, and is ne- crosed—or those in which the bone has been sawn of an inconvenient length.

The affection attract- ed but little of his notice till about six months since, when he observed a considerable swelling in the site of the wound, beating strongly, and the pulsations accompanied with a peculiar thrilling sound and feel —not confined to the tumour, though strongest there, but extending to the groin along the course of the femoral vein, which was evidently much dilated throughout its whole course. At present the tumour is nearly equal to the fist in size, of regular surface and globular form, pulsating very strongly, and im- parting to the hand the peculiar sensation of aneu- rismal varix, remarkably distinct and powerful. The pulsation and thrilling are continued, in a less de- gree, to Poupart's ligament, and down to the calf of the leg.

By making firm pressure on the tu- mour, the thrill is lost, and the regular pulsation alone perceived ; at the same time, the turgescence of the femoral vein disappears, and on compressing the femoral artery in the middle of the thigh, both pul- sation and thrilling are arrested, and the swelling much diminished,—but only temporarily, for the col- lateral circulation is free and complete.

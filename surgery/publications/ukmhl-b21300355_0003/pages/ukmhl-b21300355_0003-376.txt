AMPUTATION. 364 muscles, through the cellular and fatty tissues, and through the integumentsâ€”or vice versa, if the mode from without inwards be preferred. By these parts being cut rapidly and at once, their connexions with each other are not separated, the cut surface is smooth, and the parts are in the most favourable state for becoming agglutinated and consolidated; the bone is more deeply covered, and the stump of a handsomer and more useful shape, than when the parts are cut successively and with detachment. The operator places himself so that he may grasp the part to be removed, diu'ing the sawing of the bone, without change of position. The incisions are made with the left hand free ; but as soon as the saw is in the right, the left should take firm hold of the limb below the wound. During the operation, the limb is supported by an assistant, either sitting or kneeling ' before the patient; but the regulating of the position of the limb, during sawing, is not to be intrusted to him. He may, from anxiety to facilitate the action of the saw, snap the bone and splinter it; or, from dread of this, he may lock the instrument, and so delay completion of the operation. The management of the lower part of the limb should always be by the person using the saw. This instrument should have its teeth well set, and be provided with a workman- like handle. It is worked steadily and not hurriedly, with very slight pressure, and that pressure employ- ed only when pushing forwards. Before its applica- tion, all the soft parts must necessarily be divided completely; and this is done by carrying the knife.

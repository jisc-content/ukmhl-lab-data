239 LIGATURE 01'' FEMOllAI-. across ; or the artery cannot be found, and an addi- tional external wound is necessary. The artery may require ligature at a higher point, either in consequence of wound, or for the cure of femoral aneurism. This disease, however, is very unfrequent. When it does exist, it is usually so situated as not to admit of the favourable application of a ligature below the origin of the profunda ; and it is necessary to tie the common femoral. The course of this artery being superficial, is easily as- certained ; an incision of convenient extent is made in the same line, penetrating the skin and fatty mat- ter ; the cellular tissue is carefully separated, and the sheath exposed ; a limited opening is made, with cor- responding detachment of the vessel, and the ligature applied, close to the lower edge of the ligament of Poupart. But ligature of the external iliac, is in most cases to be preferred. This has proved successful in more than one case of double aneurism, one in the groin, the other in the ham. In ligature of the common and of the superficial femoral, the vein is in more danger than the nerve, and the utmost caution is required lest it be punc- tured. It has been woundedâ€”I witnessed one in- stance of it; the opening was drawn together and closed by ligature, inflammation of the vein super- vened and proved fatal. When secondary bleeding occurs, on the separa- tion of the ligature, either after this operation or

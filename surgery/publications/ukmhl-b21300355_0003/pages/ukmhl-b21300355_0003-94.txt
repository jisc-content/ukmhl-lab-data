Indeed the practice of exci- sion was recently in vogue at Paris. But the opera- tion for fistula has been much simplified. The bowel is generally so much separated from its con- nexions, as to be incapable of again adhering, or of furnishing granulations ; and though capable, heal- ing is effectually prevented by the frequent motion of the parts caused by the action of the sphincter and levator of the anus. One side of tlie cavity is fixed, whilst the other is in motion. It becomes necessary to lay the cavities of the bowel and of the fistula into one. This can generally be effected with great ease; a salutary degree of excitement follows the use of the knife, rest to the parts is procured, the edges are allowed to retract and adhere to the opposite surface, and the wound heals quickly from the bottom. The surgeon, in his operative proce- dure on these parts, must use both hands equally well, otherwise the patient must vary his position, and be often put in a very awkward predicament, more particularly if a female. The patient is placed in a stooping posture, with the legs unbent, and the fundament turned towards the light. The surgeon inserts the finger, well soaped and oiled, into the rec- tum, and with the other hand insinuates a curved probe-pointed bistoury into the sinus, using the in- strument merely as a probe. Having reached the extreme depth of the canal, the direction of the in- strument's point is changed so as to apply its cutting

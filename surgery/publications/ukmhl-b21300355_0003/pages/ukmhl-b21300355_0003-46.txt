34 OF HERNIA. the patient i)laced in the recumbent posture, with the shoulders slightly elevated. The mode of opera- tion must be varied according to the nature of the tumour, its size, and other circumstances. The operation for inguinal hernia is conducted as follows:â€”The patient is placed recumbent on a table, or, in private practice, on the side of a bed, his shoulders supported by pillows, and his feet resting upon a stool. An incision is commenced about an inch above the external abdominal ring, and continued to the bottom of the tumour. This latter part of the procedure, however, is applicable only to small and moderately-sized hernias; in large tumours the wound is not made so low, for in them the bowels may be irreducible, from the quantity protruded, and the con- tracted state of the abdominal cavity: in such cases the incision should be only to such an extent as is sufficient to enable the operator to reach the stricture. The first cut is carried through the skin and fatty matter, not deeper. The layers are then divided suc- cessively, with the hand unsupported ; and this is done only at the middle and projecting part of the swelling. It is unnecessary to prolong the incision of the layers along the whole extent of the wound in the integuments, at this stage of the proceedings. In the direct hernia, which is of rare occurrence, there is but one proper layer, that furnished by the superficial abdominal fascia : not unfrequenth^ there is an imperfect additional envelope, furnished by fibres from the edge of the external ring; but in the common inguinal hernia there are three or four, and these are thickened more or less according to the

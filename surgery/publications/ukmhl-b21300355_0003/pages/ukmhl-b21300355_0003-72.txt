OF LUMBAR ABSCESS. 60 diaphragm into the adherent lung,and communicating with the bronchi. The fore part of the lumbar ver- tebrae was exposed, and in some parts stripped of the theca ; but there were no cavities in the bone, and no disease of the interposed cartilages. Such cases are now and then met with, of abscess in the loins not originating in any vice either of the bones or of any other part of the apparatus of the spinal column. Most frequently, however, the collections have their foundation in ulceration of the bodies of the vertebrae. The patient has had tenderness in the part, weakness of the back and of the lower limbs, and increase of pain on pressing or striking some particular spinous processesâ€”perhaps slight excurvation. Then pain in extending the thigh supervenes, followed by swelling and other signs of abscess. The lumbar vertebrae are those most frequently affected, but the ulceration may also be either in the dorsal region or in the pelvis. Disease of the last lumbar vertebrae at its connexion with the sacrum, or disease of the sacrum itself, is attended with abscess around, which descends into the pelvis, displacing the bowel and appearing by the side of the buttock. Such abscesses mav have been allowed to come to the surface, and to discharge their contents sponta- neously ; or they may have been at a late period opened either at one point or at several. In these circumstances, the discharge is generally profuse, long continued, and attended with exhaustion and hectic, gradually but surely destroying the patient.

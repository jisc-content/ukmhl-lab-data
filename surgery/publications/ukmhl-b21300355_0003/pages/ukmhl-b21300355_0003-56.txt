OF HERNIA. 44 the mouth, and by the anus when the injured part is high in the canal. The separation of the sloughs is to be encouraged. And the extent of sloughing need not dishearten the surgeon, for large portions of bowel, several feet in length, have mortified, and the patients recovered, with artificial anus, either temjDorary or for life. In artificial anus, when the bowel has perished to a considerable extent, the intestine has contracted firm adhesion to the hernial sac at the opening in the abdominal parietes ; through the opening in the bowel exterior to this, the fseculent matter is discharged externally, and by the adhesion is prevented from being effused into the abdominal cavity. The pro- truded bowel in which the sphacelation has occurred may be said to be thereby divided into an upper and an under portion,â€”one, the upper, discharging ; the other, collapsed and empty ; these lie parallel to each other, in close contact, and usually adhering, from the abdominal ring downwards, to each other, and to the hernial sac. The hernial sac seldom sloughs entirely; in almost every case its neck remains sound; to this remaining part the intestine adheres. The deficiency in the integuments and cellular tissue, through which the faeculent matter escapes, gradu- ally contracts, and the aperture in that portion of the hernial sac which is exterior to the intestine also diminishes; but at the same time dilatation takes place in the immediate vicinity of the intestinal ori- fices, so that a funnel-like cavity is formed for the evacuation of faeces, extending from the opening in

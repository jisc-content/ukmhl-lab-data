LIGATURE OF FEMOllAI.. 238 suit, in some cases of very large aiieurisniul tumour, and in one instance after the cyst had been impru- dently punctured. An incision is made from three to four inches in length, and in an oblique direction in regard to the thigh, tracing the inner border of the sartorius muscle, and so placed that its middle may correspond with that part of the artery on which the ligature is to be put. In order to insure the wound being thus situated, there is no need for mea- surements ; these are but a clumsy substitute for anatomical knowledge. The surgeon, well acquaint- ed with the relative situation of the parts, finds it sufficient to ascertain the exact course of the muscle by manipulation, whilst the thigh is slightly bent, and then guides his knife by the eye, unfettered with mathematical diagrams. The muscle is exposed al- most by the first incision ; the dissection is then con- tinued through the cellular tissue on its inner border, until the sheath of the bloodvessels is reached, the branches of the crural nerve on the fore part being carefully placed aside uninjured; the sheath is cau- tiously opened immediately above where the muscle conceals it, and the artery separated from its connex- ions to a very slight extent; the needle is then passed, and the ligature applied. The operation, when thus conducted, is exceedingly simple. But embarrass- ment and delay have often been experienced from fol- lowing an opposite method, cutting down on the out- side of the sartorius ; the muscle must either be dis- sected from its attachments and turned over, or cut

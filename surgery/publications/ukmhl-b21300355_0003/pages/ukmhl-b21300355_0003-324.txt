312 DISUNITED FRACTURE. ends can be moved very freely on each other without crepitation or much pain. This, as akeady stated, may be referrible to various causes—necessary or ac- cidental evacuations, natural or not—diversion of the nutritious fluids to some particular organ, as in preg- nancy—the period of life, a diseased state of the bone or of the marrow, &c. By keeping the parts immo- vable and firmly compressed for some time longer, consolidation may be brought about. But in spite of every care, the ends of the bones in some cases remain unconnected by any save a soft medium. This hap- pens, however, very rarely under proper manage- ment. I have had but one case of it in my own practice, when the patient was from the first under my own inspection and care ; and in that the occur- rence of false joint was attributable solely to the absurd conduct of the patient. He was tripped up on the street by some individuals following their avocation as pickpockets, fell, and broke his forearm. The fracture was immediately reduced and splints applied—one of pasteboard on each side, Avith a wooden one exteriorly till the pasteboard hardened. He soon cut away the ends of the splints—within thirty-six hours after they had been put on—so as to allow motion of the fingers and hand, sufficient for indulgence in card playing. The splints were still farther shortened, and wholly removed much too soon ; shortly afterwards he fell from horseback. No union took place by bone. Unless in the case of pre- vious disease of the bone, disunion is generally attri- butable to some carelessness or recklessness, either of the surgeon or of the patient.

RETENTION OF URINE. 130 of the tumour, per anum, often is a very painful proceeding; it is best accomplished when a catheter or sound is introduced. The disease is often co- existent with calculus in the bladder. The tumour is very seldom malignant, but proves both trouble- some and dangerous from its size. The bladder may become distended in consequence, though re- taining the power of partially relieving itself; or the urine may come away involuntarily after some time; or retention may be complete, and, if not re- lieved, the bladder or urethra may slough. It is to be recollected, that in retention of urine, from whatever cause, and particularly in that ari- sing from prostatic enlargement, the urethra is elon- gated, and the bladder rises into the abdomen like the gravid uterus. The reason of such change of rela- tive situation is sufl&ciently obvious, being chiefly mechanical. Fungous, or other tumours, furnishing blood or vitiated puriform matter, now and then grow from the internal surface of the bladder, unconnected with the prostate gland. Worms, too,—spiroptera homi- nis,—occasionally lodge in the bladder. Either of these circumstances may induce retention of urine. Another cause of obstruction is hernia of the bladder. There is no disease in which the patient is more liable to be ' bungled out of his life,' than in reten- tion of urine. Great credit is to be gained by judi- cious and skilful management of the various stages, and by expert use of the catheter in difficult cases, when others, after being foiled, have proposed opera-

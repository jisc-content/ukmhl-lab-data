OF ASCITES. 49 must be guided by his anatomical knowledge. No positive rules can be given. In Ascites, or accumulation of fluid in the peri- toneal cavity, the surgeon is not unfrequently called upon to relieve the patient, when the abdominal parietes are much distended, and the functions of the viscera of the abdomen and thorax interrupted. He must, however, exercise his own judgment in regard to the case, and convince himself of the propriety of operating. He must examine into the symptoms, and ascertain that the tumour is really caused by accumu- lation of fluid in the bag of the peritoneum. In ascites, the abdomen has swelled slowly and uniformly, and distinct fluctuation is felt when the hand is placed on one side of the swelling, and gentle tapping made at the other. There is considerable difficulty of breath- ing, uneasiness in the abdomen usually increased by pressure, thirst, and scanty secretion of urine. It ought to be remembered, that other affections have been confounded with ascites, and lamentable opera- tive mistakes committed in consequence. Trocars have been thrust into the belly for tympanitis, either of the bowels or of the peritoneum—for solid tumours of the viscera—for enlargement of the ovaria. As already hinted, the operation of tapping the abdomen is to be undertaken only when the distension is very great, when the functions of the thoracic and abdominal viscera are interfered with, and when diuretics, and other means of getting rid of the fluid, have failed to diminish the accumulation.

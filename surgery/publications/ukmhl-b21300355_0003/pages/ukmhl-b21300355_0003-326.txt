"DISLOCATIONS. 314 To the last method I would, from some experience, give the preference. It is the least severe, both im- mediately and consecutively ; it is the most readily accomplished, and the most likely to be followed by a successful result. The exact site of the ends of the bones must in the first place be ascertained ; the position of the bloodvessels and nerves must be look- ed to, that they may be avoided ; a bistoury is then passed through the skin and down into the substance interposed between the ends of the bones. A strong and sharp needle, fixed in a handle, and with its eye near the point, is passed, in the track of the knife, fairly betwixt the bones, and pushed through the soft parts on the opposite side of the limb. A cord is then passed through the eye, and by withdrawal of the needle the seton is properly lodged. The effects rnust be attentively watched, and when sufficient action is supposed to have been excited, perhaps at the end of the first week, the cord is withdrawn, and the limb placed immovable in a proper position. If action is slow in supervening, the chord may be smeared with irritating substances, as the unguen- tum oxydi hydrargyri rubri, meloes vesicat: &c. In this manner I have treated false joint in several situ- ations successfully, but I have also been sometimes foiled in effecting my purpose. Much will depend on the period at which the practice is adopted.

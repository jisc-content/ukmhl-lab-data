163 HYDROCELE. and proniiiieiit; into this a trocar and canula are plunged, piercing the coverings in a perpendicular direction, and then inclining the canula upwards, the stilet being partially withdrawn, so as to avoid wounding the testicle. When fairly passed within the cavity, the trocar is withdrawn entirely, and the fluid escapes through the canula—gentle pressure being employed towards the conclusion. The wound usually heals in a few hours. Various means of radi- cal cure have been proposed—incision, seton, caustic, and the injection of stimulating fluids. Incision and the seton are now abandoned, and do not require no- tice. The application of caustic perhaps may prove efficient in children when tapping has failed, and in youths; an aperture is thus made, through which the fluid escapes, and at the same time considerable excitement is induced, which may prevent reproduc- tion< I have made trial of it in several instances, and generally with success ; but am now inclined to avoid it, having lately experienced much diflSiculty in keeping within moderate bounds the inflammatory action which succeeded its application. Injection is now generally practised; and if carefully performed, it is unattended with risk, and almost invariably suc- cessful. Various fluids may be employed—cold water, wine, wine and water, spirits, a solution of the sul- phate of zinc, &c. I use pure port wine ; and have scarcely ever seen its effects either excessive or defi- cient. I can remember very few cases in which the dis- ease returned after this injection. Having ascertained that the testicle is sound, or but slightly enlarged—

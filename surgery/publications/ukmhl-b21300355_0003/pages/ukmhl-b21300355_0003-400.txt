388 AMPUTATION OF THE TOES. frequent cause of amputation at this part, and this will always influence the method of incision. There is nothing peculiar in the after treatment of the stump. But it ought always to be remembered, that the operation is one of great severity, that a large part of the body has been suddenly removed, that, consequently, there is risk of the mere shock being dangerous, and of an untoward constitutional con- dition supervening—and, therefore, the after attend- ance should be zealous and careful. The phalanges of the toes are removed in the same way as those of the fingers. In the amputation at the proximal joint, it is to be recollected, that the extremity of the metatarsal bone lies more removed from the web of integument betwixt the toes, than the metacarpal bone does from that of the fingers. The incision upwards, therefore, requires to be deeper; but in other respects the operations ai*e pre- cisely the same. In amputating at the proximal articulation of the great toe, there is often a difficulty in obtaining a sufficient covering for the wound, on account of the presence of the sesamoid bones, and the general bul- ging of the bones. The knife is entered on the dor- sum of the metatarsal bone, about half an inch above the joint, and then inclined to each side, marking out lateral flaps of considerable length; these are then reflected,—in making the outer, the instrument being dexterously passed round the sesamoid bone,—and the disarticulation completed. In removing the great toe, along with themetatar-

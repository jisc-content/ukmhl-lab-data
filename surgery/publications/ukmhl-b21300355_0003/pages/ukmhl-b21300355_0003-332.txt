320 LUXATION OF THE CLAVICLE. Sliming its place, they are easily slipped into the space betwixt the jaw and the cheek. There is no neces- sity for bandaging, as retentive apparatus ; the pa- ^ tient is not likely to yawn for some time after. Luxation of the clavicle^ at either end, is produ- ced by force applied to the point of the shoulder. It is seldom that the sternal extremity is separated from its connexions. When this accident does happen, it is easily recognised; the end of the bone is promi- nent and loose, and is distinctly felt riding over the top of the sternum. Replacement is effected by bringing back the shoulder; but the bone is with difficulty retained in the proper position, and is long in becoming fixed; a certain degree of deformity is ever after present. Displacement of the scapular extremity is by no means rare, and occurs to a greater or less extent, according to the laceration of the ligaments. If those only are torn which connect the end of the bone to the acromion, there is mere rising of the end. But if—as is often the case, when the violence has been great, as in a fall either from a height or with great velocity—the conoid and trapezoid ligaments, con- necting the tuberosity of the bone with the coracoid process, have given way, then the end of the bone projects, pushes out the deltoid, and gives rise to con- siderable flattening of the shoulder. The arm falls forwards, and cannot be moved but with pain ; nor is the patient able to raise it by muscular power. If the surgeon grasps the middle of the bone, he finds

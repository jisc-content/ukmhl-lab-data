AFFECTIONS OF THE CHEST. attends it is altogether very different from such as continues for weeks, severe at one time, and slight at another. In regard to the chest, the affections, inflammatory or not, of the internal parts, must be carefully dis- tinguished from those of the external, as of the in- tercostal muscles. These are often affected from in- juries, or from exposure to cold, and give rise to symptoms which may appear to indicate serious dis- ease of the included visceraâ€”difficult breathing, ef- fected with great pain, and very distressing; pain on pressure and on motion of the ribs; frequent, painful, and ineffectual efforts to cough; general anxiety, and more or less disturbance of the constitu- tion. The tendinous coverings of the costal cartil- ages, and of the sternum, may be involved, and some- times considerable and painful swelling takes place in consequence. Mercurial influence is no iinfrequent cause of such perichondriac affection. Before proceeding to active treatment, that is, bleeding to the extent of pounds, the surgeon should make himself very sure that inflammation of import- ant and vital organs does really exist. Every cir- cumstance must be taken into consideration, and well weighed ; it is far easier to take away vital fluid than to replace it. The age, temperament, previous life, state of constitution, must all be attended to. "When inflammation of internal parts has actually com- menced, every endeavour must be made to procure resolution; effusion and suppuration are to be dread- ed, as generally fatal.

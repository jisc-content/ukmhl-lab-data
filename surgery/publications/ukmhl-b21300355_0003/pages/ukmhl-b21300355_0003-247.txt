235 LIGATURE OF INTERNAL ILIAC. ed needle, armed with a firm ligature, is pushed be- neath, without force, and close to the coats of the vessel. The deligation is made firmly, and both ends of the ligature are brought out at the wound ; this is then approximated by a sufficient number of stitches, and a compress and bandage applied. This operation is not often required. I had re- course to it once in bleeding after very high amputa- tion of the thigh, occurring some days after the ope- ration. The haemorrhage was effectually arrested, but the patient did not recover from the effects of the previous loss of blood, and continued to sink. Aneurism of the branches of the internal iliac, whether spontaneous or the result of wound, is rare. When it does exist, its signs are sufficiently distinct. The old operation—opening the tumour by direct incision, and tying the vessel close to the cyst—has been performed successfully in one remarkable case on record. But this is attended with much risk, there being no means of commanding the bleeding du.ring the incisions, nor until the ligature is placed and secured. The preferable proceeding is to tie the internal iliac, near its origin, as has been put in prac- tice successfully in a few cases. The same incisions are made as for reaching the common iliac, and then the sacro-iliac junction is felt for ; with the nail of the forefinger the cellular tissue is cautiously and gently separated, and a needle and ligature placed under the vessel. In a corpulent adult, the needle, with a movable point, will be useful, as also the

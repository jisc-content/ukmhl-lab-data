PHYMOSIS AND rARAPHYMOSlS. 154 if attempts at reduction are injudiciously persevered in. When he is foiled in reduction, or deems the attempting of it imprudent, the stricture must be divided ; and in this simple operation much error is often committed from ignorance of the nature of the disease, and of the relative situation of the parts. It is necessary to divide only the edge of the prepuce, which, from being reflected, alone composes the stric- ture. The anterior and posterior swellings are to be separated as far as possible, and, in the very bottom of the depression between, the stricture is exposed ; a slight incision, a scratch, through this, either with the point of a bistoury, or with a lancet, is sufficient; the tight edge of the prepuce—the only part in fault—is divided, and then, by the jjrocess already detailed, reduction can be readily effected. After reduction, a minute notch in the extreme edge of the prepuce is the only deformity visible, except the swelling. But if, from ignorance of the true seat of the stricture, extensive incisions have been made, pretty much at random, the organ will be consider- ably disfigured—and that unnecessarily. By fomen- tations, rest, and low diet, the effusion will be dissi- pated in a very few days. Reduction is difficult when the contraction has continued for some time, and the tissues have become glued together by ef- fused lymph.

VESICO-VAGINAL FISTULA. 224 and moving the point of the instrument thence down- wards ; but when this method is pursued, the cathe- ter is apt to enter the more patent passage. The instrument is to be carried gently onwards, in a ho- rizontal direction, till the urine flows. In some cases of enlargement and displacement of the neighbouring parts, the urethra is elongated, and its course irre- gular ; in such, a long elastic catheter is required. If objections are made to the use of the catheter, at an early period of retention, nitrous ether may be given internally, fomentations applied to the hypogastrium, and a turpentine enema administered. Puncture of the bladder can seldom, if ever, be necessary in the female ; if it should be required, the opening may be made either above the pubes or through the vagina. From the latter method there is a risk of fistula remaining ; but this, as will afterwards be noticed, can in most cases be ultimately made to close. The operation above the pubes has, in some instances, been necessary during parturition, when instruments could not be passed by the urethra, nor through the coats of the vagina and bladder. False communication betwixt the vagina and blad- der, termed Vesico-vagiual Jistula, is usually the re- sult of mismanagement during parturition. The bladder has been allowed to become over-distended, and in this state to be pressed upon and bruised by the child's head ; or it may have been compressed and bruised by instruments employed in tedious de- livery. The consequence is inflammation, violent, and followed by sloughing. On the separation of the

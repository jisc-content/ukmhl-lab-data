322 LUXATION OF THE SHOULDEll-JOINT. able time, and in some cases a cure may be so effect- ed ; but in general the bone soon regiains its former unnatural position, and continues to do so, however often and however easily it may be replaced. The parts gradually become accustomed to the change in relative position, and little inconvenience is expe- rienced. Luxation of the Shoulder-joint is prevented, by the arrangement and structure of the parts, from taking place in any direction excepting towards the axillaâ€”downwards into the hollow of the arm pit, downwards and forwards under the lower border of the pectoral muscle. On that side the articulation is not supported, as at its other aspects, either by mus- cular substance or by processes of bone. The acci- dent is occasioned sometimes, though rarely, by di- rect violence, as by a blow on the back part of the shoulder ; and of such I have seen a few examples. But in almost every instance, the displacement is caused by force applied to the distal extremity of the humerus ; either immediately, as by falling on the elbow ; or through the forearm, as when a per- son endeavours to break a fall by stretching out the arm, and falls with the whole weight of the body on the palm. The accident may also result from forcible abduction of the extremity, particu- larly when the power is applied near the extremity of the limb. There is laceration, to a greater or less extent, of the caj^sule, and of the muscles immedi- ately investing the fibrous tissue round the articu- lating cavity. Without disruption, complete luxation

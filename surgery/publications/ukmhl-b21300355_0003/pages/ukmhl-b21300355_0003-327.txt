DISLOCATIONS. 315 they are crossed by tendons, and tied together by ligaments in such a manner,â€”that dislodgement can scarcely be effected but by the most violent means. Nothing short of immense force is sufficient, and the displacement is uniformly attended with fracture of portions of the bones, or of their processes. Other bones are loosely joined, permitting free and unre- strained motion in all or in many directions, and but little force, applied in particular directions, suffices to separate and luxate them. In every joint the pro- cesses are liable to be broken, and the attachments of the ligaments to be torn off; ligamentous tissue with- stands a greater degree of sudden violence than the osseous. The synovial membrane, and the fibrous tissue exterior to it, are almost always torn in com- plete luxation ; but the extent of laceration varies in different joints, according to the direction of luxation and the degree of displacement. The rent may be small, closely embracing the neck of the bone ; or there may be an extensive gap on the side opposite to that on which the luxation has taken place. In an articulation surrounded by muscular substance, there is also laceration of this to a greater or less extent. In some individuals, dislocation is very apt to occur, perhaps from peculiar laxity of fibre ; and if in any person luxation of a joint has once been produced, the accident is apt to occur again and again from but slight causes. In general, the mobility of the luxated joint is much diminished ; the limb is either shortened or lengthened ; its contour is changed ; the injury is

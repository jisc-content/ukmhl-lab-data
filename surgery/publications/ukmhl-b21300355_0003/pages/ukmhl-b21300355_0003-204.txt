192 CALCULUS VESICA. paratus. Many useless, inapplicable, and highly dangerous machines have been produced, a few efl&- cient and perfectly safe. The three-branched instru- ment of Civiale takes its place at the head of the latter class. The knowledge of the fact that the curvature of the urethra can be effaced, and a perfectly straight instrument passed into the bladder with equal facility and freedom from uneasiness as a curved one, has facilitated very much the application of means for seizing and acting upon a stone in the bladder. The three-branched instrument, which it is unne- cessary to describe, as it can be readily seen and ob- tained, can be without difficulty brought in contact with the stone, the bladder being partially distended by urine, or filled to the requisite extent by tepid water injected through the outer canula of the ap- paratus. The branches are then so far expanded, and the drill withdrawn; and by a little cautious management, turning the instrument, altering the degree of expansion, and sounding with the drill, the stone is seized, and then fixed by pulling back the inner canula. By turning the drill with the fingers, and pulling back forcibly the inner canula so as to close the branches, the concretion may at once be pulverised ; or it may be again seized, and at- tacked by the drill on a different side. The opera- tion may, if necessary, be repeated after the lapse of eight or ten days, or sooner if the irritation caused by the former have subsided. Diluents are to be given so as to facilitate the washing out of tlie detri-

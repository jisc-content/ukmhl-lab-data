FRACTURE OF THE FEMUR. 301 thigh, with any satisfaction or credit, on the outside of the limb with the knee bent; however attentively the splints are placed, shortening, eversion of the foot, and deformity of the whole limb, are sure to follow. No greater absurdity and cruelty is con- ceivable than leaving the fracture unadjusted for weeks, making attempts to subdue consequent over- action, and then endeavouring to reduce and retain the bones at a period when otherwise they should have been firmly united. " Experience teacheth" not " fools," and cannot amend those whom prejudice has blinded. Compound fracture of the thigh, if circumstances do not forbid attempts to save the limb, is to be re- duced and retained in the same way as the simple, the wound being attended to, and means taken to subdue inflammatory action. Abscesses must be opened timeously, the limb must be equably support- ed, and the powers of the system preserved. The application of force may, in young persons, de- tach the epiphysis of the lower end of the femur, and displace it to a greater or less extent; and if the accident be not detected, the epiphysis will become consolidated with the shaft in this unnatural position, impairing the usefulness of the member, and probably laying the foundation for disease in or around the articulation. Reduction is easy, and the retentive treatment is the same as that recommended generally for fracture of the thigh near the knee-joint. I have met with one well marked case of this form of dias- tasis. A girl sustained an injury of the knee when

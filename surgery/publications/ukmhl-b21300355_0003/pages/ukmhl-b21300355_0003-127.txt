STRICTURE or THE URETHRA. 115 viously to its introduction. It is then passed softly along the canal till its progress is arrested ; thus the situation of the stricture is ascertained. Then a lit- tle more pressure is employed for a short time; if the instrument have not become insinuated into the constricted part, it will resiliate on removal of the pressure from its free extremity ; if it is passed into or beyond the stricture, it is firmly grasped by that part of the urethra, and retained ; thus we discover the degree of contraction ; and from the extremity of the bougie receiving and retaining the impression made thereon by the contracted part, we can form an accurate diagnosis regarding the nature and ex- tent of the stricture. The information thus acquired is afterwards acted on. Ball probes have been pro- posed for the examination of the urethra : they look well on paper, but are of no practical utility. The principles on which the cure is to be conduct- ed are the same in almost all cases ; but the particu- lars of the treatment must vary according to circum- stances. In slight cases, the gentle introduction of a moderately-sized bougie produces a cure by removing the irritability or susceptibility of the surface ; the re- laxed membrane is stimulated by the distension made with the bougie, and soon regains its natural tone. It may be necessary to repeat the introduction of the bougie a few times, at considerable intervals. In tight organic stricture something more is required ; the constricted part must be dilated gradually. Much dexterity and management is often required to pass an instrument through a tight stricture, particularly

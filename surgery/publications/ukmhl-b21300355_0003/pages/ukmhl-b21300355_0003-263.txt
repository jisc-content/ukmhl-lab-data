251 FRACTURES. hard. The callus is exuheimnt, much being required for the union of the fractured ends that overlap, and are perhaps far from being in contact; the vascular action and accompanying effusion are great, accord- ing to the necessity for them. The bone at the united part is enlarged to double its original thickness, or even to a greater size. After some time, the ends of the old bone, and part of the new deposit, are rounded olf by absorption of the protuberances, and the part becomes more shapely. When the ends of the bone are not well placed, or when they are moved occasionally whilst the uniting medium is still soft, there is danger of a false joint being formedâ€”the callus either giving way, or being all along imperfect, and the extremities at the soft part becoming smooth and movable on each other; or incited action may run high and terminate in sup- puration, with death or ulceration of portions of the bone. Fragments are sometimes entirely detached at the time of the accident, and perish at once ; or are so slightly connected with the shaft that they lose their vitality on the first accession of inflammation, become surrounded by purulent matter, part from their slight attachments, and come towards the surface. Or the shaft itself may be so bruised by the violence of the injury as to be incapable of resisting incited action, though slight. By malpractice, such untoward conse- quences as the preceding, and many others beside, are frequently induced. The uniting medium of separated bones remains soft for some time, as was already observed ; and

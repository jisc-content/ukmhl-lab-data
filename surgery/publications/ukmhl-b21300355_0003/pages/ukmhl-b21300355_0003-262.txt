FllACTUllES. 250 the bone is divided at the broken point into fragments, either small and loose, or large and adherent to the covering of the bone and other soft parts. Fracture may be comj)licated with wound or dis- placement of a neighbouring joint, and with lacera- tion of large bloodvessels and nerves. Unio7t of divided bones, as of soft parts, is preceded by incited circulation in the part, and effusion of or- ganisable matter. The extent of action is regulated by that of the injury, whether inflicted by accident or by operation. If the soft parts have not been much bruised, if the bone and its covering are merely sepa- rated and slightly displaced, and then speedily put in contact, the incited action and the effusion are limited to the divided parts. There is no irregularity after- wards at the point of fracture, the new matter that is not required being absorbed soon after deposition ; the bone is smooth and even as before. If, on the contrary, there is much displacement, and if that is not entirely removed, intense action ensues both in the soft and hard parts, there is great effusion of new matter, or callus, soft and yielding at first, but gra- dually becoming hard and denseâ€”bony particles being deposited from the vessels ramifying in the extremities, or in the attached fragments, of the old bone. When detached portions of callus are found lying in the soft parts, a piece of old bone which retained its vitality has formed the matrix of the deposit; the osseous substance has not been secreted from the arteries of muscles, cellular tissue, or mem- brane. In badly reduced fracture the swelling is great and

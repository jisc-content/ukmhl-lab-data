FRACTUllE OF THE FEMUK. 295 action of the muscles so far apart. The fracture is either oblique or transverse, according to the direc- tion of the force applied ; and the bruising and the degree of swelling are also dependent on the same circumstance. From transverse fracture fissure some- times extends, separating one or other condyle. The reparation of injury in the upper part of the femur is opposed by a variety of circumstances. Fractures of the neck of the bone are almost uni- formly met with in those whose powers of life have been nearly exhausted. The whole injury is confined within the synovial capsule, and the fibrous tissues which support that are unyielding, and but slightly vascular; consequently, in fracture of the neck of the femur, there occurs none of the swelling and in- creased vascularity of the surrounding tissues, which follow fracture of other bones, or other parts of this bone ; from this cause, support of the disunited parts is deficient. The head and neck of the bone are not so well supplied with bloodvessels as the other parts; those arteries which pass along the ligamentum teres are the chief support. And perhaps the influx of blood is not increased, in consequence of injury, to such a degree as in other parts ; in these, when the surrounding parts are bruised or otherwise injured by fracture in their immediate vicinity, their vascu- lar action is soon excited, the vessels ramifying on the periosteum are enlarged, and blood is poured into the bone at all points. Instead of these salutary changes, the secretion of synovia is increased, and a fluid, perhaps vitiated, surrounds the bone, and is in-

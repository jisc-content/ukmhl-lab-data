220 GONOimHCEA AND LEUCORRHCEA. the coloured menstrual discharge, and in many in- stances is substituted for it; it is always most violent after the menstrual period. In leucorrhoea there is generally neither heat nor pain during the passing of urine, and the colour of the discharge differs from that of gonorrhoea, though sometimes very slightly ; the stain of gonorrhoeal matter is yellow with a black border; leucorrhoeal is white or yellowish, but does not possess the latter characteristic. The application of leucorrhoeal matter will induce discharge from the urethra or from the external parts of some males, but the affection thus caused is perhaps not so violent, nor of so long duration, as that which arises from specific contagion. The effects of leucorrhoea on the system are very troublesome. There is general debility, dis- order of the stomach, pains of the back, sides, and limbs, a sallow bloodless complexion, paleness of the lips. It is often a cause, at other times a consequence, of miscarriage. Sometimes it is accompanied with a prolapsus uteri, sometimes with thickening of the os uteri. The discharge which attends ulceration of the parts, from whatever cause, is generally bloody, some- times it is thick and of a laudable aspect, sometimes thin and foetid. More or less discharge attends poly- pus, and is often profuse and coloured. In gonorrhoea the inflammation is usually limited to the external parts, but sometimes extends along the vagina. In neglected cases great tumefaction of the labia takes place, along with excoriation of the neigh- bouring parts, patchy ulceration around, and swell- ing of the absorbents and of the inguinal glands.

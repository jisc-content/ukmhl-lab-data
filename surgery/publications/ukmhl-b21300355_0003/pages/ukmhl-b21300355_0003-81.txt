69 AND NEIGHBOURHOOD. The precursory symptoms are soon followed by partial suppuration, and extensive sloughing of the cellular tissue. At first there is excitement of the system, but symptoms of debility, and flagging of the vital powers, soon present themselvesâ€”irregular pulse, delirium, disordered stomach, hiccough, vomiting, and cold extremities. The disease is one of great danger, and the patient can be saved only by free and early incision, and the judicious employment of sti- mulants. In some instances the inflammation is merely su- perficial, seated merely in the integuments, and fol- lowed by slow collection of matter. It is indeed seldom that a cavity formed by abscess near the anus fills up entirely, however large and free the opening into it may have been. The pari- etes contract, but the hardness around is not entirely dissipated ; the opening may close for a little while, but is soon found again discharging, and may con- tinue to do so for months or years. A sinus is thus formed. Fresh collections and openings, either ex- ternally or internally, are apt to occur, with extensive induration of the cellular tissue, and disease of the gut. Instead of a single sinus, a number of collate- ral ones are formed, all running into the main canal, like branches to a common sewer, or by-lanes open- ing into one spacious street. The disease is one of frequent occurrence amongst females ; and often from a false sense of delicacy its existence is not declared till it has advanced to a state of truly horrible per- fection.

280 FllACTUllE OF THE HUMERUS. sionally, when the violence has been great, either the upper or the lower fractured end is thrust through the skin. When the inferior part of the shaft is broken, there is less displacement than when the fracture is towards the middle of the bone. Fracture above the condyles sometimes extends through them ; and the one may be detached from the other, either with or without frac- ture of the shaft. When such an accident is sus- pected, the position of the condyles in regard to the ends of the bones of the forearm should be accurately observed. Flexion and extension of the forearm can be readily performed, though with pain ; not so, when the bones are luxated. Crepitation is detected along the line of fracture, during motion of the limb, and when the condyles are laid hold of and rao.ved upon each other, or on the shaft. In fracture of the middle of the shaft, coaptation is easily accomplished ; slight extension is made by one hand grasping the elbow, whilst, by the other, the bones are brought together, and the straightness and outline of the limb restored. The proper po- sition is readily maintained by two splints of book- binders' pasteboard, one applied from over the acro- mion process to beyond the point of the elbow, the other from the axilla, and also passing over the elbow on the inside; thus the neighbouring joints are fixed, and the muscles rendered inactive. The conjoined breadth of the sjilints should be sufficient to embrace the limb almost entirely; some space

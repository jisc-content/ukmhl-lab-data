FISTULA. 71 should ascertain, as accurately as possible, the extent and nature of the fistula ; and with this view, exa- mination with the probe is requisite. The probe is introduced into the canal, when the fistula is an ex- ternal one, and directed through its windings, so as to discover its direction, length, and divarications ; the guidance of the instrument is facilitated, and the information augmented, by the forefinger being placed in the rectum. Sometimes all the by-paths cannot be detected, until the orifice of the canal is enlarged. When the fistula is complete, the probe, entered at the external extremity, can be passed into the bowel so as to be felt by the finger in the rectum ; but it must be remembered, that the internal opening is not always at the inner termination of the sinus, but often seated more externally—the cellular tissue being destroyed to a considerable extent above it, so as to form a large unhealthy abscess, communicating with the main track of the fistula. But the gut may not be opened into, though denuded to a large extent, and forming part of the walls of the sinus ; and in some instances, the sinus may not come within a con- siderable distance of the bowel. An internal fistula is more difficult of detection. The symptoms leading to a suspicion of its existence are—puriform discharge from the bowel, increased on going to stool, and then accompanied with tenesmus ; pressure on the side of the anus causing pain, and sometimes an augmentation of discharge; and in many instances hardness, deeply seated, is felt. On introducing the finger into the rectum, the aperture

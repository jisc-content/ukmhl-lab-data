OF HERNIA. 37 must rest contented with relieving the stricture, then cover the parts with the integuments, and pro- mote union of the wound. If it be considered neces- sary to remove condensed and tuberculated omen- tum, it is cut off, and separate ligatures of fine silk are applied to every bleeding vessel on the cut sur- face ; the whole mass is not to be included in one noose, as was formerly the practice. In the operation for femoral hernia, the position and preliminaries are the same as for inguinal. A longitudinal incision is made from above the margin of Poupart's ligament to a little below the middle and most prominent part of the tumour. This is crossed by another at its lower extremity, the whole resem- bling in figure the letter T inverted; and the two flaps, so marked out, are reflected. Sometimes a single incision, from above the neck of the tumour to the lower border of it, is sufficient to afford room for the after proceedings. One layer is found covering the sac, furnished by the strong and dense cellular tissue which occupies the space under the crural arch and falciform process of the fascia lata; it is generally denominated the fascia propria, but has by some been described improperly as the sheath of the femo- ral bloodvessels.

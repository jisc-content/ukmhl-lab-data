FllACTUllE OF THE FEMUR. 293 Fracture is much more frequently met with out- side of the capsular ligament, generally passing obliquely through the trochanters, and communica- ting with fissures in various directions. Splinters are often detached, and sometimes the small trochan- ter is broken off. Here, also, there is inability to move the joint, violent pain on attempting it, swell- ing, and deformity of the member; there is shorten- ing to a greater extent than in the fracture within the capsule ; there is free motion in all directions; rotation, abduction, adduction, flexion, and often ex- tension, can be effected to an unnatural and unusual extentâ€”the degree of motion is no longer limited by the ligamentous attachments of the head of the bone. Here, also, the limb is most frequently everted, but occasionally inverted ; and that even when, from the direction and extent of the fracture, neither the rota- tors outwards nor the rotators inwards have been deprived of action. In some cases of fracture, partly within and partly without the capsule, all the usual marks of this in- jury are present, but it is impossible to move the limb without employing considerable force. This arises from the broken portions being jammed toge- ther, the neck of the bone being, as it were, driven into and wedged in the cancellated texture of the trochanter major, or of the upper part of the shaft. The trochanter major is sometimes, though rarely, detached, without separation of the neck of the bone from its shaft. In this injury there is apparent lengthening of the limb, and flattening of the hip;

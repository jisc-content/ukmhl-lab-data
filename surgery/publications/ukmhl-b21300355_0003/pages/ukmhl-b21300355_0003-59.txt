This desirable result may be assisted and hastened by gentle pressure ; and after the faecu- lent discharge has nearly ceased from the fistulous opening, the healing of this may be accelerated by the cautery lightly applied. It has been proposed to destroy the projecting septum between the two portions of bowel, either by ligature or by the pres- sure of forceps ; but this should not be attempted unless nature seems unable to effect a cure. The former method consists in including a considerable part of the septum in ligature, so as to induce con- densation of the parts by effusion of lymph, and de- struction of the projecting portion. This has not been found successful. The application of forceps presents a more rational expectation of cure. The external opening is dilated, and the situation of the septum ascertained. One blade of metallic forceps, with blunt serrated edges,—Dupuytren's,—is passed into the one intestinal orifice, and the other into the opposite ; the handles of the instrument are then approximated, locked, and fastened with a screw, and by means of the last-mentioned part of the apparatus the degree of pressure is regulated. Pain of the abdomen, furred tongue, loss of appe- tite, sickness, vomiting, and constitutional irritation, generally follow this proceeding, but gradually sub- side on the employment of enemata and fomenta- tions, and on lessening the pressure of the forceps. The septum cannot long withstand the continued com-

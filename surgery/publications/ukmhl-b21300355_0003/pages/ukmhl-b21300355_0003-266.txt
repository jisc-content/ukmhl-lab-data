254 FRACTURES. moval of the cause. There is also an impossibility,— not to mention the patient's sufferings,—of reducing bones to a good position some weeks after the acci- dent. Such practice has been extensively followed and recommended by some writers, even modern ; they set about reducing a fracture at a period after the accident, when, by proper treatment, union would have been completed, or at least far advanced. The confinement and suffering of the patient are increased threefold, and after all it is a bad cure, and there is a risk of false joint. In all fractures, whether simple or compound, comminuted or complicated, if an attempt is to be made to save the limb, let reduction be immediate ; coaptation and retention of the separated parts can- not be made too soon. A neglected case may be met with, in which the intensity of inflammatory action in all the tissues may forbid immediate interference. But even though inflammatory action has taken place to some extent, there are no surer means of arresting it than removal of its cause—the irregular ends of the bones being taken away from among the soft parts—provided it can be done without vio- lence or increase of tension. Reduction is facilitated by proper position of the limb, by relaxation of cer- tain sets of muscles. Extension and counter-exten- sion are made, but very little force required ; the sur- geon extends the limb with one hand, and resists with the other ; when the system is excited, and the muscles act spasmodically, an assistant is required to steady the limb, and to resist the extending po\rer which the surgeon employs. Then the position of

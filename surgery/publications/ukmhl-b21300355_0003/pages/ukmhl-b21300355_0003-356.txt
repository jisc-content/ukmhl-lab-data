LUXATION OF THE HIP-JOINT. 344 The head of the bone, when dislodged from the foramen obturatorium, may slip past the cotyloid cavity, for it is impossible to regulate its direction ; it comes to be acted upon by muscles which have been displaced, some being compressed and partially paralysed, whilst others are excited ; they have been put out of their usual condition and relation, and act irregularly. The head of the bone may, from this cause, get into the sacro-ischiatic notch, This has occurred to me ; but I have found no difficulty in removing it from thence, and effecting reduction satisfactorily. Displacement into the sacro-ischiatic notch is at- tended with great and remarkable inversion of the toes, slight shortening of the limb, and prominence of the head of the bone felt under the gluteus maxi- mus. It is the least common form of luxation. Re- duction is attempted by extension and rotation out- wards, at the same time pulling the head of the bone towards the ace abulum by means of a towel passed under the thigh. Luxation of the head of the femur on the pubes is perhaps more frequent than any other, excepting that on the dorsum of the ilium. The limb is not much shortened, the toes are everted, the trochanter major is depressed and nearer to the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium than usually, and the head of the bone is both seen and felt prominent in the groin. Much pain, swelling, and sometimes more or less paralysis of the limb, are occasioned by this displace- ment ; the femoral artery and vein lie immediately

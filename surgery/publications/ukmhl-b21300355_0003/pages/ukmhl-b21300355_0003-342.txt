330 LUXATION OF THE ELBOW-JOINT. sometimes a little to the ulnar side. The coronoid process occupies the cavity for the reception of the olecranon, and the head of the radius lodges behind the external condyle, the extremity is shortened, and looks twisted ; it is slightly flexed, and in the middle state between pronation and supination. Unnatural lateral motion can be produced, but flexion is imprac- ticable, the limb cannot be brought quite into the extended state, and rotation is difficult and painful. Swelling soon takes place, and consequently the hol- lows are filled up, and the processes of the bones ob- scured. Yet the olecranon and inner condyle can always be recognised and felt, and their relative po- sition ascertained ; the form of the end of the hume- rus, its hollows, and its prominences, can be distinctly discerned, both before and after the swelling, the soft parts being stretched over the bone ; and by rotating the limb with one hand, whilst the other is placed over the outer and back part of the joint, the situa- tion of the head of the radius is detected. Thus the relations of the bones to one another are dis- covered ; and this must be done at once, whatever pain may be produced by the examination, for it is a saving of suffering in the end. Yet the nature of this injury would seem difficult of detectionâ€”a fact scarcely intelligible by any one who is careful in liis manipulations, and who possesses common observa- tion, and a sound knowledge of anatomy. Many cases of unreduced luxation are met with ; I have seen it in both elbows of the same person ; and I have had a dozen of cases, in as many months, of unreduced elbows shown too late for attempts at re-

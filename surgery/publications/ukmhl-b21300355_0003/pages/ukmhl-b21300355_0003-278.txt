266 rilACTUUE OF THE Sl'lNK. curs from distension. Sometimes excitement of the viscus follows ; the secretions from its surface are increased, and often mixed with blood. Yet patients survive long under such circumstances, digestion and the other important functions are well performed, and the intellect is unimpaired. Prognosis in injuries of the spine is unfavourable, as well as in disease of the column, whether the result of injury or not. From the treatment much need not be expected ; but still no chance is to be thrown away, even in the most unfavourable cases. The attention must be directed towards alleviation of the symptoms. The comfort of the patient must be looked to in regard to the situation of the injured bones and other parts, even where there is reason to believe that the chord is lacerated or completely divided, and that there is no chance of recovery. In less severe cases, by pla- cing the injured parts in their proper position, and retaining them by splints placed along the sides of the spinous processes ;—by keeping down inflamma- tory action, palliating all the symptoms as much as possible, and attending to the state of the bladder if necessary—unlooked for recoveries have taken place. It has been proposed to treat the spine, in cases of severe and alarming fracture, in the same manner as the cranium—by trephining ; and some have recom- mended this in almost all kinds of injuries. I allude to the practice only to condemn it. And further notice of it is unnecessary, seeing that, as far as I know, it has been unanimously discarded by the pro- fession from amongst the list of surgical operations.

374 AMPUTATION OF THE FINGERS. wound, and removes the oflfending part. There is seldom any trouble from haemorrhage ; no ligatures are required. The flap is turned up so as to form a cushion over the exposed surface of the middle pha- lanx, and is retained so by the adhesive composition formerly mentioned, or by one or two turns of a linen bandage. The other method of operation is the reverse of the preceding. The joint is extend- ed, the bistoury is made to transfix close to the joint and at its posterior part, and by then carry- ing it downwards and forwards, as before, a similar flap is formed; this is retracted by an assistant, and with one sweep of the knife the articulation is di- vided from behind forwards. By either method the flap is the same. By similar procedure the amputa- tion at the middle articulation is performed. It is sometimes an object to save as much as pos- sible of the proximal phalanx, when amputation is rendered necessary by disease of the middle articu- lation, or of the distal extremity of the bone. In such cases, two semicircular flaps are made by cut- ting from without, either on the lateral, or on the thenal and anconal aspects, and the bone is divided either by a small saw or by the cutting pliers. The flaps are retained in apposition, and the bleeding arrested by bandaging. Amputation at the proximal articulation is also performed by double flap. In the previous operations an assistant steadies and supports the hand; in this he has likewise to bend the rest of the fingers, and to separate as widely as possible those neighbouring

It is not often that they remain in the pelvis or infundibula till they have become too large to descend ; in such cases they increase in their original situation, produ- cing, in general, much more uneasiness than had they reached the bladder. Or they may enter the ureters, and lodge in these canals, distending and obstructing them. The concretions may be caused by the lodgement of extraneous substances in the urinary passages. Foreign bodies introduced, even in the most healthy persons, are soon incrusted by calculous matter ; and the rapidity of the incrustation is in proportion to the tendency to the calculous diathesis. At first the deposit is generally of a brownish colour. Catheters retained in the bladder are soon blocked up by it. Needles, bodkins, leaden bullets, seeds of vegetables, kernels of fruit, &c., have been found forming nuclei to urinary calculiâ€”more frequently in females than in males, for obvious reasons. Some concretions are formed on the nucleus of condensed vitiated secretion from the mucous coat of the bladder, and partly consist of this deposit from the membrane. Such are generally of a dirty white colour, soft, friable, small, and numerous ; it is sel- dom that they are collected into masses of any con- siderable size. They are usually adherent to the mucous membrane, sometimes forming a broad and thin sheet covering it extensively; other stones, thougli composed of calculous deposit from the urine.

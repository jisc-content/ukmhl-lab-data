STRICTURE OF THE URETHRA. 117 struraent passed must be gradually increased : and, besides, the calibre of the canal varies much in dif- ferent individuals ; what is a full size for one person may be but a trifle in the urethra of another. The bougies are arranged by what is termed a size-plate or gage, a flat piece of steel, containing fifteen or six- teen circular perforations, which commence about the size of a small crow-quill, and gradually enlarge in diameter. These apertures are numbered, and the bougie which fills one has the corresponding number imprinted on it. By reference to the numbers, the surgeon is at once made aware of the progress he has made towards a cure. In the more common and simple cases, a regular and gradual ascent in this scale is all that is required, allowing a proper interval to elapse betwixt the intro- ductions. But in tight and unyielding stricture, small, firm, silver catheters are required. One of these of a size proportioned to the contraction of the canal—and the calibre often must be extremely minute—is pass- ed through the stricture or strictures by dexterous, persevering, and at the same time gentle pressure in the proper direction. If the diseased part be ante- rior to the bulb, it can be grasped between the fingers of the left hand, whilst with the right the instru- ment is insinuated into it; thus the part is steadied, and the course of the catheter made more certain and safe. If it be posterior, assistance in the introduc- tion, and information as to the direction and progress of the instrument are obtained by the forefinger of the left hand being placed in the bowel; and this is the

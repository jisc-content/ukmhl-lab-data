219 GONORRHCEA AND LEUCORHIICEA. the bladder, on the fore and lateral part of its neck, without interfering with the urethra. By the latter method the chance of incontinence remaining is diminished, but there is a risk of uri- nary infiltration, and this will require to be provided against by the use of a tube, as after the lateral ope- ration in the male. A staff is introduced, and by it the urethra is depressed towards the vagina. An incision is then made by the side of the crus clito- ridis, and through this the finger reaches the neck of the bladder, more by dilatation than by additional use of the knife. In one case I removed a very large stone by inci- sion. By a straight grooved staff the urethra was depressed; a straight blunt-pointed bistoury being slid along the groove, was carried upwards and out- wards, first on the left side, and then on the rightâ€” dividing the urethra and parts exterior, so as to form a track of wound, which, after dilatation, would admit of the ready passage of the stone. Extraction was easy. Incontinence continued for many months, but ultimately was in a great measure removed bypromo- ting farther contraction of the opening by the cautery. Gonori'hcea in females is often confounded with Leiicofi'hoea^ which is a very common complaint both in married and unmarried women. Leucorrhoea sometimes occurs at a very early period of life, at the age of ten or sooner ; and in such circumstances affections of the glandular and osseous systems often supervene. Frequently it precedes the accession of

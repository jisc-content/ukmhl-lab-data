401 EXCISION OF JOINTS. charge of remaining portions of diseased bone. The articulation could be seen through. The seton was gradually diminished, and the aperture closed. The foot was thus preserved, and the leg was but little shortened; the limb proved strong and extremely- useful, but the ankle-joint retained little power of motion. I have also trephined the os calcis and re- moved large portions of it; the cuboid likewise has been taken away, along with the base of the metacar- pal bone or bones in connexion with it; in some of these cases an excellent cure followed, in others amputation of the foot was afterwards necessary. Some have ventured to cut away the articulating ends of the bones composing the knee-joint. This may be accomplished without much difficulty. The patella is either removed entirely or turned to a side, the ligamentous and tendinous attachments are divi- ded, and the ends of the bones thus exposed ; by cutting close to and towards them, little risk is incur- red of wounding the bloodvessels and nerves in the popliteal space. The saw is readily applied in a hori- zontal direction. After tying the vessels, and approxi- mating the edges of the wound, the limb is placed in the straight position, and retained fixedly so by the application of splints. Much constitutional disturb- ance is to be expected, as well as profuse and tedious suppuration. There are few surgeons so rash as to have recourse to this operation. One or two patients, it is true, have lived in spite of it, retaining the limb in a tolerably useful state. But in others,—and these constitute the majority,—amputation was after all PART III. 2 c

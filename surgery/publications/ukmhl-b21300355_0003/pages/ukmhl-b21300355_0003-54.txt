OF HERNIA. 42 tumour, or in the mesial line at its lower aspect. The stricture is then divided with care, the parts reduced, the wound approximated, and a compress applied. Opening the tumour throughout its whole extent is hazardous and unnecessary. The contents of hernia are often in a very bad state, either dark-coloured throughout, or studded with dark tender spots. Often lymph is effused all over the parts, gluing them to one another, and to the sac. This effusion, which generally takes place to the greatest extent at the neck of the sac, is a wise provision made by nature against the accidents of the disease ; inasmuch as a barrier is thereby formed between the cavity of the abdomen and the extruded parts, preventing, in a great measure, the destruction of the latter from affecting the abdominal viscera. For example, a portion of protruded intestine sloughs, the faeculent matter is effused, and had not this ad- hesion to the neck existed, the gut might have slip- ped back into the abdomen, its contents would have escaped there, and a fatal result would have been the inevitable consequence. Still, notwithstanding the salutary effusion, the bowel may ulcerate at its upper part, and giving way within the belly, produce rapid death. The bowel, where embraced by the stricture, is contracted and thickened, and dilated above. At the lower part of this dilatation the coats are apt to give way by ulceration, even after incision of the constricting parts. The contraction does not disap- pear quickly. In some cases it continues to such an extent as to keep up obstructions to the faical matter, and cause a fatal issue from this cause alone.

284 FRACTURF. OF THE OLECRANON. charge of increased and vitiated synovial secretion takes place, followed by profuse and unhealthy sup- puration. The cartilages ulcerate, and then the bones- The cellular tissue around becomes infiltrated, the parts swell and are dis'coloured, and collections of matter form probably .at more points than one ; per- haps there is a succession of abscesses. The con- dyles, and often a portion of the shaft of the bone, are denuded by the suppuration, and superficial ne- crosis results. Ultimately the patient grows hectic. Amputation had to be resorted to in all the cases which have come under my observation, weeks or months after the accident. Union of the simple fracture will take place by bone, if the portions be retained accurately and per- manently in contact; but there is a risk of the joint remaining stiff, and of re-separation being produced by even slight violence. Union by ligament is as rapid as that by osseous matter ; and if the liga- ment is short, the arm is quite as useful. Approxi- mation of the broken surfaces is favoured by exten- sion of the elbow joint, the triceps muscle being thus relaxed. The position is preserved by a splint placed on the fore part of the limb, extending from the middle of the arm to the lower part of the fore- arm, and retained by a roller applied, not over-tight, from the fingers upwards. The application of appa- ratus to the separated portion, with the view of for- cinjr it into contact with the shaft of the ulna, is use- less. The figure of 8 bandage, and such like, are

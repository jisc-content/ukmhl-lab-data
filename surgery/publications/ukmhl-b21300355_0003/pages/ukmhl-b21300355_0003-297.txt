F«ACTU11E OF THE FOREARM. 285 hurtful. Permanent relaxation of the triceps, with prevention of motion, is sufficient. This is continued for three or four weeks ; by that time the fracture will in all probability have united, and then gentle and gradual passive motion of the joint is to be com- menced. In compound fracture the prognosis is always un- favourable. Means must be taken to avert incited action—the limb must be properly placed without delay, the edges of the wound accurately approxi- mated, and antiphlogistic measures pursued. Puru- lent collections must be opened early. Rest of the joint is to be ensured, and support afforded, by ban- daging—perhaps by the application of plasters and a splint. The patient will be fortunate if he escape mutilation by the amputating knife. Fractures of the bones of the forearm^ of one or both, are common ; generally simple. The Radius may be broken at various points—at the upper part— near its head—at the middle—most frequently near the distal extremity. At the two first points the fracture will probably have been produced by direct violence ; but near the carpus, it is usually the result of force applied to its extremity, as by falls in which the weight of the body is thrown on the palm of the hand. The ulna is usually broken by force directly applied, as when the arm is brought in contact with hard bodies in falls. By direct violence also, both bones may give way about the middle, and at cor- responding points ; or, when force is applied in the

IIETENTION OF URINE. 129 bladder, or into the prostatic portion of the urethra, and there acting like a valve, causes much more for- midable obstruction to the flow of urine than does enlargement of the lateral lobes; and the obstruc- tion is the more complete the greater the distension of the bladder. At first, this lobe is but slightly pro- minent, and of a conical form ; but as it enlarges, its regularity of shape disappears, the tumour is nodu- lated, and in general somewhat pyriform. The affec- tion is seldom met with, unless in old people. In consequence of prostatic enlargement, pain is felt in perineo, with occasional throbbing, and a sense of weight; there is frequent desire to make water, the bladder is irritable and discharges ropy mucus. There is more or less irritation of the lower bowels; there is an almost constant desire to empty the rectum, from a feeling of fulness there, and pain, often severe, is felt on going to stool; when the enlargement is great, the bowel is considerably compressed, and the faeces, when solid, are passed flattened like portions of tape. Frequently there is thin mucous discharge from the urethra. In making water, the urine, as it were, hesitates, and after a while passes away at first in drops, and afterwards in a scanty and irregular stream ; pain is felt at the point of the penis, in the loins and hips, and often in the inside of one or both thighs. On attempting to pass the catheter, its extremity is obstructed in the prostatic region, and the swelling can be felt by the finger introduced into the anus. Examination PART III. I

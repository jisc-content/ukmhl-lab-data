AMPUTATION AT THE SHOULDER-JOINT. 387 vided ill the formation of the flap are small, and the axillary is not cut till the incisions are nearly com- pleted ; as soon as the limb has dropped, the surgeon places his finger on the mouth of the artery, and then applies his ligature as quickly as possible ; the pres- sure may now be removed, and the minor vessels secured leisurely. The flap covers the wound com- pletely, and is easily retained. Or two flaps may be made by transfixion. In opera- ting thus on the right limb, the surgeon, standing in front of the patient, enters the knife a little below the point of the acromion, passes it across the outer as- pect of the joint, and by inclination of the handle outwards, makes its point to appear on the inside of the outer margin of the axilla; by carrying it down- wards and outwards to a sufficient extent, the outer flap is formed. This is immediately elevated by an assistant, and then the arm is pushed upwards, and across the chest, so as to render the joint more acces- sible ; the ligaments are cut, the bone disarticulated, the knife passed beyond its head, and placed with the edge parallel to the shaft of the humerus, and the arm restored to its former position; the inner flap is then made, by carrying the instrument down- wards and inwards. In the left limb, the knife is entered on the inside of the outer border of the axilla, and brought out below the extremity of the acromion, reversing the order of the former incisions ; after the outer flap has been so formed, the joint is cut across, the knife passed beyond the head of the bone, and an inner flap made, as before. Accidental injury, as already stated, is the most

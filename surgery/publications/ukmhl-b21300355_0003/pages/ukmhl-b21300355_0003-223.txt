211 CALCUI-US VESICiE. will probably be sufficient, though at an interval of many months. It has been proposed to divide the operation into two parts, with an interval of several days between ; first to make the incisions, leaving the stone undis- turbed, and after suppuration has been fairly esta- blished, and the parts become relaxed, then to extract the foreign body, provided it have not in the mean time been discharged spontaneouslyâ€”in short, to perform the operation a deux temps. This method is liable to serious objections. Two operations must in general be more severe than one. The patient is rendered despondent and miserable after the first, by knowing that the object of his suffering has been imperfectly accomplished, or rather not accomplished at all. Much, and often serious irritation is produced by the wounded bladder being contracted on the hard and rough foreign body; patients have sunk under this torture. The cure is tedious. From the earliest times it has been quite well understood, that when the stone cannot be got out it must be left in; but the proposal of always leaving it in, on principle and not from necessity, is really absurd. There is room for suspecting that this mode of operation originated as a virtue from necessity; the extraction of the stone is always the most difficult part of lithotomy, requiring much skill and dexterity, and the operator, finding himself baffled in his attempts to effect it, wisely desists from his futile efforts at the time, and waits for another opportunity. This is certainly better practice than the using of much force, or di-

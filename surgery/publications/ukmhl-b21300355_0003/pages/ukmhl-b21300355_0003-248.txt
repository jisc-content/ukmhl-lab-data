236 LlGATUlli: OF EXTERNAL ILIAC. copper spatula?, to keep the parts aside ; and a serre- noeud may assist in the securing of the noose. Aneurism in the Groin is not uncommon, and is very easily recognised. The old operation has been attempted, and unsuccessfully. Ligature has been placed on the distal side of the tumour, with no fa- vourable result. One horrid example of the latter operation is on record, in which the femoral artery had been completely obliterated spontaneously, and nerves, vein, and portions of the muscles, were all in- cluded in ligature, by one random thrust of a sharp needle. The external iliac is to be tiedâ€”a proceeding now regarded as one of the regular operations of sur- gery, and likely to ensure a favourable result. It was first undertaken in a case of secondary bleeding after ligature of the femoral, and since, has often been per- formed for the cure of inguinal aneurism, with almost uniform success. The incisions are made in the same direction as recommended for ligature of the common and internal: illiacs, but not nearly so exten- sive. This is preferable to incision, either in the di- rection of the vessel, or of a semilunar form with one of the corners pointing upwards ; the abdominal muscles are less weakened, less injury being inflicted to the muscles, and no troublesome bloodvessels are encountered. The artery is well circumstanced for the application of ligature, affording a considerable extent without the giving off of any branches. It is easily exposed by cautious separation of the celki- lar tissue, and the ligature is secured either towards

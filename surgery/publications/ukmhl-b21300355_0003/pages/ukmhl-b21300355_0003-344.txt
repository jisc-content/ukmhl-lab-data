332 LUXATION OK THE "WRIST. but when the limb is extended, the olecranon is drawn upwards. In luxation of both bones, reduction is much faci- litated by position of the arm. The arm and fore- arm are extended, and the limb is brought well be- hind the trunk, so as to relax the triceps ; then the surgeon performs extension and counter-extension, pulling the forearm with one hand, whilst he pushes with the other placed on the scapula. If the force thus employed prove insufficient, as it seldom will in recent cases, the patient may be placed on his face, on a couch, and on the limb being brought into the favourable position already noticed, counter-exten- sion may be made by the heel planted against the in- ferior costa of the scapula, whilst the wrist is pulled with both hands. It is seldom necessary to employ ^ pulleys, excepting in cases of old standing; if so, the only peculiarity in their application to this joint is the direction of the force, backwards. And this I consider to be a very material part of the manipula- tions, for, by attention to it, I have succeeded after previous failures,â€”after great force had been applied, causing excoriation and swelling of almost the whole limb. In luxation of the radius, flexion and pro- nation, combined, if necessary, with extension, will generally effect replacement. Dislocation at the Wrist, is very unfrequent. The articulation is naturally strong, admitting of little motion, the bones being accurately fitted to each other, whilst the retaining ligamentous appara- tus is both copious and unyielding; on this account

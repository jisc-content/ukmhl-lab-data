OF HERNIA. 19 intestinal contents; the viscera in the sac have not due support and pressure, hence accumulations take place in them, and may be productive of serious and even fatal effects. No protrusion, in which these cir- cumstances are likely to occur, should be allowed to exist if possible. So afraid were the ancients of al- lowing hernias to remain unreduced, that it was their custom to cut all patients labouring under rupture who would submit to the operation ; and this was generally performed by itinerant quacks. They re- turned the protrusion without opening the sac, and then the neck of the tumour was either stitched up, or tied along with or without the spermatic chord. The actual cautery, and the most powerful caustics, were also applied to the parts by some, and dreadful were the eflfects; yet after the neck of the sac had been destroyed, and perhaps the bone exposed and exfoliated, protrusion again took place by the side of the cicatrix. By many, castration was considered necessary for the cure of scrotal hernia. Such harsh measures were founded on erroneous and imperfect ideas of the nature of the disease, and are not to be met with in the present day. Operations for unin- carcerated hernia are not justifiable, and those who have operated in such circumstances give a very de- sponding account of the experiment. The external applications employed to reduce her- nia are various. Some are supposed to produce cor- rugation of the integuments, and contraction of the cremaster muscle, and thereby to force up the pro- truded intevStine; others are of an astringent charac-

This proceeding I consider quite safe in the hands of an experienced surgeon, one well acquainted with the urinary passages—but not otherwise. It is in every way preferable to puncture of the bladder above the pubes, to puncture behind the prostate, or to puncture of the prostate along with wound of the rectum. As before noticed, I never have had occasion to puncture the bladder but once—then it was above the pubes, and for an imusual affection of the blad- der, the particulars of which have been already de- tailed. The result of the experience of several emi- nent surgeons, both in this country and abroad, is similar. Elastic gum catheters have been recommended in this affection, and it is said that after the instrument has been passed to the prostatic region, its entrance into the bladder is facilitated by gently withdrawing the stilet, the point of the catheter being thereby cur- ved upwards, and, as it were, lifted over any central projection of the prostate that mayimpede its straight- forward introduction.

LUXATION OF THE WlllST. 334 ligamentous tissue, perhaps combined with fracture of the bony processes to a greater or less extent, must have taken place to admit of displacement; in con- sequence violent inflammation is to be expected, and means must be taken to avert it. On account of this laceration, also, mere reduction is not sufficient, retentive apparatus must be applied ; as soon as the limb has been made straight, a pasteboard splint is to be applied on each side, as in fracture of the fore- arm, and retained with a roller, a wooden splint being placed exteriorly until the pasteboard hardens. This precautionary measure is also necessary to avert re- displacement in dislocation of the radius singly; in both accidents the apparatus should be retained for at least a fortnight. Afterwards, passive motion, gradually increased and combined with friction, is requisite to prevent stiffness of the joint. In mere sprain of the wrist, large swelling soon forms anteriorly, from extravasated blood, resembling somewhat projection of the bones, and so leading towards fallacy in diagnoses ; indeed it is not unrea- sonable to suppose that dislocation here does not occur so frequently as is imagined. Fracture also near the distal extremity of the radius, an accident formerly mentioned as exceedingly common from falls on the hand, is very apt to be mistaken for lux- ation. On this accovmt, and because in every injury of the wrist the parts are soon obscured by bloody swelling, there is a strong necessity for early and accurate examination. Subluxation not unfrequently occurs ; in other words, the attachments of the bones of the forearm to

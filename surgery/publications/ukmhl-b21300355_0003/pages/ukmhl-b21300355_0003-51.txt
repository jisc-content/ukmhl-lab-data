OF HERNIA. 39 only the nail of the finger can be insinuated into it; and this organ is a better and safer conductor for the knife than a grooved director. The edge of the stric- ture is felt very sharp; the point of the finger is turned towards the pubes, and along it a narrow, blunt- pointed, curved bistoury is passed in close contact, and with the edge towards the pubes ; its mere point is pushed beyond, and then the position of the blade is changed, its back is turned upon the finger. This slight motion is often sufficient to relieve the constriction on the protruded parts, and permit their reduction; if not, a few more fibres are cut by raising the handle of the knife gently from the palm of the hand. The di- rection of this incision is towards the tuberosity of the pubes, inwards and forwards. Thus only the cres- centic portion of the crural arch is cut; and the divi- sion of this produces sufficient relaxation of the neigh- bouring parts. There is danger in cutting directly forwards, particularly in the male, at least if the inci- sion be made to any considerable extent; there is a risk of wounding the chord, and the obturator artery has been met with in a few instances coursing round the neck of the sac. This distribution of the artery, however, is rare, and can occur only when the epi- gastric and obturator arise by a long common trunk, and even then it may not encircle the neck of a hernia, as I have witnessed. Occasionally a vessel passes round the opening, connecting the epigastric with the obturator, when these arteries follow their usual course ; and this also may surround the neck of the sac. If vessels should exist in this situation in a

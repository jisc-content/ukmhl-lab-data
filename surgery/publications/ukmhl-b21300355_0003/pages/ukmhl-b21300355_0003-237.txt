225 VESICO-VAGINAL FISTULA. sloughs, the urine escapes, perhaps six or eight days after delivery ; or the anterior surface of the vagina, and the coats of the posterior and lower part of the bladder, have been lacerated by the imprudent use of the crotchet, or some such crooked and awkward tool; then the escape of urine is immediate. The unnatural flow continues, diminishing after a time, and if the opening be at first not large, and have gradually contracted, ultimately it may escape in but small quantities, at least during the recumbent pos- ture. Of course, the size and site of the opening are very various. I have been consulted in some dread- ful cases, incurable and loathsome—the consequence of most culpable neglect and ignorant rudeness on the part of the accoucheur ; the bladder without any part of its posterior fundus, rent so as to admit the fingers ; the rectum also torn extensively—in some, merely a shred of the sphincter remaining; faeces and urine constantly mixing in one vast offensive cavity. But in general the opening is in the neck of the bladder immediately behind the commencement of the urethra, and nearly in the mesial line; some- times it is considerably further back. It can be felt by the finger, and is readily seen by means of a pro- per speculum, a copper spatula being at the same time used to prevent the folds of the vagina from interrupting the view; the speculum opened by handles attached to the blades, and prevented from shutting by a serrated semicircular plate interposed, is the most convenient and suitable.

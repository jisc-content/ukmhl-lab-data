384 AMPUTATION OF THE AIllM. able. The precaution, however, of making the second ti-ansfixion considerably lower than the first I have found quite effectual. The disparity between the bases of the flaps is readily and quickly remedied, after their formation, by a sweep of the knife up- wards on the lower side. The formation of neuromata occurs more frequent- ly after the amputations of the arm and forearm than in any other. The disease, however, is less common than formerly, and this may be fairly attributed to the improvements in the operation—to the method by flaps having superseded the circular, and nothing but the arteries being surrounded in ligature. Still the aftection is occasionally met with, and there can be none more painful and troublesome. Generally, no obvious cause can be found for its attack; but in some of the cases there would seem to be a constitu- tional and innate tendency, as it were, towards the formation of such tumours—as in the following case : A gentleman, aged 53, underwent amputation of the thumb, in consequence of laceration of the hand. Amputation was very soon afterwards performed at the middle of the forearm, on account of haemorrhage and infiltration of the hand, after fruitless attempts to secure the arteries. After cicatrisation of the wound, he complained of great pain in the stump, and in the situation where the tourniquet had been applied. Amputation of the arm was then perform- ed, but the stump was not w^ell made. The pain returned, and he applied to me, with the view of again submitting to amputation. It was performed nearer to the shoulder-joint, and in order to guard

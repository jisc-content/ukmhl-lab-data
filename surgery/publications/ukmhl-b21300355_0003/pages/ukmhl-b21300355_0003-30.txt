Bandages were applied, and great pain thereby occasioned. After his return to this country, pain in the belly and vomiting seized him on a Monday morning, and continued with more or less violence till Sunday. Then the vomiting be- came foeculent, the belly excruciatingly painful and tender, the tumour tense, and the pulse weak. A phy- sician opposed operative measures, having been con- vinced that his former complaint was a hydrocele of the chord. But I conceived the symptoms warranted cutting down on the parts, and did so. A hernia was found containing omentum and a fold of bowel; a hydrocele of the chord lay alongside of it. Crural hernia has been mistaken for bubo, and vice vei'sa. Lumbar abscess and varix of the femoral vein are also supposed to resemble it in some mea- sure. The situation and form of the tumour in lum- bar abscess is very different from those of hernia; and the mode of examination recommended in regard to cirsocele is equally applicable to the detection of dilated femoral vein. The distinctions between crural hernia and bubo are too obvious to require mention. Patients with unreduced hernia are constantly in great danger ; bruising of the swelling, or accumu- lation of foeces in the protruded bowel, are likely to occasion very unpleasant consequences. They are generally troubled with indigestion, flatulence, and constipation; a slight degree of constriction at the neck of the tumour produces an obstruction to the

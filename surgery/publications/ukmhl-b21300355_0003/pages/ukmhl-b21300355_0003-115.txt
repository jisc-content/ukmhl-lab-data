INFLAMMATION OF THE BLADDER. 103 ureters and pelves of the kidneys, causing violent pains in the loins, nausea, occasional vomiting, and colicky affections. In very violent cases lymph is effused on the inner surface of the bladder, and may become organised ; but such effusion is rare. I met vi^ith one remarkable instance of it in my own practice, and have seen several others. An old pensioner fell from a scaf- folding, during his late Majesty's visit to this city. He sustained a severe contusion of the back, and retention of urine came on ; his urine was drawn off regularly for some weeks, but then severe pelvic symptoms supervened, and at last nothing but a small quantity of purulent matter flowed through the catheter. The symptoms became urgent, the bladder was very much distended, and rose to the umbilicus ; all endeavours to evacuate the urine per urethram failed, the instrument being always closed by thick pus, and I was obliged to open the blad- der above the pubes. Much purulent matter mixed with foetid urine escaped from the wound, as also a false membrane which invested the mucous coat of the viscus. The membrane was of a flocculent ap- pearance, in some places distinctly fibrous, in others thin and transparent; and its internal surface was irregular, as if from the deposition of minute granules of recent lymph. The patient died exhausted, after having survived about three weeks, voiding his urine partly by the wound, and partly per urethram. It should perhaps be mentioned, that those who saw him immediately after the accident supposed that

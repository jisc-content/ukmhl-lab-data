The appearance of the contents varies according to the time which has elapsed betwixt their discharge and the occurrence of the extravasation ; if short, coagula float in a thin bloody fluid; if considerable, the li- quid is thick, dark, and putrid. Bloody effusion into the scrotal cellular tissue produces a dark appearance of the integuments, and the swelling has a doughy feel. At one or more points, where the cells are broken down and much blood has collected, fluctuation is perceived more or less distinct. The treatment consists of rest, the recumbent posture, support of the swelling on a small cushion, and the employment of fomentation when the parts are painful. The absorption proceeds slow- ly ; and after some time, when all painful feelings have ceased, stimulant embrocation may be used, with the view of expediting it; a solution of the mu- riate of ammonia, of the sulphate of alumina, or of other astringent stimulating salts, may be employed in strength proportioned to the feelings of the patient and the progress of the case. If the tumour sud- denly become painful, and increase in size, indicating putrefaction of the blood, and commixture of it with puriform matter, a free incision is to be made, and poultices applied. When the parts have become quiet, and suppuration been established, poulticing is to be discontinued, and mild and light dressing employed. When, on tapping a hydrocele, the fluid is found to

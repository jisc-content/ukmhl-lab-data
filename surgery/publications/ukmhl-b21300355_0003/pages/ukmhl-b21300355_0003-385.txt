AMPUTATION OF THE FINGERS. 373 to curtail the length of the bone. It may sometimes succeed tolerably well when there is but one bone; when there are two, it is altogether vile and inad- missible. Various accidents and diseases require removal, either primary or secondar}'^, of the fingers, or of parts of them. Amputation is most easily accomplish- ed at the articulations, and ought therefore always to be performed at these joints, when the circumstances of the case permit. The last phalanx may require removal either on account of severe injury, or from incurable disease, as onychia maligna, necrosis, caries, &c. The operatidn is one by single flap, and may be conducted in one of two ways. The doomed phalanx is grasped, on its anterior and posterior aspects, by the fore and middle fingers of the left hand; and the articulation is flexed almost to the full extent, in order that incision into it may be faci- litated. A straight, narrow, and sharp-pointed bis- toury is carried in a semicircular sweep over the fore part of the joint, so as to divide the integuments, and open completely the articulating cavity. The remain- ing ligamentous investments of the joint are divided by one or more additional touches of the knife, so as to loosen the base of the phalanx. The fingers of the left hand are then changed from the fore and back parts of the phalanx to its sides, the edge of the knife is passed behind the base of the bone, and the sur- geon, by carrying the blade forwards and downwards, forms a flap of sufficient dimensions to cover the

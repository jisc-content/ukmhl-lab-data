FRACTURE OF THE LEG. 308 are not much displaced. Sometimes the foot is vio- lently concussed in consequence of a fall from a height, and, though no fracture may have occurred, the pa- tient is equally lame and pained ; severe inflamma- tion is sure to supervene rapidly, and may terminate untowardly. Fracture of the upper part of the tibia is to be treated in the straight position, for it has been al- ready observed, that when the knee is bent the upper portion necessarily projects. A hollowed splint of wood, extending from the middle of the thigh to near the heel, is applied behind, whilst one of paste- board is placed on each side : all are secured by ban- daging, the foot and lower part of the limb being rolled previously to prevent infiltration; by this simple apparatus motion of the knee-joint, and of the ends of the bones on each other, is completely pre- vented ; the heel is raised, if necessary, for complete adaptation. Fractures of the middle and lower portions of the bones are treated most advantageously, whether sim- ple or compound, in the bent position, the angle being made more or less obtuse, according to the degree of flexion most conducive to easy reduction and reten- tion. Extension is made on the limb, and the parts brought into as natural and handsome a shape as possible ; and in doing so, the appearance of the sound member should be kept in view. There is seldom any difficulty in accom])lishing reduction; the ex- tending and counter-extending power need be but

The proceeding is, besides, not dangerous ; for effusion of lymph takes place to a con- siderable extent above the part grasped by the forceps, gluing the portions of bowel firmly to each other, and forming a new barrier against any of the faecu- lent matter escaping inwardly. Attempts may be made to repair the loss of substance in the skin by paring the edges of the opening, and affixing a flap taken from the neighbourhood. There is a greater chance of recovery from the in- convenience of artificial anus after hernia than after wounds. If the opening in the bowel be near the stomach, the patient will die from inanition. When it is lower in the intestinal tube, nutrition is more perfect, and the patient can be further supported by nutritive enemata. When no natural cure is likely to take place, the inconvenience will be palliated by a truss with a soft pad being worn, so as to retain the faeces till a favourable opportunity occurs for evacu- ation ; or a soft plug of lint may be inserted into the aperture, and retained by a compress and roller. Prolapsus of the mucous membrane of the gut some- times takes place through the artificial anus, and is reduced with difficulty. The use of a truss or tent, already mentioned, will tend to prevent the occur- rence. Great attention to cleanliness is required when the opening cannot be closed. Operations for other kinds of hernia, if discovered during life, are to be conducted on similar principles with those for inguinal and crural. The surgeon 5

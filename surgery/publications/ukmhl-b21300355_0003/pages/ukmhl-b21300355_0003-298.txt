286 FRACTURE OF THE FOREAIiM. direction of the bones, the ulna may be found broken near the wrist, and the radius near the elbow. When one bone is broken, there is little displace- ment. The power of motion is lost to a consider- able degree, and there is some deformity, but little or no shortening. The existence of fracture is ascer- tained by tracing the bones with the fingers, and by gently rotating the limb ; the broken portions mo- ving on each other produce distinct crepitation. When the radius is broken near its middle, the fore- arm is kept pronated, and the broken extremities are drawn towards the ulna; by bringing the limb towards the supine position, the ends come together, and the one bone is removed from the other. Frac- ture of the radius near the distal extremity produces displacement of the wrist, with great deformity ; and this is increased by bloody effusion into the sheaths of the tendons, and into the superficial cellular tis- sue. In fracture of both bones, there is much defor- mity and shortening of the limb ; the power of mo- ving the hand is lost; the muscles are bruised and torn, and great swelling soon results. There is little difficulty in remedying the slight displacement which takes placp when but one bone is broken, and in retaining tl^ parts in a favourable position. When both have given way, slight exten- sion is required, and the forearm is placed in the middle state between pronation and supination. Two pasteboard splints, softened in hot water, and padded with tow, are applied, one on each aspect, from a little above the elbow to over the fingers ; the outer

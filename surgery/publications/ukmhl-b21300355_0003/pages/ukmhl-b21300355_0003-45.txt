OF HERNIA. 33 ill cold or warm applications; and, for my part, I should never advise tobacco. If the tumour is not very tender, make one good trial of the taxis, not long continued ; and if a warm bath can be readily commanded, place the patient in it, and employ the taxis when he begins to feel faint. If foiled, and if the patient can bear depletion well, the strangulation being recent, try a full bleeding to syncope; it may save depletion afterwards, and at all events the patient will be no worse of it. Having failed, as may probably be the case, operate without delay. The operation is neither formidable nor dangerous of itself; the delaying of it is attended with the most serious and irretrievable mischief. It ought to be performed within a very few hours after the occur- rence of strangulation, and, in most instances, with- out putting off time with the means considered auxi- liary to the taxis. Under urgent circumstances, it may be necessary to operate within a quarter of an hour after seeing the patient, as I have often done. In ordinary cases, time must be taken to converse with the patient and his friends, to convince them that all those means likely to assist reduction, and render an operation unnecessary, have been tried. The surgeon must not appear to be in a hurry, though he puts off no time unnecessarily, otherwise his mo- tives may be misconstrued. The necessity for operating early is greater in small than in large hernise, in crural than in inguinal. The groin and neighbouring parts are to be shaved, and PART III. c

OF HERNIA. 20 ter, and their administrator may gravely believe and say, that by them he exjjects to tan the living scrotum, to reduce the hernia, and to present an insuperable obstacle to its reproduction. But all such means are visionary, and practically ineffectual; no external or internal remedy can attenuate and reduce the hernial sac, remove adhesion, or produce contraction of the tendinous and rigid apertures. Herniae are either reducible ox irreducihle. A hernia is said to be reducible, when the protruded bowel or viscus readily returns into the abdomen on the appli- cation of pressure to the swelling, or on the patient assuming the recumbent posture. When recent, the swelling may not be made to disappear without con- siderable difficulty, but after the disease has become of long duration, the aperture through which the pro- trusion has taken place dilates and is relaxed, and admits of the ready passage of the hernial contents ; such tumours are usually of considerable size. -But reducible herniae should not be permitted to enlarge, since their protrusion can be prevented by simple and safe means; after reduction, a properly fitted bandage, termed Truss, is applied over the aperture and canal, and by the compression thus made, the opening is rendered impervious to the abdominal viscera. In inguinal hernia, the pad of the truss must make equable compression over the whole of the canal; in the other species, the aperture is less extensive, and the pressure more direct. Perseverance in the use of a well-adapted truss is highly necessar)'^ in children from the first, so that a chance may be afforded of

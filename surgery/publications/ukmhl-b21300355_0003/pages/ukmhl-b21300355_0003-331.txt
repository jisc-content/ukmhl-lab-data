LUXATION OF THE LOWER JAW. 319 partially opened, the chin is twisted to a side, and immovable. Great pain is experienced from the pressure of the condyles of the bone on the temporal muscles, from stretching of the fibres of the ptery- goids, and from interruption to the functions, by pressure, of the contiguous bloodvessels and nerves. Mastication is impossible, the speech is altered, and indeed articulation may be said to be impracticable. It is supposed by the vulgar, that the accident is particularly apt to happen to infants and young per- sons. Nurses are in consequence careful, when a child yawns, to support the chin, and pronounce an accom- panying blessing. The articulating cavity is then shallow, yet luxation must be rare in young sub- jects. In my own experience no instance of dislo- cated jaw has occurred but in adults ; and then, either from over-opening of the jaws, or from power- ful muscular action during depression of the inferior maxilla. The nature of the injury is at once known ; and the displacement is easily remedied. But I have met with instances where, through ineffectual attempts at reduction, the unnatural position has been allowed to continue for many hours, to the great distress of the individual. The object in view is to depress the ramus—one or both, as may be—and to raise the chin. This is effected by pressure with the thumbs on or in the situation of the molar teeth, whilst with the fingers the jaw is moved upwards and back- wards. The thumbs need not be protected by a glove, as is generally recommended ; on the bone re-

FRACTURE OF THE HUMERUS. 282 In compound fracture similar splints are applied, after due attention has been paid to the wound and to the position of the hon^. The patient is placed on his back in bed; and the splints are retained by slips of bandage, double, one end being passed through the loop and secured to the other by a run- ning noose. This method of deligation affords fa- cility for the removal of the splints, in order to examine into the state of the limb and dress the wound. It also permits of the apparatus being slacked in the first instance during the swelling, and of being afterwards tightened, without lifting the limb or disturbing its position. Fracture at the distal extremity of the humerus is managed most conveniently with the limb in the straight position. The fragments are placed accu- rately together, and one splint placed on the fore part, another posteriorly. The forearm is kept in a state of supination. At the end of about twenty days the apparatus should be removed, and the position of the articulation changed if possible. The forearm is to be bent slightly, and a splint applied,â€”made to fit accurately, and with a joint corresponding to the bend of the arm. This should be occasionally re- moved, provided consolidation of the fractured bones has advanced so far as to admit of it, and slight pas- sive motion of the elbow-joint employed. Obstinate rigidity of the parts is thus guarded against. Fracture of the condyles has been already alluded to. It may be farther observed, that the exact na- ture of the accident is often difficult to detect; in all 5

EXCISION OF DISEASED BONES. 398 tions—in the cancellated articulating extremity of a long bone, in part or the whole of a short bone, and in part or the whole of long bones. Even a long bone, from one articulating surface to the other, may- be removed ; the metacarpal bone of the thumb, and the metatarsal bone supporting the great toe, may, for example, be taken away in their whole extent. I have seen these bones so treated, but the result was unsatisfactory. As has already been observed, the part of the member that is left is without support, and not under the influence of muscle ; it is conse- quently loose and useless. Operation for the removal of necrosed, or softened and ulcerated portions of the carpal and tarsal bones, is sometimes successful. But operative interference, either with these, or with more extensive and for- midable articulations, is not advisable unless the soft parts are not largely involved, and when the general health is tolerably good—the patient either having suffered less than usual, or having rallied and begun to gain strength after exhaustion by discharge and fever. If the ligaments, bursas, and cellular tissue are much affected, as is often the case, there is no chance of discharge ceasing, and the patient regaining health, even though the bone be removed to any extent—a second operation will be required, namely, amputa- tion above the diseased parts. And when this becomes requisite, after failure of the first to restore or even improve the health, the patient is apt, as has too often been the case, to sink under the accumulation of suffering. He might, even though much exhaust-

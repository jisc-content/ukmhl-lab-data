264 rilACTUllE OF THE Sl'lNE. lymphatic effusion—disorganisation and softening of the medullary matter, with urinary symptoms. In- flammation of the membranes, or of the chord itself, may supervene, either very soon after the accident, or long afterwards ; its intensity and period of acces- sion will depend on the extent of the injury, and on the treatment. The muscles act spasmodically, the circulation is excited, the sensorium and nervous sys- tem are disordered, delirium ensues, and is followed by paralysis and coma. In some cases of displacement, even to no small extent, the spinal chord escapes being bruised, torn, or compressed ; no bad symptoms may ensue ; or pa- ralysis to a greater or less degree occurs and gradu- ally goes off, probably occasioned by bloody eff"usion, which is afterwards absorbed. This I have experi- enced in several instances—in a boy who fell over a high rock—in a woman who fell from a window ; both lighted on the breech, and the trunk was bent for- wards. The lad remained stout, but his trunk was somewhat deformed by an excurvation ; the woman recovered perfectly. In these cases there was evi- dently laceration of the interspinal ligaments, though probably not of the ligamenta subflava, for the spinal chord must be stretched or otherwise injured when these are torn. The chord is more or less injured in the majority of cases of fractured spine. If the injury occurs high in the cervical region, immediate death ensues, from compression or laceration of the medulla oblongata. Respiration is arrested by compression or destruction of the chord above the origin of the phrenic and other

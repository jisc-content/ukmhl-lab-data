J.UXATION OF THE HlP-JOlNT. 338 could have been offered by muscular energy ; yet very powerful force was applied and persevered in without avail. At last the external lateral ligament was divided by the point of a very narrow and fine bistoury, and then replacement was immediate and easy. Some inflammation followed, but was kept within bounds, and the man regained the use of the articulation. In other cases, again, the bone is re- placed by the use of but very slight force, provided it be applied, as already stated, in a direction towards the palm of the hand. The last phalanx is equally liable to luxation in the thumb as in the fingers, and has no peculiarity of treatment. Luxation of the Hip-joint.â€”The great strength of the ligaments, the depth and fitness of the bony and cartilaginous cavity for the reception of the head of the bone, and the great power of the muscles sur- rounding the articulation, render dislocation here both difficult and rare. The accident is generally produced by great and sudden force, applied either to the distal end of the femur, or to the farther extre- mity of the limb, as by falling from a considerable height, by the foot slipping whilst the person is sup- porting a heavy weight, by falls from or with a horse, &c. The luxation, in a great majority of cases, takes place upwards and backwards, the head of the bone lying on the dorsum of the ilium. The limb is shortened to the extent of from an inch and a half to two inches and a half, the toes are turned in, the thigh is slightly bent upon the pelvis, and very

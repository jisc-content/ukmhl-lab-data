255 FRACTURES. the limb and of the patient, when long confinement is required, must be considered, and rendered as easy as possible, though at the same time secure. The apparatus for retaining the bones in the right posi- tion must be varied according to circumstances. In compound fractures, when the wound is so small and clean that adhesion readily takes place, the cure is as rapid as in the simplest form of accident; but when the soft parts are much lacerated, the breach in them must be repaired by granulation; there will be profuse discharge from the wound, with risk of deep suppuration, and union of the bones will be slow. To accomplish reduction, long and sharp pieces of bone may require to be removed by means either of the saw or of the forceps, or else the wound must be dilated; both proceedings may be necessary in some cases. Detached portions of bone, and foreign bodies, if any, must be taken away; and the edge of the wound may be approximated when a reasonable chance of adhesion exists. The limb must then be properly placed and secured. Inflammatory action, should it threaten, must be kept down, but bleeding and purging are to be employed with cau- tion. The action and its consequences are moderated by one or two depletions, but these must not be had recourse to without due consideration of circum- stances ; strength is required to effect the action neces- sary for union, and to withstand the subsequent suppurations, though these may be prevented or at least moderated by timeous depletion. Abscesses are to be opened early, the parts are fomented, and then perhaps poulticed. The limb must all along

HYDROCELE. 159 but still if the inguinal glands appear sound, and the chord tolerably free, castration is to be performed as the last, though desperate, means of eradicating the disease. By Hydrocele is meant a tumour caused by accu- mulation of fluid either in the chord or within the cavity of the tunica vaginalis testis. It has been divided into diffused and encysted. By the former term is understood effusion and accumulation of serum in the cellular tissue, the cells gradually dila- ting to accommodate the increasing fluid, and ulti- mately becoming converted into vesicles of large size ; the parts around are thickened and condensed. This affection is very rarely a local one, but almost uniformly combined with and forming a part of anasarca arising from constitutional causes. When the swelling proves troublesome, it may be diminish- ed by drawing off the fluid through one or several punctures ; free incision is attended with risk, and is besides unnecessary.

\ 200 CALCULUS VESICAE. five ounces; on the seventeenth, about a pound. The bleeding was uniformly preceded by a feverish attack; and the blood had a florid, arterial appear- ance, and flowed rapidly. It proceeded from the inte- rior of the wound, and a suppurating cavity in the neighbourhood of the prostate was felt by the finger. From the prostatic side of this abscess the blood ap- peared to spring; probably a considerable branch of the pudic ramifying in this situation had been opened i by unhealthy ulceration. Pressure proved always effectual at the time, the haemorrhage recurring on * the loosening and separation of the lint. After the last bleeding the dressing was retained for some days, and on its removal no recurrence took place. The patient had been much exhausted by this severe loss of blood, but notwithstanding made a good, and by no means tedious, recovery. Many patients have perished within the first day or two from bleeding, owing to the using of the knife too freely and in an improper direction. By very slight application of the edge to the resisting fibres, and by gentle dilatation with the finger, the mem- branous portion of the urethra is reached. The knife is passed over the back of the forefinger in the wound, and lodged in the groove of the staff'; it is then carried forwards through the prostate, with the edge directed downwards and outwards, cutting the gland obliquely. In this incision the knife is raised very little from the groove, the object being to divide the gland to the extent of no more than barely three quarters of an inch. By so doing, the reflection of the pelvic fascia remains uninjured, and the boundary

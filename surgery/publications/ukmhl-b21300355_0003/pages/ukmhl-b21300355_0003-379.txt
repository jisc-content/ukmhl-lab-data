AMPUTATION. 367 been long* known as effectual in arresting bleeding. Vessels of a larg-e size can be so treated with suf- ficient facility, and they may not bleed after; but well tied ones are much more secure. The smaller cannot be pulled out and twisted, ligatures must be used for them; and the application of one or two more ligatures, namely, to the large arteries as well as the small, will add to the patient's safety, and to the operator's comfort and peace of mind, and can have little effect in increasing irritation. I have made trial of the method of torsion after amputation, and for the above reasons, and because the manipula- tions are more tedious, I disapprove of the plan, and decidedly prefer the ligatures. I am not aware that the proposal of leaving the vessels both untwisted and without ligature has been tried in this country ; one would think that it must always be troublesome, and not unfrequently hazardous. In some cases, as when the incisions are made in the neighbourhood of diseased bone, the soft parts are so condensed that the vessels cannot be pulled out by means of the forceps ; they are to be trans- fixed by a sharp hook or tenaculum, and a ligature is then applied round the parts which the instrument holds ; or the vessels may be encircled by a thread passed round by means of a curved needle ; in both methods more or less of the surrounding tissues must necessarily be included in the noose, though always as little as possible. Sometimes an artery of the bone, whether sound or inflamed, bleeds sharply ; in such circumstances the application of ligature is difficult, 6

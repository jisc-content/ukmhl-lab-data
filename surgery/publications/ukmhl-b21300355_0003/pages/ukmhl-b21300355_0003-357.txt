LUXATION OF THE KNEE. 345 interior to the head of the bone, and are compressed, and the crural nerves are stretched over it. In attempting reduction, rotation inwards should be employed during extension, accompanied with endea- vours to lift the upper part of the bone towards the acetabulum. Luxation of the Bones of the Leg—separation of them from the end of the femur—seldom occurs. It can be the effect only of great violence and great laceration. Most frequently fracture is concomitant, perhaps with wound ; and such accidents require amputation, either primarily or secondarily. Subluxa- tion, from laceration of the internal lateral ligament, is not so unfrequent. It is most common in females, the natural conformation of their thigh-bones being to bend inwards ; and from falling awkwardly, par- ticularly if carrying a weight, the ligament is apt to give way. The limb is pained, deformed, and unable to support the body, and swelling to a considerable extent soon follows. Reduction is extremely easy ; and the parts are retained in site by the application of a wooden splint, to either the outer or the posterior side of the joint, the leg and foot being previously bandaged. The joint remains long weak, and never recovers entirely; a sustaining apparatus, fitted on the outside, retained by straps, and with a joint oppo- site to the articulation, is required to be constantly worn when the patient wishes to use the limb. Luxation of the Patella is spoken of by some as common. Others of much experience have not met

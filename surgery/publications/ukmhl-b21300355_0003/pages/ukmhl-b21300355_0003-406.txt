AMPUTATION OF THE THIGH. 394 apply to this operation as to that immediately below the knee. In amputation of the thigh, the same method of incision is followed as in amputation of the arm. But, according to the point of removal, the direction of the flaps varies. If in operating high in the limb the flaps be made laterally, there will be imminent risk of the bone protruding through the upper part of the wound ; for the patient uniformly raises the stump towards his abdomen. No antagonist muscular power is left to oppose the action of the muscles inserted into the trochanter minor, and the elevation of the stump is involuntary; it always occurs to a remarkable extent in young persons. On this account, anterior and posterior flaps are here far preferable to the late- ral ; for then the more the stump is raised, the better is the end of the bone coveredâ€”the anterior flap folds over it. Transfixion is therefore made horizontally ; and the posterior flap should be a little longer than the anterior. But in the lower part of the limb, late- ral flaps are not only not liable to the same objection, but preferable to the anterior and posterior. In the neighbourhood of the knee-joint, the soft pai'ts con- sist almost entirely of ligamentous tissue on the fore and .back part, and proper cushions can be obtained only from the sides. Transfixion is therefore made perpendicularly. Thus the bone will be well covered by parts likely soon to adhere; and there is no risk of protrusion, for muscles are left to comiteract the elevators, and there is sufficient lever in the limb whereby to control its motions. And it may be here

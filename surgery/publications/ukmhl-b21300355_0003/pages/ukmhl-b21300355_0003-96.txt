In the greater number of cases, a second inter- position of dressing is all that is required. In all cases, dressing should not be continued long ; but as the cavity gradually contracts, discharging laudable pus, and becoming coated with healthy florid granulations, the interposed pledgets should be daily diminished, and soon omitted entirely. If the surgeon continue long to stuff the wound it cannot contract, will become callous as before, and a fistula will be reproduced. Injections into the wound, or the application of lint soaked in a gently stimulating lotion, are often bene- ficial in promoting contraction. But, as already stated, most fistulse get well after proper incision, with but one dressing, and without any after applica- tion excepting plenty of soap and water. During the cure, the general health must be kept vigorous, and the state of the bowels strictly attended to. j In ulcer of the mucous lining, with irritability of action in the bowel, injections of tepid or cold water are useful, by removing irritating matters from the part. By means of a speculum ani the ulcer can be readily exposed; it may be touched occasionally with the nitrate of silver, in substance or solution, or, if indolent, with a solution of the muriate of mercury.

STlllCTUllE OF THE UllETHllA. 119 When the nistrument has been fairly lodged in the bladder, it is to be retained. A tape is attach- ed to each of the rings at the neck of the catheter^ is brought under the thigh, and fastened to a band- age passed round the waist; this simple retentive apparatus is quite effectual, and suits the erect as well as the recumbent posture. A peg, of metal or wood, is placed in the mouth of the catheter, that the patient may be kept dry, and at the same time have it in his power to relieve the bladder as often as necessary. The instrument should be retained for twenty-four hours at least, and, if the patient can bear it, for forty-eight, or even more. At first it oc- casions considerable uneasiness, pain, and excitement, but these gradually subside ; when severe, they may be allayed by opiates. The parts make efforts to get rid of the foreign body, and these efforts are salu- tary. Discharge takes place from the membrane, and oozes by the side of the catheter; relaxation occurs, often to a very great extent; and, on moving the handle of the instrument, it is found to be not only less firmly grasped, but to possess considerable free- dom of motion in the contracted part.

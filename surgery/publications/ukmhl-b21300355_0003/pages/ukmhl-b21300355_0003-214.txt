Indeed, the neck of the bladder is capable of dilatation without any incision. In a case of perineal abscess containing a portion of exfoliated bone, on account of which incision was made, it was found that the cavity communicated with the urethra ; lest other foreign matter should remain, I introduced my finger into this aperture in the membranous portion, and found that by the most gentle movement I could not only easily reach the bladder, but dilate the open- ing in it to a very considerable extent. By the finger'in the bladder the size and position of the stone is ascertained ; and no extracting instru- ment should be employed till after the finger is in con- tact with the stone. When it is of moderate size, and after having been turned, if necessary, into the most favourable position for extraction, the forceps are introduced. This instrument should be tolerably long, so as to afford power in its use; and the extremities of its blades should be covered with cloth, for thus it is not so likely to slip or to chip the stone as those with raised and projecting teeth. For flat stones, the forceps should be flat-mouthed ; for round, more open, hollowed, and bent; or for the latter description of stone, forceps with a sliding joint may be used. The object is to lay hold of the concretion by as many points as possibleâ€”to bring a large surface in contact with the instrument. Those with the sliding joint are of no service when the stone is flat, as it either cannot be caught by them at all, or merely by their points, or near tlie joint; it is applicable only to

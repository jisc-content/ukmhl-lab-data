122 RETENTION OF UKINE. sion of their secretion is a very suspicious and dan- gerous occurrence. In the healthy state of the urinary organs, when the powers of each correspond, the urine passes without almost any exertion on the part of the pa- tient; the action of the levator ani and abdominal muscles is scarcely required. But when either struc- ture or function is disordered, the balance between the parts is upset; additional assistance is necessary for expulsion of the contents of the bladder. The symptoms of retention differ according to the state of the parts and the cause which has induced it. The bladder varies in size, and in distensibility. In some cases the organ yields readily to the accumu- lation of fluid within it, rising high in the belly, reaching even the umbilicus, and forming a large, oval, tense, fluctuating swelling, apparent to the most careless and casual observer. The swelling and fluc- tuation are in such circumstances so distinct, that the disease has actually been mistaken for ascites. Again, all the symptoms of retention may exist, and all its bad consequences result, without any apparent swell- ing of the abdomen. But then the distended bladder can always be felt by the finger introduced into the va- gina or rectum ; indeed its posterior fundus bulges in towards the cavity of the gut, in every case, before it ascends upwards in the abdomen. Sickening and agonizing pain, with great anxiety and ineffectual straining, generally attend distension of the blad- der to any great degree. ^Vhen the distension is allowed to continue, urinous fever supervenes, the

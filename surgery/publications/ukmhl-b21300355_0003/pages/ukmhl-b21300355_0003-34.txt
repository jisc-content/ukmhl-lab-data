OF HERNIA. 22 ness of the opening giving rise to engorgement of the protruded parts. 7. By accumulation of foeces, solid or fluid, in the protruded portion of bowel. With care, some of these causes may be got over, and the tumour reduced. In irreducible hernia the use of a bag truss is indispensable to prevent increase of the protrusion. In irreducible femoral hernia of small size, a hollow pad with a weak spring is used with advantage, to give support to the contained parts, prevent farther protrusion, and guard the tumour against external violence. The patient must avoid violent exertion, keep his bowels open, and be careful of his diet; he is always in danger, and should know it. Many have lost their lives from blows otherwise not dangerous ; and even straining at stool is suffi- cient to force additional portions of viscera into the neck of the sac, and thereby induce most serious distress. The term incarceration of hernia is employed to indicate a slight degree of Strang illation, when the hernial contents are confined from any cause, and when the circulation in the protruded bowel and the course of the foeculent matter are nevertheless unin- terrupted. By many it is applied indiscriminately with strangulation. Strangulation arises, not from any change in the neck of the sac or in the tendinous aperture, but from increase of volume in the protruded parts, caused by accumulation of the solid, fluid, or gaseous contents of the bowel, followed by interruption to its circula- tion ; or the interruption to the flow of blood may

Amputation at the hip-joint is deservedly ranked amongst the most formidable operations in surgery. It ought, therefore, never to be performed but as a last and necessitous resource for the salvation of life. At the same time, when necessity for it is obvious and acknowledged, and no other means can be of any avail, hesitation and delay should never take place ; otherwise the last and only chance of saving the patient will pass away, and the operation, when at length performed, will but hasten his exit from this world,—and besides inflict an injury to science, by in- timidating practitioners, and affording subject of re- proach and ridicule to the thoughtless and uninform- ed part of the public. I prefer the formation of ante- rior and posterior flaps,—as follows. The patient is placed recumbent on a firm table, his nates resting on, or rather projecting a little over the front edge.

Or it is secured to the foot of the table by a towel, the neces- sity for an additional assistant being thus done away with, and more freedom in his movements afforded to the operator. Indeed, in all amputations of the lower extremity, this is the preferable method of fix-

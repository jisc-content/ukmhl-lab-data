AMPUTATION OF THE ARM. 382 down, and attached by suture to the integument posteriorly; in due time the adhesive dressing is ap- plied. The circumstance of a secreting surface form- ing the stump does not seem detrimental, either here, or in the wrist-joint. The synovial fluid soon ceases to distil, and union is not interrupted by it. There is no necessity for scarification, with the view of hastening cessation of secretion and granulation of the surface. Amputation of the arm is performed by the forma- tion of lateral flaps, at any point below the insertion of the deltoid muscle. Compression is made on the upper part of the humeral, or on the axillary artery. The limb is held well separated from the side ; and care should be taken that, when so raised, its height be convenient to the operator. The knife is entered perpendicularly to the shaft of the bone, passed fair- ly down to it, and then inclined along its side; the operator now grasps the limb below the line of incision with the left hand, and pulls the muscles towards him—it is supposed that the right arm is amputa- ted, the surgeon standing on the inside, and an as- sistant supporting the forearm—and then completes transfixion, inclining the handle of the knife towards himself, in order that its point may pass round the bone and emerge at as distant a point in the cir- cumference of the limb as possible. By a rapid saw- ing motion, downwards and inwards to the proper extent, the inner flap is formed ; and by attention to the grasping of the muscles and the inclination of the

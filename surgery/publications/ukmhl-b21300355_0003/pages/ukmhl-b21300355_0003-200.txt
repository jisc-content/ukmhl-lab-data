CALCULUS VESlCiE. 188 blades shut by being withdrawn into a cunula, and made either straight or curved; but they are not so applicable as the forceps of Weiss. These are of differ- ent curves and sizes, and the handles should be made of iron, smooth on the flat surfaces and roughened on the edges ; for thus the concretion will be more readily felt. The instrument is passed along the urethra, and used in the bladder as a sound ; when it has touched the stone the blades are opened, and by raising the handle, pressing the convex part down- M'ards, and then allowing the blades to close slowly, the concretion is embraced. If the stone lie on the forepart of the instrument, on its concavity, it will fall between the blades as soon as they are sufficiently separated. By observing whether or not the wire goes home into the canula, it is ascertained whether or not the foreign body is between the blades ; if it is not, the manoeuvring must be repeated ; if it is, the instrument is to be withdrawn carefullyâ€”of course bringing the concretion along with it. Some slight resistance is felt in passing the prostate, as also anterior to the sinus; and on reaching the orifice, some little force is requisite to complete the removal, or the orifice maybe dilated by a slight incision so as to facilitate the disentanglement of the forceps with the concretion. By one or more operations of this nature many stones may be removed, and the pa- tient thus freed entirely from the disease. There is no great risk of seizing and pinching the coats of the bladder with this instrument, whilst there is a toler- able certainty of doing so with most of the othei-s.

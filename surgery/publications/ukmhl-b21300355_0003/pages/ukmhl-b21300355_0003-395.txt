383 AMPUTATION OV TUK ARM. knife, its base is so large as to admit of the more easy performance of accurate transfixion for the outerâ€” that is, the instrument is more easily brought through the same incision. The assistant seizes the extremi- ty of the inner flap as soon as formed, and retracts it, but only to a slight extent; it is simply held out of the way. If it be pulled backwards as in re- traction during sawing, the formation of the second will be much impeded. The knife is again entered about half an inch below the commencement of the first incision, and by inclining the handle the point is brought round the bone, and made to appear on the opposite side also in the first incision ; this is facilitated by pulling the soft parts outwards with the left hand. Then the outer flap is completed. The knife is swept rapidly round the bone, so as to expose it completely at the upper part, the assistant at the same time retracting the flaps fully. The saw is applied, the arteries tied, the flaps approximated, and the operation completed. In performing the second transfixion, the reason why the knife is entered lower than in the first, is, that cross-cutting of the corners of the wound is thereby avoided. For long I was surprised and an- noyed to find many stumps present an unseemly cross-cutting of the integument at the upper parts, particularly after approximation of the flaps, al- though the incisions seemed to have been made smoothly and accurately. It is occasioned by the sawing process for making the second flap, and when this is commenced at the same height as for the first, irregularity of incision at the upper part is unavoid-

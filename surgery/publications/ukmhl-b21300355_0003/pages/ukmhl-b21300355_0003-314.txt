FRACTURE OF THE PATELLA. 302 fourteen years of age, in consequence of the limb ha- ving- been entangled amongst the spokes of a carriage- wheel in motion; the knee continued painful and swoln, and she had a halt in walking. After the lapse of about three years, extensive suppuration occurred in the lower part of the thigh and round the knee-joint, and amputation very soon became in- dispensable for the preservation of life. The syno- vial apparatus was much diseased, and the epiphysis of the lower end of the femur was found displaced forwards and upwards, so that only the posterior part rested on the tibia ; in fact, it was turned almost half round on the shaft: firm union by bone had taken place. Fracture of the Patella is generally simple. It is occasioned either by great force applied to the bone directly, or by the action of the strong extensor musclesâ€”the knee being suddenly bent, and the bone snapped across over the end of the femur. The degree of immediate swelling, and of incited action, will vary according to the mode of infliction. When the injury is caused by a blow upon the part, the bone may be broken either transversely or vertically, or both ; either the upper or the lower portion may be vertically split, usually the upper; sometimes there is considerable comminution. Muscular action produces transverse fracture only. The nature and extent of the injury is readily ascertained. The patient is unable to extend the limb, and cannot support weight on it; in tiie bent

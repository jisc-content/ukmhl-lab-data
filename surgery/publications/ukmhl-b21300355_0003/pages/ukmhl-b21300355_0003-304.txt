FRACTURE OF THE FEMUR. 292 rotation; but retraction of the thigh would after a time inevitably occur, and has done so when the nature of the injury was not at first ascertained, nor proper treatment adopted. Most frequently there is eversion of the toes, and to a considerable extent; sometimes there is inversion, and this is owing to the limb either having been placed in that position in falling, or having acquired it after the injury has been inflicted. The rotators outward are the more powerful; the limb naturally inclines outwards, and when in the recumbent posture, the weight of the foot favours eversion. But in fracture the muscles do not act as in a sound limb ; and when the limb is once placed, the patient will not by his own efforts alter the posi- tion. Thus it is that inversion not unfrequently happens in this form of fracture, although the oppo- site state is that which, from a consideration of the muscles involved, is a priori to be expected. In in- version the limb presents somewhat of the appearance arising from the most common luxation ; but it pos- sesses greater mobility, and has not the want of pro- minence occasioned by displacement of the articulating extremity of the bone. The facility of lengthening the member, and the crepitation felt on a proper and more attentive manipulation, will remove all doubt. On examining the injured hip, motion to any ex- tent can be effected, though with excruciating suf- fering to the patient. On stretching the limb to its original length, and then rotating slightly, crepitation can be felt by the hand, or heard by the ear, placed over the trochanter major.

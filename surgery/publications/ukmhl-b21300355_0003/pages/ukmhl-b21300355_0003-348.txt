336 LUXATION or THE I'lNOEllS. the joint. The accident, however, is rare. I have never seen simple dislocation of any of the metacar- pal bones. Dislocation of the Fingers is produced by force ap- plied to the extremities of the phalanges ; the dis- placement is always backwards, excepting at the middle joint, where the bone of the middle phalanx is sometimes, but very rarely, luxated forwards. The remarkable projection on the back part of the finger marks the nature of the accident, even to the most careless observer. Reduction is accomplished by ex- tension combined with flexion. In the case of the distal phalanges, it may sometimes be necessary to fasten a handkerchief to the tip of the finger, in order to obtain sufficient extending power. After replace- ment, the application of temporary splints and ban- dage is prudent. Compound luxations, however care- fully treated, almost uniformly come to amputation. Luxation of the first joint of the thumb is rather an uncommon accident, and is not easily managed. The base of the first phalanx is displaced backwards upon the distal extremity of the metacarpal bone, causing a remarkable prominence on the dorsal as- pect, and a corresponding depression on the palmar. The thumb is shortened, deformed, and almost im- movable ; the sweUing and pain are severe. This displacement is generally produced by the application of force to the point of the thumb, as in falling on it, or in coming against a resisting body with the thumb straight. The deformity is such as at once to ap- prise even the most inattentive or inexperienced of

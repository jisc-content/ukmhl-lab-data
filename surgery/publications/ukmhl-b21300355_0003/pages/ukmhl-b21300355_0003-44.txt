OF HERNIA. 32 the time without pulsation, from whom no blood flowed after the incisions, and who never rallied, but sunk rapidly. Indeed the patient is always in a very unfavourable state for operation after the exhibition of the tobacco enema, though certainly in a very fa- vourable state for reduction being attempted. The strong objection to the medicine, I conceive to be its being so extremely unmanageable; it is impossible to say whether the depression of the vital powers ^hat must ensue will be just sufficient to induce that relaxation and debility necessary or favourable to reduction, or whether it will proceed uncontrollable to such a degree as to extinguish life.

Were I so unfor- tunate as to be the subject of strangulated hernia, I should certainly have no tobacco used. After unsuc- cessful trial of the taxis, I might submit to be bled ad deliquium, and have a surgeon to attempt reduction during syncope ; if somewhat more advanced in life I should prefer the warm bath ; if this failed, I should certainly be operated on in a very few minutes after- wards.

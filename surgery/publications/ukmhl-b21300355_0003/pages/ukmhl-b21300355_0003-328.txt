DISLOCATIONS. 316 attended with violent pain ; the patient is sick and pale ; the system receives a shock, from which it gradually recovers after some time. Then swelling, from effused blood, takes place ; and this is followed, after some hours, by excited action of the vessels and farther effusion, giving rise to greater stiffness and pain on attempts at motion. If no means are taken to replace the bone, the painful feelings subside along with the swelling, the limb remains long useless, and is the seat of occasional lancinating pains, but at last motion and utility are to a certain extent restored by the formation of a new joint—the head of the bone, and the parts on which it rests, mutually accom- modating themselves to each other, by degrees, and permitting a limited extent of motion. Post mortem examination, years after the occm'rence of the injury, shows change in the form of the bones—the head is flattened, and in the bone on which it lies there is a corresponding depression, formed partly by the depo- sition of new matter, partly by absorption of the old ; in dislocation on the dorsum of the ilium for exam- ple, there is excavation by absorption opposite to the centre of the head of the femur, and round this new osseous matter is deposited so as to form the cavity into a cup resembling the acetabulum. New jjrocesses are formed for the attachment of the muscles, and the old are absorbed to a remarkable extent. There are also new ligaments ; and a sort of capsule is formed by condensation of the surrounding cellular tissue. The new articulating surface becomes quite smooth inter- nally, and is covered, if not by cartilage, by a sub-

355 SPRAIN. of the tendon of the gastrocnemii, which had been in powerful action—probably, the tendinous and mus- cular tissues have been separated to a slight extent. Occasionally the tendo Achillis is found .completely torn through, and its upper end retracted ; in such cases a large space is occasioned at the injured part, when the knee is extended and the foot bent. Some- times the tendo Achillis is cut through ; I have seen both completely divided in the same individual—he received a sabre wound across the back of both limbs, while endeavouring to escape from the mate of a vessel, in which he had been stealing. In rupture without breach of surface, the torn bloodvessels pour out their contents into the cellular tissue to a consi- derable extent, and if a proper mode of cure be not adopted immediately, inflammation quickly super- venes ; and this is apt to terminate very unfavour- ably in the infiltrated tissue. The tendon is united by the deposition of new matter, and the conversion of this into substance resembling the original structure from the vessels of which the deposit has taken place. The quantity of new formation necessarily depends on the extent of laceration and the space thereby occasioned. That such reparation of tendon does take place, and that to a very great extent occasionally, is placed beyond all doubt by the results of veterinary practice. " Knuckling oyer" in horses is occasioned by con- traction of the flexor tendon ; the heel does not reach the ground, and in order to effect this the tendon is completely divided. The cut ends immediately sepa- rate, to the extent of some inches, and after a time

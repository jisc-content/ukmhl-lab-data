210 CALCULUS VESICA. in young people, and later in those far advanced in lifeâ€”the urine begins to flow in part by the natural passage, causing considerable pain in consequence of the urethra having been for a time unaccustomed to its stimulus ; and as the opening in the prostate con- tracts, the escape of urine by the wound proportion- ally diminishes. When the natural course is com- pletely restored, the wound closes more rapidly than before, granulations soon fill it up, and cicatrisation takes place. Sometimes, though very rarely, a small fistulous opening remains for some time, through which a few drops of urine may occasionally distil; should it prove obstinate in not closing, it may be touched with a heated wire. And sometimes also, when the urine is unusually slow of coming by the urethra, this may be expedited by the occasional in- troduction of a catheter or bougie. It is not often that the operation of lithotomy re- quires to be repeated. In some few cases, however, the calculous diathesis continues, a new concretion is formed, and the patient again applies for relief, per- haps several years afterwards. In such circumstan- ces, the incisions are to be made in the right side of the perineum ; for the track of the former wound is now consolidated, firm, and hard, and would be cut with diflSculty. But when, from neglect or want of dexterity, the first operation has been imperfectly performed, one or more stones being left behind, the wound may not heal, nor even contract to any considerable extent ; and then dilatation of the ex- isting opening, with fresh section of the prostate.

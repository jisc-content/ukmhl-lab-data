rilACTURE OF THE LOWER JAW. 261 ing to the severity of injury clone to the soft parts, and the time which has elapsed before reduction. The parts within the mouth swell; often there is great infiltration of the loose cellular tissue under the tongue. Sometimes extensive abscess forms, show- ing itself in the mouth or under the chin. The bone is to be brought to its former shape by pressure of the fingers on the outside, and of the thumbs placed within the mouth on the corners of the teeth. Motion is prevented, and the parts are retained in their proper situation, by a wedge of cork or wood interposed on each side of the jaw, and grooved so as to receive the teeth both above and below. The wedges are placed with their thick ends anteriorly, and are retained by the lower jaw being firmly bound towards the upper ; sufficient space for the introduction of food must be left between the wedges at the fore-part of the mouth. Pasteboard is applied externally, cut so as to fit exactly the frac- tured bone ; it is previously softened in warm water, that it may adapt itself to the shape of the parts, and form a case over them ; a thin layer of carded tow is placed between it and the skin, and the whole is retained by a roller, which is preferable to split cloths. The patient should not talk, or in any way attempt motion of the injured bone, and the food given should not require mastication. Inflammation is to be kept down by the usual means, and abscesses, if they form, must be early evacuated. Detached teeth and splin- ters of the jaw are to be extracted at the first; if teeth loosen during the cure, they should be con- sidered as foreign bodies and removed, otherwise

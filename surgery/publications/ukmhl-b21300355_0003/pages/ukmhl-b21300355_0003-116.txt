104 INFLAMMATION Ol' THE BLADDER. blood was extensively effused into the bladder, and attempted to extract the suspected extravasation by- means of an exhausting syringe through a catheter, probably not passed into the bladder. Occasionally, though rarely, the inflammation extends to the peritoneal covering of the bladder, and thence to the external surface of the intestines. The bladder becomes thickened, and lymph is ef- fused between its coats, from repeated attacks of in- flammation, or from long continued irritation in con- sequence of resistance to the expulsion of its contents. The mucous membrane is thickened, relaxed, and of a flocculent appearance ; the fibres of the muscular coat are enlarged, and, bulging out, form projections along their course; the mucous follicles are expanded ; and depressions, often of large size, are formed be- tween the projections of the enlarged muscular fasci- culi. The cavity of the organ is generally dimi- nished in proportion to the thickening of its parietes, and there is a loss of balance betwixt the retaining and expelling powers. Irritable bladder is generally a symptom of some other affection. There is profuse mucous discharge ; micturition ; pain, increased by distention of the organ, and relieved by evacuation. The coats are more vascular than naturally ; sometimes the mus- cular is strengthened, and ulceration of the mucous membrane is not infrequent. Occasionally this lat- ter tunic is the seat of tumour. In the treatment of inflammation of the bladder, after removal of its causes, antiphlogistic means

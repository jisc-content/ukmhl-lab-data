306 FRACTUltE OF THE LEG. Fracture of one bone, at a point lower in the limb, is not attended with much displacement or deformity. Indeed, attentive manipulation is often required to detect the site of the injury; and a sense of crepita- tion is perceived, only when the lower and upper por- tions of the bone are pressed on alternately or during rotation of the foot. When both bones are broken, the disjilacement and swelling are great. The foot is sometimes turned inwards, but usually it falls out- wards ; and if there has been much laceration of the soft parts, with or without division of the integu- ments, the lower portion of the limb hangs quite loose. By the application of great force, as by a rope being twisted round and run tight on the limb, both bones and soft parts may be reduced almost to a pulp, with- out much or any division of the integument. Such an accident is, followed by rapid and great swelling, violent incited action, gangrene, and severe constitu- tional disturbance. The progress of the mortifica- tion is not in all cases uniform ; in some, the swelling and discoloration extend to the groin and trunk in two or three days, attended with furious delirium ; in others, the disorganisation of the limb is very slow, some days elapsing before it reaches the knee, and in these the constitutional symptoms are less severe. In some cases there is extensive wound of tlie in- tegiiments, without serious injury of the bone, mus- cles, or vessels. The skin either has been divided by the external force acting upon the resisting bone,

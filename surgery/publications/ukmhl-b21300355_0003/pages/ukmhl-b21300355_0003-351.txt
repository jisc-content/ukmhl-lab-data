339 LUXATION OF THE HIP-JOINT. firmly fixed. Before swelling has occurred, and also after it has subsided, the head of the bone can be felt lying under the gluteus. The trochanter is evidently out of place, being depressed, and lying farther up and back than usual. This is strikingly observable on comparing the injured limb with the opposite. Attempts to move the limb and effect rotation pro- duce great pain. Large swelling soon follows, along with greater stiffness and immobility. If the head of the bone is not replaced, the pain gradually subsides, and, after some months, freedom of motion is regain- ed to a slight extent; the patient is able to walk, but with a great halt. At first, reduction is accomplished with no great difficulty. Within a very short time after the oc- currence of the injury, before the patient had re- covered from the shock, whilst he still lay sick, faint, and powerless, I have succeeded in effecting reduc- tion of the femur quite unassisted,—extending with one hand, grasping the thigh behind, and, at the same time, rotating it outwards by pressure of the forearm on the leg, counter-extension being made by the left hand on the symphysis pubis. When a few hours have intervened, assistance and apparatus are requi- site. The patient is secured by a broad band,—a common sheet suits very well,—passed under the perineum. The laque is fixed above the knee, with a knot that will not run, a towel wrung out of cold water being applied next to the skin, in order to in- crease the security of the hold and prevent excoria- tion.

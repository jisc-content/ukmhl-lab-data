AFFECTIONS OF THE CHEST. 6 come thin, and even to give way, without the nature of the case being known ; but this can be the result only of ignorance or of inattention. In such cases the ribs have been denuded, and become necrosed to a large extent,—the sequestra separating slowly and in fragments, and causing long continued and wasting discharge. It is plain, therefore, that point- ing of the matter should never be waited for. Chronic collections are occasionally met with, of years duration, and producing great enlargement of the chest. Surgical interference with such is less likely to prove beneficial than with the acute. Wlunds of the large blood-vessels of the chest, or of the cavities of the heart, are almost immediately fatal. Mere punctures, however, of these parts, have closed for a time, and in some cases even permanently. All wounds of the chest, though not involving blood- vessels of a large size, are productive of severe con- sequences—effusion of blood or bloody fluids into the cavities, escape of air into the external cellular tissue, collapse of the lung; and inflammation and its results are always to be dreaded. The danger is not uniformly tantamount to the extent of injury inflict- ed. Individuals have recovered from extensive wounds causing profuse haemorrhage, and great dis- placement and laceration of the parts ; whilst, from much slighter injuries, untoward and fatal conse- quences have quickly resulted. "Wounds may pene- trate the chest, and be continued into the abdomen ; the stomach, liver, and intestines—one or all—may

IIETENTION OF URINE. 127 has been already adverted to, but it is necessary to bear in mind the thickening of the latter, and the dilatation which uniformly takes place behind the stricture. All the urgent symptoms of retention may, in this case, arise from the accumulation of but a few ounces of urine. The bladder contracts fre- quently and very forcibly, causing great suffering. Temporary relief is experienced when the urethra gives way by ulceration, and the urine becomes extra- vasated into the cellular texture ; the patient gets up, and, if in the dark, thinks that the stricture has yielded, and that he is passing urine naturally. But soon he feels a glowing heat in the perineum, the parts swell and become livid ; violent constitutional symptoms come on, the discoloration advances, the integuments slough, ill formed matter is discharged, and disorganised cellular tissue mixed with putrid sanies is exposed. The parts exhale a urinous odour, which, when once ifelt by the practitioner, can never afterwards be mistaken. Occasionally cedematous swelling of the penis takes place, particularly of the prepvice, when it has been pulled at and bruised du- ring the patient's efforts to make water, and this must not be confounded with infiltration of urine ; I have seen it occur some time after the bladder had been relieved by the catheter. Retention from the lodgement of calculi. Tempo- rary obstruction to the flow of urine is sometimes experienced from calculus in the bladder. Complete and fatal retention has arisen from calculi having become impacted into the urethra, and been allowed to remain there, blocking up the passage entirely.

A common roller is applied round the limb, from the toes to near the knee, so as to pre- vent infiltration, which would otherwise follow pres- sure above by the rest of the apparatus. The splint is then attached to the limb by involving both in a roller from the foot to above the knee ; and in doing this, the bandage, after having been turned round the ankle, should be passed through the notches, so as to be firmly attached to the end of the splint, thereby preventing the foot from shifting. A broad bandage is applied round the pelvis over the groin, and down the thigh, investing all that part of the limb left uncovered by the previous bandaging.

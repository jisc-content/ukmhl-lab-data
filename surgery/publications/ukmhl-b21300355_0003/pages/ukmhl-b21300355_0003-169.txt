IMPEUFECTIONS OF URETHRA. 157 ciency may be repaired in some measure, when there is abundance of skin to spare, but no rules can be laid down for such irregular operations. Imperfection of the urethra anteriorly, on the dor- sum, is rare—Hyijerspadias. The following is rather a remarkable instance—The man was aged 26, robust and healthy. The whole extent of the urethra ante- rior to the pubes was exposed superiorly, there being a wide fissure through the corpora cavernosa and glans. The penis was retracted considerably, so that the posterior part of the fissure lay beneath the sym- physis pubis. The numerous lacunae of the urethra were beautifully distinct, and the mucous membrane was seen covered by their secretion. When the patient made water, the urine, after emerging from beneath the pubes, divided into numerous small streams, some of which spread over the side of the penis, while others passed along the exposed urethra. The callous margins of the fissure, formed by the corpora caver- nosa and glans, were carefully pared, and, a catheter having been introduced, the raw surfaces were retained in apposition by suture. The wound healed perfectly, almost entirely by the first intention ; and the organ both looked well and proved efficient. The malfor- mation was congenital, and was considered by the patient as analogous to harelip ; but the story re- lated to account for this was not very plausible. The disease of the external parts of the male geni- tal organs, commonly called Chimneij-siveejoer's Cmi- ce?', is one of a formidable and intractable nature, but

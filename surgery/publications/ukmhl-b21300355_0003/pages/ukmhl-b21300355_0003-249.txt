LIGATURE OF FEMORAI-. 237 its middle, or at its upper part, according to the size and situation of the aneurism. Popliteal aneurism is of more frequent occurrence than any of the preceding, and in regard to it also the old operation has deservedly fallen into disuse. It seems in most cases to be occasioned by partial lacera- tion of the coats of the vessel; a sudden pain, and a feeling as of the receipt of an injury on the part, are felt, during some violent or unusual exertion; the pain continues, and an unwonted beating is soon perceived in the ham, along with inconsiderable swelling ; the tumour with pulsation increases, and may ultimately attain a large size, causing pain, general uneasiness in the limb, and lameness, sometimes oedema. In cases of long duration, and when the patient is cach- ectic, the bones become diseased, absorption being caused by the pressure of the tumour, and deep and extensive abscess may form in the soft parts. The superficial femoral is to be tied, and the pre- ferable point is where it is crossed by the sartorius muscle. This is a better practice than removal of the limb, which has not unfrequently been resorted to in cases of large aneurism ; there is great risk in such a proceeding, the anastomosing vessels in the thigh are all much enlarged, profuse haemorrhage takes place during the incisions, not completely arrest- ed by any pressure, and probably twenty arteries or more require ligature, as I have witnessed ; after all, the occurrence of secondary bleeding is not unlikely. I have tied the femoral artery, with a favourable re-

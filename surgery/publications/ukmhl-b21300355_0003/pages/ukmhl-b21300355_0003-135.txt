123 IIETENTION OF URINE. circulation is accelerated, the patient perspires pro- fusely, and exhales a urinous odour; delirium comes on, followed by sinking, and, if the cause is not removed, coma terminates the distressing train of symptoms. In other instances, the painful feel- ings subside after some time, and the urine is dis- charged involuntarily from the urethra. The ureters lose the valvular structure of their vesical termina- tions, and become dilated; the pelvis and infundi- bula of the kidneys also enlarge, and all are distended by the accumulating urine. On relieving the blad- der artificially, the pressure is taken otF the kidneys, their secretion is generally renewed with great vigour, and the bladder is again filled rapidly. If the blad- der is not relieved, the secretion of urine is sup- pressed. In many cases the urethra—the bladder more rarely—sloughs or ulcerates, unless preventive mea- sures are adopted, and extravasation of urine takes place into the cellular tissue of the pelvis, of the pe- rineum, of the groins, of the lower part of the abdo- minal parietes—into the cellular substance of the scrotum, and of the penis—the parts infiltrated de- pending of course on the point at which the urinary canal has given way. Under such circumstances the patient is sometimes rapidly destroyed, the extrava- sated urine appearing to induce speedy sinking, like to the effects of inoculation of the most virulent poi- son. If the urine escape into the cavity of the abdo- men, the patient inevitably perishes, and that very speedily; and when the cellular tissue of the pelvis

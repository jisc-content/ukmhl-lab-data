OF SPINA BIFIDA. 63 dorsal, and sometimes over the sacrum. The size of the swelling varies according to the age of the child, and the extent of deficiency in the parietes of the spinal canal. The spinous processes are either imperfect or altogether wanting, aud over the space so formed the tumour is situated. Its contents are usually of a serous character, thin and colourless ; sometimes they are turbid and flaky. The parietes seem to be a continuation, or protrusion, of the membranes of the spinal chord, thickened and somewhat altered in structure, and usually in close contact with and ad- herent to the integuments. By pressure the size of the tumour is diminished, but, if firm or long con- tinued, unpleasant effects are apt to result. There is often debility of the lower limbs, and the disease is not unfrequently coexistent with hydrocephalus. Children with this affection seldom live more than a few years. The application of gentle, uniform, and continued pressure affords support to the parts, and prevents increase of the tumour ; and under this palliative treatment, life may be both rendered more comfort- able and prolonged. It has been proposed to com- bine continued pressure with occasional puncturing of the cyst by means of a fine needle, with the view of diminishing the tumour and ultimately obtaining entire obliteration of the cyst. The practice has been made trial of, and the result may warrant repe- tition ; caution, however, is necessary, for the too free opening of the tumour often is followed by a rapidly fatal issue.

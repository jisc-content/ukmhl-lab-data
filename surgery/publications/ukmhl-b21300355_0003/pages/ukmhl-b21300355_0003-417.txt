405 EXCISION OF JOINTS. the affection of the bone is only to a limited extent, and when the usual means of cure have had a fair trial and failed, that excision is admissible. In de- termining on the operation, the time of life and the worldly circumstances of the patient are to be con- sidered ; a poor man requires his limb to be service- able in labour, handsome appearance without utility is to him of no value. The motion and usefulness of the arm may be in a great measure preserved, if only a part of the bone of the arm, or a part of those of the forearm, entering into the articulation, be removed ; but if large portions of all of these be taken away, the muscles will lose their support, the motions will never be restored to any extent, and the motion that is will be weak and vacillating. The joint will remain loose and powerless, and the limb will prove to be but a useless incumbrance. Such, at least, is the result of my experience on this subject; and I am sorry to add, that all which has been writ- ten on it is not deserving of unreserved belief. Many patients have, after long and severe suffering, preserved the arm to little purpose; others have been necessitated to submit to another operationâ€” amputation after all; some have died after the first, others after the second mutilation. The operation is attended with no difficulty in execution, and this in some measure accounts for its frequent, and it is to be suspected, indiscriminate, performance of late years. The incisions are made on the posterior aspect of the joint. One is placed in the mesial line, extending from about two inches above the ole- cranon to the same distance below it; and from

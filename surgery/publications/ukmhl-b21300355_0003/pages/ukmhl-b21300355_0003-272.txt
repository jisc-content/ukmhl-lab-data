FRACTURE OF THE I,OWEU JAW. 260 ing from accident, till after all inordinate action has subsided, otherwise adhesion will fail. Cases of fracture of the os malcB and zygoma have been met with. Great displacement cannot occur, nor is any peculiarity of treatment required. It is sufficient to prevent motion of the divided parts, as much as possible, by the application of a bandage. The inferior maxilla is exposed to violence, but from its construction and consistence is capable of resisting a great degree of force. It may be broken at various points ; the usual site of fracture is where the canine or the first small molar tooth is implanted ; but it not unfrequently gives way at the symphysis, or near-the angle. The alveolar processes are often detached, with loosening of one or more teeth. The fracture is frequently compound ; being produced by a direct blow, as the kick of a horse. The bone some- times breaks at a part not struck, as at the symphy- sis from a blow near the angle. The accident is easily recognised ; in fact, the patient, if sensible, has himself discovered fracture before he applies for as- sistance. There is distortion of the part, and the broken extremities, when moved, are felt grating on each other; there is discharge of blood, perhaps of teeth, from the mouth; and in compound fracture the ends of the bone are visible. At the sympliysis the parts are not much displaced ; they are more so when the fracture is in the site of the first molar. In the latter situation it is occasionally difficult to re- place the bone, and retain it in its proper position. The fiice swells to a greater or less extent, accord-

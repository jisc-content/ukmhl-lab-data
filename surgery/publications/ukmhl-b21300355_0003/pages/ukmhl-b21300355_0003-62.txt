50 OF ASCITES. trocar employed is either flat, with a spring-steel canula, or round; when the latter is used, and the abdominal parietes are not very tense, a small inci- sion is first made with a lancet or bistoury ; the flat enters easily, and requires no previous wound, but does not permit so rapid and free a flow. The point usually chosen for the puncture is either in the linea alba, a little below the umbilicus, the blad- der being previously emptied,—a precaution which should always be attended to, though in general there is little danger of wounding this organ—or midway betwixt the superior anterior spinous process of the ilium and the umbilicus, with the view of penetra- ting the parietes in the linea semilunaris. The lat- ter situation, however, can seldom be obtained with accuracy, for the parietes yield irregularly. Little bleeding follows the puncture at either point; but the risk of haemorrhage is greater at the latter, for branches of the circumflex artery may be wounded. More serious bleeding is liable to occur, from the veins ramifying on the abdominal viscera giving waj^ on removal of their support, as the serum flows ofi*. Fainting, also, may take place from accumulation in the branches of the vena portarum, unless the fluid is withdrawn slowly, and the precaution adopted of sup- porting the parietes with a broad band both during and after evacuation. Bandages are made for this purpose, with tapes or straps attached, and are well fitted for it. Three or four yards of flannel, liow- ever, with each end split, is equally effectual, and can always be readily obtained—a consideration of con-

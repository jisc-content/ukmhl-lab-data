CALCULUS VESlCiE, 201 is entire betwixt the external cellular tissue, and that loose and very fine texture immediately exterior to the bladderâ€”betwixt it and the fascia lining the pelvis; thus the risk of urinary infiltration is annulled, at least much diminished. There is great danger in dividing the base of the prostate completely, and much more in cutting any part of the coats of the bladder. When the knife enters the groove of the staff, this instru- ment must be held very steady ; if it be at all with- drawn, its point may escape through the wound, and mislead the knife. There is no great risk of wounding the trunk of the pudic artery, unless by using either a broad in- strument called the gorget, or a concealed knife. The former is now almost wholly abandoned. Besides endangering the pudic, it is apt to lacerate the neck of the bladder, pushing the prostate before it, and so tearing its cellular connexions. The latter, the litho- tome cache, makes the internal wound larger than the external; the coats of the bladder are slit up to an unnecessary extent, being cut much more easily than the prostate, and the instrument not aftording suffi- cient resistance to the gland. Through the prostatic opening the finger is easily passed into the bladder, and the stone felt. The staff is then withdrawn. Sometimes it is troublesome to reach the bladder with the finger, in consequence of the straining and struggling of the patient causing the organ to ascend in the pelvis ; the difficulty is overcome by patiently waiting till these exertions cease. By steady and gradual movements of the finger in the wound of the prostate, the opening is much

309 FRACTURE OF THE LEG. slight; the upper part of the limb is steadied by an assistant, whilst the lower is stretched and moulded by the hands of the surgeon. In compound fractures at this part, the portions of bone completely detached from the hard and soft parts are to be extracted. And if reduction cannot be effected in consequence of a sharp and long end of the bone projecting through a narrow wound, either the portion must be abridged by the saw or cutting pliers, or the wound must be enlarged. Sometimes the one mode is preferable— sometimes the other—occasionally both are required. When the protruding portion composes but a small portion of the shaft, though perhaps of considerable length, it should be taken away ; but when, on the contrary, it is more thick than long, it is better to enlarge the wound ; but on this subject no general rules can be laid down. The splint is the same as that recommended when treating of fractured thigh, composed of a thigh and leg-piece, with a movable foot-board—the double inclined plane, improved by Mr M'Intyre of Newcastle and others. The foot- board is fixed so as to make the leg-piece of the pro- per length, and the splint is secured at a convenient angle. It is padded by means of a cushion filled with fine chaff. The foot is rolled separately; the limb is then raised carefully, and laid down on the splint placed quickly beneath by an assistant; it is retained in a proper position by the hands of the assistant, whilst a roller is carried from the toes round the foot-board, and along the limb to the knee. A broad roller is then made to surround the thigh and

DISTORTION OF THE FEET. 245 tion and the erect position being resumed in a few days. But in the last case, though the extirpation was performed with the utmost care, most violent inflammation supervened; the wound opened, syno- vial secretion flowed out in large quantity, profuse escape of unhealthy matter followed, and exhausting discharge continued for many weeks. At one time the constitutional disturbance was so great as to en- danger life ; the limb was saved with difficulty, the joint anchylosed. From the result of this case, I am disposed to dissuade operative interference, unless the patient strenuously urge it, and be willing to take the responsibility for the consequences on himself. Congenital distortion of the feet appears in many cases to be hereditary ; and often several in one family are born with similar deformities. The foot is turned either outwards or inwards, usually in- wards. The bones of the tarsus may be deficient, or imperfectly formed, but generally are natural in their formation, unnatural merely in their relation to each other and to the ankle-joint, the muscles and tendons being also perfect. In such the deformity can be remedied, during childhood, by mechanical meansâ€” apparatus being worn, contrived so as gradually to bring the parts into a proper relation to each other. In advanced life the deformity is irremediable ; but frequently nature in part removes the impediment to progression, by the formation of adventitious bursas on those parts of the sides of the feet which bear pressure during the erect posture. 3

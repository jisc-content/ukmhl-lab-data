234 LIGATURE OF COMMON ILIAC. inorrhage from branches of either the external or the internal iliac. An incision is made through the abdominal parie- tes, commenced over the passage of the chord through the transverse fascia, and extending upwards, and a little outwards, for five or six inches; its extent de- pending on the size of the patient, the thickness of the parts to be divided, and the consequent depth of the vessel. By this first incision, the skin and su- perficial fascia of the abdomen are divided, and then the muscles are penetrated, the line of the prelimi- nary wound admitting of their being cut in the di- rection of the fibres. After the external oblique has been passed, the proceedings require to be conducted with great caution. The fibres are cut by the hand unsupported, and then the transverse fascia is scratch- ed through, slightly and with great precaution, cut- ting upon the finger or a director introduced at the lower angle of the wound. By means of the finger, the opening is dilated, and the fascia separated from the peritoneum. This membrane and the parts with- in it are then, with the utmost gentleness, pushed in- wards and upwards, by the hands of an assistant, so as to expose the bottom of the wound. The course of the vessel is now felt for, and by separating the edges of the wound, either by the fingers, or by broad and thin copper spatulas, it bifurcation may be seen. About an inch, or less, above this point, the artery is slightly detached from its connexions by the point of the knife, separating it from the vein on its posterior and inner surface, and a blunt point-

324 LUXATION OF THE SHOULDER-JOINT. the blood produces tingling at the points of the fingers, numbness of the whole limb, and after a time swelling of the hand and forearm. Flattening of the shoulder, and depression under the acromion, are the - most prominent marks of displacement having occur- red, and are at once apparent. They are more dis- tinctly perceived on comparing the two shoulders ; then the acromion on the affected side stands remark- ably outwards. The projection is not so apparent when the immediate swelling from effused blood has been fully formed, but the hollow under the acromion can be felt through any quantity of extravasated blood. The arm admits of very little motion, is lengthened, and abducted. The elbow cannot be brought close to the side, and attempts to do so are productive of great suffering. The patient has little or no muscular command over the upper arm. Ro- tation and elevation of the limb require considerable force, and are practicable only to a very limited ex- tent ; during attempts at the former, as already men- tioned, obscure crepitus is sometimes perceived. The abduction is most remarkable in the dislocation directly downwards ; and in this form of the accident, the fingers easily detect the head of the bone lying in the axilla, deep, yet distinct, particularly during attempted rotation. When the head of the bone lies forward under the jjectoralis major, it can be felt, and the prominence occasioned by it can be seen, be- fore swelling has occurred, and after its subsidence. The bone sometimes lodges in an intermediate situa- tion, and then the symptoms peculiar to each form of displacement are mixed. Wlien reduction is not

16 OF HERNIA. small, containing only the round ligament of the uterus. The causes of hernia act equally on both openings, and therefore it is to be expected that pro- trusion will take place where there is the least resist- ance, where the parietes are most deficient. Hernia can seldom be mistaken for any other swell- ing, by one at all acquainted with his profession, and who makes his examination attentively. The history, and the mode of its appearance, are to be at- tended to. The swelling proceeds from above—at times it recedes on the patient lying on his back and making pressure on the swelling—a distinct impulse is communicated to it on exertion of the abdominal muscles, as in coughing—the tumour is generally elastic, and its neck can be felt extending from the lower abdominal aperture. Also, the two kinds, inguinal and crural, can scarcely be confounded with each other; the former is above, the latter below the ligament of Poupart. It will be proper, how- ever, to enumerate shortly the diseases for which hernia may be mistaken. Cirsocele may be confounded with inguinal her- nia. Cirsocele, being a varix of the spermatic veins, enlarges on coughing and during the erect posture, like Hernia; but in general the composition of the tumour can be ascertained by the feel which it im- parts when handled,—the veins feel like a handful of earthworms. Besides, the swelling is made to dis- appear, on emptying the dilated veins by pressure upwards; and if the surgeon then firmly compress the inguinal aperture, the tumour will rapidly re- appear, on account of the venous flow being inter-

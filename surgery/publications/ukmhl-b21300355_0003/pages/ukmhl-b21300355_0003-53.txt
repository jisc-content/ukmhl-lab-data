Afterwards large mild enemata are to be administered, and, after some hours, purgatives, so as to procure copious and free evacuation of the bowels. If the stomach continue unsettled, a sina- pism may be applied to the epigastrium, or solid opium exhibited. Subsequently it may be necessary to bleed locally, or generally, or both ; in other cases the strength from the first requires support. After cicatrization, a well adapted truss must be constantly worn. Umbilical hernia is generally congenital. The ten- dinous parietes are often deficient to a great extent, and there is consequently much fulness along the umbilical chord. The plan of embracing such tumours by ligature, as at one time extensively practised, is now abandoned, there being much risk of peritoneal inflammation and fatal issue.

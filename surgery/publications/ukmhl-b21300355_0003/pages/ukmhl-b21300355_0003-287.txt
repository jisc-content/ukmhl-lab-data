INJURIES OF THE SHOUI.DEr.. 275 unnatural form. But these indications of the injury gradually disappear. More extensive solution of the continuity of the bone takes place, generally in consequence of a direct and violent blow on the shoulder. The patient is unable to raise the arm, though with great pain it can be placed in any position that it occupies natu- rally ; it can be abducted and raised, perhaps to a greater extent and more readily than when sound. The shoulder is flattened, and the limb apparently lengthened. The elbow is readily put to the side. On raising the humerus, rotating it, and moving it to and fro, crepitation is distinctly perceived—but not so readily after swelling has taken place. The swell- ing also obscures the appearances observed imme- diately after the infliction of the injury,—the flatten- ing of the shoulder, and apparent elongation of the arm. By the fingers of one hand, pressed deep into the axilla, the head of the humerus can be discover- ed ; and on rotating the shaft of the bone with the other hand, grasping the elbow and pushing upwards at the same time, crepitation is perceived, and the upper portion of the bone is ascertained to be unaf- fected by the rotation of the shaft. The nature of the injury is then sufficiently apparent. But the shaft of the humerus may, by such mani- pulation, be ascertained to be entire. Still, from the direction of the force which effected the injury, the flattening of the shoulder, the remarkable falling down of the arm, the loss of power, the free motion, and from the crepitation, though perhaps indistinct,

EXCISION OF JOINTS. 404 terfere with the retentive apparatus. The discharge gradually ceases, and cicatrisation is obtained, though not till after a considerable time, at least in general. The cut ends of the bones accommodate themselves to each other, and a sort of new joint is formedâ€”but never strong. The motions of the forearm are per- fect, though perhaps weakened ; those of the upper arm are very incomplete. I have both performed and assisted in the operation frequently, and never expe- rienced any difficulty; a cure has not always fol- lowed, but in some cases the limb has become very useful. The elbow-joint, on account of its exposed condi- tion, is generally regarded as the most favourable for excision. As to the truth of this opinion, there is great room for doubt. The affections of the joints of the upper extremity are much more manageable than those of the lower, and may generally be pre- vented from proceeding so far as to end in destruc- tion of the apparatus. By care and good manage- ment, disease will be ai'rested, and the functions and motions of the parts restored and preserved; or the articulation may become stiff, and even though the anchylosis be complete, the limb will be v^ry useful if the joint have been kept in a good position. The health, if previously undermined, is renovated, so soon as the local disease is arrested. But some bad cases are met with, in which all the parts surround- ing the articulation are involved, and the strength wasted; in these, amputation is the only safe and effectual procedure. It is only when the soft parts are not much diseased, when it is ascertainable that

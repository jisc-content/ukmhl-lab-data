Small hernia?, and those of recent origin, are with difficulty reduced ; their neck is narrow, and the passage proportionately small; the crural are usually of this description. In all hernise, after strangulation has existed for some time, and adhesions formed, par- ticularly at the neck, reduction is almost impossible. The taxis is to be neither attempted nor perse- vered in after the hernia has become tender and inflamed. No good can be done by it, and the pa- tient's chance of recovery by operation is much dimi- nished. Even when no pain is felt in such circum- stances, any degree of force must be prejudicial. Mor- tification of the bowels is often hastened by the taxis being unskilfully employed by ill-informed practi- tioners, who are determined, at all risks, to accom- plish speedy reduction of the viscera. Men, even eminent, may declare that they always succeed in the taxis, but such practice is highly dangerous. The surgeon will take care to inform himself of all particulars,—as to the duration of strangulation, the previous state of the tumour, if it was all, or only in part reducible, as to its size, &c.,—before proceeding in any way. Great mischief is likely to accrue from the tumour being handled, perhaps roughly, by many people. Certain means may assist the taxis, but they should not be long continued or often repeated. Venesection can be employed only in strong plethoric patients, in the very first stage of strangulation, and before the

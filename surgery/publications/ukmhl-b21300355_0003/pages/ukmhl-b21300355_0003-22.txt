10 OF HERNIA. fibres, hernia may occur suddenly, and even in the best formed parts, from very violent exertionâ€”as in leaping, wrestling, pulling, lifting heavy weights ; from sudden exertion of the abdominal muscles in any way ; from blows, &c. Or the protrusion may come on gradually, after slight exertions, where the tendons are naturally weak or deficient; or it may be slowly induced by repeated and almost constant mus- cular action, as in urinary, intestinal, and pulmonary complaints ; in such cases, slight pain is usually felt at the site of the protrusion before the tumour is perceived. The disease is often congenital. But the common cause of abdominal hernia is powerful action of the abdominal muscles, compressing the viscera to a greater or less degree, and with more or less suddenness ; the viscera resisting the compressing force, react on the parietes, and these, yielding at the points which are naturally weak or deficient, permit enlargement of the coerced cavity by pro- trusion of part of the contents. When the com- pression and reaction are sudden and violent, the protrusion is the same ; but when the former are not sufficient to overcome the cohesion of the parietes by a single occurrence, but by repetition gradually effect the morbid end, the hernia is proportionally slow in Hiaking its appearance, and gradual in its increase. ' To understand the nature of congenital scrotal hernia, the student must recollect that the testicle in the foetus is lodged in the cavity of the abdomen, immediately below the kidneys, and resting on the psoas muscle ; that it gradually descends into a pro- cess of peritoneum, called spermatic, which extends

FRACTURE OF THE PATELLA. 303 position, a space is felt in the situation of the patella, the lower portion is found nearly in its place, but the other is drawn upwards on the fore part of the thigh ; by extension of the limb and flexure of the thigh the portions are approximated, and crepitus is perceived when they are brought in contact. These symptoms are perceptible through any quantity of bloody eifu- sion. By attentive manipulation, comminution and vertical splitting may also be detected. The circum- stances attending the accident will, in most instances, lead to a tolerably accurate expectation of the state of parts. The ligament of the patella does not give way to muscular action; it is much stronger than the bone, and the latter consequently snaps. It may be, and has been, divided, along with the superimposed inte- gument, by a fall on a sharp substance. This acci- dent is followed by lameness, the ligamentous tissue does not soon unite, and the limb is long in regain- ing its usefulness ; sometimes the union is imperfect, and the member remains weak. Division of the integuments over a fractured pa- tella is a very serious accident. The joint is opened, and such a state both of the limb and of the consti- tution must sooner or later occur as to cause neces- sity for amputation. The bone unites, under favourable circumstances, in the same way as any other. In longitudinal frac- ture there is almost always bony union. In trans- verse, the obstacles to correct apposition are great;

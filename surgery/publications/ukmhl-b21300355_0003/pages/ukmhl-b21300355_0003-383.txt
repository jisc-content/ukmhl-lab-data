AMPUTATION. 371 tringeuts, and even the cautery, are useless. Liga- ture of the main arterial trunk, above the origin of branches supplying the stump, so as to weaken for a time the circulation, is found to be effectual. I have had recourse to this in many cases, and uniformly with success. Some years ago, several occurred in the Royal Infirmary, within a very short time of one another ; it was during rather an unhealthy sea- son, and at the time I was making trial of cutting off both ends of the ligatures. They were all after re- moval of the lower limb; one patient diedâ€”the am- putation was high, through the trochanter minor, and the vessel tied secondarily was the common iliac ; this had the effect of completely arresting the haemor- rhage, but the previous loss of blood proved too much for the system to recover from ; transfusion was had recourse to, and produced temporary benefit. The others, cases of amputation below the knee, made most favourable recoveries after ligature of the super- ficial femoral, and in more than one the stump healed very rapidly after its readjustment. Indeed it is not unfrequently found that when the flaps are separated, from whatever cause, and replaced when the granulations have appeared, there follows a rapid union and cure. When healing by the first intention has failed, fomentation and poultices are generally the most grateful and beneficial applications for a day or two. Afterwards, when suppuration has been fairly esta- blished, and the stump begins to be flabby and oede- matous, simple dressing and uniform support by bandaging are required, sometimes along with com-

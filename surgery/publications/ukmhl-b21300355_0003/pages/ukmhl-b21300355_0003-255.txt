CARTILAGINOUS BODIES IN KNEE-JOINT. 243 rial plaster, causes gradual decrease by absorption ; the causes of the affection being at the same time studiously avoided. Unyielding parts, habituated to pressure, defend themselves by the interposition betwixt them and the surface of a movable bag containing fluid ; the cel- lular tissue condenses into a cyst, its internal surface assuming a serous appearance, and secreting a fluid resembling the synovial. Such adventitious bursEe are not unfrequent on the ancles and feet, as in tailors, or others usually sitting cross-legged. They may attain a considerable size, and so produce defor- mity ; but they should not be interfered with unless they become inconvenient, as from excited action. When the extremity of the metatarsal bone of the great toe is large, and consequently the seat of pres- sure, a bursal formation is produced in the soft parts covering it; this from increase of pressure, or other irritation, may inflameâ€”forming the painful and troublesome disease termed Bunion. Sometimes un- healthy abscess occurs, with thickening, infiltration, and condensation of the surrounding cellular tissue; in such cases, incision and poultice are required, and occasionally it is necessary to destroy the unsound cellular tissue and the degenerated cyst by free appli- cation of the caustic potass. The cyst is thus got rid of, healthy granulation takes place, and by afterwards avoiding undue pressure upon the part, a permanent cure is obtained. It has been elsewhere mentioned, that cartilaginous bodies sometimes form within articulating cavities,

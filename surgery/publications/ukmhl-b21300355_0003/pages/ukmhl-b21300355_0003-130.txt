118 STRICTURE OF THE URETHRA. more necessary when the stricture is of an elastic na- ture. Considerable experience is requisite to enable the surgeon to be aware of the progress he is making with the instrument, and whether or not it is ad- vancing fairly in the canal; much information as to this is imparted by the sense of feeling. If the point of the instrument be within the contracted part, it will be felt embraced and obstructed, and on withdraw- ing the pressure, it will be stationary ; if it have not entered the stricture, but is pushing it before it, resi- lience will be felt as soon as the pressure is either di- minished or removed. The sensation imparted when the instrument has left the canal, and is forming a false passage, is of a peculiar grating nature, and when once felt, will scarcely be forgotten or mista- ken. By means of a good knowledge of the natural course of the urethra, and an acquaintance with the feelings just alluded to, but which cannot be graphi- cally described, the surgeon of experience is enabled to avoid blunders, and to pass an instrument with safety through the tightest strictures. It is, how- ever, an operation of very great difficulty in aggra- vated cases, perhaps the most difficult in surgery; facility in passing the catheter is acquired only by practice and experience. The greatest caution is re- quired, along with considerable fortitude and perse- verance ; there is always a risk of making false passages,—the most dexterous surgeon may so err in-a moment of negligence oi'- i'aslmess,—and when once established, it is a difficult matter to avoid them.

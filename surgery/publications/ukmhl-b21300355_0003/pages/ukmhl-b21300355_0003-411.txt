399 EXCISION OF DISEASED BONES. ed, have been able to bear up against the shock of one and a successful operation, but he cannot endure that of a second, or perhaps third, serious and pro- tracted attack of the knivesman. The disappointed hope of a cure is a secondary, though nevertheless a sure contributor towards the unfortunate issue. No particular rules can be laid down for the opera- tive procedure. By converting two or more natural openings into one, extending the incisions as much as possible in the direction of the limb and of the muscles and tendons, and avoiding the course of the larger bloodvessels and nerves, room is made for an accurate examination of the diseased parts. A strong and firmly pointed knife is required for these inci- sions, for the soft parts are much consolidated, and are cut with difficulty. The extent of disease is ascer- tained both by the probe and by the finger, and far- ther measures, if necessary, are then adopted for com- plete removal. Loose portions of bone are taken away; and often large sequestra of the cancellated tis- sue are found lying in the cavity, either loose or easily separable ; for extraction, forceps and the fingers, and sometimes a lever, are required. A firm scoop is useful for removing such portions of diseased cancel- lated tissue as are still continuous with the shaft of the bone. When an opening in the cancellated tissue, leading to an internal sequestrum, is minute, enlarge- ment is effected by means of either the trephine or the cutting pliers ; afterwards, gouges, gravers, &c., may sometimes be useful in operating on the soft texture underneath,â€”but they are seldom requisite.

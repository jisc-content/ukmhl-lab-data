AMPUTATION OF THE FlNGEllS. ii77 the metacarpal bone along with the finger. The me- thod of incision will vary according to the extent to which the bone is diseased. When the operation is required for disease of merely the distal extremity, the incisions are made in the same form as for ampu- tation of the joint, only they are on each side suffi- ciently high to be beyond diseased bone. They may either be made from below upwards in the usual way, or be commenced at their highest point on the dorsum of the metacarpal bone. After the soft parts have been separated from the bone, by a few touches of the knife after formation of the principal incisions, removal is completed by either the cutting pliers or the metacarpal bow-sawâ€”the former I have found the more convenient instrument. It is applied perpen- dicularly, and should always have its smooth surface in contact with the part to be retained, otherwise the cut part will be rough and irregular. Section is com- pleted more rapidly than by the saw, and, by atten- tion to the above precaution, the stump is equally smooth, if not more so. The wound is brought and retained in contact by approximation of the fingers. But in taking away any considerable portion of the metacarpal bone, it is of importance to preserve the palm uninjured. With this view, the knife is entered over the dorsal centre of the bone, above the diseased part, and carried straight downwards till near the articulation, when it is made to diverge for the for- mation of lateral flaps ; the integuments in the track of the longitudinal wound are then dissected back- wards, so as to expose the bone completely, and the

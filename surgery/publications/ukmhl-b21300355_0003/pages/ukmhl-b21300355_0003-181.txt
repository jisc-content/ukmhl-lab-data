Rest is enjoined ; and a radical cure is not to be attempted till the fluid has collected a second, or perhaps a third time, and become colour- less. Acute inflammation of the testicle, from sympathy with the urethra, and sudden suppression of discharge from the anterior part of the canal, has been already treated of. The inflammation may also be the result of external violence. When the urethra is diseased, the testicle is irritable, and its circulation easily ex- cited. After subsidence of the inflammatory attack, swelling, particularly of the epididymis, or of the posterior part of the gland, seldom altogether disap- pears. The new matter is not entirely absorbed ; and thickening and induration remain, to an extent depending on the violence of the action and the pro- priety of the treatment. Enlargements of the body of th.e gland are gene- rally attributed to injury. But often they occur with- out such cause being assignable; and may be the result of chronic excited action, kindled in deposit produced by a previous acute inflammatory attack. Such indolent swellings attain considerable size. The tumour is of an irregular surface, and feels hard and unyielding; there is always more or less effusion of fluid into the cavity of the tunica vaginalis, add- ing to the bulk of the swelling. Indeed, the size and consistence of the tumour can be correctly ascertained only after evacuation of this fluid.

CALCULUS VESICA. 1H9 On one occasion, when operating on the dead body, I found that the instrument had got several stones in its grasp, and was kept so dilated as to be withdrawn with much difficulty—there being no means of disentangling the stones but by farther expansion of the blades, which was impossible. A great many foreign bodies—pieces of pebble—had been introduced; but had the same number of uri- nary concretions been laid hold of—which is scarcely possible—those farthest from the point and most compressed would have crumbled down, and thus the expansion of the blades would have been dimi- nished. I have experienced not the least difficulty in operating with this instrument, in numerous cases, and at all periods of life. The safety of the proceed- ing is its greatest recommendation. It is very sel- dom that any unpleasant symptoms follow ; there may perhaps be a trifling effusion of blood, and some slight pain in making water may continue for a day or ^o. Should either irritability of the bladder, or symptoms indicating inflammation of the mucous coat supervene, these must forthwith be combated. Concretions of such a size as cannot be made to pass through the neck of the bladder, and along the urethra, and yet are not much larger than a filbert, may, if soft and friable, be laid hold of in the bladder by properly contrived instruments, and acted upon so as to be reduced to powder and fragments, which may either pass off along with the urine, or be ex- tracted by means of forceps. This proceeding is not advisable in children, owing to the small size of the

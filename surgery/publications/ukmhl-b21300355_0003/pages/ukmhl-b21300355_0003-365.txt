The application of cold at any- period is of little use, and ought certainly to be avoid- ed immediately after the injury, as adding to the sufferings of the patient, and interfering with the natural processes which have commenced for the reparation of that injury. In limbs that have remained stiff after severe and mismanaged sprain, the dashing of water, either cold or tepid, has been strongly recommended. The prac- tice is not ineffectual; the vessels of the surface are excited, perhaps as by other friction, and perhaps by the reaction which follows the chill. But the limb is apt to become rheumatic ; and, on this account, the state of matters will not be improved by this pro- ceeding, unless it be resorted to with proper precau- tions. In severe sprains there is reason to think that sometimes even the tendons yield a littleâ€”that many of the fibres give way, and that thus the tendon is thinned and elongated. Such injury happens ofter? in horses, in what is called breaking down. In them the tendon is occasionally snapped entirely through, and the ends widely separated. The same occurs in the human subject. Separation of the muscular fibres, however, is rare ; laceration of the tendon itself, or separation of the tendon from the muscle, is more common. The yielding of the broad tendons on the upper and fore, lateral and under parts of the abdo- men, affords an example of laceration of tendinous fibre from violent exertion.

I'HAC'TUllES. 248 brought nearly straight. Complete solution of con- tinuity, though more rare, is occasionally met with in very young subjects. Fractures are generally the result of great force applied directly to the shaft of a bone, or to its ex- tremity ; but they are also not unfrequently caused by twisting of a limb whilst the muscles are in powerful action. Bones are broken transversely; but more frequently there is a degree of obliquity in the fracture, and fragments are generally detached. A bone may be split longitudinally, as from a musket- ball striking its shaft in the centre ; and fissures often extend from a cross break to a considerable extent, sometimes into joints. Swelling is often rapid, from extravasation of blood ; at other times it is slow, and of a serous cha- racter. At first it is soft and yielding, but after a time painful inflammatory tumescence supervenes, the violence and extent of which will depend on the severity of the injury, and very much also on the treatment to which the parts are subjected. If the bones be put as nearly as possible into their original position, and retained so, judiciously—the limb being- laid in a comfortable and unconstrained posture, and the bandages, splints, &c., properly adapted—little or no pain or inflammatory swelling Avill occur.; no more action ensues than is required for reparation of the injury. If, on the contrary, the bones are allowed to remain unreduced—perhaps after being well hand- led—their broken ends, lying among the soft parts, are pulled about by violent spasms, laceration of the muscles and vessels is increased, effusion, swelling,

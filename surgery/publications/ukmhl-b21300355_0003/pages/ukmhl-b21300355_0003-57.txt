45 OF HERNIA. the bowel to the opening in the skinâ€”its narrowest part being at the latter situation, its most capacious surrounding the intestine. The cellular tissue in- termediate between the integument and hernial sac becomes condensed, and forms a membranous li- ning. By this cavity an imperfect communica- tion is established between the two portions of bowel, part of the faeculent matter returning through the lower intestinal orifice, and part escaping exter- nally. But this communication must be indeed very imperfect at first, since the two portions of bowel lie parallel to each other, and their coalescing sides form an acute angular projection into this funnel- shaped cavity. The lower portion is necessarily much diminished in calibre, being in a great measure unaccustomed to the usual distension, and its col- lapsed orifice is retracted a little higher than that of the superior. On account of these circumstances faeculent matter cannot pass straight onwards from one portion of bowel to the other, but must first tra- verse the funnel-shaped cavity; and even then it is but a small quantity that reaches the rectum. In- deed, in most cases of artificial anus, nothing but oc- casional flatus passes by the original outlet for weeks or months. After some time the bowel retracts, but cannot leave the adhesion in the groin; by this re- traction the orifices may be brought in a more direct line with each other, and the natural passage of the faeces be somewhat assisted. When one or more slight patches of discolouration are observed after division of the sac, it may be re-

FRACTURE OF THE LEG. 310 splint, and having been turned several times round the loins, is secured to the upper part of the cushion. The limb is thus rendered independent of the mo- tions of the trunk ; it is made as of a piece with the splint. The wound, if any, is to be approximated. If discharge follow, part of the bandage may be un- done from day to day, for the purpose either of employing fomentation or of applying suitable dress- ing, and still the limb is kept perfectly steady. Ab- scesses must be opened early—spiculae removed— constitutional symptoms warded off, and, if they do occur, combated,—at one time inflammatory action must be kept down—at another and more advanced stage, the strength must be supported by all means. In simple fracture it is seldom necessary to undo the bandage, till the apparatus is loosened by subsidence of the swelling—and if the fracture be early reduced, and kept steady, that will be but slight. Then the bandages are undone and reapplied, and the po- sition of the limb attended to. It is seldom neces- sary to interfere with the leg during readjustment, but should there be any deviation, even considerable, from the proper position, it is easily remedied at the end of the first, second, third, or even of the fourth week ; but the sooner the better. The patient may be removed from bed, and may sit up during the greater part of the day, with the heel on a level with the pelvis, within the first week. His health, appe- tite, and spirits, are thus kept up, sore back is avoid- ed, the tedium of confinement diminished, and the cure greatly accelerated. At the end of five, six,

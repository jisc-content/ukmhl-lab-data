175 CASTJIATION. I have never found either practice necessary; the latter retards the operation ; the fingers of an assist- ant are generally as effectual as a ligature, and inflict less injury to the parts and less pain to the patient. Should the chord slip, there can be but little diffi- culty in pulling down the artery by means of a hook ; at the worst, slight extension of the inci- sion upwards may be necessary. The scrotum is to be sponged clean of coagula, and its bleeding vessels secured; often they are numerous. The incision is brought together by several points of suture, and cold cloths applied. In no operation is secondary bleed- ing more frequent, occurring within an hour or two after reaction has been established, and the patient begun to get warm in bed. The flow is always from the scrotal vessels in the lower part of the wound, and often profuse. The dressing must be partially undone, so as to expose the vessels, and permit of the application of ligature. On this account, it is well not to approximate the lower part of the wound in the first instance, but to fill the cavity with charpie or dry lint, retaining this until risk of haemorrhage has passed over, and then to bring the edges toge- ther. The upper part of the incision often heals by the first intention, but this is seldom effected in the lower ; sui)puration takes place, and the cavity fills up slowly by granulation. Indeed, attempts to pro- cure primary union of the scrotal wound are scarcely to be recommended ; they are very seldom effectual; and should bleeding take place, the patient is either

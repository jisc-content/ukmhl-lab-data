263 FllACTUllE OF THE SPINE. ally the bodies are broken entirely through, with con- siderable displacement, the upper or lower end, as may be, projecting. There is twisting or bending of the trunk or neck, the articulating processes on one side only being displaced, whilst the ligaments on the other remain pretty entire. In some cases, either the spinous processes, or the articular, are separated without yielding of the bodies of the ver- tebrae, or of the interposed substance ; then there is bending of the trunk forwards. The symptoms vary according to the site of the injury, and the extent of violence inflicted on the spinal chord. This important organ may suffer con- cussion without fracture or displacement of the bones, its functions may be consequently more or less dis- turbed, and paralysis occasioned of those parts that are supplied with nerves from below the injured point. Without fracture, too, vessels may give way within the canal, and by compression from effused fluid urgent symptoms will be produced. The power of motion may be lost whilst sensation is retained, and vice versa ; but in general both are either impaired or destroyed. In one case that I attended, there was power of motion in one limb and no sensation, whilst in the other there was no motion but the usual sensation. Patients may recover from the effects of a severe blow on the spinal column and consequent concussion of the chord, but very frequently they do not. Changes may take place at a late period in the chord or its membranes, in consequence of the injury—as thick- ening of the coverings—bloody, serous, purulent, or

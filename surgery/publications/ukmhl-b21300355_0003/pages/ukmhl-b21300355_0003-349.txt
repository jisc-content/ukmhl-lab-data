337 LUXATION OF. THE TIILTMIi. the true nature of the injury; but the treatment is very difficult and puzzling even in the hands of the best informed surgeons. The base of the bone seems to slip through the lateral ligaments, and remain firmly locked in their embrace; and these being very strong, and in a state of complete tension, defy all usual at- tempts at reduction. The end of a silk handkerchief is to be attached to the distal extremity of the displa- ced phalanx, by means of the clove-hitch ; and with this extension is made, either by the surgeon alone, or by one or more assistants,—frequently several are required. Counter-extension is made by the surgeon or assistant grasping the forearm, or another hand- kerchief may be passed betwixt the thumb and fore- finger for an assistant to pull by. The extending force should be made in a direction towards the palm, and almost uniformly requires to be great and long continued, even in recent cases. The bone may occasionally be jerked into its place by a sudden attempt at flexion of the joint, during steady pull- ing that has been continued for some time. But cases have occurred in which all attempts have proved ineffectual, and it has been found necessary to divide one of the lateral ligaments. From what has been already stated, the reason why this proceeding should facilitate reduction is sufficiently obvious. I have had recourse to it in but one instance,—one in which difficulty of reduction was not to have been expected. The accident was very recent, not an hour had elapsed ; the patient was an old man, and very drunk ; no resistance to the reductive measures PART III. Y

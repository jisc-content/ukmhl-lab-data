AMPUTATION OF TUK FOREARM. 380 incision, but the nearer to the elbow the better is the stump ; at the wrist tlie flaps are composed principally of integuments and tendons, and the cushion so formed for the bones is very inferior to one of muscle. Compression is made and the limb steadied ' as before, the surgeon with his left hand grasps the wrist, and places the forearm in the middle state be- tween pronation and supination. In the right forearm, the knife, held perpendicularly, is entered over the centre of the radius ; and its point, after reaching the bone, is inclined inwards so as to pass round it; trans- fixion is then made, the knife passing close to the palmar surface of the bones, and emerging at a point opposite to its entrance; and then by rapid motion downwards and inwards a proper flap is formed. The instrument is again introduced over the radius, at a little distance from the upper part of the first wound, and passed on the opposite side of the bones, emerging also in the first incision and at a similar point; another flap is made. These are retracted, the knife is swept round the bones, and passed freely be- tween them, to divide the remaining muscular sub- stance, and after this has been completed the saw is applied. During the sawing it is well to preserve the limb in the same position as during the incisions, and to apply the instrument perpendicularly; thus both bones will be divided at once, and the risk of splintering diminished. In transfixion, great care is required that the point of the knife pass across, not between,the bones,and with this view a slight change of position is useful; during the transfixion for the

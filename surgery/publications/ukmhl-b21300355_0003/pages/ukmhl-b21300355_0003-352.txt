340 LUXATION OF THE HIP-JOINT. the limb by a screw, and provided with suitable straps for attachment of the pulleys, is very useful,— fully more convenient than the common woollen laque. Extension may be made by one or more as- sistants ; but this may prove ineffectual, and it is better at once to have recourse to the pulleys : these are not alarming to the patient, and, being efficient, will in the end materially diminish his suffering. The extension should be gradual, steady, and persevering; the rotation of the limb during extension should be principally outwards, effected by laying hold of the ankle, and using the leg as a lever. This motion is peculiarly successful when the bone has yielded a little to the extension, when it has changed its place, and come nearly on a line with the cotyloid cavity. In some cases, even of no long standing, auxiliary means are required,—bleeding, antimony, &c. as formerly noticed. In old cases, no attempts at reduction should be made until the patient has been brought into a re- laxed state, approaching to collapse, by one or more of the auxiliary means, and by such as are best suit- ed to the particular circumstances of the case ; in such instances also the extension, rotation, &c. must be persevered in for some time,—they are not at once successful. Frequently, particularly in recent cases, reduction is accompanied and indicated by an audible and perceptible snap, occasioned by the head of the bone slipping into the cotyloid cavity ; the motions are again readily performed, and the limb resumes its proper length and shape. The muscular and articu- lating apparatus must be kept quiet for some time

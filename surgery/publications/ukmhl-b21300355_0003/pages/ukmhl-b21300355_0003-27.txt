15 OF HERNIA. from the edge of the external ring, and the superfi- cial fascia of the abdomen. The direct has only the last. The oblique inguinal, when recent and small, is termed Bubonocele ; but when large, it generally de- scends into the scrotum—oscheocele—of course exte- rior to the tunica vaginalis ; and in females into the labium. The tumour often attains an immense size, from continued application of the causes that produced it,—laborious occupations, or straining of muscles in any way. When of long duration, and not attended to, it is not uncommon for the swelling to hang as low as the middle of the thigh, or even down to the knee. In such cases, the testicles often are wasted, and the penis concealed ; indeed the skin of the penis^ as well as of the lower part of the abdomen, is stretched over the tumour. Crural or femoral hernia is, on the contrary, seldom larger than a small apple. Sometimes, but very rarely, the tumour is of large dimensions. I have seen one containing the transverse arch of the colon, the omentum, and a yard and a half of small intestine. When a very large hernia remains always full, the cavity of the abdomen diminishes in size ; in fact, it adapts itself to its contents; and this must be kept in mind when interfering with such cases. Inguinal hernia most frequently occurs in males, the femoral in females ; and the reason of this is ob- vious on comparing the size of the inguinal and crural openings in the male and female. In the male, the inguinal opening is much larger than the femoral; in the female, the femoral is the larger, the inguinal is

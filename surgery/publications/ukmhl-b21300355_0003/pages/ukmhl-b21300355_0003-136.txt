RETENTION OF URINE. 124 is the seat of the extravasation, little hope can be entertained of recovery, though the fatal termination may not be so rapid as in the former case. When the urine is effused into more external parts, as into the perineum or scrotum, the danger is also im- minent, if the fluid is allowed to accumulate and become extensively infiltrated ; but when it freely escapes externally, either spontaneously or by inci- sion, there need in general be no great apprehension of immediate danger. In such cases the aperture in the urethra is found to be at first irregular and ragged ; afterwards its inner surface becomes rounded off, and a papilla presents externally. The infiltrated cellular tissue is dark, foetid, broken down, and soft, some- times seemingly in part dissolved by the putrescent urine ; and, when the patient has survived a con- siderable time, it frequently resembles closely in ap- pearance a portion of suppurated lung. When active practice is not adopted after extravasation of urine has taken place, the cellular tissue around sloughs along with the integuments ; rapid depression of the powers of life ensues, with great disturbance of the sensorial functions. Death very soon relieves the pa- tient from his sufferings ; some few struggle through, and recover, after losing the coverings of the penis, of the testicles, and of the perineum. The causes of retention are many; but the sur- geon must know them all, as the treatment must vary according to the cause. They may be divided into such as weaken the power of expulsion, and into such as impede the progress of the urine in the urethra.

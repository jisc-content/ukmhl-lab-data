391 AMPUTATION OF THE LiiO. missible ; sufficiency of soft parts, for the protection of the stump, canuot be procured lower than the calf. Incision is consequently limited to two points, either immediately below the tuberosity of the tibia, or in the bellies of the gastrocnemii. The former is the situation to be preferred in hospital practice, and amongst the lower orders generally ; the latter is suitable to the better classes of society, that is, to those who can afford to purchase an expensive artifi- cial support. The amputation below the tibial tube- rosity being the most frequently required, will, with propriety, be described first. Suppose the right leg is to suffer.â€”The operator places himself on its inner side, according to the general rule formerly incul- cated, and grasps the lower part of the limb with his left hand, an assistant supporting the foot at a proper height, and controlling motion. The knife is entered over the fibula, on its outer aspect, and carried up- wai'ds along that bone for an inch and a half, or two inches; it is then brought across the limb in a semi- lunar direction, and after reaching the inner and lower part of the tibia transfixion is performed, the instrument being pushed along the posterior surface of the bones, and made to emerge at the upper part of the fibular incision. By then carrying the knife downwards, a posterior flap is formed sufficient to cover the stump. All this is effected by uninter- rupted sweeps of the knife, that is, without ever re- moving the point from the track of incision. The integuments on the fore part are then dissected up- wards a little, by a few touches of the knife, so as to form a small semilunar flap ; at this part of the ope-

TREATMENT. 79 may be either partial or complete, as the case may seem to require. In most cases, the tumour can be got rid of only by the knife or ligature. When the piles are internal, removal by ligature is to be pre*- ferred ; the patient being made to strain, and thereby bring the tumours as low as possible, a ligature is placed round the base of the swelling, provided its form conveniently admits of it; otherwise the base is pierced by a fixed needle armed with a double liga- ture, the separate portions of which are applied tight- ly to the corresponding parts of the base. Before pro- ceeding to this measure, the bowels should be emptied by mild and repeated purgatives, and afterwards all stimuli should be avoided. It is imprudent to apply ligature to several tumours at once, for serious consequences will most probably ensue, inflammation of the bowel, obstinate constipation, and general excitement. Excision of such piles is contraindicated by the risk of profuse haemorrhage. The bleeding is into the cavity of the bowel, a coagulum is there formed which encourages the flow; and from this cause, and the peculiar situation of the bleeding point, it is with difficulty arrested. When the tu- mours are external, ligature may be adopted ; but here there is no objection to the use of the knife, and excision is less painful and more speedy. The tu- mours, along with protruded portions of the mucous lining of the rectum that cannot be reduced, and are changed in structure and function, are readily taken away by the rapid stroke of sharp curved scissors. Or they may be laid hold of and stretched, and their base divided by one or more sweeps of a bistoury or

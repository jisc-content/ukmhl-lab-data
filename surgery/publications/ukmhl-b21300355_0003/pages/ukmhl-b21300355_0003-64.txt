Many such swellings may be punctured both with advantage and with safety, but generally the tapping requires frequent repetition. Some patients require tapping, merely as a mean of improving the figure and relieving uneasy feelings, once, twice, or thrice a year ; their existence is not much embittered or abridged by the disease. A large round trocar is necessary for the purpose ; and the puncture is made at the softest and most pro- minent point of the tumour, a small incision through the integument being premised. The ovaria become enlarged by degeneration of their structure and the addition of solid matter in great abundance.

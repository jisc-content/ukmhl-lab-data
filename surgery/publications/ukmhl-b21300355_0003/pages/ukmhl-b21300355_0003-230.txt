218 CALCULUS VESICA. symptoms are similar to those which have been de- scribed as indicating stone in the other sex. Sound- ing is easy; it is performed with an instrument slight- ly bent at the farther extremity, and considerably shorter than those employed in the male. Even when the calculi are of considerable size, they can be removed, as well as other foreign matter, by dila- tation of the urethra, effected gradually. Portions of gentian root, and sponge tents, were formerly used for this purpose ; but of late years various dilators have been contrived. Some are really new, others have been published as such though correctly repre- sented in works some hundred years old. Their blades are made to separate in a parallel direction by pecu- liar adaptation of the screw; and by gradually and very slowly increasing their separation, uniform dila- tation is effected. Soon it is sufficient to admit the finger ; then the size of the stone is ascertained, and, if necessary, the dilatation is continued to a sufficient extent. When thus the canal has been widened so as to admit of the passage of the stone, forceps are intro- duced, and extraction accomplished hi a direction downwards, that is towards the vagina. Inconti- nence of urine is apt to continue for some time after this operation, if the dilatation have been consider- able, as well as after the removal of larger stones by incision. Incision has been proposed in various directionsâ€” into the vagina, or by the side of it, upwards and outwards; and it has also been recommended to cut

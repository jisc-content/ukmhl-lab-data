The sooner the method en deux temps is expunged from the list of surgical operations, the better will it be for suffering humanity and the credit of our art. In those rare cases in which the stone is so large that it cannot be brought through the outlet of the pelvis, it must either be broken into fragments, or removed entire through incision above the pubes; as already stated, it is probable that the high opei'a- tion is the safer proceeding. It is, however, an ope- ration attended with much danger. The wound is necessarily extensive, and important parts are liable to be interfered with ; and, from not being depend- ent, the escape of the urine by it is almost certain to cause infiltration of the cellular tissue surrounding the bladder—an occurrence almost alwaj'^s proving fatal, and that rapidly. The first part of the proce- dure is to insure distension of the bladder, so that it may rise in the pelvis, and afford sufficient space be- tween its lower part and the anterior reflection of the peritoneum ; but this may prove either very difficult, or altogether impossible, even with the aid of injec- tion by the urethra, in consequence of the unyielding

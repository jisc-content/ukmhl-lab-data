STlllCTUllE OF THE URETHRA. 108 existence of the bridle. The urethra is sometimes narrowed by a circular membranous ring projecting into its canal, composed of swollen mucous mem- brane with subjacent effusion, and presenting the appearance of a thread having been tied round the passage. Other strictures occupy a considerable por- tion of the urethra, from a quarter of an inch to two or three inches; differing from the preceding only in the effusion and membranous swelling being more extensive. Others are irregular, the contraction being not uniform at the narrowed point, and sometimes only one side of the canal is affected. Some are almost cartilaginous, the effused lymph having be- come much condensed after organisation; others are less dense in their structure, and exceedingly elastic. From repeated attacks of inflammation at the constricted part, and around, additional lymph is effused and organised, and thus the extent and tight- ness of the stricture is increased. The urethra is generally constricted at those parts which are naturally the tightest; at the orifice— betwixt three and four inches from the orifice—and betwixt six and seven inches from the orifice; the most frequent site is perhaps anterior to the sinus. Contraction of the orifice is frequently the conse- quence of cicatrisation, and generally proves obsti- nate ; in some cases the smallest probe is passed with difficulty. Considerable portions of the anterior part of the canal suffer contraction from the efiect of ulcer- ation ; and congenital malformations of the orifice give rise to many afl'ections of both the urethra and

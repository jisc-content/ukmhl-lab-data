53 OF OVAllIAN DISEASE. arrived at. Indeed an accurate diagnosis is exceeding- ly difficult, if not impossible. Innumerable mistakes have been made, which have led to most unjustifiable proceedings. In one case, the abdomen was, after two or three dry tappings, opened by an incision from the ensiform cartilage to the pubes ; the viscera were turned over and over, but no tumour could be dis- covered. The woman was sewed up, and did not die. The following was a still more complete failure in diagnosis. In a case of large tumour of the belly, many persons accustomed to manipulate abdominal swellings considered that extrauterine conception had taken place ; and that the child had come to matu- rity and perished. The history of the case counte- nanced the supposition; the symptoms had been such as indicate impregnation. The woman, to avoid ex- posure, went to a distance to be relieved of her bur- den, which was becoming more and more bulky. The usual period passed over. It was thought that the head and thorax of an infant could then be felt readily through the parietes, and perhaps some one might have been found heroic enough to have divided them and explored the tumour. The young woman, however, was in the last stage of phthisis, and soon died. A wonderfully tuberculated omentum filled the peritoneal cavity; the uterus and its appendages were quite healthy. Operation has also been pro- posed, when, on dissection, the liver was found to compose the abdominal swelling. Such cases, a long list of which might be given, render the prudent surgeon very cautious in his diag- nosis of abdominal tumours, and chary of operative

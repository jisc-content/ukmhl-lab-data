DISUNITED FRACTUllE. 311 seven, or eight weeks, according to the age, and as the consolidation advances, the patient may be allow- ed to move about on crutches, some few days after removal of the apparatus, the foot and leg being still bandaged. No weight should be put'on the limb for several weeks after, otherwise a leg cured well and straightly may become bent, twisted, and deformed.

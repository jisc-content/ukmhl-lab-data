14 OF HERNIA. nimes are also applied, according to the situation of the protrusion. The inguinal and crural forms of hernia being the most common, will chiefly occupy our attention. The inguinal is divided into true or oblique inguinal^ and into direct or ventro-inguinal. In the oblique, the protrusion passes along the inguinal canal. This course is in young persons short, but as the muscles become developed it is lengthened to about two inches, reckoning from the external ring to the fun- nel-like opening through the transverse fascia. The appearance of the swelling in this canal leads to diag- nosis betwixt the oblique and direct hernia; but in chronic cases, this distinction is often in a great mea- sure done away with. In large and old oblique rup- tures the neck of the tumour is shortened, and the openings of the canal are approximated and more in a direct line. They are also immensely dilated, being often enlarged to such an extent as to admit all the fingers of the hand, when placed in a conical form,â€” and this even in the living body, the loose integument receding along with the tumour. The epigastric artery is situated behind the neck, and on its inner side. It is much displaced inwards in cases of old standing. The direct hernia passes through the parietes oppo- site to the external ring, and does not come in con- tact with the spermatic chord until it has reached that point. Its neck is short, and the epigastric artery is on its outer side. The coverings of the two tumours are different. Those of the oblique are such as the chord possesses, a prolongation of the transverse fascia, a covering from the creniaster muscle, fibres

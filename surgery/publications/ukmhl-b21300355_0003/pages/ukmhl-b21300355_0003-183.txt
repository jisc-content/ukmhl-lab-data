171 SARCOCELE. therefore to be enquired into in the first instance, and if stricture, or irritability independent of con- traction, be discovered, the practice must be directed towards it. The urethra being sound, counter irri- tation is to be apphed to the testicle ; and the part sliould be suspended, though not in function alto- gether ; walking exercise, and the friction which it occasions, must be avoided as much as possible. A gum and mercurial plaster protects the part, and in- duces a moderate irritation of the surface usually suf- ficient to dissipate the swelling slowly ; if ineffectual, either repeated blistering, or the insertion of a seton in the integuments, may be had recourse toâ€”from either or both much benefit is often derived. In obstinate cases the recumbent posture must be en- joined. In general, slight enlargement and indura- tion of the epididymis remains. The scrophulous swelling does not often yield to the means for discussion, but advances to suppura- tion. The abscess is to be opened, and the unhealthy contents discharged; endeavours are then to be made to effect closure by granulation, and after that counter irritation may dissipate the tumour, or at least dimi- nish its size. If protrusion occur, as generally hap- pens, it may be cut away; and by then keeping the granulations on a level with the integument, either by pressure or escharotics, at the same time attend- ing to improvement of the general health, cicatrisa- tion may be procured, though tedious. Or escharo- tics may be used from the first, instead of the knife. For example, powdering the fungous surface occa-

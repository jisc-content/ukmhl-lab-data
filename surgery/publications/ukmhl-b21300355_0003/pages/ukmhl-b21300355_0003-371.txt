If oedema remain, bandaging or a laced support will be required. Amputation.

But there are cases in which mutilation, though a harsh remedy, is still indispensable for the saving of life. There are others in which it is prudent and proper to resort to operation, in consequence of a member being perfectly useless, and likely to impair the usefulness of the individual.

Opiates are of great use in alleviating the pains and twitchings in the limb.

Sup- port and gentle pressure are indispensable soon after evacuation of the matter, when no fresh collection is threatened. The injury is often so great as at once to demand removal of the limb. There is no alternative, when, from laceration of the soft parts, superficial, deep, or both—comminution of the bone to a great extent— rupture of large vessels—and opening of joints— either gangrene or an overpowering suppuration are rendered not only probable but almost certain. The period at which the operation is to be undertaken re- quires judicious selection. Some patients are not affect- ed constitutionally even by great and violent injury, such as dreadful laceration of the limbs; whilst others, even after slight wounds, are affected with delirium, tremors, vomiting, lowness of spirits, depressed cir- culation, paleness of the surface, and appear on the eve either of rapid sinking or of immediate dissolu- tion. In the first class of patients immediate ampu- tation may be had recourse to with safety and advan- tage.

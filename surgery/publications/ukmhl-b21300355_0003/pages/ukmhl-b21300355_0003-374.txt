"AMPUTATION. 362 \ limb is produced, and the quantity of blood that must be lost is increased. For a similar reason, pres- sure, sufficiently firm to stop arterial haemorrhage, is to be continued till the principal branches are tied, and then entirely removed ; for the continuance of even slight pressure will increase the flow from the surface of the stump—blood, flowing in, and being arrested in its venous return, trickles out through the open ends of the veins. If a circular band be used for the compression, such as the screw tourni- quet, it should be put on quickly, and screwed up at once, and then the incisions should not be delayed one instant after; there should be no relaxation of the pressure at any part of the operation; and as soon as the principal vessels have been secured, the apparatus should be altogether removed—otherwise,' as already stated, rapid oozing will continue from the face of the stump. It is my confirmed opinion, that much more blood is lost from the use of a tour- niquet than without it. I would rather trust to a no very efficient assistant, than put on a tourniquet. It is evident, that compression on the whole circum- ference of a limb must completely interrupt venous return, and cause the increase of haemorrhage already mentioned ; whereas pressure on only two points of the same circumference, as is effected by the hand of an assistant, is not liable to this objection. Besides, the latter mode is more quickly applied, and more quickly removed, causes infinitely less pain to the patient, and is equally eff'ectual in arresting the flow in the main arterial trunk. The incisions should

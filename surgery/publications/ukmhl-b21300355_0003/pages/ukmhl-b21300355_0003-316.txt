FRACTURE OF THE PATELLA. 304 the upper portion is acted on by the muscles on the fore part of the thigh, to a greater or less degree, in almost any position ; there is increase and vitiation of the synovial secretion, and when the bones are approximated, this fluid is interposed. The union is therefore almost uniformly ligamentous, and, fortu- nately, this is as strong and as rapidly effected as that by bone. When the treatment is not of the most approved kind, a long portion of ligament is pro- duced, and the limb remains weak. But union by a short ligament is undoubtedly the most desirable result, the member is as useful as when bone is the uniting medium, and ligament is less subject to dis- ruption ; bony union is, for a long time, apt to give way on the application of even slight force. The fragments are to be approximated, and brought nearly into contact, by placing the limb, with the knee extended, and the thigh slightly bent on the pelvis. The limb is retained in this position by the applica- tion of a straight splint behind, hollowed at the ex- tremities, extending from a little below the tuber- osity of the ischium to below the middle of the leg, and retained by a roller, not at all tight; the foot and lower part of the limb must be previously ban- daged to prevent infiltration. All apparatus with straps, buckles, and apertures to receive the portions of the bone, are worse than useless. The splint re- quires to be worn for some time after the patient gets into the erect position, which ought not to before six weeks after the accident. 1

When the vertebrae are affected, absolute rest must be enjoined and enforced; and a drain is to be established by the sides of the spinous processes, either by moxa, potass, or setonâ€”it is immaterial which. The dis- charge is kept up by occasionally dressing the issue for a few hours with an acrid ointment, so as to re- produce a slough.

The opening of the cavity, and again shutting it up, however carefully conduct- ed, is in almost every instance followed by alarming and hazardous results. Rapid accumulation of putrid and bloody matter takes place, and air is extricated within the cavity ; the vessels of the cyst, being un- supported, part with their contents ; irritative fever is lighted up, with rapid pulse, anxious countenance, and delirium.

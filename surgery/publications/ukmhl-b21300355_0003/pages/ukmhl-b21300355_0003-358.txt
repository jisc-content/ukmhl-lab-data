LUXATION OF THE ANKLE. 346 with a single instance of it. I have never seen tbis accident. The bone, it is said, may be displaced outwards, inwards, or upwards. The first form of hixation is the most frequent, and is caused by a severe fall with the foot twisted outwards and the knee inwards. Displacement inwards is produced by direct violence applied to the outer part of the bone, or by the foot being turned inwards in a fall. Dis- placement upwards can occur only after laceration of the ligamentum patellae, the bone being then drawn up by the unresisted action of the muscles on the fore part of the thigh. In dislocation outwards, the bone has been found " resting with its inner edge upon the outer surface of the condyle, the fore part facing obliquely forwards and inwards." In this last form of accident, sudden, forcible, and complete flexion of the limb is said to produce immediate reduction. In dislocation outwards or inwards, the muscles are to be relaxed by raising the heel, extending the limb, flexing the thigh, and then forcing the bone to its proper site by manipulation. In the dislocation upwards with rupture, the limb is to be kept extend- ed and raised, and the bone is brought as nearly into its place as possible by bandaging. "^Vlien a peculi^-r laxity of the apparatus about the joint exists, whether as a cause of luxation or not, the sujDjDort of a well- made knee-cap is required. As formerly stated, dislocation of the Ankle cannot take place inwards or outwards, without fracture of the end of the tibia or of the fibula, either above the articulation, or where they project by the sides of the

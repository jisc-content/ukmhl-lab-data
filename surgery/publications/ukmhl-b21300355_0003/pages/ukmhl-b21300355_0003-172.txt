160 HYDROCELE. sing no pain, but proving inconvenient simply from its bulk and situation ; fluctuating, and sometimes partially diaphanous ; evidently circumscribed, the chord both above and below being natural to both sight and touch ; not altered by change of posture or by muscular exertion. Sometimes it encroaches both on the groin and on the testicle, but even then atten- tive manipulation readily distinguishes it from swell- ings connected with these parts. Discharge of the fluid by means of a small trocar and canula, not only dissipates the swelling, but often effects a permanent cure, particularly in young persons—the cyst either ceasing to exercise a secretory function, or becoming obliterated. If re-accumulation take place, the treat- ment is to be conducted on the same principles as in hydrocele of the vaginal coat. Hydrocele of the tunica vaginalis is exceedingly common, particularly amongst labouring people, and occurs apparently with equal frequency at all ages. It is a gradual accumulation within the tunica vagi- nalis of a fluid partaking more or less of the serous character, furnished by the exhalants of that mem- brane and of the tunica albuginea,—but whether from excessive secretion or deficient absorption, it is diffi- cult to determine. It is probable that the accumula- tion is the result of excited action in the part, for its origin is most frequently attributable to external in- jury—blows or bruises, followed by rapid swelling, which, after a time, subsides, leaving perhaps some enlargement of the testicle, or of the more superficial tissues, and succeeded by the gradual appearance of

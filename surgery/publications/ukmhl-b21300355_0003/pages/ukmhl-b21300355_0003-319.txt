FRACTURE OF THF. LEG. 307 or the sharp fractured end of the bone has been thrust through. Sometimes the bone is protruded to a con- siderable extent, and entangled amongst the more superficial soft parts. Fractures of the lower portions of the bones are generally the consequence of twisting and partial dis- placement of the ankle. The fibula is most frequently broken by twisting of the foot outwards, and the fracture is almost uniformly between two and three inches above the articulation. The broken ends are displaced inwards upon the tibia. The injury is detected by moving the foot, and tracing the line of bone ; after swelling has taken place, examination, though almost equally easy, is productive of much more pain, and it is of importance to ascertain the nature of the injury at once, and immediately after the accident. The outer malleolus sometimes gives way from the same cause ; or it may be snapped off by a direct blow. The lower portion of the tibia is sometimes longitudinally split by bending inwards of the foot, the patient having fallen from a consi- derable height; occasionally the inner malleolus is broken transversely. Enquiry as to how the acci- dent happened, particularly as to the direction of the twist, the displacement of the foot, and the degree and extent of crepitation, will determine the nature .of the injury. The astragulus, os calcis, the other bones of the tarsus, and those of the metatarsus, are sometimes broken by the application of great force, but they

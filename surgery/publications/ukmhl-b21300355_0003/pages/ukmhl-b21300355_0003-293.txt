FRACTUllE 01' THE HUMERUS. 281 being left, so that when the swelling subsides, they may neither meet, and consequently lie loose, nor overlap each other. They are softened by steeping in hot water, so that they may embrace every part of the limb to which they are applied ; and the extre- mities should be rounded off, to prevent galling of the parts. They are padded with soft flannel or lint, or, what is better, with finely carded tow, and retained by a circular roller applied from the points of the fingers up to the shoulder. The binding should proceed from below upwards, to avoid swelling from obstruct- ed cH'culation, and do away with the necessity of removing the apparatus arising from this cause. It is well to place a wooden sj)lint on the outside, re- tained by an additional bandage, so as to steady the parts till the pasteboard has dried, and formed a firm mould or case for the limb ; then the wood is unne- cessary, and should be removed. The forearm is bent at right angles, and the humerus fixed to the trunk. In simple fracture, there is in general no ne- cessity for interfering with, the apparatus until the bandage slackens, in consequence of the swelling sub- siding ; then, usually at the end of eight days, it is to be reapplied. One splint is carefully raised, whilst the other is kept fixed and the parts steadied, and the limb is ascertained to be straight and of a proper length; if not, then, or even later, the position of the bones may be rectified without causing much un- easiness. A simple fracture need not confine the pa- tient to bed ; he may walk about with the arm sup- ported in a sling.

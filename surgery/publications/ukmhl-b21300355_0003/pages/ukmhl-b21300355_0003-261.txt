FRACTURES. 249 and violent inflammatory action occur, the pain be- comes excruciating, fever and delirium follow ; there is an imminent risk of gangrene, and extensive sup- puration among the muscles is almost inevitable. If the patient recover, the union is bad, and the limb deformed. A fracture is said to be simple, when there is no wound of the superim.posed integuments. The exter- nal parts may be bruised, or the deep structure much injured, with laceration of the vessels arid rapid and great swelling ; or there may be little or no injury of the soft parts. Great danger may exist without divi- sion of the integuments ; these, yielding under the force, may remain entire, whilst by great and direct violence the bone is comminuted, the muscles broken up, vessels and nerves torn,â€”the limb is infiltrated with blood, and must become gangrenous as soon as reaction takes place. But usually these untoward circumstances do not exist in simple fracture, the soft parts being but slightly injured. Fracture is compound when the integuments are divided by the external force, so as to expose the bro- ken bone. But the wound may not penetrate to the bone ; and then the accident is termed fracture with wound, not compound fracture. The soft parts are often divided by the sharp end of the bone ; this is frequently the case in oblique fracture, occasioned by a fall from a height, the lower fractured extremity being pushed forcibly upwards. The muscles are usually much injured. The wound is either large or small, lacerated or clean. Fracture, simple or compound, is comminuted v/lnen

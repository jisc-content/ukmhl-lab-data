CANCEE OF PENIS. 155 membrane of the prepuce. As before observed, it is most frequently met with in those who have laboured under congenital phymosis; in that state of the organ, its extremity is apt to inflame, swell, and ulcerate, in consequence of accumulation and acrimony of the secretions from the membrane of the prepuce: indolent swellings form in the groin; and in one case, I recollect, these assumed a malig- nant action, a frightful ulcer formed, and the patient was destroyed, after division of the prepuce, and after the ulceration on it had been long healed, and the part had apparently become quite sound. Early removal of the diseased part, by incision wide of the indurated and altered structure surrounding the ulcer, is the only means of saving the patient, of pre- venting glandular inguinal tumour, ulceration of it, haemorrhage, hectic, and death. When the prepuce solely is involved, removal of it is sufficient, either entirely or in part, as circumstances may demand. When the glans and coverings, as also the body of the penis, are involved, amputation is to be perform- ed, provided the lymphatics still appear unaffected. In this operation the integuments must be freely re- moved, otherwise the cut orifice of the urethra will be obstructed by their puckering and contraction during cicatrisation of the wound. With this view, the skin is drawn forwards and stretched by the left hand, and then with one sweep of a long knife a transverse incision is made at once through all the parts composing the organ. Two or three vessels by the side of the septum may require ligatures. The

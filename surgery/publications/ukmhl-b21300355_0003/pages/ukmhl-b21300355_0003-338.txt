326 LUXATION OF THE SHOULDER-JOINT. or holding a sheet or towel passed round the body, close to the axilla, M'hilst the surgeon extends and rotates the extremity, and at the same time lifts the head of the bone from its situation. The rotation is made by using the forearm, bent to a right angle, as a lever ; thus considerable power can be exerted on the head of the bone, and the long head of the biceps muscle —the stretching of which, no doubt, affords an ob- stacle to reduction—is at the same time relaxed. In luxation downwards, there is no more successful me- thod than that by counter-extension with the heel in the axilla, and extension by the surgeon grasping the wrist. The patient is placed recumbent, on a couch or on the floor, and the surgeon, sitting by his side, lodges his heel in the axilla, and with both hands extends the arm ; after a short continuance of exten- sion, he performs a sudden and pow^erful combination of both movements, and so jerks the bone into its natural position. In some recent, and in all old cases, it is necessary to apply considerable force, steadily, and for a long time, so as to tire out the muscles, and dislodge the head of the bone. An assistant effects this by means of pullies. These are fixed to a laque, applied above the elbow with a clove-hitch, and to a ring fastened either in the wall or to a post; two small iron rings which can be screwed into a beam are useful in private practice, and should always accompany the pulleys. When all is prepared the assistant pulls the end of the rope steadily, and with considerable power, whilst the surgeon rotates the limb, and endeavours to lift the head of the bone, at the same time regulating the degree of extension.

318 LUXATION OF THE LOWER JAW. ticiilarly if the dislocation be of long standing. When thus general exhaustion has been procured, counter- extension and extension are to be had recourse to. The former consists in having the patient, and the bone next to the trunk, fixed immovably by fitting laques and belts; and the latter is made by one or more assistants, or, if need be, with the help of pul- leys. During extension, advantage is in many cases gained by lateral force and by rotation of the limb, the bone being thereby moved from its position, and brought within the sphere of muscular action, by which it is drawn suddenly into its proper place. In some cases, there is no doubt but considerable lacera- tion is occasioned by the efforts at reduction, and perhaps this is in some degree necessary to a success- ful issueâ€”as when the capsule has been slightly lace- rated by the accident, and in consequence interposes an obstacle to the head of the bone slipping into its socket. After reduction, inflammatory action in the articulation and its neighbourhood is to be expected, to a greater or less degree, particularly when much force has been employed, and means must be taken to avert it; local are generally sufficient, along with perfect rest. In luxation of the loiver Jaw, both articulating ends are most frequently dislodged. They can escape in but one direction, forwards into the temporal fossa ; when both are dislodged, the mouth is widely open, and fixedly so, the chin is drawn downwards and backwards. When one is displaced, the jaws are

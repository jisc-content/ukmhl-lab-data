CALCULUS YESICyE. 187 m-atinff durins: the introduction of the instrument; and the operator was dissuaded from his intention. The patient did not live many weeks; a small ulcer- ated cavity was found in the situation of the veru- montanum, but no stone. By a dexterous use of the sound the size of the foreign body can be tolerably well judged of, as well as the state of its surface, and it may also be known whether there are more stones than one. The bent part of the instrument is passed over and beyond the calculus, and then under it, so as to ascertain its thickness ; and by moving it on each side, the other dimensions are also arrived at. No information can be obtained as to the size of the stone—at least in adults, and when it is not encysted—from any exa- mination by the rectum. Concretions resembling horse beans in size, and even larger, can be brought through the adult ure- thra without incision, by means of properly con- structed forceps. The facility with which this is accomplished will depend much on the state of the passage, whether naturally capacious and free from morbid contraction or not, and also upon the condi- tion of the prostate gland. Notwithstanding the greater irritability of the parts in young persons, this operation may be readily performed on them ; on several occasions I have removed from children concretions of considerable size through the natural passage. Various contrivances have been used for the purpose. Modifications of what are called Hun- ter's forceps have been recommended,—two elastic

True stricture is the result of inflammatory action in the part; at first serous effusion takes place beneath the membrane, and elevates it into an cedematous swell- ing, which, according to its extent, obstructs the canal; then lymph is deposited both beneath the membrane and external to it, becomes organised, and forms a permanent and more unyielding obstruc- tion. Strictures are of various kinds. The bridle stricture is rarely met with ; a membranous band of organised lymph traverses the canal, and, according to the thick- ness of this membrane, the flow of urine is more or less impeded; in the majority of cases the morbid forma- tion is thin and delicate, but still sufficient to scatter and diminish the stream. When a soft bougie is introduced, it is resisted by the stricture, and on ex- amining the instrument when withdrawn, the trans- verse and central impression on its point marks the

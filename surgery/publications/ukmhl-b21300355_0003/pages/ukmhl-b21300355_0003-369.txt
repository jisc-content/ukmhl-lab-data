357 BRUISE. bruising of the soft Bruise is most frequently pro- duced by a blow, and is most severe when the violence is resisted by an unyielding part, as by bone; a squeeze between two bodies, particularly if they be in motion, also inflicts extensive contusion. The swell- ing continues to increase for some time, and then gradually disappears along with the pain. As the tumour subsides, the discoloration increases; the thinner parts of the effusion have been absorbed, and the clot then shines through the skin, imparting to it various hues. Bruise may be followed by inflammatory action. Then effusion is increased, bloody fluid is poured both into the cavity and into the unbroken cellular tissue, the whole parts become extremely tender, the surface inflames, and the excited action is apt to terminate unfavourably in the various tissues. Not unfrequent- ly sloughing takes place, both of the skin and of the cellular tissue and fatty matter, with unhealthy sup- puration and infiltration ; and constitutional disturb- ance accompanies. All this is likely, nay, certain, to follow admission of air into the cavity filled with effused blood, whether by accidental wound or by intentional division of the integument. Meddlesome surgery is unfortunate here, as well as in many other cases. After scarifications, punctures, leechings, or incisions, the blood often seems to undergo a putre- factive process, and unhealthy suppuration is quickly established. Sometimes the clot is not entirely absorbed, and considerable swelling remains for a long time, perhaps with slight tenderness of the part; and foundation is

SPRAIN. 348 sometimes pushed out of its place ; though it is dif- ficult to conceive how, to a bone so hid and so firmly- connected, such force should be applied as to cause protrusion of it from its natural situation. It has been found lying on the dorsum of the foot, causing swelling, lameness, great pain, shortening and defor- mity of the limb; and the shape of the bone can, in such circumstances, be distinctly felt through the integument. As already observed, reduction is almost impracticable, and, with the view of remedying de- formity, it has been proposed to cut out the displaced bone ; but as to the expediency of such practice I can give no opinion. I have seen but one instance of displacement of this bone backwards, and most probably another will never occur to me. A heavy young man, in a state of utter intoxication, fell backwards down a stair, and in the fall his foot became entangled in the railing. The astragulus was found lying betwixt the back of the tibia and the tendo Achillis, its upper articulating surface facing forwards, the lower in contact with the tendon. All attempts to reduce the bone proved fruitless. Violent inflammatory action followed, but was reduced by active measures ; and the limb ulti- mately became very useful; in fact, though not till after many months, little lameness or shortening was perceptible. By Sprain is understood subluxation or partial displacement of a joint, with stretching, and more or less laceration of the articulating apparatusâ€”liga- ments, tendons, sheaths, and bursa?, being all involved

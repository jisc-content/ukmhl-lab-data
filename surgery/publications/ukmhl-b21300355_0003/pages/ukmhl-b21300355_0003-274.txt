262 FRACTUllE OF THE SPINE. they will keep up the discharge and tend to prevent union. From three to six weeks is generally suffi- cient time for consolidation of the fracture. In severe cases union may be prevented by necrosis of part of the bone; or, though the bone unite, the external wounds may not heal, and the discharge may con- tinue till the dead portions separate and are dis- charged. Fracture of the Sjnnal Column is attended with alarming symptoms, and often terminates fatally, from the pernicious effects necessarily produced on the spinal chord, either immediately or consecutively, when the bones forming the column are disjoined to any great extent. The injury is effected by great violence—by the body being projected and alighting awkwardly—by a fall on the breech from a height, the head and trunk being bent forcibly forwards— by direct blows on the spine. Displacement of the bones forming the spine sel- dom takes place without fracture to a greater or less extent. Pure dislocation of the spine, from the rup- ture of ligaments and fibro-cartilage, is a very rare accident; few cases of it are on record, and in them the injury was in the cervical region ; I have only met with one instance of complete and pure disloca- tion. The ligaments are of great strength, and the bones yield sooner than they; and in the greater number of severe injuries of joints this is the case more or less. Either the bodies or the processes of the vertebras are broken, and sometimes comminuted; occasion-

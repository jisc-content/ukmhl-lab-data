llETENTION OF URINE. 136 on into the bladder. Thus, even in the worst cases, the natural canal is at once established. In every- instance of difficulty and complication, the catheter, however passed, should be retained for two or more days. The above is the only admissible mode of puncturing by the perineum. It has been proposed, and practised on the continent, to reach the bladder from the perineum either by incisions or by the ran- dom thrust of a long trocar ; the latter mode is un- scientific, the former is unnecessarily painful, serious, and difficult; both are dangerous, and to be avoided. The symptoms of extravasation of urine have been already detailed. The practice must be bold, and adopted without hesitation or delay. No bulging or fluctuation in the perineum is to be waited for. Ex- travasation can never be mistaken or overlooked by a man of any experience, and who is endowed with common observation. The effect and extent of the perineal fascia must be borne in mind ; it diminishes or precludes—when the point at which the urethra has given way is interior to it—external appearance of the mischief, and by confining the deleterious fluid increases the infiltration internally. A free and deep incision holds out the only chance of relief; punctures or trifling scratches are worse than useless ; neither is there any need of passing bougies or catheters, or of puncturing the bladder. The following appears to me an instructive case, and may be briefly detailed in ierrorem. A man applied for relief, with a large swelling in the hypo-

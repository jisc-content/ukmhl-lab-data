87 TREATMENT. ty ; contraction attends the cicatrisation, and so fur- ther protrusion is prevented. By the speculum aui assisting the eye and finger, the nature and position of foreign bodies in the rec- tum are ascertained, and their removal facilitated. They are to be extracted by the finger, by a scoop, or by forceps. It has been proposed by cut into the colon from behind, so as to open that part of the bowel unconnected with the peritoneum, when it is distinctly ascertained that alvine concretions lodge there. This may be put in practice when the case is clear and the symptoms urgent, but, as already observed, such foreign bodies are now very rarely met with. In imperforate anus, when the bowel terminates high, it has been proposed to cut through the abdo- minal parietes, and open the sigmoid flexure, so as to establish an artificial anus. The proceeding is un- warrantable, both in congenital deficiency and in ma- lignant disease of the bowel. There is no doubt a possibility of life being thus prolonged, but it is by no means probable, and scarcely desirable. In the more common cases, the bowel is opened, and the meconium evacuated, by a slight and safe incision in the site of the anus. Even through a considerable depth of soft parts the impulse of the fluid in the bowel is distinctly felt during exertion of the abdo- minal muscles. If incision through the integuments and cellular tissue prove insufficient, a sharp-pointed bistoury is pushed onwards in the direction of the bowel, under the guidance of the forefinger of the

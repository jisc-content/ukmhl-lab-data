LUXATION OF THE SHOULDEll-JOlNT. .'}23 cannot existâ€”the articulating surfaces cannot be separated, nor can the head of the humerus be altered in position ; subluxation, or, in other words, a sprain, may occur in such circumstances, but true luxation cannot. Bruises of the shoulder, with or without fracture, either of the scapula or of the upper part of the humerus, must not be mistaken for dislocation, for the consequences of such a blunder are fearful. In both descriptions of accident, the appearances of the limb are somewhat similar, and hence the examina- tion requires to be particularly accurate and careful. In both there is flattening of the shoulder, but in fracture there is crepitus, motion to an unnatural extent, though painful, and greater suffering during manipulation ; in dislocation no crepitus at all resem- bling that in fracture can be perceived, the motions of the limb are very limited, and the displaced head of the bone can almost always be felt. The direction of the force too, as already observed when on the subject of fracture, is an important assistant in diag- nosis ; from falls or blows upon the shoulder we may expect fracture, from falls on the elbow or palm, luxa- tion. In dislocation an indistinct feeling, sometimes amounting to obscure crepitation, is occasionally perceived during rotation of the limb ; and this arises from one or more of the tendinous attachments of the muscles having, during their disruption, torn away a portion of their osseous attachment. Great pain attends on dislocated humerus, from the head of the bone compressing and stretching the axillary plexus; and the interruption to the flow of

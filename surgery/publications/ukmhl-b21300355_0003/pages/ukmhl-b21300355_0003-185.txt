173 CASTRATION. merit are thickened and hard. The progress of this tumour is slower than that of the medullary, but equally certain. The cystic sarcomata, when fibrous, may remain long apparently in an indolent state, and without affection of the lymphatics ; but when soft, the cystic contents are often bloody, the medullary matter soon breaks down, and then the integuments yield, and the malignant advance is rapid. It need scarcely be observed, that in such cases nothing but the knife, used at an early period, when the tumour is yet latent and the lymphatics uninvolved, can save the patient. Castration must be performed; and even this is in too many cases insufficient to annul the malignant disposition of which the parts have become the seat. As already stated, it must be had recourse to before hard and knotted swelling in the groin, with thickening and induration of the chord, has commenced, otherwise it can be of no avail. The patient is placed recumbent. An incision is commenced a little above the inguinal aperture, and carried downwards ; on reaching the tumour it is inclined to one side, so that with a similar one on the opposite side an elliptical portion of integument may be included. One straight incision might be suffi- cient for removal of the tumour : but in most cases it is necessary to take away more or less skin, that a large, loose, and flabby bag may not remain after the extirpation. This preliminary wound penetrates only through the skin and cellular tissue, and should be made rapidly. At its upper part the chord is then to be cut down upon, exposed, and divided ; but the

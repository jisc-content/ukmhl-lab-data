The wound is made through loose cellular tissue ; urinary extravasation into that tissue is apt to occur, and proves fatal. If the bowels are inflamed, or evince a tendency to- ■wards inflammatory action, the danger is increased, for a formidable wound is made in the immediate vi- cinity of the bowels.

IIETENTION OF UlllNE. 135 the bladder must be relieved at all hazards; and if the prostate be sound, puncture by the rectum may- be performed. This is neither a difficult nor a dan- gerous operation, else it would not be so often resort- ed to ; it does not require so much skill and manage- ment as does the passing of a catheter. Neither is it painful to the patient; the parts to be perforated are thin, there is scarcely any effusion of blood, and all is done in the dark. But it is an operation which should never be thought of, unless as a last and des- perate remedy; it is one in which I have had no personal experience, though I have seen it done re- peatedly. The procedure gives temporary relief, but then the urethra still remains to be put into a proper condition ; a man cannot always void his urine and excrement through one common cloaca. If the ure- thra be cleared, the recto-vesical aperture may soon close. After the bladder is relieved, the urethra may become quieter, and admit of an instrument being passed; but it is of very great consequence to effect the introduction of a catheter at the first. Rather than puncture the bladder, the stricture should be cut down upon, and an opening made into the dilated part of the urethra behind the stricture. A firm silver catheter is passed down to the stric- ture, and retained there by an assistant; an incision in the line of the central raphe—supposing the con- stricted part to be in the perineal region—is made over the extremity of the instrument, the contracted part of the urethra is divided, and the catheter passed

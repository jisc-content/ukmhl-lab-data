LUXATION OF THE CARPUS. SS5 each other are broken up, and their extremities sepa- rated to an unnatural distance. The accident is dis- tinctly marked by the deformity, the absence of hard projection, and by the unusual space between the radius and ulna occupied by a soft and yielding swell- ing. Replacement is accomplished much in the same manner as in complete luxation, the bones being com- pressed towards each other with one hand, whilst extension is made with the other; afterwards splints must be applied and retained. Compound luxations of the wrist are occasionally met with, and like compound fractures in this situa- tion, are always troublesome, and often terminate unfavourably. The soft parts are sparing, possessed of little vitality, and much injured by the accident; consequently reparation proceeds very slowly, and is generally superseded by unhealthy and profuse sup- puration, perhaps accompanied with more or Jess sloughing of tendons and integument. If the ends of the bones protrude bare, shattered, and split, they should be removed by means of either the saw or the cutting pliers, previously to attempts at reduction ; the wound should then be approximated, and the cure conducted on ordinary principles. Sometimes a single bone of the Carpus is displaced, usually backwards. It is quite loose and movable, and is easily replaced, but in almost every case redis- placement occurs, the bone at one time occupying its proper situation, at others forming an inconvenient and unseemly prominence on the back of the wrist, diminished by extension, and increased by flexion of

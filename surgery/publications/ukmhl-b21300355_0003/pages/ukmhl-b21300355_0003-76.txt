At length all traces of venous structure disappear ; the tumour seems to consist chiefly of effused lymph, condensed cellular tissue, and coagula. In not a few instances, however, the contents of the veins remain partially fluid, and a communica- tion exists between the vessels of the tumour and those of the surrounding parts. That such is the usual structure of piles, I am convinced from repeated and careful dissection of the tumours. The neighbouring parts often swell and inflame. Sometimes one or two tumours exist; or they occur in numbers, clustered together, and form a large irregular mass, inflamed and often ulcerated. Acute pain is experienced in the part, when touched and after straining at stool; by straining too, such as are attached within the sphincter are jjushed out, and if allowed to remain, are constricted l)y the sphincter, swell in consequence, ulcerate or slough, and discharge blood.

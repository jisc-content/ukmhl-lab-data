174 CASTRATION. division should not be made until the chord has been isolated for some distance, so as to afford a firm hold to an assistant, and not before the assistant has secured it firmly in his fingers, otherwise it may retract within the inguinal canal, rendering the bleeding from the spermatic artery troublesome. The dissection is now to be continued downwards, rapidly, and yet cautiously; the tumour is detached on all sides, and removed along with a sufficient quantity of integument. In dissecting off its pos- terior surface, care must be taken not to wound the septum of the tunica vaginalis. All adherent skin must be taken away, and in the case of fungus, the incision of the integument must be wide of the pro- jecting part. But, at the same time, unnecessarily extensive removal of skin is always to be avoided, otherwise there will sometimes be a difficulty in cover- ing the root of the penis and the remaining testicle. The assistant has, during the extirpation, retained his firm grasp of the chord, so restraining haemor- rhage from that quarter ; now the branches, generally two, of the spermatic artery are pulled out by the forceps, and a ligature applied to their extremities, in- closure of any of the surrounding parts being studi- ously avoided. To tie veins, artery, nerves, vas de- ferens, and cellular tissue, in one mass, would lead to most serious mischief, not to mention the inmiediate and excruciating pain occasioned. It has been re- commended either to pass a temporary ligature round the chord, before its division, to prevent re- traction, or to tie the artery before it is cut across.

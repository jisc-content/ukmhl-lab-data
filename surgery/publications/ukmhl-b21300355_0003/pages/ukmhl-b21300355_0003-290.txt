INJURIES OF THE SHOULDER. 278 when fracture is treated as luxation. The force ap- plied with the view of reduction is in all circumstances very painful, but, when exerted on a fractured bone, must prove absolute torture; and during the whole treatment, the fragments are every now and then torn separate, and union so prevented. Severe in- flammatory action follows the reductive violence, and is kept alive or regenerated by the loose and pro- jecting fractured ends of the bone; extensive sup- purations, attended with fever, ensue, and may de- stroy the patient. Undetected fracture may also be treated as a bruise of the soft parts only ; then every motion of the body and limb is productive of excru- ciating pain, and there is much risk of uncontrollable inflammation being excited—all which would have been warded off, by placing the bones in a proper and steady position ; the adaptation of a pad in the axilla is followed by immediate and great relief. Such mistakes are quite inexcusable. By one care- ful examination,—productive of considerable unea- siness to the patient in some conditions of the parts —the real state of matters should be ascertained ; and then the practice founded on the knowledge so obtained will be followed with speedy cessation, or at least great diminution of pain, and with every pro- bability of restoring the limb to strength and use- fulness. Fractures of the glenoid cavity, of the neck of the scapula, and of the neck of the humerus, are all treated by the same simple, though effectual, appa- ratus as employed for injuries of the clavicle.

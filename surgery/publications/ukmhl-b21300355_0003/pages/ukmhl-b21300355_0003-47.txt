OF HERNIA. 35 size and duration of the tiiinour. The division of these layers must necessarily be conducted with great care and caution. At length the sac is exposed. This is opened by pinching up a portion betwixt the nails of the thumb and forefinger, and then cut- ting with the blade of the knife laid horizontally. On wounding the sac, there is usually evacuated a small quantity of brownish serous fluid. The probe- pointed bistoury is then taken up, and insinuated in- to the opening; and by this instrument, guided on the forefinger of the left hand, the sac and its cover- ings are divided up to near the ring, and down to near the bottom of the tumour. The hernial con- tents are thus exposed. These are unravelled, and ex- amined attentively ; if only brownish red, from accu- mulation of the venous blood, of unbroken surface and unadherent, they are fit to be reduced. The stricture is felt for with the forefinger of the left hand, and into it either the point of the finger or the nail is gently insinuated. The protruded parts, if voluminous, are held down by an assistant, and along the fore- part of the finger is passed a probe-pointed, narrow, and slightly curved knife. In carrying this upwards, the blade is placed flat with the finger, and its point, and no more, is passed through the contracted part; its edge is then turned forwards, its back resting on the finger, and by raising the handle gently, a slight incision is made into the more resisting fibres, in the direction of the mesial line. The instrument is with- drawn with the same caution as in its introduction. The finger now enters easily, and by raising it gently and repeatedly, the parts are dilated. It is then

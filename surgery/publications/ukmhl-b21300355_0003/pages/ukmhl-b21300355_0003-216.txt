204 CALCULUS VESICA. the same direction and to the same extent as that on the left. Thus a triangular flap is formed, the apex towards the membranous portion of the urethra, and through the opening thereby afforded any stone which will pass through the bones of the pelvis can be extracted without much difficulty. But no benefit can result from cutting both sides of the prostate, either by the double lithotome or in the manner just detailed, in all cases. It is time enough to incise the opposite side when, by introduction of the finger through the usual wound, it has been ascertained that the stone is too large to pass through. Then it is safer to cut the other side, than to enlarge the original opening, either by the knife, or by laceration in cruel attempts to extract the stone through an insufficient opening. When the stones are small, the scoop is the pre- ferable instrument. By it the bladder may be soon cleared, even when the concretions are numerous. It is introduced along with the finger, is brought in contact with the foreign body, and passed beyond it or beneath it. Then the point of the finger is placed on the lower part of the stone, so as to steady and secure it, and the scoop and finger retaining this re- lation are gradually withdrawn along with the stone. More than one, perhaps, may be removed at each withdrawal of the instrument. The flat and slightly bent lever, usually forming the handle of the scoop, is useful should the forceps unfortunately slip during extraction, leaving the calculus impacted in the wound ; by insinuating it behind the stone, and em-

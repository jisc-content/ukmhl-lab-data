OF OVAllIAN DISEASE. 55 portion of the profession, that the repetition of any- such incisions and gropings would be unpardonable.— 1. On account of the difficulty, nay, impossibility, of forming a correct diagnosis; of ascertaining with cer- tainty what organ is involved ; of ascertaining the structure and disposition of the tumour, if any, and to what parts it is adherent. 2.

There is a strong probability of the lym- phatic system being involved, even at a very early period, and then the extirpation of the tumour—sup- posing the mass to be so situated as to admit of re- moval without difficulty or danger—cannot be at- tended with any advantage ; and in every point of view interference is unadvisable. 4. The operative attempt is attended with imminent danger. There is almost a certainty of the patient being destroyed, as shown by the sad experience of the past. " We are not the arbiters of life and death of those who apply to us for relief. If people die in consequence of disease, it cannot be helped. They submit to it because they know it is inevitable. But we had better refrain from making such experiments as may

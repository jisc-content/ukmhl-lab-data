[ 407 ] In illustration of what has been said in these pages regarding the success attendant on the lateral method of lithotomy, when properl)^ conducted, the following list is subjoined of cases operated on by me in the Royal Infirmary. The accuracy of this statement can be authenticated by reference to the records of the house. For this reason I prefer limiting the.list, instead of republishing that given in the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal, No. 95, for April 1828, with the addition of my other cases, in private, since that periodâ€”though this would show an equally favourable result. Some cases, in which stones have been broken down and extracted by the urethra, are of course omitted in this list, as well as others in which concretions lodged in the urethra have been extracted by inci- sion of the perineum. It may require explanation why, in 1830, no pa- tients were cut for stone by me in the Royal Infir- mary. This can be given very shortly. By placard- ing in the streets, and such like means, a good many were induced to apply elsewhere. About the half of these individuals were cured; at least such is the statement of the result published and uncontradicted.

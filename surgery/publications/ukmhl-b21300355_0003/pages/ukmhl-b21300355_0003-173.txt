HYDllOCELE. 161 the disease in question. Sometimes it is attributed to powerful and habitual muscular exertion, as in blow- ing wind instruments, lifting heavy weights, &c.; and perhaps the impediment to the venous return, so produced, may be the cause of the effusion. The accumulation, as already stated, is gradual, and con- sequently the formation of the swelling is proportion- ally slow. It commences at the lower part of the scrotum, and by degrees ascends, at first globular> afterwards of a pyriform shape ; after it has attained a considerable size, the testicle cannot be felt in its usual situation, for it is now placed not at the bottom of the bag but towards its middle, and if the tumour be tense it can scarcely be felt at all. The raphe is displaced to the opposite side, the usual puckering of the scrotum has disappeared, and the tumour feels light in proportion to its size. On manipulation it is found yielding and elastic, and in all ordinary cases a distinct fluctuation is communicated to the fingers during alternate pressure. And by using the hand as a shade, the rays of light are made to permeate the swelling, rendering it more or less transparent accord- ing to the thickness and density of the covering, and the hue of the contained fluid. It is seldom that the distension of the vaginal coat is to such an extent as to reach the groin, consequently the spermatic chord is felt to be free, as also the inguinal aperture ; and even when the swelling does reach so high, the upper part is the least tense, permitting displacement of the fluid and distinct perception of the chord. The patient complains of a sense of dragging and weight PART III. L

CALCULUS VESICiE. 206 large, to facilitate its extraction, and many instru- ments have been contrived for the purpose. I have had no experience of the proceeding, but consider the following description of instrument as the best adapt- ed for the purposeâ€”strong, massy forceps, of consi- derable length ; the blades proportionally narrower, but much thicker, than those of the extracting for- ceps, and armed with several strong teeth, thick at their origin, tapering gradually, and terminating in a sharp ridge; the handles also thicker than they are broad, that they may not yield to the compressing force, and approximated by means of a combination of the lever with the screw. The foreign body is secured firmly between the blades closed on it; the handles are then fixed by a screw and nut, and com- pressing force is exerted by the lever acting both as a lever and a wedge. The screw, turned by the fingers, will suffice to crush many concretions ; and none can withstand the full power of the instrument. But it is, perhaps, safer to open the bladder above the pubes, and extract the stone through a wound in that situ- ation, when it is too large to pass betwixt the rami of the ischia. When the stone or stones have been extracted, and the surgeon has satisfied himself that no more foreign matter remains in the bladder, the next step in the lateral operation is the insertion of a gum-elastic tube, from four to six inches in length, according to the depth of the perineum, in calibre a little larger than a full-sized catheter, provided with a noose attached to each of two rings at its neck, and at its farther

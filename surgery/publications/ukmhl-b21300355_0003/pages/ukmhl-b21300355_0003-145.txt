133 KETENTION OF URINE. catheter should be deferred if possible. In cases of chronic abscess, the catheter must be used, and does no harm. In retention from injury of the perineum, the ca- theter should be passed before the patient attempts to make water, and the instrument must be retained ; thus extravasation of urine into the cellular tissue will be avoided. If extravasation has occurred, the perineum, scrotum, or other parts, must be freely incised wherever the urine has been effused, in order to prevent the direful effects of lodgement of that fluid; and then the catheter should be passed and retained as in the former instance. If the surgeon be foiled in introducing an instrument, as he may be, and if the prostate be sound, the bladder must be re- lieved by puncture from the rectum. Eetention from stricture is, as already observed, the most difficult to manage. No time can be put off in bleeding or warm bathing, in giving internal remedies, or exhibiting enemata. The viscus is ma- king violent efforts to relieve itself, and if these are left unassisted, or not rendered unnecessary, they may prove the patient's destruction. The system may be drained of blood, and the body parboiled, without the patient being relieved. The case re- quires immediate and decided practice; for whilst the surgeon is consulting about what is to be done, the urethra may give way, and the patient be lost. The discharge of a small quantity of urine may fol- low the introduction of small flexible bougies, but the

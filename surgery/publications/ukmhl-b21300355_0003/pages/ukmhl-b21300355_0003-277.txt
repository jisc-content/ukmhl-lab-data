I'llACTUllE OF THE SPINE. 265 respiratory nerves. If the chord is injured in the middle of the cervical region, there is paralysis of the upper and lower extremities, with distension of the bowels, and inability to void the urine ; the lower bowels have become insensible to the stimulus of dis- tension from want of their nervous energy, and the sphincter ani is paralysed. The bladder becomes dis- tended, and then incontinence of urine follows ; and frequently there is priapism. The quality of the urine is changed, the secretion of mucus from the bladder is vitiated and increased. Slow inflammation of that organ is induced, the urine becomes bloody and mixed with ropy mucus ; lymph is deposited on the lining membrane. Bruises of the loins often lay the foundation for degeneration and abscess of the kidney, with many of the symptoms of calculus vesicae, attended with red tongue and hectic, and ultimately terminating fatally. The effects of concussion of the spine are frequent- ly developed long after the infliction of the injury. There is formication, numbness, and difficulty of re- gulating the motions, in one or more limbs. Still the muscles are not shrunk, nor unable to perform powerful movements ; but the patient cannot put his hand or foot to the place he wishes, and cannot support the weight of the body without assistance.

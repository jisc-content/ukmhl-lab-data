305 FRACTURE OF THE LEG. Fracture may occur at any part of the leg. One or both bones may give way, either transversely or obliquely, according to the application of the force. The transverse fracture is produced by a direct blow, by a heavy body striking or falling on the limb, or by the lower part of the limb being fixed whilst the body is in rapid motion ; the oblique is caused by force applied in the direction of the bonesâ€”as when a person falls or leaps from a height, and alights on one foot, the limb being extended and the body erect. In the latter description of accident, it is frequently supposed, erroneously, that but one bone has given way ; fracture of the tibia perhaps is perceived some few inches from the distal end, whilst the fibula at that part is entire ; but by attentive manipulation, it will often be found that the fibula has sustained frac- ture, within a short space of its upper extremity ; the force was applied to the ends of the bones, and they gave way, each at the weakest point. The tibia is broken at its upper part, near the tuberosity, with or without similar injury of the fibula. There is considerable displacement, particu-^ larly in the bent position of the knee; there is no restraint to the action of the extensor muscles in- serted immediately above the point of fracture, and these, though not acting with unusual power, cause protrusion of the upper end of the tibia, the condyles of the femur serving as a fulcrum over which the muscles are stretched. This injury is usually the result of direct violence. PAllT III. u

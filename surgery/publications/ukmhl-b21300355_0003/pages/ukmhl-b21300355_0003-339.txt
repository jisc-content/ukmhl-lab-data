TJJXATION OF THE SHOULDER-JOINT, 327 directing' of the degree and continuance of the force is not the least difficult part of the procedure, for, when excessive, there is a risk of the axillary nerves and artery giving way; such accidents have hap- pened, and been accompanied with serious and even fatal consequences ; and from laceration of other tissues, the muscular, fibrous, or cellular, fatal inflam- mation and abscess have resulted. The surgeon is therefore called upon to exercise judgment and dis- cretion—not to continue extension to a pernicious extent, and not to abandon attempts at reduction too soon, leaving his patient disabled for life. For making counter-extension to the extension by pulleys, a broad strong belt is useful, perforated near the middle for transmission of the injured arm ; it is passed round the body so as to fix the tnmk and scapula, coming under the axilla of the sound side, and being then fastened by means of a hook to a ring in the wall. Luxations of the shoulder-joint may be, and have been, reduced after the lapse of two or three months ; but the difficulty increases, and the chance of suc- cess diminishes, in proportion to the time which has elapsed since the date of the accident. And in de- ciding upon making the attempt, many circumstances are to be weighed and considered—the patient's period of life and his occupations, the state of the parts, the degree of motion that has been acquired, and the treatment, if any, which has been previously followed. Perhaps the most important consideration is regarding the state of the parts, as indicated by the degree of motion. If the movements be to such an

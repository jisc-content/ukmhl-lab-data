68 INFLAMMATION OF THE RECTUM, undermined, and in some cases it is difficult to ascer- tain the depth of the abscess, even with the aid of a long probe. Owing to the loose nature of the texture surround- ing the gut, abscesses near the anus often attain a great size, and extend deeply before there is much external indication of their existence; a hardness is felt on pressing the fingers d.eeply by the side of the tuberosity of the ischium ; this is at first obscure, but gradually becomes more developed ; and at last a small dark red spot appears, indicating that the mat- ter has approached the surface, and is most superfi- cial at that part. But the surgeon should not wait for the pointing here, as the matter may burrow much previously, and abscess form in the substance of the sj)hincter, or exterior to it. If the matter does not cause ulceration of the coats of the intestine, and escape into its cavity, pointing takes place, and the pus is discharged externally, in general through a small opening, The matter is of a very ofiensive odour. The external aperture, and even the whole cavity of the abscess, may be at a distance from the gut, but in most cases the matter is close to it: its coats are denuded, and often ulcerated through. The surrounding degree of induration, the quantity of con- tained matter, the extent of the cavity, and the situ- ation of the opening, vary almost in every instance. Cases occur of induration, often very extensive, in the neighbourhood of the anus, on one or both sides, with dark discoloration of the integuments, and burning pain. The affection resembles carbuncle.

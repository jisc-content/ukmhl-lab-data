59 OF LUMBAR ABSCESS. more jDroniinent in the erect position, and is also increased by exertion of the abdominal muscles ; an impulse is given to it on coughing. As it advances, and comes more to the surface, fluctuation is percei- ved. This is the most common site in which the abscess presents itself; but it is not unfrequently met with on the outside of the vessels, either lower or higher in the thigh, above Poupart's ligament, in the loins over the crest of the ilium, and occasionally the matter is insinuated under the pelvic fascia and appears by the side of the anus. Large and neglected collections may work their way to the surface in two or three of these situations. The disease is often attributable to a sprain or wrench of the loins, or to exposure to cold and over- fatigue. Occasionally the mischief is confined entirely to the soft parts ; the vertebrae, a portion of the os innominatum, or the sacrum, may be denuded and of irregular surface, but this is evidently the result of the pressure of the abscess. A strong example of this, and of the extensive destruction of parts which this affection sometimes produces, may be shortly stated.â€”A very large lumbar abscess formed within a few weeks, in consequence of great and con- tinued fatigue and exposure to bad weather. At first it had been trifled with. At last it was opened in the usual situation in the thigh, and a vast quantity of matter evacuated. Thirty-six hours afterwards, the patient was sufi"ocated by a flow of purulent matter into and through the air passages. On dissection, the cavity was found to be immense, opening through the

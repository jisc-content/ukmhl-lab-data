356 BRUISE. this large space is filled up by a substance similar to tendon, so similar, indeed, that on post mortem exa- mination, some years afterwards, a careless observer could scarcely distinguish any difierence in the appear- ance of the various portions of the tendon. The treatment of lacerated tendon consists in placing the parts so as to relax the muscles whose tendons have suffered. In rupture of the tendo Achillis, the knee should be bent and the foot extend- ed, relaxing the muscle and approximating the sepa- rated ends. This is readily and conveniently effected by placing a slipper on the foot, and attaching to its heel a firm band, which is then fastened to a ring or strap placed on the thigh. This apparatus must be worn for six or eight weeks. Afterwards a high- heeled shoe should be worn for some time ; or if the union be still weak and imperfect, a splint may be placed on the fore part, resting on the dorsum of the foot and the fore part of the leg. Bruise. The effects of bruises or contusions are, separation of the cellular connexions, rupture of bloodvessels, and effusion of their contents into the cells ; a cavity, often large, is thus formed partly by the direct injury, and partly by the subsequent effu- sion, and it is quickly filled with blood, partly fluid and partly coagulated. Immediate tumour forms ; and the integument is discoloured, often beyond the principal swelling. The injury may, or may not, be attended with division of the integuments, or with fracture or displacement of the bones ; but all inju- ries of the hard parts are attended with more or less

Pressure by a large graduated compress is generally sufficient. In inflammation of the rectum, the exciting cause often is not discovered ; when detected it should be removed without delay. In simple inflammation of the part with yiolent fever, general bleeding may be required ; and in all cases blood should be abstracted locally and freely.

In retention of urine, or great irritation of the bladder, in consequence of the afiection of the rectum, the perineum should be leeched and foment- ed, perhaps also the lower part of the abdomen ; the catheter should be avoided if possible. When indu- ration takes place in the cellular tissue by the side of the anus, or in the perineum, suppuration must in ,all probability occur, and poultices with occasional fomentation are to be used, though only for a short time ; for, as already mentioned, pointing of the matter is not to be waited for in this situation ; inci- sion must be had recourse to early, in order to pre- vent bad consequences.

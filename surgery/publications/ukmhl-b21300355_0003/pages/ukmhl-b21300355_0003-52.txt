OF HERNIA. 40 person the subject of operation, as has not happened so far as I know, they would be felt by the finger used to conduct the knife. And the bistoury should never be passed—for there is no necessity for it—r through the opening so far as to meet with a vessel, even if awkwardly placed. The danger of cutting forward and to any extent has already been spoken of; such incision can answer no good purpose. The stricture is not in Poupart's ligament—though at one time it was proposed to cut this through without interfering with the tumour at all—but in the crural arch underneath, and in a manner independent of the strong tendinous chord and expansion. The crural arch is formed by the junction of the fasciae of the thigh and abdomen, superficial and deep. It is insert- ed into the linea ileo-pectinea, where the tendon of the external oblique has no connexion, and is strength- ened by fibres from the internal oblique, transverse, and recti muscles. The crural aperture formed by this arch is relaxed by flexion and inversion of the thigh, and by relaxation of the abdominal parietes. And this fact requires to be attended to, after opera- tion as well as during the taxis, so as to facilitate replacement of the protruded parts. The same attention to the state of the parts in judging of the propriety or not of reduction after operation, and the same after treatment, both general and local, is requisite in crural hernia as in inguinal. When the parts are reduced, the edges of the wound are brought together by means of a few stitches ; a graduated compress, of proper dimensions, is applied.

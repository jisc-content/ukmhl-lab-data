148 PIIYMOSIS AND PARAPHYMOSIS. ing the organ. When swelling of the prepuce or inflammation of the lymphatics is threatened, con- stant rest must be enjoined. In obstinate cases, dis- ease of the urethra is to be suspected as the cause, and the state of that canal should therefore be ascer- tained ; if derangement of structure or function is detected, then means must be forthwith adopted for its removal, the applications to the prepuce and glans being at the same time not neglected. Mercury can be of no use. Phymosis and JPara'phymosis are often connected with gonorrhoea of the prepuce, or of the urethra. The edge of the prepuce may be rendered tight by inflammation, swelling from effusion, or cicatrisa- tion of sores ; the tightness also attends irritabi- lity of the urethra, particularly in young subjects ; often it is congenital. The affection is termed Phy- mosis when the prepuce occupies its natural relative situation, but cannot be drawn back so as to uncover the glans. The contraction exists in various degrees ; sometimes the orifice is so tight that the flow of uritfe is obstructed, the prseputial cavity becoming swelled and distended every time the patient attempts to make water. In other instances the uuinjected glans can be exposed either in part or entirely, though with difficulty. In consequence of the prasputial cavity being frequently filled with urine, in cases of great contraction, urinary concretions have formed there or in the orifice of the urethra, giving rise to very annoying, and sometimes alarming, symptoms.

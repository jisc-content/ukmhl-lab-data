The tumour was mistaken for distension of the bladder, and a long trocar was plunged in above the pubes Muthout a drop of urine escaping. The patient died during the night. The bladder was found con- tracted, and the external cellular tissue of the abdo- men full of urine. When judicious and energetic practice is adopted without delay, patients often make wonderful reco- veries. The following may serve as an example— An elderly man laboured under retention, and his bladder became distended to a very great degree ; attempts had been made to relieve him, but jiroved unsuccessful. A catheter was passed, and retained for three days. During my absence in the country retention again occurred, followed by extravasation. On my return I found him insensible, but immediate- ly turned him round in bed, and opened the perineum freely, giving vent to fcetid urine, sloughs, and matter. Next day he was delirious and knew no one ; he hic- coughed and had cold extremities ; " he fumbled with the sheets," and " his nose was as sharp as a pen." A physician in attendance, well acquainted with disease, declared that he could not live six hours. But the urine had a free exit, the hiccough ceased on the exhibition of spiritus ammonise aromaticus, and wine and brandy were poured into him liberally, the only favourable symptom being, that he still retained the power of swallowing—when that is lost, all is generally lost.

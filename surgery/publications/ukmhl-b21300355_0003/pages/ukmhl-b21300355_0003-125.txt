113 STRICTURE OF THE URETHRA. debauchery, the stream of urine—which was pre- viously not much affected, at least to the patient's observation—comes to be very small; and frequently the urine can be voided only in drops, and that with much labour. Besides, the balance between the re- taining and expelling powers of the bladder often is lost, and either incontinence or retention of urine is the consequence. Though the urine be much ob- structed, even when the stricture is not very tight, the flow of the semen is not; the degree of contrac- tion must be very great to prevent ejaculation of the latter fluid. Indeed, during the healthy state of the parts, the whole urethra is much narrowed, as well as shortened, during seminal emission in coitu, from forcible action of the muscular fibres, and in- jection of the corpus spongiosum ; and the moment- ary contraction of the passage in such circumstances is perhaps greater than almost ever occurs in conse- quence of disease. Sometimes the seminal fluid passes back into the bladder, from an inverted action of the canal, and is evacuated along with the urine ; noc- turnal emission is a frequent concomitant of stricture. That an inverted or antiperistaltic motion sometimes exists in the urethra, is shown by a soft bougie being in such cases drawn into the bladder after having been passed but a short way into the urethra. In cases of bad stricture, the complexion is sallow, the countenance anxious, and the general expression of the features so peculiar as to be almost pathogno- monic. The lower limbs become emaciated and weak. Gout often accompanies stricture, and pa- PART III. H

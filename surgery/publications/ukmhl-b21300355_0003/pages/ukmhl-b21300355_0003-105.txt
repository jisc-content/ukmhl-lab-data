The most common cause, however, is the application of irritating matter to the lining membrane ; and this may take place during coition with females suffering from lecuor- rhoea, or during their menstrual discharge : but go- norrhoeal matter is the specific virus, and the appli- cation of it to the orifice of the urethra is by far the most frequent cause of inflammation of the canal. Irritating substances injected into the passage, may, and often do, produce or aggravate the inflammatory action. Besides all this, irritability of the urethra is common in gouty individuals. Gonorrhoea has been termed virulent when caused by gonorrhoeal infectionâ€”simple, when induced by ir- ritations such as those previously enumerated ; the distinction is seldom attended to, and is of no prac- tical importance. It has been supposed that the poi- son which produces chancre is the same with that which gives rise to gonorrhoea, the action being mo- dified by the texture in which the virus is lodged : such an opinion has been found to be wholly unte- nable. Gonorrhoea supervenes at various periods after ex- posure to the infection, from twenty-four hours to six or eight weeks, but generally in from ten to twenty days; often the time cannot be correctly as- certained ; much depends on the idiosyncratic sus- ceptibility of the urethra, on the degree of acridity in the matter applied, and other contingent circum- stances.

FRACTURE OF THE FEMUR. 291 quently in those of advanced age, when the form of the neck of the bone has been altered,â€”when it has become shorter, and attached less obliquely to the shaft; the bones, too, are then more brittle than in earlier life. The accident often happens from slight force, applied either to the farther end of the bone or to the trochanter, as by a fall in going up or down a stair. Though the height be not great, yet the patient's energies are weakened and he can make no effort to break the fall, and the weight of the body is thrown on either the fore or the back part of the trochanter. Though the fracture, in such an accident, generally extends beyond the capsule, and the processes are broken to a greater or less extent, yet occasionally the head of the bone is separated by transverse break of the neck without farther injury. This fracture occurs sometimes in those of middle life; and even in children, separation of the head of the bone may on good grounds be supposed occasionally to take place. The marks of fracture within the capsular liga- ment are inability to move the limb, pain about the joint on attempts being made to move it, and short- ening to a slight extent, as ascertained by comparison with the sound limb ; the patient being laid straight on his back, with the crests of the ilia in a line, either the knees or the ankles are looked to, and the comparative length of the limbs thereby observed. In some cases, neither shortening nor deformity is apparent for some time after the accident; there is merely want of power, and crepitation produced by

RETENTION OF URINE. 140 frequently been perforated by the catheter, and no unpleasant consequences resulted, the urine continu- ing to flow, perhaps freely, through the artificial opening there ; but still it is always an injury, often an unnecessary injury, and as such to be avoided. The catheter is to be passed steadily on till it ap- proaches the prostatic region, it is then to be guided by the forefinger of the left hand introduced into the rectum, and when the point is lost in passing through the gland, the instrument is carefully carried forward, and if long enough will infallibly reach the urine and relieve the bladder. It must, indeed, be a very extra- ordinary case in which the bladder cannot be reached with the catheter. When enlargement of the prostate, whether of the whole gland or principally of the third lobe, presents an insuperable obstacle to the passage of the catheter, and when the surgeon has taken care to assure him- self that such is the case, I conceive that he ought to perforate the gland in the direction of the natural course of the urethra, not with the catheter, but with an instrument better adapted for the purposeâ€”a long canula, or catheter with open end, very slightly curved towards the extremity, provided with two wires, one blunt and bulbous at the extremity, the other pointed as a trocar, both made so as to project a short way beyond the end of the canula. The canula is passed on to the resisting body, its orifice occupied by the bulbous wire, which is then withdrawn, and its place supplied by the trocar, the instrument being held steady in the proper direction. The trocar, or stilet,

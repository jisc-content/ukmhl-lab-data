342 LUXATION or THE HIP-JOINT. the toes are inclined neither outwards nor inwards ; the limb is immovably fixed, and this the most unequivocally marks the nature of the accident. The limb is lengthened when the trochanter major is split off, as also when severe bruise of the glutei has been inflicted without breach of continuity in any part of the bone, and without displacement. In the first stage of morbus coxarius too, a somewhat similar appearance and position of the limb is presented ; there is lengthening, but then there is also more or less wasting of the muscles, more mobility than iu the dislocation, and a marked history attached. Com- plicated cases occasionally occurâ€”as when a patient who has been labouring under hip-joint disease, per- haps not in an aggravated form, falls heavily, and on being lifted up is found to be incapable of moving the joint, the limb at the same time being elongated, and having a distorted appearance. An instance of this nature impressed strongly upon me the great necessity for accurate diagnosis in the first instance, and that such was to be acquired only by taking every circumstance into consideration. A young man was engaged in cleaning a slaughter-house, standing on two blocks of wood with his legs consi- derably apart. One of the blocks suddenly slipped from under him, and he fell with his limbs spread. He was carried home in great pain, and next day I was asked to visit him. The limb was elongated, and the hip flattened, the joint was stiff, and attempts at motion produced great pain ; but by perseverance the limb could be put in various positions, and the

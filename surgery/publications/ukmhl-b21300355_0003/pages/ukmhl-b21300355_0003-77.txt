65 HiEMORRHOIDS OR TILES. seem occasionally to take the place of the menstrual flux. The soft bluish tumours that are compress- ible, and fluctuate when large, furnish blood more readily and profusely than the hard and tubercu- lated. Much irritation is produced by piles, and some of them are more irritable than others. There are often extensive excoriation of the nates around, and pro- fuse discharge from the raw parts, particularly when the tumours are external. In such cases, flat, hard, warty excrescences often form in the cleft of the nates, and increase the irritation; these are termed fici, mariscse, and condylomata. In internal piles, a frequent desire to go to stool is induced, and more or less of the mucous coat of the rectum is protruded and swollen. The tumour, along with the protruded portion of bowel, may be- come strangulated if not replaced. By such, or other causes, inflammation is excited, which often extends to the neighbouring parts, and terminates in abscess ; but this is not so apt to occur from tumours seated high in the rectum, as from those about the verge of the anus. The usual cause of piles is obstruction to the re- turn of blood in the hsemorrhoidal veins; and this may be occasioned by advanced pregnancy, habitual distension of the sigmoid flexure and rectum with hardened faeces, or tumours of the abdominal viscera. Inflammation of the Rectum is attended with ex- cruciating pain, burning heat, and a feeling of con- PART III. E

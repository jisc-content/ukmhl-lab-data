The effect of an instrument passed through an organic stricture is to remove the irritability of the lining membrane, to excite the ab- sorbents to remove the newly-formed parts, and to dilate the passage : it may be supposed to act In some measure on the same principle as a bandage applied to a swelled extremity. The instruments in- troduced must be gradually enlarged till one readily passes of the full size, that is, one that enters the orifice with some difficulty, and fully distends the rest of the canal. Numerous contrivances have been employed for the dilatation of strictures ; but the preferable instrument is a silver catheter, or a bou- gie made of silver, of steel, or of plated metal. A soft gum-elastic bougie is useful in ascertaining the nature and situation of the stricture ; but in the treat- ment must give place to the metallic, slightly conical at the point.

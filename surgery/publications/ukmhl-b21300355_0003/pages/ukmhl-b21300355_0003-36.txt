OF HERNIA. 24 more hurried, and restlessness and intolerable anxiety sui^ervene. The patient becomes worse and worse every hour ; foeculent matter in large quantity is vo- mited or gulped up with great distress, and is com- mixed with bile, Avith vitiated mucous secretion from the stomach and bowels, and with whatever may have been recently swallowed; in fact, the peristaltic action of the alimentary canal above the strangulated part is inverted, and all the contents are ejected. Trouble- some hiccough comes on, and this symptom is by many considered as a sure sign of gangrene having taken place ; but it is often present when the bowels are quite free from tenderness or tendency to gan- grene. The extremities grow coldish; the pulse is unequal and fluttering, and with difficulty counted at the ankles. The countenance sinks, and assumes a leaden hue; the pain abates suddenly; the eyes are glassy; the tumour is flaccid, often livid and emphy- sematous. Now, the bowel may recede, and foeculent evacuation take place, with some relief; but the patient, after lying some time insensible, expires. All this may occur, either within twelve or sixteen hours after the occurrence of strangulation, or not till after many days. The rapidity of the symptoms and the danger are influenced by the size of the tumour and the condition of its neck, and by the nature of its contents. In small recent hernias, the advance from bad to worse is usually very rapid, the aperture through which protrusion has taken place being small, and effecting a great degree of constriction when dis- tension and engorgement occur. ^Vhen the neck of

It is had recourse to in order to induce syncope, or an approach to it, during which general relaxation takes place, and reduction may be attempted with advan- tage. With that view the patient is placed erect, and a large orifice made in the vein of one or both arms, so that a moderate quantity of blood suddenly ab- stracted may have a powerful effect on the system. In several cases I have found this practice beneficial, but am inclined to say, that in general, it will not be fol- lowed with success.

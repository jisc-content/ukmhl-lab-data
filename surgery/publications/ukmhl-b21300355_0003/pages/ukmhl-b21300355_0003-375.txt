The first step in the operation is to arrange the measures for temporary arrestment of the bleeding. The patient is placed in a favourable position, either sitting or lying, as may be most convenient for the particular amputation, and is firmly secured by one or more assistants ; all the apparatus must be in good order and conveniently placed, and an assistant should be stationed to attend to them, and hand those required. The compressor and the operator are each at their post, and ready to act in concert. The incisions may be made either from without in- wards, or from within outwards, after transfixion of the limb. The latter mode is to be preferred when practicable, as requiring less pressure ; the parts are more stretched than in the former method, are there- fore more easily and rapidly cut, and consequently less pain is inflicted. To the inexperienced trans- fixion may appear cruel, it may appal them, but in reality it is almost unattended with pain ; it is rapid- ly executed, and renders the operator capable of com- pleting his work with great quickness and little suffering, and at the same time with neatness and precision. The knife should be of a size and length proportioned to the incisions, straight-backed, and with a good point; of a form to pass through readi- ly, yet strong, and not too broad. With one sweep of this the incisions are made at once, through the

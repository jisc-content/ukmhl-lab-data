OF HERNIA. 38 held horizontally or nearly so. The aperture, thus formed, is enlarged by means of the probe-pointed knife, which is carried upwards along the forefinger of the left hand. Some recommend that the sac should be left undivided,and that the stricture should be relieved by passing the knife on the outside ; others, that only the neck of the sac should remain entire, and the stric- ture be attacked also on the outside of the j)eritoneura. But this appears an unnecessary and unprofitable precaution. The extreme difficulty of returning the sac is now well known and generally acknowledged ; indeed, reduction of it, whether opened or not, is practicable only in recent cases. Its neck, besides, is firmly constricted, and the bowel may and will remain strangulated when returned along with its sac, for the peritoneum long retains the contraction at its strictured point. This happened in an unfor- tunate case in which, on accoimt of the sac being unusually thick, and intimately resembling the struc- ture and feel of bowel, I unwittingly returned the tumour along with its covering. The bowels were not relieved, the symptoms continued unabated in urgency, and a fatal issue soon occurred. The stric- ture cannot be relieved unless the neck of the sac is cut along with the resisting fibres exterior to it. After the sac has been opened, the forefinger of the left hand is passed up to the crural ring ; and it should be recollected that this opening is very small, even in most cases in which a hernia of ordinary size has existed for some time. It is capable of great dilatxi- tion, however, as takes place in very old ruptures ; it may admit two or three fingers easily. But in general

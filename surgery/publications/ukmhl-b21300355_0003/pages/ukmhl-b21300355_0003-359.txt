LUXATION OF THE TAllSUS. 347 astraguliis for the greater security and strength of the joint. Subluxation, however, or sprain, may occur without injury of the bones : in this accident, should the parts not have spontaneously resumed their original situation, no difficulty is experienced in putting them to rights ; simple manipulation is suf- ficient. Occasionally, the foot is luxated forwards, by force applied either to the heel or to the fore part of the leg whilst the limb is fixed. The heel is shortened, the foot elongated; indeed the marks of the injury are so distinct, that comparison of the limbs is suffi- cient for diagnosis. Luxation may also take place backwards ; and in this case the heel is elongated and the foot shortened. In these accidents it is not un- frequently found that one or other malleolus has given way. Reduction is sometimes difficult. Ex- tension is to be made by grasping the foot and pull- ing whilst the limb is fixed, at the same time making pressure either backwards or forwards, as may be required. To retain the bones in their proper situa- tions, it is always necessary, at least prudent, to ap- ply a pasteboard splint to each side of the limb, par- ticularly when fracture of the malleoli is conjoined. Displacement of the Bones of the Tarsus may re- sult from great force ; for example, when the foot is squeezed under a heavy weight, one or more bones may escape from their connexions, and project; Re- duction of such displacement is exceedingly difficult at any period, and becomes almost impossible when inflammatory action is allowed to supervene pre- viously to attempts being made. The astragulus is

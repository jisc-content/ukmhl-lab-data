FllACTUllE 01" THE BONES OF THE FACE. 257 let the surgeon operate. If he amputate before this, his patient will most probably die on the table, or very soon after his removal from it; reaction will never take place, and sinking of the vital powers is accelerated by the ill judged interference. A greater or less time is required for the occurrence of reaction in different individuals ; the usual period is from two to six hours. Commencement of it is a sufficient warrant for operation; the surgeon must not delay till inflammatory fever has been lighted up, for then he will interfere with great disadvan- tage. He must then subdue the inordinate action as much as possible, and wait for the suppurative stage. When the patient has become hectic from profuse and long continued discharge, when perhaps no union has taken place—then also the limb must be remo- ved. In civil practice, patients as often recover from secondary as from primary amputation. But accord- ing to the experience of military surgeons, the re- sult is otherwise—.many recover after primary and few after secondary; much may depend on the accommodation of the patient afterwards. A great deal is left to the judgment, discretion, and conscien- tiousness of the surgeon. Fractures of the Cranium were treated of as con- nected with disturbance of the important organ which it protects. The bones of the face are occasionally broken and displaced. The frontal sinus is sometimes opened PART TII. 11

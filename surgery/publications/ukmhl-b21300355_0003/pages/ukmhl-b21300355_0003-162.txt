150 PHYMOSIS AND PAllAPHYMOSIS. solid and unyielding. When the stricture is very tight, the patient cachectic and irregular in his mode of life, and the case injudiciously or inertly treated, sloughing takes place rapidly, or phagedenic ulceration occurs anterior to the stricture. But in most cases the prepuce is not so tight as to cause complete strangulation, yet obstructs the flow of blood sufficiently to induce swell- ing of the included parts, breach of surface more or less extensive, and an unhealthy appearance of the ulceration. The ulceration is generally in the neigh- bourhood of the stricture, at first limited and super- ficial, but increasing both in depth and extent so long as the cause remains. The stricture is not situated anteriorly to the swelling, as has been supposed, but near its middle—where the tight orifice of the pre- puce grasps the penis, and causes a depression in the swelling. On separating the anterior and posterior tumours, the stricture is readily exposed, though pre- viously effectually concealed. In slight cases of phymosis, the orifice may be di- lated by frequent fomentation, and perseverance in withdrawing the prepuce as far as possible. When ulceration or secretion of matter has occurred, astrin- gent injections, at first mild, and gradually strength- ened, should be frequently thrown into the pra?putial cavity. Suspension of the penis should be enjoined, along with rest—of the whole body, as well as of the affected organ in particular. Wlien much inflamma- tion exists, antiphlogistic remedies must be put in force, followed by foir.entations. In bad cases, the prepuce must be divided in order to expose the seat

386 AMPUTATION AT THK SHOULDEll-JOINT. requires to be firm and uniform, and as there is always a risk of the thumb giving way from exhaustion, it is better to interpose some mechanical contrivance when the assistant is either diffident or inexperienced. The best apparatus for this purpose is a common door- key. A bit of lint or cloth is wrapped round the handle, and this part is then pressed down on the vessel. As in other amputations, the pressure is not commenced till the knife is about to enter. The flaps may be double, on the outer and inner aspects, or one may be made sufficiently large to cover the whole wound. The ptient is seated on a chair, and secured by a person placed behind. The arm is raised a little from the side, and supported by an assistant. Two oblique incisions are made, com- mencing high on each side of the shoulder, and con- verging gradually till they meet near the insertion of the deltoid. The triangular flap, so marked out, is dissected rapidly upwards, close to the bone, and kept raised by an assistant. The person supporting the arm then uses it as a lever, carrying it down- wards and backwards ; the joint, thus made more pal- pable, is cut into by a semicircular sweep of the knife across it; the head of the bone is now dislocated, and the rest of the capsule and fibrous tissue exterior to it divided; the blade of the knife is insinuated behind the head of the bone, and carried rapidly through the remaining soft parts. In no amputa- tion can I conceive any necessity for suspending the incisions, in order to secure vessels, provided the pres- sure is well applied, and the knife used dexterously. Here there is very little blood lost. The vessels di-

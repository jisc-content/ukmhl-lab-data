294 FRACTURE OF THE FEMUR. the patient is able to use the member, though not freely. Before swelling has taken place, crepitation can be jjerceived on laying hold of the trochanter whilst the limb is in motion ; and the trochanter it- self is found to be in a slight degree movable. Fracture of the upper part of the shaft is attended with immediate and great shortening ; the limb is much mishapen, and lies on its outer side, with the knee partially bent. The upper fragment of the bone projects ; the resistance to the action of the psoas and iliacus is in a great measure done away with, consequently these muscles raise the upper, whilst the lower end falls back and is drawn, upwards be- hind the other. In mismanaged cases, I have found on dissection the lower end of the bone lying in the sacTO-ischiatic notch, and a process advancing very different from reparation—necrosis. The marks of this accident are so conspicuous, that the surgeon is satisfied of what has happened without enquiring for crepitation. Rapid and great swelling takes place, if reduction and coaptation are not soon resorted to ; the bloodvessels are torn more and more by the ends of the bone, and effusion of blood into the intermuscu- lar cellular tissue is easy. Very soon more extensive and dangerous swelling takes place, the result of in- flammatory action, accompanied with startings of the muscles and greater retraction of the limb. Fractures of the middle and lower thirds of the bone are not attended with such great risk, and are more manageable in every way. There is less disfi- guration—the ends of the bone are not drawn by the

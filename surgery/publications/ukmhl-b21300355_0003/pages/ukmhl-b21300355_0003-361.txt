SPIIAIN. 349 in the injury. Sometimes small portions of the pro- cesses of bone are separated, being torn away, at- tached to ligament or tendon. All joints, both large and small, are liable to the accident. In the proxi- mal, or in the middle joints of the finger, for example, one or other lateral ligament is stretched or torn ; the finger is twisted to a side ; the joint is swelled ; and this swelling, with pain, is of long continuance, perhaps increased by repeated twists, or by impru- dent use of the joint. The elbow and shoulder are frequently sprained, as also the hip and knee; but the injury most frequently occurs in the wrist and ankle. It is generally occasioned by a fall, the foot or hand coming awkwardly to the ground, the mus- cles being at the time relaxed and unprepared ; by over-exertion in lifting heavy weights ; by entangle- ment and twisting of the limb, &c. The ankle is often sprained by what is called a false step ; the fore part of the foot comes in contact with an obstacle unexpectedly, the foot is twisted under the limb, the weight of the body is thrown on the apparatus of one side of the joint, and this is in consequence immo- derately and unnaturally stretched. Violent pain immediately occurs, and the patient is sick and faint. Discoloration and rapid swelling take place from extravasation of blood into the cellular tissue, into the sheaths of the tendons, and perhaps into the synovial pouches, in consequence of laceration of the bloodvessels. Effusion of serum and increased secre- tion of synovia afterwards occur, from incited action of the vessels. Thus the joint is deformed. Atten-

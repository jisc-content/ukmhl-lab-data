CALCULUS VESICA. 193 tus, and strict rest and abstinence from stimuli must be observed for a few days Various forms of drill have been contrived for act- ing on a large surface of the stone ; others for scoop- inar it out, the shell to be afterwards broken into fragments and triturated ; they are unsafe and inef- fectual. The instrument is also so constructed that a drill-bow may be used, and the apparatus may be fixed by what mechanics call a bench, or it may be attached, by complicated machinery, to the table on which the patient is laid, and be there secured in a proper position. But all this implies an intention of attacking large and dense stones, and a repetition of the attempts. So far as my experience goes,—and besides having seen Civiale and others operate, I have myself employed the instruments in a good many cases, and in some successfully,—I should dissuade from all endeavours to rid the patient of stone by such means, unless its size and consistence were such that it would yield to one or two attacks, and to the drill set in motion by the fingers. A plan of crushing the stone, by forcing one part of an apparatus against another by the stroke of a hammer, has been lately promulgated, and by a per- son who previously maintained that the grinding and rasping was quite perfect, though now regarding them as nought. This percuteur has a short bend at its farther extremity, one half separates from and slides on the other, and both are provided with teeth. It is very possible to entangle a portion of the blad- der betwixt its blades ; and, besides, these may bend PAKT III. N

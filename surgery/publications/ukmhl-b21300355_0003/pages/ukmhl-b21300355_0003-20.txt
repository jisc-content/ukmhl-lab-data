By hernia is meant protrusion or escape of the con- tents of any cavity, but the term is most frequently applied in regard to the abdomen. The protrusion may occur at various parts of the abdomen ; through the diaphragm, constituting Phrenic Hernia; through the umbilicus, constituting Exomjilialos; through the dilated apertures for transmission of vessels, con- stituting Ventral Hernia ; through the inguinal canal, constituting Inguinal Hernia; through the crural aperture, constituting Crural or Femoral Hernia.

It is but rarely that the bowels protrude through the sacroischiatic notch, or

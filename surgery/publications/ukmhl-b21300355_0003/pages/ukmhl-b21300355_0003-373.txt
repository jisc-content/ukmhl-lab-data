361 AMPUTATION. Many precautions are to be observed in this opera- tion. It is not to be commenced without due consi- deration as to the position of the operator, and of his assistants—their several duties—the form of incision —the length of the stump—the difficulties, if any, which may be expected, and the best means of obvi- ating them. The most prominent objects are, to save undue effusion of blood, to effect the incisions with as little suffering to the patient as possible, and to make them of such a form as to cover the end of the bone effectually—so that pressure may after a time be borne without risk of ulceration of the soft parts, or exfoliation of the bone. In all cases, and in all situations and circumstan- ces, haemorrhage can be restrained during comple- tion of the incisions, and during the employment of means to close the cut ends of the vessels, by means of very slight but exact pressure on the trunk of the principal vessel. The point at which this is to be applied, should be at as short a distance as possible above the place of incision, and at the same time above the origin of any branches which must be cut. Not the slightest pressure should be made until the instant when the incisions are about to be com- menced, so that no venous congestion may take place in the limb. All the blood in the limb, below the incisions, must necessarily be lost. The veins are more easily compressed than the arteries, and pres- sure, made a short time before the operation, may arrest the return of the blood, whilst it may not stop its influx ; thus engorgement of the lower part of the

CALCULUS VESICA. 184 of the kidney—alteration of structure in the kidney, and the lodgment of concretions in its pelvis,—are all attended by many of the symptoms of vesical calcu- lus. Irritability of the bladder, the nature of which has been elsewhere detailed, also possesses somewhat similar indications ; but the pain is usually referred to the hypogastric region and the perineum, as well as to the point of the penis, perhaps more frequently, and is generally relieved after evacuation of the urine—such is not the case in calculus. The symptoms of stone, when severe, will lead the patient to take such means as are necessary to ascer- tain the cause of them—to ascertain whether or not stone exists in the bladder. The term sounding is applied to such examination. In this proceeding the bladder should contain some ui'ine, so that the object may be effected more readily, and with less pain to the patient; he should be desired to retain his urine for one, two, or three hours, as he may be able. In the contracted state of the viscus, the stone may escape detection, if of no great size, from being embraced by the bladder, and concealed in its folds; or, on the contrary, it may be discovered either after or during evacuation of the urine, having eluded the surgeon's search during an over-distended state of the viscus.

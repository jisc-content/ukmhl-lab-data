199 CALCULUS VESICii:. neum, and of the levator ani, are touched with the edge of the knife directed downwards. Wound of the rectum is avoided by pressing it downwards and to the opposite side by the finger ; indeed the finger should be constantly in the wound, as a guide to the knife. In this stage of the proceedings,, incision up- wards would be likely to interfere with the artery of the bulb, whatever its distribution may be,—whether the vessel come from the pudic, or from the posterior iliac. It occupies nearly the same relative situation in either case, and by care can always be avoided during the second incision. Division of it occasions most profuse, alarming, and dangerous haemorrhage. I have seen the patient lose much blood in conse- quence during the incisions ; and after the occurrence of reaction, have seen the blood soaking through the mattrass, dropping from the foot of the bed, and col- lecting in pools on the floor. The bleeding is diffi- cult to arrest; the application of ligature is very troublesome, if not impracticable, and efficient pres- sure cannot be made with safety. In my own practice I have had no haemorrhage— chiefly, I believe, from never cutting upwards after the first incision—excepting one instance of secondary bleeding. The patient was sixty-one years of age, and had laboured under symptoms of stone for eight years. He had been dyspeptic for some weeks before the ope- ration, but otherwise appeared a favourable subject. Very little blood was lost during the operation, but on the fifth day haemorrhage occurred to the extent of seven ounces ; on the eighth day, the same amount was lost; on the twelfth, a pound ; on the sixteenth.

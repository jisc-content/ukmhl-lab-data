Patients affected with haemorrhoidal swellings,— the action of whose bowels is irregular, and in whom the vessels about the anus are congested,—are pecu- liarly liable to inflammation and abscess in the rec- tum or its neighbourhood, from the application of cold or wet to the surface, particularly that of the lower part of the body.

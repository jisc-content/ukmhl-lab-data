SARCOCELE. 170 Many of these tumours, as already observed, are of firm consistence ; others are soft and doughy. They occur at the middle period of life, or before it. Some are resolved easily, and by ordinary attention. Others enlarge, notwithstanding the most judicious treatment; they gradually soften, and at length fluctuation becomes apparent. Curdy matter is eva- cuated by incision, perhaps mixed with a small quan- tity of thin unhealthy matter ; and from the wound projects a pale fungous growth furnishing profuse discharge. The gland has now lost all appearance of its original structure ; a section of it presents a homogeneous surface, of a greyish colour, and soft consistence, at some places broken down and mixed with pus. The fungus is of the same nature as the rest of the tumour, but softer, and often with puri- form depots in its base. In this disease there is nothing malignant; it occurs in people of impaired or originally weak constitution, and is generally known as the scropliidous testicle. In the more simple swellings, the gland at some points retains its original texture, but the greater part has no tubulous appearance, and seems to con- sist principally of lymphatic deposit, dense, pale, and equable ; the tumour, in short, is a simple enlarge- ment. Such often accompany and are attributable to a diseased state of the urethra,â€”part of the canal being in an irritable and contracted state ; and all efforts to discuss them usually prove fruitless, unless the urethra have been previously restored to a healthy condition. The soundness of this canal is

112 STRICTURE OF THE URETHRA. the bladder becomes much strengthened in the coats, and diminishes in size. All the coata are affected, but particularly the muscular; the surface becomes fasciculated ; the fibres grow fleshy and strong, and are collected in large bundles. Cysts form, often of a large size; some are caused by interlacement of the enlarged muscular fibres, others are produced by outward protrusion of the mucous coat. This mem- brane being, by excessive muscular action in the vis- cus, pushed between the enlarged fasciculi, dilates into a bag, and forms a cyst of greater or less size, com- municating with the cavity of the bladder, generally by a narrow neck ; the protruded membrane is thick- ened by new deposit, and ultimately the parietes of the cyst, in some degree, resemble those of the blad- der. Cysts of this description are usually situated near the fundus of the organ, and often attain a large size ; in some cases the cyst equals the bladder in capacity ; and the two seem to form one large organ contracted near the middle. The secretion from the surface of the bladder becomes vitiated, is much increased in quantity, and passes off along with the urine or after itâ€”sometimes in solution, often separately. In se- vere cases the ureters and pelves of the kidneys dilate, and their mucous surfaces also contribute to furnish the discharge, in general slimy, ropy, and tenacious^ sometimes puriform. Discharge also takes place from the stricture, from the dilated portion, and from be- hind this; it is a kind of gleet, very apt to be in- creased by excess in drinking and venery. After

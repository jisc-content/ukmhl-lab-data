CALCULUS VESICA. 181 are equally friable as the preceding, and also both numerous and small. So brittle is their structure that they frequently break up by rubbing upon one an- other, or by being compressed one against another by the action of the muscular coat of the bladder. Their laminae in fragments, and the nuclei entire, are, in consequence, often evacuated along with the urine in considerable numbers. It has been elsewhere noticed, that cysts are apt to form in bladders which have been long subjected to irritation from any cause; it need therefore excite no surprise that such formations should be found in patients afflicted with calculous disorders. In one of these unnatural cavities a stone may lodge, both at first small. The concretion receives gradual increase, fills the cyst completely, and then dilates it in pro- portion to its own enlargement. So long as it is covered by the cyst, the patient suffers but little from it; but when, from the addition of calculous matter, it projects through the opening of the cyst, coming in contact with the coats of the bladder during con- traction of the viscus, the usual symptoms of stone are manifested. Sometimes there are several encysted calculi in the same bladder, but in such cases they are seldom of large size. The stone in the bladder—whether formed in the kidney, and having descended, or originally concreted in the bladder, either spontaneously or in consequence of the presence of foreign matter—produces very marked and distressing symptoms. There is fre- quent desire to empty the bladder, and the uneasiness

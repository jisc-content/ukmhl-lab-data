Should fixed and increasing pain be complained of in the hypo- gastrium, the part is to be leeched and fomented ; this is the only indication of inflammatory action which has occurred in any of my patients, and it has yielded to the simple treatment here mentioned ; so far as I recollect, in only three cases was the leeching necessary. Some patients require support very soon, almost from the first; others evirjce sufficiency of action throughout, and in them it is very necessary to pay strict attention to the state of the stomach and bowels, lest the action should exceed ; some pro- ceed favourably for a time, and then become torpid and stationary, their spirits and constitutional power flagging, in consequence of confinement and the dis- charge and irritation of the wound,—such also require judicious support, and perhaps slight stimulation.

289 FllACTURE OF THE PELVIS. off, without serious mischief ensuing, and may unite favourably. More extensive fractures, deeper in the pelvis, as in the neighbourhood of the acetabulum, are attended with excruciating pain on the least motion; in these the existence of fracture may be suspected from the first, but the extent of the in- jury is not fully known till after death. Fractures near the symphysis, and of the rami, either of the OS pubis or ischii, are usually attended with injury to the bladder, or to the urethra. Wound of the bladder is almost necessarily fatal, extravasation of urine, with all its fearful consequences, taking place in the loose cellular tissue connecting the upper part of the viscus to the parietes of the pelvis, and in the cellular tissue behind the peritoneum. The urethra may be lacerated by the sharp edge of fractured bone, or it may be ruptured by direct violence applied to itself. The latter case some- times accompanies partial diastasis of the symphy- sis, produced by the person falling astride on a beam. Either injury separately is sufficiently dan- gerous, and a patient with both is in a very preca- rious situation. Great extravasation of blood takes place in the perineum, scrotum, penis, and tops of the thighs, infiltration of urine quickly follows, re- tention supervenes, abscesses form, and the patient perishes under a train of symptoms already detailed when treating of the urinary organs. The treatment is seldom satisfactory. Absolute rest must be procured, and with this view the limbs are to be secured, and a broad band passed round PART III. T

376 AMPUTATION OF THE FINGERS. of the surface, and infiltration of the cellular tissue ; and in all probability, free incisions, followed by poul- tice and fomentation, will be necessary to restore the parts to quietude. Such consequences, therefore, are to be guarded against, by attention to the system, and avoiding all irritating dressing. The phalanges of the thumb are removed in the same manner as those of the fingers. Amputation of the metacarpal bone is accomplished thus. The thumb is grasped by the fingers of the left hand, and so managed. The bistoury, held in the same man- ner as for amputation at the proximal articulation of the finger, is placed with its point on the web be- twixt the thumb and forefinger, and carried in one sweep rapidly upwards in a slightly oblique direction, till it is stopped by the os trapezium. The point is used to effect disarticulation, the member being at the same time pushed steadily outwards; the blade is then placed behind the base, carried downwards close to the side of the bone, and is not to be brought out till sufficiently low down for forming a flap to cover the whole wound. After arresting the haemor- rhage, the flap is laid smoothly down, and retained in its proper position by bandage or slips of the adhe- sive plaster. The metacarpal bone of the little finger is removed by the same method of incision as for the thumb. In amputation of the fingers, the incisions sometimes require to extend beyond the proximal articulation, on account of disease having involved that part; in other words, it may be necessary to remove more or less of

It is rarely ne- cessary to have recourse to abstraction of blood from the neighbourhood of the articulation. There is no great risk of the bone again escaping from its situation. I have but once witnessed such an accident. A female suffered luxation of the hip nearly a month previously to her admission into the Royal Infirmary, and reduction was unavoidably deferred for three days more. It was accomplished without difficulty, and the usual precautions were afterwards adopted ; but next day it was discovered that luxation had again taken place. The patient had cunningly contrived to have ardent spirits brought to her, had indulged freely in these, got out of bed, and slipped down.

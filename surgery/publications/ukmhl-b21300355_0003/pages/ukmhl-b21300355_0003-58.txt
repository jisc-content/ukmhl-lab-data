When any portion has given way, of course no one can con- template reduction ; and when the whole calibre has sloughed, it is absurd to attempt separation of the adhesions which must exist, dividing the external from the internal parts. In mortification of the protruded knuckle, or part of the calibre of bowel, the symptoms are at first se- vere. These are vomiting, pain, and symptoms of enteritis; perhaps the bowels are obstructed for some time, but evacuation again takes place. Abscess occurs externally to the swelling, and on the giving way of the integument, matter, flatus, and thin faeces are discharged. A fcecal fistula remains for some time ; but, by the aid of lymph and granulations, the breach in the parietes of the bowel is repaired gra- dually, the feeces resume their natural course, and the external opening heals. When the whole calibre has sloughed, and even when a large extent of bowel has come away, there is still a chance of the patient recovering from the artificial anus by natural means, after the lapse of many months. As already remarked, the intestinal orifices retract, and come more into a straight line. A mucous discharge occurs from the lower bowels along with the passage of flatus, and at last part of the faeces is voided by the rectum. The discharge from the external opening diminishes, and ultimate- ly ceases, perhaps only a minute fistula remaining, through which a few drops of fluid, sometimes ffrcu-

CALCULUS vesica:. 194 or break, as they have done in one abominable case, in which incisions were required to disengage the instrument from the patient's urethra or bladder. Also, a stone may be laid hold of by the apparatus, and being so hard as not to yield to the impulse of the hammer, may become fixed in such a way as it cannot be freed from the grasp, there being no pro- vision for pushing it out as in the lithotriteur.

That it would do so was at one time industriously represented, and perhaps believed, by some of the advocates and promoters of lithotrity. If, by some miraculous in- terposition, the deposits from the urine should uni- formly be pulverizable, and the bladders be made of less irritable stulf than they are, and the affected in- dividuals be prevailed on to apply in due time, then might such pleasant anticipations be entertained, and then might we with some reason hope to see them realized ; but as matters now are, urinary concretions must, in the great majority of instances, be cut out of the bladder.

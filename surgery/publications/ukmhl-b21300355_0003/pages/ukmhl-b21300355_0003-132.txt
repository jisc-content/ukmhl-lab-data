120 STElOTUllE OF THE URETHRA. adoptedâ€”at proper intervals, and in proper gradua- tion, is continued as in ordinary cases. Sometimes, though rarely, the good effects of the first introduc- tion and retention quickly disappear, the stricture becoming tight and unyielding as before ; when this takes place, the practice is to be repeated, but not till after several days, and then the instrument will be retained with advantage for a longer time than before, provided no imtoward symptoms are caused by its lodgement. There are very few strictures, indeed, which will not yield to this treatment, when judici- ously planned and perseveringly followed. Fistulous openings generally close in a short time, when once the urethra has been widened. Their con- traction may sometimes, however, prove slow and im- perfect, even after the stricture has been entirely remo- ved, and the application of the cautery may be requi- site ; to accomplish this, when the opening terminates in the rectum, a speculum ani is required, by which to view the aperture, and ascertain its site, and along which to pass the heated wire with safety to the bowel. The cautery is not to be applied so as to produce an extensive slough, and much loss of sub- stance, but lightly to the edges. On the separation of the superficial eschar, the margins are raw, excited, and swollen, with a disposition to granulate ; and during cicatrisation of the sore, considerable contrac- tion takes place, independent of the formation of new matter. After the contraction thus efiected has oc- curred to its full extent, and not before, the cautery is reapplied ; and by a few repetitions of the instru-

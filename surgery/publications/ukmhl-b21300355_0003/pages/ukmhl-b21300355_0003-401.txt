889 AMPUTATION AT THE FOOT. sal bone, the bistoury is entered over the articulation of the metatarsal bone with the tarsus, and carried straight downwards, along the centre of the dorsum of the bone, till near its extremity; it is then in- clined to each side, in the manner described for am- putation of the metacarpal bones. The integuments are dissected off on each side of the longitudinal inci- sion, and the knife run up along the inside of the bone, till stopt by the tarsus. The surgeon now presses the toe outwards, so as to assist the disarti- culation ; and after this has been completed, the bis- toury is carried downwards, close to the outside of the bone, and not brought out till past the lower ar- ticulation. The external flap thus formed is then laid accurately down, so as to cover the wound, and retained. Or the flap may be formed previously to the disarticulation, by running the knife upwards along the outside of the bone, and then effecting removal. The operations on the other metatarsal bones are the same as those on the metacarpal. They may be removed, either entirely or in part, along with the corresponding phalanges, by operative pro- cedure similar to that practised on the hand. Sometimes disease of the foot is not so extensive as to require or justify removal of the whole organ ; the metatarsal bones are not involved throughout their whole extent. The same remark applies to in- jury by accident. In such circumstances, amputation is performed at the articulation of the metatarsal bones with the tarsus. The operator first ascertain^ the exact site of these joints, and then transfixes the

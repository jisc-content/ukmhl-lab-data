CALCULUS VESICAE. 214 Stretched so that its fore part may afford sufficient space for the high incision without danger to the peritoneum. With this view the perineum is incised, similarly but to a less extent than in the lateral ope- ration, and the membranous part of the urethra open- ed. Through this aperture the sound with a stilet for elevating the bladder is passed, and intrusted to an assistant; the incision above the pubes is then made, and the stone extracted, and a tube is left in the perineal wound for discharge of the urine. The plan appears feasible, though complicated, and likely to diminish hazard by preventing infiltration. The 9'ecto-vesical method should never be resorted to in preference to the lateral; in other words, it is unwarrantable, in my opinion, in those cases to which the lateral operation is applicable. It consists in ex- posing the neck of the bladder by division upwards of the sphincter ani and lower part of the rectum, and then either making a section of the prostate in the usual way, or dividing also the coats of the bladder in the posterior fundus, when the concretion is large. The cure is tedious and harassing ; the lu'ine and faeces are discharged together, and hardened fecu- lent matter may accumulate within the bladder ; the wound is long in contracting, and often cannot be made to close completely without much trouble, and after a long time ; often a fistulous opening remains, communicating with the bladder and rectum, and through this the urine continues to be in part dis- charged. It has been argued, that the recto-vesical method is advisable, M'ith the view of obtaining more

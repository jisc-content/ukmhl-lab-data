106 STRICTURE OF THE URETHRA. bouring parts, have been recommended, but are more injiirioiis than useful. Of Stricture of the Urethra.â€”By stricture is understood a narrowing* or contraction of a mucous canal, from deranged action, or from morbid altera- tion of its structure. It may arise from relaxation and turgescence of the parietes, or from effusion of lymph either under the lining membrane, or on its surface. Spasmodic stricture has been spoken of by some writers, but is most probably an imaginary disease. An irritable urethra, in which organic dis- ease does not exist to any great extent, may contract at various points, diminish the stream of urine, and prevent the introduction of instruments, or retain them by closing firmly round, and in such circum- stances the obstruction does probably depend on spasm of the muscular fibres of the urethra ; yet to such a state of the canal the term stricture cannot be applied with any degree of propriety. True, organic, or permanent strictures of the urethra, vary in their degree of constriction, beco- ming tighter when irritated by improper treatment, hard living, or exposure to damp or cold ; indeed all mucous canals are sensibly affected by cold and damp. From these causes a combination may be produced of permanent stricture and spasmodic ac- tion ; but, as already hinted, it would perhaps be well that this latter term, applied to urethral stric- ture, were forgotten, instead of remaining a conve-

OF HERNIA. 11 from the general peritoneal cavity down towards the scrotum, and which ultimately constitutes the tunica vaginalis. The orifice of this peritoneal pouch not closing immediately after the descent, may permit a fold of intestine to slip into its cavity, and remain in contact with the testicle. Or the testicle may, though rarely, contract in the abdomen an adhesion to a por- tion of bowel, and in its descent bring this along with it. In either case the bowel remains in its new situation, and constitutes congenital hernia. Hernia infantilis differs from the hernia conge- nita, and is a kind of protrusion peculiar to the early period of infancy. In the congenital form the pro- truded intestine is in immediate contact with the testicle, and surrounded by the tunica vaginalis testis ; but in this a process of peritoneum is interposed betwixt the intestine and the vaginal coat. The affec- tion occurs after the abdominal aperture of the sper- matic process has closed, but before the rest of that process has become incorporated with the spermatic vessels and their surrounding cellular tissue. In fact, only the peritoneum proper has closed, and forms the septum between the cavities of the abdomen and of the tunica vaginalis ; but being insufficient to with- stand the impulse of the abdominal contents, yields before it, and descending along with the protruding portion of bowel, forms its envelope, or the proper hernial sac, within the cavity of the tunica vaginalis. Such is the opinion generally adopted in regard to the nature of hernia infantilis; but its accuracy is doubtful. It seems more probable that the bowel, covered by a fold of peritoneum, is protruded into the

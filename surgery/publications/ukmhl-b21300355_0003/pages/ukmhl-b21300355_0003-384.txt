372 AMPUTATION. presses on particular points to prevent lodgement of matter. Sometimes the secondary haemorrhage is not an arterial and rapid flow, but a slow and continued oozing from a cavity, ulcerated, dark, and angry, round the end of the bone ; this seems to arise from diseased action in the cancellated tissue of the bone. Removal of the coagula, stuffing the cavity with dry lint, and the application and continuance of firm pres- sure, generally suffice for its arrestment. Hitherto, these general observations on amiDutation have regarded the operation by flaps only; the cir- cular method has not been mentioned. The reason is, that the circular amputation has been now almost entirely abandoned in this country, at least in this part of it. And its inferiority to the method by flaps is so obvious, and so generally acknowledged, that detail of the different steps of the operation is, I con- ceive, here altogether vmnecessary. It is more tedious in performance, more painful to the patient, does not afford so good a covering for the end of the bone, and consequently not so convenient and useful a support for an artificial limb, and the cure of the wound is protracted. The stump is always conical, tlie end of the bone is, ultimately at least, covered only by in- tegument, and from even very slight pressure this is apt to ulcerate; exfoliation of the bone follows to a greater or less extent, or unhealthy ulcer of the soft parts continues, along with caries of the bone, and partial death of its surface : and at length it becomes necessary either to perform a second amputation or

172 SAllCOCELE. sioiially with the acetate of lead, I have found in several instances effectual; repeated sloughing of the protruded matter takes place ; it sinks to the level of the integument, and ultimately below it, and then the employment of stimulating dressing induces con- traction and closure. Not unfrequently the testicle is attacked by swell- ings of a more serious nature—medullary sarcoma is common, as also both fibrous and soft tumours, with cysts ; schirrus is more rare. These morbid altera- tions may take place at once—that is, the swelling may be from the first malignant—or they may super- vene on tumours originally simple and benign. The tumour increases with the usual rapidity; to describe minutely the successive stages, would be but repeti- tion of what has been already stated more than once, in treating of similar diseases in other organs. The medullary tumour often attains a very large size before the integuments give way; it may in some cases be mistaken for hydrocele, unless the history be attended to, and careful manipulation made ; elasti- city must not be confounded with fluctuation. After ulceration has taken place, the formation of a bleeding fungus is not uncommon ; indeed, the testicle is the most frequent seat of fungus hcematodes. The ingui- nal glands are in general affected early, and swell to a large size,*" ulcerating extensively, bleeding, and throwing out fungi; not unfrequently the chord feels free and soft, appearing a healthy structure between the inguinal and scrotal swellings. In the advanced stages of schirrous testicle, the chord and its integu-

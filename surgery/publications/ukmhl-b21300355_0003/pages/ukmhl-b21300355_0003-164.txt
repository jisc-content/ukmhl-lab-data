There is danger in allowing the state of phymosis to exist long ; it has been already observed, that this condition of the parts predisposes to ulceration, ve- getations, and morbid secretions ; but besides, expe- rience has shown, that very many cases of cancer of the penis are attributable to phymosis, either conge- nital, or of long duration. In all cases, when the orifice of the prepuce is so tight as not to admit of exposure of the glans, the operation is expedient, the existing state of parts being very inconvenient; but it becomes a matter of absolute necessity, when there are extensive sores on the prepuce or glans, when there is much tumefaction or hardening of the parts, when urinary concretions lodge in the praspu- tial cavity or in the orifice of the urethra, when ve- getations or warts form on the glans, and when the prseputial orifice is so contracted as to seriously im- pede the flow of urine.

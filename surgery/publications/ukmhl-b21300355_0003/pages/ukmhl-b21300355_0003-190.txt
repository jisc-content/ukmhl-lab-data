178 CALCULUS VESICA. nates, as is well demonstrated by section of urinary- concretions. The red deposit, by much the most common, at least in adults, consists principally of uric acid, so- luble by solutions of the alkalies. The brown and yellowish are also composed of uric acid, often in combination with a base, and are likewise soluble in alkaline solutions, or in alkaline carbonates. The white is most commonly the ammoniaco-magnesian phosphate, soluble in acids ; rarely, it consists of phosphate of lime, not so white or friable as the pre- ceding, but likewise soluble in acids ; or it may be a compound of phosphate of magnesia, ammonia, and phosphate of lime, very white and soft, and impart- ing a stain to the finger, soluble in acids, but prin- cipally characterised by its fusible property. The dark, hard deposit, chiefly occurring in children, con- sists of the oxalate of lime, either pure, or in combi- nation with one or other of the preceding, very dense and soluble in acids. When these, by accumulation within the bladder, are formed into concretions, they are always mixed with more or less of a peculiar animal matter deposited from the urine. Passed by the urethra, and settling at the bottom of the vessel as the urine cools, they are termed either morphous, or amorphous, according as they are crystallised or not. To correct the calculous diathesis is an object of much importance ; solution of a concretion in the bladder is now allowed to be impracticable. The principal attention is to be directed to the digestive organs ; these must be brought into a sound state by

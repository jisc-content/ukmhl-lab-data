LUXATION OF THE WlllS r. '.V3S greater force is required to effect displacement here than at either the elbow or shoulder-joints, and vio- lence applied to the hand usually causes fracture of one or both bones of the forearm, not luxation of their extremities. Luxation, however, sometimes occurs, either from violent twisting, or from falling on the palm of the hand ; and the displacement may- be either of both bones or of one. In the latter case, it is almost uniformly the radius that suffers ; in the former, the luxation is forwards. Dislocation of the distal extremity of the radius is generally produced by a sudden wrench or twist. The bone is felt loose and prominent, sometimes riding over the upper part of the carpus. The posi- tion of the hand is towards pronation, supination can- not be performed, and, on attempting it, great pain is occasioned. Reduction is readily accomplished, by pulling the palm with one hand, whilst with the other the head of the bone is pressed backwards into its situation. Displacement of both bones is more frequently the result of a fall on the palm, with the hand bent much backwards. In this case there are two projections, so distinct as at once to mark the true nature of the accident, one anteriorly, formed by the ends of the radius and ulna, the other posteriorly by the carpus ; above the posterior prominence there is a consider- able depression. Here also reduction is easy; it is sufficient to perform simple extension with one hand, whilst with the other the wrist is moulded into its proper form. The after treatment, however, requires attention, for extensive laceration of tendinous and

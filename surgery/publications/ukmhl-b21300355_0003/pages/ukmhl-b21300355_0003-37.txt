OF IIEllMIA. 25 the tumour is large, and completely occupies the aper- ture previously to the strangulation, the progress of the symptoms is also rapid, for a similar reason. But if the hernia be large and of long standing, and if the protruded parts are not bulky at the point of protrusion, the constriction is in general not very severe, and-the distressing consequences progress more slowly. The symptoms are not so violent in epiplocele as in enterocele. In many instances of the former, the intestinal discharges are never obstructed, though great irritation and inflammation may be in- duced by the strangulation. There is also less dan- ger in entero-epiplocele, than in enterocele, compres- sion of the bowel being in the former instance dimi- nished by the intervening omentum. It is scarcely necessary to observe, that when the train of symptoms just detailed commences in any case, the surgeon must immediately enquire as to the existence of external hernia, for often the disease is concealed, particularly by females; all parts where protrusion is likely to occur, must be examined at- tentively. At the same time, the surgeon must bear in mind, that pain of the abdomen, with symptoms resembling those of strangulation, in fact, that en- teritis, with obstruction, may exist along with her- ; nia, but independent of it. A person with hernia is as liable as any other, if not more so, to inflamma- tory attacks in the abdomen from a variety of causes. The portion of bowel in the tumour may participate or not in the general abdominal affection ; if luiaf- fected, it may be reduced; it is neither painful nor

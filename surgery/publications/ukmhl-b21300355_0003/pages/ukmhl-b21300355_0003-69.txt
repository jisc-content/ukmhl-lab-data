The same train of symptoms supervene when the contents of the intestinal canal have been effused into the peri- toneal cavity, through an opening in the stomach or bowel, caused either by slow destruction of the coats, the peritoneum giving way last, or by a rapid ulcer- ation or sloughing process, as in hernia. The patient may live in agony for a day or two, but death gene- rally takes place much within twenty-four hours. All treatment is of no avail; venesection hastens the sinking. Fomentation over the abdomen, and seda- tives either by the mouth or by the anus soothe the patient, and render his last moments more calm. Penetrating wounds of the peritoneal cavity, if they reach the solid viscera and large vessels con- nected with them, are attended with effusion of blood externally and internally, in quantities proportioned to the size of the external aperture, the importance of the vessels concerned, and the vascularity of the part. The patient may perish from the bleeding, either instantly or after some time ; or inflammation and its consequences supervene in a violent form, and destroy him at a more remote period. The inflammatory symptoms are to be combated by profuse bleeding; in short, the utmost endeavours must be made to keep the action within bounds. When the intestines are wounded, the injured part may protrude; or the re- lative size of the openings, through the parietes and bowel, may be such, that the intestinal contents do not escape into the peritoneal bag. A natural cure takes place by adhesion of the surface of the bowel

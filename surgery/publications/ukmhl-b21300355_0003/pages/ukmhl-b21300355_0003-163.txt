PHYMOSIS AND PARAPIIYMOSIS. 151 of ulceration, morbid secretions, and vegetations. The preferable situation for incision is close by the side of the fraenum, much less deformity ensuing than when the prepuce is divided either laterally or ill front. The flaps are at first loose and flabby, but shrink as the oedeniatous swelling subsides. A straight director is introduced within the prasputial orifice— the groove pointing downwards^—and passed down to the reflection, close to the fraenum ; a sharp-pointed curved bistoury is slid along the groove till it also reaches the reflection ; by raising the handle and pushing it forwards, the integuments are transfixed there, and withdrawal of the knife by a rapid sweep completes the incision. Care must be taken not to pass the director into the urethra instead of into the praeputial cavity. It is very seldom that ligature is required to arrest bleeding. Should the cellu- lar tissue of the divided part not have been the seat of solid effusion, the integument and the lining mem- brane of the prepuce separate, leaving a large raw surface; and to prevent this a small suture should be passed between the membrane and skin on each side of the wound ; these may be withdrawn on the second or third day, the cellular tissue having then become consolidated, so as not to admit of retraction. A warm poultice is the best application for the first few days ; afterwards healing of the cut surfaces may be promoted by the application of a gently Stimula- ting lotion. Should oedema of the prepuce remain, this may soon be effaced by bandaging. By this operation sufficient space is obtained for uncovering

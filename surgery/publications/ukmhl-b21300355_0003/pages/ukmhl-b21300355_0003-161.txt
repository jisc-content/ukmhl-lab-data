PHYMOSIS AND rAllAPIIYMOSIS. 149 In consequence of Phymosis, the urethra and bladder may become diseased. It is often attended with pro- fuse puriform discharge, with sores of different kinds, or with warty excrescences on the glans and pre- puce ; sometimes the whole surface is completely covered with granulated prominences of various sizes, some large, but the majority small, some broadly attached, others suspended by narrow necks ; all generally furnish discharge of thin acrid matter. Adhesion may take place between the raw surfaces of the prepuce and glans, provided the parts be not frequently displaced for the purpose of ablution. Para/phymosis arises from the same state of the orifice of the prepuce as the former affection, only the parts are in different relations to each other. In phymosis the prepuce covers the glans, and the tight part is anterior to it; in paraphyraosis the prepuce is reflected over the glans, the tight part acts as a ligature round the penis behind the glans, and such swelling speedily arises in consequence of the con- striction as to prevent reduction. The glans and lining membrane of the prepuce swell anteriorly to the stricture, the integuments of the penis swell behind, and the stricture is depressed and concealed between. The cellular tissue there is necessarily very loose, so as to admit of free motion and change of relative position, and consequently the engorgement is often very great. The infiltration is at first serous, and the swelling is easily compressed ; but, from con- tinuance of the inflammatory action, lymph is effused and becomes organised, and the turgescence is more

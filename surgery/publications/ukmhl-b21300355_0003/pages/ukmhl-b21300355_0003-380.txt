AMPUTATION. 368 and I have occasionally been obliged to insert a wooden peg into the opening; to this a cord is attach- ed by which it can be removed after a few days. When bleeding has been satisfactorily arrested, the surface of the wound is to be cleaned of coagula, either with the fingers or with a warm and soft sponge, the ligatures are brought to the margin at convenient points, and the edges of the integu- ment are then put together by interrupted suturesâ€” two, three, or more, according to the extent of the wound. They need not be numerous, for they are only temporary, effecting partial approximation, and showing the line in which the parts are to be brought together by the after dressing. The stump is then covered with lint soaked in cold water, and this appli- cation is renewed frequently so long as any trickling of blood continues. Farther dressing is delayed for six or eight hours, when the oozing has entirely ceased, and the visible cut surface become glazed. Under this management, there is less chance of bleed- ing breaking out afresh than when the limb is encom- passed by bandages and pledgets of lint, perhaps com- pressed so as to interfere with the return of the blood, and heated by superfluous dressings. If bleeding to any extent should occur, as there is alwa5'-s a risk of, after the patient has become warm and com- fortable in bed, and reaction has been established, there is but little pain or annoyance in reaching the bleeding point, and taking measures to stop the flow; the few stitches are soon clijiped away, and then the surface of the wound is completely exposed.

114 STRICTURE OF THE URETHRA. roxysms of it are induced by irritation of the ure- thra ; the canal itself is said to be sometimes affected with a gouty action. Stricture may be caused by inflammation or long- continued irritation of the urethra, however induced —^by mismanaged virulent gonorrhoea—by stimu- lating acrid injections—by piles, and other irritations about the fundament—by calculi passing along the urethra. That gonorrhoea is a very frequent cause of stricture has been long known—" If the case be slubbered over, and long delayed, caruncles arise in the urethra, and in progress of time a carnosity." The passage or lodgement of calculi in the canal has induced stricture even in children; and calculus in the bladder «^ap^»8ed sometimes teproducesdisease in the urethra, and vice versa. Strictures are often caused by falls or blows on the perineum, and such cases are of the very worst kind; in some the ure- thra becomes almost entirely obliterated, in most the stricture is extensive and callous, and in all the dis- ease is overcome with difficulty. When stricture is suspected the urethra must be examined. A soft white-wax bougie is best adapted for ascertaining the state of the parts, but must be used very gently. If pushed forwards rashly and with force, the instrument yields before the stricture, and when withdrawn, is found twisted like a screw, or doubled backwards on itself. The vessels of the urethra may be torn, and haemorrhage, with great pain, ensue. The bougie should be slightly curved in its farther extremity, warmed either at the fire or by friction with the fingers, and well oiled, pre-

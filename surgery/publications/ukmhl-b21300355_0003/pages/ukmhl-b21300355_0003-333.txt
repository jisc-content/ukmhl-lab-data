321 LUXATION OF THE CLAVICLE. the end movable; and the evident and deforming projection puts an end to any doubt regarding the nature of the case. The bone is readily reduced by raising the arm, and carrying the scapula backwards. The limb must be retained in the proper position for many weeks, if a cure without interruption, and with as little deformity as possible, is desired ; but after the utmost care and patience, there still remains, in almost every case, some projection more than before the accident. The ligaments are slow in uniting, and the union is imperfect and weak. The requisite apparatus is the same as for fractured clavicle, but must be retained for a longer time. The patient experiences great relief from the limb being put up in this manner and maintained so ; and inflammatory action, with much of the swelling, is averted. The inferior angle of the Scapula occasionally escapes from under the border of the latissimus dorsi, usually with some laceration of the muscular fibres. The displacement is occasioned by raising the arm above the head to an unusual extent. The angle of the bone projects considerably, and the muscle is felt playing beneath it, more distinctly during motion of the parts ; the movements of the limb are limited and painful. The parts may be brought into their ori- ginal position by pressing the angle of the scapula towards the ribs, whilst the arm is much raised ; and the bone is afterwards confined in its proper place by a broad bandage passed tightly round the chest. The retentive apparatus must be continued for a consider- PART in. X

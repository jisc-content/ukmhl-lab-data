242 ENLARGED BUllS^. little pain, but exercise and exertion of every kind are seriously impeded ; constant and firm pressure on the swelling, with uniform compression of the whole limb, has been employed, with the effect of relieving all the symptoms, and rendering the limb much more useful, and by its continuance it is to be hoped that the disease will at least be considerably palliated. In the lower extremity, as in the upper, the htirscB become enlarged, in consequence either of pressure or of external injury. The aflfection may be acute, fol- lowing a blow or squeeze, but is most frequently chronic, enlarging gradually and with little or no pain, and caused by habitual pressure on the part. From this, it will at once be understood, why the bursa over the patella should be the one most com- monly affected.

It also occurs in shop- keepers, and other persons accustomed to shut draw- ers with their knee, or in other ways to make fre- quent pressure on that part,—in gardeners, and those employed in similar pursuits. In the acute swelling from injury, local depletion, fomentation, and rest are required, and these are generally sufficient to arrest the swelling, and promote its subsidence ; but, in some cases, the fluid deteriorates and the surface inflames, and free incision is required, followed by poultice, and afterwards by simple dressing.

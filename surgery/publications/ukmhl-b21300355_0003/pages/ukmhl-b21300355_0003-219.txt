207 CALCULUS VESICiE. extremity open at both point and sides. It is intro- duced along the forefinger in the wound, and its ex- tremity lodged fairly within the bladder ; a double tape is attached to each of the nooses at its orifice; one is passed up in front, and secured to the fore part of a broad band round the loins ; the other is brought under the thighs, and fixed behind. The object of its introduction is to facilitate the escape of urine externally, and prevent infiltration of the cellular tissue by this fluid. The wound, when made ac- cording to the directions which have been given, is both conical and dependent—the external opening is free, the internal small, the intermediate space gra- dually contracting as it approaches the bladder, and the inferior part of the wound of the integument is lower than the corresponding portion of the prostatic section ; thus the draining away of the urine is fa- voured, but it conduces very much to the patient's safety to ensure still farther its free escape by the insertion of a tube—part passes through the tube, and drops from its orifice, part flows by its side according to the laws of capillary attraction. For some hours after the operation, it is necessary to clear out the instrument frequently by means of a feather, otherwise its extremity will soon become obstructed by coagula ; in short, this must be perse- vered in till colourless flow from the orifice shows that the internal oozing of blood has ceased, and that nothing is passing but urine. When by salutary effusion from the vessels the surface of the wound becomes consolidated and imperviable to the urine.

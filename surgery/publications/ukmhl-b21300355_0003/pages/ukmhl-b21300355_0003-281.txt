FRACTURE OF THE CLAVICLE. 269 striking it against a hard substance in a fall. It generally gives way about the middle. The fracture, when occasioned by force applied to the acromial extremity, is usually oblique ; transverse when the force is applied to the shaft of the bone. The dis- placement is in most cases great; but when the frac- ture is at the bend near the scapular extremity,—a not very uncommon accident,—disjunction of the fractured extremities, is prevented by the attachments of the conoid and trapezoid ligaments. In ordinary cases, that fractured extremity projects which is at- tached to the sternum, whilst the scapular portion is depressed and carried inwards. In short, the scapular portion is displaced, the sternal is nearly in situ ; though, from the depression of the former, the pro- minence of the latter appears to be displacement. The arm falls forwards and downwards. The fracture is sometimes compound. The wound is generally small, and occasioned by the projection of the sternal portion ; or the integument may be divided by the external force. The nature of the accident is readily recognised. The deformity is very apparent. There is swelling, from extravasated blood, over the bone ; the shoulder is unnaturally approximated to the chest, and depress- ed. The motions of the extremity, those above the shoulder, are impaired. Crepitation is felt on raising the arm, and canying it backwards so as to bring the fractured surfaces into contact. When the patient is seen immediately after the accident, the bones are to be placed in apposition, and

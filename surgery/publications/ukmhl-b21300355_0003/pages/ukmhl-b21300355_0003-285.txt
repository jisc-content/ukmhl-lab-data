In the slighter cases, it is sufficient to restrain the motions of the chest by a broad bandage applied firmly round it; and a split cloth, or a scapulary, may be passed over the shoulders and attached to the cir- cular bandage to prevent its being displaced. Great and immediate relief is thus afforded. In those of a plethoric habit, blood may be taken from the arm, some hours after the injury, with relief and advan- tage ; it may ward off an inflammatory attack—and it is absolutely necessary to adopt this practice on the slightest indication of such supervening. The appear- ance of the countenance, and the state of the pulse and respiration, must be watched ; and on the first beco- ming anxious, the second strong and accelerated, and the third hurried and imperfect, active measures must be employed—venesection, antimony, purgatives, dia- phoretics, anodynes—one or all according to cir- cumstances. In the more severe injuries the same practice is pursued ; and the symptoms are watched with great care. The air in the cellular tissue, if effused in great quantity about the neck and face, and interfering with the functions of the parts, is to be evacuated by punctures. If the emphysema is slight, and confined to the neighbourhood of the injured part, farther extrication is prevented by the timeous and accurate application of a bandage ; the air already in the cellular tissue speedily disappears.

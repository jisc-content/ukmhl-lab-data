FRACTURE OF THE OSSA NASI. 259 and abruptly prominent and sharp at others. With the view of remedying deformity produced by dis- placement, and preventing the bad consequences already spoken of, the bones must be restored to their original position. They are to be raised by means of a strong probe or director, covered with lint, and introduced high into the cavity. Whilst, by means of this instrument, pressure outwards is made, the fingers of the surgeon are applied externally, so as to mould the organ into a proper shape. Unless force be again applied to the part, there is no risk of sub- sequent displacement; no apparatus is required to preserve the bones in situ. In compound fracture the detached spiculae are to be picked out, and the wound cleansed of blood and extraneous bodies ; its edges are to be brought neatly together, and retained by one or more stitches, with slips of unirritating plaster. Inflammatory symp- toms are to be warded off and combated by purga- tives, antimonials, local abstraction of blood, and fomentations. Formation of matter in the nasal cavity is to be prevented, by scarification of the swol- len membrane that fills the nostrils and precludes the passage of air; and if matter has been allowed to collect, it must be early discharged. Opening into the frontal sinus, whether the result of accident or of exfoliation, may sometimes be closed by paring the edges of the integuments and bringing them together, or by covering the deficiency with a flap borrowed from a neighbouring part. Such mea- sures should not be resorted to, in the case of open-

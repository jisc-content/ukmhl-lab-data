276 INJURIES OF THE SHOULDER. it is evident that fracture has occurred. Then, by the fingers in the axilla, whilst the humerus is raised and moved in diflferent directions, crepitation is recog- nised deeper and less distinct than in the former case; and the surgeon is warranted in believing that the glenoid cavity has sufferedâ€”that it is broken into fragments, or that it is separated from the body of the scapula by fracture of its neck : he is also war- ranted in adopting the means of cure suitable to such an accident. Many such injuries occur, yet it is strange that preparations illustrative of it are scarce- ly to be met with in our collections of morbid spe- cimens. How both detachment and luxation of the head of the humerus should occur, can scarcely be explained. Luxation certainly cannot take place after fracture; no force can be applied to the head of the bone suf- ficient to displace it. It is barely possible, that after luxation, force may be applied to the bone so as to fracture its neck. This accident is of very rare oc- currence, though by some supposed to be otherwise. I have had an opportunity of examining but one case, and that was very distinct; the head of the bone, completely detached from the shaft, lay in the axilla. Comminution of the head of the bone, with displace- ment of the fragments, is not uncommon. Separation of the head of the bone occurs occa- sionally in young persons, presenting the same ap- pearances and symptoms as fracture of the neck of the humerus in later life. Each, by a little care, is distinguishable from dislocation, even after swelling

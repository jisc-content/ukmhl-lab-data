396 AMPUTATION AT THE HIP J0I>;T. ing the sound limb. The other limb is supported by an experienced and intelligent assistant, who under- stands, and is able to perform, the movements to faci- litate the different steps of the operation. The com- jjression is intrusted also to an experienced and steady assistant, who, standing by the patient's side, presses firmly with one or both thumbs on the femoral artery, where it passes over the pubes ; and in this more than in any other operation, should the pressure be delayed till the instant of incision, for otherwise the blood lost in the limb will be immense. Transfixion, by a knife proportioned in size to the dimensions of the limb, is made horizontally, the in- strument being passed in a somewhat semicircular direction, so as to include as much of the soft parts as possible ; an anterior flap is made by cutting down- wards. During the passage of the knife across the joint, the assistant rotates the limb a little so as to facilitate the bringing of the instrument out with its point well inwards ; in the left limb the rotation will be inwards, in the right outwards. After formation of the flap, the assistant abducts forcibly, and presses downwards ; the joint is opened, the round ligament cut, the capsule divided, and the blade of the knife placed behind the head of the bone and the large trochanter; the posterior flap is then made rapidly. After transfixion for the superior flap, and when the sawing motion downwards has advanced but a little way, the compressing assistant shifts his hands into the incision imuicdiately behind the back of the knife, and so obtains a firm grasp of the femoral previously to its division. He retains this hold, at the same

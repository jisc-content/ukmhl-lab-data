36 OF HERNIA. passed upwards to the site of the internal ring, and if this be found narrow and contracted, the edge of the knife is to be directed against it in a similar way, and dilatation to a sufficient extent effected. Now reduction is to be commenced, and in doing so the same precautions are to be observed as in the employment of the taxis. In general, the omentum, if any, is put back first, and then the bowel; but this must depend on the relative quantity of the parts, and other circumstances. With the right hand the bowel is to be compressed as uniformly as possible; and, if at all obstinate, its reduction may perhaps be accelerated by pulling down a small portion at the neck, so as to facilitate the return of the faecal contents. By gentle pressure with the forefingers one portion is put back after another; it is wrong to attempt sudden and entire reduction; it should be gradual and successive. In many cases, from adhesion, or from the bulk and nature of the hernia, the parts, though sound, cannot or ought not to be reduced ; a portion may be got back, bu t part requires to remain. This can often be ascer- tained beforehand by proper enquiry into the history of the case, as to the duration of the disease, and the period at which the whole tumour could be made to disappear. In such cases, the stricture should al- ways be freely relieved. When the bowel is morti- fied, and its contents effused into the sac, care is to be taken not to detach or disturb the adhesions at the neck, and the bowel should be opened so as to allow free discharge. When the bowel or omentum are comparatively sound, though irreducible, the surgeon

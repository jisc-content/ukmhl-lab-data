390 AMPUTATION OF THE LEG. foot at that point, passing the knife close along the plantar aspect of the bones ; carrying the instru- ment downwards, a sufficient flap is formed to cover the stump. The integuments on the dorsum are then divided in the line of articulation, the joints divided successively, and the parts removed. The flap is raised, adjusted, and retained. In dividing the articulations, it is to be recollected, that the base of the second metatarsal bone, reckoning from that of the great toe, is lodged considerably higher than the others ; and, therefore, the knife must be inclined upwards at that point, or else the use of the saw is requisite. The stump thus formed proves exceedingly useful: the subsequent lameness is not great; the heel and tarsus compose a very efficient support for the weight of the body, and the flexion is unimpair- ed ; by attention too, the deformity may be in a great measvire concealed. In short, the surgeon who am- putates above the ankle, for disease or injury not ex- tending to the articulation of the metatarsus with the tarsus, is guilty of a serious error. The disease may reach higher than is compatible with the preceding operation, and yet it may be pos- sible to save the heel. In such cases amputation is performed in the articulations of the os calcis with the OS cuboides, and of the astragulus with the os naviculare. The, plan of the incisions is the same as that for the operation at the bases of the metatarsal bones. No amputation is more frequently performed than that of the leg. Operation near the ankle is inad-

The instrument on being thus passed into the bowel is fixed by the finger, and by drawing both outwards, the coats of the bowel and the parts intervening be- tween them and the sinus are divided. All colla- teral sinuses extending towards the perineum and hip must be freely divided, for they cannot be ex- pected to csotract otherwise. Such is all that is necessary in the generality of cases ; but it is evi- dent that the steps of the operation, and the extent and number of incisions, must be varied according to circumstances. A great part of the affected bowel may be pulled down by a director before being cut, as is sometimes done ; but the practice is useless and painful. Should haemorrhage take place, it may be restrained by stuffing the wound gently with lint; if this fail, the bleeding vessels are to be secured by- ligature ; but this is seldom necessary. The bowels should be well cleared out before the operation, so that two or more days may pass over without the parts being required to perform their functions ; and if the bowels are naturally loose, opiates may be ad- ministered. Afterwards copious evacuation is to be procured by enemata or gentle laxatives. It is neces- sary to prevent the external part of the wound from adhering, until the whole has contracted equally, and begun to be filled up by granulations from the bot- tom ; and with this view a piece of lint is interposed between the margins. Stuffing the wound daily with large dossils of lint is attended with much pain, and imi)edes the cure. The dressing should be simple and

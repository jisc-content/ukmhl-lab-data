AMPUTATIOM AT THE ELBO\V-,I()I M T. .'381 inner flap, the surgeon, as soon as he feels the knife rounding the radius, rotates the forearm gently in- wards, and in transfixing for the outer flap similar rotation is made outwards. Sometimes slight diffi- culty is experienced in tying the interosseal artery. The flaps are brought together, and treated in the way already mentioned. ' In all amputations of the upper extremity, it is of importance, and indeed a rule scarcely to be depart- ed from, to leave as much of the limb as possible ; for here the longer the stump, the more useful is it to the patient. In accordance with this maxim, am- putation at the elbow-joint may be required, when either disease or injury extend too high for amputa- tion in the forearm, but not too high for the forma- tion of an anterior flap over the joint. The limb is steadied in the supine position, compression being made near the middle of the humeral ; the knife is passed horizontally across the condyles close to the bone, and brought downwards and forwards to a suf- ficient extent for the production of a flap, which is alone to form the protecting cushion. The joint is then cut through, the knife is passed down till ob- structed by the olecranon, and with one sweep a se- micircular incision of the posterior integument is made. All soft parts in this line are divided, and then the saw is applied to the olecranon process. This amputation is easy, rapid, and beautiful in execution, and when the flap is sufficiently large,—as it always may be, for there is no want of soft parts in front,— the stump is well formed and useful. The flap is laid

An incision is made through the integument and fatty matter, from three to four inches in length, in the mesial line, and terminating over the symphysis pubis ; the recti and pyramidal muscles are then separated, the cellular tissue cautiously divided, and the fore and lower part of the distended bladder exposed. The coats are pierced at the most, inferior part, and an opening made sufficient for the introduction of the finger. By the finger the dimen- sions of the stone are ascertained, and then the wound is enlarged upwards to such an extent as will by di- latation admit of the extraction. Forceps are intro- duced, of sufficient length and grasp, and the foreign body removed without laceration or bruising of the parts. The patient is then laid on his side, a piece of dressing being interposed between the edges of the wound to favour the discharge of the urine exter- nally. The escape of this fluid may be free and co- pious, and the wound may close favourably ; but the majority of the patients on whom this operation has been performed, have perished either from urinary infiltration, from peritoneal inflammation, or from exhaustion. Fortunately, I have never had occasion to resort to it. It has been proposed to combine this mode of ope- ration with wound of the posterior part of the ure- thra from the perineum, in order that a free and de- pending outlet may be aff'orded to the urine, and also, that by introducing instruments into the bladder from the lower opening, the organ may be elevated and

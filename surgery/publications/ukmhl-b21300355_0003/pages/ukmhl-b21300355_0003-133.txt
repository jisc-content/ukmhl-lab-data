STRICTURE OF THE URETHRA. 121 ment at long intervals, the opening is brought to close. At one time attempts to destroy the contraction oi the urethra, by the application of caustic to the stric- ture, were in great vogue ; but the total inefficiency of such practice is now generally acknowledged. The armed bougie was applied hundreds of times, at considerable intervals; and the mode of treatment, though trying, tedious, and hurtful to the patient, must have proved useful to the surgeonâ€”but to him alone. Years were spent in such trifling, and not un- frequently serious consequences followed this treat- ment, or rather neglect, of the disease. Cutting ca- theters are dangerous, as well as inefficient for the cure of stricture ; thrusting at the end of a long stric- ture can avail but little, and in the hands of most practitioners the instrument is as likely to perforate the coats of the urethra as to enter the stricture. Incision of stricture may be required in retention of urine, scarcely otherwise. The practice is noticed under the treatment of retention. In stricture ante- rior to the scrotum, it is well to avoid incision, if pos- sible, as it generally is, for a wound there is healed with difficulty, if at all. Retention of Urine is not to be confounded with suppression of the secretion from the kidneys, arising from disorder of the structure or function of these organs. The kidneys perform very important func- < tions ui the animal economy, and complete suppres-

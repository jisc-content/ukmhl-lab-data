A wart forms, generally at the lower part, assumes an irritable appearance, and quickly degenerates into open ulceration of a malig- nant character. The ulcer extends rapidly, consu- ming the neighbouring integument, and involving the testicle and other subjacent parts in induration and enlargement. The induration extends along the sper- matic chord, and the lymphatics participate in the diseased action at an early period. The discharge from the sore is acrid, sanious, and possessed of much foetor; sometimes fungi protrude, but more common- ly the surface is excavated and smooth. Not unfre- quently the skin surrounding the ulcer is studded, to a considerable extent, with numerous clusters of warts, of an unhealthy and angry aspect. The general health is soon undermined, and the disease advances from bad to worse with the usual certainty and rapidity of malignant action. It seldom occurs till after the age of thirty or forty ; and though most frequent in chimney-sweeps, is not peculiar to them. No treat- ment can be expected to arrest its progress at an advanced stage ; the only opportunity of saving the patient is at the commencement of the disease, when the affected part is small, and before the lymphatics have become involved. Local application and internal remedies are not to be trusted to; the part must be excised. An incision is made wide around the wart or ulcer, and the included parts are dissected away to a considerable depth. When the testicle has become affected, the chance of success is much diminished ; 6

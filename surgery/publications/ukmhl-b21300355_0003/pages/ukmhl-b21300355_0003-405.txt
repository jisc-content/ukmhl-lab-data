AMPUTATION OF THE LEG. 393 untoward consequences took place. Discharge of clear fluid resembling synovia occurred on the second day, followed by very profuse suppuration, which proved of long continuance, and very exhausting ; in more than one case, the joint became anchylosed, rendering the stump very inefficient as a means of support, in consequence of being fixed at an inconve- nient angle ; and one patient sank, exhausted by the profusion of the discharge. I then found, from re- peated examination of the parts on the dead subject, that it was very difficult, nay impossible, to excise the head of the bone without either wounding the synovial pouch itself,—that is, dividing the capsular ligament,—or opening a bursal cavity, beneath the popliteus muscle, communicating with that of the knee-joint. It is scarcely necessary to add, I have since wholly abandoned this method of operation. It has been already observed, that high amputa- tion of the leg is preferable amongst the poor. The limb is of much greater use to the patient than were the stump longer ; he is able to follow his occupation with greater ease and security, and at less expense, by resting on the knee, than by using the artificial. limb applied to the middle of the leg. The wealthier patient, however, can afford a more expensive sup- port, and a less efficient, though more handsome con- tinuation of the limb suffices. In such circumstances, amputation is performed at the middle of the leg; and after cicatrisation, the artist supplies an artificial support resembling the natural limb ; thus the mo- tion of the knee is preserved.

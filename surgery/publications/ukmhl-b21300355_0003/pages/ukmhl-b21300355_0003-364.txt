The integuments soon become re- laxed, during the regular use of fomentation, and tension and vascular action subside, as also pain. The swelling then abates, and is no longer hard ; it pits on pressure, and the skin has a puckered appear- ance. Then gentle friction becomes advantageous, and uniform support should be afforded by the appli- cation of a flannel roller. The longer the limb is disused, the more perfect and rapid is the recovery, provided the rest of the cure be properly conducted. In general nothing more than what has been stated is required. But if the limb be moved, or stimu- lated in any way, early, then necessity will arise for antiphlogistic measuresâ€”perhaps venesection, cer- tainly copious and repeated abstraction of blood by leeches, accompanied with fomentations, and the in- ternal exhibition of antimonials, purgatives, &c. When such is the case the cure is tedious, the joint long remains swelled and stiff, the patient is lame and incapable of exertion. Leeching or puncturing at an early period, with the view of allowing extravasated blood to escape, is useless and hurtful. The effused and coagulated blood cannot escape, and suppuration, followed by destruction of the cellular tissue, has often been the consequence of such ill-advised proceedings. Fric- tion with stimulating liniments, or even simple fric- tion, at an early period, is also hurtful, as tending to

153 PHYMOSIS AND PARAPHYMOSIS. ed for here, as in the case of strangulated hernia; and it ought to be remembered that the organ is one of importance, and that its loss would ren- der most people miserable. To attempt relaxation by fomentations, and such like, is absolute folly; the stricture cannot yield to such remedies; and, from increase of swelling, strangulation will become more and moi'e complete. Cold, too, is incapable of reducing the swelling; cold, or astringents, can- not possibly diminish the size of the vessels, whilst return of the blood in them is prevented by tight stricture ; and so long as the stricture remains, the serous effusion cannot subside, but will increase. Besides, the application of cold will hasten the occur- rence of gangrene, in as much as it tends to diminish the power of parts which are already in a weakly condition. The parts must be instantly replaced. With the fingers of the right hand, the surgeon grasps the glans, and by firm and continued pressure diminishes its volume, whilst with the left he endea- vours, by steady pulling, to reflect the swollen pre- puce over the glans, which he is at the same time pushing back, as well as lessening. By uniformity and perseverance in these manipulations, more than by any force, replacement will often be accomplish- ed. He will be able to judge, from the duration of the disease, and from the appearance and feel of the parts, whether simple reduction, that is, with- out having recourse to the knife, be practicable or not. In some cases, particularly when gangrene is imminent, there is danger of twisting off the glans.

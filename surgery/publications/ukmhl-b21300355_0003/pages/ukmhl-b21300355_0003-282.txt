270 FRACTURE OF THE CLAVICLE. retained, without delay, and before inflammatory swelling has come on. No complicated apparatus is required. A pad, firm, though of soft material, and large enough to fill the arm-pit completely, is rolled in a shawl and placed in the axilla ; it is retained by tying the shawl over the opposite shoulder, a soft pad being interposed between the knot and the skin to prevent excoriation, and is farther secured by tying the ends under the axilla of the uninjured extremity, which should also be protected by a small cushion. A few turns of a roller, or a handkerchief, are placed round the arm and chest, so as to secure and fix the limb ; so the retentive apparatus is completed. The shoulder is thus raised, and removed from its unna- tural position ; and the fractured exti'emities of the clavicle, previously placed in accurate contact, are prevented from being again displaced. The elbow and forearm should be supported by a sling, otherwise the unsupported weight of the limb dragging on the shoulder will cause considerable pain, and subsequent displacement will be apt to occur. The apparatus should be looked to occasionally, adjusted and tight- ened ; and the cushions should be replaced by fresh ones, to prevent excoriation and uneasiness. The bone will be found to lie quite smooth, to remain of its proper length, to unite, generally within twenty days, and that without any unseemly exuberance of callus. No evaporating lotions are necessary. No compresses or splints need be applied over the bone. If the patient be bruised in other parts, and become feverish, it may be requisite to abstract blood and exhibit nn-

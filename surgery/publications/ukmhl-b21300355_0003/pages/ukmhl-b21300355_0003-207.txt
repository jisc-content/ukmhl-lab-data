It has been said that lithotrity is applicable, when, from the advanced age of the patients and the rigidity of the parts to be cut, lithotomy is not. This statement is incorrect, at least the latter part of it. Old people, from 70 to 80, and even beyond, recover, when the operation is conducted quickly, without loss of blood, and so as to guard against infiltration, as certainly and rapidly as young persons. Perhaps no operative procedure has been more can- vassed than that of lithotomy. The subject has been discussed, and the operation attempted, by many not very eminently qualified. All sorts of contrivances have been made and promulgated in connexion with this operation; the greater number intended to supply the want either of anatomical knowledge or of operative dexterity. A volume would scarcely contain a catalogue even of the instruments which are in my possession,â€”crooked staffs, knives, spoons, and forceps. I shall content myself with describing what appears to me the most simple, safe, and certain procedure. The bladder may be opened, for the removal of stone, in various situations ; at its forepart, by inci- sions above the pubes; in the posterior fundus, by division of the sphincter ani and a portion of the bowel; at its neck, by cutting upon it through the perineum. The first mode is termed the high opera- tion, the second the recto-vesical, the last the lateral. The lateral shall be first considered; it is the safest, the most advisable,and the mostfrequently resorted to.

CALCULUS VESICAE. 183 often attributable *to intemperance, or to over-exer- tion. The intensity of the symptoms also depends on the nature and size of the concretion, and on the idiosyncratic irritability of the patient; in some peo- ple the bladder is naturally so acutely irritable as to be thrown into the utmost disorder by the most tri- fling cause, whilst in others sources of greater irrita- tion produce but very little uneasiness. The mul- berry or oxalate of lime calculus is of very rough surface, and gives rise to the most violent symp- toms. But the projecting portions of this, or of other rugged concretions, may become covered by additional and smoother deposit—or the surface may become smooth, polished, and water worn, receiving no addition for a long time—and in such circum- stances the sufferings are mitigated. However, in consequence of fresh incrustation, they may soon become again much aggravated, and almost intoler- able. The increase of the stone is in some cases exceed- ingly slow ; after many years, the size may not ex- ceed that of half a walnut. In others, large dimen- sions are attained within a short period. T'he mul- berry is always of gradual formation ; and the ra- pidly increasing are generally of the alternating cha- racter. The symptoms above detailed—many, and some- times all of them—may be produced by other causes than stone in the bladder.

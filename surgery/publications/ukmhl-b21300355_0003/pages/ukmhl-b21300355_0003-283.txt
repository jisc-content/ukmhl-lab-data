FRACTURE OF THE SCAPULA. 271 timonials, purgatives, &c. But all inflammation, arising from the fracture, subsides on the accomplish- ment of reduction, adaptation, and retention of the portions. If the fracture be compound, the edges of the wound should be brought together and retained, so as to favour immediate union. The body of the scapula is broken, generally by a severe injury of the chest, as by a hard and heavy body passing over it. There is little or no displace- ment ; and the accident is not easily detected, more especially after swelling has taken place. It is sufficient to restrain motion; and this is effected by passing a bandage round the chest, over the scapula, and round the arm. The acromion process may be broken off; but the accident is rather uncommon. The fracture is pro- duced by direct violenceâ€”a blow or a fall on that point. The spiiie of the bone also is sometimes broken by a like cause. Portions of the acromion may be separated along with the ligaments connect- ing the clavicle to it, in the accident of dislocation of the scapular extremity of that bone. The acromion is occasionally broken into fragments by heavy falls on the point of the shoulder. There is a slight appearance of flattening of the shoulder at first, and then great swelling. Crepitation is felt by pressing gently and alternately with the points of the fingers over the fractured part. The arm requires to be raised and supported by a sling.

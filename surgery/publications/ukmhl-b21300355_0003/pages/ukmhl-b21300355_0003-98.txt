Female patients have by some been cruelly treated; the vagina and dis- eased bowel have been laid into one loathsome cavity, and though the patients have continued to pass ex- crement and discharge through this cloaca, with the symptoms undiminished, themselves miserable and obnoxious to othersâ€”still such cases have been report- ed as cures ! In prolapsus ani, the protruded parts are to be carefully reduced, and kept so by means of a com- press supported by a T bandage ; often a spring with a pad is used with advantage.

They are usually of small size ; invested by the mucous membrane, thick- ened, congested, and consequently of a dark colour ; and either within the sphincter or projecting exter- nally. Internally, they may sometimes consist of blood, coagulated or not, effused between the mucous and muscular coats of the intestine ; but in general their inner structure is venous, at least in the first instance. Branches of the hsemorrhoidal veins, rami- fying near the inner surface of the gut, become vari- cose, probably from their superior trunks being com- pressed by hardened fcECulent matter or other ob- structions. The varix protrudes the superimposed mucous membrane ; and at first the excrescence is composed of the dilated venous trunks containing fluid blood, and invested by the membrane, which inflames, thickens, loses its villous character, and discharges a vitiated secretion. In this stage the tumour is easily compressible, and by pressure may be made to disappear almost entirely, the communi- cations between the varicose vessels and the trunks above being still unobstructed. But inflammatory action is soon kindled in the incommoded veins, as

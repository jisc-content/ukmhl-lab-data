246 EXOSTOSIS OF DISTAL PHALANX. The phalanges of the toes in general resemble those of the fingers in their diseased actions. Ex- ostosis of the extremity of the distal phalanx, how- ever, has no analogy in the upper extremity ; it is by no means an uncommon affection, and usually occurs in the great toe. The growth is generally globular and rough in its extremity, narrow at its origin, attached on the dorsal aspect, projecting ob- liquely upwards, and always of similar structure with the phalanx. Sometimes they are met with of a size nearly equal to that of the bone from which they spring, but the majority are considerably smaller. At first the patient complains merely of pain in the part while walking; soon the pain increases so as to impede progression very seriously; then the nail is found to be raised at its margin, and to cover a hard, unyielding, and tender swelling. The elevation of the nail increases, and the tumour becomes more apparent, covered by hardened cuticle, causing great uneasiness, and almost entirely preventing walking exercise. It has been recommended to expose the tumour by incision, and remove it at its origin. This affords temporary relief, but the disease is in no long time reproduced, and the incision must either be repeated, or the phalanx amputated. The preferable practice, according to my experience, is to remove the phalanx at once. It is less tedious and painful than the in- cision, produces very little, if any, impediment to progression, and of course is quite eflVctual in eradi- cating this most annoying though apparently simple disease.

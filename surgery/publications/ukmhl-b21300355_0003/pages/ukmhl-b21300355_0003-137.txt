In such cases the bladder often attains a very large size. At first the accumulation produces all the uneasy symptoms formerly men- tioned, but after some time these subside, and the urine drains away according as it is secreted, with- out, however, the original accumulation and tumour being diminished. This state of the urinary system is very common in old people, who neglect natural calls to empty the viscus during the night, or while sitting socially after dinner. The uneasiness gra- dually goes off, and when they at length think of making water, none can be got to flow. Sometimes they remain in this state—the bladder full, and be- coming more and more distended—for days, drinking gin and water, juniper tea, or other popular remedies. Incontinence then takes place, and the dribbling of the urine affords considerable relief; this state of matters is often allowed to continue for weeks.

Retention thus induced is

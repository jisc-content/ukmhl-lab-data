328 I,UXATION OF THE SHOULDER-.JOINT. extent as to favour the supposition of the head of the bone having been furnished with a new recipient cavity, to which it has in a great measure accommo- dated itself, and that the glenoid cavity has, from disuse, become altered, the surgeon can scarcely hope for advantage to his patient from attempts to break up the new articulating apparatus, and re-establish the old. The patient will, most probably, be put to a great deal of pain and some danger, â– without expe- riencing improvement to the limb ; indeed the mo- tions and jDower may prove less than before. In old men too, force sufficient for reduction cannot be em- ployed without great risk of laceration of nerves, bloodvessels, and muscles. But if the patient be young, the motions still limited, and the articulation apparently not changed by solid effusion, reduction may be attempted with a fair prospect of success, and without injury. In all such cases, however, the sur- geon must watch every step of the proceedings, and have sufficient experience to stop short of inflicting irreparable mischief. No standard can be fixed for the degree of force that is necessary and safe; he may be foiled, even after the most powerful efforts, in a dislocation of two or three weeks' duration ; whilst, by the use of but slight force, he may succeed in one of as many months. Much assistance is ob- tained by the means formerly adverted to as auxili- ary, by weakening the muscular energy. Of these, nauseating doses of antimony are most generally employed, and being the most safe, may be recom- mended to be tried first; and if these fail to produce

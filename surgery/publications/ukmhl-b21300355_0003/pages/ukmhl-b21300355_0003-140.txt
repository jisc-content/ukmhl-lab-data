RETENTION OF URINE. 128 Retention from affections of the prostate gland and necJe of the hladdei', inflammatory or indolent. In acute inflammation of the prostate gland and cer- vix vesicae, the other parts around swell, the mu- cous membrane becomes turgid and more villous, and the mucous secretion is increased. Suppuration may take place, and an abscess, chronic or acute, form in the substance of the gland, or in the cellular tissue exterior ; the parietes of the abscess may give way, and the matter be discharged into the bladder, into the rectum, or into the cellular tissue of the peri- neum.â€”Bloody and mucous discharge from the ure- thra, frequent desire to make water, sudden stoppage of the urine whilst making water, pain in the glans penis, and other symptoms of stone in the bladder, fol- lowed a fall on the back. Afterwards, a tumour point- ed into the rectum, and was opened ; purulent matter was profusely discharged, and afterwards urine esca- ped through the aperture. The patient died in three weeks, from irritative fever, with gastro-enteritic symptoms. Along M^th thickening of the bladder, and disease of its mucous coat, there was found a large abscess of the cellular tissue, communicating with an abscess in the third lobe of the prostate gland, and that with the cavity of the bladder. When the inflammation is less acute, the prostate slowly enlarges, from opening out of its texture, and deposition of new matter in the interstices. The whole gland may enlarge uniformly, but generally one part protrudes more than the others. When the third lobe enlarges, it necessarily projects into the

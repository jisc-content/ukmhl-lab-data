277 INJURIES OF THE SMOULDEK. has supervened. And it is highly necessary that the diagnosis should be correct and prompt, otherwise atrociously cruel and unnecessary proceedings will be adopted, and irreparable mischief occasioned. Lux- ation is attended with flattening of the shoulder and elongation of the arm, to a greater or less degree, according to the position of the head of the bone. But the elbow does not come to the side, and the motions of the limb are abridged; it cannot be ab- ducted to any extent, if the scapula is fixed. The head of the bone is felt under the pectoral muscle, or in the axilla ; and on rotating the arm gently, by laying hold of the forearm, and using it, when bent, as a lever, the head and shaft are found to move simul- taneously, all of a piece, and no crepitation is felt. Besides, the history of the accident is an excellent guide towards correctly ascertaining the nature of the injury. If the patient, in falling, have involun- tarily stretched out his arm, in order to save himself, and alighted with his whole weight on the palm or elbow, dislocation will most probably have occurred" If, on the contrary, he have pitched upon the shoul- der, without any intermediate breaking of the fall, fracture is to be expected. The evil consequences of false diagnosis, and of treatment formed thereon, are very apparent. A dis- location may be put up and treated as a fracture, per- haps till too late for reduction; and the patient will possess but weak and imperfect motion of the limb, after having undergone long suffering. On the con- trary, dreadful torments are inflicted on the patient

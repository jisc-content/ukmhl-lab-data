109 STRICTURE or THE URETHRA. bladder. Contractions in different parts of the canal depend much upon one another. When a tight stricture exists, the passage ante- riorly is never fully distended, and becomes perma- nently contracted in consequence ; whilst more or less dilatation is produced behind the tight part, wherever that may be. The enlargement often is very great, the urine lodges in the cavity formed by dilatation, and can be pressed out in a stream, or dribbles away after the patient supposes that he has done making water. Mucous and sabulous deposits often lodge in it; and calculi are occasionally retained there, may attain a large size, and may give rise to very unpleasant and even dangerous symptoms. Not unfrequently ulcer- ation takes place behind the stricture, and the urine becomes insinuated into the cellular texture ; but this tissue immediately around is in general condensed previously to the giving way of the canal, and so prepared by lymphatic effusion as to oppose effectu- ally extensive infiltration. Such is not the case, as will afterwards be explained, when solution of con- tinuity in the urethra takes place in consequence of distension of the bladder. In the gradual escape of urine by ulceration be- hind the constricted point—the urethra being neither altogether obstructed, nor nearly so—abscess forms in the cellular tissue, exterior to the ulcerating part. The suppuration is often slow in its progress, and imparts to that part of the perineum a stony hard- ness. Repeated collections of matter may form, and, if the cause be not removed, numerous openings will

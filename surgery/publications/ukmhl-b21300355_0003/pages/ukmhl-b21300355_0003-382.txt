AMPUTATION. 370 Bleeding within a few hours after the operation, before excited action of the vessels has commenced, is easily arrested by exposure of the surface, removal of all clots, for by these h£emorrhage is encouraged, and by including the open vessels in ligatures. For the accomplishment of this, the period and mode of dress- ing, above recommended, afford great facility, as has been already observed. Hiemorrhage at a later period is not common. It happens occasionally in consequence of the stump having acquired an un- healthy condition, from sloughing,—or from abscess, as when this occurs round ligatures which have been retained, along with the slough of the vessel aud cellular tissue, both ends having been cut away. The matter formed during separation of the liga- ture in the usual way, escapes readily along the pro- truding end, but when there is merely a knot, the integuments have most probably closed over, there is no direct outlet; the matter is confined, and causes ulceration of the coats of the vessel as well as of the surrounding tissues. In this kind of bleeding, it is needless to attempt finding the bleeding point by tearing open the stump, separating any adhesions that may have formed, causing much pain and re- tardation of cure. And even though the bleeding vessel or vessels could be found, they are not in a state to hold a ligature. The artery is surrounded by sloughing cellular substance, its coats are tender, and in no condition to assume a healthy action ne- cessary for permanent closure after deligation. If ligature is applied, the included part quickly sepa- rates, and then the vessel is as open as before. As-

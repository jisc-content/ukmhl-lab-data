400 EXCISION or DISEASED BONES. The bleeding from the soft parts is free; the vessels do not retract, and may require the application of a needle and ligature. That from the bone is easily- arrested by pressure ; the cavity is filled with charpie or with dossils of lint, and these are supported by a bandage. Some days after, this dressing is removed, having been previously softened and loosened by fomentation"and poultice. The cavity should now be examined carefully, to ascertain whether or not all the diseased parts have been taken away ; it is then dressed daily from the bottom. If parts of the sui*- face assume an unhealthy aspect, the granulations being either backward or flabby, to these escbarotics should be applied—the most suitable is the red oxide of mercury. Gradually the cavity fills up, and a de- pressed, firm, and permanent cicatrix is obtained. It need not excite surprise, however, if, in not a few cases, after matters have proceeded apparently very favourably for some time, the surface become pale, soft, and glistening ; the discharge thin, acrid, and profuse ; the integuments around tumid and disco- loured,—if, in short, the disease be in no long time fully re-established. The tarsal and carpal bones are often the subjects of this operation. In a few cases I have removed several, in others one or a portion of one, with suc- cess. In one instance the greater part of the astra- gulus was taken away, along with the ends of the tibia and fibula. There remained, in consequence, a large opening across the joint, through which a cord was passed, to facilitate gradual and piecemeal dis-

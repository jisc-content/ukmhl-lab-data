132 RETENTION OF URINE. of the organ. Injections into the bladder have been recommended, but are both hurtful and inefficient. Enemata, containing turpentine, or other stimulating fluids, are of service. In retention from inflamed urethra, the catheter should, if possible, be dispensed with. The intro- duction of it is excruciatingly painful, and will cer- tainly aggravate the original affection. Blood should be abstracted both from the system and from the perineum ; fomentations, with the warm bath or the hip bath, are afterwards to be employed. The re- tention is usually induced by over-exertion in exercise, or intemperance in living; these of course must be abandoned, and their opposites enjoined. Camphor, alone, or combined with opium, is to be given inter- nally in large doses. Opium may also be useful, administered in the form of an enema or suppository. If relief is not soon afforded by such soothing mea- sures, the bladder must be relieved by the catheter; and if the surgeon be foiled in the introduction of this, as he ought not to be, the only resource is to punc- ture the bladder from the rectumâ€”a harsh measure, to be sure, and one not indicative of surgical talent, but still preferable, in the eyes of both patient and surgeon, to death. In retention from abscess in perineo, a little delay is allowable under the employment of palliatives, when the affection is acute. The abscess must be freely opened as soon as its seat is discovered ; and until the evacuation of the matter, the use of the

RETENTION OF URINE. 131 tions alarming to the patient, and dangerous. In no disease are patients more grateful for relief, for in this the agony is often unbearable. Immediate abate- ment of all painful symptoms follows skilful and prompt measures; and the superior science of one man over others is made apparent to the most ignorant observer. In over-distended bladder from paralysis, the catheter can in general be passed without diffi- culty. It should be of a large size, and its introduc- tion should be repeated as often as nature calls for relief, perhaps three or four times during the twenty- four hours, until the viscus regains its tone; and this, unless irrecoverably lost, will generally be re- stored in a few weeks at most. Repeated introduc- tion of the instrument is here preferable to the re- taining of it; the latter measure should always be avoided, unless absolutely indispensable, for a foreign body lodging in the urethra and neck of the bladder must always be a source of more or less irritation; and experience shows that the bladder sooner re- covers its tone when the instrument- is introduced only to draw off the urine, when the uncomfortable feelings of distension come on, than when it is con- stantly retained. The patient soon learns to pass the instrument himself, and thereby saves the surgeon from frequent attendance, whilst, at the same time, the bladder is opportunely relieved. Stimulants, as the tinctura lyttse, given internally, with external friction, blistering, or the application of a moxa, may contribute towards restoration of the muscular power

379 AMPUTATION OF THE FOIIE^UIJM. steady assistant must be placed ready to compress the humeral artery as soon as the incisions are com- menced ; in the case of the forearm, the pressure is made at a low point of the artery; in the arm, the point of pressure will necessarily depend on the point of removal. The patient may be either seated or re- cumbent. One assistant compresses, another steadies the limb in the supine position. The surgeon holds the hand in his left, standing on the inside of the right limb and on the outside of the left. Suppose the right wrist is to be operated on,â€” the end of the ulna is felt for, and at that point the knife is entered ; it is held in a horizontal direction and pushed across the joint, emerging over and close to the end of the radius. By rapid and gentle sawing motion down- wards and forwards, a flap of sufficient size is then formed. This is retracted by the assistant, the joint is opened and its apparatus completely divided, the blade of the knife is laid behind the carpal bones, and by carrying it downwards and backwards, a, second flap is formed posteriorly, and the part removed. The dorsum of the hand may be so diseased or injured as not to afford sufficiency of sound parts for a posterior flap; in such circumstances the anterior must be made proportionally large, that it may alone cover the ends of the bones. After suppression of the bleeding, the flaps are approximated by one or two points of suture, and afterwards these are removed, and their place supplied by the adhesive plaster. Amputation, at any point between the wrist and elbow-joints, requires, in all, the same method of

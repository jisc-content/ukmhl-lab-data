139 RETENTION OF URINE. cases of enlarged prostate; in general the organ bears a good deal of distension, and the urgent symp- toms do not appear rapidly. Nevertheless, it is the duty of the surgeon, immediately ou being called, to relieve the bladder. When the prostate is very large, and retention has continued long, it is impossible to reach the bladder by the common catheter. Those who employ this instrument in such cases are often much puzzled ; they continue long in their fruitless endeavours, and, from rashness, generally produce a discharge of much blood, but no urine; they then become alarmed on finding the instrument always filled with coagulum, and suppose that blood has been effused into the bladder, and that the symptoms of retention have been thus induced. A catheter is to be used, which is two or three inches longer than the common one, possessing a larger curve, of such a| size as to admit of being passed easily, and not so small as to render it liable to interruption from the lacunae of the urethra. The posterior part of the urethra is elongated to no slight extent by the enlarge- ment of the prostate, and besides, the whole canal is stretched by the distended bladder rising high in the abdomen.

A cautious and persevering endeavour must be made to bring away the urine by the natural passage. Force is prejudicial and unnecessary. It is true, that the projecting third lobe of the prostate has not un-

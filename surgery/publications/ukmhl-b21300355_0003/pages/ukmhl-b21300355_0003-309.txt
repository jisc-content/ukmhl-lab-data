297 FRACTURE OF THE FEMUR. strong grounds for suspecting that many such have not sustained actual fracture. The neck of the bone may be shortened, and set on awkwardly, and there may be masses of new osseous deposit round the neck and the trochanters. Perhaps the history of the case is knownâ€”An old person sustains an injury of the hip by falling, or by a blow on the trochanter; great lameness ensues, and, after a confinement of many weeks, the patient begins to use the member, which, however, remains considerably shortened. But all this may have taken place, and, on examination after death, the parts may have presented the appearances above alluded to without fracture. The change in the bone is the consequence of diseased action induced by the injury. The bloodvessels of the bone and its coverings are excited, and new osseous matter is formed at various points ; at the same time, intersti- tial absorption of the cancellated texture of the neck gradually advances, and the bone is consequently altered in length and form. These appearances alone, therefore, do not warrant the confident belief of fracture having occurred, even though the history should seem to favour the assumption. And it ought to be recollected, that mere bruising of the parts about the hip is not unfrequently attended with in- ability to move the limb, with eversion of the foot, so as to relax the muscles which have suffered, and sometimes with slight apparent lengthening. In many patients advanced in life, who have sustained fracture of the neck of the femur, there is

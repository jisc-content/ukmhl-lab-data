EXCISION OF JOINTS. 402 required, and that proved insufficient to save the patient. In short, the results of excision of the knee- joint do not justify its repetition. Tlie articulating ends of the bones composing the shoulder-joint have been removed; and this may be done with advantage on account either of disease or of injury. This joint is, like others, liable to ulcer- ation of the cartilages, either primary, or in conse- quence of abscess and degeneration of the soft parts around. The disease is attended usually with pain- ful feelings increased by motion, and the patient is indisposed to attempt motion. Sometimes merely weakness of the limb is complained of, and the atten- tion is drawn to the wasted appearance of the mus- cles, particularly of the upper arm ; the deltoid seems shrunk almost to nothing. The motions above the shoulder are lost; and abduction is impracticable. Much pain is produced by pushing sharply the arti- culating surfaces into contact, and is further increased by rotation. The enforcement of strict and absolute rest of the joint, the establishment of a drain in the soft parts immediately neighbouring, and attention to the general health, often prove sufficient to arrest the progress of this disease. If, however, it is neglected, abscess forms sooner or later. On opening this, and introducing the finger, the joint is discovered to be open; the head of the bone is found detached from the soft parts, and unsupported. Or this state of parts may be ascertained to exist by examination through a sinus, either with a probe, or with the finger after dilatation. In these circumstances, an attempt may

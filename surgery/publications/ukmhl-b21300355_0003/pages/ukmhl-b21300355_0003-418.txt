406 EXCISION OF JOINTS. this flaps are raised, by making either a cross-cut in the middle, or one at each extremity ; in the one case the flaps are four, and triangular ; in the other, two, and quadrangular; by either method the bones are readily exposed. The joint is open- ed and dislocated, and the soft parts separated to the necessary extent from the bones. The ulnar nerve is avoided by dissecting close to the bone. The diseased portions are then sawn oflf. The wound is closed, and the arm kept bent. By the sanguine supporters of this operation, the after treatment is advised to be conducted so as to secure motion in the new articulation. From this I would dissent, for if the articulating ends of the bones have been actually cut off, the motion may be exten- sive enough certainly, but both joint and limb will be almost altogether impotent. It would be better to procure anchylosis in the bent position, than to have the arm dangling like a flail; in the one case the limb will be useful; in the other, ornament, and that too of an equivocal kind, is all that it can boast. Even anchylosis, in most cases, can be brought about only after the lapse of a long period. In the more severe affections of this joint, amputation of the limb is the operation which must ultimately be had recourse to, if the patient survive; and it is better to perform this at once, than after the experi- ment of excision has been tried and found wanting. I am well aware that parents have had to regret and mourn bitterly their having departed from sound advice, and lent themselves to such experimental trials on their offspring.

43 OF HERNIA. Often, on opening the sac, in long neglected cases, a discharge takes place of foetid air and thin faeculent matter, the bowel has mortified either entirely or in patches ; in the latter case, presenting the appearance of having been perforated at various points. Few constitutions can bear up under such mischief. In some, if an opening be not made, the integuments slough, and the patient, rallying after discharge from the bowel takes place, recovers after losing a portion of integument, of intestine, and perhaps of omentum. In others, and they constitute the majority, the sys- tem sinks before discharge from the bowel is effected, by sloughing of the external parts. The surgeon is called on to operate in the worst possible circumstances, provided the patient is not in articulo mortis. Even after many days of fsecu- lent vomiting, the bowels may be found tolerably healthy. The sac must be opened carefully, and the stricture is to be relieved without disturbing the adhesions that have formed. The bowel, when dead, or evidently moribund, is to be opened, and the discharge of faeces by the wound promoted. If returned into the abdomen, the sloughs will sepa- rate, and faeculent effusion take place, causing death in a very few hours. Sometimes the patient lingers longer than could be expected, and I have known a female survive upwards of a hundred hours after the occurrence of faeculent effusion into the abdo- men. The dressing should be light, and the pa- tient's strength must be supported in every way, by

OF HERNIA. 17 rupted, particularly if the patient exert his abdomi- nal muscles, or assume the erect posture. Whereas, had hernia existed, the swelling could not have been reproduced; and on the patient being directed to cough, a distinct impulse would have been felt with the finger. Hydrocele of the tunica vaginalis may- be confounded with scrotal hernia, if its distinctive characters be not understood or attended to. The pyramidal swelling is of an equal surface, fluctuates, and is generally diaphanous ; its formation is gra- dual, commencing at the lower part, and slowly ascending ; the testicle cannot be felt at the bottom of the scrotum ; there is no swelling at the inguinal canal, and the chord is felt free; the tumour is not affected by the position, motion, or exertions of the patient. These circumstances plainly indicate the nature of the case. Bubo, sarcocele, and acute swell- ing of the testicle, are sufficiently distinguished from hernia by their situation, form, feel, and history, and cannot be confounded with it save by the profoundly ignorant. Hydrocele of the spermatic chord is more likely to lead to deception when large; but it is gene- rally small and circumscribed, involving the middle of the chord, leaving the inguinal aperture free, and the upper part of the spermatic chord distinct. Be- sides, whatever may be its size, its formation is always slow and indolent, it is never capable of being pushed into the abdomen, and it is unaffected by those circumstances which contribute to mark hernia. But hydrocele of the chord and hernia may coexist, as in PART III. B

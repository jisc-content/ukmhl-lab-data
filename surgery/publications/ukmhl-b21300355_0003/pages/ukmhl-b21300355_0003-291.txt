279 FRACTURE OF THE HUMERUS. quires to be re-adapted occasionally, to have the parts under the crossings of the bandage, and under the knots of the shawl retaining the pad, well protected by soft pads, and must be worn for four or five weeks —perhaps, in some cases, even a short time longer. Then gentle passive motion of the limb is to be em- ployed, gradually increased as the painful feelings abate. If the parts are at once placed in apposition, and accurately retained, no abstraction of blood, either general or local, is required at the time, and is not likely to be called for during any stage of the treatment. No cold evaporating lotions are neces- sary ; fomentations are sometimes useful. Fracture of the Shaft of the Humerus is either oblique or transverse, according to the direction of the force applied. There is considerable displace- ment. The limb is always shortened to a certain extent, and the natural contour destroyed; the arm is useless, and bent towards the trunk, and the muscles are in a state of spasmodic contraction. The nature of the injurj' is at once and readily recognised. There is unusual and unnatural mobility of the arm, and distinct crepitation at the fractured point. There is great pain from the pressure of the lower extremity of the bone upon the nervous trunks. The large vessels are seldom torn—though the branches of the humeral artery, and the vessel itself, have in a few cases been ruptured—but there is often considerable bloody swelling in this as in all fractures.

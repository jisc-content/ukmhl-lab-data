167 HEMATOCELE. cellular tissue of the scrotum, or within the tunica va- ginalis, or in both. It is generally the consequence of a bruise or wound. From the loose nature of the cellular tissue, the effusion into it is apt, if proper attention be not given, to take place to a great, and to the patient and friends alarming extent. This I have witnessed after the operation for hernia, and after removal of the testicle—bleeding from some small artery continues, the blood is by dressing or pressure prevented from escaping externally, it is consequently extravasated into the cellular structure, giving rise to tumour; and in some cases this swelling, occurring' after the operation for hernia, has been mistaken for redescent of the bowel. The blood must either be absorbed or discharged. Absorption is the more safe and desirable, but necessarily tedious, and more or less thickening and enlargement may remain for a long time. Discharge, whether spontaneous or by incision, is usually followed by unhealthy suppura- tion of the infiltrated and partially broken down cel- lular tissue, sloughing of it, tardy separation of the dead parts, and tedious, perhaps exhausting, flow of matter. Haematocele of the vaginal coat may supervene on Hydrocele, in consequence of external injury; or bloody effusion may take place from the vessels of the membrane, from sudden abstraction of their custom- ary support, after evacuation of the serous fluid, and whether injection has been resorted to or not;—as happens in careless tapping for ascites. Some of the diagnostic marks of hydrocele are thereby lost; there

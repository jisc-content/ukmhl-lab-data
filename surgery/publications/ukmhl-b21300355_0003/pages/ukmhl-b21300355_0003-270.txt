FRACTURE OV THE OSSA NASI. 258 by fracture of the external plate. No small degree of force is required to effect this injury :â€”I recollect an instance of it, with opening into the sinus, occa- sioned by an attempt at suicide ; the man had struck his forehead violently with a large stone, wishing to knock his head to pieces. The integuments are gene- rally divided, and during expiration, blood, sometimes frothy, is poured out through the opening. When there is no wound of the integument, emphysema of the forehead and eyebrows has resulted from disrup- tion of the bones that compose this cavity, or others connected with the nostrils. T/ie ossa nasi are fractured and displaced by di- rect violence. They may be broken and commi- nuted without much displacement, or separated from their connexions and depressed without much frac- ture. Even slight cases are generally attended with laceration of the schneiderian membrane, and with profuse haemorrhage from the nostrils. The soft parts over the bones are thin and tense, and conse- quently in many cases divided. Great swelling is apt to ensue, at first either bloody or cedematous. In- flammatory swelling to a great extent, both exter- nally and internally, is to be dreaded and guarded against. Abscess of the schneiderian membrane, frequently of the septum narium, occurs from slight injuries, if neglected ; and, if not actively and pro- perly treated, may terminate in loss of substance and consequent deformity of the features. The existence of fracture of the ossa nasi is very readily ascertained; the part is distorted, being either uniformly depressed, or hollow at some points,

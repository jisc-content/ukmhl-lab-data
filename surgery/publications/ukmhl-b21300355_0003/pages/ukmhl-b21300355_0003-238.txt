226 YESICO-VAGINAT. FISTULA. by paring the edges, and then insertmg sutures ; but this is a proceeding both difficult in execution and not likely to prove successful; the thinness of the parts, the presence of a secreting surface on each side, and the oozing of acrid urine betwixt the edges, all militate strongly against adhesion. No benefit can be expected from any treatment, unless the opening be of no great size, and in such cases the cautery will be found most effectual. The speculum is intro- duced into the vagina, so as to expose the aperture, and guard the neighbouring parts from the cautery; and should the opening not appear distinct, a flexible wire is passed by the urethra, and insinuated through it. A small heated cautery is then slid cautiously along the speculum, and applied lightly to the mar- gins, with the view of producing a superficial slough; this separates, and during the consequent cicatrisa- tion the opening contracts. When the edges have again become smooth, the cautery is applied as before, and by several repetitions complete closure may ultimately be obtained. The interval between the applications is necessarily considerable; each must be allowed to have its full effect. Once I attempted to combine the cautery with the suture; first applying the heated Mare, and after separation of the slough, and when the margins were tumified, excited, and apparently prone to adhere by the formation of new matter, then approximating them by a species of twisted suture. At first, matters proceeded favour- ably, but the ultimate result was not very success- fulâ€”it was such, however, as to render the i)lan

272 FllACTURE 01' THE RIRS Fracture of the llihs. One rib, or more, may be broken by injuries in various ways—by blows of the fist—falls on hard bodies—pressure on the chest by heavy bodies passing over or falling upon it. They generally give way anteriorly to the angles, at the most convex point; but sometimes near the spine or the sternum. At the same time they may be par- tially luxated at either of the extremities. The frac- ture is generally transverse ; occasionally, and rarely, oblique. Sharp portions are seldom detached. The skin is sometimes divided, but more frequently the pleura and lungs are torn by the spiculae projecting internally ; hence effusion into the chest, and emphy- sema of the sub-cutaneous cellular tissue near the fracture, take place. The emphysema, if permitted, extends over the greater part of the chest, and even farther. Fracture of the ribs is attended with pain, parti- cularly during full inspiration ; and if the injurj'^ is severe, the patient is incapable, without great pain and exertion, of accomplishing full inspiration. He uses his handkerchief, sneezes, and coughs, with the utmost difficulty. Crepitation is felt by the patient, and is easily detected by the surgeon, by placing the hand on the suspected point, and desiring the patient to attempt full inspiration so as to grate the surfaces on each other. Motions of the trunk, and often of the upper extremities also, are attended with aggra- vation of the symptoms. In some cases attentive examination is necessary to discover crepitus—in cer- tain situations, and when perhaps one rib only has

AMPUTATION. 365 after formation of the flaps, round tlie bone, with its edge rasping on it, and as high up as possible. The instrument is then placed accurately on the point tlius exposed, close to the soft parts, and during the sawing the flaps are retracted by the hands of an assistant. The saw may be worked either horizon- tally or vertically : the latter direction is to be prefer- red, for thus, when the section is nearly completed, the uncut part of bone is deep, and less likely to snap on the weight of the limb being allowed to ope- rate, or when undue pressure is made downwards. If splintering of the bone have occurred, whether from neglect of the foregoing precautions, or by other ac- cident, the sharp projecting parts should be taken away, and the cut surface made quite smooth by means of the bone-pliers ; and with this instrument also, the sharp edge of the bone may be rounded off, in cases where subsequent pressure might cause ul- ceration or sloughing of part of the integument of the stump. The arteries are tied close to their connexions. Their cut ends are laid hold of with the dissecting forceps, and pulled out; a small firm thread, either linen or silk, is then applied tightly, and one end immediately cut away close to the reef-knot. Sepa- ration of the ligatures generally takes place from the sixth to the tenth or twelfth day; they produce little discharge or irritation during their presence, and no source of irritation connected with them is left behind. But when both ends are cut away close to the knot, separation is long of taking place, and

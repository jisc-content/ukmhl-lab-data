OF HERNIA. 13 of serum and a portion of omentum. The protru- sion could not be returned ; after relieving the stric- ture, the omentum was cut away, and the bleeding vessels tied separately. The patient died on the third day after. An analogous case is on record; and a third has been related to me by an old and experi- enced surgeon: In that instance, both the anterior and posterior layer of the tunica vaginalis, together with the true sac, were simultaneously divided; omentum and intestine protruded into the vaginal coat, and for a time the opening through the pos- terior part of that cavity and sac was mistaken for the inguinal ring. On extension of the incision, the nature of the case became more apparent, the stric- ture was relieved, and the protrusion reduced. Children are sometimes born with deficiency of the umbilicus, and protrusion of bowel into the loose cellular tissue of the umbilical cord ; the disease is termed congenital exomphalos. Almost all the viscera of the abdomen and pelvis are liable to protrusion—the stomach—the spleen— the omentum—the great and small intestines, and even some of their most fixed parts—the ovaria—the bladder. Also, right portions of the viscera occasion- ally escape on the left side of the parietes, and the left at the right. Hernial protrusion has received different names, according to the nature of its contents. When com- posed of a portion of intestine, it is termed Enter- ocele; Epiplocele, when composed of omentum ; and Entero-epiplocele, when both intestine and omentum have escaped ; and, as already observed, different

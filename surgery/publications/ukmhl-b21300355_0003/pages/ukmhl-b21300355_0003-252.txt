ANEURISMAL VAIUX OF THIGH. 240 after that for popliteal aneurism, compression is not to be trusted to, nor should the vessel be tied higher in the thigh. From imprudent reliance on the for- mer method I have known patients perish. An inci- sion must be made in the same line as the former, and a ligature placed on the vessel both above and below the bleeding point. The arteries of the. leg very seldom require liga- ture, except for wound. In such cases, the source of the bleeding must be the guide to the incisions, and these should be placed so as to interfere with the muscles as little as possible, always cutting in the direction of the muscular fibres. When the bleed- ing point is arrived at, the vessel is exposed to a short distance, and tied above and below the wound. During the dissection, it will in most cases be neces- sary to arrest the bleeding by pressure in the ham, either by the fingers of an assistant, or by means of a tourniquet. The thigh may be the seat of aneurwmal mri.v, the result of wound, as in the following case. Fourteen years ago, a young man wounded the lower part of his thigh deeply by the accidental thrust of a narrow chisel. The puncture was in the direction of the femoral artery ; violent haemorrhage was the imme- diate consequence, and after he had fainted the wound was stuffed and compression applied. In eiglit days the parts had healed, and he returned to work- as usual. But about twelve months afterwards, trou-

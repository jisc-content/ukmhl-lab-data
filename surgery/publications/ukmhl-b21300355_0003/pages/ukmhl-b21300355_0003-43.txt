It is, perhaps, only applicable to scrotal hernia. Cold has been applied to the tumour, and even ice, so as to produce frostbite, but little faith can be placed in such ; the practice becomes danger- ous after inflammation has existed for some time, the application diminishing the weakened powers of the parts, and accelerating gangrene.

403 EXCISION OF JOINTS. be made to check disease, and preserve the arm, by excision of the obnoxious parts of the bone. And this kind of operation is also justifiable when the head of the humerus has been shattered by musket shot; or when it has been exposed and injured by a splinter, or by a large shot, and the joint laid open. The situation and course of the incisions will be so far regulated by the openings or wounds already existing. They should always be made in the direction of the fibres of the deltoid, and the posterior aspect of the articulation is preferable to the anterior. One inci- sion, from the back of the acromion process to near the insertion of the muscle, is sufficient to expose the head of the bone, to allow all its remaining attach- ments to be separated, and to admit of its being turned out so as to be conveniently acted on by the saw. Merely the head is taken away. In sepa- rating the soft parts from its neck, the edge of the knife should be always directed to the bone, to avoid the nerves and vessels on the inside. In some cases of injury, very little additional wound may be requi- site. The glenoid cavity may, in consequence of being seriously involved in disease, also require removal; this is best accomplished by large cross-cutting pliers. Few vessels require ligature. The edges of the wound are brought together; and the elbow is supported, and the arm fixed to the trunk, in order to keep the bones in apposition, and prevent motion. This posi- tion must be retained during the rest of the cure ; and when the wound is on the outside of the shoul- der, as recommended, the dressing of it does not in-

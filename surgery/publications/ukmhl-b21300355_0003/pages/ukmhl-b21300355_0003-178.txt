Commonly it is sufficient to wear a bag truss, and avoid all causes of irritation to the parts; thus in- crease of swelling is prevented, and the inconvenience rendered trifling. If pain, with redness of the inte- gument, and additional enlargement, should super- vene, rest and the recumbent posture must be enjoin- ed for a time, combined perhaps with low diet and local depletion. But in cases of large inconvenient tumour, accompanied with atrophy of the testicle, rather than accede to the wishes of the patient and perform castration, the treatment recommended many centuries ago is to be put in practice—the apj^lication of a heated wire to the veins. The upper part of the tumour is grasped and made prominent, the veins are separated as much as possible from the other parts composing the chord, and a small-pointed cautery, a glover's needle, for example, is inserted at several points.

The cure is radical, and I have never seen the effects prove too severe. Rest and antiphlogistic regimen are of course necessary for some days after the ai)plication ; ab- straction of blood will seldom be required. Hccmatocele is an effusion of blood, cither into the

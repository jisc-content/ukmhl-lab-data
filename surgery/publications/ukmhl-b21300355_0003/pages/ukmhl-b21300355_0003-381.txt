AMPUTATION. and ligatures can be applied to those vessels which require them. Then, after removing all coagula, sutures are placed in the same perforations, and the stump is in as favourable a state as previously. After six or eight hours, as already stated, any clots that have formed are to be taken away gently, and the glazed edges of the wound are then brought accurate- ly and neatly together by the adhesive composition recommended at page 241 of Part I.,—with the dif- ference of being spread upon slips of oiled silk, which I have found to be more pliable, and altogether pre- ferable to the glazed ribbon. Interstices are left for the sutures and the ends of the ligatures, and the latter may now be abridged slightly. This mode of keeping the edges in contact I can confidently recom- mend from experience. The plasters are much more adhesive than those in common use, do not irritate, and are not loosened by discharge. After twelve or twenty-four hours, not longer, the sutures are clipped through and removed. No other dressing is required till the end of the cure, provided this proceed favour- ably. The part is kept cool, and the slight discharge which occurs in a day or two is wiped up from time to time, if it be in such abundance as to reach the oiled cloth over the pillow on which the stump is laid. No disturbance of the parts is necessary as when ointments, bandages, and compresses are em- ployed, or straps that require frequent removal and reapplication. The patient suffers nothing compara- tively ; and the surgeon is saved much troublesome and dirty work,—for union by the first intention sel- dom fails. PART III. 2 a

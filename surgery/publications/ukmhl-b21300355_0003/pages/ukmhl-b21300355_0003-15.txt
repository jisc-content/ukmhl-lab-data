3 AFFECTIONS OF THE CHEST. Effusion of serum may take place into the cavities, attended with subsidence of the symptoms. In such circumstances, the lung collapses, either entirely, or still admitting a small quantity of air; and if the collection lodge for a considerable time, that side of the chest - enlarges. When the cavity is not quite full, the fluid is heard to be troubled; on motion of the trunk a sound of splashing is perceived. Part of the cavity may be occupied with air which has escaped from an opening in the lung ; or halitus may be extricated from the accumulated secretion. There are other signs, sufficiently distinct, imparting a know- ledge of such effusion. The previous history of the case leads to a shrewd suspicion. The chest is un- naturally immovable, as well as enlarged; the in- tercostal spaces are widened, and ultimately protu- berant ; there is dulness on percussion, and no respi- ratory murmur perceptible in those parts where there is fluid; the sounds are natural in that part of the lung which is permeable to air, and distended. Often suppuration is the result of the incited action ; and purulent matter forms in the cavity of the pleura, generally without breach of svirface. The membrane is covered with lymph, more or less extensively or- ganized. Empyema is established. Suppuration may take place in the substance of the lungs, and from ulceration the matter may escape, in small quantity at a time, into the bronchial tubes, giving relief to the patient; or it may be poured in profusely and suddenly so as to cause instant suffocation ; or it may work its way into the cavity of the pleura, and occupy

FRACTUllE OF THE OLECRANON. 283 cases accurate and careful manipulation is required. Displacement of one or other of the bones of the fore- arm almost uniformly attends this fracture, some- times rendering diagnosis obscure. Fracture of the olecranon process of the ulna is occasioned by falls on the point of the elbow ; or the bone may be snapped asunder by powerful and sudden action of the triceps extensor cubiti, when the arm is much and quickly bent. The injury is readily re- cognised ; there is inability to extend the forearm by its own muscular powers, a considerable space is felt between the separated portions of the bone, and the upper fragment is movable as well as detached; these marks of the injury are rendered more conspi- cuous by bending the joint. Crepitation is produced by moving the limb when extended, and the separated parts thereby approximated. Bloody swelling soon takes place, large and extensive when bruising of the soft parts has been greatâ€”and this is usually the case, in consequence of the injury being almost always the result of direct violence. In some cases the process is comminuted. Compound fracture is rare, and likely to be pro- ductive of serious consequences. I have treated and witnessed several cases. In one the process was cut off by the patient falling on an earthen vessel, which broke under the limb. The joint is necessarily open- ed. Violent inflammation soon commences, and can very seldom be kept within moderate bounds. Dis-

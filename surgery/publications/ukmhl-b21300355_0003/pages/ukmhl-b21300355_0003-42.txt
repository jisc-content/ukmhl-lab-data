It acts beneficially by inducing general relaxation, or even syncope, during which, whilst all resistance of the compressing powers upon the contents is suspended, pressure on the tumour can be employed to good advantage. By steady per- severance, whilst the patient is in the bath, a great majority of strangulated hernije may be reduced. But neither the general nor the local application of heat, or any other known means, save the edge of the knife, can relax tendinous apertures farther than can be effected by attention to position. Irrecoverable and most precious time may be wasted in preparing the bath, and for this reason such means should never be resorted to, unless they can be commanded at the shortest notice.

AMPUTATION AT THE SHOULDER-.TOINT. 385 against recurrence of the disease, the nerves were laid hold of, pulled outwards, and cut across as high as possible. The patient was relieved of many of his sufferings, and continued tolerably comfortable for nearly two years ; again, however, the painful symptoms have returned, though in a slighter degree. On examining the removed stump, all the nerves, particularly the musculo-spiral, were found greatly enlarged in their extremities, and intimately adhe- rent to the cicatrix and the ligamentous covering of the rounded extremtiy of the humerus. Amputation at the Shoulder-joint is more fre- quently required for accident than for disease. It has always been the custom to trust, for suppression of bleeding during this operation, to the hands of an assistant; and when the method has been found ef- fectual in the case of the large axillary artery, why object to it, on the score of inefficiency, in the minor amputations ? particularly when it is evident, put- ting efficiency out of the question, that it is prefer- able to compression by the tourniquet, or any other circular apparatusâ€”more quickly applied and relax- ed, less painful, less formidable, always ready, and independent of the instrument-maker? The com- pression is made above the clavicle, so as to secure the subclavian, where it passes over the first rib. The thumb of a steady assistant is placed deeply into the cavity of the lower triangular space of the neck, imme- diately above the first large sinuosity of the clavicle. The pressure thus made, is quite effectual; but as it TAUT III. 2 L

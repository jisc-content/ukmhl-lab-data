203 CALCULUS VESICA.. round stones of considerable size. The instrument is introduced shut, along the finger, and on reaching the prostate is gently insinuated, whilst the finger is at the same time withdrawn. It is brought in contact with the stone, and carefully opened, the handles being raised. One blade is passed under the stone, the other remaining above, and then the instrument is closed, firmly but not forcibly. By the finger, again introduced, along the side of the forceps, it is ascer- tained whether or not the stone is held securely, and in the proper direction ; if not all right, it may then be turned by using the point of the finger and relaxing the grasp. Now the handles of the instru- ment are depressed, so as to avoid resistance from the bones in the front of the pelvis, and the extrac- tion is commenced, steady and gradual; if difficult, dilation is effected, and the process so facilitated, by moving the forceps gently backwards and forwards; no force or violence is required, either in pulling or dilating; all should proceed smoothly and with deli- beration. The forceps must be proportioned in length to the size of the stone; a large concretion requires long forceps, both that it may be grasped securely, and that sufficient power may be affi^rded for the extrac- tion. Some stones are of such a size as will not admit of passage through the section of one side of the gland. By using the blunt-pointed knife, directed by the finger, without any additional external incision, a wound is made on the right side of the prostate, in

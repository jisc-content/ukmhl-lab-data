AiMPUTATION or THE FINGERS. 375 to tlie one about to be removed. The operator seats himself before the patient, grasps the finger so as to manage its movements with the left hand, and hold- ing the knife perpendicularly, with its point upwards, lays it over the knuckle, and carries it obliquely up- wards so as to open that side of the articulation. He then pushes the finger towards the opposite side, and with the point of the knife completes the loosen- ing of the articulation ; for this the blade of the in- strument should never be employed, otherwise the integument will be cross-cut and mangled. After separation of the base of the phalanx by the point, the blade is passed behind, and carrying it down- wards and outwards, a flap is formed similar to the firstâ€”both proportioned to the size of the wound which they are to cover, and the bone which they are to protect. They are retained in contact by bringing the neighbouring fingers towards each other. This also sufiices, in general, to suppress the bleed- ing, but sometimes one or both digital arteries re- quire ligature. At first cold cloths are probably the best applications, with the view of stopping the oozing, and warding off inflammatory action. Vas- cular excitement is very apt to follow this amputa- tion, when performed for disease of the finger, as after neglected or severe whitlow ; the soft parts in which the incisions are made are generally infiltrated and condensed, and prone to inflammation. The sur- face around is red, tense, and shining, on the second or third day; the back of the hand, the palm, and per- haps the forearm, are then involved in inflammation

STRICTURE OF THE URETHRA. 110 form in the scrotum and perineum, and through them foetid matter and urine will constantly and in- voluntarily distil. The patient is reduced to a miser- able state, the neighbouring parts are excoriated, and exhale a noisome odour, his body and bed are soaked and rotted by the discharge, and the atmosphere to! a considerable distance around offends the nostrils^ Fistula in peri?ieo is established. Ulceration and perforation of the urethra from stric- ture seldom takes place anteriorly to the scrotum ; but ulceration often is induced there by retaining instru- ments long in the passage, and may be followed by sloughing of the integuments, abscess in the cellular tissue, or both. Occasionally the urethra communi- cates with the rectum in consequence of ulceration, escape of urine into the cellular tissue, and formation of matter. The symptoms of stricture are often much relieved after the formation of fistulous open- ings ; and the cure can then be much more easily accomplished than formerly, the passage being less iiTitable. When the fistula is free and open, allow- ing the urine to escape readily, the natural passage contracts, and will become almost entirely obliterated, unless means are taken to dilate it, and to diminish the unnatural opening. Neglected aggravated cases are met with, in which the urine has passed entirely through the false passages for years, the urethra and penis, anterior to the stricture, being both rendered completely useless; but even such can, by proper management, be permanently cured. Ulceration of the urethra, originating in consequence of stricture,

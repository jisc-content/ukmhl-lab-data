FRACTURE OF THE PHALANGES. 287 should extend to the tips of the fingers, the inner need not pass the palm ; they are retained by a roller. In fracture of both bones, a wooden splint should be retained on the outside of the limb for a few hours ; but this precaution is scarcely required when but one has suffered. Similar treatment, along with attention to the wound, is required in compound fracture. The metacarpal hones and phalanges of thejinge?'s are subject to fractures, both simple and compound. The metacarpal bone supporting the little finger most frequently suffers from force applied to the knuckle, as in pugilistic encounters. The other metacarpal bones are occasionally broken from crushing of the hand, as by a heavy body falling on it, or by its be- coming entangled amongst machinery. The injury is readily ascertained by moving the fingers, and pressing in the course of the bone. On laying hold of the distal end of the bone suspected to have given way, placing the fingers over the shaft, and attempt- ing slight motion, distinct crepitation is perceived. For the cure, motion of the parts must be prevented for a sufficient time, and inflammation warded off when threatened ; there is little or no displacement, and consequently retentive apparatus can be almost wholly dispensed with. Simple fractures of the phalanges are recognised and treated by even the most unlearned in the sur- gical profession. The deformity is so striking as to render mistakes as to the nature of the accident im-

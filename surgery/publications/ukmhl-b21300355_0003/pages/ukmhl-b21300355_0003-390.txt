378 AMPUTATION OF THE FORE ARM. bistoury is passed round the bone throughout its whole extent,the edge being kept close to it,â€”in order that the soft parts may be separated, and that with- out unnecessary width of wound. Then the bone is clipped at the proper point by the cutting pliers ; or the section of the bone may be performed before separation of the soft parts from its under surface, as, by raising the cut end, this part of the operation may be facilitated. Here the metacarpal saw is in- applicable. Before quitting this part of the amputations, it may be observed, that no good can result from taking away a metacarpal bone and leaving a finger, or from removing a proximal phalanx and leaving the distal. The parts so left can be of no use, they have no sup- port, and no muscles or tendons ; they must prove an incumbrance, and as such will either form the subject of a second amputation, or remain a proof of the un- successful result of the first. Amputation in the forearm may be necessary at various points, on account of accident or disease, but should never be resorted to, in either case, so long as part of the hand can be saved. The preservation of even a small portion of this useful member is of great importance to the patient. When, however, this is hopeless, all must be removed; and if the wrist be sound, amputation may be performed at that joint. Hitherto, no mention has been made of the temporary suppression of bleeding, for in the amputations detail- ed there is scarcely ever any necessity for adopting such measures; but in those of the forearm and ami, a

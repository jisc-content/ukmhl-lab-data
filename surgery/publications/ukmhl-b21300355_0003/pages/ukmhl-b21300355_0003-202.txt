In the adult, it cannot be adopted with safety and propriety, when the bladder is irritable and will not bear a certain degree of distension, and when the prostate gland is large. The cases in which the con- cretion is small, soft, or brittle, and the parts sound and free from irritation, form but a small proportion of those labouring under stone who present themselves to an operating surgeon. However, the bruising, grinding, and rubbing down of stones has been tried in all kinds of cases, but with neither a satis- factory nor an encouraging result; a case will now and then be met with favourable to these proceed- ings, but they can never become generally applicable, and attempts to make them so will, as experience has shown, be followed by disappointment and disaster. A stone of a larger size than I have indicated, and of dense structure, may be laid hold of in the blad- der, and may by repeated and tedious operations be broken into fragments ; but each sitting, as it is called, of the patient, and each attack upon the stone, is attended with more pain, greater risk, and far more exhaustion, than its removal by incision would inflict. The repeated introduction of the instruments, their expansion, and the turning of them about in the bladder, and, if their object is accomplished, the action of the angular and rough surfaces of the frag- ments on the mucous coat, are certainly followed by

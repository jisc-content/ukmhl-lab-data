HYDROCELE. 164 for injection of the tunica vaginalis is incompatible with diseased testicle—the fluid is drawn off by means of a round trocar. The canula is left in the wound, and to it is adapted the nozzle of a brass stop-cock attached to a small elastic bottle. By means of these instruments the wine is injected in sufficient quan- tity to distend the tunic moderately, taking care that the extremity of the canula is completely within the cavity, otherwise the cellular tissue will be injected, and violent inflammation ensue, terminating in un- healthy suppuration and sloughing. By turning the cock, the wine is retained until the patient begin to feel pain shooting upM^ards to the loins, when it is to be evacuated. He may not feel any uneasiness, however, and then it will be necessary to draw off the fluid and inject a fresh quantity. If this, too, fail, a more stimulating fluid must be used, a solution of sulphate of zinc, spirits and water, or pure ardent spirits. It is supposed that this treatment is effectual by inducing adhesive inflammation, and obliteration of the cavity by adhesion of the tunica vaginalis to the tunica albuginea ; but this is erroneous. There may in some cases be a little lymph deposited, but in general there is not. The excitement following injection seems to change the action in the parts without altering their structure or relation—to re- establish the healthy balance between the exhalants and absorbents. Its first effect is to produce increase of swelling from fresh effusion into the cavity of the tunica vaginalis, accompanied with redness of the integument and considerable pain—sometimes with

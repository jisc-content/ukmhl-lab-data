AFFECTIONS OF THE CHEST. 4 the same place as if it had been secreted by that membrane. Or again, if the lung adhere to the costal pleura, the matter may approach the surface of the body, by the aid of interstitial absorption of the intervening parts, and the collection may then be opened like a common superficial abscess, by division of the integuments only. When the pleura is full, the chest enlarges, the in- teguments become oedematous ; and if, from the pre- ceding and collateral circumstances, no doubt exist of the presence of matter, paracentesis may be per- formed with a chance of relieving and saving the patient. The patient is placed horizontally, with the shoulders slightly elevated; and the affected side should be as dependent as possible, that he may be readily turned over on his face should the breathing become embarrassed. The position of the diaphragm, in regard to the inner surface of the false and lower true ribs, must be kept in view. Wlien the disten- sion is great, this important muscle is displaced; it is pushed downwards, carrying before it the viscera in the upper part of the abdomen ; it is thus removed far from the place at which the incision is usually made. The point of election, as it is called, is between the fifth and sixth ribs, and midway between the ster- num and the spine. An incision is made through the integuments, over the upper edge of the sixth rib, an inch and a half in extent; in this situation there is no risk of wounding the intercostal artery. If the operator intend to shut the cavity as soon as the fluid has been discharged, the integuments are

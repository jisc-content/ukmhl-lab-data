By care and attention in applying the apparatus, and in adjusting the cushions about the ankle and peri- neum, there is little or no risk of the skin giving way. The bandages will require to be re-applied once or twice during the cure, and the perineal band should be tightened frequently. The apparatus is retained for six or eight weeks, the time necessary for union varying according to circumstances.

The same apparatus is the most effectual for all fractures of the thigh ; but those near the distal ex- tremity, and in the lower third of the bone, may be managed easily and well on the double inclined planeâ€”M'Intyre's splint, the thigh-piece of which is double, the one portion sliding on the other, and made to shorten and lengthen by means of a screw, without removal from the patient. To this the limb is secured by bandaging from the toes upwards ; the upper bandage, which should be broad, being con- tinued close to the perineum, and then passed several times round the loins.

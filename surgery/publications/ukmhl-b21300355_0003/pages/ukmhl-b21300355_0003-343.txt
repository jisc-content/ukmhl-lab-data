LUXATION or THE ELROW-.TO I NT. fi'il duction. The frequent occurrence of such blunders is the more lamentable, as it is almost impossible to replace the bones after three or four weeks ; indeed, I have been foiled at the end of two weeks. The parts soon accommodate themselves to their new position, the olecranon process shortens, motion ra- pidly increases, and the bones get more and more secure in their new relations,â€”osseous matter being deposited laterally, forming cavities for their lodge- ment, and new ligamentous matter confining them thereto. After a time, flexion can be made to a right angle ; and the limb becomes tolerably useful. By unsuccessful attempts to restore the natural position, inflammation is excited ; and thus the salutary pro- cesses, commenced by nature for reparation of the dis- placement, are interrupted and delayed; in young persons such disease of the joint maybe produced as will lead to loss of the extremity. Luxation of the Radius alone, backwards on the outer condyle, is sometimes met with ; but this bone is seldom singly displaced far from its original site. A hollow is felt below the end of the humerus, on the outer and fore part, and there is a corresponding prominence behind ; the head of the bone is found unnaturally movable on rotation, and this motion is difficult and painful; the arm is extended, present- ing a twisted appearance, and flexion is very limited. Extension is to be made, along with pronation. Sometimes the radius is displaced forwards. The coronoid process of the ulna is occasionally broken off"; there is no deformity during flexion of the elbow,

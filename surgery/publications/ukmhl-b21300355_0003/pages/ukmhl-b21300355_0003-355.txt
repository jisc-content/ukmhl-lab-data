LUXATION OF THE HIP-JOINT. 343 trochanter was not so much depressed as in luxation downwards. By cross-examination it was discovered that the patient had halted in walking for many weeks previously, had felt as if the limb was longer than the other, had pain in the groin and knee ; in fact, morbus coxarius had been advancing, and the pain, immobility, and greater elongation had been oc- casioned by the fall, causing violent excitement of the morbid action previously in progress. Dreadful con- sequences must have resulted from mistake in diag- nosis and practice founded upon it. I have observed, in other cases, great and rapid elongation of the limb in consequence of injury to the hip-joint previously diseased. The reduction is in many cases difficult. In young and muscular individuals, after the lapse of some hours, when reaction has occurred, the muscles are rigidly contracted, and the head of the bone is not easily dislodged. Extension, made to a certain ex- tent and continued, is not so useful or essential here as in other forms of luxation of this joint. Adduc- tion, carrying the injured thigh quickly and forcibly over the other, is generally successful; and the reduc- tion is favoured by at the same time raising up the neck of the bone, by means of a towel or wooden roller passed under the upper part of the thigh. There is also no such advantage from rotating the bone as in other luxations. It is very often neces- sary, even in recent cases, to adopt measures to weaken muscular exertions; and again, in cases of three weeks' duration, I have found no difficulty.

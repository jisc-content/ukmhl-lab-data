228 STRICTUKE OF VAGINA. seldom any risk of the parts again coalescing ; when the obstruction, however, is unusually thick, the in- sertion of dressing between the edges during granu- lation may be necessary to prevent contraction. Unnatural adhesions of the external labia occa- sionally take place, occurring in early life from the healing of excoriation and ulceration caused by ne- glect of cleanliness. Perhaps the closure is not to such an extent as to prevent escape of the discharges, but still it is inconvenient and requires attention. The parts must be divided in the proper direction and to the necessary extent, and by the interposition of dressing reclosure is prevented. Coiitraction of the vagina at a distance from the orifice sometimes occurs. On one occasion I was requested by an accoucheur to examine and divide a very tight, firm stricture, scarcely admitting the finger. Labour had commenced, and the expulsion of the fcetus was prevented by the stricture ; it was attributed to injury inflicted in a former delivery. By a probe-pointed bistoury guided on the finger, it was notched pretty deeply at many pointsâ€”a pro- ceeding which I have followed with advantage in simple stricture of the rectum. Every thing pro- ceeded happily. Occasionally the contraction of the vagina is to a great extent; the uterine discharges are not per- mitted to exist at all, and great uneasiness is thereby occasioned. In one case in which the canal may be said to have been wholly obliterated, from what cause or at what period it did not distinctly appear, I

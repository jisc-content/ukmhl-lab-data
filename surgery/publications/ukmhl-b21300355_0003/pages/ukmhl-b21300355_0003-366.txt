354 SPRAIN. are more frequently injured, and in the lower oftener than in the upper. I have seen the tendon of the biceps torn in violent exertion. In the thigh, too, some fibres occasionally give way from a similar cause. The supra-muscular fascia in the arm and thigh is apt to give way at one or more points during powerful exertion of the muscles, causing deformity by protrusion of muscle through the torn space. But it is in the apparatus for extending the foot, and raising the weight of the body, that laceration of tendon most frequently takes place. The accident is uncommon till after the middle period of life, when the body has become heavier, when muscular exer- tions have been less habitually practised, and when the fibre has grown more rigid. The person in raising himself over some slight obstruction in walk- ing, perhaps attempting to pass a small ditch or stile, suddenly " breaks down." Or in dancing,— an amusement which he has long discontinued—a sudden snap is felt, with immediate lameness and slight pain in the back of the limb ; swelling and discoloration follow ; and these symptoms vary in intensity according to the extent of the injury. Lace- ration may have been slight; the pain, swelling, and lameness are proportional, and at first an inconsider- able void can be felt at the upper part of the tendi- nous termination of the gastrocuemii. Sometimes no change is perceptible, and in such cases some have been of opinion that the slender tendon of the plan- taris has given way and caused the lameness; but this is doubtful, and it seems more probable that stretching and yielding has taken place in some pari

FllACTURE OF THE FEMUR. 296 terposed betwixt its ends. There is also difficulty in jDerforming accurate adaptation of the broken ends, and in securing retention so long as is necessary for union ; the limb has a tendency to retraction ; in readjusting the apparatus, when become loose, the broken surfaces are rubbed on each other, and thus any union which may have been in progress is inter- fered with. In consequence of all this, union seldom takes place by bone ; it has occurred, and will occur, in favourable cases and under good treatment; but it is an undeniable fact, that the circumstances which of a necessity follow fracture at this point are inimi- cal to its effective reparation. The broken ends are sometimes united by fibrous tissue. Most frequently no union takes place, and the broken surfaces gra- dually become smooth and adapted to each other; a false joint is formed, but at the same time the capsu- lar ligament, and tissues exterior to it, are thickened and strengthened, and so the unnatural motion is limited. The rough and irregular portions of the bone are absorbed, and the neck of the femur, from interstitial absorption, almost disappears; its head lies attached to the cotyloid cavity, and is rubbed upon by the ojDposed surface of the shaft. Shortening of the limb is an inevitable result, and at first the power of motion is slight, and the support afibrded to the body weak; in course of time the member becomes strong and useful. Many bones are preserved and exhibited, in which fracture of the neck of the thigh-bone, with bony union, is supposed to have taken place ; but there are

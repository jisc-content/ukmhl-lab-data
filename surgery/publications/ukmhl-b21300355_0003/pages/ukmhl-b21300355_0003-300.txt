288 FRACTURE OF THE PELVIS. possible; reduction is accomplished without difficul- ty; and the bones are kept in their proper places by a small splint, either of wood or pasteboard, placed on each side of the finger, and retained by a narrow roller. Compound fractures of the phalanges are almost uniformly followed by most violent inflammatory action in all the tissues, terminating in disease of the joints, and in death of the tendinous and fibrous tissues. The suppuration is profuse and unhealthy, and the infiltration of the soft parts extensive. The diseased action not unfrequently pervades the palm of the hand. In the great majority of cases, necessity for amputation arrives sooner or later. Fracture of the bones composing the pelvis occa- sionally takes place, but can be produced only by the application of great force, as by a loaded vehicle passing over the body, or by falls from a great height. The accident is usually attended with serious injury of the viscera contained in the pelvic cavity, or in that of the abdomen; they may be either ruptured, or lacerated by sharp projecting spicula?, or merely bruised. The nature and extent of the injury is not easily ascertained. There is great pain on motion of the body or of the limbs, and usually extensive ex- travasation of blood in the soft parts ; these circum- stances, along with the symptoms that may arise from internal organs which have been injured, and a know- ledge of the way in which the injury was inflicted, lead to a strong suspicion of fracture of the pelvis.

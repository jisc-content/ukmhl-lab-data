298 FRACTUIIE OF THE FEMUR. little, if any, chance of union. In these cases, the ap- plication of apparatus with the view of adapting and retaining the parts, is productive of great annoyance, and is apt to produce either ulceration or sloughing of the integuments at various parts ; and confine- ment to one constrained position for a considerable time has a mischievous effect on the general health. Instead, the limb is placed in the easiest posture, either extended and slightly retained, or bent over a double inclined plane formed by pillows, with the knee of the affected side fixed to the opposite ; a broad band is passed round the trochanters and pelvis, so as to restrain motion without causing inconve- nience ; and when pain about the thigh is trouble- some, fomentation may be used. After some weeks, when the uneasy feelings have subsided, the position is changed, the patient is set up, and encouraged to move about, supporting the weight of the body upon crutches. In more favourable subjects, whether the fracture is suspected to be without or within the joint, either entirely or partially, the broken surfaces are to be brought in contact, and retained immovably in appo- sition for a time sufficient to admit of union. The limb is put up in apparatus not requiring removal, and but little re-adjustment. This can be effected only in the extended position. Many splints, with foot-boards, straps, and screws, are intended for this purpose, some to be attached to the injured limb, others to the sound one ; but the apparatus which is

[CONTINUED.] CHAPTER XLII. —t— DISEASES OF ARTERIES. ARTEBITIS. Acute Arteritis of an idiopathic character, unconnected with traumatic lesion, is a disease that has probably been more frequently described than seen. Its very existence is indeed by many considered to be doubtful, and its causes, phenomena, and symptoms are still unsolved pathological problems. Subacute and Chronic Arteritis is famihar to every Sm’geon in con- nection with the contusion, laceration, wound and ligatiu’e of arteries ; for it is by that process that, under the varying circumstances of injiuy or of surgical operation for the arrest of haemorrhage, these vessels are ultimately and securely plugged and obliterated. For a description of these processes, the reader is referred to Yol. I., Chap. XIV. Both the coats of the artery and the contained blood undergo important changes in this disease. It becomes often very difficult to dissociate one of these pathological conditions from the other, and to determine in which the primary departiu’e hum a normal state is to be found, except in those cases in which the arteritis arises from real traumatic causes, which necessarily fall under the observation of the Surgeon, and which serve to him as typical cases by which to study the other and primarily less distinctly marked instances of the disease. Formerly pathologists described two distinct forms of arteritis, viz., the Diffuse or Erysipelatous, and the Limited, Plastic, or Adhesive; and this idew has hitherto been adopted in this work. But more recent investi- gations have led to considerable doubt as to the existence of the diffuse or erysipelatous form of the disease. The symptoms with ivhich it was supposed to be coimccted are probably in reality dependent on some of the various foms of blood-poisoning ; and the pathological appearances that were believed to be indications of its existence are now generally held to be the result of changes in the blood, either during life or shortly after death, giving rise to "vaiious pseudo-morbid appearances produced by simple imbibition or staining of the arterial coats, causing them to become soddened, softened, and variously discoloured. Embolic Arteritis may arise from two distinct sets of causes ;2 DISEASES OF ARTERIES. one operating directly on tliio coats of the artery itself, the other influencing them indirectly by inducing changes in the contained blood. To the firsl belong traumatic causes of all kinds, as the bruising, laceration, division, or ligature of the vessel, and others that more slowly influence it, as the implica- tion and consolidation of its coats in and by the growth and pressure of neigh- bouring tumours. To the second set of causes, those that act on the coats through the medium of the contained blood, belong blood-changes induced by gout, rheumatism, syphilis, &c. In the simplest form, arising for instance from the pressm-e of a tumour upon an artery, the coats become thickened, and are fused together, as it were, so as to form an impervious cord ; in the more acute forms of the disease, the sheath and more especially the external coat become pulpy and vascular, with effusion of exudation-matter in and around them. The middle coat does not seem to undergo any primary change, but after a time becomes contracted, thickened, and somewhat softened. The internal coat becomes softened, pulpy, and stained by imbibition of the colour- ing matter of the blood. In consequence of these changes in the coats, the vessel loses its elasticity, and becomes softened and brittle. After the inflammation has existed a short time, a or thrombus is deposited in the diseased part of the artery. This plug assumes two distinct forms. It may be deposited as a membranous layer of decolorised fibrine, usually thin, but sometimes ac- cumulated in masses, occluding the orifices of collateral branches (Fig. 348); but most fi’equently it is deposited in the form of a conical plug, which com- pletely Ifiocks up the vessel at the part inflamed, below which the calibre of the artery is somewhat contracted (Fig. 344). The plug or thrombus is formed of Fig. 343.—Tiiromi)osis of two distinct materials. The middle and lower parts consist of a mass of a yellowish or reddish colour, composed of inflammatory exudation-matter, intenningled with fibrine deposited upon it by the circulating blood, and adhering firmly to the contiguous walls of the vessel. The upper portion of the plug is black, and consists of simple coagulum, deposited upon and tailing on to the decolorised mass ; it is usually long, narrow, and stringy, and is not ad- herent to the sides of the vessels. The plug may continue per- manently to block up the artery, which gradually contracts upon vxir it so as to be eventually converted into a fibro-cellular cord ; or im-y Artery, ocou- it may ])e partly absorbed or channelled through the centre ; or lastly, it may be entirely removed by absorption, the calibre of the vessel being freely restored. These plugs may continue attacl.ed to thePLASTIC ARTERITIS. 3 part of tlic artevy in whicli tliey have originally formed ; or they may be primarily deposited in one ot the larger arteries, the aoita, oi e\en the left ca\-ities of the heart, and thence be washed by the current of the blood into one of the secondary arteries, becoming aiTcstcd at some point of bifurcation or narrowing of the vessel, as the termination of the common femoral or popliteal in the lower extremity or the axillary in the upper, and, there blocking up the ■\’csscl, occasion sudden gangrene of the limb. When thus broken up and circulating they form einhola (Vol. I., p. 721). If one of these embola be driven into a visceral artery, structm-al changes in the part supphed by the vessel Awll necessarily ensue ; and if the organ be one immediately essential to life, as the brain, instantaneous death may be the consequence of this plugging of one of its arteries by a fibrinous mass formed at and carried from a distant part of the arterial system. The subjects of plastic arteritis and of emboKsm are so intimately asso- ciated that it becomes in the highest degree difficult to separate them, and in many cases, when an arteiy is plugged by a plastic mass with imbibition of and effusion into its coats, to say whether the fibrine of the blood has become adherent to and almost incorporated with the coats of the vessel in conse- quence of primary changes of an inflammatory nature taking place in them ; or whether the converse has been the case, and the primary change has taken place in the blood, the alterations in structure in the arterial walls being . secondaiy to these. But it is not easy to understand how or why impure or diseased blood should select one particular limited patch or spot in the arterial system upon which to deposit its coagulum or fibrine, unless there have pre- ■\iously been such changes of structure, inflammatory or otherwise, at this point of the ai-terial walls as to dispose the blood to stasis at this point, and to deposit of adherent blood-clot on the inner coat of the artery. In the ab- sence, therefore, of any such structural changes as atheroma or calcification of the coats of the vessel itself, it is more than probable that a primary change of an inflammatory character has been set up there, in consequence of which the thrombosis and subsequent embohsm have resulted as secondarv consequences. The changes that take place in the arteiy at some localised spot may commence either in the external or in the internal coat of the vessel. The Surgeon is familiar with both these as starting-points for plastic arteritis. Thus, if an a,rtery be contused (Vol. I., p. 2G5) in an external wound, the inflammatory iiTitation in which it participates in common with the other injured stincturcs may determine the thrombosis of the vessel. The same ^\ill happen in cases in which an artery has been cut down upon and exposed without being tied, or where a temporary ligature has been used. Plastic arteritis as a consequence of inflammatory action, beginning in the inner coat, is of daily occiUTeiice in surgical practice, when a large artery has been tied (Vol. I., p. 294). ^ Any external agency, then, that is sufficient to produce inflammation in the external or intcnial coats of an artery, will be sufficient to determine in the artery that condition in virtue of which the blood circulating throuo-h it de- posits Its fibrine upon its lining membrane at the seat of injury, and thus the foundation of a thrombosis.4 DISEASES OF ARTERIES. Secondary Eeeects oe Arteritis.—These are of great importance. Arctation, or even complete occlusion, of the artery not unfrequently occurs, as a consequence of inflammation of the vessel. This usually results from chronic arteritis, often excited by the pressure of a tumour or by some other local irritant. As it is usually a slow process, there is abundant time for the anastomosing circulation to be set up : so that the vitality of the limb or part supplied by the diseased vessel is preserved. The artery that has been so narrowed and closed, ultimately becomes converted into a fibro-ceUular cord up to the nearest collateral branch, just as if it had been occluded by a ligature. The thrombosis which renders the vessel impervious by obliterating it, may in some cases give rise to gangrene of the parts supplied. This is especially apt to occur if the arteritis be acute, if the patient be aged, or if the plug be so situated as to occlude some of the principal anastomosing branches, so that there may not be time or opportunity for the collateral circulation to establish itself. In other cases, fibrine may not only be deposited at the part inflamed, but may, in the form of embola, be carried lower down than the original seat of disease, and thus accumulate in the terminal branches of the artery. The vessel will thus be obstructed at two points, between which a pernous part will be included. This double occlusion of the vessel, I beheve, renders gangrene of the limb ine'^dtable ; at least, in all those cases in which I have seen mortification result from arteritis, this condition has existed. The fibrine poured out at the inflamed point may in some cases be carried on through the terminal branches of the vessel into the capillaries, and thus may form buflp-coloured deposils in various organs, especially in the spleen. In other cases, the arteries and capillaries of a tract of tissue being thus plugged by embola, the blood in the veins leading from the part will coagulate ; and this coagulation, spreading into veins beyond the part primarily affected, vdU cause thrombosis of some larger veins. Should a piece of the thi’ombus projecting into a vein become detached, it will be carried on in the circulation until arrested at some point, as in the lungs, or, being aiTested in and obstruct- ing a venous tnnik, it may give rise to so-called phlebitis. Symptoms.—The liocal Symptoms of arteritis depend not only on the con- dition of the vessel itself, but on that of the parts which it supplies. The most marked are pain ; some tension and'stiffness of the affected limb ; a good deal of tenderness ; and a cord-like feehng along the inflamed vessel, in which also a jerking and forcible pulsation can be felt. The pain below the part of the artery that is inflamed, is ahvays very severe, and is distinctly of two kinds superficial and deep. The superficial pain is seated in the skin, which is exces- sively sensitive to the touch, so that the patient cannot bear the finger to be laid upon it, just as is the case in neinalgia ; it is smarting and pricking,^and, is, I believe, always associated with more or less loss of muscular power. The deep pain is bimiing and lancinating, and not only follows the com'se of the ^ essels, but strikes through the limb in different directions. If the inflamed part of the vessel lie not completely occluded by the plastic plug deposited in it, the pulsation in the arteries of the limb, below the seat of the disease, may continue much as usual; but in the majority of cases the pulsation ceases m all the vessels on the distal side of the inflamed spot, and the limb gradually5 STRUCTURAL DISEASES OF ARTERIES. loses its temperature, becoming of a dark or Inud colour, and cold; yet the inordinate sensibility of the surface continues. As the (jarujrem advances, however, this is lost; the parts, at the time that they lose their sensibility, assuming the ordinary character of dry, shrivelled, or mummified gangrene, until all indications of vitality cease. If, however, the veins be plugged, as well as the arteries, the dark moist variety of mortification wiU result. In this way some of the cases of so-called “ spontaneous gangrene ” are occasioned (Vol. I. p. 6G1). . . . The Spontaneous Gangrene resulting from arteritis may occur in the upper as well as in the lower extremities, and is not unfrequently met with in young people. In most of the cases which I have seen, it has occurred in individuals under the age of thirty. When it is the result of pm’e arteritis, independent of any other structural afiection of the coats of the vessel, the gangrene most commonly occurs in the upper extremity. Arteritis, however, is by no means necessarily followed by mortification ; the liability to the loss of vitality depends on the seat of the inflammation, being greater when it takes place ill the neighboiu'hood of the large collateral trunks of the limb, and when it is of an acute character, so that the anastomosing circulation has not time to establish itself. It also ocem’s more frequently when the arteritis is idiopathic than when it is traumatic ; as then a larger extent of vessel is plugged, and there is a greater tendency to the occlusion of the collateral branches, which are necessary to the preservation of the vitahty of the limb. The embolism of the terminal branches, by the plastic matter poured out at the seat of inflammation and washed down into the lower part of the limb, is a frequent cause of gangrene. STRUCTURAL DISEASES OP ARTERIES. An artery may be the seat of various Structural Lesions, which play an important part, not only in giving rise to ulterior diseases in the vessel itself, but in disposing to various affections of the organs which it supplies. If we look upon an artery as a tube composed of tissues that differ largely in their organisation and structure, we must necessarily consider their diseases to be equally 'v aried ; and we shall find that, whilst the changes which take place in the external coat, in which the whole , of the vital or nutritive activity of the vessel resides, are chiefly conservative, those that have their seat in the internal and middle coats have a destructive tendency. This important difference in the character of the diseases of the coats of the vessel, is dependent on the relative degrees of vascularity and of vitality possessed by these structures. The diseases of the internal coat are the most interesting in a pathological point of view ; those of the external coat in a practical one. The coats of an artery are liable to the following changes :—1. Plastic Deposit on and under the lining 'membrane ; 2. Fatty and Granular Degene- ration ; and 3. Calcification. 1. Plastic Deposits on the free surface are of a fibrino-albuminous cha- racter, occurring in the form of rounded, semi-transptu’ent, and glistening masses, usually met with in the aorta or larger arteries around the mouths of their secondary vessels, or of ancurismal sacs—not unfrequently appearing to be agglomerated on calcareous spicula, and attaining great thickness. They6 OF AliTElUES. arc almost structureless, gelatinous, sometimes rosy-lookiug, and cut Avitli a hard cartilaginous section. This plastic deposit appears to come mostly from the circulating blood, to simulate, when membranous, so closely in structure to the lining membrane of the artery as scarcely to be recognisable from it, and not to be an inflammatory product. The plastic deposits ou the attached sur- face of the lining membrane are opaque, semi-transparent, yellowish-white, elastic but hard masses, composed essentially of plastic matter -with some oily globules intermixed. These are subinflammatory. 2. Fatty ajtd GrRAJfULAU Degenbratioxs.—These are of the most in- teresting character, and play an important part in arterial diseases. They occur under the different forms of Atheroma, either in the arterial coats them- selves, or in the plastic deposits upon or underneath them. Charactei'.—The atheromatous deposits occin- in very different forms, accord- ing to their age, &c. Their fii'st appearance is in the shape of fine white opaque streaks, situated in the substance of the fining membrane of the artery. As such, they are most commonly met with in the upper part of the arch of the aorta and in the neighbourhood of the orifices of the large arterial trunks ; especially along that part of the vessel from which the intercostals arise. Here they may be seen at a very early age. I have met with them in children of three, five, or seven years old. As the disease advances, these streaks aggi’egate together so as to form a large, white, and opaque patch. The middle coat now becomes thinned by the pressm-e of the patch, and, from being yellow and elastic, is altered into a grey, semi-transparent, and inelastic membrane, which often becomes stained by imbibition Avith Ifiood, and presents a condition which corresponds to the “ steatomatous deposit ” of Scarpa and Hodgson. In the third stage the patch softens, becoming converted into a pultaceous or cheesy mass, and eA’en sometimes undergoing complete liquefaction into a yellow creamy flifid, which has often been mistaken for true pus. These changes will be found to be mainly dependent on the abundant formation in it of fat- globules and scales of cholesterine. The softened atheromatous patch will be found to be situated in a kind of pouch or depression in the internal or middle coats of the artery, usually of a more or less oval shape. At the same time Avhen the changes just described are going on in the coats of the vessel, an important alteration is taking place in the connection between the internal and middle coats at the edge of the atheromatous patch ; here they become firmly incorporated together by inflammatory action, so that the one cannot be peeled away from the other, and the diffusion of the softened atheroma betAveen the tAVO membranes is arrested. Thus also, when the internal coat is completely eroded, and when the atheroma is washed aAvay by the cm-rent of the circulation, the infiltration of the blood between it and the middle coat and out of the pouch thus formed in the walls of the artery is prevented. These changes in the internal and middle coats of the vessel ai-c destructive, and tend to its ruptme ; but, coiucidently Avith these, the external coat bccoines thickened and indm-ated by the deposit of plastic exudative material, Avhich becomes developed into connective tissue, thus strengthening the softened and weakened artery by the formation of a new layer of tough and firm tissue ou its outside. It is especially opposite the deeper and more eroded atheromatous7 ATHEROMA. patches that this consolidation of the external coat takes place, thus preventing the perforation of the artery in this situation. This change, which is un- doubtedly inflammatory, is strictly conservative. The new deposit is not confined to the external coat of the artery, but extends to the sheath of the vessel, and, by soldering it to the contained artery, greatly adds to the strength of the A'ascular walls. Thus in these diseased arteries a process of repair or rather of strengthening takes place in two directions. In the interior of the vessel the lymph-masses that ai-e deposited there act as breakwaters lessening the force of the impulse of the blood against, and directing its current away from, weakened parts of the ai'terial walls ; whilst these in their turn are strengthened from without by the consolidation and thickening and incoi’poration of the external coat and sheath by exudative material. Atheroma essentially consists, as Avas first pointed out by Gulliver, of a fritty and grauulai- disintegration of the arterial coats ; the transformation into fatty and granidar matter taking place both in old fibrinous deposits upon and in the internal and fining membrane itself. The atheroma when fully formed 'consists of gTanules, oil-globules, and cholesterine, in various proportions Figs. 345, 34G), the plates of cholesterine being largest and most abnndant in those cases in which the atheroma is the softest (Fig. 347). The primary seat of the changes is the fining membrane of the vessel, in the outer layer of Avhich, corresponding to Henle’s fenestrated coat, they are fii’st met Avith, as I have often obsei’A^ed, after macerating and dissecting diseased arteries. That atheroma consists essentially in a fatty and granrdar degeneration of a portion of the arterial wall there can be no doubt. With this degeneration inflammatory products are found associated. The questions have hence arisen. Is atheroma the result of the inflammatory action that has given rise to these pioducts ? Or is the atheromatous degeneration the primary disease, and the evidences of inflammation secondary to it ? Fig, 345.—Fatty Deiiosit in Internal Coat. I' ig. <HG.—Early Stage of Atlieroiiia, The older patbologists, judging of softened atheroma simply from the naked eye eharacters and appearances, looked upon it as a kind o pVand e?et d presence to a pre-existing maammation.

More modern observers have confirmed Gulliver’s view of the essential character of fully formed atheroma, but incline to the opinion that its formation is preceded by change in the arterial coats of an inflammatory character, or at all events by such changes as lead to the develop- ment of proliferating connective tissue cells. Vir- chow and Billroth in Germany, and Moxon in this country, have particularly insisted on the pre- or co-existence of such changes in and with athero- matous deposits. It would be altogether beyond the scope of a practical work such as this, to enter at length into the discussion of so purely a pathological question. But, as it has important bearings on the early stages of aneurism, it may be briefly considered. Much will depend on what is meant by atheroma. English Siu’geons have applied this term to those changes that have just been described at whatevef age and under Avhatever circumstances they occiu-. If we adhere to this definition of atheroma, we shall find that it presents itself under two forms. One is sometimes found in very young subjects on the surface of the inner coat. In this the deeper layers of the internal coat are not affected, and the change appears to be simply one of fatty degeneration, usually to a very limited extent, Avithout the previous occuiTence or the coexistence of any inflammatory action or the development of any product of such action. In the other and more usual form of atheroma, we meet with much more extensive changes of structure in the arterial tissues ; and it is to this form of the disease that the descriptions of those pathologists who advocate the inflam- matory origin of atheroma more especially apply. In these cases the inner coat becomes greatly thickened and swollen in patches, presenting a bluish-grey semi-opaline appearance in some parts; in others, patches and streaks of a dull yellow or buff-coloured atheromatous deposit. On making a transverse section of an artery thus affected, the external and middle coats will be found healthy; but the inner coat, healthy in some parts, becomes greatly thickened in others. This thickening—sclerosis—is due to a free proliferation of connective tissue cells with increase of the fibroid material. These cells in the deeper layers become transformed into little masses of oil-granules, which, by their sub- sequent disintegration, give rise to a pulpy debris of large and small oil- globules floating in an albuminous fluid and containing crystals of cholestcrine (Fig. 347). The deepest layers of the inner coat adjoining the middle coat are also very granular, but not wholly broken up ; and the granular change may even extend slightly into the nearest layers of the middle coat. The accompanying diagram (Fig. 348), for which I am indebted to the kndness of H. Arnott, illustrates these conditions well. Moxon, after a careful study of atheroma, comes to the conclusion that it is essentially a subinflammation in various degi'ees of the arterial coats the lower degrees ending in fatty degeneration both of coat and of inflanunatory product.

They partake of the general character of the syphilitic gummata, and are most commonly met with in the large vessels. They involve the external coat, or may be deposited in plastic masses on the lining membrane. Effects.—The most important consequence of these changes in the structure of the artery is the eifect produced upon its vital properties. Instead of being an elastic resilient tube, reacting on the contained blood and serAung to regulate its distribution, it becomes inelastic, and consequently either gradually dilates in its calibre imder the influence of the outward pressime of the blood contained within it, forming perhaps an aneurism ; or, being incapable of regulating the distribution of the \ital fluid, tends to impair the supply to the organs to which it leads, and thus may occasion impairment of nutrition leading to softening, disintegration, or mortification. 3. Calcification of Arteeies comes next in order of frequency to their fatty disintegration. This change consists in the deposit in their coats of a quantity of hard and gritty earthy and saline matters, which, though commonly called osseous, present none of the true characters of bone—no trace of bone- corpuscles or of vascular canals being ever traceable in them. Microscopical examination shows them to consist of an irregular crystalline granular mass, without any evidence of organisation, composed, according to Lassaigne, of 50 parts of animal matter, 47^ of the phosphate, and 2 of the carbonate of lime in every 100. This calcification of the arterial coats is closely allied to atheroma; and indeed it would appear to have the same starting-point in many cases at least; the new growth preceding the atheroma having undergoneI>ISEASES OE AliTElUES. calcareous instead of fatty degeneration. The deposit always takes place in the first instance in minute sabulous grains or granules ; these after a time coalesce, assuming different forms according to the seat of the deposit and the age of the individual. Laminar Deposit.—This is the most frequent, and is principally met Avith in the lai-ger arteries, such as the aorta, the iliac, and the carotid. In this variety, calcareous masses and plates of various sizes, from a grain-like sand to a shell-like plate an inch in width, are met with in these vessels. The thick- ness of the patch varies from that of silver paper to two or three lines. The shape is elliptic or tri- angular, the largest diameter being in the direction of the axis of the vessel. The edge of the plate is ragged, rough, and uneven, and the surface smooth and incm’vated towards the cavity of the artery; if large, it is usually fissured or cracked, and surrounded by much atheroma. These patches are situated in the longitudmal fibrous coat, and are chiefly deposited where this structiwe abounds, as at the arch of the aorta, the bifiu’cation of the iliacs, and in the carotid arteries. The inner coat is usually thjekened and opaque where it covers the patch, and the middle much thinned and Fig. 340.— wasted. citicatioii.‘ Annular Calcification principally occiu’S in arteries of the third magnitude, such as the pop- liteal and the femoral. It commences by the deposit of , „ - I, 1 • 1 ^ -> 350.—Tubular granules of calcareous matter (rig. 349), which are arranged Calcification, in lines rumiing transversely to the axis of the A'essel; these lines gradually increase in breadth until they coalesce laterally, the mter- vening spaces being filled up, and the vessel being converted into a rigid tube. This form of calcification I have found to occur in the transA’erse fibres of the middle coat. Bilh’oth beheves it to commence in the muscular fibre-cells of the middle coat. It is accompanied by but little atheromatous matter. Tubular Calcification appears to be an increased degree of the varieties just described, the arteries being conA'erted into pipes or tubes of calcareous matter, with the exception of a few threads and patches, and some atheroma deposited in the coats (Fig. 350). It is especially the tibial and coronary arteries that are liable to this kind of transformation. T\Tien an ai’tery has thus been converted into a tube of calcareous matter, masses of pale, opaque, Avaxy-looking fibrine are deposited in it, and may block it up more or less completely. These masses not imcommonly midergo subsequent atheromatous degeneration. The various forms of fatty and calcareous transformation of the ai'terial coats that haA’c just been described, are constantly found associated together in the vascular system of the same individual, and often indeed in the same A'essel. It has been pointed out by Bizot that the symmetry of the arrange- ment of these morbid appearances in the corresponding A'essels on oiDpositeCAUSES OF AllTERIAL DEGENERATION. ii sides of the body is remai-kably great, the arteries of one limb being often the exact counterpart in this respect to tliose of the other. Causes. The frequent co-existence of these various morbid changes in the same portion of the arterial system points to their origin from one common cause, under the influence of which the coats of the vessel may become converted into cither fatty or calcareous matter. It is quite eriderrt that these are retrograde motamorg)hoscs, to which all fibrous tissues are especially liable imder the irrfluence of a distru’bance or diminutiorr in the rrormal rrrrtritive activity irr the part. Arrd, indeed, arry circumstarree that induces a depravation of healthy assimilation irr the system generally, ■will speedily tend to occasion a trarrsformatiou of the textm’e of the more lowly organised tissrres into products still lower irr the scale of organisatiorr : arrd this win more readily and certainly take place if any localised irrfiammatory attack have been developed. Under such influences, the fibrous tissues of which the arterial walls are composed rapidly undergo disirrtegratiorr, and conversiorr into fatty, granular, arrd earthy matter. That influerree rmder which the Utal forces of the system are most com- monly diminished irr activity is old age; and this diminution may be looked uporr as possible at arry period after the organisatiorr has reached its full matru’ity, whether this be early or late. So frequent, and indeed constarrt, are these transformations of the arterial coats during the dechne of life, that they may be considered as the rratural result of the diminu tion of the rrutrierrt actiUty consequent uporr advance in years. Gmelin has found that there is a progressive increase in the earthy matters contained in the coats of healthy arteries as the individual advances in life. Thus he has ascertairred that the ash of the arteries of a newly born child yields 0'8G per cent, of phosphate of lime ; the healthy arteries of an adult 1-25 ; arrd those of an old man 2"77 of the same salt; whilst the calcified arteries of an aged man contairr 4'01. There is rro precise period of life at which these chairges set irr : age is a relative term, and, so soon as the system has passed its full maturity, in whatever year of life this may happen, there is a tenderrey for these deposits to take place in considerable quantity. These senile trausformatiorrs, there- fore, carr scarcely be looked uporr as pathological charrges irr marry instarrees. But the same process of degradation of tissue may commerree at any, even the earliest periods of life, urrder the influerree of causes that impair the "sital forces. The Constitutional Causes that thus disjpose to or directly occasion degeneration of the arterial system are those that lead to defective orgarrisatiorr or to direct impurity of the blood, such as the various forms of chronic kidney-disease, goirt, and syphilis. To the influence of syphilis, more especially in its advarreed and constitutional forms, Aitkerr attaches great importance irr the production of atheroma. It is easy to urrderstarrd how these various iseases may exorcise a dorrble deteriorating inflirence on the arterial walls ; by the direct impairTnerrt of their rrutritiorr irr commorr with that of the fibrous textures of the body gerrorally; and, secondlg, by thecircirlation through them of blood surcharged with morbid matters, which, by irritating their lining rnembrane, may induce low forms of inflammation of their coats. It is as las been already stated, a favourite supposition with many pathologists! that these changes result directly from inflammatory action ; this certainlyDISEASES OF ARTERIES. (loos not always appear to be the case, but that it often is so, is by no means improbable. An artery in which inflammation has taken place may have its nutrition so modified as to become more susceptible to early and extensive degeneration, the plastic matters thrown out being especially liable to undergo changes leading to conversion into fat and calcareous matter. Some arteries are more liable to these structural lesions than others; and the o'elative frequency of the various forms of deposit varies in different arteries. Thus the ascending aorta is most subject to fatty degeneration, whilst the cal- careous transformation is most frequently met vdth in the arch and abdominal portion of the vessel. The arteries of the lower extremities (viz., the femoral, the popliteal, and the tibials) are chiefly affected with calcareous deposits, whilst the fatty are commonly met mth in the vessels of the brain ; and some arteries appear to be exempt from disease ; thus, Tiedemann states that he has never found the oesophageal arteries ossified. The difference in the liability of different arteries to disease is, no doubt, in a gi’eat measure, to be accounted for by the different degrees of development of the longitudinal fibrous coat in different parts of the arterial system—this being, I believe, in most instances the primary seat of the affection. Thus, in the aorta, the coronary arteries, and those of the brain, in which it abounds, we find these transformations frequent. The distance of the tibials from the centre of circulation, and the consequent diminished nutritive activity of their coats in old people, may account for the frequency of their degeneration. Those points of the arteries, likewise, upon which the shock of the onward wave of blood is most directly received, are more subject to degeneration than neighboui'ing parts of the continuity of the Avail of the vessel. This is especially observable at the origins of the arteries that spring from the arch of the aorta, and at the bifurcation of the iliacs, the popliteals, &c. ; in fact, at aU parts of the arterial system on which great pres- sure may be thrown, and Avhere the vessels may consequently be overstrained. It is also not improbable that the increased pressure of the blood upon the coats of arteries that lead to diseased organs, through which the circulation is obstructed, may tend to their degeneration, and eventually to their rupture. Sex exercises but httle general infiuence on the hability to disease in the arterial system, though it specially tends to the occiuTence of those changes in certain arteries. Thus Bizot states that the arteries of the upper extremity are most frequently diseased in women, and those of the lower in men, and Moxon states that amongst women it is most common in, those who follow laborious employments. Amongst men, also, those who are subjected to great strains in their work, more especially if that strain be intermittent as well as violent, arc more liable to degeneration of the coats of the arteries. Iiocal Effects.—The structmal lesions that have just been desci’ibed produce certain local effects, often of considerable importance, on the parts AA^ich the affected vessels supply with blood. For the proper and healthy nutrition of a limb or parr to be carried on, two great conditions arc required, so far as its arteries are concerned :—1, that the integrity of the structure of the A\alls of the vessels continue perfect; and, 2, that their channels remain pervioiAS for, although the arterial system possesses remarkable conservative powera in its arrangement and distribution that tend to counteract these effects, yet, by slow degrees, a deterioration of function and disintegration of structure take placeSTRUCTURAL CHANGES IN ARTERIES. ^3 in the part immediately supplied by the diseased vessel. Thus, in the limbs, we have all the signs of a defective circulation—coldness of the feet, cramps, and spasms of the muscles ; whilst, in organs, softening of tissue, fatty degene- ration, and other evidences of the want of a proper supply of blood leading to impaired nutrition, manifest themselves. Further Structural Changes in Arteries.—Beside the changes that take place in the parts to which the diseased arteries are distributed, ulterior effects are produced upon the vessels themselves, which may lead to important consequences. These consist in Ulceration of the Coats of the Artery ; their Spontaneous Rupture ; Contraction or Occlusion of the Interior of the Vessel ; and, lastly, its Dilatation into some of the various forms of Aneurism. Ulceration of Arteries, though frequently spoken of, in reality seldom occiu's ; the so-called ulceration being in general an erosion occasioned by a patch of softened atheroma and its investing membrane ha\dng been carried away by the ciu-rent of blood, which then washes the base of the depression thus produced in the middle coat, but is prevented from extending between the coats by the process of inflammatory fusion and cohesion Avhich has taken place in them around the patch. This apparent ulcer is deepened by the deposit around its margin of flbrine from the circulating blood, often in large gelatinous-looking masses. When true ulceration of an artery takes place, it is by destructive action commencing from without, attacking first the external coat, and not by any of the disintegrating processes commencing within the vessel. Spontaneous Kupture of an artery is rare, and never happens without previous disease of its coats. Experiments made by Peacock, w^hich I have repeated, and the accuracy of which I can fuUy confirm, prove that a healthy ai’tery will sustain a very great pressure from w^ater injected into it, without its walls giving way. But, if these have been softened or weakened by disease, they may be unable to resist even the ordinary impulse of the blood ; and if this be driven on by any unusually forcible action of the heart, as under the influence of sudden ^fiolent strain or exertion, they may give way. This occur- Tence would be much more frequent than it is in atheromatous and calcareous patches, were it not for the inflammatory consolidation of the external coat of the vessel supplying that resistance which has been lost by the softening or ■destniction of the internal and middle tunics. Hence this rupture is most frequent in those vessels the outer coat of wUich is thinnest, and in w'hich, ■consequently, it can least supply the place of the others, as in the arteries of the brain and in the intrapericardial portion of the aorta. The liability to rup- ture of a diseased artery by the distensile force of the blood impelled into it, is neatly increased by the existence of an obstacle to the free flow of the blood out of its terminal branches in consequence of a congested, infiltrated, or •chronically thickened state of the organ or part supplied by it. Contraction and Occlusion of arteries are by no means rare sequences of the structural lesions of these vessels. We have already seen that these con- ditions may arise from inflammation of the coats in any wvay excited, as by the • pressure of tumours ; but, besides this, the structural changes that take place may produce narrowing and closure of the vessel in various w\ays. Thus the diseased patch may project into the artery in such a manner that plastic matter^4 DISEASES OF ARTERIES. and coagiilnm are gTadnally deposited upon it, until the interior of the vessel is blocked up ; or the in-itation of the morljid products may give rise to chronic inflammation in the coats, occasioning contraction, the eflusion of lymph, and consequent occlusion. In one or other of these ways, arteries of all magnitudes may be gradually narrowed and at last completely closed ; and yet the patient may survive, and the parts supplied by the obstructed vessel may maintain their vitality, in consequence of the collateral circulation being sufficiently active to keep up the supply of blood to them. The vessels that are most frequently blocked up in this way are the tibials ; next to these perhaps the carotids ; the other arteries are but rarely so occluded. Yet many instances ha^ e been collected by Tiedemann of this morbid process affecting most vessels, but more especially the iliac, the brachial, and the axillary arteries, and the different branches of the abdominal aorta. Tiedemann records from various sources no fewer than eight cases in which the abdominal aorta was completely closed, in all of which so full and efficient a collateral circulation had been set np, that the vitality of the lower part of the body was perfectly maintained and in most the morbid state was not suspected during life. Besides these cases, he states that there are on record twelve instances of great narrowing of the aorta, at that point where the ductus arteriosus is implanted into it in foetal life. These would appear in some way connected with the closure of the duct ; as in every case the indentation was greatest on the convex part of the aorta, which had been drawn in towards the mouth of the duct, as if the vital con- tractile force necessary for the closure of this had extended itself to the aorta, and produced a similar action in it. When any of the arterial naiTowings or occlusions occiu’in a gTadual mamier in early life, or in a part where the collateral circulation is free, no ill effects result; but in an oj>posite condition the interference with the circulation leads to the death of the part supplied by the diseased vessel. This is particiflarly the case in the lower limbs of old people, where the circulation is extremely teeble, both as the effect of age and in consequence of the distance from the heart ; and it is in this way that the true senile gangrene or mummification of the limb occurs. The symptoms and treatment of this affection have already been adverted to (Vol. I., p. G62) ; but it may be here stated that, whilst some have considered the gangrene as entirely the result of arteritis and embolism, others look npon it as consequent on the occlusion of the vessel fi’om disease of its coats ; and each party has laid down principles of treatment in accordance with its view of the pathology of the affection. From what has preceded, it woifld appear that the arteries of a limb may be occluded, and that, consequently, gangrene may result from either condition. The occlusion from arteritis, followed by gangrene, most frequently occurs in the upper extremities, and in young or middle-aged people, and is preceded by local and constitutional symptoms of inflammation ; and the artery presents on examination the true embolic ping. The occlusion from calcification and atheroma chiefly occims ill the lower extremities, and in old people : it is preceded by a rigid condi- tion of the vessels—by cold feet, cramps, numbness, and weakness of the legs ; and, after removal, the arteries udll be found to be converted into rigid unyielding calcareous tubes, with some deposit of atheroma, and with waxy- looking masses of fibrine filling uji their interior. Besides these two distinct15 TREATMENT OF ARTERIAL OCCLUSION. forms of the disease, there is a third and very common variety, in wliich a low form of inflammation takes place in previously diseased arteries, and in which we find a combination of the two conditions. Treatment.—With regard to the treatment of nan-owing or occlusion of the arteries, uncoimected with gangrene, I have little or nothing to say ; except that, if there be reason to suspect such occunence in a limb, care must be taken to keep the part wann by means of appropriate clothing, and if there be much pain, to allay this with ojnates. If gangTcno have come on, it must be treated with reference to its cause. That connected with arteritis and embolism has already been discussed (Vol. I., p. GG7) ; but when it occurs from structural disease of the coats of the vessel, then the treatment must be directed by the existence or aljsence of any complicating inflammation, in accordance with those principles that have been laid dorni in discussing the general manage- ment of gangi-ene.i6 ANEURISM. CHAPTER XLIIl. AITEURISM. By Aneurism is meant a tumour, resulting from the dilatation of the whole or a portion of the coats of an artery caused by the contained blood, and com- municating with the interior of the vessel. Causes.—The causes of anemism are divisible into those that predispose to, and those that excite the disease. Anem-ism is Predisposed to by any affection of the arterial coats that lessens the elastic resihency of the vessel, and at the same time weakens its resisting power. When the arterial walls have under- gone more or less fatty or atheromatous degeneration, whether that consist in the distinct deposit of patches of atheroma, or of molecular deposit of fat-globules in the tissues composing their coats, their natural elasticity and resihency become lost, proportionately to the amomit of subiuflammatory and fatty change that has taken place within them. Hence as the artery becomes less and less able to contract on its contents, and to recover during the diastole from the tension exercised on its waUs during the systolic impulse, it gradually becomes distended by the repetition of the shocks which it sustains, and thus either complete or partial dilatation of its cavity takes place. I beheve that this loss of elasticity and of power of contracting on its contents, which eventually results in the dilatation of the vessel, never ocems except as the result of previous disease of the coats. In the very numerous specimens of dilated arteries that I have examined, I have never found one that had not undergone fatty degenera- tion, or atheromatous deposition. Calcification, on the other hand, rather prevents than favoins dilatation of the artery, by hardening the coats and con- verting them into rigid melastic tubes ; but atheroma softens them, and causes yielding of that portion of the vessel affected by it. I have frequently obseiwed that the whole of the artery might be healthy except at one part, where there was an atheromatous patch, and where the vessel was dilated ; or that the whole of its coats might be calcified except at one spot, where atheroma was deposited, and where consequently the coats had yielded mider the outwai’d pressm’e of the contained blood. As anemism, therefore, may be looked upon as one of the sequences ot atheroma, or at least as being invariably preceded by that form of arterial degeneration, the predisposing causes of the one condition must necessaiily be the same as those of the other. Hence we find that age, cachexy, and sj philis iufiuence the occurrence of the aneurismal disease by laying its loundations in the formation of the atheromatous deposit. Age exercises a powerful predisposing influence on the occurrence of anemism. It is dm’ing the middle period of life, about the ages of thirty and forty,17 CAUSES OF ANEURISM. that aneurisms are most frequently met with ; at those ages, indeed, when the arteries have already commenced to lose their elasticity, in consequence of disinte<n-ating changes, whilst, at the same time, the heart has not lost any of its impulsive force, or the general muscular system its contractile vigour ; and when the enfeebled and inelastic vessels, becoming exposed to powerful causes of distension, may readily give way or be expanded at some one weak- ened point. This disease is excessively rare before puberty, yet is occasionally met with at em-ly periods of life : thus Syme mentions a case of popliteal aneurism in a boy of seven, Hodgson had a preparation of a carotid aneiiiism in a girl of ten, and Schmidt a case of spontaneous anem’ism of the radial artery in an infant eight weeks old. A forcible, irregular, and occasionally greatly increased action of the heart is the immediate cause of the over-distension and dilatation of the vessels, and thus of the production of aneinism. Hence we find that this disease is especially apt to be induced in those individuals in whom the muscular system is called upon to make sudden, luolent, and intermittent exertions ; as, for instance, in men who habitually lead somewhat sedentary lives, but occasionally and suddenly change their habits, and indulge in sports, such as hunting, rowing, or a long day’s shooting, which they might wdthout risk have practised in early life, but which cannot be taken up with impunity at an age when the arteries, having become weakened, are unable to bear the same strain upon their coats as heretofore. I agree with Porter, in thinking that continuous, steady, laborious employments do not predispose to aneiudsm, •as this disease is seldom met with amongst those of the lower classes who labour hard and uninterruptedly ; but it rather occurs in those who, after long periods of comparative inaction, are occasionally and suddenly called upon to make 's'ery 'violent muscular efforts, disproportioned to their strength, or, at all events, to their previous habits. It is in this way that soldiers, sailors, and members of the higher classes in society, are rendered pecuharly liable to aneurism. As violent muscular strain and exertion predispose to this disease, Ave should necessarily expect to meet with it more frequently among men than in Avomen ; and accordingly, Crisp finds that, of 551 cases of aneurism of all kinds, more than seven-eighths occurred in men. It is important, however, to obscrA'e that different kinds of aneurism occur Avith varying degrees of fre- quency in the sexes; thus, this affection is met Avith in the carotid artery about as often in Avomen as in men, AA'hilst the.other external aneurisms occiu’ in the proportion of thirteen cases in males to every one that happens in a female, ft is remarkable, hoAveA^er, that in the dissecting aneurism the proportions arc reversed ; for every one case in men, two occur in women. Climate exercises an important influence on the occurrence of aneurism, Avhich is far more I'requent in cold than in hot countries. It is not, hoAVCA'cr, the geographical position or the meteorological state of a country that exercises any direct influence OA'er the occurrence of this disease. It is in reality the habits of the people that dispose to it, and that regulate its piwalcnce ; and it is in the more energetic nature and the more actiA'c physical habits of the northern nations that Ave must look for an explairation of its greater prevalence amongst them, than in the more indolent inhabitants of the South. If we may judge of the prevalence of aneurism in a country by the number of published VOL. II. ^ ^ANEURISM. iS reports of cases, I should say that it is of more eomnion oceurrence in Great Britain and Ireland than elsewhere ; indeed, Bonx states that it is less frequent in France than in England. In America, it is also of frequent occurrence ; hut in the East Indies it is comparatively rare. Cachexy induced by any cause, such as syphilis, chronic gout, or rheuma- tism, the abuse of n^ercin-y, &c., has a tendency to occasion disease of the coats of the arteries, and thus to predispose to aneurism. But, though mercuiy and syphilis are commonly said to tend specially to the production of this disease, I am not aware that we are in possession of any facts that would warrant us in coming to this conclusion ; though there can be no doubt that the cachexy thus induced may dispose to it as much as any other cause. It is remarkable that phtliisis is antagonistic to aneimism ; though probably this may arise from the facts that the heart’s action is feeble in that disease, and that violent muscular exertion is seldom undertaken by those labouring under it. Any obstacle to the free flow of blood through an organ or the capil- laries of a part, exercises an important influence in disposing to aneurism, as it throws an increase of pressme on the interior of the artery. Chevers believes that obstruction in the abdominal organs frequently occasions anemisms of the abdominal arteries. Sijontaneous aneurisms of the radial and nlnar arteries are supposed in the great majority of cases to be due to the obstruction caused by the impaction of an embohe clot washed on fr’om a diseased heart. The only Exciting or Direct Occasioning Causes of aneiu’ism are blows, violent strains, and wounds of an artery. When an atheromatous artery is concussed by a Uow, the lining membrane covering the softened patch may be ruptured, the atheroma being poured out into the interior of the vessel ; and thus the external coat, with perhaps a portion of the middle adherent to it, becoming exposed to the pressure of the contained blood before it has been fully consolidated by inflammation and plastic deposit, the foundation of an anein'ism may readily be laid. In very violent muscular strains or efforts, it is easy to understand how an afready weakened jjortion of the vessel may become dilated by the increased pressure that is thrown upon its interior ; and occasion- ally even the vessel may be completely torn across. Wounds impheating arteries are common causes of those various forms of aneurism that ha'^'e already been discussed in considering Injuries of Ai’teries (Vol. I., p. 313). Classification.—Anemism may be classified as follows:— 1. Fusifoem.—True. 2. Saccltiated. — j r a. Circumscribed. ^ ‘ ‘1/3. Difiused. 3. Dissecting. 1. Fusiform or Tubular Aneurism.—This is a pretcrnatui’al dilatation of an artery, all the coats of which are equally expanded through the n hole circumference of the vessel. It most frequently occurs in the aorta, and may, though rarely, be met with elsewhere. The fusiform aneurism is not a meie dilatation of the vessel, but there are elongation, thickening, and degeneration of its walls as well. The elongation of the artery in the fusiform aneurism is2.

From these dilatations, sacculated aneiii'isuis not uncommonly spring. On examining the structure of a fusiform aneurism, it will he found that it is always composed of an iinifonn expansion and outgi’owth of all the coats of the artery, which are at the same time somewhat altered in character ; thus, the outer coat is thickened, the middle rigid and inelastic, and the inner one stiffened, rugged, and tiihercu-’ latcd by the deposition beneath it of A'arioiis plastic and atheromatous masses. iSio coagula, however, are found in the dilatation, but a few filamentary shreds of fibrine are occasionally seen to be at- tached to the inner wall. The arteries that are usually the seats of fusi- form aneurism are the arch of the aorta Fig. 351.—Large Fusiform Aneurism of Ascend- ing Aorta bursting into Pericardium. (Fig. 351), the iliacs, the femorals, and occasionally the axillaries. This par- ticular form of aneurism ocem’s most generally in vessels in which the yellow elastic coat is largely developed, and hence is rarely met with in arteries smaller than the femoral; it occurs, however, in the basilar artery of the brain. The fusiform dilatation, especially when seated in the arch of the aorta, may attain a very considerable magnitude, and may consequently exercise very injurious pressure on contiguous parts, thus producing great distress and danger of life. It is usually extremely chronic, increasing very slowly, and being compatible with existence for many years ; but at last it usually destroys the patient, and may occasion death in several ways. Thus, if it be situated in the aorta, the great mass of blood in the sac may, by impeding the circulation, overpower the heart’s action, so that it may be unable to recover itself, and fatal syncope may be induced. Then, again, death may result from pressure on important parts, as on the bronchi or oesophagus. In general, however, the cause of death is the ghing way of a sacculated aneimism springing from the fusifoiTU one. When, however, tubular aneurism of the arch of the aorta occupies the intrapericardial portion of the vessel, it not unlrequently happens that, owing to the absence of a sheath in this situation, the artery may rupture. It most commonly happens that a fusiform aneurism remains quiescent, being- a source of discomfort, but not of death, until the sacculated form of the disease springs from its side ; and then this, becoming the more formidable affection, may destroy life in some of the ways peculiar to it.20 ANEURISM. Fig. 852.—Sacculated Aueurism of Asceiidiu; Aorta. Death hy Pressure. springing from the side of an artery or of a tubular aneurism, with the interior of which it coinmmiicates by a narrow aperture, called the mouth of the sac (Fig, 352). It is generally divided into the True and Fcclse ^m’ieties. True Sacculated Aneurism.—By this is meant a partial dilatation of all the coats of the vessel. Its existence has been denied ; thus iScarpa doubts the occurrence of such a disease, and Bizot seems disposed to coincide with him. With these eminent pathologists, however, I cannot agree ; and though I am mlling to admit that many of the so-called “ true ” aneurisms are not so in reality, yet I can- not doubt, from repeated observation, that Hodgson is right in saying that in their early stages sacculated aneurisms are not unfrequently of the true kind. Thus, we occasionally find, as Peacock has pointed out, small digital pouches springing from the walls of some of the larger arteries, through the whole of which the external, middle, and internal coats can be demon- strated by maceration to exist; and in those aneurisms which are formed by the dilata- tion of a comparatively large portion of the arterial wall, it not mifrequently happens that the tumoin remains of the true kind for some time, as I have ascertained by careful dissection. But after an anemdsm has attained a certain size, its coats become so fused together, and so closely incorporated with the neigh- boining tissues, that their precise structine cannot be made out. Indeed for a sacculated aneurism to be of the true kind, I believe that two conditions ai-e necessary :—1, that the tumour itself be small; and 2, that the mouth of the sac be of tolerably large dimensions. Porter says that he has never met vidth a true aneiu’ism larger than a small orange ;• and, certainly, none of those that I have seen, provided they were of the sacculated kind, have exceeded this size. In true sacculated aneurisms, also, it is necessary that the mouth of the sac, or that portion of it which communicates with the interior of the artery, should be of good size, and not bear too great a disproportion to the wan of the tumour. I cannot conceive a large sac with a small mouth to be a true aneurism ; for, as the mouth of the sac corresponds exactly in size to that portion of the arterial coats which has been originally dilated, it is not easy to understand how a large and thick sac can be expanded out of a small segment of the wall of the artery. It must be remembered that in all cases of true aneurism, however small they may be, the size of the sac greatly exceeds that of its mouth. It is therefore clear’ that there must have been not only expansion, but a degree of hypertrophy and overgrowth of the wall of the vessel, just as in the tubular aneurism, otherwise the sac would be thinned in the exact proportion of its expansion. False Sacculated Aueurisiu is that variety of the disease in which theDISSECTING ANEURISM. 21 infcenial, or the internal and middle, coats have been ruptured, and arc co^e- quently deficient. This is by far the most frequent form of sacculated aneurism, and is that which is met with of so gi’cat a size. In by far the majority of cases, the internal coat, and the innermost layers of the middle coat, have been destroyed by atheromatous degeneration, leaving an erosion or depression in the interior of the artery, with weakness of the coiTCsponding portion of its wall, which becomes expanded by the outward pressure of the blood. In these cases the sac is principally formed by the expansion of the outer coat, to which some of the layers of the middle may still be adherent, but which is essentially strengthened and thickened by plastic deposits, and by adhesions to neigh- boiu-iug parts, Avhich have become fused into its composition. In these cases there are outgrowth, hypertrophy, and new deposit in and upon the external coat, as is e^■idenced by its actually becoming thicker, instead of its being thinned, as it would be were it only expanded. The formation of an aneurism by the hernial protrusion of the internal and middle coats through an ulcerated aperture in the external coat has been described ; but, though there is a preparation in the Museum of the College of Surgeons that is supposed to illustrate this fact, I doubt the existence of such a form of the disease, and after careful examination think that the preparation in question represents I’ather an artificial dissection than a true rupture of this dense and elastic coat. A false aneiuism may always be readily distinguished from a true one, by the greater magnitude that it attains, by the size of the sac being out of all proportion to that of its mouth, and, on a section of this being made, by the middle coat being seen to terminate abruptly in a thick and dense ring, imme- diately around the mouth and neck of the sac. A false aneurism may either be so from the very first, the internal and middle coats having been destroyed by softening and erosion, and the external expanded and hypertrophied into a sac ; or it may originally have been a true aneiuism, and have been converted into the false variety of the disease by the giving way of some of its coats. Surgeons generally recognise .two varieties of false aneiuism—the circumscribed and the diffused. By the Circumscribed False Aneurism is meant that form of the disease in which the blood is stiU contained ivithin a sac, formed by at least one of the arterial coats, however expanded and altered in its struckire this may be. The term Diffused False Aneurism includes two distinct varieties of the disease. In one case there is ruptiue of the sac, with general and widely spread extravasation of blood into the areolar tissue of the limb or part. In the other case it happens that the sac formed by the dilatation and hypertrophy of the outer coat of the artery is ruptured, and the blood, although effused beyond this, is still confined in a sac of condensed areolar tissue, formed by the raattei- together with coaguliun and lymph of the structures into which the blood has been effused. 8. Dissecting Aneurism is a remarkable form of the disease, originally described by Shekeltou, in which the sac is situated in the wall of the artery between its coats. It originates in consequence of the internal coat of the vessel becoming eroded, and giving way before any of that adhesion and matting together of the tissues around the patch has taken place, which pre- vents the blood from being forced between the different tunics of the arter5\ANEURISM. The rupture, althougli originating in the internal coat, always extends between ^he layers of the middle one, splitting this np into two laminaj, and in some cases it also separates the middle from the external tunic of the vessel. On examining the artery in a case of dissecting aneurism, its coats will always be found to he easily separable from one another, and to he very lacerablc, often appearing soft and sodden as if macerated. For the production of this disetise, indeed, two conditions are necessary : 1. That there be atheromatous disease of the artery, destroying a portion of the internal and of the innermost layers of the middle coat; and 2. That there be not only a want of plastic matter eflPuscd about the diseased part of the vessel, but also a general softening of the tissue of the middle coat, with want of cohesion between the different tunics of the artery : this, indeed, maybe con- sidered as the essential condition dis- posing to the formation of a dissecting aneurism, and causing the disease to assume this rather than the sacculated form. The rupture constituting dissecting aneurism always takes jfface longitudi- nally along the middle coat, and may often extend to a very considerable dis- tance. Thus it may reach ft’om the arch of the aorta to the iliacs, or from the same part to the bifurcation of the carotids. The disease only occurs, how- ever, in the aorta, and in its princij)al branches—in those arteries, indeed, in which the middle coat is highly de- veloped, and the yellow elastic tissue abundant. Classes.—Dissecting anemdsms ar- range themselves into three distinct classes. 1. In one class, the blood, after having passed for a distance of several inches, or even more, through the substance of the middle coat, bursts through the external coat, and becomes effused into the areolar tissue outside the vessel and around the seat of rupture, or into the neighbouring ca’sdties (Fig. 353). In these cases, which constitute the most common variety of the disease, death usually occiu’s rajndly, the patient feeling intense pain along the line of rupture, and falling into a state of syncope. 2. The external coat may become so thickened and strengthened by the deposit of plastic matter, that it resists the impulse of the blood, which consequently continues to pass between the layers of the middle coat until it meets a softened and athero- matous patch, and then again bursts into the canal of the ai’tcry. In this form of the disease, the patient may live for years after the occurrence of the ruptiu’e; the new channel that the blood has taken becoming lined with a Fig. 353.—Euiiture of Lining Membrane of Aorta, giving rise to a Dissecting Aneurism wMcli burst into PericartUum.

Tbe appeai-ancc here presented by the vessel has occasionally been erroneously described as constituting a double aorta. 3. The blood may find its way between tbe hunina3 of the middle coat, but docs not escape farther by rupture of the external, or by the giving way of the lining membrane of the vessel. A sac is consequently formed in the substance of the middle coat, which may become chronic, but will at last undergo external rupture. Process of Formation of an Aneurism.—The progression of the changes leading to the formation of an aneurism is briefly as follows. The coats of the artery°undergo fatty degeneration, and atheroma is deposited at one part ; this softens, and the lining membrane covering it, perhaps with a portion of the inner layers of the middle coat, becomes eroded ; or the walls of the vessel may be weakened at this point wdthout any destruction of their coats. Cohesion, however, takes place between the tissues of the vessel at the eroded or weakened spot ; and the outer coat becomes strengthened and thickened by the deposi- tion of plastic matter. Dilatation next takes place at this point ; if of the entire coats, a true aneiu’ism is formed ; if of the eroded tunics, a false aneurism occurs : but if no cohesion have previously taken place between the different coats of the vessel, the blood becomes effused into and between them, thus constituting a dissecting aneurism. Structure of an Aneurism.—An aneurismal sac, if it be composed of a dilatation of all the coats of an artery, may be recognised on dissection by the atheromatous and calcareous deposits which are met with in the tissues of which it is composed. If it be a false aneurism, it will be found that there is little, if any, of these deposits in the walls of the sac ; that the middle coat usually terminates abruptly at its mouth, and that the external coat is greatly thickened and strengthened by the depiosition of plastic matter. An aneu- rismal sac may vary in size, from a tumour not larger than a cherry to a growth of the magnitude of a cocoa-nut or large melon. The mouth, which is o^•al or round in shape, I’aries greatly in size, being always very small in proportion to the sac. Usually the interior of an aneurismal sac con- tains a quantity of decolorised fibrine, arranged in concentric laminse of but moderate thickness ; these laminte of fibrine are of a pale-buff colour, dry, and somewhat brittle where they are most closely applied to the waU of the sac ; the more external ones appear to bo those that are first formed, and occasionally are found to have undergone a kind of atheromatous degeneration ; as we approach the interior of the vessel, they become softer and more coloured, and at last, in the central portions, dark masses of coagulum are often met with. This decolorised fibrine, called by Broca the active clot, proceeds from two sources. It is partly deposited from the blood which is beaten up in the interior of the sac, and thus deposits its fibrine much in the same way as when it is whipped in an ordinary vessel; this is probably the manner in which the principal masses are found deposited, and the fibrine so deposited is aiTanged in lamina; that take the com’se of the current of the blood, as inirig. 351. In some cases, liowever, it would appear as if it were formed by deposition from the wall ot the aneurism ; for the mass, not being out of the cuiTent of the circulation, cannot well have been deposited from the blood.ANEURISM. but must ill nil probability have been the result of the effusion of nlastio of that r ^ ''''' tl^ere is little ov any of that stiatified arrangement that is observable in the fibrinc which k hi k J f a laminated hbiine just described, and is evidently the result of simple coagulation It is the passive clot of Broca. The use of the deposited hbrine appears to be in a gi-eat measure to strengthen the waUs of the sac, and thus to prevent the too rapid increase of the tumour. Another groat pm-posc that it serves is to lessen the capacity of the sac, and thus to diminish the distending force of the blood which is injected at each stroke of the heart—the outward pressme depending as much on the area of the sac as on the force with which the blood is di’iveii into it. Then again, the lining of the walls of the sac with such a tough and elastic material as the stratified fibriiie, must greatly tend to deaden and break the force of the shock of the wave of blood that is projected against what would otherwise be an unprotected and expanded mem- brane. In those cases in ivliich the laminated fibriue is small in quantity or altogether deficient, the aneurismal tumour rapidly increases with a forcible pulsation that is not met with in other cii’cumstances. Pressure-Effects.—As the sac of an aneurism enlarges, it exercises in- jurious and often fatal effects by its pressure upon contiguous parts. These pressure-effects deserve attentive study, as they constitute an important and, in some instances, the sole element in the diagnosis of the anem-ism. One of the most common pressure-effects of aneurism is the occurrence of oedema of the limb or part, owing to the compression exercised by the tumour upon the large and deep venous trunlcs in its ■sicinity. The consequent ob- struction to the venous circulation in the interior of the bmb may also give rise to a distended or varicose condition of the subcutaneous vessels, and in some instances it may even go on to the production of gangrene. The pressime of the sac, also, on neighbouring arteries, or even on the uj)per part of the A'ery vessel from which it springs, and its interference with the general capillary circulation of a part, is commonly associated Avith the A’cnous compression, and may considerably increase the ill-consequences resulting from it. The pres- sure upon a neighboiu’ing artery may go on to perforation of the A'essel by the sac, and so a communication betAveen the tAvo may be set up ; thus aneurism of the aorta has been known to perforate and communicate Avith the pulmonary artery. By its pressure upon neighbouring nerves, an aneurismal sac may give rise either to great pain in the part supplied by them, or to distiu’bance of their function ; the nerves themselves becoming, in some cases.

Layers of Laminated Fibrine arranged in the direction of tlie Current of tlie Blood.DURATION OF ANFURTSAL 25 expanded or flattened ont, and ribbon-like (Fig. 355), and in other instances tortuous and waving, and being considerably elongated The pain in tho nerves is often one of the earliest signs of the existence of an aneurism. Ihe paiu is usually of two kinds : it is either lancinating and radiating along the coui-sc of the nerve that is compressed ; or, when the tumour presses severely upon neighbouring parts and tissues, more especially if it give rise to erosion of the bones (as in Fig. 373), an aching, burning, tearing, or boring sensation is often experienced in the part subjected to the pressure. In other cases, again, important modifications in the function of parts take place, in conse- quence of the pressme that is exercised upon their nerves. Thus, for instance, the compression of the recurrent laryngeal nerve will occasion hoarseness of I'oice and difiiculty of breathing, depending on spasm of the glottis. On the hones an aneurism may produce very important effects by its pressime, eroding or wasting away the osseous tissue in some instances, and in others giving rise to true caries. If the bone be a flat one, as the sternum, the aneurism may perforate it by making as smooth and round a hole in it as if this had been worked by the trephine. Glandular organs and their ducts in the neighbourhood of aneurisms suffer the most injiuioiis effects from the pressure of these tumours, their functions being arrested, and the passage of their secretions interfered ivith; so, also, by the pressure exercised on the trachea and ocsoiohagus, respira- tion and deglutition may be seriously impeded. XuMBEE.—Anem’isms, though usually single, are not very unfrequently multiple. There may be more than one tumoim of this kind in the same limb ; thus the iliac and femoral arteries on the same side may both be affected. In other cases, corresponding arteries, in opposite limbs are the seat of aneurism; thus the two poiiliteals are not unfrequently found to he the seat of this disease, and occasionally an aneurism may exist in one of the limbs, and others in the arteries of the in- terior of the body. When more than one aneiirismal po^teiior^'Tibki'*^Nen^^^^^ b"- tumour ocem-s in the same individual, the patient is tie aur of said to lie labouring under the aneurismal diathesis.

I he diu'ation of an aneurism A'aries very greatly. In young' full-blooded persons it often makes progress with great rapidity ; whereas in elderly people of feeble constitutions, or in those of a cachectic habit of body, accompanied with more or less debility of the heart’s action, the disease may assume a very chronic form ; thus, Hodgson relates the case of an aneurism of the femoral artery of twenty years’ duration. Much also will depend on the situation of the aneurism, the size of the mouth of the sac, and the relation of the sac to the impulse of the blood into it; the larger and more direct the mouth of the tumour, the more readily wiU the blood be projected into it at each impulse of the heart, and the more quickly will the tninour expand.26 ANEURISM. Syjipto.aes.—The symptoms of an aneurism are of two kinds ; I. Those that are peculiar to this disease ; and 2. Those that are simply dependent on the presence of the tumour occasioned by the enlarging sac. The peculiar or patho- gnomonic signs are those that are dependent on tlie communication of the sac with tlie artery ; they consist of signs afforded by the manual and auscultatory eXcuninatioa of the tumour ; those that are dei^endcnt on the mere size of the growth are the pressure-effects. It is of course only in external aneurisms that those signs which are ascertainable on manual examination of the tumour can usually bo recognised. In internal aueiuisms, in the majority of cases, the auscultatory signs and the pressure-effects afford the best indications of the piescnce and natme of the tumour ; though, when this approaches the surface, much information can be gained by palpation. Symptoms of External Circumscribed Aneurism.—The tumour is usually round or oval, distinctly circumscribed, and is situated upon and in close, connection with some large artery. It is at first somewhat compressible, but afterwards becomes more and more solid as fibrine is deposited in it. The most marked sign is, perhaps, the pulsation that is felt in it from the very first. This is of a distensile, exceiitric, and expanding character, separating the hands when laid upon each side of the tmnour, by a distinct impulse fi'om within out- wards. The pulsation is most forcible in an aneiu’ism in which there is but little laminated fibrine ; and as this increases in quantity the pulsation gradually loses its tense expanding character, being converted into a dead thud, and in some cases ceasing entirely. When pulsation is obscure, the compression of the artery below the sac will cause it to become more distinct, or it may be in- creased in distinctness by elevating the limb or part affected. When the artery above the sac is compressed, the flow of blood into the tumour is necessarily arrested, and a considerable quantity of its more fluid contents may be squeezed out by gentle pressme. If the hands be then laid upon each side of the tumom, and the pressure suddenly taken off the artery, the blood will be found to rush into and distend the sac by a sudden stroke, separating the hands from one another. This may be looked upon as one of the most characteristic signs of anemdsm. The hruit or sound emitted by the blood in its passage through an aneiu’- ismal sac was first noticed by Ambrose Pare. It varies much in character, Ijeing usually loud rasping or saufing—loudest and roughest in tubular aneurisms. Occasionally the bruit is double, and if so, it clearly indicates the saccu- lated nature of the aneurism. It is possible, however, that when great aortic regiu’gitation is present, the backward emrent of blood in the large vessels might give rise to a feeble diastolic murmur in a fusiform auemism. In many cases it is altogether absent ; this especially happens in sacculated aneurisms with small mouths, or in those that are much distended uith coagula and blood. The absence of sound, therefore, in a tumour must not be taken as a proof that it is not an aneurism. The sound is usually best heard in aneiuisms that are not too fully distended with blood ; indeed, it is usually most distinct when the sac is partially emptied. Thus, for instance, it not un- frequently haj)pens that, in an aneurism of the ham or thigh no bruit, or but a very faint one, is audible so long as the patient is staiidiiig ; but if he lie down, and elevate the limb so as to partly empty the sac, then it may be distinctly heard. Another sign of considerable importance consists in the diminution in27 SYMFT02IS OF DIFFUSED ANEURISM. the size of the tumour, and the cessation of the pulsation and Iruit on compressing the vessel leading to the sac, and the immediate and sudden return of these signs on remoring the pressure from the artery. r f ^ :^IauY of the symptoms that have just been described are peculiar to and their cLbination is characteristic of anem-ism, being dependent on the com- munication that exists between the artery and the sac. dhose that result from the i)ressm-e of the sac upon neighbouring parts are common to aneurism and to any other kind of tumour ; but, though not of so special a character as those that have just been described, they are of considerable importance in determining the nature of the disease when taken in conjunction with the other symptoms. Symptoms of Diffused Aneurism.—When a sacculated circumscribed aneurism becomes diffused, the sac having given way, but the blood being still bomided by the tissues of the limb, the patient experiences a sudden and acute pain in the part, and usually becomes pale, cold, and faint. On examination, it will be found that the tumour has suddenly and gTeatly increased in size,^ at the same time that it has lost its circumscribed and distinct outline, dhe pulsation and bruit become materially diminished in force and in distinctness, having receded as it were from the surface, and may disappear altogether. The limb may also become oedematoiis, or may suffer in other ways fr’om the diffused effects of the pressme of the aiiem-ismal swelling upon the neighbouring veins and tissues. At the same time, the circulation in it being greatly obstructed, the limb may become cold and livid, and a sensation of weight and general inutility wdl be experienced in it. In these circumstances the anemlsmal swelling usually becomes harder, in consequence of the coagulation of the blood in the areolar tissue around the sac ; by which indeed the fm’ther extension of the disease is arrested, and a fresh boundary is often formed, so as to bmit the extravasated blood. If it be left to itself, the tumour will now usually rapidly increase in size, sometimes without, sometimes Avith much pulsation, and per- haps evidence of inflammatory action around it, so that at last it may so obstruct the circulation through the limb as to occasion gangTene ; or, if it adA^ance towards the surface, the skin coA^'ering it becomes thinned and reddened, the tumour becomes soft and semi-fluctuating, OAviug to the coagulum breaking doAvn, and eA’entually external ruptm’e of the sac AviU ensue. In some cases it happens that, Avhen rupture of the sac takes place, the effused blood, instead of being limited by the surrounding areolar tissue, be- comes suddenly and Avidely extravasated into the substance of the limb. A\Tieu this untoAvard accident happens, the shock and local disturbance are very great, and the patient is suddenly seized Avith a A’ery severe lancinating and numbing pain in the part. The pain is most severe in those cases in Avhich the rupture takes place under the deep fasciae, by AA'hich the effused blood is tightly bomid down; and it may be so severe as to occasion syncope. In other instances, faintness occurs from the sudden loss of blood out of the current of the circula- tion into the substance of the part, the SAvelling being greatest in those instances m Avhich the blood is suddenly and largely effused into the areolar tissue. If the extravasation happen in a limb, this will become greatly swollen, hard, brawny, and cold. The superficial veins are congested, and the circulation in the lower parts of the memljer is soon completely an-ested by the pressureANEUlilSM. 28 ot the oxtravasatecl and semi-coagnlated blood upon its vessels, more particulaidy the large A-enous trunks. In consequence of this, gangrene ot a moist kind usually makes its appearance, and speedily destroys the patient’s life. Diagnosis.—The diagniosis of aneurism may in many cases be effected with the greatest possible ease by a student in surgery ; in other instances it requires a vast amount of care, and the most experienced judgment, to come to a correct conclusion as to the nature of the tumom-. This is easily done Avhen the aneu- rism is superficial, recent, and circumscribed, the blood in it being fluid, and all the signs of the disease well marked. The diagnosis is often replete with difficulty when the aneurism is deeply seated, or, if external, when it is old and filled with coagula ; also, if suppurative action have taken place about it, or if it have become diffused. In effecting the diagnosis of aneurism we have, in the first jilace, to ascertain the existence or absence of a tiunour ; and, after this has been done, to ascertain whether it be aneurismal or of some other character. Both points, the latter especially, are difficult to determine in internal aneurisms ; in the external, the doubt is not as to the presence of a tumour, but as to its nature. The tumours with which aneiu'isms may be confounded may conveniently be di'^ided into two classes—those that do and those that do not pulsate. Every pulsating tumour is not an anetu'ism. Thus there may be pulsation in various kinds of encephaloid tumour or soft sarcoma, or in (jroxvtlis composed of erectile tissue. In such cases as these, many of the signs of aneurism are present; thus the size of the tumour may be diminished by compression, and the distinct influx of blood into it may be felt on the removal of the pressure, the tumour returning to its original size with a soft swelling pulsation : there may also be a bruit, often of a loud and distinct character. But these tumours may generally be dis- tinguished from aneurisms in not being quite so distinctly circumscribed —in being soft, spongy, and elastic, without the sensation of fluid that is met with in some forms of aneurism, or of solid coagula that occurs in others. Again, the bruit is either soft, blovfing, and more prolonged, or else sharp and superficial ; the pulsation, also, is not so distinct, and is more of the nature of a general swelling and heaving of the tumour than of a distinct thump. Much light is also occasionally thrown upon these affections by their being met with in situations where aiiem’ism cannot occm’, from the absence of any arteries of sufficient size to give rise to it, as, for instance, on the head of the tibia or the side of the pelvis ; but if a tumour of this kind be situated upon or under a large artery in the usual site of an aneiu-ism, then the diagnosis is certainly replete with diflicidty, and cannot indeed in many cases be made. Several instances have of late years occurred, in which Surgeons of the greatest skill and experience (as Guthi’ie and Stanley) have ligatured arteries on the sup- position that they had to do Avith anemism, Avhen in reality it Avas one of the pulsating tumours just mentioned that closely simulated it. Pulsation may be communicated to a tumour of a fluid character seated upon an artery ; hero the diagnosis, though often difficult, is more readily made than in the last case. Attention to the history of the case, to the im- possibility of diminishing the tumour by pressiu’c, either directly upon it or on29 DIAGNOSIS OF ANEURISM. the artery leading to it, its fluctuation, and want of circumscription, will usually point out its nature. Especial attention should likewise be paid to the flicts that the pulsation is a distinct heaving up and down of the tumour, and neither exccntric nor distensile, and that the swelling may often be wholly or partly separated, by raising it up, from the artery lying beneath it. By at- tention to these points, abscesses in the axilla, under the pectorals, at the root of the neck, and in other situations where pulsation may readily be com- municated to the fluid mass, can be distinguished fr’om anemisms; yet eiTors in diagnosis have happened, and will continue to do so, from the intrinsic difficulty of these cases, and from no want of skill or care on the part of the Surgeon : and those will be most charitable in their criticisms of the mistakes of others, who have most frequently had occasion to experience these difficulties in their own practice. Tumours that do not pulsate, either by theii- own vessels or by those that lie beneath them, are not so readily confounded with aneurism as the class of affections that has just been described. Yet it must be borne in mind, that in some instances even aneurisms do not pulsate, or but very indistinctly so, having become filled with a dense and firm coagulum. The non-pulsating tumours that chiefly require attention are glandular, scirrhous, or thyroid ■sivellings, seated over the cai’otid artery at the root of the neck, or in the popliteal s]3ace. If these be .of a fluid character, then* fluctuation, unvarying size, and the want of pulsation in them, sufficiently indicate that they are not connected -with the artery, fr-om which they may also frequently be sepa- rated, and upon which they may be dis- tinctly moved. If solid, they ai-e usually in-egular and nodulated on the surface, and can fr-equently be detached by the fingers being passed underneath them and raising them from the subjacent vessel. There is much danger of mis- taking a consolidated aneurism Avhich is undergoing or has undergone spontaneous cure, and in which there is consequently no pulsation, for a solid tumoiu’ of some kind. I have known one instance in which the thigh was amputated for a very painful solid tumour of the popliteal space, Avhich proved on dissection to be a consoli- dated aneurism pressing upon the posterior tibial nerve (Fig. 35G).

I30 ANEURISM. lifive hvice ligatured the external iliac for aneurisms of the gi’oin that had been mistaken for abscesses. Oceasionally, the more fatal en-or has been committed of puncturing the tumour with the view of letting out pus, when none appeared, and, either immediately or after a lapse of a few hours, profuse arterial hemor- rhage ensued. That this accident may arise from the intrinsic difficulties of the diagnosis, is evident from the fact that it has happened to such Surgeons as Desault, Pelletan, Dupuytren, Pirogoff, and many others. I have once seen this accident occur to a Surgeon of considerable experience, who, mistaking a diffused popliteal aneimism for an abscess, opened it with a bistoury, but finding no pus, applied a poultice; alarming hemorrhage ensued in about forty hom’s, and I amputated the thigh on the second day after this untoward occuiTence. The difficulty in diagnosis is especially apt to occur in those aneurisms which, haA'ing become diffused, have ceased to pulsate, have no bruit, are elastic, softened, and diffluent to the feel, and in which the skin has become reddened and inflamed by pressure from within. It is only by careful atten- tion to the history of the case, and by skilful manipulation, that the true nature of the tumour can be ■ made out. But an anemism may actually become associated A\dth an abscess in one or two ways. Thus it may suppurate, inflam- mation of a suppurative character taking place in the areolar tissue around it, with swelling, redness, oedema, and heat of the integirmental structures, increase of size in the tumoiu, and probably diffuse solidification of it. If this abscess be opened or allowed to burst, dark gTumous pus will escape, followed by coagula and masses of broken dorni decolorised fibrine, and sometimes accom- panied, but more usually followed after a lapse of some hours, by a free and perhaps fatal discharge of florid blood. Another form of combination between abscesses and aneurism consists in the opening of an artery by ulceration into the cavity of an abscess, so that the blood is projected directly into this from the opened vessel. In cases of this Idnd—of Avhich the instance that occun-ed to Liston is a good example— Ave have the ordinary signs of abscess, usually of a chronic character, to Avhich those of an aneurism are generally suddenly superadded, Avith gueat increase in the bnlk of the tumour. This accident has chiefly been obseiwed in abscess of the neck, opening up a communication AAith the carotid artery. 'With rheumatism and neuralgia it Avould at first appear to be difficult to confound an anenrism, but in practice it is not so. I have knoAvn several cases in Avhich the lancinating pains of aneurism, more especially when the tumour was internal, have been mistaken and treated for rheumatic or neuralgic affections ; and I have even knoAvn the pain occasioned by the presence of a large aneurism of the tliigh treated for several weeks as rheumatism. In such cases as these, it is of course obvious that a little care and proper examination will usimlly serve to establish the diagnosis. The aneurismal may be distinguished from the rheumatic pain by its haAing a twofold character—being both lancmating and intermittent, as well as continuous, aching, and burning hen this kind of pain is persistent, especially about the back, the side of the Imad or aim, it ought always to cause the Surgeon’s attention to be directed to the condition of the neighbouring large vessels. . . ^ Terminations.—Spontaneous Cure of an aneurism is o Aciy larc occm ^ rence. The manner in Avhich it happens has been especially and ably stiidicc \vSPONTANEOUS CURE OF ANEURISM. 31 Ifod'^on, and more recently by Bellingham ; and the pathology of this process is ot”considerahle interest, from its bearing upon the cure of the disease by snrgical operation. The spontaneous cure may accidentally, though very rarely, occur by inflammation of the aneurism and consequent obliteration of the artery; but most frequently it is by the gradual deposition of laminated fibrine in the interior of the sac that it is filled up completely. This process can only take place in aneurisms affecting arteries of the second or third magnitude, and ne'^ er in those of the aorta ; and it can only happen in sacculated aneimisms, the fusifoi-m not admitting of it, it being necessary that the blood flowing through the sac be somewhat retarded in its passage, so as to give time for the deposit of its fibrine upon the interior of the tumour. This process, which is a very different one from the coagadation of the blood, is the increase of a natural condition always going on in the sac. In all cases of sacculated aneurism, there is a tendency to the production of a spontaneous cure, though this is rarely ac- complished. The tendency to it is shown by a contraction and partial occlusion of the artery Moiv the sac, and the consequent diminished force of the circu- lation through it, by which the deposition of fibrine is greatly increased, at the same time that the collateral vessels given off cibove the sac often enlarge to a considerable extent, and thus divert fr’om it blood which would other-' ■\rise have passed through it. This condition of the vessel below the sac may be looked ujjon as the first and most important step towards the consoli- dation of the tumour. The process is also materially assisted by the mouth of the sac being small, and so situated that the blood cannot be directly driven into it. For spontaneous cure to take place, it is not necessary that the whole current of blood should be suddenly arrested. If such an accident occur, the aneu- rismal sac becomes filled with a large dark soft clot, which soon yields, if from any cause a pulsating stream of blood be again admitted, but which under favourable circumstances may lead to a complete cure. If blood continue to circulate through the sac, deposit of laminated fibrine Avill take place if the impetus with Avhich this fluid is sent into the tumour be considerablv diminished. This may happen fr-om the occimrence, in the distal portion of the artery or the mouth of the sac, of some or other of those con- ditions that have akeady been described. So, also, it has been found that, in those cases in which two anemisms are situated upon one artery, the distal one is very apt to undergo partial or even complete consolidation, the blood losing its impetus in its passage through the fii-st sac. Any constitu- tional cause or condition also, by Avhich the impulse of the heart is lessened, and the force of the flow of blood through the sac diminished (as the occur- rence of phthisis), will favour greatly the deposit of laminated fibrine and the consolidation of the tumoiu’. As the aneurism undergoes spontaneous ciu’e, the pulsation in it gTadually becomes more and more feeble, until it ceases entirely ; the bruit proportion- ately lessens, the tumour becomes harder, and at last completely consolidated ; at the same time, the anastomosing circulation is sometimes fonnd to be. established in some of the collateral vessels of the limb. Eventually the* solidified tumour shrinks in size, undergoing a species of drying and absorp- tion, with ultimate conversion into a small mass of fibro-areolar tissue32 ANEURISM. Causes of Death from Aneurism.—An aneurism may prove fatal in various Avays. It does so Avlren internal, most frequently by p-esswre on parts of importance in its Aicinity, the patient being destroyed by the exhaustion induced by interference Avitb their functions ; this is usually the Avay in which aneurisms of the aorta occasion death. Then, again, death may result by the occurrence of syncope, more especially if the anemism be of large size, and •situated near the root of the aorta. Emholism of the cerebral arteries may occur in consequence of the detachment of a clot. External aneurism most commonly proves fatal by rupture of the sac; this may either take place into the interior of a limb, giving rise to one or other of the diffused forms of •aneurism, and terminate fatally by the induction of syncope or gangrene ; or an aneurism may kill by ruptm’e occurring externally, on'one of the smffaces ■of the body. Suppuration -with sloughing of an aneurismal sac is not of very hoquent occuiTence, but is especially apt to happen in those cases in which the tumour has increased rapidly, or has suddenly become diffused, 'with much heat and tension of neighbomlng parts. It is pecuharly liable to happen in tumoiu’s of a large size that have become partly diffused, that are filled ■with masses of decolorised fibrine, and that are situated in places where the areolar tissue is abundant and lax, as in the axilla. The symptoms of this condition impending are swelling, tension with heat, tlnobbing, and redness of the parts aroimd the tumour ; the integuments covering which pit on pressure, and are -evidently deeply inflamed, at the same time that there is a good deal of fever and general constitutional irritation. As the suppuration advances, the ordi- nary signs of congesthe abscess occur : the skin covering the tumoiu’ becomes red and livid at one part, where pointing takes place ; and if the Surgeon make an incision into it, or if the tiunoiu’ biu’st (as assuredly it Avill if left to itself), a quantity of sanious pus mixed ■with large masses of broken do'«m rig. 357.—Aperture in CEsoi)liagus proiluced by Pressure of an Aortic Aneurism.

The discharge of the contents of the aneurismal sac, disintegrated by and mixed up Avith the results of suppuiativeMEDICAL TREATMENT OF ANEURISAL 33 action, may be followed by so profuse a gush of arterial blood that the patient the case of Liston, the sac of the aneurism which caused the death of that oreat Surgeon had actually given way, a mass of coagulum projecting from it into the trachea ; yet death resulted from the iratation induced by pressure upon the inferior laryngeal nerve, and not fr’om h^moirhage. Treatmext.—The treatment of aneurism is of two kinds—constitutional and local. In many cases, as in the various forms of internal aneiu’ism, for instance, the constitutional treatment can alone be employed ; and in aU cases of external aneurism it should be had recourse to as an important adjunct to any local measures that are adopted. In the Constitutional or Medical Treatment of aneurism, the great object is to bring about the same condition as that by which the spontaneous cure of the disease is effected, and, indeed, to put the patient and the part in the most favourable state for nature to consohdate the tumour ; and, though it may not be possible in the great majority of cases to effect a cure in this way, at all events the disease may be palliated, and its progress retarded. The sacculated is, however, the only form of aneurism that can ever be cured by constitutional means ; in the fusiform variety, aU that can be done is to retard the progress of the disease. The principal objects to be held in view are, in the first place, to lessen the force of the heart’s impulse, so as to diminish the excentric pressure upon the arterial coats ; and, secondly, so to modify the condition of the blood as to dispose it to the deposition of its fibrine. In carrying out these indications, it should be borne in mind that there are two opposite conditions of the system in which aneurism occurs ; in one there is a plethoric, and in the other an anemic tendency. The plethoric and initable state of system chiefly occurs in young subjects, in whom the progress of the disease is acute and rapid, attended by much impulse and excitability of the heart, and throbbing of the ai'teries gene- rally. The other condition of the system principally occurs in elderly people, in whom there are a feeble pulse, a quiet heart, a cachectic state of health, and a tendency to aiuemia ; in such a habit of body the disease makes slow progress. In these opposite conditions it is perfectly clear that the same plan of treatment cannot succeed; and that the constitutional means must accordingly be modified according to the state in which the patient is. In the acute or hypercemic state, the plan of treatment originally introduced by Yalsalva, and hence called by his name, by which plethora is removed, the VOL. II.34 ANEURIUM. irritability of the heart and the foj’ce of its action lessened, and the blood brought into a healthy condition, may be advantageously employed, in the modified manner that has been recommended and adopted by some modern Surgeons. Pellatan, and Hodgson, and Tufnell especially report very favourably of this treatment, and I have seen several instances in which it has proved decidedly beneficial. As recommended by Valsalva, this method of treatment was in- tended to carry out two important points ; 1, by a process of gradual starvation and depletion to reduce the quantity of blood in the system, the power of the heart’s action, and consequently the pressure exercised upon the walls of the aneurism ; and, 2, after fhe patient had in this way been reduced, the plasticity of the blood was to be improved by feeding him up m a gTadual and careful manner, so that the tendency to the deposit of laminated fibrine might be in- creased. . Valsalva endeavoured to carry out the first of these objects by sub- jecting the patient to small and repeated bleedings, and by gradually reducing the quantity of food that was daily taken, until it was lowered to half a pound of pudding in the morning, and a quarter of a pound in the evening. In this way the patient’s strength was reduced until he could scarcely be raised up in bed without fainting ; the quantity of food was then gradually augmented, so that the plasticity of the blood might be restored. It is seldom that Surgeons carry out Valsalva’s plan of treatment in the precise manner indicated by him; it is most commonly found to be more convenient to modify it somewhat according to the circumstances of the case, though the principles on which it is conducted are essentially the same. In adopting any‘constitutional treatment in cases of aneurism, the fu’st and most essential point to be attended to is, to keep the patient perfectly quiet in bed and free from all mental, emotional, or conversational excitement. The diet should at the same time be very carefuUy regulated, being gradually re- duced in quantity, and being made to consist principally of farinaceous food, Avith but a very small quantity of meat, but httle liquid, and a total absence of all stimulants. Perhaps the best regimen is that recommended by Belhngham, consisting of two ounces of bread and butter for breakfast, two ounces ot bread and the same quantity of meat for dinner, and two ounces of bread for supper, Avith about two ounces of milk or water with each meal, or occasionally sipped in small quantities. At the same time pingatives should be administeied, especiailly such as give rise to watery stools, and remove obstructions of the portal and renal systems ; with this view a scruple of the compound jalap powder may be given tAvice a Aveek. In some cases, if the heart’s action be particularly strong, recourse may advantageously be had to small bleedings •from time to time. Iodide of potassiiun, in doses A'arying from fiA^e to thirty grains three times a day has been given in several cases of intrathoracic and abdominal aneinism, especially by Chuckerbutty of Calcutta, G. W. Balfour of Edinburgh, and . Roberts of Manchester, and its good effects lend some Aveight to the supposed syiihilitic origin of many aneinisms. In a large proportion of the cases thus treated, the sufferings of the patients have been relieved ; there has been diminution of the size of the sac, and in several instances the cure luis been apparently perfect. The enforcement of the recumbent posture is, as Baltour rightly insists, of high importance as an adjuvant in this treatment. ThereSURGICAL TREATMENT OF ANEURISM. 35 sertainly appears to be sufficient e^ffilcnce to wan-ant a trial of the iodide m the •onstitutional treatmeiit of aneurism. tp • 7 udiciously ean-ying out these plans of treatment and modifying- them iccordin. to the circumstances of the case, consolidation of t le aneunsmal tumour may occasionally be produced ; or, if this be not attained, the progress of the disease ivill be very materially retarded. When aneurism occurs m old, feeUe, cacMctic, or a loAvering plan of treatment is altogether inadmissible : here, the blood bein deficient in fibrine, and the system in an irritable state from results follow such a course as will improve the plasticity of the blood, and reo-ulate the action of the heart. With this view, complete rest, the admnis- tratioii of the preparations of iron, a dry but nourishing meat diet, and the occasional employment of opiates to relieve pain and to quiet the system, will be attended by the best results. In aneurism occurring in elderly people, and amongst the poorer classes, this plan is perhaps more successful than any In the Local Treatment of aneurism but little can be done inth the view of checking its progress, except by the employment of direct surgical means. The application of ice to the smface of the tumoin- is said to have acted beneficially in some cases ; but it is a painful remedy, and may occasionally be attended by sloughing of the skui to which it is applied. When the pain attenchng the increase of the tumour is considerable, much relief may be obtained from the hypodermic injection of morphia, the application of bella- donna plasters, or the use of an embrocation composed of equal parts of oil and of the strong tincture of aconite. These means comprise the only local measures that can be adopted in those cases of internal aneiu’ism, which are beyond the reach of sm-gical interference. SITRGICAIi TREATMENT OF ANEURISM. In all those cases in which it is possible to delay with safety, no sui’g-ical proceeding should be undertaken for the cure of anem-ism until the patient has been subjected to proper constitutional treatment for some time ; the success of the more direct surgical means depending gTeatly, in the liypermmic forms of aneurism, on the heart’s impulse being lessened, and on the blood being brought into as healthy a state as possible; whilst, in the anaemic form of the disease, an increase in the plasticity of the blood is essential for the cure of the casefor, as the occlusion and consolidation of the sac, after siu’gical procedure, depend on the same conditions being induced that arc successful after medical treatment, the same constitutional means should be adopted in one case as in the other. Before proceeding to the employment of any direct surgical means for the cure of an external aneurism, it is necessary to ascertain that there is no internal aneiu-ism present, and that the heart is fi’ee from disease. From want of this precaution, it has happened that patients have died on the operating table at the moment when the artery was being ligatured, or that they have expired shortly afterwards, from the disturbance of circulation consequent upon the necessary surgical procedures. There is not a more interesting chapter in the history of Operative Sm-gciy3(> ANEURISM. than that winch records the changes that liave taken place and the progress that has been made in the treatment of aneurism. The older Surgeons were either afraid to meddle at all with an anemasm, and amputated the limb affected by it, or tried to restrain the progress of the disease by tight bandaging and direct iwessure, or had recourse to the troublesome, difficult, and dangerous operation of laying open the sac and ligaturing the diseased artery on each side of the opening in it. In 1785, John Himter substituted for the barbarous and dangerous methods of treating aneurism that had hitherto been adopted, the simpler and more scientific procedm-e of ligatiu’ing the artery in a healthy part of its course, above the sac, and thus directly cutting off the influx of blood into the aneurism. This operation midoubtedly constituted one of the greatest and most direct advances in Sm’gery that has ever been made by the single act of one man, and the “ Hunterian Operation ” continued for moi’e than half a century as almost the sole method of treating this formidable disease, when situated on an artery to which the operation was applicable. It was not until 1841-42 that the Dubhn Sm’geons, distinguished as they ever have been by their practical skill as much as by their scientific devotion to their art, inaugimated a new era in the treatment of this disease. For they found m practice, and they demonstrated by an elaborate pathological investi- gation and by a smgical argument, as convincing as it was exhaustive, that the coagulation of the blood by which an aneurismal sac is occluded and the disease cured, may as readily take place when the cuiTent of blood from the artery into the sac is interrupted hy the compression, as when it is an’ested by the ligature of the vessel. And they established triumphantly this great fact, that wherever the artery could be reached so as to admit of compression between the sac and the heart, the scalpel was no longer needed for the cure of this formidable disease. But the treatment of aneurism was destined to be still farther shnphfied, when Vanzetti showed that, by discarding all instimnents and by the simple pressure of the finger on the feeding artery, a coagulum might be formed, on the production of which in the sac the em’e of the aneurism essentially depends. And in addition to this, the fact was established, that in some cases adequate compression of the vessel and sac might be effected by simple flexion of the limb. Thus, then, we have had a continuous and progressive process of simplification in the treatment of aneurism, as it has been proved that instrumental compression maybe substituted for the hgature, that pressure with the finger or flexion of the hmb suffices for the deposition of that coagulum on which the cure of the disease depends ; and, still more recently, the sphere of the appheabihty of compression has been greatly extended by conducting it during prolonged ansesthesia. Another subsidiary means of treatment, but one certainly destined to play an important part in the management of some of the more mti-actable fonns of aneinism, is electro-piincture, by Avhich, as Cimselh and others have recently shown, consolidation of the contents of an aneurism may be effected so as to retard the progress of the disease, if not to cine it radically. We will now proceed to consider in detail these various methods of treat-37 SITUATION OF LIGATUEE. meiit. They fire as follows : 1. liayiiig open the sac ; 2. Ligature of the artery on the cardiac side ; 3. Ligature of the artery on the distal side ; 4. Compression by instruments ; o. Digital compression ; G. Flexion of the limb ; 7. Acupies- sure ; 8. Manipulation ; 9. Electro-puncture ; 10. Injection of the sac Avith coagulating fluids, M these various methods of treatment, however they may differ in their details, have, udth the exception of the fii-st, the same great principle in view, viz.: the consolidation of the aneurismal tumom- by the deposit of coagulum Avitliin it. When the process adopted is of such a nature as to lead to the slow deposit of coagulum, this will be found to be pale, firm and laminated, the active clot of Broca. When the deposit is rapid, it Avail be dark, soft and homogeneous, theJ^^^ss^Ve clot. Ligature.—The application of the ligatime to the feeding artery on the cardiac side of the aneurism, was almost the only method adopted by Siu’geons for the cure of the disease up to a recent date. The manner in which the ligatiu’e should be applied, and the various cautions respecting its use, have been sufficiently discussed (Vol. I., pp. 287, seq^.). The question as to the part of the vessel to Avhich it should be applied in aneiu'ism, remains for con- sideration ; and this inA^olves some important points. Situation.—There are thi-ee situations in which the ligature may lie apphed : 1, above and beloio the sac, by the old operation ; 2, on the cardiac side of the sac, by Anel’s (Fig. 359) or Hunter’s (Fig. 360) opera- tion ; 3, on the distal side of the sac, by Brasdor’s or Wardi’op’s operation (Fig. 361). 1. The Application of the Ligature on both sides of the Aneur- ismal Sac is seldom practised at the present day, when the anemism arises from disease of the coats of the A^essel; but in those cases in Avhich it occurs from traumatic causes, it may fr’e- quently be adopted as the best means of cure, even in aneurisms of the largest size, as has been mentioned in the Chapter on Traumatic Anemism. The older Sm’geons, however, Avere ac- quainted Avith this mode only of treating anem-isms. The mode of applying the ligatme to both sides of the sac is as folloAvs. After having an-ested the cireulation through the aneiu'ism, by compressing the artery leading to it, either by means of a tourniquet, or, where that is not applicable, by the pressure of an assistant’s fingers, the Surgeon slits up the sac, turns out the contained coagula and masses of laminated fibrine, and then, passing a probe upwards and doAvawards into the artery, through the mouth of the sac, ties the vessel on each side, immediately above and below the aperture. This operation, as performed by the older > ur,,eons on any of the laiger arteries, as the popliteal, Avas not only so difficult38 ANEURISM. in itself that Surgeons were seldom ■willing to undertake it, but was so fatal in its results, being commonly attended by secondary bajmoiTbage in consequence of the artery being ligatm-ed in a diseased part, or by diliuse inflammation, suppiu'ation, and gangrene in the deeper tissues of the limb operated upon, that recoTcry after its performance was considered a marvel, and most Sm-geons preferred submitting the patient to amputation at once. 2. The Ligature of the Artery on the Cardiac Side of the Aneu- rism, without opening the sac, was first done by Anel, in the year 1710, in a case of brachial aneurism. This operation, though attended with the risk of wounding or inflaming the sac, which was in close proximity to the seat of ligatm-e, constituted a considerable advance in the treatment of the disease ; inasmuch as it did not necessarily lead to the opening up of the aneurismal tumour, and to the dangers that were inseparable from that mode of procedme. As Anel, howev'er, performed his operation as a mere matter of convenience in a particular case, and Avithout the recognition of any ncAV principle of treatment being involved in it, it attracted but little attention at the time, and does not appear to have been repeated by any of the Siu’geons of his day. It was reserved for John Hunter to make the great improvement m opera- tiA’e surgery of ligaturing the artery at a distance from the sac, where its coats Avere healthy, and Avhere there Avas no danger of interference vdth the aneurism itself. In this way the objections to Anel’s operation Avere av^oided : for though, like Anel, Hunter tied the arteiy on the cardiac side only of the sac, yet he differed from him in doing so in a healthy part of its coiu’se, and at a considerable distance above the tumom, where the apph- cation of the ligature would be attended with less risk of htemorrhage, and AAuth no danger of opening, irritating, or inflaming the sac, which is insepai-- able from Anel’s operation. The folloAving are the reasons, given in Sir Everard Home’s own Avords, that induced John Hunter to adopt the operation that is now generally knoAvn in siu’gery as the Hunterian. “ Mr. Hunter proposed, in performing this operation, that the artery should be taken up at some distance from the diseased part, so as to dimmish the risk of hcBmorrhage, and admit of the artery being more readily seemed should any such accident happen. The force of the cii’culation being thus taken off from the aneurismal sac, the cause of the disease would, in Mr. Hunter s opinion, be remov'^ed ; and he thought it highly probable that, if the parts were left to themselves, the sac, with the coagulated blood contained in it, might be absorbed, and the whole of the tumoiu’ removed by the action of ' the animal economy, Avhich would consequently render any openmg into the sac unnecessary.” Hunter’s first operation was performed in December, 1785, in a case of popli- teal anemism. The femoral artery was ligatured rather below the middle of ^ the thigh, underneath the sartorius muscle ; and from that time his method 1 Avas almost exclusively employed by Surgeons in the treatment of anemism, 1 until the introduction of compression in 1842. , , e } The Effects produced upon an aneurismal tumour by the ligature ot the artery according to the Hunterian method, deserA'e cai-cful attention. The ;■ immediate effect, on draAving the ligature tight, consists in a cessation of pm- ,39 DISTAL LIGA TUBE. sation and bruit in the tumour, which at the same time subsides, becoming partially emptied of its blood. The supply of blood to the hmb being in a ‘>reat measiue cut oft’, it becomes numb and cold, with a diminution of muscular power The more remote eft'ects consist in an increase of the activity of the collateral circulation, by which the vitality of the limb is maintained. At the same time, and, indeed, hi consequence of this, the temperature of the limb often rises, until it becomes higher than that of its fellow. The consolidation of the aneurismal tumoui’ begins as soon as the ligatoe is apphed, and is usually completed in a few days, by changes taking place within it similar- to those that occm- in the spontaneous cure of the disease. This important change is effected by the gradual deposit of stratified and decolorised fibrine in concentric layers within the sac, and occasionally by the sudden coa- gulation of its contents. For the cure to be accomplished by the deposit of laminated fibrine, it is necessary that, though the direct fiow of blood through the tumour be an-ested by the hgature of the main trunk, some should yet be carried into it by collateral channels. This is a condition very favourable to the success of the ligatm-e ; for, if it happen that all the fiow of blood through the tumour is airested, coagulation of that which happens to be con- tained in it will ensue, and a soft yielding clot be formed, which is more likely to lead to unfavourable results than the fii’m products of slow coagulation. It is of importance to observe, that the proper consoUdation of the aneurismal tumoin, by the deposit of laminated fibrine, will occm even though a very considerable quantity of blood continue to fiow through it. In the Museum of University College there is an exceedingly interesting preparation that illus- trates this point. It is one in which Sir Charles Bell ligatmed the femoral artery for pophteal aneurism. The patient died a week after the operation, from erysipelas ; on examination, it was found, and is shown by the prepara- tion, that the femoral artery was double, and that, though only one portion of the vessel had been ligatured, the tumoin, which continued to be supplied by the other branch, was completely consohdated. Hence it would appear that, if one half only of the infiux of blood be arrested, obhteration of the sac by deposition of laminated fibrine may be expected to occm. After the anemis- mal sac has been thus occluded, it progressively diminishes in size, and is at last converted into a small fibro-cellular mass. The artery that has been ligatured becomes closed at two points—at the part deligated (Fig. 262, a), and where it communicates with the sac (Fig. 362, V). In both these situa- tions, it -will be found to be converted into fibro-areolai- tissue ; whilst between them there is an open space, through the medium of which the collateral circulation is freely earned on. 3. Distal Ligature.—In some cases in which the ligature cannot, for anatomical reasons, be applied on the proximal side of the anemism, as in the arteries about the root of the neek, it was recommended by Brasdor that an endeavour should be made to obliterate the anemism by ligaturing the vessel on its (kstal side. This operation, although proposed by Brasdor, was first practised by Ueschamps, and has been especially commented upon by Wardrop. In jninciple, it resembles the Hunterian operation, the object being to arrest so much of the flow of blood through the sac that the consolidation of this may take place in the usual way, by the deposit of laminated fibrine. In theANEURISM. 40 lunteriaii operation, this is effected Ijy deposit from the lessened quantity of blood that flows through the sac ; in the distal operation, it is sought to be accomphshed in the same way, and the success of the operation must necessarily depend, in a great measm-e, npon the extent to Avhich the flow of blood through the sac is interlered with. This operation, however, is rarely suecessM ; lor, independently of the ordinary dangers resulting from the appheation of the ligatm-e to a large vessel, the sac will continue to be distended with, and to receive the direct impulse of, the blood that is driven into it, though it be not transmitted through it. The natural result of the ligature would be, therefore, to increase the tension, of the sac, but, as Holmes points out, the en- largement of the collateral circulation opens, as it were, “ side- sluices ” to relieve this pressiwe, and consequently after a few hoiu’S or days the sac is usually found to be less tense than before the operation. Hence the progress of the anem’ism may be arrested for a time, but it will often speedily increase again, and may perhaps eventually destroy the patient by suppura- tion and sloughing. Of 38 cases in which this operation has been practised on the cai’otid artery, in 25 instances a fatal result more or less speedily followed the operation ; in the remaining 13 cases the patients sm’Hved the effects of the ligature of the artery, though in very few if any cases were they cured of the disease for which the operation was practised. This operation, however, will be considered more in detail in speaking of the particular cases in which it has been practised {vide Chap. xliv.). Indications and Contra-indications of Ligature.— Ligature of an artery for aneiu'ism, by the Hunterian method, succeeds best in those cases in which the tumour is circimi- scribed, of moderate size, slow in its growth, haHng a tendency to consolidation, and unaccompanied by much oedema of the limb. When the anem-ism is undergoing spontaneous cm-e, no surgical interference should be employed, but the case left to nature. In tins way it occasionally happens, dining the pre- paratory treatment of the disease, that the aneinism becomes consolidated. Before the Singeon proceeds to cut dovm upon an artery with the view of tying it, he should, as far as practicable, ascertain by a careful examination of it, whether it appears to be in a healthy and sound state, at the point at which he is about to tie it. He should feel along its course to ascertain if it be smooth, easily com- pressible, and natural to the feel; if it be hard, incompressible, indicatii e of calcification ; if it feel broader than natural; if a bruit be heard in it on applying the stethoscope ; if, in fine, there be evidence ol degeneration oi dilatation of its coats, great caution should be used in attempting to hgatiu-e it. Should the deligation of a diseased ai-tery become unavoidable, the antiseptic catgut ligatm’c would probably be the best material for the pm pose. e Fig. 3C2. — Fe- moral Artery liga- tured for PopUteal Aneurism, oblite- rated at a, the site of the Ligature, and at 6, where the Tumour has become consoli- dated and absorb- ed : between these points the Artery is open, and colla- teral branches en- iiU-ged.41 CONTRA-INDIGATIONS OF LIGATURE. ends bciii" cut short, and the wound closed over them, the chance of sloughing and of unhealthy uleeration of the vessel would be greatly lessened. It has occasionally, perhaps more frequently than the profession loiows, ap- pened to Surgeons that they have cut down upon an artery with the intention of tyinc it, and found it in so diseased a state that the application of the liga- ture was impracticable, and that it became necessary to close the wound without completing the operation. Liston and Aston Key have both had the candour to record such cases. In one case that happened to me in which fr was thought necessary to tie the superficial femoral for popliteal aneurism, i found, on cutting down on the artery, that there was a small aneiu’ismal dila- tation just below the giving off of the profimda, and a tubular dilatation of the artery below this, rendering the application of a ligatiu-e utterly impracticable. afterwards tied the external iliac, but iinsiiccessfriUy. It must be remembered that, in such cases as these, not only are the arterial coats softened and incapable of bearing the strain of the ligature, but the vein is usually adherent, and con- sequently liable to perforation in passing the aneurism-needle between it and the ai-tery. And even could the act of deligation be practised, secondary hiemorrhage would undoubtedly occur at an early period in an artery that is incapable of healthy adhesive union. All operation should be avoided when there is any serious disease of the heart, and in cases of multiple anemlsm where the second tumour is situated internally; but it has happened that two aneiu'isms in one limb, as of the popliteal and femoral arteries, have been cm’ed by one bgatiu’e applied to the external iliac. Two anemisms seated in corresponding parts of opposite limbs, affecting, for instance, the two popliteal arteries, may be successfully operated upon. But, if two aneurisms be seated on different parts of the body, as the axilla and groin for instance, at the same time, the aneurismal diathesis would be indicated, and it would certainly not be expedient to operate. In certain cases, the Hunterian operation seldom succeeds ; and these, there- fore, may be considered as unpromising to it. This happens in those instances in which it is necessary to apply the ligatiu’e very close to the sac, so as indeed rather to perfoivn Anel’s operation, as here there is the double danger of in- flaming or wounding the sac, and of interfering with the collateral circulation of the limb. Those cases, also, in which the aneinism is very acute in its progress, increasing rapidly with forcible pulsation, having very fluid contents, and a large mouth to the sac, into which the blood is consequently driven in a full wave at each pulsation of the heart, are rarely favourable for the irse of the ligatm’e, inasmuch as stratification seldom occurs. When the aneurism is situated in the midst of loose and very yielding tissues, as in the axilla, where it readily expands to a largo size, not being bound down by the siuTounding parts, suppuration and sloughing of the sac arc especially apt to occiu’ after ligature. AVhcn it is diffused widely through the limb, with coldness and a tendency to incipient gangrene, the circulation of blood through the part is so much choked that the deligatiou of the vessel will in all probability arrest it entirely, and thus produce mortification. 'WTaen arteries can be felt to be calcified, it is a question whether they can be safely ligatiu’cd, as in all pro- bability they will be cut or broken through by the noose, and the changes necessary for their occlusion will not take place. I’orter, however, recommends42 ANEUEISM. that the ligature should be applied in such cases, though I cannot hut doubt the propriety of this advice. When inflammation has been set up in the sac, with a tendency to suppuration of the tumour, it is a debatable question -whethei- the ligature should be applied or not. In these cases I agi-ec with Hodgson, that the artery should be tied ; for even if the sac eventually suppurate, there will be less risk to the patient if this event occur after the application of the ligatm-e, than if it happen while the artery leading into the tumour is pervious. If suppuration have ah'cady taken place in or around the sac, the application of the ligature above the inflamed tumour on the point of bursting would be worse than useless. In such cases, the hne of practice must be determined by the seat of the aneurism. If this be in the axilla, groin, or neck, it should be laid freely open, the coagula scooped out, and the artery tied above and below the mouth of the sac—a most formidable and doubtful operation, but the only one that holds out a chance of success. If the aneurism be in the ham or calf, amputation would probably be the best course to pm-sue. In some instances, there is no resoiu-ce left to the Sm’geon but to amputate. 1. Amputation must be performed when the aneurism is associated with carious bone or a diseased joint, as when a pophteal anemlsm has produced destruction of the knee. 2. If the artery be so diseased that it will not admit of the appHca- tion of a ligature, and the aneiu’ism be so situated, as in the ham, that it admits of amputation of the limb. 3. If the aneurism have attained so great a magnitude that it has abeady interfered seriously with the circulation through the limb, as indicated by considerable oedema, lividity, and coldness of the part, mth distension of the superfleial veins, it is a question whether the appheation of the hgature may not immediately induce gangrene, and whether the patient would not have the best chance of recovery by submitting to amputation at once ; this is more particularly the case when the aneurism, whether previously lai’ge or small, has become diffused with impending gangi’ene, when removal of the limb must not be delayed. 4. If gangrene have actually supervened, and the patient’s strength be sufficient to bear the operation, amputation should be done without delay. 5. If a diffused aneurism, whether suppiu’ating or not, in the lower extremity, have been opened by mistake for an abscess, there is no resoiu’ce left but immediate amputation. The ligature fails from various causes in a very considerable number of the cases in which it is employed for the cure of aneiu'ism. Thus, in 25G cases of ligature of the larger arteries for anemism, collected and tabulated by Ciisp, it would appear that the mortahty amoimted to about 22 pear cent. Poita flnds that, among GOO cases of ligature of arteries for diseases and injuiies ot all kinds, the mortality amounted to 27 per cent. It must be borne m mind, that these are collections of previously reported cases, and that, fr the unre- corded cases could be got at, the rate of death would, in all probability, be found to be much higher even than that above stated. Accidents after Ligature for Aneurism.—The accidents that may foUow the application of the ligature in a case of aneurism, are : 1, Secondary Hiemon’hage fr’om the seat of ligature ; 2, the Continuance oi t le te ° Pulsation in the Sac ; 3, the occurrence of Suppuration and Sloughing o c Tumour, with or ivithout Hiumorrhage from it; and 4, Gangrene o e Limb.43 MET URN' OF PULS AT I OX. 1. Secondary Haemorrhage from the seat oi ligature presents nothing peculiar, and has aheady been discussed in 'sol. I., p. 30b. * • i 2. The Continuance or Return of Pulsation in an Ancurismal Sac after the ligation of the artery leading to it, is an interesting phenome- non, and one that deser\-es much attention. When the Hunterian operation is snccessfidly performed, though the pulsation in the sac be entirely aiTested, a certain cpiantity of blood continues to be conveyed into and through it by the anastomosing channels, and it is from this that the laminated fibrine is de- posited by which the consolidation of the tumour is ultimately effected. This stream of blood furnished by rcgiugitatioii, or by transmission through the smaller collateral channels, is continuous, and not pulsatory; occasionally, howc\-cr, it is transmitted in sufficient quantity by some more than usually duect and open anastomosing branch, and thus gives rise to a continuance or to a retiun of the pidsation. It is interesting to observe that, in some of the cases in which this has happened, there has been a return of the bruit, but in the majority no sound appears to have been emitted. The period of the return of the pidsation in the sac after the ligature of the artery varies greatly. In by far the majority of cases, at least two-thirds of those in which it has happened, a certain degree of thriU or of indistinct pulsa- tion has been found in the sac shortly after the application of the ligatiue ; at all events, within the first twenty-foiu hours. This may be looked upon as being rather a fai'ourable sign than otherwise, as it is indicative of the free state of the collateral circulation, and generally soon disappears spontaneously, the sac undergoing consolidation. Next in order of frequency are those cases in which the pulsation retiuns in about a month or six weeks after the ligatiue of the artery, the collateral cuculation having been fuUy established, and, after continiung for some length of time, gradually ceases. It more rarely happens that the pulsation returns between these two periods ; that is to say, about ten days or a fortnight after the application of the ligatiue ; though in some instances the shght vibratory thrill, scarcely amoimting to a pulsation, which perhaps is perceptible a few hoius after an artery has been tied, gradually strengthens at the end of a week or ten days into as distinct and forcible a beat as had been noticed before the operation. In some rare instances the pul- sation has re-appeared after the lapse of some months, the aneiuismal tumoiu having in the meanwhile midergone absorption ; then indeed it may with justice be looked upon as constituting a secondary aneurism, and as indicating a reciUTence of the complaint. I he cause of the continuance or of the return of the pulsation in an aneiuismal sac, must be looked for in too great a freedom of the collateral circulation. Indeed, I consider it an essential requisite for the manifestation of this phenomenon, that there should be so free and direct a commuuication between the artery on the proximal side of the ligatiue, and that portion of the vessel situated between the ligature and the sac, or the sac itself^ as to enable the impulse of the heart to be transmitted in a pulsatory manner into the tiunoiu. Ho regurgitant blood coming upwards irom that portion of the aitcry which is distal to the sac, however free it may be, can communicate an impulse, as it neicr flows per saltum except in the special case of a continuous circle ol large anastomoses, such as are met ivith betivccn the arteries ivithinANEURISM. 44 the skiill, or in tlie pabuar and plantar arches. If any of the direct collateral or feeding vessels happen to be sufficiently large at the time of the operation to transmit the wave of blood, the pulsation in the sac will be continuous, or will return almost immediately after the application of the ligature. If they Idc at first too small for this, they may become enlarged as part of the anastomos- ing circulation, and then the pulsation wiU return so soon as their calibre is sufficient to transmit the heart’s impulse. Besides these conditions in the size and distribution of the vessels of the part, it is not improbable, as has been supposed by Porter, that certain states of the blood in some individuals may, from causes with which we are unacquainted, render it less liable to coagulate than usual, and thus dispose to a return of the pulsation in the sae, which remains filled with fluid blood. The phenomenon under consideration has been noticed in all parts of the body after the performance of the Hunterian operation, though it occurs with different degrees of frequency after the ligatime of different arteries, and is certainly of more common occinl’ence after operations for carotid aneurism than for any other form of the disease. Thus, of 31 cases in which the carotid artery has been tied for aneurism, I find that pulsation in the timiom- continued or returned in 9 instances ; Avhereas of 92 cases of inguinal anemism, in which the external iliac artery was ligatmed, the pulsation reemred in G cases only ; and in several of these it is interesting to note that there Avere two aneurismal sacs in the same limb—one in the groin, the other in the ham ; and that the pulsation, though permanently arrested in the popliteal, reemred in the in- guinal aneurism. In the ham and axilla, pulsation occasionally though very rarely recurs. This difference in the frequency of the reciurence of pulsation in different aneurisms, is evidently owing to the different degrees of freedom of communication that exist between the sac and the collateral branches in various forms of the disease ; thus, in a carotid aneiuism, the im- pulse of the heart may at once be brought to bear upon the contents of the sac, through the medium of the circle of Willis. But, in the case of inguinal, femoral, or popliteal anemism, the anastomoses, consisting rather of the in- osculations of terminal branches than of open communications between large trunks, are less liable to transmit the blood in a pulsatory stream. 1 or the same reason—the great freedom of the communication between the vessels of opposite sides—the pulsation has more frequently been found to continue un- interruptedly and distinctly, though reduced in force, after the ligatiue of the arteiy in carotid aneurisms, than in those in any other situation. The cases in which it retiuns after the cessation of a few horns only are perhaps as frequent in the groin and ham, as in the neck. In those instances in which the pulsation returns within the fii'st twenty-foiu hours after the hgature, it usually ceases again in a few days, though it sometimes continues a Aveek or tAvo. AVhen it recius at a later period, it is apt to last somoAvhat longer. Compression antecedent to the ligatiue may so enlarge the collateia vesse s as to favour a continuance or return of pulsation. I haAC once vUOAaii e pu sa tion continue, though very much lessened, in a popliteal aneurism, after the ligature of the superficial femoral, in a case in Avhich treatment by compression had unaAmihngly been tried for nearly three months. n ano er case, in which I tied the external iliac artery for popliteal aneurism, owing to the45 TREATMENT OF RECURRENT PULSATION. superficiiil femoral beinc: too diseased to admit of a ligature, the pulsation ceased completely for a time as I was tightening the ligature, but then re- turned, and became A'cry marked in a few hours. In this case compression had been unavailingly employed before the artery Avas tied. The iimjnosis of these cases is on the Avhole favourable, but feAV of them having eventually proA'ed fatal. Of 20 patients in Avhom pulsation recurred, I find that three died ; and in all of these the fatal result was occasioned by inflammation and sloughing of the sac. In all of the tliree instances, the pul- sation recurred Avithin the first tAventy-four hours. When it returns at a more advanced period, there is little risk to the patient, as it is usually readily amenable to proper treatment. A Secondary Aneurism is of extremely rare occurrence ; indeed I believe there are only tAA'O unequivocal instances of this affection upon record, both of which took place in the ham ; the original tumoim haA’ing disappeared entirely after operation, the secondary disease made its appearance after a lapse of six months in one case, and in the other after four years. It is of importance to distinguish between a secondary aneurism and secondary or recurrent pulsation in an aneurismal sac. The term ^‘secondary aneurism" should be restricted to those cases only in which an aneurismal tumour appears in the site of a former one, which has undergone consolidation and absorption after operation. The question may be raised, AA’hether aneurisms of this kind are in reahty secondary, or whether they may not originate in the dilatation of a portion of the arteiy contiguous to the seat of a former disease. It is certainly not very easy to understand hoAV an aneurismal sac that has once undergone consolidation and absoi-ption, can again become dilated into a pulsating tumour ; and I think it most probable that, although the consecutive aneiu'ism may be found in the same sm-gical region as the primary one, it in reality takes its origin from a slightly higher part of the artery, where the same structural changes may have been in progTess that determined the disease in the first instance at a loAA'er point. Double aneurism thus arising is, indeed, occasionally met with in the ham as a primary disease. I have seen a case in which an aneiu’ismal tumom* was situated in the ham, and another at or immediately above the aperture in the adductor muscle : if the artery in such a case as this had been tied before the second tumour had attained any magnitude, we can easily understand hoAv, Avhen this became dilated, it might have been considered to be a new enlargement of the original sac, whereas, in reality, it was nothing more than a new anem-ism forming in the close vicinity of the old one. The enlargement of an aneurismal sac ivithout pidsation, after the lio-ature of t e artery leading to it, is an interesting phenomenon, and one that mio-ht cause the true natimcof the tmnom-to be misunderstood, as it closely resembles m Its slow and gradual increase the gi-owth of a malignant tumour It is occasioned by the distension of the sac by the dark regurgitant blood broim-ht mto .fc through the distal end of the vessel, AAdthout sufficient force to clause Lots of casos of socoo- uai-y pulsation, this phenomenon ceases of tself in the course nf n weeka by the consolidation of the sac, in the sa.ne46 ANEVMISSL artery, from the deposition of lamellated hbrine. This tendency to consolida- tion of the tiimoiir may be much assisted by moans calculated to lesson the force of the impulse of the blood into the sac, such as compression of the arteiy above the point ligatm-ed, rest, the elevated position, and the cautious application of cold to the part; cold, however, must be carefully applied, lost as the vitality of the limb is diminished, gangrene be induced. At the'same time, direct pressure maybe exercised upon the sac, so as to moderate the flow of blood into it; this has in many cases succeeded in procm-ing consolidation of the tumom-, and may most conveniently be applied by means of a compress and narrow roller. This plan is especially adapted to popliteal and inguinal aneurisms, but cannot so well be exercised upon those situated in the^ieck. Oaie must be taken that the pressure be not at first too powerful, lest ganm’ene result; the object is not so much to force out the contents of the tumom, or to efface this, as simply to restrain and moderate somewhat the flow of blood into it. Should the aneurism be so situated that pressure can be exercised upon the artery above the point ligatm’ed, this should be had recourse to cither by the finger or by instrument, and will be both safer and more likely to be effectual than direct pressure. I succeeded in this way in cm-ing a very remarkable case of recuiTent pulsation in a popliteal aneurism. The patient, a man about thirty-five years of age, was admitted into University College Hospital for an aneurism, about the size of an orange, in the right ham. Treatment by compression was employed, without any effect being iDroduced in the tumour, for three months. During this period compression was employed in all forms—by Carte’s instrument, the weight, the finger, and flexion. I then ligatured the superficial femoral artery in Scarpa’s triangle. The pulsation was arrested in the tumour Avhen the hgatnre was tied, but returned in a slight degree in about an hour, and slowly increased, never becoming at all forcible, but being very distinct. The ligatm-e separated on the fourteenth day. The limb w'as bandaged, and a pad applied over the anem'ism without any effect; and the limb was raised, but still the incessant pulsation continued. Carte’s compressor was again applied to the common femoral artery, and used for about three hours in an intermittent maimer, when the pulsation finally ceased. In the event of the pulsation not disappeaihig under the influence of pres- sure, conjoined with rest, dietetic means, and the local application of cold, there are three courses open to the Surgeon : 1, To hgatnre the vessel higher up ; 2, to perform the old operation of opening the sac ; and, 3, to amputate, if the aneurism be situated in a limb. With regard to ligatiuing the artery at a higher point, I am not acquainted ■with any cases that throw much light on the probable success of such an opera- tion. AVe knOAV that the ligature of an artery high up for secondary hemor- rhage, after pre\uous dehgation of it, is a most disastrous procedure. But here the conditions are by no means identical Avith, or cA’cn similar to, those that accompany recun-ent pulsation. In tlic case of secondary hemoiThagc, there has usually not been time for the full deA'elopment of the collateral circulation ; Avhercas, in the case of recurrent jnilsation, many weeks AAmuld probably have elapsed before the second operation AAmuld become necessary, so that ample time Avould be giA’en for the establishment of the anastomoses ; andSLOUGHING OF THE SAC. 47 besides this, tlie very occurrence of the return of pulsation may be taken as an evidence of an nmisually free anastomosing circulation. ^ I think, therefore, that if such a case were by any possibility to occur, in which recurrent pulsa- tion could not be checked by the application of pressure, digital or instru- mental, to the artery above the point originally ligatured, aided by the other appropriate local and constitutional means that have been mentioned above, the Sm-geon would adopt the proper coimse by ligaturing the artery higher up, ex. (jr., the common femoral or external iliac, if the superficial femoral had been the one jn’eviously tied. In the event of this not being thought ad\is- able, he must choose between one or other of the two remaining operations, viz., amputation, or opening the sac. Of these measures, I should certainly prefer amputation, as offering the most favourable chance to the patient. The operation of opening the sac, turning out its contents, and hgatining the vessel supplying it, is in any circumstances a procedure fraught with the greatest danger to the patient, and full of difficulty to the Singeon, even when he knows in what situation to seek the feeding vessel. How much greater then must the difficulty be, when he is in uncertainty as to the point at which the artery enters the sac, and cannot know whether there he more than one arterial branch leading into it. In the event, therefore, of all other means failing, and of the pulsation in the tumour continuing, amputation is the only resource left to the Singeon. 3. Suppuration and Sloughing of the Sac.—When, after the ligatine of its supplying artery, an aueinism is about to suj)purate, instead of diminish- ing in size, it increases, with heat, pain, pulsation, and some inflammatory dis- coloration of the skin covering it. This gradually becomes thinned, and at last gives way ; the contents of the tumour, softened and broken down by the inflammatory action and the admixtine of pus, are discharged through the aperture in its wall, in the form of a dark pinplish-brovm or plum-coloured and often fetid fluid, intermixed with masses of soft dark coagula, or of the drier laminated fibrine, which may not -inaptly be compared in appearance to portions of raisins or dates. The escape of these matters, variously altered, may be accompanied or followed by the escape of florid arterial blood. This hmmon-hage, which is the great source of danger in the suppuration of an aneurismal sac, may occur in a sudden or violent gush at the time of the rupture of the tumour, by which the patient may at once be destroyed ; or it may continue in small quantities, which, after ceasing, recur from time to time, thus giadually exhausting the patient. It is this occurrence of secondary htemoiThagc that constitutes the principal danger after suppuration of an aneurism, which otherwise is not a soince of any very serious risk to the patient; about one-fourth only of the cases in which the sac has suppurated having had a fatal termination, and almost all those in which death resulted having proved fatal by hmmon-hage. The patients in a few remaining instances have been can-ied off* by some special accidents, such as the pressine of the sac on the pharynx or oesophagus, or the discharge of the contents of the tumour into the pleura or bronchial tubes. Haemorrhage is more liable to occur when suppuration takes place a few weeks after the ligature of the artery than when a longer interval has elapsed. That haemorrhage does not hapiien more fr-cqucntly after suppuration of the sac is very remarkable, and must be ovino-ANEURISM. 48 cither to the scaling .by adhesion or plugging by coagulum of the month of the aneurism, where it communicates with the interior of tlie artery. It is owing to this plugging also, that in many cases the fatal bleeding does not occur at the moment of rupture, but only after a lapse of some days, or even weeks, and then most usually under the influence of some incautious movement of the patient, by which the coagulum or adhesion is suddenly disturbed. Those cases arc most dangerous in which pulsation has returned in the sac after the ligature of the vessel, but before the supervention of suppuration ; as in these the tumour is so freely supplied with blood that, if it burst, fatal hiemorrhage will ivith certainty supervene. ° This accident is much frequent in some situations than in others, and is more liable to occur in aneurisms of the axiUa or groin, than in those of the ham or of the neck. The proximity of the ligatme and the necessary inter- ference with the sac in its application, especially in large axillary or inguinal aneurisms, is undoubtedly a frequent cause of this accident. The large size these tumoui's raj)idly attain, in consequence of the laxity of their areolar con- nections, also favours it. Until recently it was believed that the occmrence of simple coagulation, instead of gradual deposit of laminated fibrine, was an important factor m the production of suppimation of the sac ; but oim late experience of the treatment of aneurism by rapid compression clearly shows that the danger has been greatly exaggerated. In other cases it would appear that the fibrine,. though properly deposited, acts as a foreign body, and gi-^-es rise to inflammation and suppm-ative action in the wall of the sac and the siUTOunding areolar tissue. Besides this, it has been very justly remarked by Porter, that the excessive handling and frequent examination to which an aneurismal tumour occurring in a hospital patient is usually subjected, may induce inflammatory action and give rise to suppuration. The period at which suppimation of the sac may occiu* after the ligatme varies from a few days to as many months. In the majority of instances, it would appear to take place between the third and eighth Aveeks ; later than this it seldom happens, though it may do so after the lapse of several months, as in a case recorded by Sir A. Cooi>er, in which a carotid anemism suppurated at the eighth mouth. Treatment.—When an aneurism is suppm-ating, and is on the point of giA'ing Avay, it will be better to make an incision into it, so as to let out at once the broken down and semi-putrefied contents. Its cavity must then be di’essed like an ordinaiy abscess, with a view to its filling up by granulation ; Avhich, however, Avill necessarily be a slow process, in consequence of the gi*eat size and depth of the opening. During the whole of this time a tourniquet should be kept loosely applied upon the artery above the sac, so as to be tightened at any moment if bleeding take place. If htemorrhage have already supervened, the case is attended with immediate danger. In such a case as this, the first indication is clearly to an-est the immediate floAV of blood, so as to prevent the patient fr’om dying at once. This can best be accomplished by turning out the coagiAla and plugging the sac Avith lint or compressed sponge, retained in sihi by a firm graduated compress, and Avell applied roller. The hremorrhage having thus been arrested for a time, the Surgeon should take into considera- tion what steps should be adopted permanently to restrain it. In some cases.GANGRENE AFTER LIGATURE. 49 iiidccil though these are exceptional, the plug and compress may be sufficient to prevent arecm-rence of the bleeding ; but in general it will not do to trast to these means, unless the anatomical relations of the part be such as to pre- clude the possibility of adopting any more active measures. Ahu-ious plans suggest themselves to the Surgeon for the permanent sup- pression of the bleeding. The sac may be laid open, and an attempt made to li<rature that portion of the artery from which the blood issues. But this can scm-cely be expected to succeed, as, in the majority of the cases, the coats of the vessel being softened and pulpy, there would bo little prospect of its holding a ligature, even if it were possible to expose it before the patient perished of haimoiTliage. Indeed, though this plan has been se\eral times tiied, I am not aware that”by it the Siu-geon has ever succeeded in arresting the bleeding from a suppurating aneiu’ismal sac. The application of the actual cautery to the bleeding orifice would, I think, hold out a better chance, more particularly if the blood were poured out fr-om a collateral vessel of a small size. In this way Mon-ison, of Monte Video, suc- ceeded in aiTesting the bleeding of an aneiu'ism in the groin that had suppu- rated. Should this means, however, not suffice (and it is the only means that can be applied m many situations, as in the groin and axilla), there is no coiu*se left but, in those situations in which it can be done, either to ligatme the ai-teiy higher up or to amputate. The application of a ligature nearer the centre of the circulation, even though jnacticable, appears to me to be of very doubtfid utihty ; for the probability is, that the circulation through the limb, embarrassed as it must have been by the first ligature, and by the subsequent distension and suppuration of the sac, will be so much interfered with when the ai’tery is tied a second time, that gangrene will result ; or else that the collateral circulation, if sufficiently active to maintain the vitality of the limb, will also keep up the ha^monfrage fr’om the opening in the artery cofumunicat- ing -with the sac. In these circumstances, the only course left to the Stu’geon is amputation of the limb when the anemism is so situated that it can in this, way be removed. 4. Gangrene of the Limb.—The general subject of gangrene of a limb, following injury and ligature of the main artery, has already been described (vol. I., p. 310); and we have at present only to consider those cases in which’ it occins after the operation for aneurism. Causes.—If the aneurismal sac have attained a large size with great raijidity,, it may, by its pressure on the anastomosing vessels, or on the veins in its. vicinity (Fig. 3G3), produce such an amount of disturbance in the circulation of the limb, preventing the influx of arterial or obstructing the efflux of venous, blood, as to occasion a great liability to the occurrence of gangi’eue. But perhaps the principal source of danger consists in the aneurism 'becoming suddenhj and ividelg diffused, more particularly in those cases in which the anatomical relations of the anastomosing vessels are such, as in the ham, that they may readily and uniformly become compressed by the eflPused blood. In these cases, the additional embarrassment induced in the circulation of thc' limb by the ligature of its main artery Avill readily induce gangrene ; andlmnce- it is that, in diffuse aneurism of the lower extremity, ligature of the arter/is so- commonly folloAved ])y mortification.

Treatment.—The general preventive treatment of gangi-ene following the ligature of the artery for aneurism must be conducted on the same principles as when it arises after the ligature of arteries generally (vol. I., p. 311). But some special modifications of it are required, so far as the aneimism is con- cerned. When the gangrene occurs from the pressure of the sac upon the ac- companying vein, it has been proposed to lay the tumour open, and to tmm out its contents, thus removing the compression exercised by it. The danger of such a proceeding consists in the probability of the occurrence of hmmorrhage from the opening made into the sac, and in the risk attending suppuration set up in the sac ; yet it would appear that, in two cases in which this practice has been adopted, no bad results followed. Thus, Lawrence has related a case of difiPused aneurism of the popliteal artery, in which this ^fian Avas had recom-se to Avith the best results ; and Benza has recorded a case of popliteal anem'ism in which the same practice Avas adopted in consequence of great oedema and iiicipient gangrene of the foot; after the extraction of a quantity of ' fiesh-like fibrine from the sac, the patient made an excellent recoA'ery. These cases would certainly justify the Surgeon in adopting such a course Avhen the danger of gangrene is imminent, and dependent on the size and pressiu’e of the tmnour.

The employment of direct pressure on the anemism was almost naturally suggested as a means to counteract the extension of the disease by the pressure of the blood from Avithin, and has consequently been applied from a very early period in the treatment of the affection. This plan of treatment AA-as first employed by Bourdelot at the close of the seventeenth centiuy ; afterwards by Genga, Heister, Guattani and others. These Surgeons made the pressime directly upon the sac ; and Guattani and Flajani relate seA^eral cures that they effected in this Avay ; but the method Avas so uncertain in its results, and so dangerous, fr’om inltating and inflaming the sac, that it fell into disuse. The French Siugeons introduced a modification of the pressiue plan, by laying •open the sac, clearing out its contents, and applying the pressure directly over the opening into the vessel. Deschamps exposed the artery leading to the sac, and compressed this Avith an instrument which he termed the “ presse-artm’e.” These barbarous modes of treatment, however, Avere entfrely set aside by the facihty and eomparative success of the Hunterian operation • and compres- sion in aneurism Avas rarely practised by Sm-geous after the great step made by John Hunter in the treatment of this disease. Yet Ave find that John Hunter himself, Blizard, and Freer attempted, though Avith but little success, to cure this disease by pressure on the artery leading to the sac. Pelletan and Dubois appear to have been the fii’st who applied the pressure to the artery aboA'e the sac, instead of to the aneurism itself; this Avas in 1810. After this period, various attempts were made methodically to treat aneurisms in this Avay ; but the merit of haAong introduced the practice of ■compression in the treatment of aneurism into modern sm’gery, of haAin. gi\'en it a definite place in our art, and of having established the true principles on Avhich it acts, incontestably belongs to the Dublin Siu’geons ; amongst whom the names of Hutton, Bellingham, Tufriell, and Carte deserve especial mention. Principle of Compression.—In the early trials of the cure of aneurism by compressing the artery on tlie cardiac side of the tumour, the Singeoiis who employed this method acted on an erroneous theory ; and, the principle not being understood, the practice was bad. It Avas supposed that it Avas neces- sary, in order that a cure might take place, that the iclioU flow of blood through the artery should be entirely arrested ; that inflammation of theA^essel at the point compressed should Ijc set up ; and that the consolidation of the aneurism depended upon the obstruction of the vessel consequent upon this52 Fig. SC-l.- iSae of Aneurism cured by Coni])ressioii: Ue- ))Osit of Laminated Fibrine. ANEURISM. employment of such violent and forcilde com- Lnn ^ of exciting inflammation in the artexy, that the patient could seldom bear it for a sufficient length of time to effect a cine ; sloughing of the skin commonly resulting from the severity of the pressure to which it xvas subjected. To the ffublin Surgeons belongs the veiy great merit not only of having pointed out the eiTor of this doctrine, but of having distinctly laid down as the piinciple of the pi’actice, that, in the majority of cases, the aneurism was cui’ed, when the arteiy leading to it was compiessed, in pi’ecisely the same way as when a spontaneous cure takes place, or when the Hunterian operation is per- foi’med ^viz., by the deposit of sti’atified fibrine in the sac, and by the consequent consolidation of this (Fig. 3G4), aided by the contraction of the walls of the sac ; and that, as in the case of ligature of the vessel, it was not necessary that the whole of the cfrculation through the artery should be entirely and permanently airested, but merely that it should be lessened in quantity and force to such an extent as to be compatible with the deposition of laminated fibrine in the sac ; and it was clearly shown by examination after death that, if the pressxu’e were properly conducted, the artery was in no way injured or occluded at the part compressed. The recognition of the true principles on which compression of the arteiy leading to the sac cures the aneiu’ism, has led to important results; for as the severe pressure that was formerly considered necessary is now known not only to be unnecessaiy, but often to be absolutely injurious, no amount of compression is exercised beyond what is requisite to restrain and moderate the flow of blood into the sac ; no attempt being made to compress the artery so severely as to lead to its oblitei-ation by inflammation. But, although, where the pressime is moderate or the anastomosing circula- tion fr’ee, the consolidation of the contents of the sac takes place in the way that has just been described, it would be an error to suppose that this is the process by which the aneurism becomes cured in all cases in which recourse is had to compi’ession. There can be no doubt that in some cases, where consolidation has taken place in a few hours after the employment of pressime, coagulation of the contents of the sac has suddenly occiuTed ; and this sudden coagulation, which at one time was dreaded by Siugeous, has been found by increased experience to be in the highest degree advantageous, as leading to a more rapid and equally certain cure of the aneurism. In the tubular fonn of aneurism, which is fiir less fr-equent than the sacculated in the extremities, the cure aixpears to take place rather by the gradual contraction of the partially emptied sac than either by the slow deposit of laminated fibrine, or by the rapid and almost sudden coagulation of its con- tents. The sac gradually shrinks, and shreds of fibrine only are found adherent to its sides. But although I behex'e that the condition of the aneurism, whether sacculated or tubular, has a considerable influence upon the mode in which the compression acts in effecting a cure, and also upon the time that is occupied in the treatment, this being much shorter in the sacculated than in the tubularapplication of COMPRESSOP. S3 form of the disease ; yet there can be no doubt that this is also materially influenced by two other circumstances—viz., the condition of the blood within the sac, and the completeness of the compression. AVhen the sac is filled with fluid blood, and the compression is not im- interruptedly complete, the sac appears to empty itself to a considerable extent, and eventually to consolidate by the deposit of laminated fibiine. But, if the sac already contain some solidified layers, and the compression be continuous and complete, the coag’ulation of the remaining fluid part of its blood is apt to take place rather suddenly. But in all cases the contraction of the sac, consequent upon the an-est or restraint of the ciu-rent of blood into it, is an important element in the cme. Illustrative of this mode of cime, there is a prepai-ation in the Museum of University College (Fig. 3G5). From all this, then, it would appear that the consolidation and em’e of an anemlsm by com]n’ession may and does take place in three different ways : 1, by the slow deposit of laminated flbrine ; '2, by rapid coagulation of the contents of the sac ; 3, by contraction of the sac. The particular mode of ciu’e ^vifl. depend upon the completeness of the compression and the more or less perfect arrest of the blood in the sac, the plasticity of that blood, and the shape of the anemism. Circumstances influencing Success. — The success of the treatment by compression depends gveatly upon a scrupulous attention to a number of minor ch’cumstances, which, though each be trifling in itself, become of importance when taken as a whole. Dming the' whole of the treatment, also, the patient’s general health should be attended to in accordance wdth those dietetic and medical principles that have already been laid down in speaking of the con- stitutional treatment of the disease, having for their object the increase of the fibrination of the blood. The irritabihty of the heart and arteries must also bo. subdued, and the irritation of the system lessened, by the use of opiates or of chloral; and the patient should be put into a comfortable bed, mth firm and well-secured pillows and mattresses, so that his position may not be changed. As it is principally hi anemism of the lower extremity that com- pression can be employed, we shall proceed to describe the method of its application here. Application of the Compressor.—The thigh should, if necessary, be shaxed, so as to remove all hair. The skin should then be powdered, and the limb bandaged with a soft roller ; a pad being laid on the tumoiu’. Pillows must then be comfortably arranged under it, the knee being semi- flexed. Much of the success of the treatment will depend upon the kind of instiument used. The ordinary horse-shoe, or Signorini’s tourniquet, was the one first employed, and this will, in many cases, answer the piu-pose perfectly well; Iiut, as it is somewhat difficult to regulate the pressure with this instru- ment, and as it is not unfrequently exorcised too powerfully, it has generally given place at the present day to the very ingenious apparatus of Carte, which, as It substitutes an elastic force derived from vulcanised India-rubber bands for the unyielding pressure of the screw, accommodates itself better to the limb, Fig. 365.—Sac of Tubular .iVjieurisiu cured by Compres- sion : Conti-action of Sac, and iiTegular Dexiosit of Fibrine.ANEURISM. 54 and is less likely to produce injurious compression. This instrument, as well 5is the other contrivances ■which ha'^'c at various times been invented for the treatment of aneurism by compression, are dcscril)ed by Bellingham and Tufnell, in their works on this subject, to which I must refer for a fuller account than I can here give. In applying the compressor, especial care must be taken that it is Avell padded in every part, so as not to gall the skin. In some of the early cases in which I saw compression employed in London by means of the horse-shoe tourniquet, much inconvenience resulted from want of attention to this parti- cular. The tendency to fretting of the skin is much lessened by powdering the limb ; and the removal of the hairs by sha-ving diminishes materially the in’itation produced by the instrument. In order to keep up continuous pressm’e, and at the same time to prevent any one part of the skin fr-om being- in juriously galled, it is of very gi-eat consequence that two mstruments should be used at the same time, so that when one is screwed down the other may be loose; these instruments need not be placed closely together. If the anem-ism be in the ham, it will be sufficient for one (Fig. 3G7) to be applied to the groin, whilst the other (Fig. 36G) is put upon the middle of the thigh (Fig. 3G8). In using the instrument, the gi-eat point, as Tufnell most properly remarks, is to con- trol the circulation ivith the minimum of pressime. In order to do^ this, the first instrument should be screwed doAvn so that all imlsation ceases in the timiour, but still not so tightly as completely to an-est all the flow of blood through it. As the pressure exercised by this becomes painful, the second one must be screwed tight, and then the flrst compressor may be slackened. In this way an alternation of pressiu-e can be kept up without much pain or inconvenience. If possible, the patient should be taught how to manage le instrument himself, and will often And occupation and amusement in doing so. I’ig. 30C.—Compressor for the Middle of the Thigh.

If, however, it excite much pain or imtation, as it does iii some subjects, it may be necessaiy to give opiates or chloral hydrate. The pressure should, if possible be continued during sleep ; but if it prevent the patient from taking his natural rest, the suggestion made by Tuf- nell, of unscrewing the instrument slightly, and, when the patient is asleep, gently tightening it again Avithout aAvakeniiig him, may ad- vantageously be adopted ; it is indeed sui-prising how very little unscrewing Avill relieve the pain of the compression. A large cradle should be placed over the patient’s body, so that the weight of the bed-clothes may be , taken off the apparatus, and that the patient may manage it Avithout risk of disturbance. Should there still be much uneasiness, the instrument might be taken off for a feAV hoims, and compression kept up in an intermittent manner. Even in such circum- stances as these, consolidation of the sac may ensue. In some cases, where, from the situation of the aneurism, deep and severe pressme is required to control the circulation, the pain becomes so miendur- able that the patient cannot submit to the treatment sufficiently long for a good effect to be produced. In such cases opium or chloral hydi’ate may be given Avith advantage, so as to enable the patient to bear the pressure. But . in some instances more complete narcotism is necessary for him to endure it. In these cir- cumstances, chloroform becomes a most useful adjunct; and by maintaining the anaesthesia for soA'cral hours, the amount and duration of pressme requisite to effect a rapid cure may be maintained. In this Avay W. Mmray of NeAvcastle-on-Tyne—to Avhom is due the merit of employing prolonged anaesthesia as an ad- jimct to compression—cured an aneiu'ism of the abdominal aorta by keeping up pressure on that A’essel for five hours under chloroform. Heath of the same tOAvn cured an aneurism of the external iliac by compressing the abdominal aorta for seven hours under chloroform; Mapothcr ol Dublin treated an ilio-femoral aneurism suc- cessfully by compressing the common iliac artery for four and a half hours ; and LaAvson treated an Fig. !i09.—P.

The employment of a imgM may sometimes be advantageously substituted for the clamp, and often occasions less distress to the patient. For this puimosc the apparatus fFi<^s. JlGi)) will be found veiy useful. ° A very simple compressor is Tufhell’s compressor, represented in Figs. 370, Fig. 3V0.—Tufiiell’s Compressor. 371. It consists of little more than a truss-spring, with a pad to compress the artery, and straps to fix it in its place, and increase, by being tightened, the force of the compression. The Effects upon the tumour vary considerably. In some cases it rapidly and suddenly solidifies; more commonly, however, this is a gradual process, the aneurism becoming more jDainful and solid, with less pulsation and iiruit. As the solidification takes place, there is usually some restlessness, a feeling of general uneasiness, and of constitutional disturbance, which is best quieted by opiates. As the j>ressixre is continued, and the tumoin begins to harden, the anastomosing vessels enlarge, with a good deal of burning pain in the limb generally, and arterial pulsations in situations where usually none are felt. The abnormal pulsation, in these cases, is always found to occur in much the same situations, the same vessels aixpearing to midergo dilatation. Thus Tufnell has made a remark, Avhich I have had more than one opportunity of xerilying, that, in the treatment of j)opliteal anemism by compression, three57 duration of compression. artei ics mil be foimcl to bo enlarged, one of avhicli passes over tlie centre of the Unnour, another over the head of the fibula, and the third along tte inner edge of the patella ; he also states that the severe burning pam which is felt in these Fi". 371.—Tufiiell’s Comiiressor applied. cases is owing to the artery accompanying the commmiicans peroitei nerve being enlarged. After complete solidification of the tumom* has taken place, the compression ought to be continued for at least forty-eight hom’s, so as to secure against the occiuTence of a relapse. The Duration of the Treatment varies very greatly. In some cases, as above stated, the tumour has become solidified in a few hoiu’s or in two or three days. In other instances, the treatment has required to be protracted for more than three months before a cime has resulted. Of 2C cases of femoral or popliteal aneurism cured by compression in the London hospitals, the average time, according to Hutchinson, was nineteen days. Much of course will depend, in this respect, on the constitution of the patient, and on the condition of the tumour ; those circumstances which are most fa^'ourable to the spontaneous cure of the aneurism will also influence the rapidity of the cure by compression. There are, undoubtedly, certain conditions of the blood in Avhich it is little disposed to coagulate, and in these cases the duration of the treatment will necessarily be prolonged. So, also, when the aneinlsm is tiibular, we must expect that the blood Avhich passes freely through it in the direct current of the circulation will be slower in undergoing those changes that lead to its consolidation than when the disease is sacculated, and thus contains a residuum of blood that is not so directly influenced by the current through the sac. In the early days of the compression treatment, there was an indisposition on the part of Surgeons to apply it very effectually and firmly.ANEUlUS2f. 58 and a longer time was expended over it than is now generally the case ; and the example set by Murray, with regard to abdominal aneurism, has been followed with success in respect to the femoral, popliteal, and other Ibnns of the disease, the conipressor being screwed down tight on the artery so as com- pletely to arrest for the time all circulation through the sac, the patient kept under chloroform, and the cure elfected in a few hoiu’s. Applicability.—Of the great value of compression in the treatment of aneurism, there can be no doubt; more especially when the tumour is situated in the arteries of the loAver extremity below the middle of the thigh. In aneurisms occurring in the vicinity of the trunk, as in the iliac, the carotid, subclavian, and axillary arteries, it is generally not so applicable ; although, as we have already seen, aneurisms in the groin have been cured by compression of the abdominal aorta, or of the iliac artery. Spontaneous anemism is extremely rare in the upper extremity; and, as the traumatic forms of the disease which occur here generally require that the sac should be laid open, it is seldom found necessary to have recoiu'se to it in this part of the body, though it may be and has been successfully applied to the brachial artery. The gTeat question with regard to compression appears, after aU, to be whether it possesses any special advantages o^'er the ligature, in the treatment of those aneurisms in which its emj)loyment is practicable. The principal objections that have been urged against compression are, that its employment is moi’e painful and tedious than the use of the ligature ; and that those cases that are unpromising to the ligature, or that require amputation rather than deligation of the artery, are equally mifa's-oiuable to compression, and cannot be saved by its employment. To these objections it may with justice be answered, that the pain attendant on the employment of compression depends very greatly upon the skill and care with which the apparatus is applied and managed throughout, as well as upon the kind of instnunent used, being certainly much dimim’shed when Carte’s elastic compressor is employed ; and that, as has already been shown, the pain may be overcome by the use of aucEsthetics. With regard to the relative tediousness of the treatment under the two plans, it would aj>pear that in reality there is but little difference ; for although some cases, in which compression is used, are prolonged over a considerable space of time, yet they do not occupy more than is often consumed when accidents of "Naiious kinds follow the use of the ligature ; and it not nnfrequently happens in com- pression, but can never occm’ after the employment of the h'gature, that the patient is cured of his disease in a few hours or. days. Taking, however, the averages, Ave find that in the Dublin cases the treatment lasted twenty-five days, and in the London cases but nineteen, and this is not very different froin what happens Avith the ligature ; for, of 54 cases recorded by Crisp, iLich the femoral artery was tied, the average time for the separation ot in Av th UgatiiT™ to this a week more be a<MeA tor the closure of the wound, and for the treatment of the various accidents often accompanying and following ligature, we should pio a y ic wi in e mai,, and yet only bring the duration ot the treatment of the two methods to the “Tfto ali.

Of the b cases in which the artery was ligatured, 142 were cured, 40 died, 0 were amputated, in 10 the sac suppurated, and in 2 gangrene of the foot occnrrec. Thus the deaths after ligature were in the proportion of 1 to 4, and the failures or serious accidents in that of 1 to 3, showdng clearly a very con- siderable preponderance in favour of the treatment by compression. Besides this, in many patients Avho recoA’ered after the ligature, various accidents, such as gangi-ene, erysipelas, secondary hfemorrhage, &c., resulted as the direct consequences of the treatment; and these do not happen when pressure is employed. The perfect safety of the treatment by compression has been fully confirmed by the statistics collected by Holmes, and published in his lectures on the Surgical Treatment of Aneurism ; but the proportion of success is not so great as in Bellingham’s cases. Of 124 cases of compression for popliteal aneurism collected fi’om the records of British hospitals for a period of 10 years, 66 suc- ceeded and 58 failed. Hone died directly fi’om the consequences of the operation. Of the 58 failures, 44 underwent ligature of the femoral, in 8 amputation w^as performed, one died of plemisy, and the subsequent history of the remainder Avas uncertain. Thc failmes were, therefore, 1 in 2'1. On the other hand, of 77 cases, in which the femoral was tied directly, 11 died, or 1 in 7. In 1 gangrene occurred, but the patient recovered, and in 1 secondary hmmorrhage Avas successfully treated. The 11 deaths were caused as follows : pymmia 3 ; Avound of vein and phlebitis 2 ; secondary haemorrhage 2 ; gangrene 1 ; small pox and disease of the kidneys 1 each, and 1 Avas uncertain. If compression fail, ligatm-e may often be advantageously applied ; in some cases Avith a better prospect of success than if compression had not preArously been tried, that treatment having caused the collateral circulation to eidarge, and thus lessened the tendency to gangrene. If, however, avc take the general average of those cases that have been submitted to ligature after the failure of compression, we shall find that the result is not so satisfactory as AA'hen the ligature has been employed as the primary method of treatment. Thus I find that, out of 40 cases in AAdiich the ligature was employed after compression had i'ailed, there Avere 16 deaths. This is probably not so much due to the previous employment of compression, as to the same causes interfering Avith the consoli-ANEURISM. 6o elation of the tiunour after the ligature that liad pre\’eutccl tlic success of the couipression-trcatmcut. AVith regard to the Ihcility of ligaturing an artery such as the femoral, after compression has been tried and foiled, it must be admitted that the difficulties are increased. The sheath of the vessels is apt to become tliickcned, infiltrated, and the artery and vein perhaps less easily separable than when pressure has not pre^dously been employed. In fact, it mnst be said, that in such cases the Surgeon has iiot to do with a ■s’irgin artery. It shonld also not be forgotten that in some cases, as when aneurism is com- pheated with heart-disease, or occurs in a very broken and unhealthy constitu- tion, in Avhich the operation necessary for ligatime would scarcely or not at all be admissible, compression may be safely employed. After carefully considering the relative merits of the two plans of treatment, I think we may conclude that, though in some few cases neither ligature nor compression can be adopted, and amputation is the sole resomce, yet in others compression can be employed when it would not be safe to have recourse to the use of the ligatm-e ; and that, in all ordinary cases of femoral and popliteal aneurism especially, compression should be preferred to the ligatm-e, inasmuch as it is not a more tedious, and an infinitely safer method of cm-e. At the same time, it must not be forgotten that its success depends very gi-eatly on the continuous care bestowed upon the case during the progi-ess of the treatment. Digital Compression.—Shortly after the introduction of the treatment of aneurism by instrumental compression, the fingers were used as an adjunct to the mechanical means in use. Thus Greatrex, in 1845, directed a patient to keep up compression by means of the fingers, where the toimiiquet had been used, and required to be loosened. In the following year (184G) Vanzetti, then Pro- fessor of Surgery at Charkoff, tried, but unsuccessfully, to cm-e a lai'ge popliteal anem-ism by compression of the femoral with the fingers only, continued for two days. It was not until seven years later, when Professor at Padua, that Vanzetti had an opportunity of putting this method successfully into practice, and to establish it as a distinct means of curing aneurisms. But although this merit is undoubtedly due to Vanzetti, ive must credit Knight of Newhaven {U. S. A.) with the first successful case—he having, in 1848, cured a very laige popliteal aneurism by digital compression, maintained for forty hours. In this plan of treating- anem-isms, no apparatus of any kind is used ; but the circulation through the artery leading to the tumour is controlled by the pressure of the finger. In order to carry it out efficiently, there must be relays of assistants, each one of whom compresses the vessel for about ten minutes at a time. The pressure should be apphed in the way that is represented in Ing. 5, Vol. I., p. 35. The fotigue may be very materially lessened by placing a six or eight lb. weight on the compressing- finger. With such aid each assisfout may readily keep up the pressm-e for half an horn- at a time. So soon as his fingei-s become fatigued, but before he relaxes the pressin-e, aiiothei assistan presses the vessel; and thus the circulation through it may be mini eiiiip ec j controlled. In this way aneurisms of the popliteal artery, in the orbit, at the bend of the arm, and in the groin, hai'e been success y rca ec ic tumour having in some instances become consolidated in a eii ouis.6i FLEXIOK cftecfc of digital compression and the rapidity of cure, would be increased by the application°of direct pressure to tlie tumour, or by manipulation and by the nrmious employment of proper constitutional means. It might be very advan- tageously conjoined with the treatment by flexion ; but its great advantage seems to be, that it is applicable to arteries, as at the root of the neck, to Avhich it might be difficult to apply any kind of compressor, or when the Surgeon is so placed as not to be able to obtain such an apparatus. Esmarch’s bloodless method has been successfully employed in the treat- ment of a popliteal aneurism by Dr. Walter Reid. The bandage and tubing were applied in the usual Avay, up to and on the uhddle of the thigh. The bandaire Avas then taken off, and the circulation airested for fifty minutes. The patient complaining of pain, a Carte’s compressor was substituted for the elastic tubing, when it Avas found that all pulsation had ceased in the sac. The compressor, hoAvever, was used as a precautionary measiu’e for a day or two lon^'cr, lest the iieAvly formed clot should be broken doAvn, and washed away before it had had time to toughen, and the sac to contract. The cure aa as complete and permanent. This means is applicable to many external aneu- risms, and CAudently deserves a further trial. It acts, like rapid comj)res- sion, by the coagulation of the aneurismal blood, not the lamination of its fibrine. Flexiox.—The treatment of aneurism by the flexion of the contiguous joint is a method that is scarcely applicable to any other form of the disease than the pophteal. The history of this plan of treating aneurisms is interesting, as an illustration of the gradual steps by which Surgery usually arrives at its ultimate results. It had been long known to Surgeons that the pulse at the Avi’ist might be arrested by the forcible flexion of the forearm on the arm ; and Malgaigne and Pdchet had recommended this means for the arrest of hemor- rhage from the brachial artery and the arteries of the forearm when wounded. Fleiuy—a distinguished French naval Simgeon—having succeeded in curing a wound of the brachial artery by forced flexion of the elbow, aided by dhect compression, and one of the radial by flexion of the wrist, published in 184G a memoir, in which he stated, as a conclusion from his observations, that any aneurism of the foreaim or leg might be treated by means of flexion of the hmb in AAhich it Avas situated. To A. Thierry is due the honoui’ of having been the first to cure a traumatic aneiu’ism of the bend of the arm by flexion of the limb. This was in .—{Ricliet, Diet, ch Mkl ct da Chinmjic, Vol. II., p. 338.) In 1857, Mannoir of GencA'a apph’ed the flexion-treatment to a large aneurism of the ham. Forced flexion could not be borne on account of the pain it occasioned, and the j)atient AA-as therefore alloAved to Avalk on crutches Avith the leg bent, and supported in a kind of stirrup attached to the opposite shoulder. In less than three AA-eeks the cure Avas effected, Avhich Mannoir found a year aftenvards to be permanent. In the foUoAving year, 1858, Mr. Hart applied this method of treatment successfully in a case of popliteal anciu-ism, and to him is due the merit of haA’ing been the first to introduce it into this country. _ Flexion is necessarily only applicable to arteries situated at the bend of joints, as the elbow or ham, in Avhich the circulation can be directly controlled by bending the limb, or in traumatic aneurisms in the limbs bcloAV these joints.ANEURISM. 62 in M liicli the flow of blood tlivougb the feeding artery can be stopped in the same way. Its application is therefore somewhat limited, and its use is still further restricted by the pain and insupportable annoyance occasioned in many cases by forced flexion of the limb, necessitating, as in Mannoir’s case, a relaxation of the method, which, however, was still effecti^■e in curing the aneurism. Nothing can be simpler than the details of this plan. It consists, in the lower limb, in bandaging the limb and then gradually flexing the leg upon the thigh, so that the heel is brought up towards the buttock, where it is retained by a strap or bandage. The patient is at the same time confined to bed, and put under proper constitutional treatment. By this means, the popliteal artery being bent at an acute angle, the circulation through it is nearly, if not com- pletely arrested ; and the obstacle to the flow of blood is still further increased by the compression of the tumour between the posterior flat surface of the femur and the upper part of the calf. In this way the anem'ism is most favourably situated for the consolidation of its contents, which, in the recorded cases, has often taken place at an early period. The principle on which the cure is effected in these cases appears to be, that by flexion the artery leading to and fi’om the sac, and the aneiu’ism itself, are so compressed that retardation of the circulation ensues, and deposition, of laminated fibrine takes place in the usual way. The compression by flexion, like every other method of treating anem-isms, occasionally fails. It is most likely to be attended by success in those cases in which the aneurism is small, situated low in the popliteal space, and in a young •or middle-aged subject, Avho can bear the continued flexion without much inconvenience. When flexion is not sufficient of itself to cm-e an aneurism, it may very advantageously be had recourse to in addition to other methods of treatment, more especially with that by digital compression. The statistics of the treatment by flexion require to be carried down to the present time. Those published by Fischer in 1870 comprised 57 cases. Of these 28 were cined—20 being by compression alone ; and in 29 the method failed. COMPEESSION BY ACUPRESSURE of the main artery leading to the sac is a means that, I think, might in certain cases be temporarily employed with ad- vantage, and the consolidation of the aneinism thus obtained in cases where compression by the ordinary methods, digital or instrumental, is not piacticable. With this vieAV a long and strong curved needle, such as the stilet of a rectum- trochar, might be dipped deeply under the artery and vein, e.g., the common femoral, and the artery compressed against this by means of a cork and twisted suture for several hours—the vein being left free. The patient might be kept under chloroform, if necessaiy. When consolidation of the contents of the sac Avas obtained, the compressing means might be removed. Such a method of treatment might possibly be advantageously combined in certain extreme and exceptional cases Avith the injection of the sac Avith the perchloride of iion, or the use of electro-puncture. _ The various methods of employing compression, viz., by clamps, by Aveight, by flexion, and by the finger, may often be advantageously combined in the sameGAL YANO-TUNCTURE. 63 case. When tlic patient tii-es of one, another may be substituted for it; and thus the good effects continuously kept up with less fatigue and imtation than would otherwise be experienced. So also various modifications of these different methods maybe practised to suit the requirements of any particular case. But for these no special directions can be given ; the ingenuity of the Sm’geonmust sunply the want in each case. _ Maxipulatio^\—Sir AY. Fergusson has proposed to treat some aneurisms by a procedure which he terms manij)uMion. This consists in squeezing the Imeiu-ismal tumour in such a way as to detach a portion of the coagiiliim ivitliin it which, being carried on with the emrent of blood into the distal end of the artery, obstructs this ; and thus, by impeding the circidation through the sac, may lead to the gradual consolidation of the tumour ; and it has also been suggested by Oliver Pemberton that the alteration of the relations of the laminated fibrine in the camty of the aneurism may bring about a further de- position of fibrine on the displaced laminm. This procedure has as yet been employed to too limited an extent to enable us to form au estimate of its value, and can scarcely be considered, nor is it intended to be, of veiy general appli- cation. To aneurisms, hoiveyer, that are not amenable to ordinaiy singical treatment, and that must necessarily prove fatal if left, as those situated at the root of the neck, more particularly of the subclavian artery, it might possibly be advantageously applied. It is scarcely necessary, however, to point out the pbvioiis danger of rupture of the sac, or of the diffusion of the aneurism from the weakening of its wmlls liy the separation of the coagiiliim, to make Singeons adopt due caution in carrying out this method of treat- ment. There is another danger also especially attendant on this procedure, when applied to aneurisms about the neck ; viz., that the detached coa- giilum may be carried by the circulation into the cerebral arteries, and by obstructing them occasion the same kind of cerebral disturbance that ocem’s when these vessels become occluded by fibrinous plugs—cmbola. That tills danger is a real and a great one, is evident from the fact that, in several cases in which manipulation of subclavian and carotid aneurisms has been tried, the patient has been suddenly seized vdth syncope and hemiplegia. Teale has successfully conjoined manipulation with compression in a case of popliteal mieiu’ism, in which the pressure on the artery was slow in consolidating the tumour ; the detachment of a portion of the coagiiliim almost at once led to the consolidation of the tumour. Somewhat analogous to this method is one recommended in 1842 by Blake, who proposed, by the introduction •of a cataract-needle into the sac, to detach some of the laminated fibrine, which might then be washed against, and occlude the aperture of exit. GALViix'o-Pira'CTUiiE.—The attempt to procure the consolidation of an aiiein’ismal sac liy the employment of electricity or galvanism is of conipara- tivcly recent date. It appears to hai’e been first practised by B. Phillips, about the year 1832. Little attention, however, was given to the mode of treatment until a lew years back, when it was revived by some of the French and Italian Surgeons, especially P^trequin, Burci, and Ciuisclli. The principle on which this operation is conducted consists in endeavoining to produce coagulation in the aneiirismal sac by decomposing the blood contained in it by means of theAXEUlilSM. galvanic ciUTont. When two iieoclles connected with the poles of a galvanic bat- tery fu'e Jiitroduced into a mass of fluid blood, a firm solid coagulum is rapidly formed round that connected with the positive pole, while at the same time a large, soft, spongy clot mixed with bubbles of gas is seen at the negative needle, and a dai-k, tar-like fluid also makes its appearance. If the needle used be made of steel or any other readily soluble metal, further changes occur at the positive pole due to the production of salts of iron with the ac?ds liberated from the blood. These changes are spoken of as secondary electrolysis. The clot formed by electrolysis is, therefore, not composed simply of the fibrine of the blood, but contains also a large proportion of albumen coagulated by the chemical action of the current, and must he looked upon as a foreign body around Avhich we hope ordinary coagulation will occur. The operation of galvano-puncture is best performed as follows. Two steel needles, weU. insulated with vulcanite or gum-elastic, are inserted into the sac of the aneurism and connected with the opposite poles of the battery. The needles should be about one inch apart, parallel to each other, and so inserted that no part of the uninsulated portion of the needle shall touch the sac. The best battery for the purpose is Foveau’s modification of Smee’s, of which from ten to twenty-five cells may be used for a time varying from twenty minutes to half an horn-, or more—according to the effect produced. If the tumour be sufficiently near the siu’face to be clearly observed, as has been the case in several of the aneurisms in which the treatment has been employed, it will be seen to become more tense and Jinn, and the expansile natime of the pulsation will become diminished as the operation progresses. Sometimes bubbles of gas escape by the side of the negative needle, and a little thick brown fluid oozes up. Occasionally the tumour has been found to swell and become resonant on percussion. lATien a distinct effect has been produced the needles may be 'withdrawn, and the small pimctm’es closed "with lint and collodion. The negative needle will be found imaltered, while the positive will be coiroded directly in proportion to the amount of electrolytic action that has taken place. In order to prevent this corrosion of the j)ositive needle, it has been suggested by Dr. John Duncan that platinum may be used instead of steel. There is no e'^ddence, however, to prove that the salts of iron produced give rise to any particular danger; in fact, it is probable they aid considerably in the fomation of the Juni coagnlimi surrounding the needle. The battery used in the operation is of considerable importance. It has been pointed out by Ciniselh, that a current of high tension and somewhat low intensity is less likely to cause the production ot undue heat dmdng the operation, and consequently less prone to lead to inflam- mation and suppuration of the sac. A battery, therefore, composed of a large- number of small elements is superior to one of a few large elements, and all the requisite conditions are found best to be fulfilled by Foveau’s modification of Smee’s. Some operators, and especially Bastian, have advocated the introduction of the positive pole only, the negative being attached to a sponge or metal plate laid on the skin near the aneurism. The only objection to this mode of treatment is the excessively small effect produced. The electrolytic action which takes place is directly in proportion to the intensity oJ the cm- rent; and by the introduction of a considerable mass of the tissues of the- patient in the circuit, the resistance is so greatly increased that electrolysis isGALVANO-PUNCTUliE. 65 reduced to a scarcely appreciable amount, the positive needle appearing almost unchanged after the operation. Others, again, have introduced the negative needle only, hut as the coagulum fonned at the negative pole is ^ soft and frothy, but little good can be expected from this mode of operating. Dr. Julius Althaus, irho has superintended the operation in five cases, is strongly of opinion that “ the most effective application of the emrent is that where both poles are inserted into the sac.” Ciniselli operated in this Avay, and Dis. Duncan and Fraser, to whom we are indebted for many important observations on galvano-puncture and for the inA'ention of reliable insulated needles, support the same view. The operation is accompanied by but little pain, and it is only occasionaUy that chlorofoini is needed. The effect of a single operation is seldom sufficient to cause any marked improvement in the condition of the patient, and it requires usually to be repeated several times. The clot formed as the result of galvano-puncture is somewhat soft and yielding, and unless supported by a moderately firm sac soon flattens out or chsappeai's, and the condition of the aneurism becomes much the same as it was before the operation. Little more than the most temporary relief can for this reason be expected in many cases; and whenever the aneurism has become diffused, the operation can only be productive of mischief by hastening the inflammatory changes occirn’ing round the sac. It might be supposed that so soft a clot woidd readily break up, and that the danger of embolism would be great in consequence ; but experience has shown it is not so, no such accident having happened in any of the recorded cases. Suppm’ation of the sac has occasionally ocemred, but its occurrence has been much less frequent since the principles of the operation have been more fully luiderstood. The formation of sloughs round the needle-punctures, and consequent hmmorrhage, has not been noticed except when the needles have been imperfectly insulated. In fact, it may be said that in almost every case, even when the operation has fixilcd to give relief, it has at any rate done no harm. The statistics of the operation have not been fully compiled, but the general results of the pubhshed cases have not been unfavourable when we consider the hopeless nature of the cases in Avhich it has been performed. Of 13 cases of aneurism of the aorta treated by Chiiselli’s method, five were cured, and no evil consequences followed in any case. Of the same number which have been operated on in this country during the last few years, none have been ciued, but at least six experienced more or less relief; and in almost all, it may be said, the operation only aimed at rehef, the disease being too advanced to waiTant any hope of cure. About sixty other cases of aneurism of "V arious arteries have been collected by Ciniselli as having been operated on before 18G8; but in these the methods used were so imperfect, that they cannot be fairly considered as bearing upon the question at the present time. '\\ffien we compare galvano-puncture with ligature or compression in the treatment of external aneurism, it is, I think, impossible to hesitate fora moment in giving a decided preference to the latter modes of treatment, as the results that have hitherto been obtained are not such as would justify a prudent Surgeon m submitting his patient to an operation of this kind, when he pos- sesses such certain and comparatively safe modes of treatment as deligation or VOL. II. ° F66 ANEURISM. compression. In internal aneurisms, or in tliose cases in -whicli the disease is so situated at the root of the neck, that the artery can neither be ligatured with safety nor compressed, galvano-puncture is certainly justifiable, especially when conjoined with proper medical treatment, as we have ample proof that ■with the knowledge and means now at our disposal we can perform the opera- tion wdth scarcely any danger to the patient, and in favourable cases Avith much hope of relief. Much will depend upon the selection of the case. Cini- selli has pointed out that the conditions favourable to success, are that the aneurism shall be sacculated and opening into the vessel by a narrow month, of slow growth and of medium size, and, when thoracic, situated entirely within the thorax, and that it shall not in any serious way have interfered with the general health of the patient. These conditions seldom occur ; and Avhen they are absent, the most that can he hoped for is temporary aiTest of the progress of the disease and some relief to the patient’s sufferings. Injection avith Perchloride of Iron.—The injection of aneurismal sacs with a solution of the perchloride of iron has also been practised, Avith the view of coagulating their contents ; such treatment, however, is attended Avith great risk of embolism, and is in every way vastly inferior to the ligature or com- pression of the artery leading to or beyond the sac, and should never he employed if these can be practised. Aneiu’ism of the gluteal artery has been successfully treated by injection of the perchloride of iron in at least one case. In cases, hoAvever, in which, either from the situation of the disease, its complication Avith other and exten- sive disease of the arterial system, or its multiple character, hgature and compression are not applicable, an endeavour might be made to procime the arrest of the blood in the tumour by distal compression of the artery, before attempting to coagulate its contents by injection of the perchloride ; and I cannot but think that a satisfactory result might thus be obtained. Hypodermic Injection of Ergotin.—Langenbeck adA^ocated the hy|io- dermic use of a watery extract of ergot in cases of aneurism, mider the impres- sion that it might act on the muscular fibres scattered over the sac of the anemism in the same way as it acts on the muscular fibres of the uterus, and by causing contraction might gTaduaUy diminish the size of the anem’ism, if not cure it. He seems to haA'e tided it in tAA'o cases only. One Avas an aneurism in the supraclavicular region (exact natm’e not mentioned), Avhich had been preAdously treated Avith moxas, and almost cimed. The symptoms having retunied, hypodermic injections of ergot were tried. The quantity injected varied from about J gi’ain to 3 gi'ains of Bonjean’s Avatery extract of ergot, diluted with three times as much spirit and glycerine. The injections Avere repeated every three or foim days. Decided improvement is said to have occurred, but pulsation never quite ceased. The improvement commenced after the second injection. No unpleasant symptoms occim-ed after the injec- tions. In the second case a man, aged 42, had a sacculated aneurism of the radial artery of the size of a hazel-nut. An injection of two grams and a half of the Avatery extract cured it in one day, as the next day it could not be felt. The injection gave rise to some inflammation of the siuTOunding cellular tissue, Avhich disappeared in a AA'eek.ARTERIO-VENOUS ANEURISM. 67 This accident I have seen happen in one case in which 1 tried it, ljut no good resulted from this treatment, which cannot, indeed, on pathological gi-ounds, be considered to bo of a hopeful character. Meciiaxical 3IEAXS of various kinds have been nsed with the view of producing an artificial coagulum in the aneurism, and thus leading to its cure. Thus coils of horse-hair, cat-gut, or iron-wire have been thrust into and left in the sac, tlu’ough a punctiu’c made in it. It is scarcely necessary to say that such means of cure are as useless as they are unscientific. ABTEBIO-VENOUS ANEUBISM. Pretcraatural commiuiication between arteries and veins, though usually the result of wounds, occasionally happens from disease ; ulceration taking place between the vessels, and thus causing an aperture to lead fr’om one into the other. When such communications are of a traumatic character, they may, as has ah-eady been stated, constitute either an Aneurismal Varix or a Varicose Aneurism. As the result of disease, aneiu’ismal varix only can occur, varicose aneurism never happening except as a consequence of wound. These spon- taneous communications have been met mth between the aorta and the vena cava, and between the iliac, femoral, carotid, and subclavian arteries and their accompanying veins. In nature, symptoms, com*se, and treatment, they so closely resemble traumatic anemismal varix, described at page 317, vol. I., that their consideration need not detain us here.SPECIAL ANEURISMS. 68 SPECIAL ANEUEISMS. CHAPTER XLIY. —♦— ANEURISMS OF THE THORAX, HEAD AND NECK, i\XD UPPER EXTREMITY. ANEUBISM OP THE THORACIC AORTA. Symptoms.—The symptoms of Intrathoracic Aortic Aneimism are of tMO kinds : cmseultalory and rational. The Auscultatory Signs vary greatly in distinctness, and even in pre- sence. In some cases, more especially in fusiform aneurisms, they are almost from the first of a very marked and obvious character ; in others, especially in sacculated aneiu'isms, they are absent throughout, the aneurism terminating- fatally without its existence ha'^dng been determined by the stethoscope. They consist in miumurs of various kinds and degrees of intensity, bellows, rasping, or whizzing ; in the second soimd of the heart being audible over a greater space than normal. At the same time there may be dulness on percussion. These various signs may often be heard more distmctly upon or to the left side of the spine, than at the anterior part of the chest; when occurring anteriorly, they are chiefly met with on the right side. The ■\’alue of the auscultatory signs in the diagnosis of anem-ism within the chest is not perhaps so gi'eat as in many other thoracic diseases, in the early stages of the affection, and in those cases in which the aneurism continues small and sacculated throughout, or is so deeply seated as not to approach the parietes of the chest. This need not be a matter of siuprise, when we reflect how deeply the ascending portion of the aorta and the arch are situated ; how they are covered in front by the hmgs and loose areolar tissue, through which sound is with difficulty transmitted ; and how they are covered in behind by the spine and its muscles. M^hen, in addition to this, it is borne in mind that aneiu'isms of the arch often prove fatal by bursting into contiguous carities and canals before they have attained a size gveater than that of a walnut or a pigeon’s egg, and thus are incapable of frunishing a miumiu of any veiy maiked kind, it can be easily understood that the value of auscultation is but small in many cases of thoracic aneurism. The Rational Signs of intrathoracic aortic aneurism are of three kinds : Prcssiue-Effects ; Pulsation ; and Tumour. Pressure-Effects may be exercised on any of the contiguous structures ; and a glance at the anatomical relations of the thoracic aorta, more particulailyrHESSUEE-EFFECTS OF ACUTE ANEUEISiV. 69 j the arch, will enable the Surgeon to judge of their complexity and importance, r They will ncccssm-ily vary according to the size of the aneimism and the portion J of the aorta affected by it; more according to the latter than to the former I condition. "When the aneurism arises from the root of tJie aorta, and more i especially when it is intrapcricardial, it is usually of small size, and its pres- • siu-e-cffects nill be little obvious. AVheu the aneurism arises from the termi- '1 nation of the arch, or the descendimj aorta, it may often attain a considerable I amount of develoiDment without any very obvious pressure-effects being induced. I Aneurisms that arc situated within the concavity of the arch necessarily give i rise to ^■ery severe effects, by the compression they must exercise upon some } one or other of the very important structures that are spanned by and included j within the aortic arch. When the anterior part of the aorta is affected, the aneurism may attain a 's'ery considerable bulk, even coming forward so as to project and pulsate between the intercostal spaces, Avithout any very noticeable pressiuc-effects being induced. But AAfren the posterior ivall of the artery is the seat of the disease, then severe symptoms are early set up by the compres- I sion and erosion of the structmes lying contiguous to the artery and along the Fig. .'5(2.—Erosion of Inten-erteliral aubstanco liy asinall Anem-ism of De- scending Aoi'ta pressing backwai’ds.

When the upper part of the aortic arch is the seat of aneu- rism, a peculiar train of cerebral symptoms, such as vertigo, insensibility, or e ec i\e Aision, may be induced by its interference Avith the circulation through the carotids. The pressm-e-effects that need chiefly engage our attention, are 1, Pain • Dyspnoea ; 3, Dysphagia ; and 4, (Edema.

The first kind is70 SPECIAL ANEUEISAIS. liincinatiug, intermittent, and neuralgic in its character, evidently dependent npon pressure on the spinal or sympathetic nerves. This pain is chiefly seated on the left side, and shoots up the side of the head and face, along the upper su’m to the elbow, along the intercosto-humeral nerve, through the chest, or between the scapulm. The second form of pain usually occurs at a later stage of the disease, is continuous, and of a boring, hot, or burning character. It seems to depend upon the perforation of the tissues, more especially the bones, by the aneurismal tumour, and chiefly occurs on the right side of the chest (Fig. 373). 2. Dyspnoea is of very frequent occim-ence in intrathoracic aneurism ; in all probability it is more uniformly met with than any other single symptom. It may arise from five distinct conditions, and its characters vary with its cause. a. From direct jwesslire on the trachea In these cases the dyspnena is attended by much and constant wheezing, cough, often by whisthng sounds in the chest and tubular respiration, and by slow expansion of that cavity. There is usually expectoration of thick tenacious or ropy mucus. j3. From direct pressure on a 'bronchus (Fig. 374). In these cases there are wheezing, cough, and some degree of expectoration, with perhaps diminished respiratory murmm’ in the side affected, and puerile respiration in the opposite lung, as has been pointed out by Stokes. y. From pressure upon the lung. In these cases the respiration is compara- tively little interfered with, the spongy tissue of the lung accommo- dating itself and yielding to the pres- sure of the tumour. After a time, the pulmonic tissue will become in- corporated Avith the wall of the sac ; and then more serious difficulty in breathing, with htemoptysis, Avill siqDervene. S. Dyspnoea may be, and very commonly is, induced by irritedion, comp-ession, flattening out, or stretching of the leftpneumogastric and recurrent largngeal nerves, by the pressme of the tumour. In these cases the larynx becomes the seat of the difficult res- piration, its muscles being driven into a state of spasm, so as to occa- sion paroxysmal attacks of intense difficulty of breathing. The voice becomes hoarse, croupy, or croaking; the cough has a loud croupy or metaUic sound, and is attended by the expectoration of thin fr'othy mucus.

Ihe laiyngeal symptoms are sometimes so much more prominent than any of the other signs of intrathoracic aneurism, and so closely resemble chronic or even acute laryngitis, with impending asphyxia, that there are not a few cases on record in which Surgeons have performed tracheotomy, on the supposition that they had to do with cases of pure and uncomplicated laryngeal disease ; and in other instanees this operation has been performed with the xdew of prolong- ing life, even Avhen the dependenee of the laryngeal spasm on anemism of the aorta has been recognised. Dr. George Johnson has made some important observations on the use of the laryngoscope in the diagnosis of the cause of dyspnoea in aortic aneurism. He says that, in eases where the cause is pressm-e on the reemrent laryngeal neive, the larynx is seen to be healthy, and the spasm may be seen to occur. If the pressure be sufficient to abolish the function of the nerve, unilateral paralysis will occur, which can easily be ascertained by laryngoscopic examina- tion. The voice in such cases is weak and husky ; whereas, in cases in which the pressure is on the trachea, its character is unchanged. When a thoracic anem-ism presses the trachea against the spine, the tracheal stridor and the voice-sound are heard with remarkable distinctness on applying the stetho- scope over the upper dorsal vertebrm—the sound being conducted through the bones. e. Dyspnoea may be dependent on the compression of the imlmonary vein by the aneiu’ismal tumom-. In cases of this kind there would be considerable li\*idity of surface, and signs of pulmonary congestion. The dyspnoea of intrathoracic aneurism will often be sufficiently intense to occasion death. It may be mistaken for ordinary asthma ; but the diagnosis can usually be effected, by observing that in aneurism the paroxysms of dyspnoea often come on in the day as well as at night, and are greatly increased by change of position, as by placing the patient either upright or recumbent, the tumour thus shifting its point of pressure. It is, as Bellingham has pointed out, not influenced by atmospheric changes, and is generally associated with laryngeal stridor or spasm. When such symptoms as these are associated with pain and dysphagia, they point very strongly, even in the absence of all auscnltatoiy signs, to the presence of an aneurismal tumour. Aneurisms situated within the concavity or springing from the posterior parts of the aortic arch are those which, either directly by their pressure on the air-tubes or the pulmonary veins, or indirectly by the influence they exercise on the recurrent laryngeal nerve, are chiefly associated with dyspnoea. 3. Dysphagia is a symptom of sufficiently frequent occurrence in aortic aneurisms. Eaton has determined its existence in nine out of twelve cases. It seldom occurs, however, in the earlier stages of the disease, or when the aneu- rism is small, and hence is of much less diagnostic value than dyspnoea. When, however, it is associated with that symptom, the combination becomes im- portant ; as the co-existence of the two conditions clearly points to the com- pression of the oesophagus and the air-tubes by a tumour, which other diagnostic signs may prove to be aneurismal. It is of importance to bear in mind that in some aneurisms, especially of theSPECIAL ANEURISMS. 72 descending thoracic aorta, dysphagia may be one of the most marked signs. In snch cases as these, stricture of the cesophagus has eiToncously been sup- posed to exist, and the patient has even been treated by the introduction of bougies on this supposition—an eiTorof practice that has terminated fatally by the perforation of the aneurismal sac, where it projected against the oesophagus, by the point of the instrument. The difficulty in deglutition in cases of compression of the oesophagus by aortic aneiu-ism, is almost invariably rcfeiTcd to the episternal notch. The dysphagia is cmmnonly associated with pain, or Avith the sensation of a cord draAvn tightly around the body. 4. (Edema, with more or less lividity of the upper extremities and head and neck, occasionally but rarely occiu-s. It is generally most marked on the left side, and arises from the compression of the superior cava or the inno- minate veins by aneimsms springing from the fore or upper part of the arch. Pulsation and Tumour, in intrathoracic aortic aneurism, so far as they are observable externally, are always absent in the early stages of the disease, and vei’y frequently continue so throughout the progness of the aflection ; indeed, in aneurisms sprmging from the intrapericardial aorta or the concavity of the arch, death usually takes place, either by ruptm’e into one of the serous cavities or the air-tube, or by the exhaustion induced by dyspnoea, long before the aneurism has attained a sufficient size to be recognisable externally. There are, however, three portions of the thoracic aorta which, when affected by anemism, yield external evidence by the existence of pulsation or tmnom' of the true nature of the disease. These are—1, the anterior aspect of the ascending aorta ; 2, the summit of the arch; and 3, the posterior aspect of the descending aorta. 1. When the anemism is situated in the anterior aspect of the ascending aorta and commencement of the arch, pulsation may be detected by pressm’e betAveen the intercostal spaces on the right side of the sternum, and a thrill, as weU as distinct impulse, may often be felt over that side of the chest, before any external tumour becomes visible ; thus simulating the beat of the heart, in addition and opposite to the seat of the true cardiac impulse. As the aneurism increases an external tumour appears, the Avail of the chest becoming absorbed and perforated opposite the point of greatest impulse. 2. When an anemism springs from the summit of the arch, a pulsating tumour appears at the root of the neck, behind or even above the margin of the sternum, most commonly towards the right side, and occasionally rises so high out of the thorax, and is so distinctly felt in the neck, as to rim the risk of being confomided with aneurism of the brachio-cephahe oi caiotid arteries (Fig. 379, p. 87). This error, which has frequently been committed, and Avhich has led to operations on the arteries at the root of the neck, may usually be avoided, except in the case of the brachio-cephahe, by the im- possibility of tracing with the finger the lower boundary of the timiom-, and the existence of distinct dulness on percussion, possibly of impulse or of auscultatory evidence of aneiuism, beloAV the level of the upper miugin of the sternum or clavicle. 3. When aneiuism springs fr-om t\\Qposterior tvatl of the descending aorta, a pulsating tumoiu may gTadually develop itself to one side ot the spine oiTREATMENT OF AORTIC ANEURISM. 73 mute tho scapnlu, commonly o.i the lelt side ; and it may attain an oxcos- sive development, fully as lar^e as tbo head, before the patient is destioyed by the ruptiu'c of the tumour externally. . . r. ,i .i • Siu-ical interference usually avails but little in anemisms of the thoracic aorta and in many cases it is more humane to allow the patient to die in peace than to tortm-e him by any experimental surgery, which may only tend to hasten the fatal termination of the case. The only treatment adapted to aU cases is constitutional, conducted on the principles laid down in pp. 33—35, and no operative procedm-e is justifiable before this has had a fair trial. Cases do, however, arise in which relief at least may be hoped for as the result of operative interference. The interesting pathological observation having been made by Dr. Coclde, that if the left carotid artery became occluded, there was a tendency to spontaneous cime in an aortic aneiu’ism^ situated at its cardiac side, it was determined to make a direct application of this observation to practice by tying the left common carotid in aneurisms of the first and second parts of the aortic arch. Accordingly in 1872 Chris- topher Heath ligatined the left carotid with much benefit to the patient in a case of anem'ism of the ascending and transverse aorta under the care of Di. Cockle. Other Siu’geons have tried to obtain consolidation of the tumour by endea- vom’ing to coagidate its contents by thrusting coils of iron-wire or cat-gut into its interior, but it need scarcely be said that in no case has any permanent success attended such operations. The mode of treatment which has been more frequently adopted than any other is galvano-puncture ; and it seems probable that in well-selected cases this may be productive of considerable good, or even occasionally lead to a complete cure. In 27 cases of aortic aneinism thus treated, Avhich have been collected by John Duncan, 5 were cured, 10 relieved, 9 unrelieved, and 3 died. Experience has shown that with the latest improvements in the operation— well insulated needles and a suitable battery—there is scarcely any danger to life, and that even where it does no good it does no harm. It has been applied in all stages of the disease, from the time when the tumour becomes sufficiently superficial to allow the safe introduction of the needles, to the time when it has perforated the chest-waU, and is on the point of binsting. In one of John Dmican’s cases, the life of the patient was undoubtedly prolonged for nearly three months after the time at which, if left to itself, the aneurism would have burst externally. The cases best suited for galvano-pimctme, and in which even a cure may be occasionally hoped for, are those in which the tumour is of slow growth, has not yet perforated the chest-wall, and in which it can be diagnosed as sacculated and communicating with the aorta by a comparatively small opening. It is important also that the patient’s health should not be too much broken by suffering or visceral disease. "When the tumour projects through the parietes of the thorax, forming a secondary sac outside, the pros- pect of cure is infinitesimally small; but even then, progress may be delayed, and much relief given to the patient. If the tumoiu- have become diffused, as may occiu when it points at the back, galvano-puncture can only do harm by increasing the tendency to inflammation and suppuration already existing. For the details of the operation, see page 04.74 SPECIAL ANEURISMS. I here is one point in the treatment of some forms of aortic aneurism, tliat^ falls moi’e within the province of the Surgeon, and on which his opinion may be sought. I mean the advisalhlity of opening the windpipe, to relieve the patient from the distress oceasioned by the laryngeal spasm that commonly attends many of these cases. The decision of this question is ahvays an anxious one; for it must be borne in mind that, as the disease that occasions the spasm of the larynx is necessarily and inevitably fatal, the operation can only be expected to give temporary relief, and perhaps but a brief prolongation of life. In determining this question, the Surgeon must boar in mind that simple laiyngcal spasm is rarely, if ever, the cause of death in aortic aneurism ; that, although the patient may suffer greatly from this complication, he does not die of it; but that the ultimate cause of death is usually intrathoracic pressure, rupture of the sac internally or externally, or exhaustion. The operation, therefore, would be justifiable in those cases only in which it could be deter- mined that the spasmodic dyspnoea was purely laryngeal, and was not depen- dent on compression of the air-passages within the chest by the aneurismal tumour, but simply on the irritation produced by the implication of the left recmTent laryngeal nerve. Such cases are very rare pathologically, and necessarily most difiicult of acciuate diagnosis. As the Surgeon wiU usually get the credit of having killed the patient if he be induced to perform the operation, and the relief be not immediate and great, I would advise him not to operate unless the diagnosis be most clear, or in circumstances of im- minent death from laryngeal spasm, with the view of affording immediate, even if it be temporary, relief. If any operation be done, it should certainly be laryngotomy, and not tracheotomy. ANEUHISM OP THE INNOMINATE ARTERY. Aneurisms of this artery may be either of the tubular or the sacculated kind, and usually give rise to a train of serious and dangerous symptoms, fr’om their pressure upon important parts in their neighbourhood. Indeed, a glance at the relations of this artery wiU show the important effects that must be pro- duced by the pressure of a tumour spi'inging fr’om it. Before it lies the left innominate vein; to the outer side or behind, the superficial cardiac nerve ; to its left is found the trachea, and more posteriorly the msophagus ; on its right are the innominate vein of that side, and the summit of the costal pleura ; externally and posteriorly it is in relation with the pneumogastric, and more posteriorly and internally it lies below the right recurrent laryngeal ncr\ e. SyjMPTOMS.—The general symptoms of an aneiuism of this ai'tery are the existence of a pulsating tumour of a globular shape behind the right sterno- clavicular articulation, attended with pain, and perhaps oedema of the light side of the face and arm, ivith some difficulty in respiration, laryiigeal cough, and dysphagia. The tumour is usually soft and compressible, filling up more or less completely the hollow above the sternum, and even rising as high in the neck as the lower margin of the cricoid cartilage ; it pushes foiuaids, fiist the sternal, and afterwards the clavicular portion of the stemo-mastoid muscle, and has occasionally been seen to extend into the posterior inferioi triangle of the neck ; and, indeed, is generally most distinctly defined towards its brachiaFliESSUIxE-EFFECTS OF INNOMINATE ANEUEISM. 75 aspect In some eases no tnmonr rises into the neck, but the sterniun, clavicle, and costal cartilage of the first rib, arc found to be considcralfiy imshcd forwards beyond their natural level. In the space around the light sterno-ehn-icular articulation, and about the upper part of the sternum, there will be dulness on percussion. In very many instances there is no bruit, but merely a strong impulse with the heart’s sounds, as distinct as in the cardiac region, or even more so ; but in other cases there is eveiy variety of bruit. Ipressure-Effects.—The most important symptoms arc occasioned perhaps by the pressure-effects of the tumour upon the neighbouring parts, affecting the pulse, the venous circulation, the neiwes, respiration, and degliititioii. The Pulse is usually influenced, being much smaller and feebler in the radial arteiy of the affected than of the sound side, and in some instances being completely arrested ; owing, doubtless, to the occlusion of the subclavian. The pulsation in the right carotid and its branches is also frequently much less powerful than in the opposite vessel. These signs commonly occur before any external tumour is seen or can be felt, and hence constitute an important element in the early diagnosis of the disease. Enlargement of the Superficial Veins of the neck and right upper extremity is of frequent occurrence, the external jugular being the vessel that is usually flrst dilated ; at a more advanced period the superficial subcutaneous veins of the upper part of the right side of the chest often become tortuous and form a dense plexus in this situation, while many anastomose with the cephahe and thoracic veins above, and the superficial epigastric below. As the pressure increases, oedema commences in the right eyelids and hand, and may speedily extend to the whole of the head, face, and arm, which become hard and brawny in consequence of serous infiltration. In one instance I have seen the left arm become suddenly oedematous, the left imiominate vein being pressed upon. In these cases the eyes become staring and prominent, and the lips, nose, and features livid and turgid with blood, as well as oedema- tous, so as to greatly alter the expression of the countenance. Pain of a dull aching character is experienced in the situation of the tumour, from the compression of the neighbouring structures. But, early in the disease, and among some of the first symptoms, the patient often exjDeri- ences sharp shooting pains, apparently of a rheumatic or neuralgic character, in the arm and the side of the head and face, arising fr’om pressure upon, and in’itation of, nerves of the cervical and brachial plexuses. Taking the course of the ascending and descending filaments of the cervical plexus, the pain shoots up the side of the head and neck, over the shoulder apd upper part of the chest; or, from pressure upon the brachial plexus, it radiates down the hand and arm, being usually especially severe about the elbow and fingers. The muscular power of the right arm also commonly becomes impaired. Dyspnoea is of very common occurrence, and of very varying degrees of intensity, from slight difficulty in breathing up to frital asphyxia. It may proceed cither from irntation of the larynx, in consequence of compression of the rccuiTent nerve ; or fr’om pressure on the trachea. When it depends on larjTigeal iiritatioii, the voice is hoarse, husky, or whispering ; and there is a dry, croupy, and paroxysmal cough, usually accompanied by expectoration of t in frothy mucus. In these cases, after death, the recuiTent nerve wilt be76 SPECIAL ANEURISMS.

T 1 trachea, which becomes flattened and emwed dvsnnmn oi f '' / Protrusion of the tumour, is a common cause of ayspnaa, and is not unti-equently associated with the laryngeal irritation. More rarely by far, the right bronchus is compressed by the extension of the tumoim dowmvards. Dysphagia is of sufficiently fre- quent occuiTence, and varies from slight uneasiness in deglutition to an impos- sibility of swallouang anything except fluids. I have never seen it occiu- with- out having been preceded by dyspnoea; and, in every instance that has fallen under my observation, it has been associated with laryngeal initation. The coincidence of these two symptoms is readily explained by the anatomy of the parts; the recun-ent nerve, lying between the sac and oesophagus, must suffer compression before the mucous canal be interfered with. Prognosis.—The prognosis of bra- chio-cephalic anem’ism is in the highest degree unfavoiu’able, though the disease fr’equently does not run a rapid course. If it extend upwards and outwards, the tumoiu- may acquire a very large size before any very important organ or part is implicated ; but if it press back- wards and inwards, it may prove fatal at any early period. I know of no case in which such an aneurism, if left to itself, has midergone spontaneous cure, and but few instances in which the ruptiu-e of the sac has taken place. The most fr-equent cause of death is asphyxia, from spasmodic closm-e of the larynx induced by irritation of the recurrent nerve ; or fr-om pressm-e on the trachea. Diagnosis.—The diagnosis of iimominate aneurism is usually suffieiently easy, if attention be paid to the symptoms that have just been detailed. But at times the difficulty is unavoidably so great as to baffle the most sagacious Physicians and most experienced Surgeons ; that which has during life been considered to be •an aneurism of the innominate artery, having, after death, proved to be one of the summit of the aortic arch rising up into the root of the neck behind the right sterno-mastoid, or overlapping the braehio- cephalic trunk. The task of overeoming this difficulty in diagnosis must be left to the tact of the Surgeon. But it is impossible to over-estimate its importance, when the question of ligatiu’ing the arteries at the root of the neck for a supposed innominate anem'ism is contemplated; for, in at least three out of the nine cases in which this operation has been done, the arch of the aorta has been foimd to be the seat of disease ; in two of the cases the innominate being unaffected by aneurism. And I am acquainted with a fourth case, in Avhich the oiicration was commenced, but was abandoned, as2'liEAT}fENT OF lENOMINATE AA EUlilS^f. 77 the subclavian could not be reached ; the patient dying a few days afterwards, the aneurism Avas found to ho aortic, rising up into the root of the neck, the imiominate being sound. . , . , i Treat.aiext.—There are several instances on record in Avhich a properly conducted course of constitutional treatment has cured the patient: thus a case of Luke’s Avas permanently cured by small and repeated bleedings, conjoined Avith the administration of digitalis. In connection Avuth such ti'eatment, distal pressure might be employed, as in a case that deriAcd benefit from this plan in Syme’s hands. In aneurism of the innominate, the vessel is so short, and the sac so situated,, that it is impossible to attempt to apply a ligatiu’e on the cardiac side of the tumour. What resource, then, docs surgery ofFer in these cases beyond the employment of constitutional and dietetic means ? It may be ansAvered te this, that, if these measures fail in arresting the disease, oiu’ choice must lie betAveen two alternatives ; leaving the patient to his fate, or having recourse to the appheation of the ligature on the distal side of the tumour. On looking on the innominate artery with reference to the distal ojieration, we are struck by two peculiarities in the vessel, which must necessarily modify to a considerable extent not only the seat of the operation, but the j)rinciple on Avhich it is conducted. The fii’st pecuharity to which I allude is the shortness of the trunk, which makes it imj)ossible to apply the ligature to the vessel itself, but renders it necessary to deligate one or both of its terminal branches. The other peculiarity is, that in no circumstances can these vessels be so ligatiued as to arrest the whole of the blood sent into the artery ; for, although the circulation through the carotid may be entirely stopped, yet it is impossible, from the seat and extent of the disease, to tie the sub- clavian at any point except beyond the scaleni ; hence that blood which is destined for the supply of the branches of this vessel—the vertebrals, the thyi’oid axis, the internal mammary, and the first intercostal—must continue to be propelled into and through the sac. Three distinct modifications of the distal operation have been proposed and resorted to for the cure of aneurisms in this situation: 1. Ligature of the SubclaAdan alone; 2. Liga- tiue of the Carotid alone ; and 3. Ligature of Both Vessels with an interval of greater or less extent. 1. Ligature of the Suhcla-vian only (Fig. 37G, p. 80) has been prac- tised in four cases, the results of Avhich are exhibited in the folloAvins,’ Table • two were soon fatal, and the partial success in one of the other cases may be fairly attributed in a great measure to the accident of the carotid haAung been occluded. The results of this practice haA’C certainly not been sufficiently favoiuable to justify the Surgeon in repeating an attempt of this kind, opposed as it is to the known principles on Avhich the distal operation effects a cure. For, supposing, as we may safely do, with Wardrop, that only one-third of the blood that is sent into the innominate finds its Avay through the extrascalenal portion of the subclavian, the remainder being destined for its branches and the carotid in crpial proportions, Avhat fact can be adduced or principle laid dowm from Avhich we can expect to obtain the cure of an aneurism in close proximity to the heart, by cutting off so small a proportion as one-third of the supply of the blood sent into it ?SPECIAL ANEURISMS. 7S AXKURISMS of IJTXOJrOATE TREATED BY LIGATURE OF SUBCLAVIAX OXLY. nEMAIlKS.

Knowles records a case which terminated fatally from apoplexy, and O’Shaughnessey one in which galvano-piinctnre was unsuccessfully applied after the operation had failed to give relief. A fatal case is also attributed to Ordile (1859 ? ) but no particulars can be ascertained. Porta once perfoniied the operation, but after the death of the patient no aneurism was found. Holmes, after carefully investigating the ertdeiice, is of opinion that the eases in the above table attributed to Rompani and 'Vilardebo are in reality only one case. In 1852? Pirogoff ligatured the left carotid in a case of aneuiism of the aorta and innominate. The jiatient died hemiplegic. In 1873 Heath ligatured the left carotid in a case of innominate aneurism. Tlie patient died almost immediately apparently from want of supply of blood to the brain. The right vertebral was obliterated, and the sac of the anem’ism projected behind the right carotid, so as to interfere considerably with the flow of blood through it. 3.

Died on eighth day of “ shock.” It was attempted in 1868 by Chevers, but the subclavian vein was woimded and the patient died in two hom’s ; and in another case Hodges performed the operation, but after death on the eleventh day no aneurism was found. A resume of the cases of anemdsm of the innominate, in which the operation of hgatm’ing one or both arteries beyond the sac has been performed, haidng thus been given, the question arises whether these operations, or any of them, should retain a place in surgery. This question may be examined in two points of view ; 1. As to the principle on which these operations are perfoi’med ; and 2, As to then’ results in practice. For the success of the distal operation, it is requisite that there be no branch given off, either from the sac or between it and the ligature; or that the ciuTent of blood through the sac be at least so far diminished as to admit of the deposition of laminated fibrine in sufficient quan- tity to fill it up, by a process similar to that which happens in a case of aneinism treated by the Hunterian method. In order that this may be accomplished, it is certainly necessary that the greater portion of the blood passing through the sac be arrested ; for, if the cun-ent that is still kept up be too free, the tumour will continue to increase, as we have seen happen in cases of inguinal aneurism in which the femoral artery has been ligatured below the epigastric and the circumflex ilii, the cun’cnt thi’ough which has been sufficient to feed the sac in such a way that a ciu’e could not be accomplished. H, therefore, but one of the vessels leading from the brachio-cephalic, as the subclavian beyond thetreatment of innominate aneurism. 83 scaleni, be tied, and but a third of the blood circulating through the main nrterv be aiTCStcd, arc we justified in hoping that the circulation through the sac ^ill be so influenced by the deprivation of this small cpiantity, that the remaiuino- two-thirds of the blood, which wiU still pass thi-ough for the supply of the carotid and the branches of the subclavian, will gradually deposit those fibrinous laminie by which obliteration of the tumour is to bo effected ? Should v-e not rather expect that the larger current will be too powerful to allow the formation of these layers, and will continue to distend the sac in such a way as to prevent its contraction ? Sm-ely, if the comparatively small and feeble streams of blood, that pass through the epigastric and circumflex ilii, are suffi- cient to interfere with the cure of an inguinal aneurism after the distal ligatiue of the femoral, the strong current that sweeps through the carotid and the large branches springing from the subclavian, mth the full force derived from close proximity to the heart, will most probably be sufficient to prevent all lamination in an aneurism of the innominate. That the arrest of the circulation through one of these vessels only is not sufficient to influence materially the growth of the aneiu'ism, is evident likewise from what is not unfrequently observed after death in cases of this kind—one or other of the vessels being found compressed und obliterated by the pressure of the sac, or plugged by fibrine, and yet no alteration in the tmnour resulting. These cases, which are tolerably numerous, would of themselves have been sufficient to prove that something more than this amount of obstruction is required, in order to effect proper stratification of fibrine in the sac; and if we turn to the result of the twenty-eight cases in which either the carotid or the subclavian has been ligatured, we shall find that in one case only, that operated on by Evans of Belper, has a ciue been efiected; and in this instance how was it accomplished ? According to the principle on which it was attempted to be established ? Certainly mot; but, as will be seen by attention to the details of the case, and as has -aheady been pointed out vuth much acuteness by Gruthrie, by the accidental setting up in the artery of inflammation, Avhich extended to the sac, and thus obliterated it. In the case (that of Mrs. Denmark) in which Wardrop tied the subclavian for the eure of aneurism of the brachio-cephalic, there is some -reason to doubt whether the aivest of the progress of the tumour was owing to the hgatiue of the subclavian artery, or w'hether it Avas not much influenced by the obstruc- tion Avhich existed in the carotid for nine days after the operation, dming Avhich time so abundant a deposit of laminated fibrine might have occurred as to arrest the progress of the disease for some length of time. In this case, also, Cuthrie supposes it probable that the inflammation of the tumour might have led to its obliteration. From a careful consideration of all the circumstances of the cases in AA-hich ligature of one vessel only, either subclavian or carotid, has been employed for brachio-cephalic aneurism, Ave are, I tliink, fully justified in concluding that in sixteen of the cases the fatal result Avas accelerated, occurring as a consequence of the ligature of the vessel ; in three the progress of the disease Avas not materially interfered Avith ; in tAA’O it AAns arrested, the patients liAung for twenty mortths and two years respectively; and in one case only the disease was cured. The improvement in two of the cases Avas the result of accidental cir-SPECIAL ANEUPISMS. 84 ciimstances, wliich Averc unexpected, and unconnected in any Avay Avith tlic principles on AA'liich tlie operation Avas undertaken. These results Avould not, in my opinion, justify any Surgeon in again making an attempt to cure an in- nominate aneurism by the ligature of cither the subela\'ian or the carotid artery alone, the patient having been directly killed by tire operation in tAVO-thirds of the cases. Of the remaining third, in one-half the patients recovered from the operation, but the disease ran its course as if no such procedure had beeit adopted ; and in the remaining slender percentage of cases the improvement that took place in tA\'o, and the cure in the one solitary instance, Avere due to accidental circumstances unconnected Avith the operation, and Avhich con- sequently might have developed themselves equally if none had been perfonned. We have yet to consider the operation in AA'hich both arteries are ligatimed. This double operation may either be performed Avith an interval between the application of the tAvo ligatures, sufficient for the establishment of collateral circulation ; or the tAvo vessels may be ligatured simultaneously. The former plan has been adopted in four cases; the latter in eleven ; not a sufficient number for any safe deduction. In one of the foiu cases in which an interval intervened between the tAvo operations (Team’s), the tiunoiu’ seems to have undergone a ciue, being filled AAdth dense laminated fibrine: but the patient died eventnally of pleiuisy. In another case (Wickham’s) no good results followed the operation, death occiuring from bursting of the tumour. The third case (Malgaigne’s) died from the second operation. The fourth case (Bickersteth’s) also died. In the eleven cases in which both vessels AA^ere liga- tiued simultaneously, death occurred in one instance in consequence of the left carotid and right vertebral being accideirtally occluded, and the cerebral circula- tion being then solely dependent on the left vertebral; in another (Hutchison’s), ^ fr’om compression of the trachea and consequent suffocation; and in a third, from i the aorta being diseased and plugged Avith clot. In two cases only (Heath’s and ; Ensor’s) was the operation foUoAved by marked improvement, though not by Clue of the aneurism, which in Heath’s case proved to be aortic. In Hutchison’s case there is reason to belicA'e that the carotid only was tied, the ligature having been applied to the sheath of the subclavian instead of to that vessel itself, AA'hich, after death on the forty-fii’st day, was found plugged by old coagidum, but with- out any sign of having been tied. In five of the remaining six, the patients died. As I have just said, these cases are not sufficiently numerous or free from modifying circumstances to enable us to draw any definite inference from them : we must therefore revert to the prmciple on AA'hich this operation should be undertaken. This Avill differ materially, according to whether the two arteries are ligatiued simultaneously, or Avith a sufficient interval for the re-establishment of collateral circulation. If an intei’A'al of tAvo years, as in the fii’st case, or even of two-and-a-half months, as in the second instance, be alloAved to elapse betAveen the ligatiue ot the carotid and that of the subclavian, the operation reduces itself essentially to that of the ligatiue of a single artery, AA'hich, as has afready been shoAAii, is insufficient to induce those changes in the sac that are necessary for the accom- plishment of a cure. If the patient surviA'e the effect of the ligature of the carotid for a feAv Aveeks, sufficient time Avill haA'e been aftbrded for the proximal end of the subclaA'ian, the A'ertebral artery, and the thyroid axisTREATMENT OF INNOMINATE ANEURISM. 85 to take upon themselves a great increase of development the collateral circulation being carried on by them and not by the left carotid ; so that, by the time that the subclavian comes to be ligatimed beyond the scaleni, the sac wnll still continue to bo traversed by a ciu-rent of blood for the supply of the branches of the subcla-s’ian, dilated beyond their normal size, in consequence of the task of supplying the right side of the neck, face, head, and brain being principally thrown upon them. This current througli the proximal end of the snbcla^dan, increased as it will have been by the Avhole of that blood which is destined to supply the place of that which should pass by the cai-otid, will place the sac in nearly the same condition as it was before the ligature ; and will consequently, for the reason that has ali-eady been given, be too powerful for a cure to take place in the course of its stream. It now remains for us only to consider the simulianeous ligatm’e of both vessels—an operation that has been performed eleven times. In reasoning upon the simultaneous ligature of the two vessels, we must consider two points : 1. In what condition do we place the sac ? 2. Is the danger of the patient mqch increased ? So far as the sac is concerned, it is impossible to place it in a better condition for the deposit of fibrinous matter ; two-thirds of the blood flowmg tlu’ough it being an-ested, and that only traversing it which is destined for the supply of the branches of the subclavian. It is by no means improbable that even this stream may yet be too largo and forcible to allow the process of occlusion to take place, yet it is impossible stiU further to diminish it ; and if the anemism be sacculated, and project from one side of the innominate artery, particularly to its internal or mesial aspect, it is by no means impossible that it may be sufficiently removed from the stream to allow consohdation of its contents. Does it add to the danger of the patient to ligatm-e these two vessels simultaneously rather than separately ? I think not. If the risk of a double operation is to be incurred, 1 cannot think that it would be positively increased by the two being performed at once, instead of at separate intervals ; the whole of the vessels that serve to maintain the collateral circulation in the head and upper extremity—the vertebral, inferior thyroid, suprascapular, posterior scapular, and cervical—being left without interference. And the result that has followed the limited number of these oj)erations corroborates the justice of this opinion, for we find that the patients recovered from the operations in seven out of the eleven cases. But the result of these seven cases, so far as the aneurism itself was concerned, was by no means satisfactory. In Heath’s case, although the patient survived the operations for four years, yet the disease proved at the post mortem examination to have been an aneurism of the arch of the aorta, and not of the innominate ; Ensor’s case is still incomplete, the operation having been performed late in 1874 ; whilst the report in Sands’ case, within six months after the operation, shows that the aneurism was then not closed, although smaller and less active. In Hutchison’s case, the aneurism involved all the neigh- boimug arteries. In Maiuider’s, it appeal’s to have been aortic as -well as brachio-cephalic; and in Lane’s and Holmes’ cases no benefit appeal’s to beSPECIAL ANEURISMS. 86 attributable to the operation. So fixr, then, as aetual results go, it is evident that but A'ery little, if any, benefit has been derived from this operation in the gTeat majority of the cases in -which it has been done. The patients Avould probably have had an equally good, if not a better, prospect of life, if treated by palliative and constitutional means ; for it must not bo forgotten that patients -with aneurism of the innominate have been cured by such means, -which cannot be said of the operation. Added to all these considerations, there is extreme difficulty in the diagnosis, not only of the exact extent of an inno- minate aneurism, -ndiether it implicate the aortic arch or not, but whether it be an aneurism of the arch or of the brachio-cephalic. And I confess that I do not think that, however strong a iniori reasoning may be in favour of this operation, the results hitherto obtained have been such as to encoiuage a repetition of it. ANEURISM OF THE CAROTID ARTERY. Aneurismal Varix of the Carotid Artery and of the Jugular Vein, as the result of punctiues and stabs in the neck, has been met -with in a sufficient number of instances to establish the signs and treatment of such a condition ; and an instance is related by Mackmurdo, in which a communication was established between these vessels as the result of disease ; but I am not acquainted -with any case of Varicose Aneurism of these vessels having been recorded. The Signs of aneurismal varix in this situation present nothing pecidiar ; and the Treatment must be entirely of a hygienic character, no operative interference being likely to be attended by any but a fatal result. It is the more desirable not to interfere in these cases, as the disease docs not appear to shorten life. Spontaneous Aneurism of the Carotid is not of very unfrequent occiu- rence : in Crisp’s table of 551 aneiuisms, 25 were of the carotid ; and it ranks in oi’der of frequency between those of the abdominal aorta and of the sub- clavian. It occurs more frequently in the female than any other external aneiu’ism ; thus, of the 25 cases alluded to, 12 were in women, owing probably to its seldom being the result of violence, but generally arising from disease of the coats of the vessel. In Holmes’ table of 337 aneurisms, 11 were of the common carotid, 10 being spontaneous, and 1 traumatic. Three of the foimer were in women. This aneiuism is also remarkable as occurring at earlier ages than most others : thus, Hodgson has seen it in a gui of ten ; and Sykes, of Philadelphia, in one of eighteen. The right carotid is much more commonly affected than the left, and the upper portion of the vessel than the lo-v\er ; indeed, the bifui’cation is the most common seat of aneurismal dilatation. The root of the right carotid not uncommonly is dilated ; but I have ne^s er seen oi heard of a case in which the left carotid, before emerging fi'om the chest, has been affected. Symptoms.—A carotid aneurism in the early stage presents itself as a small, ormid, smooth tumour, with distinet pulsation and bruit, and a veU-ciicrmr- scribed outline. It is commonly soft and compressible, diminishing in size on irressiu’e, and expanding again with the usual aneurismal dilatation. As it increases iir size, it becomes more solid, occasions shooting pains in tic ea and neck, and, by its pressirre on the pharynx, ocsophagrrs, and larynx, pro rices87 DIAG^^OSIS OF CAROTID AFEURIS2I. difficulty in deglutition and respiration : souictiuics the salivary glands are much irritated. After a time, the cerebral circulation becomes interfered with, giving rise to giddiness, impaired vision of the coiTesj)onding eye, noises in the car, and a tendency to stupor. These symptoms may each be owing to com- pression of the jugular, or to difficulty in the transmission of the blood through the timaour. The size that these aneurisms may attain varies greatly : usually they ai-e confined to the space under the angle of the jaw, but not unfrequently they may occupy the greater part of the side of the neck. If they be allowed to increase without interference, death may happen, either by ruptm*e exter- nally, or into the pharynx or oesophagus; by asphyxia, from pressure on the larynx or recuiTent nerve ; or by starvation from compression of the oesophagus. Aneiu’isms of the carotid are usually of slow growth, and may sometimes exist for a considerable niunber of years without giving rise to any special inconvenience : this is more particularly the case when they are seated at the bifm’cation of the artery; when at the root, they are more likely to be attended by injiuious pressime-effects. Diagnosis.—The diagnosis of carotid anemism is without doubt more diffi- cult than that of any other form of external aneurism : the best proof that it is so, may be found in the fact that, of the cases in which the carotid artery has been ligatured for suj)posed aneurism of it or its branches, in several instances no such disease existed—solid cysts, or other tumours of the neck having been mis- taken for aneurism, and this by Siu’geons of great and acknowledged repute. The diagnosis of aneiu’ism of the lower part of the carotid from similar disease of other arteiies at the root of the neck, as of the sub- clavian, vertebral, and brachio-cephalic, and the arch of the aorta, is surrounded by difficulties, which can only be cleared up by a careful stethoscopic examination of the part. In some aneurisms of the arch of the aorta, the sac rises up into the neck, so as closely to simulate a carotid aneurism, as in the annexed cut (Fig. o70) ; and this greatly increases the difficulty of the diagnosis. In such cases. Holmes suggests that the effect produced by carefully applied distal'pressure may aid in the diagnosis. If, after a few hours, when the collateral circula- tioii shoiJd be commencing to enlarge, the sac shows no signs of flimini.bM tcmion, the case is very probably one of aortic aneurism. The principal affections of he neck, however, with which aneurism of the caro«rmaT be confomded, are varix of the internal jugidar vein, enlai’ged lymphatic A dilated arter;/ doubled upon itself may closely resemble an aneurism when situated at the root of the neck. Such a case is recorded by Co Zn I occurred m an old woman of 88. No tiPatment was adopted, Ld atr doath88 SPECIAL ANEURISMS. the supposed aneurism was found to be a I’eduplieation of the common carotid sinrounded by indurated cellular tissue. From varix the diagnosis may readily he made by attention to the follow'ng circnmstances : that in varix the tumour is always soft, does not pulsate ex- pansively, and diminishes in size dining a deep inspiration, and on compressing the vein on its distal side. Gkmdular tmnours of the neck are often very difficult to distinguish from aneinism, more particularly when the artery passes through and is embraced by the tumour, so that the whole mass distinctly moves at each pulsation. In these cases also there may be an apparent diminution in the size of the tumour on compression, by the artery mthin it being emptied, or by the growth reced- ing into some of the areolar interspaces of the neck. But in the great majority of instances, attention to the globular, oval, and nodulated feel of grandular swellings, the possibility of raising them up and pushing them away fr-om the vessel, which may best be done by feeling the carotid ivith the ends of the fingers of one hand, and then pressing upon the tumour with the other, ■will clear up the true nature of the case. From abscess of the neck the diagnosis must be made on general principles. The coexistence of ill-defined hardness and of enlargement of the glands, of an inflamed state of the skin, the ready detection of fluctuation, and the absence of expansive pulsation in the tumoui-, will show that it is not aneuiismal, however similar its other characters may be. It is also of import- ance to observe that an aneiu’ism that fluctuates is always forcibly distended ■with strong pulsation, and can be materially diminished by pressme, neither of which circumstances can possibly occur in abscess. But if abscess may be mistaken for aneimsm, the converse also holds good ; and an aneimsni may, unless care be taken, be mistaken for abscess—a far more fatal error. And there is one variety of false aneurism, that to which Liston has invited special attention, against which the Sui'geon must be carefully on his guard, on account of the many points of resemblance between it and aneurism : I mean the case in which an artery has given way into the sac of an abscess. In this case, fluctuation and pulsation will exist, although not perhaps of a distending kind. An important diagnostic mark will be, however, that the outhne of an anem’ism is distinctly defined and limited, while that of an abscess never is. Aneurism of the internal carotid has been found by Syme to simulate very closely abscess of the tonsils. Tumours of various kinds—carcinomatous, fatty, and fibrous—may occur in the neck, and cause some little embarrassment in the diagnosis fr'om aneuiism; thus Lisfr-anc, O’Reilly, and Ken* of Aberdeen have recorded cases in which the artery has been ligatured in such cases by mistake for aneurism. The diaonosis of such tmnoiu-s as these must be effected on ordinary principles. I have in several instances met with a small, hai-d, distinctly circumscribed tumoiu-, lying directly upon the carotid artery, and apparently connected with it and receiving pulsation fr’om it, usually produced ^ by a fit of coughing oi lauo-hing. This tumour, with the true nature of which I am unacquainted, remains stationary, and does not require any operative interference. The thyroid body is not unfrcquently the seat of enlargements, that may be and have been mistaken for aneurism. These consist chiefly in aTREATMENT OF CAROTID ANEURISM. S9 circumscribed enlari?cmcnfc of one lobe of the gland, whidi extends laterally over the common carotid, and receives pulsation from it. This kind of bron- chocclc may be diagnosed from aneurism by the communicated pulsation in it ceasing when it is raised from the artery. The most puzzling cases, hoiYCver, and those in which mistakes may most easily be made, arc instances oi •Tidsating hronchoceJc, in which these tumours have an acti\e and independent pulsation or thrill. In these instances, however, there arc thi-ee points that will almost invariably enable the Surgeon to effect the diagnosis. Thus the tumour, although principally confined to one lateral lobe, always affects the isthmus more or less. Then again, in bronchocele, that portion of the tumour is most firmly fixed which stretches towards the mesial fine ; whilst in carotid aneurism the firmest attachment is nnder the sterno- mastoid muscle. The third point of difference is that, on desiring the patient to make an eftbrt at deglutition, the enlai-ged thyi’oid body moves with the larymx and trachea. Cysts in the thyroid hodtj are of more common occurrence than pulsating bronchoceles, and sometimes equally difficult of diagnosis. Dupuytren has pointed out that, when these cysts are tapped, the pulsation often becomes stronger, and the fluid, which on first flomng is serous, may at last become pm-e ai-tcrial blood, so that the Siu’geon may suspect that he has punctiu’cd an aneurism. TREATiiKNT.—Digital Compression has of late years been successfully employed for the treatment of carotid aneiuism. A case of anemism of the common cai’otid ai'tery, cured by intermittent digital compression, has been recorded by Rouge of Lausamie. The patient was a male, aged C8. Com- pression was made by placing the thumb against the anterior edge of the sterno-mastoid and the next three fingers under the posterior edge of the muscle ; the artery was thus seized and compressed. This avoided any pres- sm-e on the pneumogastric nerve, which was supposed to be the cause of the pain usually caused by attempts to compress the carotid. The compression was applied for seventeen days dining seven or eight horns each day ; and at the end of the time the man ivas cm-ed. In addition to this. Holmes has col- lected four successful cases by Sheppard, Kerr, Humphry, and Gay, and two unsuccessful by Dc Castro and Delore. The pressm-e should, if possible, be applied above the transverse process of the sixth cervical vertebra, so as to avoid compressing the vertebral artery at the same time. Ligature.—Since the time when Sir A. Cooper first ligatm’ed the carotid, in 1805, the means on which the Surgeon almost always relies for the cure of aneurism of this vessel is deligation of the artery at a distance from the sac. AVhen the anemism is so situated that a sufficient extent of healthy ^■essel exists between the sternum and the base of the tumour to admit of the applica- tion ol a ligature, the Hunterian operation may be practised. • If, however, the root or lower portion of the artery be so involved that there is no room to apply the ligatme between the heart and the seat of the disease, the distal operation may be performed. Ligature of the Carotid.—When the Surgeon can choose the seat at udiich to ligature the artery, he usually selects the part of the vessel which bisects the angle formed by the anterior edge of the sterno-mastoid with the omo* hyoid muscle. I he course of the artery is marked by a line draum fromSPECIAL ANEURISMS. 90 the stomo-clavicnlar articulation to a point midway between the angle of the jaw and the mastoid process. The artery is reached by making an incision, about three inches in length, over this course upon the anterior edge of the sterno-mastoid, which is the directing line and a sure guide to the artery. After diA’iding the integument, the platysma, the subcutaneous fascia, and areolar tissue, and turning outAA-ards the edge of tbe sterno-mastoid, the sheath of the vessel is exposed. This must then be carefully opened toAvards its inner side over the artery and not OA'er the vein, any branches of the descendens noui neiTc being avoided. After opening the layer of cervical fascia common to both A^essels and the pneumogastric nerve, the special sheath of the artery must be carefully opened luitil the external coat is seen. The needle is then passed betAveen this sheath and the external coat through the loose areolar tissue naturally found in this situation. If this be carefully done it is alnrost impossible to wound the vein or pick up the nerve. If, hoAvever, the true sheath of the artery be not opened either of these accidents may happen. The needle must be passed ft'om without inwards, between the A’ein and artciy (Fig. 380). In performing this operation, subcutaneous vessels are occasion- ally AA'ounded, which may bleed rather freely ; if so, they should be ligatured. When the sheath is opened, the jugular vein sometimes swells up considerably, so as to obscure the artery, but by being diwn aside Avith a retractor, or repressed by the assistant’s finger, all difficulty from this source AviU cease. The pneumogastric nerve is not seen, as it lies deeply behind the vessels, and is drawn Fig. 3S0.—Incision for Ligature of the Carotid Arteir.

If the aneiu’ism haA'c attained a very consideiable size, extending low in the neck, and not leaving, perhaps, more than one inch ot clear space above the clavicle for the Surgeon to operate in, the difficulties aic necessarily very gveatly increased ; and here the best plan Avill be to diAude the . tendon of the sterno-mastoid muscle, so as to give additional space. TheEFFECTS OF LIGATURE OF CAROTIDS. 91 external portions of the stcrno-liyoid and sterno-thyi'oid muscles rnay likewiso . l)e cut across for the same pm-pose. The jugular vein in this situation lies considerably to the outside of the artery (iig. dHl). After ligature of the carotid artery, the blood is so fi-ecly conveyed to the distal side of the -N’essel, by the free communication subsisting between the arteries of opposite sides within the cranium, that a continuance and return of pulsation in the sac is of common occuiTcnce. This condition, however, usually disappears after a time by the gi’adual consolidation of the tiunour, and indeed may generally be looked upon as a fayom'able sign ; being "S'ery seldom asso- ciated with those cerebral symptoms that, as will immediately be explained, commonly prove fatal after this operation. It is interesting to observe that the collateral supply, after the ligature of the common carotid, is not afibrded by any of the branches of the corresponding vessel of the opposite side, but by the subclavian artery of the same side. In a case related by Porter, in which the right carotid had been tied, the subclavian and vertebral arteries on the same side were enlarged to at least double their natural diameters, and the chief conununications outside the skull took place between the superior and inferior thyroid arteries, which were enlarged ; whilst inside the cranium the vertebral took the place of the internal cai’otid. Supimration of ilw sac is not of very uncommon occurrence after the ligature of the carotid for aneurism—sometimes even after so considerable an interval as eight months, as happened in a case related by Post. In the majority of these instances, the patient eventually does well; but death may result by the tumour pressing upon the pharynx and lai’ynx, or by the occuiTence of secondary htemoiThage, which may take place either from the part to which the ligature has been applied, or from the suppurating sac. In the first instance, it usually occurs about the period of the separation of the ligature ; in the second, it may happen at a considerably later period, even after many weeks. As the suppuration is often due in aU probability to the proximity of the wound and the hgatme to the aneiu'ism, it has been suggested that, in such cases, it might be safer to anticipate it by laying open the sac after the application of the ligatme on the proximal side, and tying the vessel again on the distal side, thus performing a combination of Anel’s arrd the old opera- fciorr. It would appear, however, as if this were orrly substituting, with cer- tainty, one evil for another that may very possibly be avoided. Besides these, which may be looked uporr as the ordinary accidents follovfng the application of a ligature for aneurism, deligation of the carotid artery occasiorrally gives rise to serious and even fatal distrnbance of the circulation withirr the crarrirrm. Effects on the Brain of Ligature of one or both Carotids.—Many experiments have been made by Meyer, Jobert, arrd others, upon the lower animals, with the view of determinirrg the eflhet prodrreed orr the brain by the ligatrrre of the carotid arteries. But the dedrretions from these arc of no lalrre whatever wherr applied to the hurnarr subject, for the simple reasorr which appear’s to have been strangely overlooked), that irr rrrany of the lower animals on which the observations w^ere made, as the dog and rabbit, for instance, the common carotid arteries are of secondary irnportarree so firr as the cerebral circulation is concerned, being destined principally for the supply of the external parts of the head—the brain deriving its chief supply92 SPECIAL ANEURISMS. from tlie vertcbrals ; whilst in other .animals, as the horse, the brain derives nearl}’’ the whole of its blood from the carotids, and but a very small quantity from the A’ertebr.als. Hence, in one case the csirotids may be ligatured without danger, whilst in the other their deligation is inevitably fatal. The statistics of ligature of the carotid in the human subject have been collected by Norris, Ehrmann, and others; .and more recently by Pilz of Breslau {Archiv fur KUnische Ghirurgie, 18G8), who has collected COO cases of the operation, including 27 in which the artery was tied on both sides. The causes which led to the oper.ation were, hEemorrh.age, in 228 cases ; aneurism, in 87 ; erec- tile and other tumours, 142 ; extirpation of tumours, 71 ; cerebral affections (epilepsy, &c.), .84 ; and in 38 instances the distal operation was performed for aneurisms of the aorta and innominate artery. In the 228 cases of ligatm’c for haemorrhage, the presence of cerebral symptoms is noted in G9 out of 1G7 —no information being giA'en in regal’d to G1 ; and, in these G9 cases, death took place in 40. Excluding, however, these from calculation, inasmuch as the br.ain-disorder may have been in many due to the haemorrhage rather than to the operation, we derive from Pilz’s statistics the following table showing the proportionate frequency of the occurrence of cerebral disease and of deaths fr'om this cause.

If to these cases we add 14 in which the brachio-cephalic artery was hgatiu’ed, we aret a total of 38G cases, of which 96 were attended by cerebral symptoms; or, as nearly as possible, 25 per cent. We should necessarily expect that, in those cases in which both vessels had been ligatm-ed, there would be a greater tendency to cerebral distiu’bauce than in those in which only one had been deligated. It would however appear,^ as is shown by the following table, that of twenty-seven instances in which the double operation has been performed, death is recorded to have happened but in two cases from this cause ; while in another, in which convulsions took phacc, a fatal result did not occm’, .and thi’ee other cases were attended by mere temporary disturbance of vision. In the only case (that of Mott, No. 16) n leie both carotids were ligatm’ed simultaneously, with an interv.al of only a ew minutes between the operations, coma and death resulted.LIGATURE OF BOTH CAROTIDS.

After a careful examination of tliis subject, I tbink we are warranted in coming to the following conclusions. 1. Ligatme of one carotid artery is followed by cerebral disturbance in more than one-fointb of the cases, above one-half of which are fatal. 2. '\^dien the two carotids are ligatured tvith an interval of mm days or wecics, the operation is not more frequently followed by cerebral disturbance than when only one is tied. 3. Pathological investi- gation has shown that, if the vessels be gradually and successively obliterated, the patient may hve, although one carotid and one of the vertebral arteries have been occluded by disease and the other carotid ligatured, as in a case related by Rossi. 4. As in a case i;ecorded by Davy, an individual may even live for a considerable time, though both carotids and both vertebrals be occluded—the cerebral cumulation being maintained through the medium of the anastomoses of the inferior and superior thyroids and the deep cervical with the occipital artery. 5. The reason why more or less extensive ohstruction by disease of the arteries leading to the brain may, as ajrpears from pathological records, be uirattended by cerebral disturbance, while this so frequently follows ligatiue, lies (as has been pointed out by Pilz), that in the former case the obstruction is gradual, so that the collateral circulation has time to be estab- lished, w'bdle in the latter the inteiTuption is sudden. The Cei'ebral Sym^Aoms that ai’ise from the ligature of one or both carotids may be such as depend upon a diminished supply of blood sent to the brain ; consisting of tvdtchings, tremblings or convulsive movements, syncope or gid- diness, with paralysis, sometimes with complete hemiplegia of the side ojDposite to that of the ligatured vessel, troubled 'vusion, and deafness. In other cases they appear to arise fr'om increased pressiue upon the brain—dimwsiness, stupor, coma, and apoplexy supervening. To a third order of symptoms belong those that are of an inflammatory character, usually coming on a few hoius after the operation. The cause of these symptoms is certainly the disturbance of the cerebral circulation, induced by the ligature of the carotid. ^I'hen a considerable portion of the supply of blood to the brain is suddenly cut off, two sets of symptoms may ensue—one wimediaic, the other remote. The immediate95 DISTAL LIGATURE OF THE CAROTID. symptoms arc those that generally result from functional disturbance of the brain, consequent upon too small a supply of arterial blood. They consist of syncope, trembling, twitches, giddiness, impaiiTuent of sight, and at last hemi- plco-ia. ' After this condition has been maintained for a few days, the nutrition of the organ becomes materially affected, and softening of the cerebral substance takes place; giving rise to a new and more serious set of symptoms indicative of this patiiotogical condition, such as convulsions, paralysis, and death. In other cases congestion may come on, cither by the interference ivith the letiuii of blood through the jugular vein, or as a consequence of that venous turgidity which we commonly observe after the ligature of a main arterial trunk; or perhaps coma may be induced by apoplectic effusion into a softened portion of the organ. Inflammation of the brain may come on immediately after the applieatioii of the ligature, being apparently at once induced by the disturbance of the circulation. In other cases it occurs at a later period, as the result of alteration in the structm-e of the organ. Effects on the Lungs.—Besides the brain, the lungs are not uncommonly secondarily affected after ligatiu’e of the carotid. To this condition special attention has been directed by Jobert and Miller. The lungs appear to become greatly congested, and have a tendency to run into a low form of inflammation. The cause of this congestive condition of the lungs is extremely interesting. It cannot be owing to the simple obstruction of the passage of the blood through the carotid causing a disturbance in the balance of the circulation, and thus a tendency to internal congestion ; for, if this were the ■cause, we ought to meet with it generally after ligature of the arteries of the flrst class. Nor can it be ovlng to any injury sustained by the eighth nerve during the deligation of the artery ; as in many of the instances in which it is stated to have ocemTed, there was no evidence of that nerve having been exposed or damaged, and every reason, from the knoAvn skill of the operators, to believe the contrary. I am rather inclined to look upon the unusually frequent occurrence of puhnonic congestion after ligature of the -carotid, as a secondary condition consequent upon a derangement in the functions of the brain and medulla oblongata, primarily induced by the dis- turbed state of the circulation through that organ : for we know that any cause which depresses the activity of the nervous centres tends to diminish proportionately the freedom of the respiratory movements, and thus, by interfering with the due performance of the act of respiration, disposes to •congestion oi the lungs, just as we observe to happen in injuries of the head, in apoplexy, and in the operation of the sedative poisons. It would appear from the detail of some of the recorded cases, as well as from Jobert’s experi- ment, that blood-letting is of considerable service in the removal of this condition, and should consequently not be omitted. Ligature of the Carotid on the Distal Side of the Sac.—Aneuilsin of the carotid artery, occurring low in the neck, does not admit the appli- cation of a ligature on the cardiac side of the tumour. What, then, is to be done in such to ^ case as thisShould it be left to the remote chance ■of a spontaneous cure, or should it bo subjected to surgical interference ? ■Spontaneous cure in carotid aneurism has never yet, I believe, been met with.SPECIAL ANEURISMS. 96 l^ho Surgeon, therefore, must endeavonr to treat the disease by ligature, iu'o plans of treatment are open to him—either to deligate the innominate ai'tery, or to tic the carotid on the distal side of the tumour. The fii-st alternative may fairly bo set aside ; for not only are the cases in -which it is possible to find room between the sternum and the sac extremely rare, but, even were sucli an instance to present itself, few Surgeons would, I think, be justified in undertaking an operation which has only once succeeded, even (p. 110) in the most skilful hands ; we are consequently reduced to the alternative of ligaturing the artery on the distal side of the sac. But although this operation is the only alternative that presents itself, yet its application in practice is attended by serious difficulties and pei-plexities ; for the Surgeon must be able to satisfy himself that it is actually an aneurism of the root of the carotid -with which he has to do, and that it is not the trunk of the innominate or the arch of the aorta that is affected. The difficulty in doing this is far greater than would at first appear ; for, on examining the details of eight cases in wdiich the distal operation has been performed for supposed carotid aneurism, three must be excluded; as, after death, the tumour was found to arise from the aortic arch. In the annexed table will be found the result of seven cases, in which the carotid artery has been tied for aneurism of its root on the distal side of the sac. I have excluded an eighth case, as there is reason to believe that in it the artery was not ligatured, but a portion of the sheath accidentally tied instead—an accident, by the way, which S6dillot has witnessed, which Norris states also to have occurred at the New York Hospital, and which I have kno-wn happen to a most excellent Siu-geon in the case of ligature of the femoral artery.

Thus we find that in every case the tiunonr, immediately on the ligatiu-e being tightened, underwent a considerable diminution in its bulk, with cornigation of the integuments ■covering it, and considerable subsidence in the force of its pulsations. In one .case that of Bush—respiration, Avhich before the operation had been attended with great difficulty, became easy ; and in two others inflammation of the sac took place ; being in one (that of ’Wardrop) unattended by bad consequences, and in the other (Demme’s case) followed by death. It is not safe to deduce any general conclusion from so small a number of cases ; yet the result of these is so uniform, that I have no hesitation in stating it as my opinion that, Avhetherwe regard the principle on which this operation is foimded, the amount of success which has hitherto attended it, the necessarily fatal result of these cases if left to themselves, or the absence of any other means that hold out a Teasonable hope of benefit, the Siu’geon is justified in resorting to the hgature of the trunk of the common carotid on the distal side of the sac, in cases of aneiu'ism limited to the root of that vessel. ANEUKISM OP THE INTERNAL CAROTID. The Internal Carotid Artery may be the subject of aneurism before or after it has passed through the carotid canal and entered the ca^fity of the skuU. The symptoms of these two classes of cases differ necessarily in almost every respect, as likewise do the termination and the susceptibility of the case to surgical interference. Extracranial Aneurism.—When an aneiu'ism affects the trunk of the internal carotid before its entrance into the skull, the symptoms presented by ‘this disease do not materially differ from those of aneurism at the bifiu’cation, ■or of the upper part of the common carotid, except in one important respect, which was, I beheve, first pointed out by Porter of Dubhn—\iz., tendency to the extension of the tumour inwards towards the pharynx, and to its protru- ■sion into that cavity. The reason of this is obvious ; when we consider the anatomical relations of the internal carotid artery, we at once see that its phai'yngeal aspect is that ivhich, if one may so term it, is the most superficial, ■and that between it and the surface the smallest amount of soft parts inter- venes—nothing lying between the vessel and the mucous membrane except the thin paper-like constrictor, some lax areolar tissue, and a few filaments •of the superior laryngeal nerve ; whilst externally there are interposed be- tween it and the integument the layers of the cervical fascia, the margin of the stenio-mastoid, the digastric and three styloid muscles, and the styloid process. hen dilatation, therefore, of the vessel takes place, it has a necessary ten- deiicy to push fonvards that part of its covering where it meets with least resistance ; and, this being to the pharyngeal side, more or less prominence will •consequently be found in this ca-vity. In a case that occurred to Syme, this was especially well marked, the aneurism of the internal carotid simulating closely an abscess of the tonsil. In two cases related by Porter in the seven'^ VOL. II. IISPECIAL ANEUPJSMS. 98 toenth volume of the DuUin Journal of AMical Sciencp, this ^Yas one of the most marked features : tlie “ appearances of the tumour (as seen by the moutli) Avero most alarming ; the pulsation could be distinctly seen, and the blood ahnost felt under the mucous membrane ; it seemed ready to give Avay and burst into the mouth every moment.” Treatment.—The treatment of these cases does not differ from that of aneurisms connected AAuth the carotid arteries, and seated at tlie upper part of the neck ; but atc are not in possession of a sufficient number of facts to enable us to determine AAuth any degree of precision Avhat the result of surgical inter- ference in them is likely to be. If Ave could gh'e an opinion from the limited number of cases at present before the profession, aa^o should feel disposed not to entertain a A'ery favoiuable opinion of the result of the Hunterian operation, as applied to aneiuism of the internal carotid outside the skull. This is doubtless OAAung to the situation of the aneurism against the mucous membrane of the mouth, being such that the siurounding tissues do not exercise a suffi- cient amount of pressure against the sac after the ligature of the vessel to alloAV the efficient deposition of lamellated coagulum, and consequent occlusion of the artery leading into it, Avhich, in accordance Avith the principles that have been laid cIcaati in speaking of the Hunterian operation, are necessary to success. INTRACRANIAL ANEURISM. Aneiu’isms Avithin the skull may arise from any of the arteries that are met Avith in this situation, though some are much more liable than others to the j occurrence of this disease. Of G2 cases noticed by Sir W. Hull, the basilar artery Avas the seat of disease in 20 cases, and the middle cerebral in 15. In 8 of the remaining cases, the internal carotid Avas affected as it lay by the seUa Turcica ; and in 6 others the anterior cerebral artery AA^as the seat of aneurism. The vertebral arteries and their branches Avere affected in 28 cases, and the carotids and their branches in 34. The greater frequency of this disease in the basilar artery may probably be dependent on its large size, and the consequently greater impetus of the blood to it. Causes.—The causes of intracranial aneiuism are A^eiy obsciue. It might be supposed that the comparatively small diameter of the arteries Avithin the skull Avould render them Mttle liable to the occiurence of spontaneous aneurism, Avere it not that the anatomical characters and physiological relations of these vessels predispose considerably to the occurrence of this affection ; there being no other set of arteries in the body of the same size as these Avithin the skull in which spontaneous aneurism so frequently occurs. This can only be accounted for by the thinness of their coats and want of an external cellular sheath ren- dering them unable to support the increased pressure frum AAdthin, to which ' they are occasionally subjected in consequence of the alteration in pressure of the cerebral circulation at different periods, the result ot some variation in the relative quantities of the different fluids within the skull, or of determination of blood to the brain. This Avould more particularly be the case if their natural elasticity had already been impaired by the occurrence of athei’omatous or other degeneration of their coats. As these changes are the natural consequences99 PATHOLOGY OF INTRACRANIAL ANEURISM. of advance in af?e, we shall find the tendency to the occmrence of this disease increase with advancing years. Thus, accoi’ding to Sir William Gull, of 58 cases in which the patient’s age is given, only 12 cases occurred in persons under twcnty-fi-\'e, 5 of the patients being under twenty ; of the remaining 40 cases, 13 occurred in persons under forty; of the remaining 33, 2!) were met with between forty and sixty, and 4 in persons above sixty. Of the 58 cases, 35 were males, and 23 females. Church believes that, in the young, intracranial aneurism is due to embolism ; partial obstruction and consequent dilatation of the artery leading to interference with its nutrition and degeneration of its coats. The immediate exciting cause of the disease is most commonly involved in obsciu-ity : sometimes it may be traced to a blow on the head, to a fall or con- cussion, or to excess in di'inking ; but more frequently the symptoms manifest themselves suddenly, Avithout being in any way attributable to such external influences, and occur in vigorous and apparently healthy persons. Pathology.—Intracranial aneurisms are almost always formed by the uni- form ddatatiou of the Avhole of the calibre of the artery—the false or sacculated vai-iety being rarely if eA'er met with: I am not acquainted Avith any instance of this. The coats of the arteries in this situation being very thin, and unprovided Avith any external cellular sheath that would support the impetus of the blood, rupture of the vessel would rather occxu- than partial dilatation, if oue portion only of the circumference Avere diseased. Oc- casionally, though rarely,_ the dilatation is fusiform : when this does occur, it is pro- bably confined to the basdar artery (Fig. 382). The disease Avould appear to be of sIoav gi-owth, and the sac sometimes becomes Fig. 382.—Fusiform Aneurism of B.osiiar Artery laid open. filled With laminated coagula so completely as to occlude the orifice of the artery from which it springs. results is some- mes considerable : thus, in a case of aneiuism of the basilar artery, that occurred some years ago at the University College Hospital, the tumoiu Avas cxioeM Ihif sL?

The one on the left side Avas the largest; that on the right side communicated AAfith the caAity of the artery, which Avas not the case Avith the other.” A case occurred in University College Hospital some years ago, under the care of A. T. Thomson, in Avhich a someAAdiat similar condition existed. A man, forty-nine years of ago, had fallen on his head some months before ad- mission into the Hospital. Since then he had been garrulous, silly, and very in-itable—becoming readily intoxicated. He suddenly became insensible and comatose, Avith vomiting and laborious breathing ; he could close both eyes, but the right pupil Avas dilated ; the left side was paralysed. He Avas treated for apoplexy, and became slightly better, but died in ten days from the first attack. On examination, an aneurism a little larger than a hazel-nut Avas found on the trunk of the right carotid, where it gave off the middle cerebral artery, and another small one on the com’se of that artery. There was a globular aneurism on the corresponding artery of the opposite side ; the basilar artery was thickened, Avhite, and opaque, as were also the other larger arteries of the brain ; there Avas softening of both anterior cerebral lobes, especially the right one. The arteries of the brain are very commonly healthy in these cases. Out of four instances of intracranial aneurism that have fallen under my observation, the other vessels of the brain have been healthy in three cases, and atheroma- tous in but one. In one case I have seen aneurism Avithin the skull associated Avith aneurism elseAvhere—in the thoracic aorta. PaBSSURE-EFFECTS.—The pressm’e exercised by an aneurismal sac situated Avithin the skull is always exclusively directed against the yielding cerebral sub- stance, which is often extensiA'ely disorganised. The bones of the skull, how- ever close their proximity to the sac may be, frequently escape, and seldom suffer much. This peculiarity in the effects of anem’ism in this situation may be partly OAving to the A’^ery dense and compact character of the inner layer of the skull, but is doubtless principally due to the very soft and yielding nature of the contents of the caAuty. Absorption of the subjacent bone, howeA’er, sometimes takes place to a limited extent; thus in one case (Moore s) the body of the sphenoid bone was indented and partially absorbed. The parts compressed in each case aauII A'ary according to the situation of the tumoiu’. But those that principally suffer are necessarily those seated at the base of the brain, and forming the floor of the lateral ventricles. In Moore’s case, one of the optic nerves was flattened by the pressure of the substance of the anterior lobe ; the lamina perforata, the roots of the olfactory tract, the anterior part of the corpus striatum, and a considerable quantity of the neigh- bouring Avhite matter of the anterior lobe, Avere removed. ^ In a case by Lager, the portio dura of the right side Avas paralysed Irom this cause. In IL B. Smith’s case, the floor of the third ventricle, the tuber cinoreum, and the origins of the optic and olfactory nerves, suffered ; the optic nci’A e of the opposite side Avas flattened and softened. Besides the changes that take place in the cerebral substance as the resi t oSY.UPTOMS OF INTllAGRANIAL AFEURISM. lor pressure, importimfc lesions may be met with as the effeet of tlie interruptioii Avhich the presenee of tlie aneurism olfers to the circulation in and nutrition ot the cerebral hemispheres. Thus, in the ease of aneurism of both intenial carotids that has already been referred to as occurring at University Coilego Hospital, there was white softening of both the anterior cerebral lobes ; and this lesion was most marked on the side that corresponded to the largest aneurism, and where consequently, it may be supposed, the greatest amount of obstruetion to the eireulation existed. SniPT03is.—The symptoms of aneurism within the skull are extremely equivocal ; and, indeed, aneurism of large size may exist at the base of the brain Avithout occasioning any symptoms Avhatevcr. An interesting instance of this occiiiTed at University College Hospital in 1848. A man, thirty-seven years of age, died of pulmonaiy apoplexy and chronic pneumonia of the left lung, consequent upon the pressure of an aneurism of the commencement of the descending aorta on the pulmonary veins of that side. On examining the head after death, an aneurism of the basilar artery as large as a hazel-nut was met Avith, of which no suspicion had been entertained during life, there having been no head-symptoms whatever ; the sac of the aneurism was veiy tliin, and there was much atheromatous degeneration in the vertebral arteries. The only symptoms that are of constant occiurence, when this disease goes on to a fatal termination, are those of hemiplegia and apoplexy. These may come on suddenly without any previous warning ; or they may be preceded by a train of phenomena indicative of the existence of chronic disease within the cranial cavity. The most constant of these lAlienomena is pain ; which affects, hoAvever, great variety, both in extent and in character. It may be diffused, or may occupy a fixed point; it may be continuous or intermitting ; it may be increased by movement, or accompanied by peculiar sensations, as of pulsation or of opening and shutting the top of the cranium. 'The sight and hearing are often impaired. Dimness of sight, dilatation of one or both pupils, photophobia, diplopia, and loss of vision have been noticed in seA'eral of the cases recorded ; ptosis has also been met Avith, from pressure on the thud nerve by aneurism of the posterior communicating artery. Buzzing noises in the ears, and deafness, are also not uncommon symptoms ; deafriess, more particidarly, appears to be a phenomenon of frequent occiUTence. 1 he patient rarely loses the poAver of articulation and of deglutition; im- pairment of these functions, howcA’cr, has been met AAdth. There may be paralysis of the side of the face, shaking palsy, or complete hemiplegia ; or fits of an cjnleptic nature may occur. The mental condition may undergo changes indicative of chronic disease of the brain. There may be depression of spirits, listlessness, or, as Avas noticed in the case above related, the temper may beeome irritable, and the patient be garrulous or silly. In- sanity has been notieed in one case. As is ahvays the case in cerebral affections, the gastrie functions are often impaired. * Ikit veiy frequently ]io premonitory symptoms manifest themselves ; the patient being suddenly seized when apparently in good health, with apoplexy AA’hich terminates rapidly in death. ^ In some cases the presence of aneurism has been detected by a loud rough orSPECIAL ANEURISMS. 102 “ whizzing ” noise being heard on the application of a stethoscope over one side of the head, and, perhaps, being audible to the patient. This sign, however, exists in but few cases ; but when it does occur, it is uncpiestionably the most pathognomonic of all. I am not aware that it has been met with in any form of cerebral disease except intracranial aneurism. Thus it will be seen by a reference to this list of symptoms that, with the exception of the whizzing noise, no special signs are afforded by aneurisms within the skull, which will enable us to distinguish between the symptoms occasioned by their presence and those of other tumoims of the brain, and of organic cerebral disease. Causes of Death.—The fatal termination may occur from one of four causes. 1. The tumoiu’ may exercise such upon the ivliole cerebral wzassas to occasion death. This mode of termination is rare. I am acquainted \nth one case of this description, which is reported by Ruschenberger. The symptoms in this case were very remarkable, consisting of complete hemiplegia of the left side, with involuntary antero-posterior vibration of the head and body, and paralysis agitans of the right leg. The patient slept heavily, with loud snoring ; he ate voraciously, but occasionally had considerable difficulty in deglutition and articnlatiou ; his intellect was clear, but very slow. After death, an aneiu’ism of the basilar artery as large as a pigeon’s egg, containing an irregular very hard dry clot of blood, was found pressing on the pons Varolii. The sac had given way at one point, extravasation taking place into the sub- stance of the pons, which was softened, and of a bluish colour. 2. The most frequent mode in which death takes place in these cases is by the sudden rupture of the sac and extravasation of blood into the cavity of the arachnoid and the meshes of the pia mater at the base of the brain, or into the lateral ventricles—either from the aneinism projecting into them and there rig 884.—View of the same Aneurism from below, imbedileil in substance of Hemi- sphere.

When this mode of termination occurs.CAUSES OF DEATH IN INTRACRANIAL ANEURISM. 103 tlicre are occasionally no warning nor premonitory symptoms of an impending dan-cr • the patient, when apparently in good health, being struck down by an attack of apoplexy which is speedily fatal. More frequently a senes of those symp- toms that have ah-oady been mentioned as attending many cases of this disease, precede the fixtal event for a longer or shorter time. When ruptiu-e of the sac and extravasation of blood take place, death is inevitable ; at least, I am not acquainted with any case in which the appearance found after death con- vei-ted me to the belief that the patient had even temporarily recovered from this condition. Death from ruptmc of the sac appears to be most fr-equent in younger sub- jects. In the later period of life, aneinism is commonly associated with atheromatous disease of the vessels generally, which may cause death by softening and effusion of blood. According to GruU, of 20 cases occm’ring in persons under thirty-five years of age, IG (or 80 per cent.) were fatal from rupture of the sac ; while in 37 cases over thu'ty-five, death occurred from this cause in only 14, or 38 per cent. 3. Death may result from another cause than the pressure of the aueurismal sac or its rupture and the extravasation of its contents—viz., from softening or (Usorganisalion of the substance of the brain to a greater or less extent, in con- sequence of the obstruction offered to the passage of the blood through the aueurismal vessel. In the case of aneurism of both carotids, already mentioned as having occurred at University College Hospital, this Avas the case ; both anterior cerebral lobes Avere affected with white softening, and this condition was especially observable on that side on which the aneurism was largest. 4. Lastly, death may be produced by the mere irritation occasioned by the pressm’e of one or more aneiuismal tumoiu’s Avithin the cranium. Of this an interesting example is afforded by the history of a case of anemdsm of both external carotids, contained in the Museum of the College of Surgeons, and related by Sir Gr. Blane in the Transactions of the Society for the Improvement of Medical and Ghirurgical Knoivledge, vol. ii. p. 192. In this case the patient, a lady aged 69, had suffered for foin yeai-s fr'om attacks of giddiness, headache, and imperfect Ausion ; about sixteen months before her death she became insane, recovered, and then relapsed twice into the same state. After having regained her senses for some months, she became affected Avith giddiness, red- ness of the eyes, and Auolent maniacal delirium, Avhich continuing for some Aveeks caused her death. After death the folloAving appearances Avere found. “ Upon examining the body, there Avas no appearance in the brain itself that could in anyway account for the symptoms. There was, indeed, a gi’eater quantity of fluid than common in the ventricles, and the surface of it was moister than it is usually found in a sound state ; but in all other cases AAhich have occurred to me of organic affections of the brain proving fatal, except those which are sudden, such as apoplexy, there has been a preternatural quantity of fluid in its A'cntricles. There were also spicula of bone in the membrane forming the falx. The inner substance of the erm-a cerebri Avas of a brown colour, and more tender than natural. The optic nerves AA^ere smaller than natmal, as if they had been Avasted. The septum lucidum Avas more than usually dense. “ But the morbid appearance in this case, which was so singular, and toSPECIAL ANEUPJSMS. M-hicli tlic symptoms of complaint seemed chiefly referable, was two bulbs, about c-ei^glitlis of an inch in diameter, filling up the hollow on each side of the sella Turcica, which were evidently dilatations of the carotid arteries, and, from their being filled with laminte of coagulated blood, there could be no doubt of their being aneurisms of those artei-ies. The dissection was made by iMr. Hunter, assisted by Mr. Home, in the presence of Dr. Jonner and myself, and all concurred in the opinion that these tumours were aneimsms. The one on the left side Avas the largest. That on the right side communicated with the caAuty of the artery, Avhich was not the case with the other.” Treatment.—In the treatment of intracranial aneurism there is usually little to be done, the nature of the case not being sufficiently obvious in the majority of instances to justify active measures. Should, hoAveA'er, the loud rough Avhiz be distinctly audible over one side of the head, more especially about the base of the skull, or by appbcation of the stethoscope to the mastoid process, and should symptoms of cerebral compression begin to manifest them- sch'es, ligature of the carotid artery on the affected side may Avith propriety be practised. This has been successfully done in a most interesting and instruc- tive case of intracranial aneurism by Coe of Bristol; and in one at UniA'ersity College Hospital, by Berkeley Hill. INTRAORBITAL ANEURISM. Intraorbital Aneurisms were for a long time considered by Simgeons to be of the natime of erectile tumoims ; but the error of this opinion has been pointed out by Busk, and more recently by Hunneley, who has conclusively shown that, except in those very rare cases in which a pulsating tumoim of the orbit has. been congenital, or has appeared shortly after birth, or has been associated Avith iimA'oid tissue developed in the eyehds, it must be looked upon as being a circumscribed aneimism. The vessel affected appears to be in some instanees the ophthalmic artery itself; in other instances it Avould appear that the tumour is developed within the cranium, springing from the carotid artery, the ophthalmic being but secondarily affected. More recently Delens of Pai-is has recorded four cases verified by post mortem examination, in which the symptoms arose from an arterio-venous aneurism affecting the carotid artery in the cavernous sinus. Causes.—The causes of intraorbital aneurism are in some cases very obscure ; in others, it evidently and directly has originated from a bloAV upon the head. In the first class of cases, where the disease has been of spontaneous and not of traumatic origin, the patient has suddenly felt a crack or snap in the orbit, like the “ crack of a Avhip,” or the “ snap of a gun,” and the disease has then developed itself gradually. In the other or traumatic cases, the bloAV upon tlie head has usually been seA'ere, attended in some instances AAuth symptoms of fractiu'c of the anterior part of the base of the skull. It is a remarkable circumstance that, in all the spontaneous cases on record, the disease occiu’red in Avomen, and AAuth one exception (a case of Nunneley’s), appeared on the left side. The circumscribed intraorbital aneurism has been met AAuth at all ages in adults, even in persons of advanced periods of life. Symptoms.—The first sensation experienced is, in spontaneous cases, that ofSYMPTOMS OF INTUAORBITAL ANEURISM. 105 a loud snap or crack in the orbit or head. This is followed by congestion of the conjunctiva, difficulty in opening the eyelids, a feeling of tension, and in some instances severe pain in and around the orbit. Loud whizzing bewilder- ing noises are experienced in the head, and are much increased on stooping^ 01 lyhig down. In traumatic cases, a persistence of congestion of the conjunctiya with redness and some oedema ol the eyelids, and the occurrence of noises in the head, are usually the first indications of the mischief that has occurred. In all cases, after a time, the eyeball becomes unduly prominent, and pulsation of a thrilling ^'ibratory character can be felt in the orbit: on the application of the ear, a loud whizzing bruit is discernible, which extends widely over the side of the head. The eyeball itself eventually falls into a state of chronic congestion ; chemosis ocem-s, the cornea becomes opalescent, the aqueous humour tiu’bid, and sight is impaired or lost. The bruit and pulsation are diminished or cease on compressing the carotid artery of the side affected. PuoGXOSis.—I think it is still doubtful what would happen in these cases, if the disease were left to itself ■without operation. It might be supposed that it would probably have a fatal tennination ; that the orbital plate would be perforated ; that rupture of the aneurism would take place into the cranial ca\nty, and that sudden and immediate death would occur. But experience has sho'vm that this is not necessarily so. I was consulted at the end of 18(15 by a gentleman about 44 years of age, who, in consequence of a fall on the head a few months previously, had been attacked with symptoms of aneurism of the left orbit in the most marked manner. The bruit and the pulsation were veiy loud and distinct. The eyeball was greatly protruded, the coujunctiva and eyelids were congested and swollen. Greaves of Burton, with whom I saw the case, agreed ■with me in urging ligature of the carotid artciy as the only means of ciu’e. To this the patient would not consent, and prefeiTed taking his chance. By attention to habits of life, abstinence fi’om stimulants, and ordinary medical treatment, the tumour subsided, the eye retreated within the orbit, and the symptoms diminished greatly ; so that, at the end of fourteen months from the time when I first saw him, I understand that they had to a veiy great extent disappeared. But there is reason to believe that aU the signs of intraorbital aneurism may entirely disappear, the disease undergoing a spontaneous ciu’e. Collard relates the case ol a man 41 years of age, who, in consequence of a fall on the back of his head by which he was rendered insensible, was gradually seized with symptoms of aneurism of the left orbit; bruit, pulsation, diplopia, and pro- trusion of the eyeball, together with congestion of the eyelids, being most mai’ked. After the disease had continued for a considerable length of time, the patient was put upon a coiu’se of piirgatives, A\’ith a calomel and bella- donna pill daily, and cold lotions to the forehead. Under this treatment the symptoms gi-adually subsided, and in three years and a half from the com- mencement of the disease had entirely disappeared. Collard believes that in this case there was a dilatation of the ophthalmic artery and its branches, aris- ing from and maintained by a morbid state of the ophthalmic ganglion, which furnishes vaso-motor filaments to the arteries of the eye. Tliis ganglion he believes to have been injured by contro-coup, and to have remained°in a state of hypeimsthosia, which produced dilatation of the walls of the ophthal-SPECIAL ANEUPJSMS. io6 niicartery audits branches, increase of the pulsations, and the other symptoms which have been described above. Pathology.—The precise pathological change that takes place in inducing this remarkable disease is to a ^’ory considerable degree uncertain. The earlier observers supposed that an erectile tumour, an “ aneurism by anastomosis,” formed in the orbit. The fallacy of this opinion was pointed out by Busk, who referred the symptoms to a rupture of the ophthalmic artery and the de'S’elopment of a circumscribed traumatic aneurism of that vessel, ilore recently Nunneley has called in question the coiTectness of this view, and has referred the symptoms, in some of these cases, to a peculiar vascular con- dition of the parts, dependent more upon an affection of the veins than of the arteries, and somewhat analogous to what takes place in the ex- ophthalmos of bronchocele ; and in others, in which an aneurism really exists, he has pointed out that it is situated not in the orbit, but in the cranial cavity. In these latter cases, the prominence of the eyeball is due to distension of the veins of the orbit from obstruction to the return of blood ; and the pulsation is communicated to these distended veins from the aneu- rism in the cavernous sinus. In one such case examined after death the aneurism was found to affect the carotid as it takes its last bend, and in another it was situated on the ophthalmic artery, just beside the seUa Turcica, close to its origin from the internal carotid. Of the four cases collected by Delens, in which the symptoms undoubtedly arose from arterio-venous aneu- rism in the cavernous sinus, one was spontaneous, three arose from injmy, one was fr'om a direct wound from the point of an umbrella thrust into the opposite orbit, and two were from severe blows on the head, probably accompanied by fr’actnre. Pathological anatomy has as yet thrown httle light on the true nature of the disease. In one instance in which the patient died after the hgature of the conunon carotid artery in a case which pre- sented all the phenomena of intraorbital aneurism in the most marked degree, and which was recognised as such by some of the most able ocuhsts of the day, no trace of aneiu’ism or of other vascular disease could be found on dissection. Is it possible that some derangement of the vaso-niotor influence of the sympathetic may really occasion the symptoms of increased vascular activity that are so characteristic of this singular disease ? The secondary phenomena that are observed in these cases, such as conges- tion of the eyelids, of the palpebral and ocular conjunctivm, amomiting even to chemosis in many cases, and the muddiness of the aqueous humoui and lens, are doubtless due to an interference with the return of blood from these parts tlu'ough the ophthalmic vein, to the consequent congestion of the smaller vessels and to effusion of serum into the subconjunctival areolar tissue. The protrusion of the eyeball is due to the vascular tumour, whatever its precise nature may be, and the derangement in vision to an alteration in the axis of the eye consequent on this extrusion. It is remarkable that the Inut m these cases should be so loud, not only to the patient’s own senses, but to the ear ot the Surgeon ; and this can only be accounted for by some acoustic exaggera- tion of the sound, dependent either on the thin and flaccid sides of the vessels through which the blood rushes, or on the proximity of the cranial bones, which may act as conductors of sound.ANEURISM OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. 107 Treatment.—The results of the cases that have been referred to aljove, the uncertainty in which we arc as to the real pathology of this disease, and the certainty that in some instances at least there is no true aneurismal tumour, would justify the Surgeon in having recom-sc to medical treatment, aided by digital compression of the carotid, and, perhaps, the ai^plication of ice to the forehead, before proceeding to operate. That these means are occasionally successful, there can be no doubt. Gioppi, of Padua, has recorded a case in which an intraorbital aneurism of gxeat severity was cured by intermittent digital compression. The compression was kept uj) for periods of a minute or two Avith frequent intervals ; pressure continued for more than one minute caused fainting. It Avas cm-ed in foiu' days. Vaiizetti and Scari’amuzza have published another case, in which intermittent digital compression Avas kept up for five minutes at a time. The case Avas completely cm’ed at the end of com- pression diu-ing seven hoiu’s and twenty minutes, spread over eighteen days. Should these means fail in producing a decided impression on the disease, then the only coiu’se left for the successful treatment of this formidable affection consists in the appheation of a hgatm-e to the common carotid of the side affected. This operation has been highly successful. Out of 21 cases in Avhich the operation has been performed, 15 have proved successful, there having been 3 deaths ; 2 AAme only partially successful, and in 1 the pulsation continued luiabated by the operation. Of 14 cases in Avhich it has been done in England, 13 have been cm-ed. Examination of the body after death is recorded in 2 of the fatal cases. In one, there was softening of the left hemi- sphere of the brain, and the branches of the vertebral and carotid arteries were atheromatous. In the other—a case of traumatic anem-ism—death occurred from hmmon-hage ; the carotid artery was healthy. The statistics collected by Delens, quoted by Holmes, are also remarkably favourable, for of 33 cases in Avhich the carotid has been tied for this disease, only 5 died. In 22 the cure Avas complete, in 5 partial, and in 1 the operation failed. Galvano- puncture has been tried tmee : once it failed, and once it was fatal. Coagu- lating injections have been used three times, twice with success. In a very i^erestmg case which I saw in Velpeau’s Avards in 1839, both orbits were affected ; and, as pressure on the right cai'otid arrested the pulsation and wuit m both, that artery was tied. But though the disease was cured in the lett orbit by this operation, and temporarily ai-rested in the right, it reappeared m the latter situation, and was eventuaUy cm-ed here by the ligature of the leit carotid. ° ANEUKISM OE THE SUBCLAVIAN ABTERY. .Dieurisms of the Subclavian in order of frequency betAveen those of the caiotid and of the brachio-cephalic arteries.

Of 1.0 cases collected b/poland, md;SPECIAL ANEURISMS. io8 Ill females, caiid in 4 of these iustanees the disease resulted from inimy ; in 2 cases, both arteries were affected. The disease may be seated in any part of the vessel on the right side, though most commonly it is not dilated until after it has passed beyond the scaleni. On the left side aneurism never occurs before the artery has emerged from the thorax ; and then, as on the right, it most commonly happens in the third part of the coiu’sc of the vessel. Sub- clavian aneurism may occur at any age above 21. It is most common in middle life ; and, according to Poland, is three times more frequent in Eng- land than in any other country. Symptoms.—An aneurism of the subclaidan artery is characterised by a pulsating compressible tumour of an elongated or ovoid shape, situated at the base of the posterior inferior triangle of the neck, immediately above the cla-sucle. If it be small, it will disappear behind this bone on the shoulder being raised ; as it increases in size, it fills up the whole of the space between the clavicle and the trapezius, often attaining a veiy considerable bulk. In consequence of the pressure which it exercises on the brachial plexus of nerves there is pain, often attended by numbness, and extending dovm the arm and fingers, usually with some weakness of these jjarts. In some instances there is a spasmodic affection of the diaphragm, owing to irritation of the phrenic nerve. The external jugular vein is commonly distended and varicose, with oedema of the hand and arm, or even of the side of the body. The tumour does not increase rapidly in size, owing to its being tightly compressed by the siuTonnding parts ; and, as the disease never extends inwards, it does not interfere Avith the trachea or oesophagus. In some cases it has been Imown to extend doAAmwards and backAvards, so as to implicate the pleura and the summit of the lung. DiAGifOSis.—The diagnosis of subclaA’ian aneiuism is usually easy, and presents no point of a special character. ]\Iayo, however, mentions a case in which an exostosis of the first rib j)ushed forward the subclavian arteiy in such a Avay as to cause it to simidate an aneurism, and eA'entually to arrest the pulsation in it. Results.—As a subclavian aneurism increases in size, it may become diffused, and burst either externally or into the pleural sac. A spontaneous ciue has more frequently occurred in this than in any other external aneurism. Treatment.—The treatment of subclaAdan aneurism is in the highest degree imsatisfactory. Comjiremon on the cardiac side can only be employed when the artery is so irregularly distributed that it rises sufficiently high in the neck to admit of pressure being applied betAveen the scalenus and the sac. Such a combination of irregular anatomical distributions with aneurism must of necessity be excessively rare. But in one case in AA'hich it occurred, Poland succeeded in effecting a cure by digital compression, kept up foi ninety-six hours. The tumour then Avas smaller and harder, but stiU pulsated. The patient left the Hospital, and, at the end of a month, the tumour was found to have become solid, and to have ceased to pulsate. The number of cases m Avhich compression is possible, may perhaps be increased by pcifoiming t e operation under prolonged antesthesia. Direct Pressure on the sac has succeeded. It has been tried in tlnce cases, and in all successfuUy.

ManipiiMmi, as recomineuded by Fer- <russon, has been tried five times (Holmes); once m the hands of Little suc- ce'jsfully once by Fergusson with partial success, and in the three remaining cases without any advantage. The treatment nndoubtedly deserves a further trial in these cases, when we consider the extreme danger of the disease and the oTeat ivant of success that attends other means of em’e. Ligature of the Irachio-cefhalk, and of the. sulclavtan itself, before, between, and beyond the scaleni muscles, has been practised for the cm'c of this foim of aneurism; it has likewise been proposed to apply the distal operation to the treatment of this disease, and to amputate at the shoulder-joint. YTieu an aneurism is situated on the right subclavian artery on the tracheal side of the scaleni, there is no way in which the flow of blood thi’ough it can be an-ested, except by the ligature of the brachio-cephalic artery. When it is situated beyond the scaleni, oi’ even between them, the hgatuie of the "vessel has been jiractised in the first part of its com’se before it reaches these muscles. For subcla’vdan anemdsm on the left side, in these situations, no operation conducted on the Hunterian principle would be practicable. Let us now proceed to examine the results that have attended these operative procedures. Ligature of the Brachio-Cephalic.—The brachio-cephalic artery, as may be seen by the accompanying table (p. 110), has been ligatured fourteen times, and in every instance but one with a fatal result. In four other instances the operation has been commenced, but abandoned owing to unforeseen difficulties, and this by some of the most skilful operators that their respective countries can boast of. Although, in reasoning on the propriety of performing an operation, it is not in general worth while to take into consideration the difiiculties that a Sin’geon may encounter, provided the operation be at last practicable ; yet, when we consider the fact of the ligature of the brachio-cephalic having been attempted, and in consequence of unforeseen and insurmountable difficulties left uncon- cluded in so large a proportion as one-fourth of the cases, and these in the hands of Surgeons who were as well able as any to accomplish whatever was in the power of operative siugery to do, wo may well hesitate upon the difficulties that beset tlie operation itself, before proceeding to the consideration of its results. The difficulties to which I allude do not consist merely in the position and anatomical relations of the vessel, but rather in the condition in which the artery and the adjacent structures may be found after the vessel is exposed. Thus, in Porter’s case, the aneurism, which was a large one, occupied the whole of the inferior posterior triangle of the neck, being nearly six inches broad ; as no pulsation was traceable in the vessels beyond the aneiu'ism, it was useless toSPECIAL ANEURISMS. no CASES OF LIOATUKE OP BEACHIO-CEPHALIC AHTERY.* OPKRATOlt.

On exposing the In-achio-cephalic, that vessel was found to be diseased, and it was not thought desirable to pass the ligature round it. In consecpience of the exposure of the artery, however, the pulsation in the tnmour gradually diminished, and at last ceased entirely, its hulk also becoming less. In Key’s case, it which it was impracticable to pass the ligatiu’e, it was found after death that the brachio-cephalic was diseased, being dilated imme- diately after its origin into an oblong timiour, ivhich occupied the whole of the arteiy. It is remarkable that in this case, as in Porter’s, inflammation seems to have taken place in the artery in consequence of the necessary handling to which it was subjected, and that the pulsation in the sac con- sequently diminished. The difliciflties of the operation are in themselves of serious magnitude ; arising from the depth of the vessel, from its proximity to the centre of the circulation, and from the neighbourhood of large veins, which may become tiu'gid, and a wound of which not only obscures the line of incision with venous blood, but induces a risk of the entrance of air into the circulation. But even when these have been siumounted, and the artery has been exposed, its coats may be found so diseased, or its calibre so increased, that it may be undesirable or impossible to pass a ligatme round it. The failure in deligating the artery would, however, as we shall immediately see, appear to be less disastrous in its consequences than success in that attempt ; for of the three cases that have just been referred to, in which this attempt was made and did not succeed, one was cured of the disease, the artery being obliterated by adhesive inflammation; and in another. Key’s patient, an attempt to set up this action appears to have been made, the tumour becoming solid and ceasing to pulsate ; whereas, in every case but one in which the vessel was ligatimed, a fatal result speedily ensued. The results of the ligatime of the vessel are then in the highest degvee dis- coiu’ag-ing ; for of the fourteen cases in the table in which it has been done, only one has recovered. The only successful case, that in which Smyth of Kew Orleans was the operator, is one of the most remarkable on record, but in reality affords no evidence as to the possibility of safely ligaturing the brachio- cephalic tranlv. For in this case the carotid was also tied so as to stop the regurgitant flow of blood ; yet, notwithstanding this precaution, on the fom-- teenth day severe haemon-hage to syncope occurred. This hmmorrhage recurred at intervals for a period of thirty-seven days, and was temporarily arrested by fllling the wound with shot, till, on the flfty-flrst day after the operation, a “ terrific ” haemon’hage took place, stopped by syncope. As this bleeding came from the distal side and from the subclavian artery, the vertebral was tied, ivith perfect success—no bleeding recurring. This fact is of the utmost surgical value ; it shows that the secondary hmmorrhage, which may be looked upon as the necessaiy sequence of the ligatui’e of the in- nominate artery, may be arrested and the patient’s life saved by the ligatime of the principal arterial branch that communicates with and that carries rco-ur- ptant blood into the distal end of the artery -which was originally ligatured. This fact is entirely new in operative siugery ; and the establishment of it, as well as the skill and comage that were displayed in the operative procedures required m, and the general management of this case, reflect the highest creditSPECIAL ANEURISMS. 1 12 on Smyth. I am indebted to him for the further history of this unique case. After ten years of good health, in which the patient was able to follow his emplojunent as a ship’s steward, the pulsation returned and the timiour reached n size larger than before. Thinking it might be fed by the internal mammary, Smyth ligatmed that ^csscl, but without any result. About six months aftci* an abscess formed over the sac, and the anem-isni became diffused into it, and as a last effort to save the patient’s life, Smyth performed the heroic operation of laying open the sac. The ha3morrhage was profuse, and the openings of the ^ esscl into the sac could not be seen, so that the operator had to content him- self with plugging the wound. The patient died a few days after. The post mortem examination showed that the circulation had been chiefly carried by means of the anastomoses between the aortic intercostals and the branches of the axillary artery. In three more cases the operation of ligature of the innominate is said to have been tried udth speedily fatal results; and in four cases, after being commenced, it was abandoned. Death occurred from secondary htemorrhage in seven cases ; from inflammation of the lungs or pleura in one ; from pericarditis in one ; from diseased kidney in one ; from phlebitis and suppuration in one ; and in three from causes that are not mentioned. In one case, that of HaU, the artery was transfixed by the aneurism-needle ; Iia3moiThage occm’red at the time, which was arrested by plugging, and did not recur, the patient dying from other causes. In three cases, those of Mott, Bland, and Lizars, the htemorrhage came on shortly after the separation of the ligatiu-e ; but in Drafe’s it did not occm- for fifty-one days after this, the cicatrix in the artery having then probably given way under the influence of some imprudent movement on the part of the patient. In Cooper’s second case, the patient appeared to be going on well for some weeks, when secondary haemor- rhage appeared. Learning that nothing further could be done, the patient tore oft the bandages Avhen alone, and bled to death. In Bickersteth’s case, the artery had been injured by the previous compression applied by means of a leaden vdre. The ligatiu’e was applied on each side of the bruised spot; but secondary hEemorrhage proved fatal on the sixth day. With such results as these, there can be but one opinion as to the extreme danger of such an operation. As its performance has hitherto in every instance, except in Smyth’s, entailed death, and generally a speedy death, it should without doubt be undertaken with much hesitation ; and there can be but few cases in which a Surgeon would be induced, in the face of the consequences that have hitherto invariably followed the apphcation of a ligatine to the brachio-cephalic artery for subclavian aneiu-ism, again to have recourse to such a procedure. Ligature of the Sxihclavian.—This artery has been tied in the third part of its course for subclavian or subclavio-axillary aneurism in 21 cases (Poland). Of these, nine recovered. The sac was punctmed in two cases—by Liston and Travers. The majority of the deaths were from htemorrhage. Warren relates a remarkable case occurring in a lady aged thirty, who was afflicted by an aneurism just above the clavicle. The patient was excessively deformed from club-foot and ciu’vatm*e of the spine, so that the two fii'st ribs rose above the clavicle, passing obliquely across the neck and carrying the artery upwards andLIGATURE OF THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY. 113 backwards, so that it lay parallel to, and about an inch fi-oni, the external border of the trapezius. This peculiarity of position enabled AVarren to tie the artery on the cardiac side of the tumour, and the case had a successful issue. It the aneurism be situated on the right subclavian artery, between or beyond the scaleni, that vessel has been Lujatured on ihe Tracheal stele of these muscles ; on the left side this operation is scarcely practicable, on account of the depth at which the artery is situated. It has, however, been performed in one ease by Dr. J. R. Rodgers of New York ; and it was attempted once by Sir Astley Cooper, who failed to secure the vessel, and is said to have wounded the thoracic duct. AA'hcn we consider the anatomical relations of that portion of the right subclavian which intervenes between the brachio-cephalic artery and the tracheal edge of the scalenus anticus muscle, we are at once struck with the great difficulties of this undertaking ; and when we reflect on the position in which the ligature vill be placed between the oiiAvard cun'ent of blood in the brachio-cephahe on the one side, and the regurgitant stream conveyed by the vertebral, the thyi’oid axis, the internal mammaiy and superior intercostal, into the subclavian, immediately beyond the seat of deligation on the other side, Ave can scarcely, in accordance Avith those principles on Avhich the formation of a coagulum AAithin a hgatured vessel takes place, anticipate any but the most disastrous results. In reference to the mere difficulties of the operation, Fergusson justly charac- terises it as the most serious in Surgery ; the proximity of the common carotid artery on one side, the internal jugular vein on the other, the vena innominata Ijelow, the par vagum and numerous small venous trunks in front, the reciuTent laryngeal nerve and pleura behind, constitute relations of sufficient importance to justify Fergusson’s opinion. But supposing these difficulties overcome, and the ligature applied, this must be situated, as has just been stated, in such a position, Avith a strong current of blood flowing upon each side of it, as to render the formation of an internal coagulum, and consequently occlusion of the arteiy, impossible, and thus to lead inevitably to the occurrence of fatal hiemorrhage on the separation of the hgatme. Besides the danger of secondary hiemorrhage fi’om these causes, there Avould be the additional risk of the coats of the artery being diseased, as we commonly And them to be in a more or less morbid state in the immediate vicinity of aneimisms ; and, thus being- rendered insusceptible of healthy inflammation, ulceration and sloughing* would take place along the track of the ligature, causing the probability of a recurrence of hiemorrhage. Thus, in Colles’s case it was found, on exposing the subclaA'ian arteiy, that the aneurism had extended in such a way toAvards the carotid, that it Avas doubtful whether any part of the affected vessel continued sound. On exposing fully, it Avas found that only a space of the vessel three lines in length remained free between the sac and the bifurcation of the brachio-cephalic, and it Avas in this narroAV space that the ligature was applied. The subclaAian has been ligatured on the tracheal side of the scaleni muscles in fourteen cases, aU of which proved fatal: twelve from hcemor- rhage, one from inflammation of the pericardium and pleura, and one from pyiemia. The cases are as folloAv :— VOL. II. ISPECIAL ANEURISMS. 114 SURGEON. KKX. AfiK. 'date OE death. cause or DEATH. COLLES. Mott. Hayden. O’Keilly. Partridge. Liston.* LiSTON.f CUVILLIER.f Eodgers.

Thus it will be seen that, while this operation is bad in principle, it is most unfortunate in practice. This appaUing- Table needs no comment. It is, to my mind, conclusive as to the merits of the operation, the patient having, in every case but two, been earned off by secondary haimorrhage from the distal side of the ligature, in con- sequence of the close jiroximity of numerous collateral branches (Fig. 385); and in the two ex- ceptional cases the operation, although performed skilfully, proved fatal in one instance from periearditis and pleiu'isy, and in the other fr-om pyaemia, before the period at which secondary htemonhag-e might have been expected. Liston, in one case, hgatm-ed the root of the common carotid, as well as that of the subclavian, hoping in this way to diminish the risk of secondary hcemorrhage, by arresting the current of blood which, by sweeping into the carotid past the mouth of the sub- clavian, would necessarily wash away any coagulum that might be formed in this artery. But his expectations were not realised : htemorrhage took place as usual, and fr-om that portion of the artery which lay on the distal side of the ligatm-e, the blood having been carried into this end of the vessel in a retrograde coin-se, through the connection existing between the vessels arising fr-om it at this point, and Fig. 38G.—Ligature of the Subclavian aud Carotid for Subclavian Aneurism.

Ponei.treatment of subclavian aneurism. 115 those on the opposite side of tlie head and neck, as illustrated by the annexed cut (Fi«^ 3S0), taken from the preparation of the case in the University College Museum' Indeed, this is the great danger to bo apprehended after ligature of the subclavian artery on the tracheal side of the scaleni, depending as it does on the anatomical relations and connections of the vessel, vhich no skill on the part of the operator can in any way lessen, and which, in my opinion, ought certainly to cause the operation of ligature of the subclavian in the first part of its coui'sc to be banished Iroin surgical practice. Hobart of Cork ligatured the first part of the right subclavian and the root of the carotid in a case of aortic aneurism supposed to be innominate. The ligature separated safely from the subclavian, but the patient died on the sixteenth day of hemorrhage from the carotid, brought on by a fit of passion, in which she threw her bolster at the nurse. Smyth of New Orleans tied the innominate, the carotid, and subsequently the right vertebral, with eventual success (Table, p. 110). The carotid only was tied by Butcher, with a fatal result. ■\Vheu an aneurism is situated on the subclavian artery, in the posterior inferior triangle of the neck, it is necessarily impossible to ligatm-e that vessel beyond the scaleni,‘as there would not be sufiicient room for the exposiu’e of the ai'tery, which, even if laid bare, would in all probability be found in too diseased a condition to bear the application of a ligatm-e. Thus it will be seen that, in every case, except Smyth’s, in which an aneurism of the subclavian artery has been subjected to operation, whether by ligatm-e of the brachio-cephalic or of the subclavian itself infernal to tlie scaleni, the result has been a fatal one. As this unfortunate termination is in no way to be attributed to want of skill on the part of the operators,—who have been, without exception, men greatly distinguished for the possession of this very quality,—but is solely dependent on certain anatomical pecubarities in the an-angement of these vessels, by Avhich their successful ligature has been rendered aU but impossible, a repetition of these attempts, which may hasten the patient’s death, can scarcely be considered justifiable. What then are we to do ? Ai-e we to leave patients labouring- under anem-ism of the subclavian artery to ine-sitable death, v-ithout making an effort to save them ? Or does sm-gery offer other modes of treatment besides those just mentioned, by which we may hope to arrive at more successful resrrlts ? Without mentioning direct pressm-e, manipulation, or gah'ano-pmrctm-e. which are certainly deserviirg of further trials iir combinatiorr rvith appropriate constitutional treatment, three modes of treatment present themselves :— 1. Compression of the Ar-tcry where it passes over the Fust Bib, and conse- quently on the Distal Side of the Tumour. ■>. Ligature of it on the Distal Side, above or below the Clavicle. 3. Amputation at the Shoulder-joint, arrd Distal Ligature of the Artery. 1. Compression of the Artery on the Distal Side of the Sac could only be effected where it crosses the fii-st rib, and consequently would only be applicable to aneurisms of the first part of tins vessel. This plan has never been tried : partly, perhaps, on account of the difficulty in applying pressm-e in this situation, and partly, probably, on account of the want of success that has attended procedures of this kind when applied to vessels in other situations.ii6 SPECIAL ANEURISMS. The difficulty in applying the compression might, T think, he overcome hy the use of the instrument of which a representation is given by Bonrgery. The efficiency of the compression would be materially increased l^y the employment of direct pressure on the tumour, or of galvano-punctime at the same time, and in this way a coagulum might be formed in the sac. Although too much ought not to be expected from this mode of treatment, yet I think it might with propriety be tried in cases of the kind that has been mentioned. 2. Distal Ligature of the Subclavian Artery in the Third Part of its Course has been suggested, and may, perhaps, hold out some prospect of I success in cases of aneurism situated between or internal to the scaleni. In an i ancurismal sac springing from the artery in this situation, the principal current ' of blood woidd, in all probability, be that which is destined for the supply of the upper extremity. Some of the branches arising from the artery before it has passed beyond the scalenus anticus would, doubtless, be more or less compressed, and thus obhterated, by the tumoiu’; or they might be obstructed by an extension of the laminated fibrine over their orifices. If, therefore, the supply to the upper extremity could be cut off, therp might be a possi- bility of those changes taking place within the sac which are necessary for the obliteration of its cavity. The principal obstacles to this desirable result would necessarily be the transversales colli and humeri arteries ; which, being- the two vessels that are more particularly destined to cany on the circulation in the upper extremity after the ligature of the subclavian, Avould necessarily, if not occluded, undergo dilatation, and thus continue to draw too large a current of blood through the sac for stratification of its contents to take place y and, if they were occluded, there Avould be danger of gangrene of the arm from insufficient vascular supply. Dupuytren ligatured the axillary artery under the pectoral muscles for a case- of subclavian aneurism, two arterial branches being diAuded in the incisions through the fat and areolar tissue; and the patient died on the ninth day. This operation could not be expected to succeed ; for between the ligatime and I the sac are the large and numerous alar, acromial, and thoracic branches of the axillary artery, which would continue to be fed by a current sent through the tumour, and thus preclude the possibility of its contents being sufficiently stationary for ultimate contraction and ciu’e to result. Laugier performed the distal operation in a supposed case of subclaArian anem-ism, which afterAvards turned out to be one of the brachio-cephahe artery. In addition to Dupuy- tren’s case, the operation has been done by Petrequin, Schuh, and Canton, in, all instances with a fatal result. 3. The above-mentioned difficulties are met by a plan of procedure, origi- nally suggested, I belicAO, by Pergussou, but Avhich has as yet been praetised , in only one case. It is Amputation of the Arm at the Shoxilder-joint, , followed by Distal Ligature of the Artery a despciate undei taking, tiuly,. but for a desperate disease, it must be remembered, and one that imder ordi- nary siu’gical treatment is almost incurable. The artery might be ligatured before the amj)utation. “ It is knoAvn, says FergiASSon, “ that amputation at the shoulder-joint is genei’ally a very success- ful operation ; so far as this Avound is concerned, then, there might be little to apprehend, but the effect on the timiour is not so easily foretold. Ifigaturc-LIGATURE OF THE VERTEBRAL ARTERY. 117 of the axillary artery on the face of the stump might here be reckoned like Brasdor’s operation ; yet there is a ^-ast ditfercnce, for in the latter case the same amount of blood which previously passed towards the upper extremity would still find its way down, and probably part of it would run through the sac ; whereas, were the member removed, as the same quantity would no lou<mr be required in this direction, the tumoim might possibly be much more under the control of pressure. The value of such a suggestion remains yet to be tested, however, and it would be futile to reason upon it at present. It might be a judicious ventme fii’st to tic the axillary or subclavian under the clavicle ; and then, if it were found that the aneurism stiU increased, amputa- tion might be performed, cither immediately before or after the separation of the ligatiu-e.” "Were a case of aneimism of the subclavian artery internal to the scaleni to present itself to me, the plan that I should adopt would be, first, the employ- meut of pressure ou the A’cssel at the distal side ot the tumour, if practicable ; should this not succeed, I would, if the disease were situated between or internal to the scaleui, ligature the artery in the third part of its course ; and, did that not succeed in checking the increase of the anemism, I would perform umputation at the shoulder-joint, as recommended by Fergusson. Should the uneimism occupy the artery after it has passed the scaleni, direct pressure on the sac holds out the best prospect of success. Should that fail, 1 would not .attemi^t the ligatm'c of the artery below the clavicle ; as it is an operation the result of which is most unsatisfactory, and would not prevent a large current ±hi-ough the sac for the supply of the collateral circulation of the arm ; but I would at once have recoimse to amputation at the shoulder, and then ligature the vessel as near as possible to the sac. It is true that, even in this case, the hgatm-e would be below the branches that ai’e given off under the pectoral muscles ; but, as the arm would be removed, they could not undergo any increase of activity for the supply of the collateral circulation of the upper extremity. The only case in which this operation has been performed, was by Spence in 18()4. The patient lived for four years ; and, although the anemism was not eiu’cd, the result afforded good promise of success for the futiu’e. For the £rst ton days after the operation, the tumoiu- was scarcely to be felt ; and when the patient left the hospital the tumoiu’ had diminished to one third ■of its farmer size. The artery was tied in two places—where it was cut, and als© just beyond the tumoiU’. Before the patient’s death—which probably arose from iuternal aneurism—the aneurism had increased somewhat towards the cheat. Ligature of the Vertebral Artery.—This bold and difficult operation is •only to bo found recorded in one case in the annals of Smgery—that in Avhich Smyth ©f Ifcw Orleans had rccomse to it to check regirngitant hmmorrhage after ligature of the inuominato for subclavian anemism (p. 111). I Avill give the details of the operation in the words of Smyth.—“ The head^ of the patient being throAvn back and slightly turned to the left, an incision two inches in length was made along the posterior border of the .sterno-mastoid^ muscle, commencing at the point Avhore the external jugular wem crosses this muscle and terminating a little above the clavicle; the cdo'c ofSPECIAL ANEURISMS. iiS the mnsclc being exposed and drawn to the inner side, the prominent anterior tubercle of tlic transverse process of the sixth cervical vertebra was rcadilj felt and taken for a guide. Immediately before this and in a vertical line with it lies the artery. A layer of fascia was now divided ; some loose cellular tissue with lymphatics and the ascending cervical artery were pulled to the inner side ; and a separation Avas made betAveen the scalenus anticus and longus colli muscles just bcloAv their insertion into the tubercle, Avhen the artery and vein became visible ; the latter Avas draAvn to the outer side (this is important), and the needle passed around the former fi’om Avithout inAvards.” ANEURISM OP THE AXILLARY ARTERY. This artery, though less commonly the seat of aneurism than other large vessels, such as those of the ham, the groin, and the neck, yet is sufficiently frequently diseased. This is due partly to its situation, its proximity to the shoulder-joint causing it to be subjected to the very varied, extensive, and often forcible movements, of which that articulation is the seat ; and partly to the arteiy being deficient in that support AA’hich Avould be afforded it by a strong investing sheath, such as is commonly met with in arteries of corresponding magnitude. Amongst the most frequent causes of axiUary aneurism, may be mentioned falls upon the shoulder or upon the outstretched hands, and in many cases the efforts made at reducing old standing dislocations, instances of which are recorded by PeUetan, Flaubert, Warren, and Gibson; the head of the bone in these cases haAung probably contracted adhesions to the artery, in consequence of which the vessel was torn during the efforts at reduction. Axillary, like subclaAdan aneurism, occiu’s more commonly on the right than on the left side, and is met with in especial frequency amongst men; of 37 cases, only 3 occurred in Avomcn. I am acquainted Avith one case only in AA'hich both axillary arteries became aneurismal; it occiuTcd to Fmner of Brighton. In this remarkable case both axillary arteries became affected, an interval of about fifteen months intervening between the formation of the two aneurismal tumours ; and the subclaAuan Avas ligatured on both sides successfully. Symptoms.—In axillary anemism there are three sets of symptoms, attention . to which Avill usually enable the Surgeon to recognise the disease ; these ai’o, the existence of a tumour in the axilla, the pain that it occasions, and the affections to Avhich it gives rise in the limb. The precise situation at which an aneurism of the axillary artery presents externally, will depend upon whether it springs from that lAortion of the a essel that lies aboA'e, beneath, or beloAV the lesser pectoral muscle. If from above, it Avill appear as a tumom seated immediately beloAV the clavicle and occupying the triangular space betAvecn the upper margin of the lesser pectoral and that bone ; if it be loAver down, it will raise the anterior fold of the axilla, being prevented from extending much out of this space by tbe dense fascia that stretches across from one side to the other. The tuinoui, Aihich is at firatso t and compressible, has a AA’hizzing bruit ; and its pulsations, Aidiich are cxpansi e, may be aiTcsted by pressure upon the subclavian artery, aaIicic it passes ovci the first rib. It usually increases Avith great rapidity, oAving to t ic i e resistance opposed by the loose areolar tissue in this situation, and most comANEURISM. 119 TREATMENT OF AXILLARY moiily extends downwards and forwards, causing the hollow of the axilla to disappear. In some rare instances, however, the tumour has been known to take a direction upwards under the lesser pectoral, and into the areolar interval above that musclo, or even underneath the clavicle into the acromial angle between it and the trapezius. 11 is fortunately rare for an aneurism to take such a course, as it would present serious difficulty in the compression or the ligatime of the subcla’i-ian ; and there is more than one instance on record, in which the sac has been punctured in the attempt to pass the needle round this vessel. "When the aneurism is seated high up, it not unfrequently happens that the claA'icle is pushed upwai'ds by the pressure of the tumoim beneath it a com- plication of considerable moment in reference to the operation, the difficulties of which are gi-eatly increased by it. The pressure of the tumour upon neigh- boiu’ing parts may give rise to sei’ious consequences ; thus it may produce a carious state of the first and second ribs, and the compression of the brachial plexus of nerves will occasion pain and numbness in the upper extremity. The affections of the limb occasioned by the aneiu’ism are diminution or ex- tinction of the radial pulse, oedema, coldness, and loss of muscular power. In some cases the brachial artery beyond the tumour would appear to be ob- structed, no pulsation being perceptible in it; and the compression of the axillary vein may occasion oedema of the hand and arm, with some diminution in the temperature of the limb ; and these symptoms, if the tumoim attain a very large size, may even amount to indications of impending gangrene. Diagnosis.—The diagnosis of axillary aneiudsm is usually readily made ; there being but two diseases with which it can well be confounded, viz., chronic enlargement and suppuration in the glands of the axilla, and pulsating tumour of the bones in this region. From gkmdular or other abscess, the diagnosis is generally easy; but I have seen some cases in which, pulsation being communicated to their contents by the subjacent artery, it was somewhat difficult to distinguish the nature of the tumours. Here, however, the history of the case and its speedy progvess to pointing wiU indicate its true natui’e. From medullary tumour, or osteo-aneurism of the head of the humerus, the diagnosis is not always so easy ; and there are at least two instances on record in which the subclavian artery has been ligatured for disease of this kind on the supposition of its being an aneurism. In these instances it has, howeTi'er, generally been observed that the tumoiu’ first made its appearance on the fore part of the shoulder, and not in the usual situation of axillary aneurism ; that it was from the first firm, smooth, elastic, but nearly incompressible ; and that, although it presented distinct pulsation, there was no true bellows-sound, but rather a thrilling brait perceptible in it. The most important diagnostic mark, perhiips, is the fact of these tumoims forming a prominence in situations in which aneurisms of the axillary artery would not at first show themselves, as at the upper, outer, or anterior part of the shoulder. In more advanced stages, Avhen the substance of the bone has undergone absorption and its shell has become thin and expanded by the outward pressure of the tumour, there is often a dry crackling or rustling sound perceived on pressure, which is never met with in cases of aneurism. TuEATnEXT.—I am not acquainted A\ ith any instance in wdnch an aneurismSPECIAL ANEURISMS. 120 of tlie axillai’y artery, not arising from wound or injury, has undergone spon- taneous cure, or been consolidated by constitutional treatment. Compression or ligatiu’e of the subclavian in the third part of its course is the only means of cure. Axillary aneurisms arc favourably situated for the employment of digital compremon. By this means the subclavian can easily be commanded as it passes over the first rib. And the success of this treatment is likely to be great; first, because, the sac being usually large, a considerable quantity of the contained blood is well out of the ciUTent of the circulation, readily stagnates, and may thus easily coagulate ; and secondly, because the current of blood through the sac is proportionately small, and thus if coagulation once begin, may easily be completely arrested. Digital compression, therefore, in my opinion, should always be had recom’se to in the first instance. By this means, aided by rest and constitutional treatment, the progress of the tumour may be stayed, and possibly a consolidation of its contents and ciu’e be effected. Tliis occurred at University College Hospital in a patient seventy-one years of age, in whom an axillary aneiu’ism as large as a shaddock and of an actively progressing character was cured by intermittent digital compression continued at intervals for between two and three weeks, during which time compression was kept up in all about twenty-three hours, the consolidation commencing on the third day of compression after seven hours of pressiu’e had been tried. Holmes mentions eight cases in which digital compression has been tried. Three of these, under the care of Ciniselli and Dutoit, and another Siu’geon whose name is not mentioned, were of traumatic origin, and of these two were cured. The remaining five were idiopathic. Three of these, under Cooper Forster, Peatson, and Eizzoli, were cured. Two, imder Tiuet and Vanzetti, failed. In Cooper Forster’s case the compression was applied twice under chloroform; on one occasion for three and a quarter hoiu’s and on the other for eight hom’S. In Peatson’s case the pressiue was apphed at intervals for a period of nearly three months. In Rizzoli’s case the treatment lasted even longer, the cure not being complete for nearly six months. In this case the artery was so dilated and diseased that ligature was impossible. In Dutoit’s case the compression was applied for six hours a day for six days. Compression by instruments on the cardiac side can seldom be made ap- plicable to anem’isms in this situation; inasmuch as the pressiue that is brought to bear upon the subclavian must necessarily at the same time influence the greater part of the brachial plexus of nerves to such an extent as to be unendiuable by the patient. Yet it is not impracticable, and means might be devised to overcome this difficulty. Ligatiue of the artery is, however, still the Surgeon’s chief resoiuce in the treatment of these cases. The part of the vessel universally selected foi the application of the ligatm-e is, in accordance with the Hunterian doctrines, that which lies on the first rib beyond the scalenus anticus muscle ; this part presenting the advantages of being sufficiently removed from the seat of disease to ensiue the probability of the coats of the artery being in a sound state, of being by flu the most accessible, and, when deligated, of allowing the collateral circulation by which the vitality of the arm is to be maintained to remain un- iujiued. Notwithstanding these obvious advantages presented by the ligatuicligature of the subclavian artery. I2I of the subclavian over that of the axillary artery, m other words, by performing Hunter’s instead of Aiicl’s operation for the cure of spontaneous axillaiy aneurism, there would appear to be a tendency in the minds of some Surgeons to advocate the latter instead of the former of these operations ; and to sub- stitute for one that offers the advantages that have just been mentioned a procedure that is not only much more difficult in its performance, and that interferes with the collateral circulation, but that is practised upon a diseased part of the vessel, in dangerous proximity to the sac. Ligature of the Subclavian in the Third Part of its Course.—In order to apply a ligature to that portion of the subclavian artery Avhich inter- venes between the acromial edge of the scalenus anticus and the lower border of the first rib, the patient should be placed in the recumbent position, the arm depressed as much as possible, and the liead turned somewhat to the opposite side. The integuments of the lower part of the neck should then be put on the stretch by being drawn downwards over the. clavicle, and an incision about four inches in length made upon the bone through the integument, the super- ficial fascia, and the platysma. When tension is taken off the part, this in- cision udll be found to traverse the base of the inferior triangle of the neck ; a vertical incision should then be made at right angles to, and falling into the centre of, the first, and the two flaps of integument and fascia should then be turned up. A quantity of loose areolar tissue will now be exposed, in which a A'enous plexus and the lower end of the external jugular vein will commonly be fomid. These vessels should be carefully avoided, and the areolar tissue dissected or scratched through with the point of a knife and a blunt probe ; should any vein be wounded, a double ligature must be passed underneath it, and both ends tied. If the trausversahs coUi or humeri arteries, as occasionally happens, should inconveniently traverse this place, they must be draAvii out of the way with a blunt hook. By the combined action of cutting and scratch- ing through the areolar tissue, the external edge of the scalenus anticus is reached ; this is the “ directing line ” down which the finger is run until the tubercle of the first rib is felt. This is the guide to the artery, which wiU be found immediately above and a little behind it, covered, however, and bound down to the rib by a dense fascia. This must now be very carefully opened ■with the edge of the knife, and the needle passed from before backwards. In doing this, attention must be paid to the brachial jjlexus, situated above and behind the artery (Figs. 387, 388, 389). I here are several points in connection with this operation that deserve special attention. In the first place, it is necessary that the shoulder should be depressed as far as possible, so as to bring the superior margin of the clavicle <lo^\^l. This is a matter of much importance ; for, if the clavicle be thrust upwards by the pressui’e of a large aneurism, the Surgeon will have to find the artery at the bottom of a deep narrow wound, instead of on a comparatively plain surface. A case occurred to Sir A. Cooper, in which the attempt to ligature the subclavian artery for a large aneurism of the axilla was forced to be abandoned, in consequence of the clavicle being thrust up to too great a height to enable him to reach the vessel. The extent of the difficulty occa- sioned by this elevation of the clavicle must necessarily depend in a <>-reat measure upon the height at which the subclavian artery happens in any*^par-122 HPECTAL ANEURISMS. ticular case to be sitnatcci in the-neck. It is not uncommon to find it pul- satinj;' so high in the neck, that no amount of elevation of the clavicle by a subjacent axillary aneurism could raise that bone above the level of the vessel. In the majority of cases, ho^Yevcr, (in seventeen out of twenty-five, as shoAvn by Quain in his Avork on the Arterks,) it is cither beloAv the level of the bone, or but slightly raised above it; so that, if the clavicle were thrust upAvards and fonvards, the vessel would be bimied in a deep pit behind it. Dupuy- tren Avas of opinion that the artery coiu’scd high in persons Avho AA^ere thin, Avith slender long necks; Avhereas, in thick, short-necked persons, with muscular shoulders, it Avas deeply seated. I have often verified the truth of this observation, both in dissection and in examining the pulsations of the vessel durino- life. o In order to obviate the difficulty that has occasionally been experienced in reaching the artery when thus biu’ied behind an elevated clavicle, it has been proposed by Hargrave to saw through the bone. The most serious objection Fig. 3S7.—Ligature of the Suhclavian in the Third Part of its Course. that can be raised against this practice, is the fact of the clavicle being sometimes a part of the wall of the aneurism ; but, supposing the Sm-gcon could satisfy himself that this was not the case, I cannot sec any objection to this procedure, provided any very great and insurmountable difficulty presented itself in passing the ligature round the vessel without it.

In ni, arteries examined by Qnain, it arose from the third part as a separate biaiicr in 101, or as nearly as possible one in throe cases. The external jugular vein shonld lie close to the outer edge of the s erno- mastoid; but it is frequently more extenial, and must consequently be divided in the operation between a double ligature. In passing the needle round the subclaA’ian, care must be taken that some of the lowei°cords of the brachial plexus be not included in the noose ; and indeed the mistake has more than once been committed of tying these nervous trunks instead of the vessel. Thus, Liston, in the first successful case ot ligature of the subclavian in this country, passed the thread round the lower nenmus cord ; but immediately perceiving his eiTor, turned it to account b} Fi". 3SS.—Diagram of Right Subclavian Arteiy iu the Third Part of its Course.

Dupuytren, in a case of aneurism of some years’ dmation, succeeded, after an operation that lasted one horn and forty-eight minutes, and which he describes as the most tedious and difficult he ever attempted, in passing a ligature round the vessel, as he beheved. After the death of the patient, which occurred from htemoiThage on the ninth day, the artery Avas found to have been perforated by the needle, and one half the vessel and the lower cord of the brachial plexus included in the noose. In a case related by Porter, it is stated that the artery communicated such distinct pulsation to the inferior nervous trunk, that there Avere no means of ascertaining Avhether it Avas the A'cssel or not, except by passing the needle undei’ it. In some cases, as has already been stated, the sac passes upwards beloAV the clavicle into the inferior posterior triangle of the neck ; Avhen this is the case, the Surgeon incurs the risk of puncturing it from its close proximity to the artery, as it lies on the first rib. This accident happened to Cusack Avhilc ligaturing the subclavian in the third part of its course, for a diffused aneurism of the axillary artery. An alarming gush of blood took place, Avhich AVfbs aiTcsted by plugging the Avound ; biit the haemorrhage recurred on the tenth day, and the patient died.

(124 trollablo than I liave ever witnessed,” and was not commanded by drawing ‘the ligatnre tight. It was so great that it was douljtful whether the patient Avonid leave the theatre alive, and was only arrested by plugging the wound with sponge-tents. The patient died of inflammation of the pleura. On examination, the ancnrismal sac was found to have a pouch-like enlargement np\vards, overlying the artery, where it had been punctured. In connection ■with the ligature of the subclavian in this situation it is impossible to pass O’^'er in silence the flxet, that in some instances the artery takes a remarkably high course in the neck, and that in some of those instances, instead of pass- ing over the fii’st dorsal rib, it has boon supported on a supernumerary cervical rib, the anatomical relations being thus seriously distm’bod. Anti again, if this supernumerary cervical rib be miusually short, the vessel may be found to lie between it and the fii’st dorsal. Ligature between the Scaleni.—If the sac encroach upon the neck, rising above the clavicle, or the artery be not sound in the third part of its coiu'se, it may be necessary to ligature it between the scaleni, dmding the outer half or two-thirds of the scalenus anticus. This operation should not be considered as distinct Aom ligatime of the vessel in the third part of its course, but rather as an extension of that proceeding, if it be found, for the reasons just mentioned, unadx'isable to tie the artery on the first rib ; in this way it has been practised by Dupuytren and Liston. In its first steps, as far as the exposure of the scalenus anticus, it is the same as that for the deligation of the vessel in the third part of its coui-se. When this uiuscle has been exposed, a director must be pushed under it, upon winch it is to be divided to the extent of half or two-thirds its breadth, when it retracts, exposing the vessel. During this part of the operation, some danger may be incurred to the phrenic nerve, and to the transversales colli and humeri arteries ; but if ordinary care be taken, this will not be great. The phrenic ner\*e, as I have found by very frequent examinations on the dead body, lies altogether to the tracheal side of the incision, if that be not carried beyond one-half the breadth of the muscle ; and shoidd it appear to be in the way, it may readily be pushed in- waixls towards the mesial line, being only loosely invested by areolar tissue. I have, however, seen one instance in which the right subclavian artery was ligatured for a spontaneous cyhmh’iform aneurism of the axiUa, and the patient ‘died on the eighth day, of pneumonia ; on examination after death, the edge ■of the scalenus was found cut, and the phrenic nerve divided. Had the in- jury to the nerve in this case anything to do with the pneumonia ? I do not think it improbable ; as dmsion of one phrenic nerve, by paralysing to a ‘Certam extent the diaphragm, and so far interfering unth the respiratoiy move- ments, must necessarily have a tendency to induce congestion of the lung, which would readily run on to inflammation of that organ. ^ I have likewise heard of one case in which incessant hiccough followed this operation, and nfter death the phi’enic nerve was found reddened and inflamed, having probably in some way been interfered -unth during the exposiue of the "S'CSSCl. Another important point in reference to the ligature of the x esscl in this part of its coiuse is, that in five cases out of six on the right side and in one half on the left, the superior intercostal arises from the subclavian artery125 ACCIDENTS AFTER LIGATURE OF SUBCLAVIAN. l)ct\vccn the sctilcni. this is the cfisc, there 'would piobfibly be iDut slender chiiuce of the occlusion of the firtcry by liguture in this situfvtiou. The transversalcs colli and humeri arteries, though in some • danger, whilst crossing over the scalenus anticus, may be a'\'oidcd by keeping the incision iii the muscle between and parallel to these vessels. One principal danger in ligaturing the subclavian artciy at any point above the first rib, certainly arises from interference Awth the fine areolar tissue which lies between it and the scalenus muscles, separating’ it from the pleura, and which is continuous with the areolar membrane of the anterior mediastinum, being indeed the deep portion of the ascending layer of what Sir A. Cooper has described as the- “ thoracic fascia,” and which tends to form the superior boundary of the chest, being continuous in the neck with the deep cervical fascia. After the deeper- layers of the cervical fascia have been opened, this fine areolar membrane pre- sents itself; and, if inflammation be excited in it, the morbid action will readily extend by mere continuity of tissue into the thorax by the anterior- mediastinum, invading ultimately the pleura and pericardium. Hence, when- ever it is practicable, the Singeon should keep the point of the needle close to that part of the artery which hes upon the first rib, as there is less risk here of' opening into the deep areolar tissue of the neck. Accidents following Ligature of the Su'bclavian. — The general rcsidt of the ligature of the subclavian artery in the third part of its coiu’se, for spontaneous aneurism in the axillary, is by no means satisfactory. Thus,, of forty-eight cases of aneurism of the axillary artery, not dependent upon any external wound, in which the artery was ligatmed above the clavicle, I find twenty-three cures against twenty-five deaths. This result is so unfavourable,, and so different, indeed, from what I anticipated, that I have been led to- analyse carefrdly the causes of the deaths. I find them as follows :— Inflammation -svithin the chest, &c. Suppuration of the sac . Suppurative phlebitis Hremon-hage Gangrene of hand and arm General gangrene .... Not stated .... 10 fi 1 3 1 1 3 cases. Thrw it will be seen that the tw'o most fi'cquent causes of a fatal result- follotving the operation for axillary aneurism, are not those that are usually met with after the ligature of the larger vessels. It would therefore appear to be otving to some special condition, dependent either upon the appheation of a igature to the subclavian arteiy in the third part of its coiu'se, or upon the situation and nature of the disease for which that operation is had recourse to • and the important point to be determined is, whether these conditions arc the accidental or the necessary consequences of the application of a ligature in this situation for the cm-c of aneurism in the axilla. Inflammation of lU Contents of the Thorax proved fatal in 10 out of 25 cases or in 2-1), and is the most frequent cause of death, though not, I believe thi most frequent untoward complication of this operation. It mio-ht at first bo Bupposod that, in this respect, the operations on the suboiavL „rte^.SPECIAL ANEUlilSMS. resembled other of tlic greater operations, after Avliicli pyemic pneumonia is so common a sequela ; but, on closer examination, it will be found that this is not the case. Inflammation, when attacking the tliorax or its contents after ligature of tins artery for axillary aneurism, is uot confined to the lungs, but very com- monly affects the pleura and pericardium as "well as, or c^’cn in preference to these organs. It would, therefore, appear probable that it arose from causes that are essentially connected either with this operation or with the aneurism itself. These are refen-ible to three heads. 1. Inflammation of the deep areolar tissue at the root of the neck may extend to the anterior mediastinum, the pleura, and pericardium. This would appear to ha^ e been the cause of death in a patient in whom Key tied the suh- clavian, and has been especially adverted to by that excellent Surgeon in his relation of the case. 2. The sac may, by its pressme inwards, encroach upon and give rise to inflammation of that portion of the plem’a which corresponds to its posterior aspect. This occun-ed in a case in which Mayo of Winchester operated, and is more liable to happen if suppuration have taken place in the sac ; when this occiu’S, adhesion may take place between it and the plenra, or even the tissue of the adjacent lung ; and the contents of the suppimating tumom- may be discharged into the pleural cavity or air-tubes, and so coughed up. Of this curious mode of termination there are at least two cases on record ; one hy Bnllen, in which the patient recovered ; the other by Gross, in which the patient died from the escape of the contents of the sac into the cavity of the plenra. 3. Di’^ision of the phrenic nerve would necessarily, by interfermg with the respiratory movements, induce a tendency to congestion and inflammation of the lungs ; and, although such an accident must be a very rare one in ■cases of ligatime of the subclavian for axillary aneurism, yet it imdoubtedly has occurred, as I have myself witnessed in one case. Suppuredion of the Sac is the most common, though not the most fatal, accident after ligatiu’e of the subclavian for spontaneous axillary aneurism. It xvas the immediate cause of death in six cases, and ocemved in two of the ■patients that died of inflammation of the chest; it also took place in six cases that recovered : in aU, fourteen cases out of forty-five, or nearly one in three, —a much higher proportion than is generally observed in cases of ligature for •aneiuism. What occasions this greater frequency of suppuration of the sac in axillary uneiu'isms than in those in other situations ? The only cause to wliich it appears to be attributable is the great laxity of the areolar membrane in the uxilla, which allows the tumom- to increase so rapidly in size as to excite inflammatory action in the surrounding tissues, which may speedily i-un into suppuration. So long as the contents of the tumour continue fluid, they will necessarily excite less irritation on simrounding strnctiu-cs; but when once they have beconye solidified, whether by the gradual deposition of laminated fibrine, during the progress of the disease, or more suddenly, in consequence of those changes that take place in the contents of an ancurismal sac alter the ligatm-e of the artery leading to it, the indurated mass, acting lilcc any other foreign body, sets up inflammation in the ai’colar tissue that is in127 surruiiAi'ioN of axillary aneurism. iramodiatc contact with it, and thus disposes it to run into suppuration. The more speedily the solidification takes place, the more disposition will there be to the oecurrcnce of tliis accident ; the neighboiu'ing parts being unable to accommodate themselves to the sudden c.xtension and compression they arc comixilled to undergo. It is probable also that the proximity of the ligatuie, and perhaps aetual injury done to the aneurismal sac during the operation arc, in many cases, the immediate causes of the inflammation and suppuration. The statisties collected by Koch show' a much greater mortality in those cases in wdiich the subclavian artery has been tied for spontaneous aneurisms extend- ing aboA'e the upper border of the pectoralis minor, than in those below' that po'int. Of 17 of the former 13 were fatal, of 22 of the latter only 10 died. The period at w'hich suppm’ation of the sac may be expected to occur in cases of axillary aneurism, after the ligature of the subclavian, must necessarily in a great measure be dependent on the state of the sac at the time of the operation. If inflammatory action have been already set up around it, it may happen in a few' days after the artery has been tied. But if this morbid action have not already commenced, the period at wdiich suppuration may most probably be expected is between the first and second month. The period at which suppuration and rupture of the sac take place does not influence the probable termination of the case to any material extent ; as, in the cases that proved fatal, death occurred at various periods betw'een the seventh day and the second month ; in Aston Key’s case, on the ninth day ; in Mayo’s on the twelfth ; in Belardini’s and Griife’s, at the end of the first month ; in Eigaud’s at the sixth week ; in B. Cooper’s, in the second month. The recoveries, likew'ise, took place at all periods after the ligature of the vessel, between a few days, as in Porter’s, and six weeks, as in Halton’s case. An axillary aneurism that has suppm-ated may burst either externally, or into the hmgs or pleura, or both. It is most usual for it to burst externally ; the tumour enlarges, with much pain and tension ; a part of the skin covering it becomes inflamed ; fluctuation can be here felt, and, if an incision be not made, the tumour will give way, discharging most usually a quantity of dark- colom-ed pus, mixed, up w'ith more or less broken-down and disintegrated coagulum and fibrinous deposit, and perhaps sooner or later followed by a stream of arterial blood. Occasionally, but more rarely, the sac extending backwards becomes adherent to the pleura, and may give Avay into its cavity ; or, by pressing upon the lungs, may become incorporated with them. Of this remarkable termination two instances arc recorded, in one of which recovery took place. Ihe first case of the kind, is one in which Bullen ligatured the subclavian su'tery for axillary aneurism. Eighteen days after the operation the tiuuour began to increase, and to take on the symptoms that are indicative of suppu- ration. On the twenty-sixth day six or eight ounces of bloody pus were expec- torated during a paroxysm of coughing, and the tumour suddenly diminished to one half its size; it was now punctured, and five ounces of the same kind of matter were let out with great relief. 'Wlicn the patient coughed, air passed into and distended the sac througli an aperture between the first and second ribs, near their sternal extremities, through which the contents of the tumour had escaped into the lung. The discharge from the external aperture greatlySPECIAL ANEURISMS. 128 decreased ; the cough lessened ; and finally, three months after tlic operation, the patient -was quite well. Gi’oss tied the subclavian artery for axillary aneurism on the 18th of February. After the performance of the operation the contents of the tumour | solidified, and its volume progressively diminished. On the 15th of March, the patient suffered from fever, and slight tendemess on the apex of the tumour was perceptible. On the lOth he was suddenly seized with intense ) pain in the chest, which was particularly severe at the base of the right lung, i and extended up towards the axilla. The respiration throughout the right lung was bronchial, and there was dulness on percussion over the lower ribs the aueurismal tumoiu’ had suddenly disappeared at the time of the attack. On the 18th, the patient experienced a sensation as if a fluid were passing from the pleuritic cavity into that of the ancurismal tiunour ; and, upon auscultating, a plashing sound was heard at every inspiration, the noise resem- bling that produced by shaking water in a closed vessel. On the 20th, he died. Upon dissection, the aneurism was found to communicate by an aper- ture, one inch and three-quarters in length and an inch and a half in width, nith the pleural ca-vdty; this opening was situated between the first and second ribs, and was obviously the result of idceration and absorption, caused by the pressime of the tumour. Both ribs wore denuded of their periosteum. The right side of the chest contained nearly three quarts of bloody serum, inter- mixed with laminated clots and flakes of lymph ; the former of which had exudently been lodged originally in the aneurismal sac. i Besides these cases, a somewhat similar one has been recorded by Ueret, of Nancy. A patient was admitted into the hospital, labouring under hsemoptysis, ; and on examination was found to have an aneurism of the left subclavian artery as large as a chestnut. He died shortly after admission ; and, on exami- nation, the aneurism was found to communicate with a large cavity in the upper part of the lung. The cause of death in Gross’s case was probably the fact of the sac opening- and discharging its contents into the pleiu’al cavity. This does not appear to have occurred in Bullen’s, in which a communication was estabhshed directly with the lung, the contents of the abscess finding exit through the air-tubes. The process "here was analogous to what occasionally occurs in hepatic abscess when this opens through the lungs, adhesion having previously taken place between the opposed surfaces of the pleura. In Furner’s case of axillary aneurism, both arteries became affected by the disease, and both subclavians Avere tied in the third part of their course at an interval of about fifteen months. In this most remarkable and interesting case, the result of which reflects much credit on the skill and decision of the operator, the patient, a stone-mason by trade, made an excellent recovery from the first operation. After the second operation he progressed most favourably for twelve weeks, by which time the tmnour had diminished so much as to be not more than a third of its original size. Without obvious reason febrile dis- turbance set in, the tumour enlarged again, and showed signs of suppurating. Funier noAV made a free incision into it through the pectoral muscle, ^ out 18 or 20 ounces of very offensive pus and broken-dovm coaguhun. le patient speedily recovered, the tumour disappearing entire y.129 SUPFURATION OF AXILLARY ANEURISM. The principal danger, and the most frequent cause of death after the suppu- ration of the sac, is the supervention of profuse arterial hmmoiThage. Ihis may either occur from the distal extremity of tHe artery opening into the sac, or from one of the large branches which serve to support the collateral circula- tion round the shoulder, such as the subscapular or posterior circumflex, coming- off either immediately above or below the sac, or fr-om the sac itself. When hmmoiThage does not take place after the suppimation of the sac, it must be fr-om the fortunate circumstance of the occlusion of the main trunk, where it opens into the tmnour. It can scarcely be fr’om the occlusion of the principal collateral branches : as there would, in this event, be a difficulty in the preser- vation of the vitality of the limb. It is easy to understand that, if the sac sprang fr-om the axillary, at a httle distance above the oi-ifices of the subscapu- lar and circumflex arteries, all that portion of the main trunk which inteiwencs between the tumour and these vessels might be occluded, and thus hiemorrhage be prevented on suppuration taking place ; whilst the collateral cii’culation Avould take place iminterruptedly through these vessels. If this portion of the artei-y have not been occluded by inflammatoi-y action, the safety of the patient must depend upon the accident of a coagulran or piece of laminated fibre being fixed or entangled in the mouth of the sac. This may prevent for a time the escape of arterial blood, which, on such a plug bemg loosened, may break forth with impetuosity, and either at once, or by its recurrence at intervals, carry off the patient. Another danger may be superadded in these cases on the suppm-ation of the sac and the supervention of hiemorrhage—namely, the occiuTence of inflamma- tion of the pleura, lung, and pericardimn, from the extension inwards of the morbid action going on in the sac. Secondary Hcemorrhage does not frequently occiu' in cases of Mgature of the subclavian arteiy in the third part of its eourse, except as a consequence of sup- puration of the sac. I am acquainted with two cases only in which death occun-ed from the hmmorrhage taking place from this artery at the part liga- tured. One of these happened to Liston, and the preparation is preserved in the Museum of the College of Surgeons (No. 1695). In this case, it may be seen that the artery was diseased at the point ligatimed, and that the bleeding ocemred, as usual, fr-om the distal side of the ligature. Gangrene of the Hand and Arm is but seldom met with as a sequela of the operation we are considering. This is doubtless owing to the freedom of the anastomosing circulation between the branehes of the transversales colli and humeri, and those of the subscapular, circumflex, and acromio-thoracic arteries, as well as between the superior and long thoracic and the branches of the intercostals and intei-nal mammary, by which the vitality of the limb is readily maintained. The principal risk fr-om gangrene would doubtless arise fr-om the subscapular artery being in any way occluded or implicated in the disease, as it is on the anastomoses of this vessel that the limb is mainly dependent for its supply of blood. But, at all events, this danger is small, the only case in which it appears to have g-iven rise to a fatal termination being one in whicli Collis tied the artci-y ; gangrene of the limb came on after much constitutional disturbance of a low tyi^c, v-ith rapid, weak pulse, thirsts, sweats, restlessness, and delirium. In Blizard’s case, there Avere VOL. II. K^30 SPECIAL ANEURISMS. slougiiing of the sac, and pericarditis, the gangrene being confined to two fingers : and in Brodic’s ease, it occurred in both the lower as well as in the upper extremities, and must, therefore, have proceeded from some constitu- tional cause altogether independent of the mere arrest of circulation thi’ough the subclaA'ian. Treatment of Inflamed Axillary Aneurism threatening Suppura- tion.—The case of an axillary aneurism becoming inflamed, and tlu-eatening to run into suppuration lefore the Surgeon has had an opportunity of liga- turing the subclavian artery, is one that is full of important practical con- j siderations, and that admits of little delay; for if the sac rupture, or be i opened, fatal hmmorrhage is the necessary and inevitable result. It would I obviously be impossible, in a case of spontaneous aneurism, with any fair chance of success to lay open the tumour, ton out the coagula, and ligature ■ the vessel above and IdcIow the mouth of the sac ; the coats of the artery, i being not only diseased, but still further softened by inflammation and super- vening suppiu-ation, would not be in a condition to hold a hgature. There are two other com’ses open—viz., ligato'e of the vessel, or amputation at the shoulder-joint ; and in the selection of one or other of these, the Sm’geon must be guided by the progi’ess the disease has made, the condition of the limb as to circidation and temperature, and the solidity or fluidity of the contents of the tumour. If the tumour be of moderate size and circumscribed, and the arm of a good temperatiue and not very oedematous, ligature of tlie artery may hold out a reasonable chance of success. It is true that this is but a chance : for the blood wiU, immediately after the noose is tied, be carried by the suprascapidar and posterior scapular arteries into the subscapular and circumflex, and by them into the axillary at no great distance from the mouth of the sac ; or it may enter directly into the month of the latter, if the subscapular or circumflex should chance to take them origin from the dilated portion of the vessel. Hence, the only safeguard against the supervention of hmmorrhage as soon as the sac has burst or been opened, or has discharged its contents, wiU be the occlusion by inflammatory action of that portion of the artery which intervenes between these two collateral branches and its mouth, or the accidental entangle- ment in the latter of a mass of laminated fibrine. Yet, in the circumstances as to the condition of tumour and limb that have just been mentioned, it would be but right for the Surgeon to give the patient a chance of presendng his limb. Should, however, htemorrhage occm’ on or after the discharge of the con- tents of the sac, the subclavian having previously been hgatured, what should be done ? If the bleeding be moderate, an attempt should be made to arrest it by plugging the Avound, and by the application of a compress and bandage. If it recur, or be so profuse as to threaten the hfe of the patient, Avhat course should the Surgeon then pm’sue ? Two hnes of procediuc are open to him . cither to cut thi’ough the pectoral muscles so as to lay the sac open fuUy, and ; attempt to include the bleeding orifice betAveen tAvo ligatures ; or to amputate ; at the shoulder-joint. _ _ f ! If a Siugeon Avere to undertake the fii’st of these alternatives in a case o , spontaneous aneurism, of Avhich alone Ave are uoaa^ speaking, he Avould, in all ^131 LIGATURE OF THE AXILLARY ARTERY. pi-obabilitj, find tlie part in sncli a condition as would prevent tlie possibility of bis completing the operation lie bad commenced. After laying open a large slougbing cavity, extending under tbe pectoral muscles perhaps as bigb as tbe cla^-icle, aud clearing out tbe broken-down coagula and grumous blood con- tained in it, in wbat state would be find tbe artery ? Certainly, tbe probability would bo strongly against its being in sucb a condition as to bear a ligature, even if it eould be ineluded in one. Its coats, in tbe immediate vicinity of tbe sac, could not, in accordance with wbat wo know to bo almost universally the case in spontaneous aneurisms of large size or old standing, bo expected to be in anything like a sound firm state, and would almost certainly give way under tbe pressiu-e of the noose ; or tbe vessel might have undergone fusifonn dilatation, as is very oommon in this situation, before giving rise to tbe cir- cumscribed false aueiu'ism, in which case it would be impossible to smTouud it by a ligatiu-e ; or, again, the subscapular or circumflex arteries might arise direetly from, and poim their recurrent blood into, the sac or tbe dilated arteiy, und, as they would lie in tbe midst of inflamed and sloughing tissues, no attempt at including them in a ligature could be successfully made. In sucb circumstances as these, the danger of tbe patient Avould be considerably in- creased by the imtation and inflammation that AA'ould be occasioned by laying open and searching for tbe bleeding vessel in tbe sac of an' inflamed, suppu- rating, and slougbing aneurism, and much valuable time Avould be lost in what must be a fruitless operation ; at tbe close of which it would, in all probability, become necessary to have recourse to disarticulation at tbe shoulder-joint, and "thus remove tbe whole disease at once. I should, therefore, be disposed to have recourse to disarticulation cd the shoulder-joint at once, in all cases of profuse recurrent bmmon-bage, following slougbing of tbe sac of an axillary aneiu’ism, which could not be airested by direct pressiu’e on tbe bleeding- orifice, after the subclaAflan has been tied. ^ There is another form of axiUary aneurism that requires immediate amputa- tion at the shoulder-joint, whether the subclaAdan artery ha^-e preA’iously been ligatiued or not; it is the case of difiiise anemism of the arnqjit, with threatened or actual gangrene of the limb. Ligature of the Axillary Artery.—Shoifld ligatiue of the axillai-y artery at any time be required, the vessel may be secured in two ivays, in the ^ace that intervenes between the lower margin of the clavicle and the fold of the axilla. fl. he first way is by an ineision, either straight or somewhat semilunar, parallel to and immediately below the inferior border of the clavicle ; this must be earned through the peetoral musele, and, when this is divided, some oose areolar tissue, in which the acromio-thoracic artery ramifies, is exposed. This must be seratched through eaiitiously, until the friscia coi-ering the vessels !)V ^ tbis, whieh must be done in the most careful niaiiiicr by making a small aperture in it, and then passing a grooved director under it the vein fimt eomes into view. This must be drawn doAvnwards, wheiTthe chvifV'1 ' it in the deep hollow formed by the exceedm^iy diflicult one, on account of the depth and narrowness of the wound ami the n,„sc„la:.ch.™ctc.- of it, walls, a, well as from tlm elam«^32 SPECIAL ANEURISAfS. occasioned by the mimcrous venous and arterial branches which ramify across the space in which the artery lies. After the vessel has been exposed, the passage of the ligature around it Avill bo greatly facilitated l)y bringing the arm to the side of the body, so as to take off all tension from'^the wound (Fig. 8!)0). ffhe safer and simpler operation consists in making an incision from the centre of the clavicle directly downwards, in the course of the vessels, to the middle of the anterior fold of the axilla. In this way the skin, superficial fascia, and greater pectoral muscle, must be successively divided. The lesser pectoral w'ill then be exposed ; and the artery may either be ligatured below this, 'without fimther division of muscular substance, or if it be thought desir- able to deligate it under this, the muscle must be cautiously cut through.

The great pectoral muscle- is cut across. "When this is done, a very distinct and firm fascia will come into view ; this being pushed up, must be carefully opened, when the artery and vein will be- seen lying parallel to one another, the artery not being overlapped by the vein, as it is higher up. The -i'ein having been drawn inwards, the aneimism- needle must be carried from above downwards between it and the arteiy. The gTeat advantage of this operation is, that the woimd is open and free, and that, consequently, the artery can be more readily reached in any part of its- course. The disadvantage is the great di-vision of muscular substance that it entails. Thig, however, need not leave any permanent weakness of the hmb, as by proper position ready and direct union may be effected between the parts. The axillary artery may also be ligatured at any point below the lower border of the pectorahs minor, by making an incision parallel to its coimse in the axilla. The guiding point for the vessel in this situation is obtained by dividing the space between the anterior and posterior folds of the axilla into three equal parts, when the artery wiU be found to lie at the junction of the anterior with the middle third. The arm being held at a right angle to the trunk, so as to make the skin tense, an incision is made, commencing at the thoracic border of the axilla and extending for a distance of about three inches parallel to the course of the artery. The incision must be made so as to dmde the skin only. The fascia being exposed, must be carefully opened, when the axillary vein will come into view, and must be drawn on one side with a bhuit hook. The arteiy will now be seen suiToimded by the nerves of the brachial plexus. Ill front of it or to its inner side is the internal cutanqous. To its inner side are the uhiar and the nerve of Wrisberg.

The nerves arc easily held aside, and the ligature is passed round the artery. If the ligatimc be applied near the termination of the axillary artery, as it lies over the tendons of the latissimus dorsi and teres major, it will not be in immediate contiguity to any large branch.^ Above this point, it must be applied close to either the subscapular or the circumflex arteries, which would perhaps somewhat add to the danger of secondary luemonfliage. The operation is one which can veiy rarely be necessary in the treatment of aneurism. ANEURISM OP THE ARM, FOREARM, AND HAND. • Spontaneous aneurism rai’cly occiu's below the axilla, yet it may occasionally be met with at any part of the upper extremity. Thus Palletta, Flajani, Pelletau, and others, relate cases of spontaneous aneurism at the bend of the firm ; and Liston states that he once tied the brachial artery in an old ship- caiiienter, who, whilst at work, felt as if something had snapt in his arm. Pilcher has recorded a case of aneurism under the ball of the right thumb, which was produced by repeated though shght blows with the handle of a hammer used by the patient (a working goldsmith) in his trade ; the radial and ulnar arteries were tied immediately above the wist, and the disease was thus cimed. Aneurism has also been met with in this situation after attempted reduction of a dislocation of the thumb. In the Museum of the College of Siu’geous there is a preparation of a radial artery Avith a small aneurism, about the third of an inch in diameter, formed by the dilatation of all the coats of a narrow portion of one-half the circumference of the vessel, a little above the origin of the superficiahs volte. Spontaneous aneinism in the forearm is of extremely rare occurrence. A case has been reported by Todd as occumng in a woman twenty-eight years of age, in which a spontaneous aneurism in the forearm had existed for several years before the brachial Avas ligatmed, AA'hen pulsation in the tumour ceased, though it continued solid and hard for some months after the operation. De Morgan has recorded a case of spontaneous aneinism of the ulnar, and Spanton one of the radial aidery. In neither case Avas any operation performed. In 184!), a man Avas admitted into University College Hospital, for a tumom’ that presented all the characters of anem’ism, situated in the upper third of the ulnar artery of the right forearm. The brachial Avas liga- tined by Arnott, Avhen pulsation and bruit ceased in the tumom, though shght enlargement of the arm continued for some time afterivards. In most of the cases in Avhich the brachial artery and its primary branches have been the seat of spontaneous aneurism, disease of the heart and of the ai’tcrial system in other parts has co-existed. While spontaneous aneurisms are rare in these situations, the traumatic forms of the disease are, as has already been stated (Vol. I., pp. 32(;, 327), of more frecpient occurrence, and may require the ligature of the brachial, or of either of the arteries of the forearm. I-iihArAiExr. Ill cases of aneurism beloAv the axilla, direct pressmo may be tried with advantage, provided the tumour be of small size and unattended by inflammation of tlic superjacent integuments. Compression of the trunk of the artery above the tumour is rarely applicable, on account of the pain thatSPECIAL ANEURISMS. 134 is indiiccd bj tlic pressiu’c upon the neig'hl)ourin" nerves, Avhich cannot he isolated from the artery. Besides this, the brachial artery is so mobile, and the humerus so small and round a bone, that the vessel cannot be steadily compressed against it for any length of time, but will roll away from under the pressure, even if the patient could bear the pain of it. Iiigature of the Brachial Artery.—The brachial artery may be ligatured in the mMclle of the arm, which is considered the seat of election of this opera- tion, by making an incision, about three inches long, parallel to and upon the inner edge of the biceps, which is the “ directing line ; ” the fascia, which is exposed, must be opened carefully to a corresponding extent, when the median nerve will commonly be seen crossing the wound ; tliis must be drawn dovm- wards with a blunt hook, when the artery, accompanied by its two veins, will be exposed ; these vessels must then be separated from one another, and the ligatiu’C passed and tied in the usual rvay. In perfomring this operation, the priircipal point to atteird to is to cut dorvn upon the inner edge of the biceps, which will be the sure guide to the artery (Big. 391). If the Surgeon keep too low, he may faU rrporr the rrhrar rrerve and the iirferior profrrnda artery, which might possibly be mistaken for an abrrormaUy small brachial; by taking care j to expose the fibres of the biceps in his early incision, he will avoid this error. Iir the iipper 2Kirt of the arm, the brachial artery, where the axillary ter-mi- i nates in it, wiU be formd lyirrg immediately bchirrd and covered by its vein. On drawing this to the inner side, the artery will be seen, surrourrded by nerves. It has irr frorrt the irrrrer cutaneous ; the rrlnar arrd rrerve of Wrlsberg' j ' to the irrrrer side ; behirrd, the mrrsculo-spiral; and on the outer side, the • | median.

B} rotating the arm outwards and bending the elborv, the arteiy will be thiovn forward and rendered less tense, so that a ligature can easily be passed round it. At the lend of the arm, the brachial artery may be reached by making an incision, about two inches in length, in a direction downwards and orrtvar s, about half an inch internal to the edge of the tendon of the biceps, paral e135 LIGATURE OF RADIAL AND ULNAR ARTERIES. to the median basilic vein. As soon as the integumental structures ai-e divided, the strong process of fascia from the tendon of the biceps will come into view, beneath Avhich the artery lies accompanied by its veins, in the triangulai- space bounded externally by the biceps tendon, and internally by the pronator teres. In performing this operation, the veins at the bend of the arm, with the filaments of the internal cutaneous neiwe, must be di\dded to some extent, though they should be spared as much as possible. The artery Avill be found about half an inch to the inner side of the tendon, accompanied by the median nerve, Avhich is to its ulnar side (Fig. 392). Ligature of the Radial and Ulnar Arteries.—These arteries should never be ligatured above the middle third of the arm, except in cases of direct Avound. Any attempt at tying them in the upper part of the fore- arm Avill not only be attended Avith great difiiculty, but Avith the danger of cripph'ng the muscles in this situation, and thus impairing the after-move- ments of the arm. Ligature of the brachial artery may ahvays be substituted advantageously. The Ulnar Artery above the Avrist may be readily ligatured by making an incision about two inches in length, a little above and one-third of an inch to the radial side of the pisiform bone, parallel to the tendon of the flexor carpi iflnaris, Avhich is the “ directing line ” to the vessel. After the fascia covering it has been diAuded, the artery, Avith its two accompanying veins, Avill be found to the radial side of the ulnar nerve (Fig. 393). The Radial Artery may be ligatured near the Aviist, by making an incision, about two inches in length, half an inch to the outside of the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis—the “ directing fine ” (Fig. 394); when, after the division Fig. 393.—Diagram of Left Ulnar Artery at wn.st.

CHAPTER XLV. —♦— ANEURISMS OP THE ABDOMEN AND LOM^ER EXTREMITIES. ANEURISM OP THE ABDOMINAL AORTA AND ITS BRANCHES. As until recently any surgical treatment of these anemisms was considered impossible, they were formerly left entirely in the hands of the physician; but since the introduction of compression of the aorta under prolonged anaes- thesia, by Minray of Newcastle, they have become fairly entitled to a place in a work on Surgery. Aneurism may affect the abdominal aorta at any part of its course, hut the most common situation is near the origin of the coehac axis; and here the disease is frequently not confined to the main trunk, but one or more of the branches are also affected. The next most frequent situation is at or near the bifm’cation. Aneurisms may also form in connection with any of the main branches of the abdominal aorta, most frequently on the superior mesenteric, splenic, and inferior mesenteric. The aneurism may be sacculated or tubular. When growing fium the main trunk, it is most frequently of the former variety. Symptoits.—The chief sign of the disease is the existence of a pulsating tumom, situated in or near the middle line, somewhere between the costal margin and the region of the umbilicus. The pulsation of the tumour is of the expansile kind characteristic of aneinism, and there is frequently a distinct bruit. Walshe mentions a single systolic miumm*, a dull muffled systohc sound convertible into a mm’miu’ by a little pressme, a sharp, abrupt, short systohc mm’miu’ at the left lumbar spine, a systohc minmur audible below the sac, but not over it, and occasionahy a dull second sound, as having been heard in various cases of abdominal aneurism. The exact shape and size of the tumom and the nature of its pulsation can in many cases only be ascertained by fuhy relaxing the abdommal muscles by the use of chloroform. The sen- sation of pulsation in the epigastrium may be very perceptible to the patient, or may be entirely absent. Constant aching lumbar pain is a very frequent symptom. The pressme-signs are not usuahy very marked tiU late m the disease. Pressure on the vena cava to such an extent as to cause oedema of the lower extremities is almost unknown. The sac may press on the plexus, and give rise to signs of irritation in the comse of its branches. The most marked of these are pains in the groin and testicles from irritation of the genito-crural, and occasionally shooting pains down the thigh, in the course of t e anterior cinral or external cutaneous nerve. When the bodies of the vertebral137 COMPriESSIO^"' OF THE ABDOMINAL AORTA. are eroded, constant lumbar pain will bo frequently present, ot tbe same burn- ino-, boring cluiracter as that felt in thoracic aneurism under similar circum- stinices. In some cases the pressure may aflect the groat intestine, causing considerable ditficulty in defmeation. Occasionally the tumour may attain to an enormous size before death, half filling the cavity ot the abdomen, ihe fatal tennination may bo duo to gi’adual exhaustion from pain and inteifeience with the functions of the abdominal viscera, to sudden rupture of the sac into the peritoneum or subporitoneal tissue, or into some part of the alimentaiy canal, or, more rarely, into the pleural cavity through tlie diaphragm. The Diagxosis rests chiefly on the situation of the tumour, its distinct expansile pulsation, the existence of an aneurismal bruit, and the pressure- signs. Very marlcpcl epiijcisirii' pulsaiion is not an unfrequent symptom in anmmic patients suffering from atonic dyspepsia, and in these cases very slight pressiu'e on the artery fr'om a stethoscope will give rise to a distinct bruit. Vnder these circumstances, it is sometimes not easy to speak positively as to the condition of the artery, but in the vast majority of cases a careful exami- nation under the influence of chloroform will readily determine the nature of the disease. A displaced or enlarged heart also gives rise to distinct epigastric pulsation, but this can hardly be mistaken for aneiuism. A solid mass of fieces accumulated in the. transverse colon may receive a very distinct impulse from the aorta, but the doughy feel of the mass, its superficial nature, and the history of the case, wiU usually readily determine its nature. A prominent lumbar vertebra pushing the aorta forward may also simulate a dilatation of the artery. Cancerous lumbar glands siurounding the artery may give rise to considerable difficulty in diagnosis; and here again a careful examination under chloroform is the most likely means of arrmng at a correct conclusion. Can- cerous tumours growing from the bones may give rise to almost insuperable diffieulties in the diagnosis. From tumours of the various abdominal viscera, the diagnosis must be made on general principles. The amount of fat in the abdominal walls necessarily has a great influence on the difficulty or ease of coming to a definite conclusion. Treatmext.—In aU cases of aneurism of the abdominal aorta, constitutional treatment should be given a fair trial before any more severe measiues are adopted. TufneU has recorded two cases in Avhich a erne Avas effected by diet and rest—in one case in 21 days, and in the other in 37. If this ti'eatment fail, the only resoiuce left is compression of the abdominal aorta. The pain of this application is usually very severe, so that, in order to relicA’e it, patients should be kept under the influence of chloroform for many horns. Ihe credit of introducing this mode of treatment is undoubtedly due to MuiTay of NeAvcastle-on-Tyne. The operation has noAV been performed for aortic aneurism in eight cases. In six, under J\Iurray, Durham and iloxou. Dm ham, Greenhow and Hulke, Pollock, and Sir James Paget, the pressure Avas applied on the proximal side of the sac. Of these, three—Murray’s, Durham and i\Ioxon s, and GreenhoAV and Hulke’s—Avere successful ; one, Pollock’s, failed ; and two, Durham’s second case, and Sir James Paget’s, AA'ere fatal. In tAvo the pressure was applied on the distal side of the sac ; one, under Bryant, teiminatcd fatally, and the other, under Marshall, failed. In every case the pressure has been applied by the instrmnent knoAvn in this country as Lister’s13S SPECIAL ANEUPdSMS. aortic tonrniqnct. That this instrument may be safely applied to the abdo- minal aorta from the highest point at which the artery can be reached to its bifurcation, is clearly proved by results of the cases above mentioned. In Durham and Moxon’s case, it is stated that “ by positioning the body of the patient, just sufficient space was afforded for the introduction of the pad of the tourniquet between the catilages of the ribs and the aneurism.” In Greenhow and Hulke’s case it was applied midway between the xiphoid cartilage and the umbilicus, immediately above the tumour. That three out of the eight cases have terminated fatally shows, however, that the operation is by no means devoid of danger. In Pollock’s unsuccessful case the patient suffered from hasmaturia, and in Greenhow’s case albumen appeared in the urine after the last operation, thus showing serious interference with the circulation in the kidney. In Marshall’s case the patient suffered from retention of mine for some days after one operation, probably from some injury to the hypogastric plexus. In Bryant’s case the post mortem examination showed bruising of the mesenteiy and intestine and peritonitis, and “ the tissues about the compressed aorta were loaded with effused blood.” In Paget’s case an abscess had formed in the mesentery, peritonitis had been set up, and the mesenteric artery was found to be compressed and flattened, and embolic clots were found in its branches. In Durham’s fatal case there were signs of bruising about the pan- creas, and the anemnsm was found to affect the mesenteric artery. The time diu’ing which the pressiue has been maintained has varied considerably. Mm.’- ray’s case was cm-ed by one appheation lasting five hours; Durham and Moxon’s in lOj hours ; Greenhow and Hulke’s, by three applications, lasting 55 minutes, 4 hours, and 3 hours. In Marshall’s case distal pressure was applied without serious consequences, on one occasion for 18 hoius, and on another for ID hours. Vomiting has been found to be a troublesome complication in several cases. Of the successful cases, Murray’s is the only one in which the pulsation of the tumour ceased permanently immediately after the operation. In Green- how and Hidke’s case it did not finally disappear tiU some days after the last appheation of the toiuniquet; and in Diuham and Moxon’s, although it ceased at the time, it retimied in a few horn’s, and persisted for a month before it finally disappeared. From the above cases, it vdll be seen that there is abundant evidence of the safety of the proximal operation, and sufficient probability of success to justify us in adopting it in every favoiuable case. Fiuther evidence is required before abandoning distal pressiue as absolutely useless. In Bi’yant s fatal case the sac was found to be filled Avith firm clot, which Avas considered to have been sufficient, had the patient lived, to have cured the aneurism. In Marshall’s case the tumoiu was thought to be slightly more solid after the operations, but no permanent effect was produced. The distal operation, hoAv- ever, does not seem a very hopeful one. The number and size of the branches coming off from the aorta at its upper part, and the frequency Avith Avhich the cocliac axis and its large branches are implicated, are very unfavoiuable circmn- stances for distal pressure. The anastomosis of the collateral vessels is, more- over, so small compared to the immense interference with the direct ciicu ation, that the only effect of distal pressiue must be for many hoius greatly to increase the tension in the vessels above. Ill performuig the operation of compression of the aorta under pro-139 INGUINAL ANEURISM. lon-cd anaBSthesia, a few points require special attention. The patient should he fed well on the day before the operation. On the day of the operation he should receive fluid nourishment only, and the boAvels should be we emptied by means of a copious enema. The tourniquet must be applied with the greatest care immediately above the tumour, and mth no more force than is absolutely necessary. If much force be required before the pulsation in the femoral arteries is an-ested, it is probable that the pad ot the tourniquet is not in the right place, and various attempts must be made till the spot is found where the smaUest amount of pressure will control the circu- lation. It will be found convenient to insert a soft hollow sponge under the pad of the tourniquet, as it then accommodates itself more readily to the parts between it and the spine. During the operation the patient must be watched A'erj' carefully, and the tourniquet slackened at once if any symptoms of faint- ness intervene. Obstinate vomiting may render the continuance of the opera- tion impossible. It is difficult to say whether this is due to pressme on the sympathetic or to the influence of the ctloroform. During the application of the toiu'iiiquet, it is advisable to have the lower limbs raised in the bed and warmly wrapped in cotton-wool, as marked coldness and serious congestion ha^-e usually been noticed after the compression has lasted a short time. If necessary, nutritive enemata and brandy may be administered dining the amesthesia. INGUINAL ANEUBISM. An Iliac or Inguinal Aneurism may arise from the external iliac, or from the common femoral artery ; most frequently it springs from the latter, and, taking a direction upwards, pushes the peritoneum before it, and thus encroaches somewhat upon the cavity of the abdomen. The aneurism is commonly of the circumscribed false variety, though sometimes tubular. It rarely, if ever, becomes diffused, for the reason long ago pointed out by Scarpa, that the femoral artery, above the edge of the sartorius muscle, is invested by so dense a sheath, and is so closely bound domi to the neigh- bouring fascia, that, when dilated into an aneurism, it does not readily give way. SvBirPTOMS.—When first noticed, the aneurism is a small, soft, compressible tumour, with pulsation and bruit, and is generally attended by little pain or uneasiness. It rapidly enlarges, however, and may attain a considerable mag- nitude ; being often somewhat lobulated upon the siuface, owing to the unequal constriction exercised on it by the faseije under which it lies. At the same time, it usually becomes more sohd ; and the pulsation in it diminishes con- siderably, or even ceases entirely. As it increases in size, it compresses the saphena and femoral veins, thus giving rise to oedema of the limb ; and, by stretching the genito-criual and some of the branches of the anterior crmal neiTC, it occasions considerable pain in the thigh and leg. Diagnosis.—The diagnosis of inguinal aneurism is not always so easy as might at first appear. It has most fr-equently been confounded with abscess in the groin, ivith carcinomatous tumours in this situation, and with osteo- aneurism. The diagnosis from alsccss must be made on general principles ; but in some instances it appears to be replete with difficulty, as there are not a few cases on record in which aneurisms in this situation have been mistaken140 SPECIAL AN-EUniSMS. and punctured for abscesses, an error that has three times fallen under my own observation, and one Avhicli has in every instance prov'ed fatal. The diagnosis of an inguinal aneurism, solidified by tlie deposition of laminated fibrine, and pulsating but indistinctl}^ from piilsating encejjhaloul ov osseous tumour in the groin, is surrounded by the greatest difficulty, and cannot, I bclieA’e, with the means we at present possess, be accomplished with absolute certainty. The fact of the two diseases having in two instances been confounded by two of the most distinguished Surgeons of the day, Stanley and Syme, is sufficient evidence of the difficulty attending their diagnosis. Treatjient.—It occasionally happens that inguinal anem-isms, even of a very large size, undergo spontaneous ciu’e, or become consolidated by dii-ect pressure conjoined with constitutional treatment; but these instances are of such rare occm’rence, that such a result caimot be relied on in any one case. Compression of the aorta under prolonged anresthesia has of late years been found so successful, that in no case should a trial of it be omitted when possible (see p. 137). Should it fail, it becomes necessary to tie the vessel leading to the sac. In the majority of instances the tumour, though it may have encroached on the abdomen, AviU not have reached too high for the external iliac to be ligatiued ; should it have done so, however, the Sm’geou may have to tie the common ihac ai’tery ; but in some instances even this may not be practicable, and his choice must lie between the slender chance offered by constitutional treatment, and the fearfid alternative of ligatming the aorta. Ligature of the External Iliac Artery.—There are two modes of tying the external iliac artery—the one originally practised by Abernethy, somewhat modified by Liston ; and the other introduced by Sir A. Cooper. Ahernetliy’s modified operation (Fig. 395), on the right side, consists in com- mencing an incision at a point rather more than Lvo finger-breadths to the inner side of and ^ little aboA'C the anterior superior spme of the ilium, carrying it in a somcAvhat curA'cd direction, with the convexity of the emwe ouLvards and the concaAnty looking towards the middle line, to a point that is as nearly as pos- sible opposite to, but about an inch or an inch and a half above, the middle of Poupart’s ligament. When the operation is on the left side, the incision should be begun below, and canded upwards between the two points indicated. It is about four inches in length, and, if necessary in fat subjects, may be extended at the upper end. After dividing the ^n and superficial fascia, the fibres of the external oblique tendon are carefully cut through. The internal oblique and the transA'ersalis muscles are then dh’ided AAuth great caution, Avhen the trans- A’ersalis fascia is reached, AAffiich is recognised by its dull yelloAvish-AAhite appear- ance. A small portion of this membrane, at the loAver angle of the wound, Avhere it is thimied and expanded for the passage of the spermatic cord, is iioaa care- fidly raised Avith the forceps, and cut through Avith the blade of the scalpel laid flat. A broad hernia-director is then introduced, and passed underneath it, Avhen it should be laid open upAvards and outAvards to the lull extent of the woiuid. The whole of the inner side of the wound is next drawn towards the mesial line, the peritoneum being gently separated from its loose areohu connections in the iliac fossa by the Surgeon’s fingers ; it must be kept out of the way by an assistant, who holds it up with a broad bent copper spatula or a butter-pa . The opening of the transversalis fascia is the most critical pint of the operation;LIGATURE OF EXTERNAL ILIAC ARIERl. 141 but if done in the my u-liich I have dosovibed, and at the lower angle of the may bo safely accomplished. The artery may now be felt pulsating Tig. 395.—Ligature of the Extenial Iliac by Abemethy’s Operation, modified. at the bottom of the -woniid, coyered by a thin fascia and having the vein lying to its inner side, and somewhat behind it. The investing areolar tissue must be scratched through, and the needle passed from the inner side between the vessels, the ligature being then tied in the usual way. In Sir A. Cooper's operation, an incision about three inches in length is made a little above and nearly parallel to Poupart’s ligament, begimiing above the inner margin of the external abdominal ring, and ending neai- the anterior superior spine of the ilium. By this incision the tendon of the external oblique is exposed, and must be divided to the full extent of the external wound, when the spermatic cord will be seen passing under the lower edge of the internal oblique and transversalis muscles. Some loose ai'eolar tissue and fascia have now to be scratched through ; and the finger, being passed under the cord, will come into contact with the external iliac artery, close to the spot where the epigastric is given off from it; the upper side of the incision must now be well raised by a copper spatula, when the vessel Avill be exposed, covered by an areolar sheath and having the vein to its inner side ; the sheath must be cau- tiously opened, and the ligature passed fr’om within outwards. On comparing the two operations, it would appear that the principal dis- advantage of Abemethy’s is, that it is apt to leaA’e a tendency to hernial pro- trasion, in consequence of the abdominal wall being much weakened by the142 SPECIAL ANEURISMS. Iroe incisions througli the muscular pianos that arc necessary ; the gToat ad\-antao-e attending- it is, that the external iliac may be ligatured at any part of its course, and that, if requisite, the incision may be extended upwards, und the common trunk secured. In Sir A. Cooper’s operation, the line of incision lies directly across the com-se of the epigastric arteiy, which, as well cis the ciicumflex ilii, if it arise high, and the circumflex vein, which ci’osses the iliac artery at this point, and is often somewhat tunnel-shaped, may be in dan^mr of being wounded. The spermatic cord is likewise somewhat in the way in this operation. Dupuytren actually wounded the epigastric artery in one case ; mid Houston had much difficulty from the circumflex vein in another instance! This operation had also the disadvantage, that by it it is impossible to prolong the incision upwards so as to deUgate any portion of the vessel except that which lies immediately above the crural arch ; but the peritoneum is less dis- tm’bed than in the other case, and there is less tendency to hernial protrusion afterwards. As a general rule, I think we may conclude that, in cases of spon- taneous anem'ism, in which it might, from the size of the tumom- or the diseased ■state of the vessels, be found necessaiy to apply the ligature to a higher point than was intended before the operation commenced, it will be safer to have xecourse to Abernethy’s plan, modified as above described, as in this way we •shall be able to ligature the vessel at any part of its course ; whilst in cases of ha3morrhage after amputation, or of traumatic femoral aneurism, in which the urteiy is not likely to be diseased, recourse should bo had to Cooper’s operation, more particularly if the patient be thin, and the abdomen flat. In comiection with the ligature of the external iliac artery, there are some practical points that deserve mention. Before the operation, the colon should be emptied by means of an enema, and the pubes shaved. The incision in the abdominal wall must be sufficiently extensive ; but, at the same time, it must not be carried too far forwards at its lower angle, lest it implicate the epigastric vessels. These may be roughly stated to lie at first nearly parallel to the course of the external iliac, but soon turn inwards. It shoidd of comse never be allowed to implicate the external ring, lest it give rise to a tendency to hernial protrusion. Care should be taken not to wound the peritoneum ; for, although two patients in whom this was done by Post and Tait both recovered, yet it is of coiu’se a dangerous accident, and should if possible be avoided. The peri- toneum must not be torn up more than is absolutely necessary, lest htemor- rhage or subsequent peritonitis occin ; and especial care must be taken that the fascia transversahs be properly divided, otherwise the iliac fascia may be stripped up vdth the peritoneum, and the artery in this way dragged out of its normal situation into the upper and inner angle of the wound, occasioning gTcat embarrassment to the operator, who may not be able to find it. The separation of the peritoneum is much facihtated by the Sm'geon holding the outer cut edge of the transversahs fascia tightly in his forceps with one hand, whilst he gently raises the bag of the serous membrane udth the other out of the iliac fossa, and separates its areolar connections there. All this must be done with the utmost gentleness and care. Before attempting to pass a hgaturc loiuid the vessel, the thin fascia covering it must be scratched through; and the areolar connections with the vein, which arc very thin and loose, must be sepai’ated by means of a director, or the end of the aneiu’ism-ncedlc. Ihc143 RESULTS OF LIGATURE OF EXTERNAL ILIAC. arteiy must be well cleared, and especial care taken that the genital branch of the genito-criiral nerve is not included in the noose. It is better not to use the knife deep in the wound ; and, lastly, the sac, if it extend high, must not be weakened by having its peritoneal covering stripped off. Results.—Ligature of the external iliac arteiy was first practised by Aber- nethy in 179(>. Dm-ing the following fifty years it was done in at least 100 recorded instances for inguinal aneurism (Norris); of these, seventy-three were cm-ed, and twenty-seven died. In one remarkable case, both external iliacs were ligatured successfully at an interval of eleven months, by Tait. In some few cases also, there was the complication of an aneurism in the ham with that in the gi-oin. Of ninety-two cases in which the aneurism was solely seated in the groin, seventy were cured and twenty-two died. Death resulted from gan- grene of the limb in eight, from secondary hiemorrhage in four, from sloughing of the sac in three, fr’om tetanus in three, and fr’om causes of a more general character in foiu' cases. Pulsation returned in the sac in six cases ; in some not until several weeks had elapsed after the operation; and in one instance only was this phenomenon followed by death. Siqjpuration of the sac was of frequent occmTcnce, happening in thirteen in- stances, doubtless owing to the large size that these tumom’s are often allowed to attain before being subjected to sm-gical interference. It is remark- able, however, that in three cases only was this accident fatal; and in two of these tkree instances the sac had been 0}>ened before the operation, on the supposition of its being an abscess. Secondary hccmmrhage occmxed but in six cases, foiu- of which proved fatal; a very small proportion when com- pared with what happens in other situations. This must doubtless be attributed in a great measure to the absence of any collateral branches springing from the trunk of the external iliac ; the distance between the point ligatured and the epigastric and circumflex ilii arteries affording abundant space for the safe obliteration of the vessel. In one of the fatal cases, pulsation had previously retiumed in the sac; in the other three the patients died on the seventeenth, the twenty-seventh, and the forty- third days respectively. Ganyrene of the limb is the most common cause of death after deligation of this vessel. It occuiTed m nine instances, of which eight proved fatal • one being cm-ed by amputation. The period at which the mortification supervened varied fr-om the third to the fourth week. The principal cause of this gangrene is narrowing or obliteration of the neighbouring venous trunk Iw piessuie of the tumour. In the accompanying woodcut (Fi<r <-1 ™u Illustrated; the vciu opposite the aueimsm being compieMy cteil “SPECIAL ANEUPiISMS. 144 It is a very remarkable circumstance in the liistory of tliis operation, that lour deaths resulted from tetanus. This sequence of this particular opera- tion it is difficult to account for, as it is a most unusual occurrence after the ligature of arteries, and is equally rare after wounds of the abdominal Avail in other operations, as for hernia. The only probable explanation that offers itself is that in these cases the genito-crural nerve, or its genital branch, may ha\-e been unduly irritated by or implicated in the ligature. The ligature of the external iliac for aneurismal varix in the (jrom affords a striking contrast Avith that for spontaneous aneurism ; the four cases recorded all proving fatal, tAvo dying of gangrene, and tAvo of hsemon-hage. In these cases Guthrie has recommended that the tumour should be laid open, and the artery ligatured above and beloAv the aperture in it. During the operation the artery may be readily commanded above the seat of disease by the application of the abdominal toiumiquet, either to the aorta or to the common iliac at the brim of the pelvis. Aneiu’ism occasionally takes place in the groin and ham of the same side; here the ligature of the external iliac Avill cime both diseases. Of four cases in Avhich this complication occurred, the operation Avas successful in three ; one patient dying of gangTene, and in him the popliteal aneurism Avas on the point of bursting at the time of the operation. In tAvo of the thi-ee cases that re- covered, pulsation returned in the inguinal aneurism, but disappeared after a time. Ligature of the Common Iliac.—This artery Avas first tied by Gibson, in a case of gun-shot injury, the patient dying of peritonitis and secondary hEemorrhage on the thirteenth day. The great American Surgeon, Mott, AA'as the first Avho tied it for aneurism, the patient making a good recovery. If the aneiu’ism in the groin extend so high that there is not sufficient space for the exposure and ligature of the external iliac artery, it becomes necessary to tie the common trunk. This may be done by extending the incision that serves for the ligature of the external iliac upAvards and slightly iuAvards toAvards the umbiheus, to an extent corresponding to the degree of obesity of the patient, so that it assumes a someAvhat semilunar form. Or a semilunar incision may be made fr’om the end of the last rib on a point about tAA'o or three inches above the mn- biheus, and carried doAVUAA^ards and iuAvards to a corresponding extent beloAV it. The incision is then successively carried through the different planes of muscular fibre AAith great caution and on a grooved director, until the transversalis fascia is exposed ; this must be carefully opened and fr’eely divided, so as to expose the peritoneum, Avhich noAv comes bulging into the Avound, pressing foi’AA'ard AA'ith its contents. This must be held aside, draAvn upAvards by the fingers of an assistant, and gently stripped from the iliac fossa by the Surgeon carefully insmuating his hand beneath it. When he arrives at tlie brim of the pelvis, he Avill readily be conducted to the external iliac arteiy, Avhich guides him to the parent trunk. The ligature must then be passed round the artery fr-om Avithin outAvards, a slight scratch haAdng been made through the fiiscia cover- ing the vessel by means of the finger-nail, by AAffiich it may also be sepai'atcd from the accompanying vein. In planning the incision for the ligature of this arteiy, care should be taken that it be not carried too Ioav doAvn or too far foi’Avards ; nothing can be gainedLIGATURE OF COmiOX ILIAC ARTERY. 145 l)y sOj tiiicl tliGrc is Ijcsiclcs tlio ixclclifcionul lisIc of tlic ciicuniflGX ilii 01 cpi^nstric bGin^ "WOunclGcl^ <xs Ixfippciiccl to I\'Iott ^ cind.^ cis tliGSG ciic tlxG piiii- cipiil {igGTits in tliG {xnfistouiosinj^ cii’culfition, tlioir iiijuiy is Ji sciious ciccidGiit. Shonlcfany muscular branches bleccl, they had better be ligatured, so as not to obscure the after-steps of the operation. The fascia transversalis should be opened at the lower part of the wound, where it is thinned for the passage of the spermatic cord, by pinching up a portion of it with the forceps, and dividing it carefully with the edge of the knife laid horizontally ; it will bo found to be much thicker and denser at the upper and outer part of the wound than in this situation. ‘\Mien the peritoneum is well draxvn upwards to the mesial line by the assistant’s fingers or by copper spatulae, the ureter, w^hich crosses the artery in this situation, will be carried up with it, so as not to be seen at all. In this stage of the operation, the patient should be turned on his sound side, in order to prevent the intestines from falling over and pressing the peritoneum into the wound. The vein usually comes into view ; sometimes tm-gid and overlapping the arteiy. The veins on the two sides differ in their relation to the arteries. On the right side the vein is at first beneath, and then to the outer side. The left vein lies to the inner side of the left artery, and then passes beneath the right common iliac artery to join the right vein. By means of the finger-nail and the blunt end of the aneiuism-needle, the vein may be gently separated from the artery to an extent sufficient for the passage of the ligatiue. In determining the length of the incision, and calculating the point at which he would expect to meet with and hgatiue the artery, it is a matter of the veiy first importanee for the Siugeon to remember the different J)earinfjs of the parts in the neighbourhood of the vessels, and the relative freguency with u'hich the origin and termination of the artery corresponds ivilh certain fixed points that may readily be detected. The points of importance are the relations of the vessels to the lumbar vertebrje, to the crest of the ilium, and to the umbilicus. The ordinary place of division of the abdominal aorta is on the body of the foiu’th lumbar ver- tebra, 01 on the iin ertebral disk below it; according to Quain, this was the case in three-fourths of the bodies he examined, or in 15G out of 196. In re- gard to the relations between the situation of the biftucation of the aorta and the crest of the ilium, we find it, according to the same anatomist, to have ranged in about four-fifths of the cases about half an inch above and below the eyel of the highest point of this part of the bone. With reference to the 11m- bihciis, no definite riile_ can be laid down; but in general terms it maybe stated that the bifurcation of the aorta is a little to its left. As a general rule, that given by Hargrave is perhaps sufficiently good for ordinary piir- poses If a point be taken about half or thi-ee-qiiarters of an inch below and a little to the left of the umbilicus, and a line be drawn on each side from this point to the centre of Poiipart’s ligament, we obtain about the direction of the three equal ^o thMsTn^fl! f wdl correspond to theprimitivetrunk,andthelower tWrd t^ he h ft' ® ^^tth the middle third to the bifurcation of the common iliac artery. The^point of dmsion of the common iliac artery is, in the majority of cases.146 SPECIAL ANEUIilSAIS. between the middle of the fifth lumbcar vertebra and the middle of thcsaerum, both points inclusive ; and if it be notin this situation the division will probably be lower down. The length of the vessel varies gveatly ; aecording to Quain, in five-sevenths of the cases it ranged between one-and-a-half and three inches! Results.—Writing in 1852,1 stated that Avhen we look at the depth at which this artery is situated, its great size, and proximity to the centre of the eircu- lation, and consider the force with which the blood rushes through it, we can- not but be struck with the success which has attended its ligatui-e. Of 17 cases in which it had been tied, 8 were cured, and ‘J died ; in 11 of the cases the ligature was applied for aneurism, and of these 7 recovered. The 4 that died j)crished rather from the magnitude and extent of the disease than fr’om the effects of the operation ; and it is remarkable, as shoudng the power of the anastomoses in maintaining the vitality of parts, that in no instance did gan- grene ensue. Since this period the operation has been performed many times, but with much less satisfactory results. Stephen Smith, of New York, published the statistics of this operation in 1860, giving the details of 32 cases ; of these, he says, 25 died and only 7 recovered. I think the numbers should be 24 and 8 ; as in one case (Bushe’s), the patient (an infant) died two months after the operation, the ligature having separated and the artery being- occluded and thus the deligation having succeeded. Gurlt of Berhn, in repro- ducing Smith’s tables, adds 2 cases, both fatal. To these must also be added a fatal case by Dugas, of Charleston, and five in which the operation has, Avithiu the last few years, been performed in this country ; once by Bicker- steth of Liverpool; once by Syme, in a remarkable case of iliac aneurism, in which that distinguished Surgeon laid open the sac and tied the arteries (the common, external, and internal iliacs) opening into it—both successful; once by Hargrave of Dublin, whose patient died on the seventy-third day after the operation, of gangrene of the foot and profuse discharge from the wound ; and once by Maunder, the patient, a man forty years of age, dying on the sixth day from gangrene of the loAver extremity ; by Morrant Baker in a youth of 17, for hEemorrhage from a branch of the internal iliac, consequent on ulceration produced by sacro-iliac disease—fatal on the day folloAAung the operation. These cases increase the total number to 40, of which 10 recovered and 30 died ; in 9 of the cases the peritoneum was wounded, and of these 8 proved fatal. Of 14 cases in which this vessel Avas tied for htemorrhage, 13 proved fatal; the majority of the recoveries took place after operation for aneurism—^which con- stituted about half of the cases. Treatment by Compression has been successfully apphed to aneurism of the iliac arteries. The compression must be apphed to the aorta by means of Lister’s tourniquet (Fig. 65), as in the treatment of aneurism of the abdominal aorta (p. 137). A considerable number of cases have now been cmed by these means. They have already been referred to when treating generally of the subject of compression of the arteries for cure of aueiu'ism. j\Iiu-ray insists on the importance of complete arrest of the circulation in these cases, so that not the shghtest current of blood should pass through the sac. One of his cases Avas cured in three-quarters of an hour. One of Heath s (of New- castle) consolidated in twenty minutes. LaAvson in one case applied two tour- niquets—one to the abdominal aorta, the other to the femoral beloAV the sac.147 LIGATURE OF THE AORTA. The abdominal toimiiquefc had to bo removed at the end of twenty minutes, owng to collai)se and vomiting ; the femoral one was maintained. “V^Tien the abdominal compressor was removed the pulsations had already diminished, and at the end of four hours they ceased ; the patient making a good recovery. Holmes has collected 10 cases of iliac or ilio-femoral aneurism, treated by this method ; and of these, 7 were cured, and in 3 the treatment tailed. These 3 afterwards underwent ligature of the artery leading to the sac—in one case the abdominal aorta—and all died. These statistics clearly show that no operative treatment is justifiable, except after the failure of compression. Ligature of tlie Aorta.—It is impossible not to contemplate with admi- ration the man whose mind was the first to conceive, and whose hand was the fiist to carry out, the determination to apply a ligature to the abdominal aorta ; and who, guided by pathological observation and physiological experiment, to uiTest at once the circulation through the main channel of supply to the lower half of the body, trusting to the collateral cii'culation for the maintenance of the Htality of the parts thus suddenly deprived of blood. Sir A. Cooper was the first to place a ligature on the aorta, in 1817. Since that period the operation has been six times performed for aneurism ; viz., by James, of Exeter ; by Murray, at the Cape of Good Hope ; by Monteiro, at Rio Janeiro ; by South, of London ; by j\IcGuire, of Richmond, U.S. ; by Stokes, of Lublin; and once, in circiunstances which will be presently described, by Czerny, of Vienna.

The patient survived forty hours. James ligatiu’cd the aorta much in the same way as Sir A. Cooper did, in a case in which he had previously employed the distal opera- tion for an inguinal aneurism ; but without success, the patient speedily dying. Mm'ray ligatiu’cd the vessel by making an incision on the left side, in front of the projecting end of the tenth rib, and carrying it downwards for six inches- to the anterior superior spine of the ilium. The parts were then carefully divided to the peritoneum, which was separated from the iliac fossa and the- psoas muscle, when, noth great difficulty, and by scratching with the end of an elevator and the finger-nails, room was made for the passage of the ligature round the artery, which was tied three or four lines above its bifurcation. The patient died in twenty-three hours. The most interesting case on record is that by Monteiro, who tied the aorta for a large false anem-ism. on the lower and right side of the abdomen ; here the incision was made much as in Murray’s case, and the artery ligatured with gxeat difficulty. The patient lAed till the tenth day, wffien he died of secondary haemorrhage. In South’s case, the aorta was tied behind the peritoneum by an incision on the left side of the abdomen. The patient died in forty-three hours. McGluire’s patient had an aneurismal tumour of the size of a goose’s egg in the left iliac region. Digital pressure- near the umbilicus was attempted, but could not be done. The operator’s intention was at first to tie the left common iliac artery ; but, finding the disease more extensive than he expected, he enlarged the incision and tied the- aorta. The sac burst dming the manipulation necessary to reach the aorta, and about a pint of blood was lost. The patient died in eleven homs. Stokes compressed the aorta wdth a silver wire passed round it in the way of a ligature. He made a crescentic incision five-and-a-half inches in length in the left side of the abdomen, extending fr-om an inch below the tenth rib to the middle of Poupart’s ligament. The abdominal muscles and fascia transversalis were then incised, and the peritoneum exposed and drawn out of the iliac fossa. It was accidentally, but only slightly wounded. The patient being turned on his right side, the arteries and aneurism were exposed, aud the wire passed by means of an aneurism-needle round the aorta immediately above its bifurcation. The patient died in twelve hoiu’S. Perhaps the most interesting point in this remarkable case is the fact’of the pulsation retiuning in the left (sound) femoral artery nme hours after the operation ; showing how rapidly the collateral cir- culation can be re-estabhshed. Czerny’s case scarcely belongs to the present category, but may be mentioned here. The patient was a French soldier, the- upper part of whose thigh had been shattered by a ball during the Franco- German war. Secondary hEemorrhage occim-ing, Czerny tied the common femoral, and also the superficial femoral below the origin of the profunda. This arrested the luEmorrhage for a time ; but in six days it recurred. Czerny then tied the common iliac ; but, as the hemorrhage continued, he thought that he had tied the external iliac, and proceeded to apply another hgatiu-c-- which he placed by mistake on the aorta. The patient snmved twenty-six hours. In this case too, twenty-two hours after the operation, the iniured limb was cold and as if dead, while the opposite limb was warm, and retained sensation and motion.149 GLUTEAL AAD SCIATIC ANEURISMS, In this operation, there ai'e not only all the dangers attendant ligature of arteries of the first magnitude, but also the risk of producing fa al peritonitis, whether the abdomen be cut through, or the vessel sought for by strippino- up the peritoneum from the iliac fossa ; and it appear^ to me that a n tiait sufibrim^ W an inguinal ancmism as to justify ligature of the aorta, would liaA'e a better chance of recovery, or rather ol prolongation of life by the adoption of proper constitutional treatment, together with piessuie upon the tumour and the distal ligature or compression of the artery. Lister s aortic compressor might be applied in such cases, so as to modei-ate the flow of A^muiiisw OF THE Lvterxal Iliac .vnp its Branches.—Aneurism of the Triinlc of the Internal Iliac Artery is extremely rare. The only case with which I am acquainted is one related by Sandifort. The three principal branches of this ai-tery—the Gluteal, the Sciatic, and the Pudic—hoNB aU occasionally, though rarely, been found affected by this disease. Of these branches, the glutc°al has been most frequently found anem-ismal, the sciatic next, and the pudic least frequently ; indeed, I am acquainted with only one instance of Ruem-ism of this vessel. It is the preparation 1701 in the Museum of the College of Surgeons ; and it exhibits an anem-ism of the trunk of the pudic nearly an inch in diameter, full of fibrinous lamime. Anerufisms of the Gluteal aud Sciatic Arteries may be either traumatic or spontaneous. Fischer of Hanoi'er has pubhshed vdth comments, in the ArcTiiv fur KUnische Chiruryie, the records of thirty-five cases of gluteal and sciatic aneiu’ism : to which must be added a case of gluteal aneurism described by Gahozzi of Naples and one by Bickersteth of Liverpool. In twenty-seven of the cases the aneurism was distinctly gluteal; and in six distinctly sciatic. Thhteen of the gluteal anemisms, and two of the sciatic, were of trau- matic origin ; foiu'tcen gluteal and four sciatic aneurisms were spontaneous. The gluteal aneurism has been generally found situated at the upper part of the great sciatic notch ; but may extend over a large portion of the buttocks. Sciatic aneurism hes more deeply; and a portion of the sac may be -within the pchis. The size of these aneiuisms varies fr'om a slight swelling to a tumoiu’ as large as a child’s head. In almost aU the recorded cases there has been strong pulsation, isochronous with the heart’s beat and whirring and buzzing murmm'S are heard on auscultation. There is almost always pain in the tumom’ itself and in the course of the sciatic nerve, ivhich may be followed by paralysis of the parts supplied by it. The affections with which these aneurisms are most likely to bo confounded are abscesses, medullary tumours, cysts, and sciatic hernia. The diagnosis is sometimes difficult : thus Guthrie ligatured the common ihac artery for a large pulsating tumour in the gluteal region, which presented all the characters of aneurism, but which proved, on the death of the patient eight months after the operation, to be a pime encephaloid tumour. Gluteal aneurisms have on several occasions been opened by mistake for abscesses. According to Holmes, this accident has most frequently happened when the aneiuism has been more or less diffused, and in such cases he suggests that the aspirator should be used to render the diagnosis certain.150 SPECIAL ANEURISMS. In the Treatment, rarions methods have been employed. The sac has leen taut open and the gluteal ai-tcry tied in five cases, all of which recovered, lu another instance, after laying open the sac, the aneurism (gluteal) Avas found to extend into the pehns ; and the internal iliac arteiy Avas tied, Avith a fatal result. Ligature of the internal iliac artery has been performed in eleven cases, six of Avhich recovered. The common iliac artery has been tied in three cases, all of Avhich proved fatal. Injection of the perch!oriite of iron has been used in six cases ; foiu- recovered, one died, and in one the result is not knoAAii. Ligature of the scicUic artery Avithout opening the sac has been performed in tAvo cases, one of which rccoA’cred. Spontaneous recovery is reported to haA’e occun-ed in one case. Ligature of the Internal Iliac.—This vessel Avas ligatured for the first time in 1812. The operation A\'as performed by Stevens of St. Croix, on a negress Avho suffered from an aneurism of the nates, supposed to be of the gliAteal artery, but found after death three years subsequently to take its origin from the sciatic. Stevens in this case made an incision five inches long on the left side of the abdomen, carefully dissected through the parietes, separated the peritoneum from the iliac fossa, turned it on one side, together AAuth the ureter, and passed a ligatime round the artery without much difficulty. Since that time the operation has been done nineteen times ; in six cases A\nth success, by Aimdt, White, Mott (who accidentally wounded the peritoneum), Syme, Morton, and Gallozzi; in thirteen cases uusuccessfnlly, by Atkinson of A'ork (Avhose patient died on the nineteenth day, of secondary heemorrhage), by Bigelow, Torracchi, Cianflone, Porta, Landi, Kimball, AltmuUer, Thomas, J. K. Eodgers, and Higginson ; and twice by the Surgeons in the American Civil War. The success that has hitherto attended this operation is certainly remarkable, AA'hen we take into consideration the depth at which the artery is situated and its gTeat size ; it must, I think, be accounted for by the fact that, although in these cases the patient runs the ordinary risks attendant on the hgatiu’C of the larger peMc arteries from the exposm’e and handling of the peritoneum, yet he is saved the danger resulting fr’om the supervention of gangrene ; the anastomosis between its branches and that of the neighbouring A’essels being so free, and the coiu’se traA'ersed by the blood so short, that no difl&cnlty can arise in the maintenance of the collateral circulation. The steps of the operation necessary for the exposiu’e of the internal iliac artery are precisely analogous to those requisite for the ligatiu’e of the common trunk. When the vessel is reached, it must be remembered that both the external and internal iliac veins are in close relation to it; the one being to its outer side, the other behind it. As these vessels are large, and their coats thin, it is necessaiy that they should be separated by the fingei-nail, 01 the blunt end of an aneiuism-needle, before the ligature is passed round the artery ; care must also be taken not to put the vessel too much on the stretch m applying the ligature, lest the ilio-lumbar artery be ruptured. As the length of the artery varies much, usually ranging between one and two inches, and as when it is short it has a tendency to be placed deeply in the pelvis, it Avould, I think, be more prudent, and occasion less chance of secoiidaiy haimoii lage, for the Surgeon to ligature the common trunk.151 ANEURISM OF DEEP FEMORAL ARTERY. FEMORAL AND POPLITEAL ANEURISMS. "We have, in the preceding section, considered aneurisms afiecting the gi'oin, ■which are by no means of very unl'reqnent occurrence. Anem’isms of the thigh are, liowever, much less frequently met Avith ; but those in the ham are very commonly encountered. Thus, out of 551 cases of auem'ism recorded in the British medical joimials of the present century. Crisp has found that 137 affected the popliteal, and only 06 the femoral artery. Of these GO, 45 were situated either in the groin or upper part of the thigh, and 21 only were truly femoral or femoro-popliteal. The reason of this difference in the frequency of the occuirence of aueiu’ism in different parts of the vessel, may be accounted for by attention to its anatomical relations. In looking at the main artery of the loAver extremity, in its coimse from Poupart’s ligament to where it terminates in the anterior and posterior tibials, Ave see that it may be diAuded in relation to the muscular masses that siUTOund it, into three principal portions : 1. That Avhich is situated between Poupart’s ligament and the anterior margin of the sartorius, and which may be considered ; 2. That which intervenes be- tween this point and the apertime in the adductor tendon, and which may be consideredand, 3. That division of the vessel which corresponds to the ham, and Avhich may be considered jpojoliteal. Of these three divisions, the fii’st and last are comparatiA^ely superficial, and, being unsupported by muscle, readily expand ; while the central portion of the artery is closely siUToimded on all sides by muscular masses, and is very imhkely to be dilated into an anemlsmal tumour. A\ e also find that the inguinal portion of the vessel is closely and finnly iuA’ested by a dense and resistant fibro-areolar sheath, and is well sup- ported by the fascia lata ; whilst in the popliteal space the artery is merely surrounded by the ordinary areolar sheath, and receives no aponeurotic support. This difference in the connections of these two parts of the vessel may, to a certain extent, explain the gi-eater frequency of aneiuism in the ham than in the upper part of the thigh. AxEUEisii OF THE Deep Femoeal Aeteey is of extremely rare occm’rence; indeed, I am acquainted young man under my care in University College Hospital in 1870. There Avas a large tumoiu at the upper part of the thigh, over Avhich lay the su- pei-ficial femoral artery, pulsating freely. The disease Avas cured by compression of the common Avith fiAC cases only. One of these occurred in a lemoral artery, hydrate of chloral being given to reliove^ pam. Another case is recorded by Bryant as liaA'ill" OCCUired in f.bp in-nnHoo n—.l l n ) L' case is recoi’ded by Bryant 1. Coiiiinon Feinonil 2. SnimrlU'.ial Femoral. >eep Femoral.

Aneurism, cut open , a large tumour of^52 SPECIAL ANEURISMS. the thigh, which had not been very closely examined during life, proved to bo a circumscribed aneurism of the deep femoral artciy. Two cases arc recorded by P. ]\Iarshall and J. Watson. In the case which was under my care in the llospital, the disease was recognised by the following signs, which arc characteristic of it, 1. A large tumour extended from three inches below Ponpart’s ligament to the middle of the thigh, raising and slightly separating the adductor muscles and the rectus femoris. 2. All the ordinary aneurismal signs were present in this tumour—the most marked being a peculiarly loud and harsh bruit, and a dry forcible thrill. 3. The superficial femoral artery could be felt running over the anterior and inner aspect of the tiunour, but clear of, and distinct from it. 4. The pulsation in the popliteal and its divisions was strong and perfect, o. All the anemismal signs ceased on com- pressing the common femoral artery, and retm-ned on removing the pressure. The only disease with which an ancm-ism of the deep femoral artery can readily be confounded is pulsating malignant tumour of the femur. The diagnosis from this must be left to the siu’gical tact of the practitioner. In the Treatment of these anem-isms, the Singeon has the choice of three methods ; viz., compression in the groin, or ligature of the external ihac, or of the common femoral. If the common femoral ever should be hgatmed for aneurism, this appears to me to be the case best suited for it. But the choice between the ligature of this artery or of the external iliac must in a great measm’e depend upon the Surgeon’s judgment as to the relative expediency of either operation, and on the height to which the aneinism extends up the gi’oin. But neither artery should be ligatured until compression has been fairly tried and has failed. This may be done digitally or by Carte’s instru- ment, where the artery passes over the brim of the pelvis. It is especially likely to succeed in aneurism of the profunda, owing to the shortness of the trunk and the way in which it breaks up into many anastomosing branches. Hence there is not a free current of blood passing from one large vessel of entry to another of exit, but, as it is broken up and has to filter out through a number of minor vessels, its coagulation may readily be brought about. In the case treated by me, compression effected a cure in twenty-four hom’s, though the aneurism was very large and active. Aneueisms of the Superficial Femoral axd Popliteal Arteries.— These commonly occiu’ about the middle period of life, and are almost invari- ably met with in males, being at least twenty times more frequent in them than in women. Both sides are affected with equal frequency, and occasionally at the same time. According to Crisp, sailors would appear to be more hable to this variety of the disease than any other class. These aneurisms are most frequently sacculated ; in the ham they are always so, but in the thigh they are sometimes tubular. Sijm^otoms.—TAiQ symptoms of Femoral Aneurism present nothing peculiar ; the tumour usually enlarging with considerable rapidity, nith all the characteristic signs of the disease, and assuming a pretty regulai o'soid shape. Popliteal Aneurism usually commences with stifihess and a good deal of pain about the ham and knee, which I have more than once seen mistaken for rheumatism ; there is also a difficulty in straightening the limb, which is generally kept semi-flexed. The tiunour increases usually with great153 LIOATUltE OF rilE COMMON FEMORAL ARTERY. 1 oTcit tendency to become diffused ; these conditions will, r'‘” ivim'uiy depend on the side of the arterj from which it springs. Wtai i u^es^ron, the entevior aspect, next the bone, it increases slowly, hen It aiiscs no ch-uctnres before it. In this case, howeyer, may talce place in two directions. If it be femoro-pophteal, it may pye yay into the general areolar tissue of the thigh, the blood diffusing itself as hig cerhaps as Scarpa’s triangle. When it is confined to the ham, it may either Wve way undei the integuments, and into the superficial structures of the hmb or^elsc under the deep fascia of the leg, where it will compress the posterior tibial nerve and artery. In all cases, the diffusion of popliteal aneurism is likely to be followed by gangrene. -> n, jjiaqnosis.—ThQ diagnosis of pophteal arrerrrism has to be made fr-om chr-onic abscess, from bursal enlargements, and from sohd trmours. In dis- tino-uishing it from chronic abscess, no serious drfficulty can well be experiencec; but it may happen that, when an aneurism has suppmated, considerable difficulty arises in determining its true natrue ; rvhether it be merely an abscess or not. On such cases as these, the state of the circulation in the lower part of the limb ivdl throw much hght. Bursal tumours, often of large size and midtilocidar, are not iinfrequently met rvith in the ham ; but I have never formd any great difficulty in determining their true nature, their elasticity and roundness, together with their mobility and want of pulsation, being sufficiently indicative of their character. The most serious diagnostic difficulty may arise from confounding solidified aneurisms of the ham with solid twnow s, of ■a sarcomatous character, springing from the tibia and femur ; and I have kiiovTi one case of aneurism in this condition, in which amputation was per- formed on the supposition of its being a solid tumour (Fig. 859). Treatment—The treatment of femoral and pophteal anemism may be con- ducted either by compression or by ligatm’e of the vessel leading to the sac. As a general rule, for the reasons already stated, compression should be em- ployed in preference to the ligature ; but yet cases may arise when, from the faihue of compression, or for other reasons, it may be necessary .to hgatiue the femoral artery. The Treatment by Cominession is peculiarly apphcable to these aneurisms, and indeed it is to them that it has chiefly been employed. I need, therefore, say nothing special about it here, but would refer the reader to Chapter XLIII., page 51, for a description of the suliject. Flexion of the knee, which may be considered a modification of compression, is also applicable to these cases, either alone or in combination with compression of the main trunk. It is peculiarly applicable irr those cases iir which the aneirrism is well in the ham (see page Gl). Ligature of the Common Femoral.—Irr lookirrg at the femoral artery, it might at first be supposed that the common trurrk, situated superficially between the infer-ior edge of Poupart’s ligament arrd the origin of the deep femoral, would be the most convcnieirt situatioir for the applicatiorr of the^54 SPECIAL ANEUllISMS. ligature ; but experience has sliOAvn that deligation of the vessel here is ])y no means a successful operation when practised for aneurism. It has been attended by better results ndien done for the arrest of secondary hajuiorrhago from stumps and other traumatic conditions. This arises from the shortness of the triudv rendering it necessary to tic the artery in close proximity to the collateral branch that will constitute the most direct and immediate agent in the anastomosing supply,—the deep femoral, so that the internal coagulum would not readily form. In addition to this, a number of small inguinal branches, such as the superficial epigastric and circumflex ilii, the superficial and deep external pudic, and very commonly one of the circumflex arteries of the thigh, more especially the internal, arise from the common trinik in its short course ; and these vessels, though small in size, constitute a source of great embarrassment to the Siu’geon dm-ing the operation; for, if wounded near their origin, they bleed most furiously, and are a cause of considerable danger afterwards, by interfering vdth the proper plugging of the vessel. The ligatime of the common femoral has, however, several advocates, more par- ticularly in Ireland, Avhere the operation has of late years been done nine times, for AA'ound and aneurism, with six recoveries and three deaths. The successful cases were as follows : Porter, sen., three ; G-. H. Porter, one ; Smyly, one ; Macnamara, one. The vessel may be reached either by a vertical or a transverse incision. The statistics of this operation, ^v^ml performecl for aneurism, are by no means faA'ourable. Secondaiy hmmoniiage has been a frequent and fatal occurrence, in several cases requiring ligature of the external iliac for its arrest. I do not, therefore, think that it is advisable for the cure of anem'ism to have recoiu’se to this operation in preference to the hgatnre of the external iliac ; and it may be laid down as a rule in surgery, that in all those cases of aneurism that are situated above the middle of the thigh, in which compres- sion has failed and sufidcient space does not intervene between the origin of the deep femoral and the upj)er part of the sac for the application of a ligatme to the superficial femoral, the external iliac should be tied. Iiigatirre of the Superficial Femoral.—The superficial femoral artery, in its course from the origin of the deep femoral to the aperture in the tendon of the adductor, is divided by the crossing of the sartorius muscle into two portions of unequal length, which have diflhrent relations to neighboming structures. The upper diAusion of the artery, which hes above the anterior margin of the muscle, is of most interest to the Surgeon, as it is in this part of its course that it is invariably ligatured in cases of aneurism. It is true that John Hunter, in the operation which he introduced for popliteal aneiu ism, exposed and tied the vessel in the middle third of the thigh ; but his example has not been folloAvcd by modern Surgeons, on account of the far greater difficulty in reaching the vessel here than in the first part of its course, ihc superficial femoral, Avhere it lies in Scarpa s triangle, being merely coa erec y the common intcgimient, the superficial fascia and the fascia lata may be reached by as simple an operation as any that the Siu’geon has to per oim oi the ligature of the larger vessels. The line to the artery is taken as follows. The Surgeon marks a point exactly midway between the anterior superior spine of the ilium and the symphysis pubis. From this he draws a line directlyLIGATUBE OF SUPERFICIAL FEMORAL ARTERY. 155 downwards in the axis of the limh, which, if continued, would fall a little to the inner side of the middle of the patella. The guide to the vessel is the Fig. 39S.—Ligature of tlie Superficial Feuioral Ai'terj'. inner border of the sartorius muscle. The point of selection for the applica- tion of the ligature is that where the sheath of the vessels is crossed by this muscle at the apex of Scarpa’s triangle. The operation is performed as follows (Kgs. 398, 390). An incision is made in the line above indicated, beginning two- and-a-half or three inches below Poupart’s ligament, and carried directly downwards for three-and-a-half or four inches. The sldii and superficial fascia having been divided, the fascia lata, which is here very thin, is exposed and opened to the same extent as the incision in the integuments ; the inner margin of the sartorius now comes into view, and im- mediately to the inner side of, and perhaps slightly overlapped by this, is the sheath of the vessels; this must now be cautiously opened, the long saphenous nerve being respected, and the aneurism-needle unarmed passed between the artery and vein, in close contact with the former from within outwards, at least four inches below Poupart’s ligament; it should then be threaded and withdrawn, and the ligature tied. The edges of the woimd must now be brought into contact by a couple of stitches and two strips of plaster ; the liml) being semi-flexed, somewhat raised, laid on its outer side, and wrapped in soft flannel or cotton wadding. The severe pain which is usually complained of about the knee after the tightening of the ligature may best be relieved by a full dose of opium. — A -M —-M Fig. 3!)9.—Uiiigi-.nii of Loft Suimrtioial Fomoral Artory at aiiex of Scar- pa’s Triangle.

The incision should be made directly iu the axis of the limb, and especial care taken not to incline it inwards in the direc- tion of the sartorins. 2. The edge of the sartorius should be exposed to a limited extent, as the surest guide to the artery. ?>. In cutting down upon the artery, the saphenous vein, or any parallel branch, should if possible be avoided. 4. After the sheath has been opened, it will sometimes be found that a rather large muscular brauch is giA’cn off from the artery at about the part where it was intended to ligature it; if so, this must be carefully aA'oided, as well as any small veins that cross the main trunk in this situation. 5. The ligature should be applied about four inches below Poupart’s ligament, so that suffi- cient space may intervene between the origin of the deep femoral, Avhich is usually from one or two inches below the crural arch, and the point deligated, to admit of the formation of a proper coagulum in the vessel. It has, indeed, happened that the ligature has been placed within thi-ee-quarters of an inch of the origin of the deep femoral, without any iujiuious consequences resulting. The proper point, however, for the deligation of the artery is that indicated, W'hich is usually the very spot at which the sartorius crosses it; though, if this muscle be very broad, it may be necessary to draw it to the outer side, and tie the vessel below it. 6. The greatest care must be taken not to M'ouud the femoral vein, which lies behind and somewhat to the inner side of the artery. It is best avoided by passing the needle from within outwards between the two vessels ; the inner side of the sheath being at the same time put upon the stretch by drawing upon it with a pair of forceps. In passing the needle, its end should be kept very close to the artery, and made to circle round it. The vein is generally perforated by dipping the needle too deeply and losing the contact between it and the artery. After the needle has been brought up on the outer side of the artery, a small portion of the sheath will some- times be foimd to be pushed up by it; this must be divided by being carefully touched with the point of the scalpel, when the needle may be earned round the vessel. Results.—Ligatiu-e of the femoral artery for pophteal auemism is an operation that has been so fr'equently performed, that Surgeons seldom think of recording cases of this description, unless they present complications or sequelm of unusual interest or severity ; hence, but little importance can be attached to any statistical deductions from reported cases as to the fatality of this oj)eration, although they may serve as a rough estimate of the piopoitioii maintained between the different accidents, such as haemorrhage, gangrene, &c., that follow it. That the ligatm-e of the femoral artery is attended with more success than that of any of the other large trunks, can admit of no doubt. This is not only in accordance with the general experience of Sm-geons," but is confirmed by the statistics of published cases, even without making allowance for the probability of more of the uusuccessM than suc- cessful having been recorded. Thus of 110 instances, collected by Crisp, m which the femoral artery had been ligatured for popliteal aneurism, oiily Welve are reported to have died ; amongst these, four deaths were caused by secondary hmmorrhage, three by gangrene, and the others by phlebitis, tetanus, chest-disease, &c.

Of eighty-seven cases in which li o nripmtion Avas performed for femoral or popliteal aneurism, thirteen died, Ind in three the operation firiled to cure the disease. Gangrene occim-ec twice and suppuration of the sac not once. Of the deaths, one rras fro smll-pox, twoLm wound of the vein and phlebitis, three from pymmm, one from gangi-cne and amputation, one from disease of the kidneys, and the rest from various other causes. _ i -mnoi- Accidents.—Wound of the Femoral Vein is without doubt the most serious accident that can happen in the operation for ligature of the superficial femoral artery, and is one of which there is especial risk when recomse is had to this operation for aneurism ; as in this disease the_ fine areokr tissue Avhic naturaUy connects the two vessels often becomes thickenecl ami indura e , in consequence of inflammatory action having extended upwards from the sac to the sheath of the vessels. It is best avoided by passing the needle in the way that has been afready recommended, from within outwards, and rotating dose round the artery, unarmed and vdthout the employment of force. This accident is almost invariably fatal, there being but very few instances on record in which patients have survived it; death usually resulting from difirise phlebitis, or the supervention of gangrene. The true cause of the fatal result in these cases was first pointed out by Hadrven, who showed that, Avhen the vein is wounded by the aneurism-needle, it is transfixed at two poiuts, between which the thread is drawn across ; and Avhen this is tied, a segment of the vein is necessarily included with the artery in the noose. It is this inclusion of the ligature within a portion of the vein, where it acts like a seton, and keeps up constant irritation, that occasions diffuse inflammation in the interior of the vessel; and it is consequently this circumstance, and not the mere wound of the vein, that determines the great fatality of this peculiar accident. Guided by this vieiv of the mechanism of the injury, the indica- tions in its treatment become obvious. They consist in removing the ligature at once, and thus, by taking away the main source of irritation, converting the wound into a simple punctme of the vessel, which readily assumes adhe- sive action. The Surgeon should, therefore, as soon as the accident is per- ceiA'ed, withdraw the ligature, and, opening the sheath about half-an-inch higher up, re-apply it to the artery there. The hmmon’hagc from the punc- tured vein readily ceases on the application of a compress. The occurrence of Secondary Haemorrhage after the ligature of the superficial femoral is a troublesome accident, and one in which the Surgeon, to use Fergusson’s expression, “ Avill most assuredly find himself in an eventful dilemma ; ” and in Avhich it is necessary that his line of action should have been Avell considered beforehand, as he may not have much time to spare for reflection when such an event takes place. In cases of this kind four lines of treatment present themselves, \h.: the employment of pressure ; ligature of' the vessel at a higher point; deligation of the bleeding artery in the wound or amputation of the limb.SrjSGIAL ANEURISMS. 158 P) es.m') e may bo ai^plicd by placing a graduated compress of lint or com- pressed sponge, saturated in a solution of pcrchloridc of iron, over the bleediiu'- orifice, and fixing it there firmly by a horse-shoe tourniquet. This mean^ although extremely uucertain, occasionally succeeds ; should it not do so’ bower-er, and bleeding recur a second time, it is useless to continue it, as experience has shoAvn that the hemorrhage will continue until the patient'is worn out. Lujaiure of the superficial femoral at a higher point, or, if the artery have been tied too high for this, the dehgation of the common femoral, or of the external iliac, presents itself as a probable means of arresting the hemonhage. Such an operation, however, is fraught with danger, and has, I believe, im-ari- ably been followed by gangrene. It might at first be supposed that the limb would not be placed in a worse situation after the ligatm-e of the external iliac whether the superficial femoral had been previously tied or not; the anasto- mosing channels remaining the same in either case. But in reahty it is not so ; for, although the blood might find its Avay through the epigastric, the circumflex ilii, the gluteal, and sciatic arteries, into the deep femoral and its branches, yet from this point the difficulty of its transmission through the limb would be materially increased. If the superficial femoral be open, it ■serves as a direct and easy channel for the conveyance, to the vessels of the leg ■and foot, of the blood brought by the anastomoses. But -nffien the superficial femoral is tied, this blood must find its way through a second chain of anas- tomosing vessels,—those intervening between the branches of the deep femoral and the articular arteries of the knee ; and here the real difficulty would arise, its impulse not being sufficient to overcome the obstruction to its passage through these small channels, which might not improbably be still fiu’ther obstructed by the pressime of the aneurism. Should the anastomosing circu- lation be sufficiently free to maintain the vitahty of the limb, it is not im- probable that the recurrent blood would escape from the distal side of the ligature, and thus keep up the hinmorrhage exactly as in case of wound. It appears indeed that the femoral artery, in a case of secondary htemoiThage after the application of the hgatiu’e, is in very much the same eondition as an artery which has been wounded, and in which the bleeding, having been sup- pressed for some days, has returned with violence : and certainly the best com-se for the Surgeon to pursue is the same practice that he would foUow in the event of secondary htemorrhage occinring from a wounded vessel, viz., to cut down vijon the Heeding goart and apply a ligature to it. That such an opera- tion is surrounded 'with difficulties cannot be doubted ; yet none would present themselves that care and skill might not overcome. The Surgeon would cer- tainly have to cut into a part infiltrated with blood, in which the different tissues could not readily be distinguished, and the vessel when reached would be found to be soft, friable, and granulating ; yet, by free dissection above and below the wound, a portion of it might at last be exposed, where its coats would hold a ligatime ; or should this not be found, the wound might be firmly plugged from the bottom with compressed sponge ; or the bleeding aperture might be touched with the actual cauterj'’. Should these means fail, it would, be safer to amputate the liml), than to endeavour to aiTest the hmmorrhage in any other way.159 DOUBLE POPLITEAL ANEUPISAL Gantrrene of the Limb is perhaps the most frequent source of danger after lio-aturc of the femoral artery for popliteal aneurism. It seldom occins, howem unless the tumour be of considerable magnitude, have become dmused,’or otherwise interfere seriously with the circulation though the hmb. I ImVhowever, seen it follow the operation where the popliteal aneurism had not attained a larger size than that of an orange ; but, m this case, there was much oedema of the limb, and congestion of the veins, before the opera- tion • and, on examination afterwards, it rvas found that the popliteal vein had been obliterated by the pressure of the tumour. The gangrene may, in some cases, be prevented by the treatment that has been pointed out at page ;>11, Vol. I. When it has ftiirly declared itself, there is necessarily no resource left but amputation, and this operation is sufficiently successful ; for I ffird that of fourteen cases in which it was done, there were ten recoveries, and but four deaths. . tj. i The Return of Pulsation in the Sac after the operation for popnteal anemism is by no means of frequent ocemTenee ; yet it has been met with in some instances, and Secondary Aneurism has also been found in this situation. In these cases the patient should be put upon a careful dietetic plan, the limb be kept elevated and at rest, and pressm-e applied by means of a compress and bandage, or a horse-shoe tourniquet. In this way cures have been effected by Wishart, Turner, Briggs, and Liston. In conjunction with such treatment, or in the event of its not sufficing, the compression of the common femoral artery as it passes over the pubic bone would in all probability effect a cure. Should it not do so, and the tumour continue to increase, threatening to suppurate, or to occasion gangrene, amputation Avould be the sole resource. The External Iliac Artery may requh’O to be tied in cases of popliteal aneurism, when the superficial and common femorals are so diseased as not to admit the ligature. This occurred once to me. A gentleman Avho had lost the left foot and leg from spontaneous gangrene, became two years afterwards the subject of a large popliteal aneurism in the other leg. As compression failed, it was decided to tie the superficial femoral. On cutting down on the vessel the coats were found so diseased, the artery itself being cyhndrically dilated and slightly aneurismal, that the operation was abandoned ; and, as the common femoral felt dilated and almost uncompressible from calcification ■of its coats, it was decided to tie the external iliac. This I did with the able assistance of Sir W. Fergusson, at a somewhat high point, the vessel being somewhat dilated and calcified lower down. Pulsation recurred in the tumour a few hours after the operation, the collateral circulation being very free, and the patient died of secondary haemorrhage on the fifteenth day. Double Popliteal Aneurism.—In cases of this kind the artery has been occasionally ligatured with advantage on both sides, either simultaneouslj'’, or, Avith more safety, consecuiively. But these cases appear to me especially adapted for the employment of pressure, so as to avoid that disturbance of the balance of tlic circulation Avhich is certain to ensue when one vessel is ligatured, and Avhich may act injuriously upon the opposite aneurism. When the popliteal aneurism is conjoined with a similar disease in the groin, ligature of the external iliac is the proper course to pursue, and Avill effect a cure of both affections.SPECIAL ANEUIUSMS. i6o Biffused Popliteal Axeuiusm.—Wlien a circumscrihed popliteal aneurism suddenly becomes diffused, the patient is seized with faintness or sickness, with pain, numbness, and a hot trickling sensation in the limb, the temperature of which fells at the same time that its bulk inereases, and the integument assumes a ivhite, shining, mottled appearance, with more or less purplish dis- coloration. This condition usually occurs after a circumscribed aneurism has existed in the ham for some weeks or months, and on the occurrence of some sudden exertion. In some cases, however, the disease appears to have been diffused from the very first, the coats having given way, and extravasation having taken place into the areolar tissue of the limb, without the previous consolidation of the parts around the artery, or any attempt at the formation of a sac. In these cases the extravasation into the limb may either be con- joined with much oedema ; or it may be confined to the areolar tissue of the ham, and to the upper and back part of the leg, or may extend downwards under the muscles of the calf. When the patient comes under the observation of the Surgeon, the tumour is found to be solid, elastic, and irregular, without imlsation or bruit; the limb oedematous, cold, and congested. The diagnosis of this form of aneurism is often extremely difficult, and there is great danger of confounding it with simple extravasation into the caff, with abscess, or, possibly, with maligmant tumour of the leg. Treatment.—The danger attending on popliteal aneurism is greatly increased by its becoming diffused. In these circumstances the ligatiu'e of the artery usually affords but a slender prospect of success, the collateral vessels being so compressed and choked by the pressure of the effused blood as not to admit of the circulation being carried on through them ; hence, in many of these cases, the only resource left to the Surgeon is to amputate the limb. Amputation for Diffused Popliteal Aneurism.—The question of Anvputaimx in cases of diffused popliteal aneurism is not veiy easily submitted to any very positive or definite rules, except where the impending gangrene is so evident as not to admit of doubt. There are, however, certain general considerations that may guide the Surgeon in deciding on this important point. 1. In some cases, the sac has either given way to a I'ery limited extent; or else its walls, havhig become thin and expanded, are yielding rapidly under the pressure of the blood, becoming confused with the surrounding parts. Here we should hgature the artery without delay : for although it is but seldom that a limb can be saved when once the blood has become infiltrated into the general areolar tissue, yet it is possible that such a fortimate occurrence may happen. 2. In other instances the aneurism has not fr’om the fii’st been I'eiy dis- tinctly circumscribed. It has followed the infliction of some mechanical injury, and in the course of a week or two has acquired a considerable size, Avithout definite or distmet hmitation, being solid or but little compressible. Such a case as this can scarcely be considered, strictly speaking, a diffused aneurism ; but yet, if by circumscrihed we mean that the blood is contained in a defined cyst ivith walls, it scarcely complies with such a definition, the fluid blood being rather prevented from escaping widely by a temporary barrier ot coagula entangled in the loose areolar- tissue of the part, and the vessel beingAMPUTATIOy^ FOR DIFFUSE POPLITEAL ALEURISAI. i6i extensively ruptured or completely torn across. Here we are certainly justified in having recoimse to compression or ligature, with a good prospect of 3 When the ham is occupied by a large rapidly increasing timiour, extend- ing perhaps some way doini the ealf and up the thigh, and encroaching on the knee, the skin covering it being more or less discoloured there being no pul- sation perceptible in the tibial arteries, and the veins of the limb being full and even somewhat congested, the foot cedematous and several degrees in temperature below that of the opposite limb, the difficulty of coming to a decision is considerable. « t, In such a case as this, I think that the existence or absence of distensile pulsation is a circumstance of very great importance, and may serve to guide the Surgeon. If there be distinct impulse of a distending character, which can be arrested by compression of the femoral artery, with some diminution of the size of the tumour, it is evident that blood is being transmitted through the sac, and that this contains some fluid blood. In these circumstances it will, when the artery is tied, subside to a considerable extent, thus allowing more space for the conveyance of the collateral circulation ; and it would be but right to give the patient the chance of preserving his limb by ligaturing the vessel. If, however, the tumour have, from the very first time when it attracted the patient’s notice, been more or less solid and incompressible ; and, though it may at an early period have pulsated, if this pulsation have suddenly ceased, the aneurism at the same time having undergone rapid and great increase of bulk with much tension and lividity of the integuments, oedema and coldness of the limb, vdth a tendency perhaps to vesication and ulcera- tion of the skin covering the tumour, there is no resource left but ampu- tation. It must, however, be borne in mind, that the aneurism may become dif- fused, and extensively so, without any very great change in the shape and size of the limb. It is only when the sac ruptures in such a position that the blood is effused into the general areolar tissue of the limb or under the skin, that much tension of the integuments and increase in the bulk of the part take place. 4. When a rupfure occurs in a part of the sac that is more deeply seated, the blood is extravasated underneath the deep fascia of the leg, and is bound down by this and by the superincumbent muscles; and disorganisation of the interior of the limb may be the result, without much, if any, change in its bulk or in the coloiTr of the integuments, but with excessive deeply seated pain. There must always be considerable risk, in such a case as this, of confounding the arterial disease with a solid tumour; and the diagnosis can be effected only by a reference to the early history of the case, and more particularly to the existence or absence of pulsation at this period. Indeed, the existence or absence of pulsation in these cases is of the utmost importance in reference to the question of treatment. The pulsation may have ceased in a case of diffused popliteal aneurism, in consequence of the blood that has been extravasated being so confined and bound down by the fascia and muscles under which it is VOL. II. MSPECIAL ANEURISMS. i62 effused, that it eompresscs or seals the mouth of the artery leading into the sac, to such an extent as to arrest the passage of blood through it, cither wholly or so that it enters in a feeble stream of insufficient force to communicate an impulse to the fluid that has been extravasated into the limb. This pressure may, as in the case of which an illustration has been given (Fig. 35G), be conflned to the deep parts of the limb, and not give rise to much, if any, general tension of it, the blood being confined below the deep fascia, where it communicates the sensation of a hard, solid, elastic tumour devoid of pulsation. Attention should consequently not be too exclusively directed to the state of general tension of the surface of a hmb, as this is by no means necessarily an indication of the state of the parts beneath : but the Siu’geon should rather look to the presence or absence of pulsation. If pulsation still exist, the blood continues to find its way into the sac, and most probably thi-ough it, the tension of the parts not having yet reached its maximum. If there be no pulsation, he may be sm’e that the entrance of blood into the diffused aneurism has ceased in consequence of compression exercised on the mouth of the artery leadmg to it, by the tense condition of the surrounding and enveloping tissues re-acting on the mass of blood effused beneath them. In such a state of things as this, the vitality of the lower part of the limb can only be maintained by the blood that may find its way thi’ough the anastomosing channels; and this may be sufficient for the piu’pose if the tension of the Mmb be not general, the extravasation being- confined below the deep fascia. If sm-gical interference be delayed in such a case as this, the deep fascia will soon give way by over-distension and rupture, and the blood will be infiltrated into the general areolar tissue of the limb ; and then, by compressing those collateral branches that have hitherto maintained a feeble circulation in it, will infallibly occasion gangrene. If, on the other hand, re- com-se be had to ligature of the main artery, the anastomosing circulation, which may have been barely sufficient to keep up a feeble vitality in the leg and foot, will be so much interfered with that gangrene of the limb inevitably ensues. The only resom-ce, therefore, that is left in these cases is to amputate at once, in order that the patient may be saved the shock of the constitutional dis- tiubance occasioned by the setting in of mortification, as weU as the pain and risk of a previous unnecessary operation. 6. lATien gangrene threatens, the leg and foot having become cold, the skin being either pale, tafionT", and mottled, or discolom-ed, of a purplish hue, with perhaps vesications and much oedema, whether the ligatiue h’ave been previously apphed to the femoral artery or not, or whatever the condition of the anem-ism may be, whether circumscribed or diffused, the patient will stand a better chance of ultimate recovery by having the limb removed at once above the knee. The part at which amputation should be performed in these cases is a point deserving consideration. If the femoral artery have been hgatured, the thigh should be amputated on a level with the ligature, the ai-tery being cut just above this. In this way the double risk which the patient would otherwise run of secondary haemoiThage from the seat of the hgatiue, as n ell as from the face of the stmnp, will be reduced to a single chance of hasmorrhage iiom the stump. If the amputation be the primary operation, it should be done at the lower third of the thigh, provided the extravasation be confined to below the knee ; or higher up, if the effused blood have extended above this joint.LIGATURE OF TIBIAE ARTERIES. 16.^ TIBIAIj ARTERrES. aneurism op the Aneurisms of the Tibial Arteries arc extremely rare, except as the result of wound, yet they are occasionally met with; and in the museum of St. George’s Hospital is a preparation of a small aneurism of the posterior tibial. I have only seen one case during life, that of a man suffering from cardiac and renal {liseasc, admitted into University College Hospital under my care for an aneurism of the anterioi tibial at the lower part of the upper third of the right leg. The signs were wcU marked—pulsation forcible and ex- centric, brnit loud. Compression was used without avail; and as he was anasarcous, no other siu’gical treat- ment could be adopted. He left the hospital uucured. The tibial arteries sometimes require ligatime either for injiuy or for disease. Ligature of the Tibial Arteries.—The Pos- terior Tibial Artery maybe tied in two parts of its either behind the ankle or in the calf of the leg Fig. 400.—Diagram of Left Popliteal Ai-tery. A. Popliteal Ai-tei-}'. V. Vein. N. Internal PoplitcalXervo; M. Biceps Muscle. course The line of direction of the posterior tibial artery is from a point about one inch below the knee, and equidistant from the two sides of the limb, to a point one finger’s breadth behind the internal malleolus. Behind the ankle it may be reached by making a semilunar incision three inches long, about three-quarters of an inch behind the inner malleolus, towards which its concavity should look. After dividing the integument and superficial fascia, the deej) fascia, which is usually single, but may be double, must be laid open ; this closely invests the vessel, nerve, and tendons in this situation; imder it the artery will be found accompanied by two veins, from which it must be separated before the ligature is passed. Anterior to the vessel, and nearer the bone, are the tendons of the flexor digitorum communis and tibialis posticus muscles ; behind, are the nerve and the tendon of the flexor proprius pollicis. In the middle of the leg, the posterior tibial artery should be tied only for a wound in that situation. In such circumstances no regular operation can be performed, but an incision of suf- cient length, taking the wound for its centre, should be made through the gastrocnemius and soleus parallel to their fibres, when, after these have been cut through, the deep fascia will be exposed. This must next be opened, when the artery Avill be found accompanied by its veins, and having the nerre to the outer side. Brom the depth at which the vessel is situated, and the free incisions that it is necessary to make through muscular parts It IS extremely difficult to apply the ligature in this situation. The latter steps of the operation may bo much fiicilitated by flexing the leg on the thio-h and extending the foot, so as to relax the muscles. ^ The Anterior Tibial Artery may be tied in several situations • but like the posterior tibial, it should not bo ligatured in the upper or middle parts of M 2 Fig. 401.— Diagram of Right I’osterior Tibial Artury, belli iid Inner Malleolus.

The difficulties of the operation are lessened as the ankle is approached, where the artery becomes superficial, and may easily be secured. The line of direction of the anterior tibial artery is from the inner side of the head of the fibula to a point exactly midway between the two malleoli; and the course of the dorsal artery of the foot is fr’om this point to the cleft between the first two toes. In the upper third of the leg the artery lies deeply between the tibialis aartiens and exteaisor communis digitorum muscles, surrounded by veins, and having its nerve to the outside. If it be ever found necessary to tie it in this situation, the incision requisite to expose it should be made at least four or five inches in length ; and especial care should be taken not to cut into the muscular substance, but to open the fii’st intermuscular space to the outside of the tibia, at the bottom of which the vessel will be found. In the middle third of the leg, the artery will be found between the tibialis anticus and the extensor proprius poUicis ; it is best reached here by keeping well to the outside of the tibialis anticus. The Arteria Dorsalis Pedis may be felt pulsating, and may readily be secured, as it runs forward ft'om the ankle-joint to reach the space between the first and second metatarsal bones, lying between the tendon of the extensor pollicis and that of the extensor brevis digitorum, by the inner tendon of which it is crossed at its lower part.165 SUBPERIOSTEulL ABSCESS. DISEA-SES OF THE ORGANS OF SUPPORT AND MOTION. CHAPTEP. XLVI. —♦— DISEASES OF BONE. PERIOSTITIS. Inflammation of tlie Periosteum is of common occuiTence as a result oi iniuries, as a morbid process dependcut on disease of the subjacent bone, or as a consequence of syphilis and rhemnatism. It often affects the membrane covering the shaft of a bone, and very commonly the articular end, becoming associated Avdth inflammation of the contiguous joint. When it is acute, the membrane becomes thickened, soft, and vascular, and loosens from the sub- jacent bone. When chronically inflamed, the periosteum becomes thickened by the deposit of plastic matter within and beneath it, and the subjacent bone usually participates in the changes, undergoing hypertrophy and indmation, constituting a node (Vol. I., p. 8G7). SyAiPTOiis.—The symptoms of periostitis consist of a hard, elongated, but somewhat puffy swelling without cutaneous discoloration—a node—not dis- tinctly circumscribed, and attended by much pain in the part, especially at night, with tenderness on pressine. Treat3IEXT.—In the treatment of the acute form of the affection, the free application of leeches, udth hot fomentations, and the admmistration of calomel and opimn, will ainest the disease, and gii^'e relief to the patient. In the more chronic form, the continued administration of the iodide of potassium wiU take dowTL the swelling, remoA^e the noctiunal pains, and materially improA-e the local condition of the part. In those cases of periostitis which are of syphilitic character, iodide of potassium may almost be looked upon as a spcciflc. Added to this, the occasional application of leeches and repeated blistering will be of essential service. If there be much thickening, the parts suffer from the tension of the structures ; here considerable relief Avill be afforded by the free diA’ision of the periosteum down to the bone, either through the skin, or subcutaneously by means of a tenotome slid under it. Subperiosteal Abscess is an acute disease attended by great swelling and redness of the limb, deep tensive pain of the most severe character, and great constitutional febrile distm’bance. The limb becomes oedematous after a fcAV days, but without relief to the symptoms ; the swelling localises itself, and at last deep fluctuation may be detected. The bone that is most commonly affected is the tibia, at its anterior part, doubtless OAving to its exposed situation subjecting it more readily than other bones to the common causes of this inflammation, viz., blows and cold. Subperiosteal abscess of the tibia usually occiu’s iu children and in very young adults.166 DISEASES OF BONE. The pus is thick, and has been found to contain bacteria as soon as the abscess is opened, in this respect differing Irom the pus of ordinary acute abscess in the soft structures. At the bottom of the abscess the bone Avill Ijc felt bare and rough. There is a superficial patch of osseous structure in a state of acute necrosis. The death of the bone is due to the violence of the inflammation. A scale is killed by the intensity of the local inflammation, just as a shred of areolar tissue may die from the same cause. The scale will separate at a later period. In some cases, however, a great portion of the shaft will be found to be involved, and the case is one rather of acute general necrosis than of ordinary subperiosteal abscess. The Treatment of subperiosteal abscess is simple and rational. A free and deep incision through the inflamed, tense, and thickened periosteum lets out the pus and gives immediate relief. After this has been done, the Sm’geon must wait for the separation of the necrosed bone before the Avound will heal, and the treatment then resolves itself into that of necrosis. OSTEITIS. Osteitis A'aries in its characters, causes, and results, according as it affects the long or the short bones, the compact or the cancellous structm’es. When affecting the shaft of a long bone, it usually occurs as the result of blows or of exposm’e to cold and Avet. When it occiu’s in the articular ends, or in the short cancellous bones, although often immediately excited by these causes, it is more commonly associated Avith a strumous habit of body. In these cases, also, it frequently folio ays that deterioration of health which is consequent on scailatina or measles. Acute Osteitis commonly leads to necrosis of the affected bones, and is more ifequent in the shafts than in the articular ends of long bones. When oc- curring in the cancellous bones, it leads to acute caries. Its symptoms and pathology wiU, therefore, more coiiA'eniently be considered when Ave speak of these diseases than at present. Chronic- Osteitis is that which ocem’s most commonly from slight trau- matic or climatic causes in delicate or strumous children. It is a fertile soiu’cc of inciu’able disease of the spine-joints and bones, and Avill frequently be re- ferred to in its congestiA'o and strumous forms in treating of these affections. Pathology.—When a jAortion of bone is chronically inflamed, the periosteum and medullary membrane participate in the morbid action, and, together with the affected osseous structiu’e, become highly vascular ; at the same time the inflamed bone becomes enlarged and softened, partly in consequence of changes induced in its organic constituents, and partly in consequence of the cancel- lated structure becoming expanded from interstitial absorption; the cancelli being filled Avith a sero-sanguineous fluid. The compact structure of inflamed bone midergoes a peculiar kind of laminated expansion, so that a section of it presents an appearance of concentric parallel layers. When the inflammation is chronic, its character AviU vary according as it is strumous or not. When it is strumous, the bone is expanded, softened, and reddened. This form is often seen on ends of long bones, especially the tibia. AYhen traimiatie, on the other hand, and when occurring in a healthy subject, the bone beeomes A-eiy dense, indurated, and compact; looking and cutting moie like ivoiy t lan ordinary bone. In these cases the medullary canal becomes closed by deposit167 the AT ME XT OF OSTEITIS. ^ 1 olvi honp • incl if the bone have been cut short, as on the end of* a of new and haid ho , ‘ rnnnded Sometimes considerable elonga- stump, ^villtecomosm^ j ^ t:::ir*"ostoiti‘s, L HWa aom o„o and a half to two inches longer symptoms of chronic osteitis consist of enlargement of the hone with deeplv seated pain and great tenderness in the limb: the XI p— f “ chronic is much influenced by the state of the weather. ^ ^ TreItme^'T—In the treatment of the acute cases, om-principal rehanc must be on local leeching, with hot fomentations, poultices and ^ the more chronic form of the affection, when the bone has become Sickened and enlar<^ed, nothing of a curative kind can be adopted ; and the only remedy coiisists in the administration of iodide of potassium the jehe^ the pain iiith perhaps the occasional application of leeches. Should ' in mi-ing relief, and the pain continue of an excessively distiessin^ a pei-sistent character, I have for many years past practised the following operation of Umar osteotomy. An incision about three inches long is ma e directly down on the clmonically inflamed and indicated bone, beii^' came through the periosteum, so that the scalpel grates upon the bone. By means of a Key’s saw this cut is extended into the substance of the bone as far as the mcdiiUai-y canal, or deeply into its canceUoiis tissue. Some bleedmg occiu’S, but it can always be arrested by position and pressime. The wound is then closed. ■\Yhen osteitis tends to harden and consolidate the bone, there is no danger connected with this condition ; but it often becomes distressing from the severity of the tension and nocturnal pain accompanying it. men osteitis is of the strumous character, there is great danger of its termi- nating either in caries or in chronic siippiu’ation of the affected portion of bone. In either case an early, deep, and free incision, by linear osteotomy, should be made into the inflamed bone. Nothing relieves the tensive pain so effectually as this, and nothing stops so decidedly the tendency to secondary mischief, whether in the form of caries or of abscess. In this way tension is taken off; and the pain, which appears to be dependent on the compression of inflamed bone by its own condensed structure, is at once relieved. “ Linear osteotomy ” is an operation especially applicable to osseous nodes of the long bones, or to chronic osteitis of the articular ends of the tibia, and is a far less severe mode of treatment than trephining the bone, which has occasionally been adopted in such cases ; while it is equally efficacious. After a time, when all morbid action ceases, the hypertrophied bone does not give rise to any very serious inconvenience, except such perhaps as may be occasioned by its bulk. Osteitis is principally of importance to the Surgeon from its connection with other more serious diseases of bones, in wLich it not nnfr-eqiiently termi- nates. These conditions are Suppuration of Bone, its Ulceration, Caries, and Necrosis. The best and simest mode of preventing these serious sequences is the early performance of osteotomy, as just described. SUPPURATION OP BONE. Suppuration of Bone may present itself in two forms, the Diffused and the (Hrcumscribeit.DISEASES OF BONE. i68 Diffuse Suppuration: Osteo-myeUtis. In this disease the medullary membrane is primarily affected, the inflammation rapidly extending through the ■\vhole of the medullary canal and adjoining cancellous structure, which speedily become filled with pus. Stanley observes that the medullary membrane becomes ^•ascular like the conjunctiva in chemosis, and is often black and gangrenous. Osteo-myelitis commonly occurs as a consequence of injm-ies by which the medullaiy canal is opened, such as compound fi’actures, more particularly of the femur. It may also be developed as the result of the injmy sustained by a bone in an amputation or excision. The presence of the disease may be suspected when, after an injury to or an operation involving a bone, the limb swells, and becomes tender, abscess forms, and profuse suppimation is established, more abundant and more persistent than can be accounted for by the amount of inflammation in the soft parts around the bone. The suppm’ation may’ amount to many omices of pus in the day, and the discharge is often dark and fetid. The soft parts retract from the bone, and this where exposed is dry, yellow, and dead, being denuded of periosteum. This disease is midoubtedly most dangerous, usually proving fatal. In it death may ensue in two ways—either by the exhaustion consequent on the prolonged and profuse suppuration, or by pymmia dependent on thrombosis of the veins of the bone and consecutive blood-poisoning. There is a triple pathological sequence of osteo-myelitis, osteo-pHebitis, and pya3mia, which is of a marked character. Pathology.—Osteo-myelitis is a diffuse inflammation of the medullary mem- branes of the long bones, the interior of which has been opened up to the air by accidental or surgical wound. It is of an erysipeloid or diffuse character, and in the majority of cases affects a septic type of disease. It is, in fact, one of the septic diseases that add to the fatality of the larger amputations and severe injuries of bones. Sir Joseph Fayrer, Avho has had abundant opportunities of studying this disease in India, and who has done much to point out its connection with pyaemia, makes the following important practical remarks as to its causes. “It (osteo-mye- litis) is no doubt to be classed among the large group of evil results Avhich are to a great extent caused by what has been recently called ‘ Hospitalism,’ and it sometimes appears almost in an epidemic form, but it may and does occur periodically under the most favourable circumstances.” After death, the appearances presented by the inflamed bone will, if it ha’\'e been the seat of compoimd fractiu’e, be conflned to the upper fragment; if it have been the seat of amputation or excision, they will extend thi’ough the whole of the bone that is left. They are as follows. The periosteum and outer surface of the bone will appear to be slightly injected. On making a longitudinal section of the bone, the part that is inflamed will be found to present the follovdng appearances. The medullary canal is fllled with pus or a reddish puriform fluid ; the medullary membrane is swollen, soft, pulpy, of a deep red or reddish-brown colour ; the compact bone has a pinkish tinge, and the cancellous osseous structure is often of a bright rosy hue. In a case of compound fracture, the contrast between the deej) coloration of the inflamed portion of bone and the naturally pallid apj^earance presented by that Avhich is not diseased, and more particularly the deoj) red hue of the medullary mem-169 treatment of osteo-myelitis. iIa • 1.1 onri t-lio nale Tcllo'vvish waxy-lookiii};’ fat filling fclie mednllaiy bmc ui he 0.^0 a„ ™™rkablc.

If an operation be performed upon the continuity of a bone affected with diffuse suppuration in the medullary canal, the injury inflicted by the saw is very liable to set up m-eat inflammatory action, and to develop the disease in the part of the bone which is left. Hence, if secondary amputation of an injured limb should be rendered necessary, the bone being affected with osteo-myelitis, it is strongly m’ged by some Surgeons, especially J. Roux, that the operation should be performed at some joint above the injured and diseased bone, in preference to amputation through its continuity. Roux, ’5\-ho had extensive experience in the Italian war, successfully disarticulated the thigh at the hip-joint, in four cases of osteo- myelitis consequent on gunshot injuries of the lower end of the femiu’. Of 22 cases in which he performed secondary disarticu- _ lation of other joints for osteo-myelitis, all recovered ; whereas supimration of every soldier died, Avhose limb was secondarily, amputated Excision of' the through the continuity of the injured bone after the battles of Eihow-Jomt. jMagenta, Montebello, Marignano, and Solferino. On the other hand, Lairey does not consider disarticulation absolutely indispensable, even in cases of acute osteo-myelitis ; and Longmore has met with cases in which recovery has followed the simple removal of portions of dead bone —the disease in these instanecs having assumed a clironic form. Fayrcr advises that, where osteo-myelitis is suspected to be present in a stump after amputation, the moduUa should be examined by a probe. If this soon impinge on healthy bleeding medulla, the Surgeon may wait for the efforts of natime to throw off the diseased l^one ; if, on the other hand, the probe encounter only dead bone and pus, then the sooner amputation is performed, the better. The special danger in osteo-myelitis consists in the tendency to the super- vention of osteo-phlebitis and pyaemia ; and, in determining upon the amputa- tion or excision of a bone thus affected, it is of the first importance not to delay the operation until pyaemie symptoms have set in. There is a period between the development of the local osseous inflammation and the constitutional pyaemia, which it is most important not to allow to slip by. During this period the patient is affected by surgical fever, but there are no rigors. If onee the charactenstie rigors and the high temperature and profuse sweats of pyaemia have set in, I believe that operation can be of no use, as the patient will certainly perish of secondary deposits or of pyaemic blood-poisoning. But, Fig. 402. — DiffuseDISEASES OF BONE. 170 before rigors have oecurrcd, the amputation may be done with a good prospect of success. Chronic Abscess of Bone.—-■The more chronic form of suppuration of bone usually assumes a circumscribed character, and leads to the formation of abscess. The abscesses are usually mot Avith in the cancellated structure, and occur Avith special frequency in the head and loAVcr end of the tibia. In some instances they arc tolerably rapid in their formation, but in the majority of cases are excessiA’cly chi’onic. I^Ten of a more acute character, they are probably the result of the softening of tubercle previously deposited in the bone ; and, forming in the cancellous structure, are very apt to undermine the contiguous cartilage of incrustation, and eventually to burst into the neighbouring joint (Fig. 403). When of a more chronic character, they are usually of A'cry small size, and are deeply seated in the substance of the head, or in the medullary canal of the bone ; the osseous substance covering them, having long been the scat of chronic inflammation, becomes greatly thickened and indurated. l\Iost commonly the quantity of pus contained in these abscesses is extremely small, and it is often mixed with cheesy or tuberculous matter, or contains portions of necrosed bone intermingled Avith it. In some cases, hoAA'ever, Stanley has observed that abscesses of bone are large, containing a considerable quantity of fluid. The SymiAoms of chronic abscess of bone are usually of the following character. The patient, after the receipt of an injiuy, perhaps, has noticed that at one spot the affected bone has become swollen and painful; the skin covering it preseiwes its natural colour in the majority of cases, but in some instances becomes red, glazed, and oedematous ; the pain, Avhich is of a lancinating and aching character, is usually remittent, often ceasing for days, weeks, or months, and then retmning, under Fig. 403. -Al)scoss iu tlie Ile.iii of the Tibia. the influence of veiy trivial causes, Avith its original severity. It is especially troublesome at night, and is always asso- ciated AAT-th a degree of tenderness of the part; and indeed, in the inteiwals of its accession, it will be found on careful examination that there is abvays one tendei spot in the enlarged and indmated bone. The long persistence, for years perhaps, of these signs wiU tff the existence of a small circumscribed abscess under the thicxened wall of the bone. But it must be borne iu mind that the same_ local_ symptoms may be induced by three other conditions : 1, by the inclusion 0 a sme portion of dead bone ndthin a dense and imperA-ious casing ; 2 by the h the osseous strnctures, greatly thickened and condensed by chionio flammation, and, 3, by the expansion of the bone by “ For all practical pmposes the diagtiosis is of httle L co, - ment is the same, whether the pain and other symp oms .mse flnement of a few drops of pns, from the inclusion of necrosed bone, from the pressure of hypertrophied osseous tissue, or from cys ic isease. cleueiid The danger of chimiic abscess of the end of a long bone aviII gieatly depend171 TREATMENT OF ABSCESS OF BORE. on tl. articula;. - this, it will probably lead to thinning and evcntiial^ dis- 1 m 1 Fig. 404.—Bone Treidiiiie. intco-ration of the cartilage, Avhich at last be- comes perforated, so that the pns and osseous debris enter the joint, which is at once and acutely destroyed. If the chronic osseous abscess be situated near the junction of the epiphysis with the shaft, this event is not so likely to occur, d'he suiTOunding bone simply becomes thick- ened ; and though the health may suffci fiom the^ constant wearing pain, the joint is not in peril, and relief may readily be given by operation. Treatment—A& a cii-cumscribed abscess in bone cannot perforate the dense osseous structure overlying it by any process analo- gous to the pointing and discharge of an abscess in the soft parts, it becomes necessary for the Siu’geon to open up a vent for the jDus. This may be done either by linear osteotomy or by the trephine. In some cases simple linear osteotomy, as described at p. 1G7, may be practised ; but should the bone be much thickened and the osseous structiu’cs greatly indurated, the trephine is the best in- strument to use for opening the abscess. The proper way of doing tliis has been pointed out by Quesuay and Brodie. It consists in trephining the bone, so as to make an aperture for the exit of the pus, with an instrument having a small crown, of the size represented at a, Fig. 404. So soon as a vent has been given to the j)us, which is often cheesy and occasionally very offensive in its character, the patient will experience oreat and permanent relief. In performing lUc osteitis mui cii-- * ^ ^ cuiiiscirl36cl ‘VljSCCSSCS this operation, there are several points that deserve special of many years’ dm-a- attention. The bone must be exposed by a T- or V- shaped incision, made over the spot which has been found to bo uniformly tender on pressiu’e : and to this the trephine should Ire applied. The trephine should have a small and deep crown of the size and shape represented in Fig. 404 ; and it is well always to be provided with trvo instruments of the same shape and size that will exactly tit the same hole, lest one become disabled by the density and hardness of the osseous case, as I have seen happen. When the trephine has penetrated to a sufficient depth, the button of bone may be removed by means of an elevator; hut care should be taken irot to perforate the whole thickness of the bone. Tire diseased cavity will very commonly at once be opened in this way, a small cpiantity of pus escaping, which may, however, readily be overlooked, as it is can’ied away in streaks rvith the blood, which Hows172 DISEASES OF BONE. freely from the cut bone. Should uo pus escape, perhaps a portion of dead bone, or some dark gritty masses of disorganised osseous tissue, are exposed ; if so, they must be removed with a gouge. But if neither of these conditions be found, the Surgeon must not be disappointed, but pierce the neighbouring osseous tissue in diftcrent directions by means of a perforator, when perhaps the abscess will be opened; should it not be so, the patient ^vill still in all probability be materially benefited by the removal of the circle of bone, and the consequent relief to the compression of the osseous tissue. After the operation, the cavity left must be dressed from the bottom with Avet lint, and a poultice be afterwards apphed ; it Avill gradually fill up Avith fibrous tissue, lea\'ing the limb unimpahed in utility and strength. In very chronic cases of circumscribed abscess of bone, chronic osteitis of a considerable portion or the Avhole of the shaft may sloAA'ly take place, the bone becoming greatly enlarged, thickened, and generally diseased from end to end. Fig. 405 is a representation of a section of the tibia in such a state of com- bined suppuration and infiammatory hypertrophy, removed by amputation from a Avoman AA^ho had suffered for 23 years from the disease. In such cases, am- putation or excision is the sole means of relief. CARIES. By Caries some Siu’geons mean a kind of ulceration of bone; others, a species of disintegration of the osseous tissue ; and Stanley includes under this term the various changes consequent on chronic suppimation of the cancellous structure. But caries, I think, properly means a disease of the bone, charac- terised by increased vascularity, softening, and ultimate disintegration of the osseous tissue. It appears to consist in a breaking down of the organised portion of the bone, in consequence of which the earthy matters become elimi- nated in a granular, molecular, and almost diffluent form in the pus formed by the infiammation of the siuTOunding more healthy structimcs. Steuctube.—On examining a portion of carious bone, it aaIII be found to be porous and fragile, of a grey, broAAm, or blackish colour ; partly broken doAvn in softened masses, and partly hollowed out into cells, which contain a reddish-broAvn and oily fluid. The process of Avasting which goes on in the bone, appears to be partly the result of ulceration, and partly ot disintegration of its tissue. In many cases, small masses of dead bone lie loose and detached in the carious caAuty. Around this carious portion, the bone, as well as the medullary and periosteal membranes, are usually extremely Avascular ; and, in many cases, hardened compact masses of osseous tissue Arid be found deposited around the carious cavity, or even forming its exterior wall. These changes are most commonly met with in the cancellous structure, but the compact tissue may likcAvise be affected. As caries frequently occurs in tlie cancellated tissue, it is commonly met AA'ith in the heads of bones ; and here the disease is extremely dangerous, being apt to imdermine and destroy the contiguous articular cartilage, and thus implicate the joint. This caries of the articular ends of bones is consequently a most serious affection, and is a very fr-equent cause of incurable joint-disease, such as suppiu’ation and destruction ot cartilage, folloAvcd perhaps by partial ankylosis. Kelative Feequency.—Bilh’oth and IMenzel of Vienna have examined the question of the relative fr-cqucncy of caries in different bones.

Caries occur- vino- in strimous constitutions, and affecting the short bones, as those of the tamis or spine, or the heads of the long bones, as the tibia, usually, if not always,-commences in the central cancellated structure of the bone, which liecomes congested, softened and disintegrated ; in many cases without any external cause, but apparently simply from the diminution of vitality in those parts of the osseous structure which are farthest from the periosteum, and which do not, like the deeper structures of a long bone, receive a supply of blood ft-om an internal or medullary membrane. In these cases, the inflam- mation of the soft investing parts, and the destruction of the joint, which usually ensue, are consecutive to the disease in the bone. In si/pliilitio constiiiiHons caries is aj)t to affect the surface of the bone, dis- integrating and eroding this iii a remarkable mannei’. This condition has been described by Stanley as true idcercdion of Toono, and he regards it as distinct fi’om caries, and analogous to ulcers of the soft parts. Here the disease does not penetrate deeply, but leaves the surface rough and porous, -with a good deal of inflammation in the soft parts around the affected bone. He states that it only occurs in adults, and in males, and is very chronic ; it is met with primarily in the bones of the spine, but also occurs on the articular smfaces in advanced stages of joint-disease. SniPTOMS.—The symptoms indicative of the occurrence of caries are very equivocal, and are not imfr-equently, in the early stages, mistaken for those of ordinary phlegmonous abscess or rheumatism. They consist of pain in the bone, with a good deal of redness and swelling in the soft tissues covering it ; abscess at last forms, often of considerable size ; and, on letting out the pus, the character of the disease Avill be recogmised, as the bare and rough bone may be felt A\nth a probe, Avhich sinks into depressions upon its surface, which, though rough, yields readily to the pressme of the instrument. The cavity of the abscess gradually contracts, leaving flstulous openings, Avhich discharge a fetid pus, usually dark and sanious, intermixed with gi’anules of bone, and containing a superabundance of the lime phosphates. The fistulous openings are generally surrounded or concealed by high spongy granulations, and the neighboiu’ing skin is duskily inflamed. These sinuses or fistulm arc often long and tortuous. They Avind along and around the muscles, the pus finding its Avay along the lines of least resistance in the muscular planes of areolar tissue, and the external opening being often situated at a considerable distance, perhaps many inches, fr’om the diseased bone. In these cases, a long and flexible probe is required to traverse the sinuosities of the fistulous track so as to reach the bone at its extremity ; and^74 DISEASES OF BONE. licie Sayie s vertobratcd probe (Fig. 40G) is most inTaluablo, being flexible and accommodating itself to the ■windings of the canal. A similar instrument has been also de\ised by Steele of Bristol. Caries is very liable to be accompanied with disease of internal viscera. Billroth, in the cases investigated by him to which reference has akeady been made, found that there were cheesy oi tuberculous deposits in internal organs in 54 per cent. ^ He gH es the proportions in which these were met ■with in disease of different bones as follows : shoulder-joint, 77-7 per cent. ; bones of the chest, G5-5 ; ankle, G4 ; knee’ C2-G ; elbow, G2-3 ; spine, 56'8 ; wrist, 51-2 ; pelvis,’ 50-5 ;’ hip, 4/ 5 ; tibia, 58 ; skull and face, 33‘G. The limgs wei’e most commonly affected. It may be supposed, that in many instances the internal disease arises ■from absorption of morbid material from the diseased bone and its subsequent deposition ; and this Hew is favoimed by the fact that the larger proportions of cases where such disease was found were met with in the shoulder and bones of the chest. On the other hand, as Billroth points out, it is not easy to explain in this way why disease of more distant joints, as of the ankle and knee, should be more frequently accompanied with internal deposits than disease of the hip. Hence the morbid dejrosits in internal orgarrs, accomparryiirg caries, are irr nrany cases at least more satisfactorily explained as being the results of the constitutional vice of which the caries is one manifestation. Certain special diseases of irrteriral organs are also mentioned by Bilh’oth as haviirg been noticed in the cases which he ana- lysed. Among these were subacute or chroiric hydrocephalus : and albumenoid degeneration of the liver, sj)leeir, arrd kidneys. Treatment.—The treatment of caries must be conducted in reference to the constitutional cause that occasions it, the removal of which is the first and most esseirtial elemerrt in effecting a erme. If it arise from syphihs, this must be eradicated; if fr’om struma, the general health must be improved. By the removal of such causes, the disease ■will often cease spontaneously, and even undergo cure, more especially in young subjects. Hence, it is well not to be in too great a himry to interfere, by operative means, in the caries of the small bones of children. I have often seen cases, especially of caries of the bones of the hands and feet, in which an operation for the removal of the diseased bone was apparently indispensable, recover spontaneously on change of air, and attention to the general health of the child ; the disintegrated particles of the diseased bone being eliminated piecemeal. In the first stage of caries, which is inflammatory, measimes should be taken, by means of appropriate local and constitutional antiphlogistics, to subdue the activity and limit the extension of the disease ; and when this has fallen into a chronic stage, constitutional alteratives should be employed. Amongst these, cod-liver oil, the iodides, and change of air, more especially to the sea-side when the patient is young, should hold the first place. Counter- irritation is of little avail in these cases in arresting the progress of morbid175 JtEUOVAL OF CARIOUS BONE. -iction. By means of blisters, iodine, and issues, thickening of the pcnostenm •md of the soft structures covering the diseased patch of bone may be lessened, and pain subdued ; but the real progress of osseous disease cannot, I think, be influenced by such means, when once it has passed the earlies staf>-e of inflammatory congestion. _ When the disease has fallen into a chronic condition, and natime seems unable to eliminate the carious bone, all reparative action having ccascd,^ or beino- inefficient for the restoration of the integrity of the part, an operation becomes necessary. When the operative procedure has reference to the diseased part itself, it is impossible to be too careful in delaying it until the acute stage of the disease has passed, and the inflammation in the bone and siuToundiiig tissues has subsided into a chronic state. Unlep this be done, the excitk°action set up by the operation ivill infallibly give fresh impetus to the disease, which will make more rapid progress, and may perhaps terminate ill diffuse suppm-ation of the bone. Operations.—The operations practised upon carious bones are of foiu’ kinds ; consisting either in simple Removal of the Diseased Portion of Bone ; in Excision of the Carious Articular End ; in Resection of the whole of the Bone afiected ; or in Amputation of the whole Limb. Before proceeding to the Removal of the Carious Portion of the Bone the limb should be rendered bloodless by Esmarch’s method, as the operator will then be able to see exactly what he is doing, instead of working in a deep hole filled with blood. The bone is best removed by means of the gouge. This instinment is especially useful in those cases in which short, thick bones, or the articular ends of the long bones, are affected, with- out the neighbouring joints being implicated. In applying the gouge, the diseased portion of bone should be exposed by a crucial incision, and, if neces- sary, its cavity opened by a small trephine. The gouge, fixed in a short round handle, is then freely applied, and the diseased tissues are scooped and cut out. In order to do this efficiently, it is desirable to be furnished Avith instruments of different shapes and sizes, so that there may be no difficulty in hollowing or cutting away every portion of bone that is implicated. I have found the rjoufjeforcein (Fig. 414), a very useful addition to the gouge in clearing away angular fragments and projections of bone, and thus removing the Avhole of the diseased structures. In some cases Marshall’s osteotrite (Fig. 407) will be found a very serviceable instrument, clearing away the softened carious bone without risk to the siuTouuding healthy structures. In removing the carious bone with these instruments, the Surgeon may be sometimes at a loss to know when he has cut away enough. In this he may generally be guided by the difference of texture loetween the diseased and healthy bone ; the former cutting soft and gritty, readily yielding before the instillment, whilst the latter is hard and resistent; so that, when all the disease is removed, the walls of the cavity left will be felt to be compact and smooth. Ill some cases, the healthy bone may have been softened by inflam- mation ; should there be any doubt as to the condition of what has been gouged out, it may bo soh'cd by putting the detritus into water, when, if carious, it will become either white or black : whereas, if healthy, but inflamed, it will preserve its rod tint. In operating on young children espe- cially, it is well not to have the gouge too sharp, lest the inflamed, but other-176 DISEASES OF DONE. wise liealthy tiiough somewhat softened bone, be cut away together with that disintegrated by caries. The cavity that is left should be lightly dressed from the bottom, and allowed to heal by granulation, when it will gradually fill up by the deposition of fibrous material in it. Instead of removing the affected bone by means of instxmmcnts. Pollock has recommended that it should be dissolved by the application of a strong solution of sulphuric acid. The treatment is carried out as follows ; the carious surface or cavity being exposed as before described, a solution of equal parts of strong sulphuric acid and water is applied by means of a glass brush or rod, and this may be repeated daily tiU the whole surface is quite free from diseased bone. In deep ca'^ities a piece of lint soaked in a weaker solution (one part of the acid to five or six of water) may be stuffed in and left for two or three days. The slough resulting may in a day or two more be peeled off 'with forceps and the application repeated if any diseased bone can still be seen. The treatment is said to be efficacious, and the pain accompanying it is not severe. IVTien caries affects the articular ends of the bones, as those that enter into the formation of the elbow or shoulder-joints, itymay be so situated as not to admit of removal in the way just indicated, but to require Excision of the diseased articu- lation : this operation we shall consider in a subsequent Chapter. When caries involves a bone so extensively that neither of the preceding plans can successfully be put into operation, it be- comes necessary to perform either the Resection of the whole of the bone, if it be of small size, or Amputation of the limb, if of greater magnitude or if the neighbouring joints be extensively affected. Thus, for instance, resection of the os calcis may be required for caries of that bone ; while, if the whole of the tarsus be afiected, amputation is the only resom’ce. NECROSIS. Fig.407 >rnr- sliall’s Osteotiitc. The transition from Caries to Necrosis is easy. Caries may be regarded as the granular disintegration or molecular death of the osseous tissue, conjoined with suppm-ation of the sur- rounding healthy parts—a condition closely analogous to ulceration of the soft tissues : whilst necrosis must be looked upon as the death of the osseous tissue as a whole—a condition indeed, closely resembling that of gangrene of the soft parts. Whilst caries, however, chiefly affects the cancellous structiu’e, necrosis is met with in the compact tissue of bone, and far more frequently occurs in the shafts than in the articular ends of the long bones. It is, howeA'er, an error to suppose that the cancellous structure is exempt from necrosis ; thus in the head of the tibia, or in the os calcis, small masses of necrosed bone are not unfrequently found Ij’ng in the midst of carious or suppurating cavities. Different bones are afiected by necrosis with varying degrees of frequency. Tlie tibia at its anterior part is most frequently diseased ; the femur in its lower third is also very coinmoiily affected. The lower end of the humerus is not so often necrosed ; but not uncommonly the phalanges of the fingers from whitlow, the skull ftom syphilis, the lower jaw from the emanations evolved 111 the manufactiiic 0177 CHARACTERS OF NECROSIS. phosphorus matches, and the clavicle and ulna from injury or constitutional causes, are found affected by necrosis. ^ Causes. The causes of necrosis are of very various character. We have just seen that it is Preclisposecl to by the structure of particular parts of bone, and is more frequent in some bones than in others. Among the niore consti- tutional causes, we may rank in the first line those cachectic conditions of the system that result from scrofula and syphilis, and those debilitated states of constitution that frequently follow upon scarlet or typhoid fever. ^ In these various states, the bone may suddenly lose its vitality, more especially if the limb be subjected to slight accident, as concussion, or to exposure to some degree of cold. Sometimes the disease results from the vitality of the bone being de- stroyed by the extension of inflammation to it fr’om the neighboiu’ing tissues, as in some casesof whitlow, orby the bone becoming exposed by a neighbouiing abscess. Age exercises a predisposing influence on necrosis. It is not very common in young children, except as associated with caries of the bones of the hands and feet. When it does occur in the long bones in early life, it is usually very acute. In early adult age it is common in the long bones, more particularly the femur and the humerus, and then is usually the direct consequence of injuiy or of syphilis. In other cases, simply as the result of old age, a bone or a portion of a bone dies suddenly, apparently by simple extinction of ■^’itality, mthout any injury or other evident exciting cause. This I have seen occur in the lower ends of the humerus and of the tibia, giving rise to rapid and usually to fatal disor- ganisation of the neighbouring joints, or to death by abscess and constitu- tional irritation. This Senile Necrosis may be looked upon as the counterpart in the bone of senile sloughing or gangrene in the soft parts. Acute febrile distiu-bance, more particularly scarlet and typhoid fevers, are not unfrequent exciting causes of necrosis in the young. Scarlet fever espe- cially is apt to be followed by pains in the leg and about the knee, which at first appear to be of a rheumatic character, but which speedily run into abscess and are attended by all the symptoms of the most acute form of necrosis. Traumatic causes frequently give rise to necrosis. Thus the denudation of a bone by its periosteum being stripped off, may lead to its death ; but, though the bone thus injined often loses its \dtality, yet, if the membrane be replaced, its life may be preserved ; even when the bone is exposed, adhesions may take place between it and the neighbouring soft parts, or gi’anulations may be throuTi out by its surface, Avhich eventually form another periosteum. Necrosis frequently occurs as the result of the detachment and denudation of a portion of bone in cases of bad compound fracture : so also the application of certain in-itants, as the fumes of phosphorus, may occasion this disease, and hence it has been found that, in lucifer-match manufactories, necrosis of the lower jaw is a frequent consequence of the acrid fumes that are eliminated gaining access to the bone through carious teeth, or being applied to the exposed alveoli. Characters.—In whatever way it originates, necrosis may affect the outer laminae only of the bone, Avhen it may be called peripheral; or the innermost layers that suiTound the medullary canal may perish, and then it may be termed cenlral; or the whole thickness of a shaft, or of the substance of a short bone, may lose its vitality. The necrosed portion of bone, called the Sequestrum' presents peculiar characters, by which its nature may at once be rccoo-niscd VOL. II. fDISEASES OF DONE. 178 It is of a dirty ycUowish-white colour, and lias a dull opaque look, and, after exposure to the air, it gradually hecomes of a deep broivn or black tint; the margins are ragged, and more or loss spiculated, and the free surface is toler- ably smooth, but its attached surface is very irregular, rough, and uneven, presenting an eroded or worm-eaten appearance. This eroded appearance is well marked in sequestra that form in the interior of the terminal end of the femm- in a thigh-stimip after amputation, and is well illustrated by Pig. 14, where the lower smooth part is composed of the whole thickness of the bone, the upper rough and spiculated portions of the central portion of lione being sejiarated from the outer layer, and hence being apparently eroded on their exterior. "WTien the sequestrum forms in the cancellous structure, it is usually of a blackish-grey coloiu’, irregular but somewhat ovoid in shape, as if the bony matter had been partially dissolved away ; and here it is fr’equently con- joined with caries of the siuTounding bone. Symptoms.—The symptoms of necrosis are divisible into two distinct periods. In the first, the bone dies and undergoes separation, and an attempt is made by natiure at the expulsion of that portion of it which has lost its vitality. In the second period, the reparative processes for the restoration of the proper length and shape of the shaft are carried on. The particular character of the symptoms depends, however, not only on the stage, but also in a great measure on the seat and extent of the necrosis. In acute necrosis of the shaft of a long bone, the symptoms are extremely ingent. This form of the aflection chiefly occurs in children and young adults. The jDatient is- seized ndth a rigor, has great elevation of temperatiue, and complains of pain in the limb affected, which is often supposed to be of a “ rheumatic ” character. But the limb rapidly swells, becomes red, glazed, and oedematous ; the outline of the bone is obscm’ed by infiltration of the tissue, and the irritative fever is very severe. The severity of the symptoms nfiU depend on the extent of the necrosis, whether it be superficial or mvade the whole shaft. The abscess which forms is under the periosteum, between it and the bone. The pus is bacterial, often offensive when let out. When the necrosis occius in older persons, it is less acute, but in all cases it is ushered in by symptoms of local inflammation of a more or less intense and painful character ; the skin becomes glazed, oedematous, and of a purplish-red tint; abscess, often of large size, and discharging great quantities of fetid or bloody pus, forms in the limb, and burrows 'widely, in proportion to the extent of the necrosis, amongst its areolar planes. If the suppiuation be so extensive as to jeopardise life, as occasionally happens when the thigh is the seat of the disease, the patient sinking into rapid hectic, the su2Dpurating cavity will gi-adually contract, leaving fistulous and sinuous tracts, often of great length mid extent, leading to rough and bare bone, discharging a fetid and ichorous pus, and having their orifices surrounded by protuberant and glazed granula- tions. All these symptoms of inflammation, abscess, and widely siiread supini- ration, have for their ultimate objects the separation and elimination of the dead bone, and the proper formation of now bone as a substitute for that winch has died. They are in the first instance occasioned by, and are not the cause of, the death of the bone. When a bone or a portion of a bone necroses,_it becomes to all intents a foreign body. The adjacent soft tissues resent itsSYMPTOMS OF NECROSIS. 179 Di-csence, ami endeavour to throw it off by an inflammatory action, just as tliev would if any extraneous substance, as a piece of wood, were thriist in amone-st them. But the ultimate result of the action thus set up is not limited to the separation of the dead bone, but extends to the formation of material destined to repair the loss of substance occasioned by the separation and extrusion of the dead bone. , „ , , i „ Tubular or central necrosis consists of the death of that portion of bone which lies in immediate contigaiity to the medullary canal. It is usually the result of osteo-myelitis, and is common in stumps. (Fig. 14, vol. i. p. 47.) In pei-iplm-al necrosis of the shafts of the long bones, as of the femur or tibia, the inflammatory symptoms just indicated are well marked, and the disease usually runs a rapid com’se up to the period of the formation and dis- charge of the abscess. In the case of central necrosis, the pain is usually more severe than in the former case, and is peculiarly deep-seated and throbbing, being especially intense at night. The limb becomes very oedematous, red, and "glazed; the bone enlarges greatly, and abscess at last forms, which spreads videly in the planes of areolar tissue, undermining the muscles, and producing general destruction of the limb, the tissues of which become rigid and condensed, having sinuses leading down through them. On introducing a probe into the channels, the instrument passes through apertimes into the bony case, termed Cloacae (Fig. 408), at the bottom of which the dead bone will be felt rough and bare. Though this is the general condition that occiu’S in central necrosis, it occasionally but rarely happens that a small portion of some of the internal lameUte of the bone dies, and, being included in a greatly thick- ened case of new bone, gives rise to symptoms of osteitis, or closely resembling those of circumscrilied abscess of bone, but not to those characterising necrosis. '^^^len the lohole thiclmess of a shaft dies, the symptoms are always of a very acute kind, the extent and gravity of the inflammatory and suppimative condition being proportioned to the amoimt of bone that loses its vitality. The articular ends usually escape, though even these sometimes become affected, and the joints involved. The reason why the necrosis usually limits itself to the shaft is that its vascular supply is distinct from that of the epiphyses, which draw their blood from the articular arteries. The disease, therefore, in attacking them, would have to enter a new vascular area. When the short cancellated bones or the articular ends of long bones become the seat of necrosis, it commonly happens that the disease is far more chronic than in the other cases. In these cases the necrosis is associated vdth caries; the dead portion of bone being a small round mass lying in a vomica or carious cavity. The shaft is not implicated ; abscess forms, Avhich at first may not reveal its true nature, or, being preceded by continual pain, may be looked upon as a disease of rheumatic character. Suppuration at last occiu-s, some- times rapidly opening into the neighbouring joint, and disorganising it Avith extreme constitutional disturbance ; but more commonly it runs a A’cry chi'onic course. On passing the probe doAvn the fistulous openings that lead through the indurated and thickened soft parts, an aperture may usually be felt in the bone, at the bottom of Avhich lies a necrosed mass not larger than a hazel-nut, suiTounded by carious bone. Acute necrosis especially attacks the shafts of the tibia and femur. In theseDTSKASES OF BONE. I So cases violent and deeply seated pain occnvs in the limb, -wliicb beeomes gcnc- vally inflamed, with much redness and ftTcat swellinf^. Abscess soon forms along the Avhole line of bone between it and the periosteum ; and gi’eat con- stitutional disturbance ensues, Avhich may lead to removal of limb as the only means of saving life. This form of necrosis chiefly occurs in young and cachectic subjects, usually as a sequel of a febrile attack, such as scarlatina or typhoid fcA’er, or from ex'posurc to severe cold. I have also seen it occur as a senile disease in the tibia, the humerus, and in the fibula of persons of an advanced age, fr-om sixty-five to seventy-five years. In these patients the necrosis has set in suddenly, without any obvious exciting cause ; but Avith intense pain, subperiosteal abscess, and inflamed cedematous SAvelling of the limb, Avhich I have more than once seen mistaken for gout. In acute necrosis, the disease usually stops short at the line of junction betAveen the shaft and epiphyses. Hence, and for the reason already stated, the joints escape in the majority of instances. The prognosis of the case Avill maiidy depend on this. If the joints escape, the sequestrum Avill separate, and a soiuid limb may result; if they become invoh'ed, amputation is inevitable. On examination after the abscess has been opened, the bone Avill be found Avhite, opaque, and dead-looking : the periosteum is detached, neAV bone is deposited, the suiTounding parts are infiltrated, and, usually, supjDuration has taken place around the bone through its Avhole length, if the patient be young, or in the circumference if he be old. In many cases, especially in children, the articular ends escape, the necrosis being confined to the shaft of the bone, AA’hich will be found to be detached fr-om one or both epiphyses. To these the periosteum of the shaft, greatly thickened, still remains adherent, and AA'ill become the organ for the reproduction of the bone. In extreme cases, more particularly in old people, the articular ends are inA'oh’ed, and the joints secondarily affected and disorganised. Separation of the Dead Bone.—The process of separation of the dead bone, and the fomration of a new osseous tissue to supply the place of that AA’hich is necrosed, are most interesting phenomena. The separation of the dead bone, or its Exfoliation, is precisely similar to the mode in which a slough in soft tissues separates, the only difference being the time required. Inflam- matory action is set up so as to form a true line of demarcation and of sepa- ration in the substance of the bone AA’hich is still living, and which is imme- diately contiguous to that AAdiich has lost its vitality. In this way a gi-oove is gradually deepened around the edge of the sequestrum, by the absorption, or rather disintegration, of the earthy matter of the living bone, which is carried off by the pus formed in the course of the process; this pus, according tc^ B. Cooper, contains per cent, of phosphate of lime. Along this ^adually deepening line of separation, plastic matter is throAA^n out, from aa nci gianu latious are foi-med that constitute a hairier, as it Avere, between the living and the dead bone, and, extending into the under surface of the sequptnnn, become so implanted in the hollows and depressions Avhich are there found, that this may continue to be firmly attached to the subjacent living bone after all osseous connection betAveen them has ceased.

Iheie ill contact with proliferating „ , i i diminution. J^Iiescher has shown that the detachment of smaU scales of bone may take place by the disintegi-ation of their substance by a process of “ insen- sible exfoliation,” as he terms it. This process is a pm-ely mechanical or physical one, and probably goes on in all dead bone that is in contact witb pus, just as we see it take place in the ivoiy pegs used in the treatment of ununited fracture. This disintegTation of the siu’face of the dead, together Tvith the absorption of the margin of the living bone, in the formation of the line of sepai-ation, explains the fact that the sequestrum will always be found to be of much smaller size than the ca’^ity in which it is lodged. The ultimate expulsion of the loosened or exfoliated sequestrum is effected by the growth of the granulations below it pushing it off the sm'face, or out of the cavity in which it lies. AVhen the necrosed bone is 2’>er-ipheral, it will be readily thi’ovm off in this way, although it may for a time be fixed and entangled by the mere pressure and extension of the granulations. AA^heii the sequestrum is viva- (jinuted within old or new bone, the process of elimination is necessarily very tardy, and may be difficult or impossible without siu’gical aid. The time required for the exfoliation and separation of dead bone varies gi'eatly. AVhen it is superficial and small in size, a few weeks may suffice ; but when the long or fiat bones, as the femur, the scapula, or the ilium, are affected, the process may be extended over several years, and may terminate in the death of the patient from exhaustion before it is concluded ; the con- stitution being harassed and worn out by hectic induced by profuse suppura- tion. Or the disease may fall into a chronic state, the limb becoming rigid, and the tissues much condensed, vuth fistulous apertures leading down to exposed but attached bone, and thus being a source of constant annoyance and suffering to the patient. Reparative Process.—The reparative process adopted by nature for the restoration of the integrity of the bone, a portion of which has necrosed, varies according to the extent of the loss of substance. AA^hcn the outer lamellte alone are necrosed, new bone is deposited by the surrounding periosteum, and the depression that has formed on the surface of the old bone is filled up by a kind of cicatricial fibrous tissue, which ultimately ossifies. If the Avhole of the inner lamelUe of the shaft die, constituting central necrosis, the outer layers of bone l)ecome greatly consolidated and thickened by osseous matter deposited from the periosteum ; in which, in the majority of cases, the circular or oval apertures termed Oloacce form for the ultimate extrusion of the sequestrum (Fig. 4(.)8). In some cases, however, no cloaca; form, the dead bone con- tinuing to be incased in the thickened outer layers. AA^hen the whole of a shaft dies, the reproduction takes place fr’om A’arious sources, principally from the periosteum, which is, indeed, essentially the organ of reproduction of bone, and perhaps from the medullary membrane, if that be left; these becomei82 DISEASES OF BONE. thickoncd, vascular, and detached from the necrosed hone. That the perios- teum takes tlio principal share in the reproduction is c^■ident from the fact that, where it is deficient or has been destroyed, aper- tures {cloaccc) are left in the case of new bone ; and if it be remo^-ed altogether, osseous tissue is either not thrown out at all, or most sparingly by the contiguous old bone, or by the epiphyses. The soft tissues, also, of the limb gene- rally, if thick, as in the thigh, contribute to the fonna- tion of plastic matter, which gradually ossifies, and so tends to strengthen the new case ; and, lastly, the articular ends of the old bone, still presen'ing their vitality, con- stitute most important agents in the reparative process, throwing out sufficient osseous matter to consolidate them- selves fiimly to the new shaft that is formed. The im- portance of the periosteum as the organ of regeneration of bone after the removal of the osseous structures, whether experimentally or surgically by resection, or by necrosis, has been conclusively demonstrated by Ollier of Lyons. This Surgeon has shown by many ingenious experiments, that in the lower animals reproduction of a whole bone may take place, as in the case of the radius in rabbits and pigeons, after it has been removed from within the periosteum ; and that, if the periosteum be dissected off in slips, and twisted here and there between the muscles of the limb, new bone of various shapes may be formed on and by this partially detached membrane. He has further shown that, although in man, after operations and disease, new bone may be formed by the contiguous osseous tissue, and even by the neighbouring soft parts, yet the periosteum is essentially the organ of the regeneration of bone : thus confirming, by new and ingenious experiments, and by additional observa- tions, the views that have just been expressed. The whole of a necrosed bone may, after separation, be repro- duced by the periosteum. This is ad- mirably illustrated by the annexed drawing, taken from the photograph of a preparation in the museum of Hr. J. Wood of New York. The whole of the inferior maxilla had separated as the result of phosphorus disease; the patient, a girl, lived for three years, the lower jaw having been reproduced as a peii'ect riirg of bone, as represented in Fig. 40!). Thus it will be seen that the new bone is formed by the vascular and healthy tissues generally that surround the scat of disease, though in this reparative action the periosteunr and the medullary membrane take the chief share, the epiphyses and old bone the next, and the areolar tissue of the lim> but a very secondary and supplemental part. In acute necrosis, thcie is no Fig. 408.—Central Necrosis. New Bone witli Cloacie; included Sequestrum.

The case of new bone, which necessarily exceeds in circumference the old bone, as this is included within it, gradually contracts both in textm-e and in size, becoming firmer and smaller after the removal of the sequestrum ; and, the cloacm closing so soon as all dead bone has been extruded, it eventually acquires the proper size and shape of the bone ; the medullary canal even becoming lined by a proper membrane formed in it. In this way, restoration of the whole of the shaft of many of the long bones, such as those of the arm, forearm, and leg, will take place, provided ahvays the epiphyses have been left untouched by disease. If one or other of these have been destroyed, aU power of repair seems to be lost. The new bone usually forms with a rapidity that keeps pace with the death and sepimation of the old bone. In acute cases of necrosis, in which amputa- tion has been performed but a few weeks after the setting in of the disease, a thick layer of new bone will sometimes l}% be found under the periosteum ; but in some instances, when the whole of a shaft is necrosed, the new case is not com- pleted, or has not become attached to the articular ends before these are separated from the shaft. In other cases, though complete, it has not sufficient strength to resist the contractions of the muscles of the limb ; in these circum- stances, it may spontaneously fracture—an accident that I have seen happen both in the femur and the tibia—or may become shortened or bent. In other instances, again, when the periosteum is deficient, new bone does not form (Fig. 410) ; but, as the sequestrum separates, the limb becomes shortened, loose, deformed, and useless. Treat:mext.—In the treatment of necrosis, the indica- tions to be accomplished are sufficiently simple, though the mode in which they have to bo carried out often requires much patience and skill on the part of the Surgeon. The first point to be attended to is to remove any constitu- tional or local cause that has occasioned or keeps up the disease ; unless this be done, it is clear that the whole of the rest of the treatment must be ineffectual. Thus, for instance, if the death of the bone appear to result from scrofula or syphilis, those conditions must be corrected. So again, if it arise in the lower iaw from the fumes of , V. -rvVir. Ur- Ml 1 11 Ueflcicnt Fonim- pnospnoius, tne patient must necessarily be removed from tiou of new none, their influence ; or, if it be threatened in consequence of denudation of bone.^^4 DISEASES OE BONE. the best mode of prevention will be to lay down the flaps of integument, and so cover the exposed surface. Abscess should bo opened as soon as it lias fairly formed. The early and free opening of pm-ulent collections is especially imperative when they are suh2)eriosieal. In these cases the constitutional irritation occasioned by the confined pus is often so intense, more particularly in childi’en of feeble constitution, that life is threatened, and can only be preserved by the evacuation of the pus from the midst of the tense structures between which it lies. Removal of the Sequestrum.—After the cause has, in this way, been removed or counteracted, the separation of the secpiestrum should be left as much as possible to the unaided efforts of nature. The less the Sm-geon inter- feres with this part of the process the better ; for, as has justly been obsen-cd by Wedemeyer, the boundaries of the necrosis are known to nature only, and the Surgeon will most probably either not reach, or he will pass altogether beyond them. Here much patience will be required for many weeks or months ; and the utmost the Siugeou can do is to attend to the state of the patient’s health, treating him cai’efaUy upon general principles, removing inflammatory mischief by appropriate means, opening abscesses as they form in the limb, ancT at a later period, supporting the patient’s strength by good diet, tonics, and general treatment, calculated to bear him up against the depressing and wasting influence of continued suppiuation, and of the irritation induced by the disease. So soon as a sequestrum has been detached from the adjacent or underlying bone, by the proper extension of the granulating line of separation, the Siugeon must proceed to its removal. In most cases it is sufficiently easy, when the necrosis is superficial, to ascertain that this separation has taken place, as the flat end of a probe may be pushed under the edge of the detached lamina. When, however, the sequestrum is deeply seated, it is not always so easy to ascertain that the separation has occurred ; though, in the majority of cases, the introduction of a probe through one of the fistulous openings leading to the necrosed bone, and firm pressure exercised upon this, will enable the Surgeon to detect that degree of mobility which is characteristic of looseness. In other cases, however, the sequestrum, though completely removed from all osseous connections, still continues to be fixed by the pressure of the siuround- ing granulations, and by the extension of its spicula into the coircsponding cavities of the new osseous case. This especially happens when the sequestrum is central and invaginated, and the cloacae leading to it of such small size that but a limited portion of it is exposed. Here a more careful examination will be required ; and its looseness may sometimes be determined by pressing upon it with a probe in a kind of jerking manner, or by introducing two probes through different cloacje, at some distance from one another, and alternately bearing upon the exposed bone with one or other of them, ihen, again, if the sound elicited by striking the end of the probe against the sequestium^bc a peculiarly hollow one, the detachment of the bone may be suspected. Ihe dm-ation of the disease, also, will probably throw some light upon the probable state of things inside the new case. The separation of the sequestrum having been ascertained, the Suigcon must adopt measures for its extraction. If the necrosis be pcripho.ial, all t atREMOVAL OF SEQUESTRUM. i8S is necessaiy is to make an incision down it through tlie soft parts, either by j directly cutting upon it or by slitting up sinuses with a probe-pointed bistoury, and then to remove it with a pair of forceps, or to tilt it off the bed of gTanu- lations on which it is lying, by introducing the end of an elevator beneath its edge. "When the necrosis is central, the sequestrum being imbedded in the new case, or covered in by old bone, the operative procedui'cs for its removal are of a more complicated character. The difficulties here consist in some cases in the depth from the surface, and in the obstacle offered by its passage through the soft parts ; and in others, in the length and magnitude of the sequestrum in proportion to the small size of the cloacm, and in the manner in which it lies in a pai’allel direction to these openings. In cutting down upon the bone, the Surgeon must be guided by the direction and the com’se of the fistulous tracks that lead to the principal apertm'es in the new case, the incisions being carried in the axis of the limb, and carefully directed away from large blood-vessels and nerves. In many instances, however, the htemorrhage is somewhat abun- Fig. 411. Fig. 414. Gouge-forceps. Fig. 415.—Straiglit Saw for removing Xecrosecl Bone.

Esmarch’s bloodless method will be found a great assistance in these operations. The bone ha-\'ing been freely exposed, it Avill sometimes be foimd that the cloaca are of sufficient size to allow the ready extraction of the sequestrum. But in the majority of cases, this cannot be done at once, and the apertures must be enlarged, either with the gouge or the treplnne, according to the density of the new case, and the amount of room required. Occasionally, when two cloacm are close to one another, the intervening bridge of bone may very conveniently be removed by means of cutting pliers, of different shapes (as in Figs. 411, 412, and 413), or by means of a Key’s or a straight narrow saw having a movable back to stiffen the blade (Fig. 415), and space thus given for the extraction of the sequestrum. Very convenient pliers for this piu’pose are those represented in Fig. 414. They are made with gouge ends, and hence may be termed gouge-forceps. I have found them extremely serviceable in many operations upon the bones. Care, however, should be taken not to remove more of the new case than is absolutely necessary, as the apertiu-e so made in it will not be fiUed up again by osseous matter, but vdU be closed by fibrous tissue, and thus the ultimate sormdness of the limb might be endangered. For the extraction of the sequestrum, the most convenient instrument is a pair of strong necrosis-forceps, well roughened at their extremity, and straight or bent as the case may require (Fig. 416). Occasionally the sequestrum is so shaped and placed that it cannot be seized with this instrument; in these circumstances it will be useful to drive a screw- probe (Fig. 90) into it, by which it may either be extracted, or so fixed as to admit of seizime and removal by the forceps. In some cases, additional and convenient purchase may be given to the dead bone, by fixing a bone-forceps, such as is represented in Fig. 417, fii’mly into it. II the sequestrum be too laro-e to be removed entire through the cloacae, it may perhaps best be extracted piecemeal, having been previously divided by passing the points of narrow but strong cutting pliers into the interior of the bone. .-n i i a • After the removal of the sequestrum, a smooth hollow cavity will be left in the new case, from the bottom and sides of which blood usually wells up fr-eely, issuing abundantly from the vascular bone, and from the granulations lining its interior. Should this haemorrhage be at all troublesome, inessii ^ will always sufficiently arrest it. Lint must then be hglitly introduced mto bottom of the wound, and the part elevated ; a good deal of inflammation s frequently set up after the operation, but that must be combated on ^ner^ nrinciplcs. If the sequestrum have been a long one and ha^c invoB ireater part of the shift of the bone, it may happen that the new case has not187 XECROSIS OF FLAT BONES. sufficient strength to maintain the limb of its proper length and shape and that it will bend or break under the action ot the forces and weight to which it is snbiected. In order to prevent this accident, it will be necessary to put it up ill light splints, or in a starched bandage. After the removal of the dead bone, the sinuses will speedily close, and the limb eventually regain its normal size and shape. Amputation.—If the necrosed bone be so situated that it cannot be removed, occupying too gi-eat an extent and continuing to be &-mly fixed ; and if at the same time the patient’s health have been worn down by constant discharge, and symptoms of hectic come on ; or if the limb have generally been greatly disorganised by the morbid processes going on in it, recourse must be had to amputation as a last resource. It is especially in the lower third of the thigh- bone that these severe forms of necrosis occur, necessitating amputation of the limb. When necrosis affects the flat posterior surface of this bone above the condyles, a special source of danger occurs in the possibihty of the sequestrum causmg ulceration or woinid of the popliteal artery. In cases of this kind, suddenly fatal htemoirhage might occur. Should the haemorrhage, though abundant, not be fatal, what com-se should the Siu’geon adopt in such cases ? Should he attempt to ligatiu-e the vessel, or should he amputate the hmb ? The line of jiractice must, I think, be determined by the condition of the hmb itself and by the state of the patient’s health. If these be both tolerably good, the limb not too much disorganised, and the powers of the system not too much reduced by hectic, an attempt might be made, by slitting up the sinuses, to expose and secure the popliteal arteiy at the seat of injury in it, and, by liga- turing it, to save hfe and limb. But should this attempt fail, as I have known happen, or should it not be thought prudent to make it, owing to the low state of the patient’s strength, or the disorganised condition of the limb, amputation must be done -without delay. As an idiopathic disease, necrosis of the tibia requiring amputation is rarely met with ; but when it is the result of bad com- poimd fractures, or of other serious injuries, removal of the limb may become imperati-\-e. In acute necrosis of the lower end of the thigh, or of the shaft of the tibia involving the contiguous joints, and attended by deep and extensive abscess of the limb, amputation is imperative. Resection of the whole of the necrosed bone may be advantageously per- foiuned in such cases as those of the metacarpal and metatarsal bones, or in those of the forearm or leg, where sufficient stability of limb is seciu’ed by the remainmg bone or bones to leave an useful member. The diseased bone may be thus removed in necrosis of the ungual phalanx occurring from whitlow, where, by the excision of the dead bone, the end of the finger may be preserved; also in necrosis of some of the metatarsal and tarsal bones, or those of the fore- ann, the inferior maxilla, and the fibula. The remarks that I have hitherto made apply chiefly to necrosis of the long- bones ot the extremities. As there are a few special considerations connected with the necrosis of the flat bones, w'C will now consider these briefly. Necrosis of the Stei-num, Scapula, or Rones of the Pelvis, is an ex- cessively tedious process, there being but vexy little teixdency to the formation of the line of separation and the detachment of the seqixestrum, which will continue bare, rough, and adherent for many years. Should it be so situatedDISEASES OF BONE. i8S that it can be removed, it must be excised, even though not detached. 'When the ilium and pelvic bones are affected iiidepeudeutly of the hip-joint, it is seldom that any operative measure can be employed Avith advantage : here we must leave the patient to the chance of the bone being at length so loosened as to admit of extraction. In some cases, however, if the disease be limited to a portion of the crest of the ilium, or to the tuber ischii, the dead bone may be removed ; although in these instances it not uncommonly happens that disease of a similar kind exists elsewhere about the sacrum or spine, that will eventually destroy the patient. In a case in Avhich I removed a portion of the crista ilii for necrosis that Avas apparently confined to that bone, it Avas found, on the patient dying some AA’eeks aftenA^ards of erysipelas, that the lumbar vertebrm Avere also diseased. Of late years, considerable portions of the pelvis haA-e been successfully excised for necrosis, as aaoU l^e more fuUy mentioned Avhen I come to speak of ^^ision of the hip-joint. The tuber ischii, when affected, may readily be extirpated. Necrosis of the Cranial Bones is of frequent occAirrence as the result of struma or syphilis, or the two conditions conjoined. When met Avith in child- ren, it is usually strumous, often occurring after measles or scarlet fever ; iu adults it is usually syphilitic, though by no means invariably so, being some- times the result of blows in people of otherwise healthy constitutions. There are four situations in which necrosis of the cranial bones may occur, viz., in the vault of the skuU, the frontal bone, the temporal bone, or in the sphenoid and ethmoid bones. When idiopathic necrosis affects the vault, it is usually syphilitic ; when it occurs in the other situations, especially in the temporal bone, it is commonly strumous. Three forms of necrosis affect the cranial bones. In one case, the outer table is alone affected : this perishes, separates, and exfohates; granulations then spring up from the outer surface of the iuner table, and a process of repair is thus established. In the second form of the disease, the Avhole thickness of the skuU necroses, separates from the dura mater and surrounding healthy bone in the usual Avay, and may be detached in large irregularly shaped pieces, some- times of large size, occupying scA'cral square inches. In the third form, the necrosis is hard, dry, rough, and pitted or worm-eaten, penetrating through the d-iploe to the iuner table, separating A'ery sloAvly, and lasting an indefinite period. Results.—In necrosis of the cranial Ijones, there is always the special danger of extension of morbid action to the membranes of the braiu, and the consequent occurrence of inflammatory effusion Avithin the skull, leading to coimilsions, coma, and death. This danger is greatest when the petrous portion of the temporal bone is affected, as the structure of this bone is homogeneous, and the dm-a mater is continuous with the lining of the caA'itics by which it is per- forated. Cerebral complication is less likely to occur Avhen the ffontal bone is the scat of disease, more particularly the loAver part of this boue, Avhere, by the intci’A’cntion of the frontal sinuses, the anterior Avail is altogether carried uaa ay from the inner table, and from all dangerous proximity to the membranes of the brain. _ -in The Si(jns of necrosis of the cranial bones are very obvious.^ hen the A-ault or forehead is affected, there is tenderness, Avith some puftiucss, and gra ua elevation of the scalp into an abscess. When this is opened, the necrosed bone189 XEGROSIS OF PATELLA xiXD RIBS. may be folfc or seen lying, dry and dark, at the bottom of a sinus or unhealed ulcer AVhen the petrous portion of the temporal bone is the seat of disease, thereivill have been ear-ache, followed by profuse fetid discharp from the ear, with perforation of the tympanum, escape of the ossicula auditiis, and deafness. ■\Vhen the s]ihenoid or the ethmoid is affected, deep pains in the head, persistent oedema of the eyelids, and fetid discharge from the nose, will reveal the nature and seat of the mischief. t .i The of necrosis of the cranial bones will vary according to the nature and the seat of the disease. In the dry pitted variety, exposing and scraping the diseased osseous surface or the application of a strong solution of sulphuric acid will often bring about a healthy action, provided the disease have not penetrated too deeply. Should there be reason to think that the inner table has been perforated, it will probably be safer to leave the case te the reparative processes of natiu’e than to trephine. If, however, the anteiioi wall of the frontal sinus be the seat of the disease, or if the supraorbital ridge be affected, the dry and rough bone may be safely removed, as I have on more than one occasion had to do, by the application of the trephine in the first instance, and of the gouge in the other case. AVhen exfoliating necrosis of the outer table, or of the whole thickness of the bone, affects the vault of the skull, the loosened plate may readily be lifted off its granulating bed hj means of the elevator or forceps, after it has been fairly exposed. Xecrosis of the petrous portion of the temporal bone may be looked upon as an inciu-able disease, which is usually fatal fr’om encephalitis. When the sphenoid or ethmoid is the seat of necrosis, little can usually be done by operative interference ; though in the latter case portions of sequestrum may sometimes be extracted thi’ough the nostrils, and in one extraordinary case under my care in University College Hospital, I removed through the mouth the whole body of the sphenoid bone. The patient, a man aged forty-three, had suffered fr’om syphilis for fifteen years, and fr’om disease of the bones of the nose and upper jaw for three years. The anterior part of the hard palate was destroyed, and it was through the fissure so formed that I removed the bone. The fragment included the sella Turcica, and the roots of the j)terygoid processes, but the clinoid processes could not be recognised. The patient had suffered from no cerebral symptoms except occasional headache and some loss of memory. He made a good recovery. The Patella is rarely necrosed. I have, however, met with two instances of primary necrosis of this bone. One case occurred in an eldeily woman. The disease came on without any evident extenial cause, commencing in the anterior part of the patella and gradually implicating the bone, until it became perforated, when rapid suppurative disorganisation of the knee-joint ensued, necessitating amputation. The other case occuiTed after simple fracture of the patella, in a man, and is described at p. 44G, vol. i. Ribs.—AVhen the ribs are necrosed, abscesses and sinuses will often form to a considerable extent on the side of the chest. These must be laid open, and the diseased portion of bone scraped away by the gouge. In doing this, care must of course be taken that the adjacent intercostal space be not punctured by an unfortunate slip of the instniment—an accident that is best avoided by protecting the gouge well with the finger.190 STRUCTURAL CHANCES IN BONE.

The bones are liable to various structural changes, by vRich their size, shape, and consistence are modified, or in consequence of which they become the seat of tumoin-s of various kinds. Hypertrophy op Boye.—Under this term two conditions may be included : viz.. Sclerosis or Thickening of the Osseous Tissue ; and Increased Length of Bones. Sclerosis or hardening of bone sometimes occurs. It may attack several bones at the same time ; and, in the long bones, may lead to filling up of the medullary and Haversian canals with bony substance, with some thickening of the bone. This condition is generally not capable of being recognised -with certainty during Life ; and it may occur without being preceded by any signs of inflammation. It is allied in character to some of the forms of exostosis that will be presently described. Increase of Length of Bones.—Allusion has aheady been made at p. 1G7 to the hypertrophy of bone which sometimes follows chronic osteitis. This increased growth of bone as a result of morbid conditions of that tissue, has been investigated by Stanley and Paget in this country, and by Langenbeck and others on the continent. It has been observed in connection with necrosis, osteo-myehtis, and chi’onic abscess : and also with clmonic hypertemia of the soft parts of a limb. Langenbeck, from his observations, concludes that morbid changes which give rise to irritation and hypertemia of the osseous tissue lead, as long as the growth of bone continues, to an increase both in the length and in the thickness of bones ; and that the increase of growth in length affects especially the diseased bones, but may also occur in a healthy bone of the same limb. Sometimes, as Paget has pointed out, the long existence of an ulcer of the integuments in a young person may produce thickening and elongation of the bone. lARen the femiu’ undergoes elongation in this way, the inequality in length of the hmb, unless the opposite limb be lengthened by artificial means, may lead to talipes of the foot of the lengthened limb or to lateral curvature of the spine. The tibia sometimes becomes elongated, wlnle the fibula remains of its normal length : and in such cases the former bone becomes curved. The diagnosis of this condition fr’om the curvature of rickets consists, according to Paget, in the marked elongation : in the absence of thickening of the ends of the bone, which are usually even more nearly equal in size to the shaft than in the natural state, on account of the thickening of the latter ; and especially in the fact that “ the rickety tibia is compressed, usually curved inwards, its shaft is flattened laterally, and its margins ai’e naiTow and spinous ; while, in the elongated tibia, the ciu’ve is usually directed forwards, the marginsrickets. I9T m-c broad and round, the surfaces are convex,^and the compression or flatten- intr if ihere be any, is from before backwaids. _ , • -i "(trophy of Boxe.—This term comprises two conditions : one in which the bone is wasted, and another in which an arrest of growth occin-s. Wasting Atrophy occurs, as a natural result, in old age ; the change tl a takes place in the lower jaw being a familiar example. In other cases it hap- pens aL consequence of fracture ; the nutritious artery of the bone having Len torn across, and one of the fragments consequently receiving insufficient vascular supply. Atrophy of bone also commonly ocem's fr-om disuse, as is the case in old dislocations. In atrophy, the bone becomes thinner, lighter, and more porous than usual; the compact structure disappearing and the cancellous being expanded. Arrested Growth of bones is an occasional consequence of disease, its occun-ence in rickets wiU be presently refeiTed to. It may also be a result of various diseases of the epiphysis and joints, or of the resection of the epiphysis in children, and may follow the formation of cicatrices after bums in the neigh- bourhood of joints. The effect of paralysis on the growth of bone varies. ^ It is common to see normal groAvth of the bones in limbs affected with paralysis of sensation and motion, even in young subjects, in whom the muscles are wasted ; while in other cases the growth of the bone has been materially impaired, especially at the articular ends. RICKETS, MOLIilTIES OSSIUM, AND SCBOFULOtrS OSTEITIS. Rickets is a disease of early life, never occun’ing after the age of puberty. In it, according to Virchow, the histological elements of the bone are normally constituted, but the earthy matter is deficient; so that the bone continues to be soft, fiexilile, and cartilaginous in structure, at an age when its tissue ought to have undergone proper consolidation. It appears to be atrophied, and the cancellous structm-e to be expanded into ca’^ities of varying magmitude, which contain a brownish-red serous fluid. In consequence of the change of structure and the loss of firm ness in the bones in this disease, considerable distortion of the body takes place. The hmd early appears large and expanded ; indeed, Ivilian states that rickets always first appear in the head, the forehead being especially protuberant; according to Stanley, this arises not from enlargement of the cranial bones, but in consequence of the want of development of those of the face ; the head thus appearing large from its disproportion to the small face. The shape of the liinbs is much changed and distorted, in consequence of their yielding to the pressure of the superincumbent weight ; the pelvis becoming contracted, and the thighs and legs bent either forwards or outwards. Humphry and Langenbeck have called attention to shortening of the bones in rickets. Humphry says that the humerus and femur are one-fourth shorter in rickety subjects than in healtliy individuals of the same age ; and liangen- beck regards this shortening as more constant and more characteristic of rickets, than bending and deficiency of earthy matter. The yow?/s usually appear swollen, from the articular ends of the bones being enlarged. In early life the chest will be observed to be deformed in a peculiar manner, being nanowed above, where the upper ribs are contracted and pressed in, but expanded below, apparently from the weight of the abdominal viscera, which arc often tumefied, and in192 STRUCTURAL GHANGES IiY BONE. these cases drag on the lower ribs. In rickety chilch-en there is a general delicacy of appearance, and occasionally a strumous habit of body, thouo-b according to Rolvitansky, they are not usually tuberculous; if they live^ however, past the age of puberty, they may eventually become sufficientlv powerful in frame. ^ The T) ecittnent of must be conducted on the same general principles that guide us in cases of scrofula ; pure air, good food, and plenty of it, regular exercise, and the administration of tonics, especially cod liver oil and the pre- parations of iron, with scrupulous attention to the general habits of life of the child, AviU generaUy improve his condition to the utmost limits compatible Avith the powers of his constitution, and will, by improving the nutrition of the system, tend to the moi'e healthy deposition of osseous matter. In some cases, the administration of lime-water Avith mills; seems to be of service in suppljong those elements that are required by the system. It is of much importance in preventing deformity in these cases not to allow the child to walk or stand much, but to let it take exercise in donkey-panmers or hand-chairs, and to support those limbs that have a special tendency to become exemwated, Avith properly constructed steel supports, which Avill be found of much use, provided they are not too heavy, or interfere -with the action of the muscles. Methodical friction should also be employed, so as to stimulate the muscles ; as these become more vigorous, their osseous attachments have a tendency to become stronger. Mollities axd Fkagilitas Ossitoi—Osteomalacia.—A most destructive and dangerous disease of the bones, characterised by softening and fr-agihty of the osseous stnicture, is occasionally met Avith. This affection has been studied AAuth much attention by Curling, Solly, Stanley, MacIntyre, and Litzmann; and it is principally from their labours that we are acquainted with the principal facts relating to it. In this disease the bones are bent, their epiphyses swollen, and their shafts broken in various parts of the body. Occasionally, though very rarely, only one is fractured ; but in other cases, as in Tyrrell’s, there may be as many as twenty-tAvo fractures, or, as in Arnott’s, thirty-one. These fr’actures are imattended by any attempt at the formation of callus. The body becomes singularly and distressingly distorted. On examining the bones after death they Avill be found to be hght, soft, and someAvhat gritty—bending, and at the same time readily snappmg across ; occasionally they are expanded and thickened. This happens especially with the skull, which becomes often con- siderably increased in substance. ’ On cutting the bones, AA^ich are soft and yield something hke cartilage, the knife usually encounters a kind of gritty substance. On making a section of the bones they appear of a deep reddish- brown or maroon colour, and will be seen to contain cavities of A’ai'ious sizes,, small or large, but always of a circular or oA'al shape, and generally filled Avith an oily red and grumous fluid, though sometimes they contain clear serum. On examining this red gxinnous matter under the microscope it shoAA’s a cell- development ; hence Solly remarks that it is probably an adventitious morbid product, and not simply fatty matter altered by the effusion of blood into it. Dalrymple has shown that this material is composed of granular matter, nucleated cells, and a few caudate coiqmscles : he therefore believes it to be aSEAT OF MOLLITIES OSSIUM. 193 disease essentially malignant in its nature, but differing from other malignant affections ; for, “ instead of progressively reproducing and developing them- selves without limitation, the new and morbid formations which replace the original and sound structime seem to have been at an early stage of their existence removed by absorption and canned out of the system ” (MacIntyre). It is, however, more reasonable to consider with Virchow that this condition merely represents a retrogade conversion of osseous substance into medullary tissue, which under certain circumstances appears as an extraordinarily soft and very vascular structure, rich in cells ; or as a gelatinous and semi-fluid sub- stance. An excessive production of medullary spaces takes place by absorption of the laminated structure, whilst the osseous corpuscles either become converted into the new cells, or disappear. Paget suggests that two diseases are included under the title of mollities ossium ; one, more common in England, marked by fatty degeneration, but distinct fr-om the condition in which atrophy is accom- panied by fetty deposit: and another, the osteojmosis of German winters, more common in France and Germany, in which there is a simple removal of the earthy matter. He believes that the former affects especially the bones of the extremities, the latter those of the trunk. In chemical compositions, the diseased bone has been found by Leeson to be composed of 18‘75 animal matter, 29'17 phosphate and carbonate of lime, and 7)2‘08 of water in every hundred parts. Cause.—The cause of the comjilaiut is obsciu’e. It would appeal’ that it is frequently connected mth a rheumatic tendency ; as, in every case recorded, the affection has been jireceded or accompanied by severe pains, or distinct rheumatic attacks. In some instances the patients have been affected with syphihs. In a majority of cases it appears to have a connection with the childbearing state : Paget believes that it is simple osteomalacia, rather than fatty degeneration, which occiu’s in these circumstances. It most commonly, though not invariably, occiu’s in females, as pointed out by Kilian. Among 131 patients whose histories have been collected by Litzmann of Kiel, there V ere 80 females, in whom the disease either appeared diu’ing pregnancy and labour, or was modified in its coiu’se by these conditions. Of the remaining 4G patients. So were females, and 11 males. It most generally attacks adults, hanng been observed in few cases under the age of 20 : and it may occur even at veiy advanced age. according to Litzmann, v’aries according as it occurs within the childbearing period, or independently of this. In 80 childbearing jvomen, the whole skeleton was affected in G cases only, and all except the lonos 0 le ead in two ; while in 4G other cases, all parts of the skeleton \ere diseased in 21, and all the bones except those of the head in G.

II. oSTRUCTURAL CHANGES IN LONE. 194 In childbearing women the disease appears to have a remarkable predilec- tion for the pelvis ; it is probable, howe^-er, that a careful examination of all the bones has not been made in all cases. State of the Urine.—In all cases that have been recorded, the urine has been seen to contain large quantities of earthy matter. Solly pointed out that this is phosphate of lime, which has been absorbed from the bone, and thrown out by the kidneys in the urine ; and sometimes the elimination of this matter is so abundant that it forms, as in one of the cases which he relates, a soUd calculus, clogging up the interior of the kidney. In MacIntyre’s case, the earthy matters of the bone appear to have been, in the first instance, absorbed, and carried off from the kidneys by the urine ; but afterwards an animal matter, of a peculiar and apparently previously undescribed character, was discharged in abimdauce. SymjHorns.—These ai’e, in the early stages, extremely obscime and insidious. The patient complains, in the first instance, of Avandering pains about the limbs and trunk which assume usually a rheumatic character, though they have been observed to be of a much more severe, persistent, and intractable nature than those that occur in any form of rheumatism. The patient becomes debilitated, unfitted for exertion, and emaciated. Spontaneous fr’acture now occiu’s in some bones under the infiuence of the most trivial causes; others become bent, and the body consequently greatly misshapen and distorted. The urine presents some of the abnormal characters above described, and death eA'entually residts from general exhaustion. Diagnosis.—The diagnosis of this affection has to be made in the early stages from rheumatism. This is not always easy, and, indeed, is at first impossible ; but after a time, when the peculiar phosphatic condition of the mine and the fragility or distortions of the osseous system manifest themselves, the true nature of the affection becomes apparent. With riclcets it cannot possibly be confounded, as rickets is a disease of childhood, and osteomalacia is peculiar to adult or advanced life. The severe pains and the great distortion, with the tendency to spontaneous firacture which is observed in this disease, are never noticed in rickety children. Treatment.—With regard to treatment, but little can be done ; the admi- nistration of tonics, and a general supporting plan of treatment, may an’est for a time the progress of this terrible affection ; but when once it is declax’ed, it usually progresses from bad to worse, and at last destroys the patient. Opiates may be employed to allay the pain, and in MacIntyre’s case some temporary advantage appeared to result from the administration of alum ; but no remedy has appeared to exercise any continuous advantage in this complaint, which, there is reason to believe with SoUy, is truly mahgnant. A form of osteomalacia, gi^ang rise to excessive liability to fr’acture, is some- times met -ndth in the insane. In such cases, numerous fr-actiu-es of bones, espe- cially the ribs, have been found, and in many of them repair has taken ]fiace. Scrofulous Osteitis.—The scrofulous aflections of bone constitute an important section of the diseases of this tissue in children and young people. Avho are the subjects of this diathesis. They have been for the most part described as the results of the deposit of tubercle in this tissue, but are almost always connected Avith chronic inflammatory processes of a Ioav type.195 SGMOFULOUS OSTEITIS. the exudations of which undergo caseation, whilst the true grey gTanulations 1 1 fnnnrl The characteristic feature of this disease is the produc- are but rarely circumscribed abscess, caries, and tion of chronic 0 ^ canceUous tissue, •uKl^ronsequentV alfect the epiphyses of the long bones more than the shafts, mid frequently iLl to implication and destruction of the contiguous joints in the Lrt 4nos, as those of the tarsus, they commonly lead to canes and n^-rosis ami affecting, as they often do, the bodies of the vertehrm, Tory frequently give rise to some of the most destructive diseases of the spine, attended^y the formation of large lumbar and iliac abscesses. Under the frLnce of this diathesis, a low fom of inflammation is readily established in the osseous tissue, as the result of any slight exposure to external violence or change of tempcrattme ; and this rapidly leads to caries, wath the toation of cmdy pus in which masses of softened tissue may be seen. If this destruc- tive action take place with great rapidity, portions of the bone will be foimc to necrose in small masses, which he at the bottom of these carious cavities, as may commonly be observed in some forms of strumous caries of the os calcis and head of the tibia. These scrofulous vomicce undermine the overlying articular cartilage, and thus opening up the interior, give rise to the most destructive suppu- rative disorganisation in it. Fig. 418 is a representation of one of these vomicm in the head of the tibia, their most common seat. "When the inflammation has been of a more acute character, it may cause disintegration of the whole of the articular end of a long bone, with separation of the epiphysis. These destructive changes may take place with great rapidity ; I have seen them happen in a lad, whose thigh I amputated for acute strumous infiltration of the lower end of the thigh- bone, in less than a month from the first occuiTence of the complaint; the patient, at the time of the operation, being nearly exhausted by hectic, induced by the abundant discharge from the diseased bone, and from immense abscesses in his thigh. When, on the contrary, the changes are limited to a very small area in an otherwise healthy bone, the diseased portion may, as it undergoes softening, dispose to the occuiTence of circumscribed abscess, at the same time that chronic thickening and condensation of the suiTounding bone takes place. It is in consequence of this condensation of the peripheral portion of the bone liy the deposit of fr-esh layers of osseous tissue under and by the inflamed periosteum, and the difficulty that the contents of the abscess necessarily experience in traversing the hypertrophied osseous structure, that the diseased product is apt, when deposited in the vicinity of a joint, to work its way through the cartilages into the cavity of the articulation ; as on this surface no fresh deposit nor condensation of osseous tissue can take place, and consequently no Fig. 41S.—Scrofuloiis Vomica in Head of Tibia.196 STRUCTURAL CHANGES IN BONE. fidditional obstacle is offered to the outward progress of tlie inflammatory pro- ducts, or rather of the curdy matter into which they have become transformed. The existence of these changes in the osseous tissue thus not only gives rise to destruction of the bone and adjacent articulations, &c., but may occasion inflammation and extensive suppimation in the neighbouring soft parts ; indeed, some of the largest chronic abscesses that form iii the body, those connected Avith diseased dorsal or lumbar vertebra), oAve their origin in the majority of cases to the deposition and disintegration of these loAvly organised products in the bones. When once caries has been established in a bone, and the osseous boundaries containing the dehris have become perforated by the accompanying plastic infiltration and abscess and sinuses of the soft parts, &c., these conditions Avill continue in a permanent manner ; the fistulous tracks leadmg down to the bone, and the caAities in it, remaining open so long as any imsomrd matter is left at the bottom of them ; and in this Avay the patient may eventually be exhausted by the copious and continuous discharge from the osseous vomicte. In some favourable cases as the result of natiual processes, and in others from those operations that the Surgeon performs for caries, the whole of these products may be disintegTated, and thus even- tually eliminated, a true vomica being left in the bones, or scooped out by the gouge ; and then the sinus, whether in the soft parts or in bone, haAung no longer this kind of foreign body lying on its bottom, gradually closes—not by the contraction of its osseous Avails, which is of coiu'se impossible, but by the deposition of a fibrous tissue by which the cavity is occluded. Pathology.—Nelaton has devoted special attention to the pathology of these affections, to which he applies the term tubercular, and Avith which he classes the only variety to which the name properly belongs, viz., that derived fiom the deposit of grey granulations in the osseous tissue. He describes two forms of tubercle in this situation ; the first is the encysted variety, which occurs in the form of small masses, of an opaque white or yellowish coloim, contained in a cyst, Avhich is soft, A'ascular, and spongy, apparently of a cellular structure. This variety is stated by Nelaton to be the most common. I haA'e certainly not found it so, but have most frequently met Avith the infiltrated opaque tubercle. The other form in which tubercle occiu's, according to Nekton, is an infiltration into the cancellous structure of bones. This may be in the fonn of semi-transparent gTanulations of a greyish or rosy tint, opalescent and slightly transparent ; occasionally these granulations are firm, so as almost to resemble cartilaginous deposits in the interior of the bone. The osseous stnxc- ture, in the mid'st of Avhich this kind of tuberculous matter is deposited, does not appear at first to undergo any material alteration. Tubercle may also be infiltrated as opaque puriform matter of a pale yellow colour, soft, and Avithoifi vascularity (Fig. 421). The osseous tissue, under the influence of this disease, often becomes, as Nelaton observes, more condensed than natural, the cells being obliterated so as to resemble the compact substance of bone. In some cases it may continue thus chronicaUy thickened and indurated ; but m other instances the tuberculous inflammation will give rise to rapid and destructive inflammation of the siuTOunding osseous tissue, which becomes excessively vascular, and crumbles doAvn into a carious state, Aiiti some necrosed masses intermixed. In other instances, as is not iinfiequcnty oi197 TUBERCLE OF BONE. served in some of tlie forms of caries of the spine, or of white sweUmg s m suppuration takes place in the interior of the hone ; and on the sides or in cenL of the abscesses thus formed, hardened and white ivoiy-lookmg mas and knobs of osseous tissue may be seen to be deposited; these apparent y Fig. 419.—Scrofulou.s Osteitis of Tibiii. fjtr 420.

At b _ are seen the so-called Lacuine of Howship; the material hUmg the dilated Cancellous Spaces a is more or less cheesy eranulation material. consisting of tuberculous bone that has undergone some special modification of structure. All these changes, with the exception of that described as the grey infiltration, appear to be due rather to chronic inflammatory changes, accom- panied by an impaired nutrition and imperfect attempts at repair, than to the development of a distinct new formation. Yirchow pro- poses the name of scrofulous osteomyelitis, as more truly expressing the conditions present in these cases than that of tubercle, which he would limit to the following variety. Tubercle of bone, in the limited sense in which this term is here employed, is un- doubtedly a rare affection. True miliary tubercle in the form of grey granulations, which undergo cheesy changes, and lead to softening and necrosis of the parts around, is occasionally found in the cancellous tissue of the epiphyses, or more commonly in the spongy structures of the bones of the tarsus (Billroth). It is absolutely impossible to form any exact diagnosis of the nature of the changes going on in the bone, which can only be determined by an examination of the conditions of the other organs. There can, however, be no doulDt that the bones of young people, the subjects of tuberculous disease in the restricted sense of the term, are very liable to become affected with caries from very slight causes. In fact, in both struma and tubercle, nutritive functions arc imperfectly performed, and tissues formed under these influences readily suffer when put to any severe trial. Fig. 421.—Cells of Osseous Tubercle.STRUCTURAL CHANGES IN BONE. 198 Treatment.—The treatment of tubercle of bone resolves itself into that of its effects. As its existence cannot be recognised except by the changes -which it induces in the bone, the treatment must be directed exclusively to these. Thus, if it occasion circumscribed abscess, this must be opened : if caries, the diseased cavity and tissue must be scooped out, or removed in accordance with the principles ah’eady laid down ; and if disease of the neighbouring- articulations result, it must be managed in the way that will hereafter be explained. It is of importance, however, to recog-nise the dependence of these various affections of the bones on a scrofulous or tuberculous constitutional state, as it is specially necessary in these conditions that suitable measures should be adopted for the removal of the cause. Thus, good food, sea air, the adminis- tration of iron, of the iodides, and cod-liver oil, -will form most important elements in the treatment; and without these, indeed, it cannot be brought to a successful termination. The progvess of these cases is generally excessively tedious. Stanley gives two years as the time required for a strumous bone to recover itself; and in very many instances this period may even be exceeded. In this, as in all other chronic inflammatory affections of the bone, it is of considerable moment to continue the means of cure until the disease is fuUy recovered from ; for relapse vill occm’ vdth special readiness in the tubercular affections, if the patient be allowed to use the diseased limb or part too soon. Deposits of tubercle in bone may serve as centres whence general tubercu- losis may spread. Hence the importance of their free removal by amputation, excision, or gouging of the diseased bone, according to the extent and the situation of the tubercular infiltration of or deposit in it. TUMOURS OP BONE. Exostosis.—By exostosis is meant the gvowth of a bony tumoiu- from some of the osseous structm-es of the body. The causes that immediately give rise to this disease are usually extremely obsciu’e. There can be no doubt that in some instances it is hereditary ; but, in general, it ocem’s without any distinct or appreciable exciting cause. It is chiefly met with in the young, developing itself about the age of puberty. . Exostosis appears to originate in two ways ; being either primarily foimed and deposited as true bone ; or in other cases being the result of the ossification of an enchondi-oma. Exostoses may be single or multiple. They are usually situated in or near the epiphysis. When multiple, they commonly occur at the insertions ol tendons. Exostoses are of two kinds—the one hard and compact, the other softei and more spong-y. The hard, or Ivory Exostosis, is a structure that differs both in appearance and composition from true bone. It is extremely compact and white, having a gi’anular section closely rcsembhng that of ivory, and presenting somewhat radiating fibres, but possessing a true bony structure, Haversian canals, lacunae, and lamellae. In chemical composition, it is foinid to differ Bom healthy borre in contairring nrore of the phosphate and less ot the carborrate 0 hme, and also in the proportiorr of animal matter being smaller.

Thus I have seen the lower third of the ulna completely arrested in its development by the formation of - the exostoses at the lower pai't of the middle third, the bone being pel- mauently shortened and dwarfed below this point. ^ ^ Treatment.—It an exostosis be so situated as to occasion inconvenience or deformity, it w'ill be necessary to remove it; and as it is a local disease, t^ere is no fear of its return, proAuded this be fully done. If, however, the ivhole of it be not taken away, it may groiv again ; and Stanley accordingly recommends that if it be so situated, as upon the skull, that its base cannot be extirpatec, . potassa fusa or nitric acid should be applied to the part that is left, so as to produce exfoliation of it. The removal of these tumours is best effected by a Key’s or a chain saw, or cutting pliers. In some situations, as when close upon joints, or springing from the cendcal vertebrae, they cannot be interfered with ; and in other cases, as occasionally happens in the neighbourhood of the oibit, their density and hardness may be such that the saw can scarcely work its way through them. There is one A’ariety of exostosis Aidiich deseiw es special attention. It is that form of the disease wdiich springs from the upper surface of the ungual phalanx of the great toe. It forms a small rounded mass, usually about half as large as a cherry, projecting under or beyond the nail, and giilng rise to much pain and inconvenience in ivalking. Diipiiytren, who first described this peculiar variety of the disease, has pointed out the200 STRUCTURAL CHANGES IN RONE. treatment proper for it, Avbicli consists in exposing it by a double clliptic*al incision, and cutting it off with tbc scalpel, or a small pair of pliers, without amputating tbe toe. There is a species of bony gTowtb, called Osteoma, consisting of an miifonn elongated mass of new bone, deposited on some of the osseous surfaces, some- what resembhng a node, and differing from ordinary exostosis in not being pedimculated. This does not admit of remoyal, and is not amenable to any treatment. The term osteoma is also sometimes applied to exostosis in general. EjfCHONDROMATOUS OR Osteo-Cartilaginous Tumours are often met Avith. These have already been described when speaking of enchondroma and its patho- logy (P- 753, Tol. I.), and need not, consequently, be more than adverted to here. They usually require resection or amjoutation of the affected bone, according to the attachments and size of the growth ; but Stanley states that in some cases, Avhere the cartilaginous tumour of bone is of small size, it may be influenced and eventually dispersed by the local application of iodine and mercmy. Cystic Tumours of bone of various kinds are commonly included under the terms Osteosarcoma and Sjmia Ventosa. The former term has also been occa- sionally applied to various other solid growths, whether fatty, fibrous, gelatin- ous, or cartilaginous, as Avell as to A'arious kinds of malignant tiunour springing from bones ; and hence much confusion in the pathology of these affections has been caused. Structure.—The cystic tumours of bone have been well described by Nelaton. They consist of cysts, having various kinds of fluid and sohd contents. The cysts may be unilocular, and these are commonly filled with solid matter ; or multilocular, and they then contain fluid. The solid masses are usually of a fibro-ceUular or fibro-cartilaginous character, filling up completely the cavity in which they are situated, and often attaining a very considerable size. They occiu' principally about the jaivs, and articular ends of long bones, especially the humerus, the femur, and the tibia. The cysts ivith fluid or semi-fluid con- tents attain a much larger size than the last, being often met ndth as lai’ge as a cocoa-nut or a foetal head. On section, they are found to be composed of multilocular cysts, each cavity having distinct walls, and often communicating Avith others. The fluid contained within these cysts is of various characters, thin and serous, sero-sanguinolent, viscid, or dark coloured, often associated Avith masses of fibrous tumoin, appearing as if it proceeded from the central softening of these large growths. The same situations are affected by the compound as by the single cysts, but they are also met Avith in the shafts of long bones. From AA’hatever part they proceed, their walls arc composed of expanded bone, not uniformly thinned, but thickened and nodulated at various parts, Avhilst it is perforated at others (Fig. 422). These cystic tumoins principally occur in adults, being rarely met Avith in children. They constitute smooth, round, or oA'al gTOAAflhs, increasing slowly, but steadily, Avith little or no pain ; the skin coA’ering them being of the normal coloin, and the A'eins usually blue, enlarged, and tortuous. hen a certain size has been attained, so that the shell of bone is expanded into a a cr} thin lamella, and before it is perforated, pressure oii the tumour occasions a peculiar crackling or rustling noise, like that produced by pressing together201 myeloid and FinilO-PLASTIG TUAWURS. a broken ec^o--shell, or the crackling of tin-foil.

This plan has proved especially successful in some of the cystic tumours of the lower jaw ; and I have had occasion to practise it with success in a small cyst fonning in the outer condyle of the humerus. IMyELOiD AXD Spixdle-Celled Saeco- :>IATA are not unfrequently met ivith at the ai’ticiilar ends of the long bones (Fig. 423). They always develop in the cancellous struc- tiu’e ; sometimes spontaneously, at other times as the result of a blow or other injury. Even when involving the shaft of a bone, they usually commence in the central portion of the osseous tissue, and expand outwards. All the long and many of the flat bones are liable to this form of disease. It is most common, perhaps, at the lower end of the femur, and the head of the tibia ; in the head of the humerus, and the lower end of the radius ; in fact, in those portions of bone where there is most cancellous struc- tul'e. In the jaw and the scapida it also occurs ; and I have amputated the thigh for this disease in the fibula of a lad. The disease is local in its development and earlier stages, but has a tendency to recmvence after removal, especially if the whole of the affected bone and infiltrated muscles be not extirpated. Its malignaney is proportionate to the rapidity of its growth ; and the more rapid this is, the greater will be the probability of recurrence and of secondary deposits in internal organs. Ec- current myeloid, after imperfect extirpation, is always softer, darker, and more malignant in appearance and in action than the primary deposit. A myeloid tumour, developing in the articular end of a long bone, may burst into the neighbomlng joint and fill this up with its softened mass. It does this by pushing before it the inerusting cartilages of the joint. These are not destroyed or invaded by the disease ; but, the bone by which they arc supported being disintegrated, broken down, and destroyed, they necessarily separate and lie loosened upon the morbid mass. The stnicture of myeloid tumours has been described and illustrated (Vol. I., p. 770). The accompanying di-awings (Figs. 423—428) afford examples of it in its primary and recurrent forms when occiUTing in bones. Fig. 422.—E.ximnsion of Lower End of Femur by Cystic Tumom-.STRUCTURAL CHANGES IN BONE. Treabnent.—Tumours of bone, bowever simple in their character, are neces- sarily entirely beyond the reacli of constitutional or local resolvents, and Suro'cons have consequently been in the habit cither of gouging or cutting out the tranour, or of removing the whole of the bone from which it springs, cither by amputation or excision ; and in malig- nant disease of bone this is doubtless the only safe coih’sc. But in non-malignant tumours of l)one the case is different, and Sir James Paget has ad- duced several instances to prove that the partial operation may be done with perfect success so far as avoidance of recuiTence is concerned, the tumour being enucleated or shelled out of the case of bone in which it is lodged. The great difficulty, as he justly observes, consists in the diagnosis between the benign and malignant tumoim. The points to which he specially directs attention are the fol- loAving. ■ 1. The age of the patient. If below puberty or past middle age the tumoiu’ is probably malignant, unless it be a common exostosis. 2. The age of the tumom’. If more than of two years’ duration, it is probably not malignant. ?>. If a tumour of bone have doubled its size in six months, not being inflamed—if it be situated on the shaft of a long bone—and if the lymphatics be enlarged, it is probably malignant or recurrent. If a coiicm'rence of conditions point to the non- malignancy of the tumoiu’, and if it be found to have grown from within the bone and to have expanded this in the form of a shell over its surface, then enucleation should be attempted ; if, on the other hand, the symptoms point to its malignant nature, amputation or excision of the whole bone must be practised. Hydatids.—Cavities are occasionally, but very rarely, found in bones, in which large numbers of hydatids are lodged ; according to Stanley, both the Fiy. —Myeloid Tumour of Dower Eud of Humerus of two year.s’ gi-owtli, foUowiuj; Fractui'e of tlie Condyles.

In these cases a cyst forms in the bone, u ic i becomes thin and expanded, resembling the ordinary fluid cystic tumour, Imt203 malignant disease of bone. which on examination, is found to contain the entozoa. Tlie T,mtment,^ Stanle’y observes, must depend on the situation and extent of the disease ; 1 1 Fig. 420.—Spincllc-ceUed Sarcoma Tumour sin ingiiig from the Sciipula.

Multinucleated Myeloid Cells. he a long bone that is afPected, and it be much expanded, recourse must be had to amputation ; if it be a flat bone, the cavity must be scooped out, and dressed from the bottom with stimulating applications, so that it may fill with healthy granulations. JIaligxaxt Disease or Bone.—Up to a very recent period, various tumoiu’s grovung from the long bones and having certain com- mon characteristics, such as extreme rapidity of growth, a tendency to pulpy degeneration, and to sprouting fungus, were looked upon as cases of cancer of bone, and were variously described under the terms of osteo-cancer, osteo-cephaloma, &c. More recent pathological observations have, however, throivn much doubt on the correctness of this ^uew of the real nature of these very formidable tumom’s. And if the opinion be correct that true cancer can only be developed in connection with epithelial surfaces, we must discard the possibility of the existence of such a disease as primary cancer of bone. Virchow, indeed, refers most of the tumours that were formerly considered typical of this affection to the various classes of fibromata and sarcomata (Vol. I., p. 751). It would only be in such bones as the superior maxilla, and those generally in connection vuth the mucous membrane lining the cavities of the face, that true cancer could develop itself; and even here the osseous tissue would only be involved secondarily, and not be attacked as the primary seat of the disease. As these tumoiu’s of bone that have generally, though probably erroneously, been considered to be cancers, present many characters of malignancy, and as their true anatomical structure may in many cases still be somewhat uncertain, I shall in this chapter speak of them from their clinical rather than from a histological point of view ; and instead of attempting to arrange them into the Fit . 42S.—Cells from Siiindlo-oelleil Sarcoma Tumoiu' of Scapula : First recurrence.STRUCTURAL CHANGES IN BONE. 204 various groups to which they pathologically belong, class them together under the one general broad designation of Malignant Tumours of Bone. Two distinct forms of malignant timrour of bone are met ■with. In one form the morbid growth is central, springing from the medullaiy canal; in the other it is peripheral, being only attached to the compact osseous substance. In the central malignant disease of bone, the tumour is found to gi’ow in the substance of, or to spring from, the interior of the medullary canal. It is usually situated at or about the articular ends, expanding the bone, which becomes completely enveloped and incoi'porated in the structm-e of the growth, either in the form of osseous rays diverging from the centre of the tumour, or more rarely as a thin shell of bone siUTOimding the mass, as in the more simple growths springing fr-om this tissue. In either circumstance, it is important to bear in mind, this form of disease is never locahsed, but always invades the whole of the bone. The freedom of communication between the upper and lower ends of a long bone is so great, that, as has been sho^Yn by Richet, water injected at one end exudes in a few seconds at the other ; hence the juices of a malignant structm’e may easily traverse the whole length of the bone, and we accordingly find, on examining the osseous tissue at a distance from the tmnour, that there are red patches in it here and there indicative of its infiltration vith the morbid structme. These central mahgnant tumoms of bone are in most cases sai’comata, or rapidly growing and soft enchondromata.

Siiontaueoua Fracture.2o6 STRUCTURAL CHANGES IN BONE. luid occasion to verify, that, although the epiphysis may have been completely degenerated, the cartilage of incrustation and of the neighbouring joint (Fig. 432) never becomes implicated; although the growth may eventually involve and include the whole of the rest of the articulation, by extension to the capsule and its soft parts. When internal organs become secondarily affected in these cases, the deposit will generally be found in the lungs. Symptoms.—There is usually, with much lancinating pain, a rapidly growing enlargement of the bone, having a globular shape, feehng elastic, and some- times semi-fluctuating. The skin covering it, at flrst pale, with numerous reticulated and blue tortuous veins, afterwards becomes discoloured, being even- tually implicated in the morbid mass. In some cases fracture of the bone takes place at the affected part (Figs. 431, 433, 434); the neighbouring tissues are speedily contaminated, the lymphatic glands become enlarged, cancerous cachexy supervenes, and the patient eventually sinks. In other cases, the disease being central, the progress, especially in the early stages of the disease, is less rapid, though it at last developes itself with fearful violence. So long as the disease is confined within the walls of the bone, it developes itself but slowly, and does not show much disposition to affect the constitution. Some years ago I had under my care a man whose thigh I amputated for mafignant disease of the head of the tibia ; the disease had existed for foiu years, eucap- suled, as it were, inside the head of the bone, without contaminating the neighbouring pai’ts. The patient’s constitution appeared soimd, and he made a good recovery. But, Avhen once the soft parts become engaged, the system is speedily contaminated. In some instances pulsation of a thi’iUiug kind, with or without a blowing murmur, is distinctly perceptible, especially in an advanced stage of the affection, when the vascularity of the tumour is gveatly increased. Diagnosis.—The diagnosis of malignant disease has to be made from other timioiu’s of bone, and fr’om aneurism. The malignant growths of bone may readily be confounded with those various forms of non-malignant disease that are commonly included under the term spina ventosa. In making the dia- gnosis, we may reasonably come to the conclusion that the growth is mahgnant, if it occur in early life before puberty, or between this period and the early adult age ; if it increase with great rapidity, and with much pain, especially of a lancinating character ; if, to the touch, it present a somewhat diffused pulpi- ness, with much elasticity, great tension, and, at points, a semi-fluctuating feel; and more especially if the veins be greatly enlarged and tortuous, the neigh- bouring lymphatic glands involved, and if cachexy ultimately set in. These conditions, differing from the slow growth, the more circumscribed character, and more soM feel of the non-malignant tumours, which have no tendency to the implication of neighbouring structuros, and which occiu at later periods of life, usually enable us to make the diagnosis. There is one tumour, how- ever, viz., enchondroma, which occasionally, in the rapidity of its growth, closely resembles malignant disease. Here the diagnosis is confessedly ex- tremely difficult ; though the more solid character, the less degree of elasticity, and the absence of lymphatic enlargement or implication of contiguous tissues, will often enable us to establish the .true nature of a tumour before its removal.207 treatment of malignant disease. 207 Dsis from aneurism is necessarily unattended by any difficulty Treatment.—No means ai-e of any avail in cases of malignant disease of bone. except the removal of the diseased part by amputation or excision. These operations ai-e, however, not very promising, as there are few forms of malignant tumour in which the disease retmms more rapidly in a secondary manner than in that of the bones. The rapidity of recuiTence wiU, however, greatly depend upon the form of the disease, or the time when aminitatim is perfoiTued, and on the part where it is practised. Amputation should always, if possible, be performed in the earliest stage of the disease, befoi’e glandular or constitutional infection has set in. If the glands be enlarged, and cachexy have akeady occurred, little can be expected in the way of ultimate em’e : yet I have known cases in which, even in these unfavourable circumstances, the patients have made a good recovery, life ha^dng been prolonged for months. I believe that return is much more speedy and certain after amputation in the peripheral than in the central form of malignant disease of bone, provided that in the latter the whole of the bone has been removed ; this is due to the more ex- tensi^-e contamination of the soft parts in the former than in the latter case. The selection of the line at which amputation should be performed is of great importance, and the result wiU materially depend upon the judgment displayed in this. If the limb be removed in the continuity of the diseased bone, there must necessarily be a great probability of a very rapid return of the morbid action in the stump ; and this probability amounts to a certainty in those cases in which the disease is central, and in which the whole of the medullary canal and cancellous structure are implicated, and infiltrated with cancer. In cases of peripheral disease, this return in the same bone may not take place ; indeed, I have seen one case of the kind in which the disease affected the lower end of the tibia, and that bone was amputated in its upper third ; in this case, after a lapse of some months, fatal recurrence of the disease took place in the pelvic bones, but not in the stump. As, however, the peripheral is more rare than the central form of the disease, and as there are no means of ascertaining the precise kind before removal, the rule, I tliiuk, should be definite to amputate at or above the next joint—at the hip-joint, in malignant disease of the fennu’; in the thigh, for that of the bones of the leg ; and at the shoulder, when the upper arm is affected. When the lower part of the femur, however, is involved, amputation through the trochanters may sometimes be substituted for disarticulation at the hip-joint, the latter operation being so formidable and so fatal that the Surgeon may think itSTRUCTUllAL CHANGES IN BONE. 2o8 advisable not to subject the patient to so serious a risk ; or amputation might be performed through the trochanters, and then tlie head of the Imne extir- pated from the acetabulum. In this -vvay the severity of the operation and the extent of incised surface would be lessened, whilst the whole of the diseased bone would be removed. In some forms of malignant bone-disease, however, the muscles inserted into the aftccted bone become speedily contaminated, and this contamination may spread wdely through the substance or along the sheath of any particular muscle. Hence I think the rule in these cases should be to amputate not only above the diseased bone, but, if practicable, above the origins of the muscles in the neighboiu'hood of the disease : thus, if there be a malignant tumour of the bones of the forearm, amputation should be done not only above the elbow-joint, but above the humeral attachments of the muscles of the forearm. The propriety of excision of some bones, as of those of the face, in this disease, must depend on whether the morbid deposit is limited to the structures that can be excised. This operation can rarely be advantageously practised in malignant tumom'S, there being in general too great an impheation of the soft structm-es in the neighbourhood to justify it. SANGumEOUs Tumours are occasionally met with in bones. Stanley describes them as appearing imder two forms :—1. As tumoiu’s composed of a vascular substance, having the general characters of erectile tissue, and Fig. 435.^—.Viieui'isiii by Anastomosis of one of the Parietal Bones. bearing on section a close resemblance to certain nsevi (Fig. 43f)) ; tumours of this kind may be removed without the hability to reiwoduction : 2. As cysts formed in the cancellous structure of a bone, and containing either fluid or coagulated blood. According to Stanley, these tumours expand the osseous walls, and gradually cause ulceration of the skin and profuse InemoiThage. The Treatment cofisists in the amputation of the limb, or the excision of the affected bone, as was successfully done by Travers, who removed a clavicle that was the seat of this disease. OsTEo-Aneurism.—Fulsalhnj Tumours of Bone, or Osteo-Aneurisms, thougn of unfr-equent occurrence, are of considerable importance to the practical Sur- geon, on account of the difficulty that often exists in establisliing a diagnosis209 SYMPTOMS OF OSTEO-AXFUIUSM. bct^veen them and ordinary aneurisms. It is only of late years that this kind of disease has been fully reeognised ; and it is principally to the labours of llandysidc, Xelaton, Stanley, and lioux that we owe an acquaintance with its Tumom-s springing from bone, whether of a cartilaginous, fibrous, or cystic character, may have pulsation communicated to them from a neighbouring artery; but the true pulsating tumours of bone owe them pulsations to some inherent peculiarity of structure, which appears to consist either in the development of a vascular tissue of abnormal character, or else in the simple enlargement and dilatation of the vessels of the bone. In the former and more fr’equent class of cases, those in which a new tissue is deve- loped in the osseous structure, we usually find the tumour to partake of the character of malignant growth ; a creamy, curdy, or brain-like, soft, and very vascular mass is formed as an essential and principal constituent of it. This form of disease has been termed an encephalo-osteo-aneurism. This abnormal mass will be found to present every shade of transition, from true malignant growth to a purely vascular tissue of an erectile character. Billroth has described a somewhat similar condition as occuiTing in sarco- matous tumours of the bones of the lower extremity, in which numerous small anem'ismal dilatations existed on the vessels, forming a network through- out the mass. In the second and rarer form of the disease, there is developed in the bone a structure, which originally, and in many cases throughout, is a vascTilar erectile growth, closely resembhng capillary naevus in its structiu’e, composed of an infinity of blood-vessels, interlacing in every possible way, so as to form a soft reddish-yellow tumoiu’. In a third form, a hoUow cavity is fomed in the bone, scooped out of the cancellous structure and filled with blood, partly liquid and partly coagulated, and having arterial branches freely opening into it. The shell of bone sm-rounding this cavity is very thin and expanded, being usually absorbed at one point, where it often becomes at last perforated. This constitutes the true aneurism of bone. Situation.—These various kinds of pulsatory tumour of bone have been met with in almost aU parts of the body; most comuionly the cancellous articular ends of the long bones, more particularly of the tibia, the radius, the humerus, and the femur, have been found affected. The pelvic bones are also not unfrcquently the seats of these growths ; and they have been encountered in the skull and the ribs. Sijmpioms.—In its early symptoms an osteo-aneurism closely resembles the ordinary fonns of spina ventosa, being oval in shape, uniform, and elastic to the touch, growing slowly, without enlargement of the veins or discoloration of the skin ; these characters it possesses in common with most other tumours of bone. The special signs by which it is characterised, hoAvever, are its pulsation and bniit: the pulsation is very distinct, superficial, and commonly of a thrilhng character ; in other cases it is directly impulsive, and distinctly expansile ; the bruit is most usually soft and blowing, but not uiifrequently harsh, loud, and whizzing. In some cases the bruit is absent, though the pulsation continue distinct; this, according to Nclaton, is most frequently the case in tine osteo-aneurism. In the pulsating malignant form of the disease, I have heard the bruit peculiarly loud, rough, and superficial. On compressing VOL. II.STRUCTURAL CHANGES IN RONE. 210 the mam artery leading to the part of the limb in Avhich the tumour is situated, all movement and bruit commonly cease in it, and the tumour lessens in size. By pressing upon the growth when it is thus diminished It will commonly bo found to have a bony margin, with a central depression more especially in those cases in which there is no malignant gTowth entering into its composition, the gTowth being apparently composed of erectile and expanded osseous tissue, filled with fluid blood. In some cases, however the tumour is fed by several arterial branches, which may be felt distinctly pulsating under the skin. This is more particularly the case when it occurs upon the bones of the pelvis and the scapula, and then the bruit and pul- sation cannot be made to cease in it. All these signs are commonly some- vhat inteimittent, appearing perhaps in the earlier stages of the disease, and disappeaiing as it advances; oi’ the reverse may occur, the pulsation and hruit becoming distinct as the disease increases in size, and meets with more resistance in its outward growth. Diagnosis.—It is of considerable importance in many cases to diagnose the different forms of pulsating tumour of bone from one another ; some being of a truly mah’gnant character, whilst others appear to consist of shnple expansion of the vascular element of the bone, with atrophy of its osseous substance ; and consequently the prognosis also in the two conditions is very different. The true osteo-aneurism has so many signs in common with the gmlsaiwg malignant tumour of bone, that in many cases it is almost impossible to effect the diagnosis ; yet it is well to bear in mind that the mahgnant form of the disease is not imfi-equently multiple, occurring, with pulsation and bruit, in more situations than one : thus I have seen growths of this kind, with their signs well marked, springing both from the pelvis and from the rihs. The true osteo-aneurism is met with only in the articular ends of long bones ; whereas the malignant disease, though commonly occurring in these situations, is also frequently fomid in other parts of the body. Besides these, there are two conditions which, in many cases, will enable the Surgeon to determine that the pulsating tumom* is an osseous aneiuism: \dz., the absence of all bruit, though the pulsation be distinct, and the detection by Arm pressiue, after the tumour has been diminished by comj>ressing the artery leading to it, of an osseous margin around its depressed centre. From ordinary aneurism the diagnosis of osteo-aneurism is, in many cases, attended by almost insuperable difficulties. So great are these, that there are many cases on record in which the most experienced Sm-geons have ligatured arteries for tumoius that were supposed to be aneurismal, but which have turned out to be pulsating growths connected with bone. A principal point to be attended to in effecting the diagnosis is the situation of the tumour, which may occur away from the ordinary sites of aneurism, in parts of the body where there is no vessel large enough to give rise to such a disease—as, for instance, about the head of the fibula or the side of the pelvis. Then, again, its incorporation with the subjacent bone, the want of a distinctly limited and circumscribed outline, and the existence in many cases of plates of bone in the wall of the tumour—giving rise perhaps, on pressure, to the peculiar rustling or crackling sound cliaracteristic of expansive bony growths —^vill enable the Surgeon to come to a conclusion as to the true natine of tlieTREATMENT OF OSTEO-ANEURISM. Ill this he M-ill be fui-ther cassisted by its giving on compression a , flm-ivession surrounded by an \ doubted that, when tumours of tliis kind occur m some ot the ordinary . situations of aneurism, as about the brim of the pehds, and in the popliteal space, the diagnosis is surrounded with difficulties which no amount of surgical skill or tact may be able to overcome. From ordinary tumours of lone, the existence of pulsation and bruit lull always suffice to distinguish the growths under consideration. Treatment.—Incision into a pulsating tumour of bone, or any attempt to^ i-emove it without its osseous connections, is clearly contrary to the. rules ot good surgery; and when it has been practised, the haemorrhage has been of the most alarming and dangerous character. Resection has been had recoiuse ' to in some instances, as when the disease has been seated on the cranial bones, but without success. Liston, in a tumom of this kind growing from the scapula, which he called “ an ossified aneurismal tumour of the subscapular artery, “excised the greater portion of the bone from which it sprang ; but fungous growths reappeai’ed in the wound, by which the patient was at last exhausted. When the disease has proceeded to such an extent as to produce extensive alteration in, and destruction of, the tissue of the bone affected, amjputahon of the limb is the only resource left to the Surgeon. This operation is also called for in those cases in which the disease retinns after other means, such as the liyature of the artery, have been practised. In these cases, if the disease partake at all of the malignant character, the limb must be removed at a point above the affected bone. The result of ligature of the main artery leading to the tumour depends .greatly upon the nature of the growth. When it is partly composed of sarco- matous or other solid tissue, but little good can result from this proceeding— the tumour continuing to increase by an inherent growth, which will continue as long as the vitality of the limb is maintained ; and we accordingly find that, in all such cases in which this operation has been practised, the progi’ess of the tumour has either not been retarded, or, if the pulsations have been stopped and its size lessened for a time, the activity of the symptoms has speedily re- turned, and amputation has been rendered necessary. When, however, the tumour has partaken more of the characters of true osteo-aneurism, then a more favourable result has followed the ligature of the main artery of the limb. In a case of this kind seated in the radius, in Avhich Roux ligatured the brachial artery, a complete cure resulted. The same also occurred to Lallemand ; and in a patient of Dupuytren’s there was no return of the disease for six years, when it recim-ed, and amputation became necessary. These results arc suf- ficiently satisfactory to justify the Surgeon in having recourse to the ligature, or perhaps the compression, of the main artery of the limb, in those cases in which the tumour can be ascertained not to partake of the nature of malig- nant growth.DISEASES OF JOINTS. 2 12 CHAPTER XLYIII. DISEASES OF JOIXTS. The various joints of the body may become the seat of Inflammatoiy Affec- tions of an acute or chronic character; of Strumous Disease ; or of various, other morbid conditions, such as more or less permanent rigidity, or Ankylosis,, the formation of Foreign Bodies vithin their ca^dties, or their Malignant Degeneration, and Xeuralgia. In studying these various articular affections, it must be borne in mind that a joint is composed of a nmnber of different tissues; of synoA’ial membrane, cartilage, ligament, bone, and capsule, or investing fibrous- expansion. In any one of these structures the disease may primarily begin,, though eventually the morbid action often spreads to other tissues besides that which was originally involved. The merit of having been the fii-st to point out the true mode of studying these affections in reference to the different structiu’es. in which they have originated, and to ha's'e set aside that coarse pathology which, under the general terms of “ arthritis ” and of “ white swelling,” con- founded together these ’^•arious diseases, is certainly due to Sir Benjamin Brodie. SYNOVITIS. Inffamuiatioii of tlie Synovial Membrane, the most common perhaps of all the articular affections, may be acute, subacute, or clironic. Causes.—Whatever form it assumes, synovitis usually results from exposme to cold, especially in rheimiatic or syphilitic constitutions. In these cases it commonly happens that more joints than one are implicated at the same time; and the affected articulations are more frequently those that are most exposed by having the thinnest covering of soft parts, and by being especially subjected to transitions of temperature, such as the knees and ankles. Injuries of joints, as blows, bruises, wounds, or sprains, will also frequently occasion this inflam- mation ; but when arising from such causes, it is usually associated with inflammation of the other textures of the articulation. Pathology.—As imcomplicated acute synoAutis is never fatal, we seldom have an opportunity of studying its pathology. It would, however, appear from the examination of joints in cases of synovitis from injury, as well as from the experiments of iliehet. Bonnet, and others, who have induced trau- matic syno^dtis in animals, that there is in the first instance an mflammatory congestion and vascularity of the membrane, with loss of its peculiar satiny polish.

In purulent synovitis from pyiemia, it is indeed almost cutaneous. On laying the hand on the joint, this vill be felt to ^^The sivellinfj of the affected joint is considerable, and evidently depends on accumulation of fluid ivithin the synovial sac, the extreme oifflme of which is rendered apparent by the tension to which it is subjected. Thus in the knee it rises up high in the thigh under the tendon of the quadriceps extensoi, to the extent of°three or four inches above the upper border of the patella, the swelliug being higher on the inner than the outer side of the hmb, whilst in the elbow it rises in the same manner under the tendon of the triceps. There is but little if auy effusion into the surrounding tissues ; and hence the out- line of the joint can be distinctly felt, and undulcLtion perceived in it. The limb is usually semiflexed, as giving the patient most ease, and the joint cannot be moved. The constitutional febrile disturbance is tolerably severe, especially if the affection occim in a rheumatic constitution. Chronic Synovitis.—The disease, at first acute, may terminate in a sub- acute or chronic form ; or, subacute at its commencement, it may fall into a chronic condition. Chronic synoifitis is characterised by all the symptoms of the acute variety of the disease, but in a less severe degree. The swelling and weakness of the joint are the most conspicuous local conditions. In some cases, the swelling from accumidated serous fluid is so considerable as to consti- tute a true dropsy of the joint—Hydrarthrosis. This accumulation of fluid, partaking in various degTees of the characters of serum and synovia, is usually preceded or accompanied by evidence of synovial inflammation ; but, though this generally happens, it is not invariably the case. Richet, in paidicular, has recorded instances from which it would appear that inflammation is not a ncccssaiy or invariable accompaniment of the affection, the synovial mem- brane being indeed pretcniaturaUy ivliite, and looking as if it had been washed or soddened ; and though these cases are rare, those that commonly present themselves to the Surgeon being of a decidedly inflammatory character, yet their occasional occun-ence is sufficient to establish the existence of a passive, as well as of an inflammatory form of the disease. The presence of an abnormal quantity of fluid in the joint is always readily perceived by its fluctuation and undulation and by the ])ecuUar shape that it214 DISEASES OF JOINTS. coiumimicatcs to the part. Thus in the knee, which is the nrost common seat of this affection, the patella will he felt to float, as it were, on the subjacent liquid ; and the capsule of the joint projects distinctly in three situations, viz.,, on each side of the ligamentum patellte, and above that bone. In the elbow, there is a soft and fluctuating swelling on each side of the olecranon, and under the tendon of the triceps ; and in the shoulder there is a general round- ness and distension of the articulation. It is said that, in some cases, the distension of the joint has been so gveat that the synovial membrane has been riqjtured, and the fluid pormed forth into the siuTOunding areolar tissue. In theso»cascs, however, it is probable that some destructive change in the sjmovial membrane preceded its rupture. In some cases of chronic synovitis distinct crachUnf/ wiU be felt in thc' interior of thc joint, on laying the hand over the articulation whilst it is freely moved. This appears to me to be due to the existence of plastic bands or deposits in the interior of the joint, through which the fluid is pressed by the- articular movements, and thus occasions the sensation which is met with under other but similar circumstances in enlargements of the bimsje, and in fluid ■ effusions in the sheaths of tendons. TEmiiXATiONS.—The termination of synovitis will depend mainly on its cause. IITien simple and uncomplicated, arising as the result, perhaps, of rheumatic influences, it will in most cases terminate in complete resolution. In other instances, however, plastic matter may be throvTi out, which either assumes the form of warty vegetations or concretions within the joint, or of bands stretching across its interior or incorporated with its capsule, occasion- ing more or less permanent stiffness, '\^^len synovitis arises from wound, it usually goes on to suppuration vdthiu the joint, with superficial erosion or disintegi’ation of the cartilage, and eventually, if the limb be not removed, to complete disorganisation of the interior of the articulation, and to more or less complete ankylosis. The same happens in the puei’peral and pytemic inflammations of joints ; in which cases the morbid action commencing on the synovial membrane extends downwards to the cartilages, eventually destroying them. The chronic or subacute synovitis and hydrarthrosis usually terminate favom’ably, although the joint is generally left in a weak, relaxed condition, w'hich may take many months to recover ; but occasionally, more particularly in striunous constitutions, the disease runs on to suppurative destruction of the joint. This, however, is rare ; yet its occurrence, in some instances, should make the Surgeon careful not to confound the fluctuation of serous accimnda- tion with that of piu’ulent collection. In the latter instances, the symptoms of inflammation vdll always have preceded. Treatment.—The treatment of synovitis depends partly on the seventy ot the symptoms, and partly on the cause of the disease. If a joint have been injured, and syno'vitis be apprehended, or indeed ha'S'e commenced, no tieat- ment will be found more efficacious than the continued application of ice in India-rubber bags of sufficient size to envelope the whole of the joint. In this way the inflammation may often be checked or completely arrested, t le joint being, of course, kept at the same time perfectly at rest on a sphnt or in a sling. Should thc disease have made progress, and should the ice iail in215 TREATMENT OF HYDRARTHROSIS. aiTOsting it, then, if the patient be young and strong, the free and repeated application of leeches to the inflamed articulation, followed by fomentations and accompanied by perfect rest of the part on a splint, or on pillows properly an-anged, will be the most useful treatment. At the same time, saline purga'tivcs with antimony must be giyen, and the patient kept on a low the disease be rlmmaiic, leeches must be applied, followed by hot fomen- tations, and rest of the part in the elevated position : at the same time col- chiciim, udth salines, if there be much febrile distm-bance, and in combination with Dover’s powder, if there be much pain at night, should be administered. In some instances, where colchicum disagrees, great benefit will result from the administration of Dover’s powder and calomel, in small but frequent doses. When the disease is of sijjMitic origin, leeches are not often required ; but the application of blisters, followed by calomel and opiimi, will be attended with marked success. IVheii the syno’sitis is suhacute or chronic, the same principles of treatment must be adopted, modified according to the intensity of the affection. In these forms of the disease, rest is perhaps the most important element in the treat- ment, eveiything else proving nugatory unless this be attended to ; the limb is usually best fixed by leather splints, buckled on so that they may be removed in order to make the necessary applications to it. In these cases, repeated bhsterings over the whole of the joint constitute perhaps the most useful local means that we possess : in a more advanced stage, counter-irritation by means of stimulating embrocations, together with douches, either of warm sea-water or of some of the sulphiu’ous springs, such as those of Aix or Bareges, Avill prove most useful; and when aU infiammatory action has been subdued, and weakness of the joint merely is left, the joint should be properly strapped with soap-plaster, spread upon leather. Amongst the internal remedies likely to be of most service, may be mentioned the iodide of potassium, either alone or in some bitter uifusion. In hydrarthrosis, rest and repeated blistering will usually promote the removal of the fluid. In addition to this, the employment of pressure and friction, with absorbent remedies, as the iodine or mercurial ointment or oleate of mercury conjoined with the internal administration of the iodide of potassium or a mild mercimal course, will often procime the absorption of the fluid. If these means fail, the pneumatic aspirator may be used to empty the joint of its fluid, the puncture being closed antiseptically, and in extreme cases we have a very powerfrd method of cure at our command in the in- jection of the joint with tincture of iodine. This plan, a sufficiently bold one, has been much employed by Jobert, Velpeau, and Bonnet. These burgeons used the tincture diluted with two or three parts of water. A small trochar is introduced into the joint, a moderate quantity of the serous fluid is let out, but not all, and then a corresponding quantity of the iodine solution IS thrown in ; and after being left for a few minutes, is allowed to escape. Inflammation of the joint, which is a necessary result of this pro- cedure, comes on. This is then treated by ordinary .antiphlogistic means, and, accoiding to the statements of the French Surgeons, has in no case been followed by any serious consequences, but in several instances by a completeDISEASES OF JOINTS. cure without ankylosis ; a new and healthy aetion having been imprinted on the synovial membrane. This mode of treatment does not appear hitherto to have met with mueh support in this country ; yet it certainly deserves a ! trial, though reeoursc should not lightly be had to it, as it is evident that the i induced inflammation might exceed the expected limits. In one case of hydrar- throsis of the knee, in an old man, in which I employed it, about six ounces ol thin s}movia were drawn off, and a drachm of strong tincture of iodine was injected into the joint. Shght inflammation only ensued ; and the disease, which was of two years’ standing, was completely cured. The chief points that appear to require attention are that no inflammation be going on at the time, there being no tenderness or pain in mo'i’ing the joint, the effusion being quite passive, and of a very chronic character ; and, above all, that no air be allowed to enter with the injected fluid. After di’opsy of the joint has been removed, the articulation is usually left weak for some length of time, in consequence of the stretching to which its ligaments have been subjected: here cold douches and an elastic bandage will constitute the best mode of treatment. ARTHRITIS. Simple, Acute, and Chronic Arthritis.—By Arthritis, in its simple form, is meant inflammatory disease of an acute or chronic kind of the whole or gTeater part of the structures that enter into the formation of a joint. This affection may conmience in the synovial mmnlranes, and then sjiread to the other articular tissues ; or it may begin in the cariilayes or lo7ics. Diseased action is very seldom primarily set up in the liyaments of the joint; though these structures commonly become elongated, softened, and destroyed, as a consequence of other forms of articular disease. But, though primary inflammation of the ligaments is so rare an affection as to have been denied by many, yet it certainly does occasionally occiu’. This is especially seen in the hip-joint, where the inflammatory affection may commence in the round hgament; illustrative of which there is a very beautiful model in the University CoUege Museum. Inflammation may commence in the Jibrous capsule of the joint: this we find more particularly to be the case when the affection is of a rheumatic character ; in these cases inflammation, nmning into suppuration and slough of this structure, vdll commonly spread to the internal parts. In some instances this form of disease gives rise to the deposition of masses and layers of bone in the areolar structines outside the articulation. Causes.—In some instances, acute necrosis of the shaft of one of the long bones, as of the tibia, will extend to the epiphysis, and thus run on to destructive action in the terminal articulations, the cartilages becoming imder- mined, softened, and perforated. It not unfrequently happens that the arthritic disease is a result of a ntorbid condition of the ariicubxr ends of the long bones, or of those short bones that enter into the formation of the joint; this we especially see in diseases of the foot, of the elbow, of the knee, and hip ; but it is a condition which, I believe, may occur in any joint. The bones usually become, in the first instance, the seat of tuberculous infiltration; this runs into imhealthy suppuration, ivhich gives rise to caries and limited necrosis217 CAUSES OF ARTHRITIS. bcino- arrested or modified hy the morbid state of the subjacent bone. 'When once the eai'tilage becomes affected, the nmole ■of the interior of the joint speedily sup- purates, and is destroyed. In other cases, inflammatory congestion, but without the formation of tuberculous matter, takes place in the articular ends, which become somewhat expanded ; and then, without any suppuration occurring in the osseous structiu’e, the cartilage gradually sepa- rates or peels off’, and becomes softened and necrosed. This condition is often met Avith in disease of the tarsal articula- tions. Fi''. -tliO.—«, Caries of Head of Tibia: 6, Perforation of Cartilage. Al’thritis commonly results from luoiuuls of joints or 'injuries, such as sprains and iVactm-es occuiTing in their vicinity, more particularly in young people and in those of a lymphatic constitution. It also occurs as a not mifrequent accompaniment of pijce'nin (Vol. I. pp. 716, 121 \ and of some of the morbid conditions of the puerperal state. The puerperal infiammation of joints is of a very destructive character, most generally speedily terminating in suppurative disorganisation. One or several joints may be affected, and the knee is the one that is most frequently and seriously involved. Puerperal arthritis probably depends upon a purulent infection of the blood, the result of uterine jrhleljitis. Arthritis not unfrequently occurs as a consequence of scarlatina; the knee-joint is often affected in a destructive manner after this disease. In some forms of albuminuria there is also a great tendency to inflammation of the joints ; and, indeed, I have so frequently seen that form of renal dropsy Avhich follows scarlet fever accompanied by serious, sometimes destructive, inflammation of some joint, as almost to look upon one condition as the .sequence of the other. Acute Arthritis of a single large joint is never rheumatic. In rheumatism more joints than one are always affected. Where one single joint, such as the knee, is attacked by disorganising inflammation, the disease arises from one of three diseases, viz., struma, pyaemia, or gonon’hoea. When strumous, it Avill usually partake of the character of white SAvelling, or commence in the osseous articular ends. When commencing in the synoAual membrane and confined to the soft articular structures, it will be found (when not tramnatic) to be either pyaemic—possibly in women puerperal—or gonoiThocal. In either case the prognosis is bad—in the first to life, in the last to the joint. In old people, acute disorganising arthritis is occasionally set up Avithout any injury or other extcnial exciting cause. I have in this Avay seen the joints of the foot, the ankle, and the stcnio-clavicular articulation rapidly destroyed, Avith great local inflammatory excitement and severe constitutional distiu-banceDISEASES OF JOINTS. 2i8 of a low form. These attacks are often mistaken in the first instance for gout; but the rapidity of the disorganising action, the formation of pus within and around the joint, the necrosis of the contiguous bones, and the separation of the mcrusting cartilages, all indicate the different nature of this affection ; which, so far as the joint itself is concerned, is incurable, and which may terminate in the loss of the jDatient’s life. The symptoms of arthi-itis that are most marked are the pain, heat, swelling, and peculiar position of the joint. The is often severe' tensi's e, and throbbing : so acute is it sometimes, that the patient screams with agony ; he cannot bear the bed to be touched, the room to be shaken, or the slightest mo'vement communicated to the limb, any attempt at examination of joint in such cases being attended with insupportable agony. There are usually nocturnal 'exacerbations, and the pain is commonly refeiTed with especial severity to one particular spot in the joint ; thus it is generally felt at the inner or under side of the knee-joint, and at the outer asjDect of the hip. The heat of the diseased joint is considerable, and is often accompanied with more or less superficial redness. The sweWmg is uniform, in^'olving the Avhole of the articulation, and not projecting at certain parts of it, as when the synovial membrane alone is affected ; it is generally not very considerable, and has a soft and doughy, rather than a fluctuating feel. As the disease advances, however, the swelling generally increases suddenly, and to a consider- able extent, either in consequence of the irritation of the synovial membrane, or of the accumulation of pus within or ai'ound the joint. In many cases the synovial membrane gives way, and the pus from the interiorof the joint becomes vddely diffused through the muscular interspaces of the limb, forming enormous abscesses and long sinuous tracts. The position of the affectedjimb is peculiar, and that attitude is insensibly adopted in which the patient will have the greatest amount of ease ; thus the knee is semiflexed and turned outwards, the thigh is abducted, and the elbow is bent. Sjoasms or startings of the limb, often of a very sharp and painful character, come on at times ; more particularly at night. Amongst the most distressing symptoms in the more ad^-anced stages of acute disorganisation of a joint are the painful startings of the limb when- ever the patient falls to sleep. The muscles becoming relaxed the softened articular structm'es allow the joint to become slightly displaced ; a reflex con- traction of the muscles immediately takes place aud the patient wakes with a painful spasmodic jerk of the limb, inducing a feeling of alarm, that is often very distressing. The constitutional clisturhance is very severe, and of an actiA'ely febrile type. As the disease progresses, suppuration takes place within the joint, which becomes hot and red, with a good deal of throbbing pain, and at last fluctuation is perceived where the coverings are thinned. In some cases the suppiwation occurs with very great rapidity, and luxation of the head of the bone takes place. In other cases the synovial membrane and capsule of the joint give Avay Avithout any looseness of ligaments or displacement ot bones, pus becomes infiltrated into the areolar tissue around the joint, an abscess forms externally to the articulation, and extensive purulent collections become diffused through the limb. As the joint becomes loosened by the destruction of its ligaments, the bones become mobile, and grate against one another Avhere the incrustingSYMPTOMS OF APTJIFJTIS. 2 1 9 cartilage has been removed, thus giving rise to very severe suffering. ^ hums may, however, in some eases be very extensively destroyed and yet na 4tiuo- tLe place ; this is owing cither to the destructive action being limited to the°edge of the encrusting cartilage, the opposed surfaces being souncUr else to the interior of the articulation being filled up AVith plastic mattci attei ti rcmo\-al of the cartilages. But though abscess, either within the jomt oi external to it, usually forms when the lioiies grate and the cartilage disintc- orates yet it occasionally happens that these conditions take place—those symptoms that arc indicative of the erosion of the cartilage, such as painful startings of the limb, grating, and preternatin-al mobility of the joint—and yet no abscess forms ; aU the symptoms subsiding under proper treatment, and the joint recovering, though perhaps vdth a certain degree of ankylosis. But the reverse may also take place. Suppiu’ation may take place in a joint, either as the result of pytemia or of injmy, the synovial membrane and the capsule may give way, extensive infiltration of pus into the deep areolar planes of the limb may occur, and yet no laxity of ligament, no preternatural mobility of the bones, no grating of the osseous siu'face, indicate the disorganisation of the articulation which is in progress. This condition may occur in any joint ; I have most fi’equently met with it in the knee. There the upper and usually the outer part of the capsule generally gives Avay, and the pus diffuses itself deeply through the muscles of the limb, sometimes between the periosteum and the bone even. In these cases the thigh swells greatly, the limb becomes, cedematous, and a deep and obscure sensation of fluctuation may perhaps be felt,, more especially towards the outer and lower part of the limb just above the knee. The swelling of the joint has perhaps subsided, giving a false idea of security, which is confirmed by the absence of signs indicative of disorganisa- tion, such as lateral mobility and grating. But on pressing the thigh doAvn- wards, the joint wall be found to. fill, the patella AviU float again, and there is an evident commmiication betAveen the interior of the synovial membrane and the extensive diffused abscess in the thigh. In cases of this kind the pus Avill first come to the surface about two or three inches above and to the outer side- of the joint; and, on a free incision being made here, immense quantities may be let out. In these cases the fluctuation is often masked by the oedema of the limb, and by the thickness of the overlying mass of areolar tissue and muscle, and Avill require the closest examination and the most practised finger for its detection. After suppuration has taken place, the constitutional disturbance partakes of the irritative type, the patient suffering severe pain, and being Avorn out by Avant of rest. Hectic may occur, and death from exhaustion and irrita- tion, unless the diseased part be removed. In other and less severe cases it falls into a state of chronic thickening, perhaps Avith fistulous openings leading doAvnto the diseased structures ; and in some of the more favom-able instances the patient may recover, Avith a permanently rigid joint. There is occasionally, but A'cry rarely met AA'itli, a form of acute arthritis occiirring independently of any external cause, but dependent on disor- ganisation of the cai’tilages, apparently from simple loss of vitality, in old persons of feeble constitution. It resembles in this respect that form of senile necrosis of bones described at p. 177. In the senile arthritis noAV alluded to the pain is very acute, the enlargement of the joints cousideraI)lc,220 DISEASES OF JOINTS. tlio wasting of muscle rapid and great. Tlie constitutional disturbance is pro- portionately severe. The joint that it most frequently atlects is the knee. I have also seen it in the wrist. This form of arthritis must not be confounded with tlie dry rheumatic arthritis of old people. It differs from this form of the disease in the acuteness of its local symptoms, and the severity of the constitutional disturbance. On examining the joint after remo-s-al, the cartilages will be found to be ulcerated, the synodal membrane softened, swollen, and injected ; the ligaments softened, and the articular osseous ends ■\'ascular. The Treatment must be conducted on the ordinary principles of rest, fomentations, opiates, and supports. But at last, in order to save destruction of hfe by pain and exhaustion, the question of amputation vdll arise, and serious as this may be in old people, it will be the only alternative and chance of escape from a painful death. Diagnosis.—AJjscess may form externally to, but close upon, the capsule of a joint, and closely simulate disease of the articulation. In these cases the absence of serious constitutional disturbance, the irregularity of the swelling, gTeater on one side than the other, its extension over bony points, as the j^atella or olecranon, the superficial character of the fluctuation, the absence of all rigidity about the joint or of that preternatiu'al mobility in a horizontal direction which arises from softening of the ligaments, and of other severe local symptoms, such as pain, starting, looseness, or grating, will enable the Simgeon to effect a correct diagnosis. Pathology.—In arthritis, the principal changes are undoubtedly found to take place in the cartilages ; at the same time, it must not be supposed that all morbid appearances that are found in these structures are the result of inflam- mation, as erosion and absorption of their tissue may take place independently of any inflammatory action. The long-continued disuse of a joint, as in the treat- ment of fractures, may occasion this ; and in old people it is very common to meet Avith a porccUauous or ivory-like deposit on the articular ends of the bones, AA’hich, hoAA"eA*er, does not prevent the joints from being used, though it may occasion stiffness and pain in them. According to Quekett, this porcel- laiious deposit is of two kinds ; one consisting of imorganised earthy matter, the other of true bone having the HaA'ersian canals filled AAoth phosphate of lime. In acate arthritis, the cartilages are usually found nicerated and eroded in patches of varying size, exposing bone, AA'hich is rough and vascular. The remains of the cartilage are softened, inelastic, opaque, and thickened, and separate easily from the subjacent bone, which can be felt rough and grating. The synovial membrane is usually much thickened and very vascular; the A-ascularity being most distinct about those parts where the erosions and grooA’es in the cartilage are deepest, and often assuming a dentated or fringed appear- ance. In other parts, especially about the circumference of the joint, smooth and semi-transparent masses of plastic matter, having a somewhat fatty look, arc deposited underneath and upon the synovial membrane ; the ligaments are relaxed, vascular, and softened, and the interior of the filled Avith thin, flaky, and light-coloured pus. The capsule and the ceUular tissue around arc thickened, and cither infiltrated Avith pus oi c oggee aai i2 21 DISEASE OF CARTILAGE. the same kind of plastic matter that is seen in the interior of the joint. The articular end of the bone is enlarged, soft, and A’ascular; and m strumous cases may be the seat of tuberculous infiltration (Fig. 430). Nature of the Changes in Cartilage.—The changes that take place ni the cartilage in this disease have excited much attention amongst Surgeons, and a good deal of difference of opinion exists as to the mode in which they arc induced. Many Surgeons hold the doctrine that, cartilage being extrayas- cular, the changes that take place in it are accomplished through the medium of the contiguous sjmovial membrane or bone, and consequently are secondary to disease of these tissues. lYe may, I think, conclude that this disease of cartilage may arise in three Avays: 1, through the medium of the Synovial Membrane ; 2, through the medium of the subjacent Bone ; and, 3, by means of changes taking place in the Cartilage itself, 1. The destruction of cartilage, as the result of Sijnovial Disease, may best be studied iu cases of wound of a joint. In these cases it will be found, if the joint be examined before complete disorganisation of it has occurred, that the diseased action spreads from the free surface, where it is most intense, doAvnwards into the substance of the cartilage, which, superficially diseased, appeal’s more healthy the deeper the examination of it is caivied. Immediately under the sirollen, gelatinous-looking, brightly injected synovial membrane, the cartilage wiU be found to be reddened, roughened, and softened. On examining a thin slice of this, it will be found to be composed of granular matter and nuclei of cells whose Avails have disappeared. At a little greater depth than this it aaIII present an opaque matrix, with cells, some perfect, others imperfect or disintegrating ; and below this level Ave come to healthy white cartilage, Avith clear matrix, and weU-formed cells. The disorganisation of the cartilage wifi, eventually go on to its complete removal, and to the exposure of bare and roughened bone. It is in this way that destruction of joints, as the result of punctured wounds, pyaemia, or puerperal inflamma- tion, results. Aston Key adA'oeated the doctrine that a peculiar disease Avas set up in the synovial membrane, so as to form a fimbriated or fringed vascular network or tissue, by means of Avhich the cartilage Avas absorbed ; and that, as this mem- brane extended, so did the removal of the cartilage go on. That an appearance of this kind in inflamed joints is of common occmrence, is doubtless true; but Goodsir has attempted to prove that Key erred in attributing the disin- tegration of the cartilage to this membrane ; he states that a flbi’ous tissue forms in a diseased jouit as the result of the disintegration of the cartilage, and that this, Avhich is connected with either the synovial or the osseous siu’faces, speedily becomes A'ascular. >So far, therefore, from being the organ by which the cartilage is removed, it is the result of prior disease in this structure. At the same time it cannot be doubted, that an injected A'illous state of the synovial membrane does modify the nutrition of the subjacent cartilage in such a Avay that disintegration, erosion, and apparent ulceration of it Avill ensue ; and this vicAv is strongly supported by the researches of Billroth. 2. Disease of cartilage primarily dependent on Morh id Action in the Sidrjacent Done is, I believe, one of the most frequent modes of disorganisation of joints in strumous subjects, and most certainly leads to those rapidly destructiveDISEASES OF JOINTS. •affections of joints, in winch amputation or excision is recpiired. In these cases, either as tlie result of violence, or from constitutional causes, the articular ends of a bone, or the whole of a bone if it be one of the tarsal, becomes congested, inflamed, carious, or necrosed, sometimes infiltrated with ■cheesy matter. In consequence of this disorganisation of the osseous tissues, the incrusting cartilag-e becomes detached, its under or attached surface softened, and at last perforation takes place, as in a preceding cut (Fig. 43G i, p. 217), taken from the tibia of a boy whose limb I amputated for acute ■disorganisation of the knee-joint, following carious disease of the head of the tibia. This process of disintegration, and at last perforation and erosion of the cartilage, takes place in a direction fr-om below upwards. So soon as perforation occurs, the whole of the interior of the joint becomes acutely inflamed, and suppuration is set up in it, the ligaments loosen, and complete dis- organisation ensues (Fig. 437). On exam- ining the diseased patch or cartilage in cases of this kind, it null be found to cor- respond to the carious or tuberculous bone, from which it is separated by some bloody fluid ; it nail also be seen that the mider edges of the erosion or perforation in the car- tilages are separated to some extent from the subjacent bone, from which they readily peel off, and that they are bevelled off towards the aperture. 3. That cartilage is susceptible of Primary Change of the Nature of Inflammation or Ulceration, induced by the action of its own vessels, was the opinion of Brodie, Mayo, Fig. 4;!T.—Interior of Knee iiisorgiinisea Liston, all of whom had obsei'ved truG by Acute Pyannie Inflammation. • i- mi- i-i.- vascularisation of cartilage. This condition, however, is extremely rare, and is certainly not one of the more common forms of joint-disease, seldom occiUTing except in the more chi’onic stages of arthritis. While, however, inflammation, as the term is commonly understood, is of rare occuiTence as a primary change in a cartilage, certain of the accessory or constituent conditions of the process are liable to be met with in this tissue. The observations of Goodsir, of Eainey, and of Redfern, all point to the fact that cartilage, like other extravascular tissues, is subject to transformations, independent of the prolongation of vessels into it. The changes that ensue are, according to Rcdlern, ot the following kind. The caitilage-cells ciiLuge, become rounded, and granular-looking ; and, instead of theii containing tuo or three nuclei, a considerable number are enclosed in the cell-wall; eventually these corpuscles break up, and are disintegrated. Ihe matrix ot the caitilago noAV softens, and, according to Redfern, splits up into fibres or bands Avhich become nucleated. A species of tatty degeneration also, as pointed out by Rainey, takes place, and helps to soften and break down the structure of therepair of diseased joints. 223 onrtilao-e. In the more advanced stages of disease of cartilage, masses of porcellauous deposit are found attached to the ends of the bones in plates and layers takin"' the place of the eroded cartilage. ^ In other cases, a soft, pulpy, and vascular fibro-plastic deposit of a gi-eyis - ashy or reddish-brown colour, with whitish streaks of a firmer material running throiio-h it in various directions, takes the place of the cartilage that has been removed or that has undergone fibro-cellular degeneration. On examination under the microscope, this will be found to be composed of plastic material with ciu-tilage-corpiiscles intermixed, and with the subjacent bone in a state of disintegration and softening. This condition of joints I believe to be analogous to the “pulpy degeneration of the synovial membrane” of Brodie. It would appear, from the microscopical examinations that I have in various cases made of this material, to which my attention was first directed by Quain, as occuning in a patient of his whose elbow-joint I excised, that it is either fibro-cellular degeneration of the cartilage, or an imperfect attempt at repair set up in the articulation, after the removal of the cartilage by previous disintegration and disease. On making a vertical section of the surface of the diseased articula- tion in the case alluded to, it was found that the pulpy and 'b ilious substance ■covered the bone to the thickness of a line and more in some parts. The bone was found to have its cells filled with oil-globules, but surrounded by tolerably healthy osseous tissue, showing the usual laminm and bone-corpuscles. Xearer the diseased siuface the laminte and corpuscles became less distinct; and, still nearer, the cells of the bony tissue appeared to be surrounded merely by a layer of fibrous texture, in which iiTegular particles of bone were observed. These particles, which were elongated, irregular in form, and rounded off at the angles, were very aptly compared by Dr. Quain to crystals in a state of solution. At the diseased siuface, the place of the cartilage and synovial membrane was occupied by a fibrous texture abounding in cells, larger than pus-cells, nucleated and spherical, containing numerous granular particles. Irregular masses of •cartilage, undergoing the same process of softening as the bony particles already mentioned, appeared in this fibrous texture. The morbid appearances found in this case were so characteristic that they may be taken as the type of this peeuliar morbid condition, which I have since repeatedly met with in other articulations besides the elbow, more particularly those of the fingers and the knee, and which always, I believe, constitutes an inciuable form of disease. T have met with this condition in instances only in which the articular affection has been of very old standing, and has fallen into a truly chronic state. Repair.—When repair takes place in a joint, the cartilages of which have been eroded or destroyed, it is by the articular ends of the bones becoming connected, and the sm’face from which the cartilage has been removed filled up by fibro-cellular tissue, forming a kind of cicatricial material that leaves the joint permanently stiffened. In other cases porcellauous deposit takes the place of the eroded cartilage ; and, in some instances, the exposed osseous sur- faces may grow or become soldered together, forming a permanently ankylosed and immovable state of the articulation. In no circumstances does cartilage, when once destroyed, become regenerated. Ihe muscles in the neighbourhood of an inflamed joint undergo a species of •acute atrophy. The wasting and the flaccidity are both more than can beDISEASES OF JOINTS. 224 accounted for by simple disuse. The muscles chiefly alfccted arc those above the joint; the gluteals in coxalgia—those of the thigh in inflamed knee—those of the arm in affections of the elbow-joint. This acute atrophy of muscle occurs equally in cases of arthritis that arc non-suppurative, as in those in which pus is formed. It woidd appear as if the local afflux of blood was diverted towards the inflamed joint and the articular structures outside it, and that thus the nutrition of the capsular and neighbouring muscles was impaired, Trcalment.—lu the treatment of acuta arthritis, perfect rest of the articulation is of the first moment. Unless this be secured, no other treatment can be of any avail. The limb should be comfortably supported on piUows, or laid upon a well-made and softly padded leather splint, or slung in a cradle. But not only is rest, amounting to absolute unmovability of the joint, imperatively required as the first means of cure, but there is a second means M'hich is almost of equal importance, udth the view of removing pain, and preventing destruc- tive disorganisation of the articulation and consequent ankylosis,—I mean slight extension of the limb, so as to separate the articular surfaces very slightly from one another, and to prevent the excessive and agonising pain, that results partly ft-om the pressure of one inflamed articular surface against the other, by the semi-contraction of the muscles of the limb, partly ft-om the spasms that shake the limb and body from time to time, when the patient falls to sleep. These pains are not reheved entirely by simple rest and pressure—^more espe- cially that pain which results from the spasmodic action of the muscles of the limb : but they are usually at once removed by extension, by means of a Aveight attached to the loAver part of the limb. This is particularly the case in in- flammations of the hip and knee joints. It is in these cases that the weight- extending apparatus, combined with perfect rest, is so advantageous. The weight should be proportioned to the age of the patient. Its use will often at once relieve pain, and enable the sufferer to procure sleep. Fomentations and usual topical soothing treatment may be combined Avith these means. In the acute stage of the disease, the internal remedy from Avhich the most essential service may be derived is the calomel and opium pill (gr. ij. and gr. every fourth or sixth hour, at the same time that a strict antiphlogistic regimen is persevered in. After the Auolence of the symptoms has been subdued, and the disease has assumed a chronic suhacuie form, some modification must be made in the treatment. In this stage rest, absolute and immovable, is equally im- perative as in the acute stage. It may be secured in the same way. But in many cases I knoAV no more efficient method of steadying the inflamed joint than the application of the starched bandage, the limb haA’ing been previously enveloped in a thick layer of soft Avadding. The joint may be repeatedly blistered ; but in many instances most benefit Avill be deriA-ed from the appli- cation of the actual cautery. This agent, when properly applied, yields much more certain and successful results than any other form of counter-irritation with Avhich I am acquainted. The patient haA-ing been auKsthetised, a cauter- ising iron, heated to a black-red heat, should be rajAidly draAvn OA'er the diseased articulation in a series of parallel lines, across Avhich an equal niuAiber of cx’oss- bars are again draAvn, so as to char, Imt not destroy the true skin. A good deal of inflammatory action is thus set up, folloAved by slight suppuration. "When this has subsided, the apiflication of the hot iron may, if nccessar}, beTREATMENT OF ARTHRITIS. 225 rcpoatetl; in this way the deep gnawing pain will usually be^ readily removed, and suppuration of the joint may be averted. For counteiwrritants to be of any use, they must be employed before suppiu’ation has set in ; I believe that it is only torturing the patient unnecessarily to have recourse to these agents when once pus has formed in the articulation. In order that fuU benefit should be dcri^-ed from this plan of treatment, it must be persevered in steadily for a considerable length of time, and should be conjoined with a moderately antiphlogistic and alterative treatment. With this view, the perchloride of mercuryrin doses of fi-om one-sixteenth to one-twelfth of a grain, may be advantageously given with the compound decoction of sarsaparilla, or, if there be much debility, A\fith the compound tincture of bark ; good food and sthnu- lants being conjoined with it, in proportion to the advance of the debility. In proportion as the inflammatory action about the joint subsides, a tonic plan of treatment on ordinary medical principles should be substituted for that which had previously been employed. With respect to the local treatment of the inflamed joint in the inora advanced forms of the disease, it may be stated generally that, so long as it is tender on pressure, applied perpendicularly or laterally, so long as there is any loosening of the ligaments, or pain induced by movement, it must be kept absolutely at rest in sphuts, or what is better, by a starched bandage lyell wadded. During this period great care must be taken to keep the joint in a position most iisefid to the patient in after-life in the event of ankylosis taking place. But every means consistent with the safety of the joint should be taken to prevent its becoming stiff. With this view, as the inflammation lessens, and when pain has subsided, friction, douches, and passive motion shoifld be employed ; and if it be in the lower limb, slight extension by means of a weight attached to the foot may be kept up, so as to separate the articular surfaces from one another, and thus to lessen the chance of ankylosis by plastic bands. Should, unfortunately, these means fail, and suppmation take place in the joint, active steps must at once be taken to let out the pus freely and completely. If the skin covering it be reddened at any one part, the abscess should bo freely opened by one or two lateral incisions, extending fairly into the joint, so as to afford a free exit for the pus. In some cases, even when abscess has formed, the joint being perfectly loose and grating, by perseverance in proper treatment, both local and constitutional, a good and useful limb may be left; and, although there may be mobility and gxating, pronded there be no sign of abscess, the Siu’geon should never despair of obtaining a satisfactory result. The practice of making free incisions into a suppurating joint, as advocated by Gay, is a gi-oat improvement on the former method of merely punctiu’- ing it. If a small aperture only bo made, air is admixed with the pus, which becomes offensive and irritating, and, being unable to escape freely, sinks to the bottom of the articulation with debris of the disintegrated cartilages, &c., gi\ing rise not only to much local mischief, but to proportionate constitutional disturbance. By freely laying the joint open, all this is prevented; exit is given to the pus through one or two incisions that extend the whole length of the articulation; no constitutional disturbance can occur fi’om pent-up and putrid matter, and the joint has a better chance of healthily granulatino- VOL. II. 1226 DISEASES OF JOINTS. After tlic formation of abscess tbo prognosis is most nnfa\-oiirable, cspcciiilly when large joints such as the knee or hip are affected ; or when those are im- plicated Avhich arc important to life, snch as the articulations of the vcrtebraj; so, likcAvnsc, Avhen the articular ends of the long bones arc affected, it is seldom that the joint can recover itself, as caries or necrosis are compheating its disease and keeping it up. When the articulation is very sinuous, as in the carpus, or Avhen a number of small joints communicate with one another, if not directly by synovial membrane, at all events indirectly thi’ough the medium of ligament and of fibrous tissue, as in the tarsus, a cure can scarcely be anticipated. In aU these cases, hectic and great constitutional irritation usually come on. Pymmia is not unfrequently developed, or, the joint becoming useless or cum- bersome, its remoA'al must be practised either by excision or amputation. The result will at last in a great measure depend upon the state of the bones that enter into the confonnation of the joint. If these be sound, or not primarily affected, and the patient’s constitution has got over the effect of the occiuTence of suppuration in the joint, ankylosis more or less complete may be confidently looked for. Bnt if the articular ends of the bones be primarily or deeply impKcated, then excision or amputation will be the only alleviation. •, IWien an inflamed joint, whether it haA'e suppurated or not, appears to be disposed to undergo a cure, its repair must be facilitated by keeping it in a proper position, such as wiU be most useful to the patient in after-life, should it become stiff; the straight one for the knee and hip, and the semifiexed for the elboAV. IWien the ligaments have become softened so as to admit of lateral mobility, very special attention wiU be required to prevent displace- ment of the osseous surfaces from one another, either laterally or antero- posteriorly ; this may be produced partly by the weight of the hmb, partly by the traction of the muscles. Any neglect of proper precautions in the more- minute details of the application and adjustment of proper apparatus may be folloAved by a A’ery considerable amourut of deformity. Should the limb ah’cady unfortunately haA'e assumed a faulty position in consequence of the Surgeon neglecting to support it properly in splints in the early acute stage, the patient may be anaesthetised, and the limb sloAvly and gently placed in such a position as will be most conducive to his after-comfort. It may be useful to strap the joint firmly in the proper position, in the way recommended by Scott when it is the knee that is affected, or by means of starched bandages aa hen the hip or elbow are implicated. Scott’s plan of treatment consists in spread- ing on pieces of hnt the strong mercurial ointment, to every ounce of AV'hich a drachm of camphor has been added; strips of soap-plaster spread upon leather are then cut of a proper length and breadth, and the joint is fii-mly and accurately strapped up, the limb having previously been bandaged as- high as the joint that is strapped. This dressing may be left on for a week or two, until it loosens or gives rise to irritation ; oyer the Avhole a starched bandage may be apphed. In many cases I haA'e found it advantageous to strap up the joint Avith a plaster composed of equal parts ot the emplastrum am- moniaci cum hydrargyro, and the emplastrum saponis or belladonna. I hose applications not only fix the joint and promote the absoiption o tic matter that is deposited around it, but by acting as gentle counter-irritants.CHRONIC RHEUMATIC ARTHRITIS. 227 If remove tlie remains of the inflammation that may he going on within it. recovery ha^'e left the joint somewhat stiffened without being actually anky- losed, the natural movement must be restored by warm bathing, fomentation, friction, and passive motion. Warm water, in any way applied, is particu- larly and, indeed, singularly useful in a way difficult of explanation in restonng the mobility of stiffened joints. _ Ciiiioxic RuEinMATic Arthritis.—A disease has been described especially by R. Adams and R. W. Smith, of Dublin, to which the name Chronic Rheu- matic Arihritis has been given. It commonly affects the hip, but has been met with in the temporo-maxillary articulation and in the shoulder. I have met "with cases of disease of this joint presenting all the characters of this affection during life, though, as there has been no opportunity of examining the state of the parts after dkth, it is impossible to speak positively as to the true nature of the disease. Chronic rheumatic arthritis is an active disease of the bones and fibrous expansions about the joint: it is especially characterised by con- siderable increase in the size and by alteration in the shape of the osseous structures, which become porous in some parts, porcellanous in others; by thickening of the fibrous capsule of the joint, with deposition of masses or jilates of bone in it, and ultimate destruction of the cartilages and synovial membranes. The suffering is considerable; the disease greatly cripples the utihty of the joint, at last produces incomplete ankylosis, and is incurable. Dry Clironic Rheumatic Arthritis of the Hip.—This form of the disease commences with pain in and about the joint, increased at night, and especially in damp or cold ■weather, presenting in this respect the ordinary cha- racters of rheumatic affection ; as the disease advances, the pain, which is continuous, is much increased by standing or walking, and the movements of the joint become gradually more and more impaired. The patient experiences the greatest difficulty in bending the body forwards from the hips ; he consequently is unable to stooj), or to sit in the ordinary position, being obliged to keep the limb straightened in nearly a direct line with the trunk. The difficulty in walking, in standing erect, in stooping, and in sitting increases. The trochanter will be felt to be thickened, and in- creased breadth of bone is distinctly perceptible in this part of the thigh. The limb, at first perhaps slightly lengthened, eventually becomes shortened to the extent of about an inch or more, owing to changes that take place in the head of the bone. The pelvis also assiunes an oblique direction, and hence the apparent shortening becomes considerably greater. Ihe knee and foot may either be inverted or everted, and the heel is raised. The shape of the hip also alters considerably ; it becomes flattened posteriorly, the gluteal muscles waste so that the fold of the Rates diminishes and sinks to a lower level, but the trochanter projects Fig 438.—Diy Chronic: Rheu- matu! Artliritis of Right Hin- Jomt. 'DISEASES OF JOINTS. 228 more than natural, and on examination seems larger and thicker than natural (Fig. 438). On rotating the limlj, the movements of the bone are extremely limited, and crackling, grating, or osseous crepitation will often be felt around the joint. As Smith remarks, the lumbar vertebras acquire great mobility, the thigh on the alfceted side is wasted, but the calf retains its natural size and firnmess. Pathological Changes.—On examination after death, it will be found that the joint, the bones, and the sm-rounding parts, have undergone remarkable changes. The capsular ligament is thickened, and the syirovial membrane is of a bright red coloiu’, vascular, and fringed in some parts, whilst it has dis- appeared in others. The round ligament is destroyed, and the head of the bone denuded of membrane, the vascular fringes being attached around the neck. The head of the bone becomes remarkably altered in shape, being flattened, greatly increased in size, or placed more or less at a right angle Avith the shaft, sometimes elongated, and always very irregular and tuberous. The neck is more or less absorbed, and in some cases appears as if it had undergone fractm-e. The acetabulum generally becomes enlarged, sometimes of a more or less circular and flattened shape ; in other cases pro- jecting at its rim, narrowed, and embracing tightly the head of the thigh-bone (Fig. 439). Both it and the upper part of the thigh-bone become porous, and perforated with numeroirs small foramina.

When the bone becoines exposed, the mechanical irritation to which it is subjected causes the formation of a small quantity of new bone by ossification of the cancellous tissue. The new bone so formed is constantly being woni away by friction as long as motion is le in the joint. These changes are always fouud at the points most exposed to pressure. At the same time osteophytes grow from the bones in the neighbour- hood of the joint, and there is increased vascularity of the synovial mombrEme, with swelling of its fringes, and a slight excess of synovia at first, which is cloudv, fi-om°containing fragments of the grouiid-domi cartilage. The liga- ments may ossify. The osteophytes are more compact in their stnicture than those formed in diseases accompanied by an increase of vascularity, as round carious or necrosed pieces of bone. Loose nodules of bone are not infre- quently found in the subserous ceUiilar tissue. Causes.—This disease appears to be the result of malnutrition. It is not scrofulous, but occurs in persons whose health has been broken down by dyspeptic and other ailments that lead to impaired nutrition ; hence it most irequently occurs amongst the poorer classes. It is commonly met with in men. It usually occurs above the age of fifty; but I have seen several instances of it in individuals little more than thirty years of age, one of whom was a Avoman. Prognosis.—The disease is incurable, and, as it is commonly attended by much suffering, constitutes a source of gveat discomfort to the patient, though it is by no means dangerous to life, the disease not proceeding to suppuration, except in veiy exceptional cases. In fact, the tendency is to imperfect ankylosis; and the only instances in which I have seen suppuration take place have been ivhen it has occurred in persons at an earlier period of Hfe than usual, from thirty to forty years of age. Diagnosis.—It occasionally happens that an individual labouring under this affection, meeting with a fall or contusion on the hip, presents signs of fracture of the neck of the thigh-lone, such as shortening, eA'ersion, Avith some creifitation perhaps, and inability to move the limb. The diagnosis may in general readily be effected by attention to the history of the case, and by eheiting the fact that the symptoms have existed to some degree before the accident, although the pain and inunobility may have been increased by it. Treatment.—Little can be done to cure, but much to relieve and retard. Eest and the continued application of Avann or stimulating plasters AviU afford relief; and, in many instances, the administration of the iodide of potassium with sarsaparilla Avill lessen the nocturnal pain. Smith reconunends an elec- tuary composed of guaiactim, sulphur, the bitartrate and carbonate of potash, and ginger, Avith a small quantity of rhubarb ; and I have certainly seen benefit result from the administration of this remedy in some cases. Ammo- niaemn and cod-liver oil are both extremely useful in some cases. When the disease is once fairly established, and has assumed a very chronic character, it will be found of gi’cat importance to give the affected joint as much rest as possible, Avitliout confining the patient to the couch or house. This is best effected by his Avearing a proper supporting apparatus. This should consist of230 DISEASES OF JOINTS. a firm leather pelvic hand having a steel rod extending down the outside ol the limb, hinged angularly opposite the hip, knee, and ankle, and fixed into a socket in the sole of the boot, and properly adjusted by means of straps and moulded leather to the thigh and leg. By the use of this apparatus the weight of the limb is taken off, and all rotatory movement of the hip is prevented, to- and-fro motion being allowed. Dry Clironic Rheumatic Arthritis of the Lower Jaw.—Chronic rheu- matic arthritis has also been described by Smith as occasionally affecting the tem- poro-maxillary articulation in individuals of rather advanced life. This disease is mostly symmetrical, and gives rise to an enlargement of the condyle of the jaw, which can be felt under the zygoma, attended with much pain in opening the mouth, a sensation of cracking or gi’ating in the joint, and some enlargement of the lymphatic glands by the side of the neck. The pain is generally increased at night, and influenced by the state of the Aveather. The face becomes dis- torted, the affected side of the jaw projecting and being pushed towards the opposite side ; but Avhen both joints are affected the chin projects, the entire jaw being di-nAAni forwards. Tliis distortion is chiefly owing to the destruction of the articular eminence ; for, when this takes place, the external pterygoid muscle di’aws the jaAV forwards and to the opposite side ; but Avhen both articu- lations are equally affected, those muscles displace it directly forwards : the glenoid cavity becomes enlarged, the fibro-cartilage disappears, and the condyle is sometimes greatly thickened and flattened, and always rough, being devoid of cartilage. In such cases there is little to be done by :nedicines ; but the treatment must be conducted on the same principles as in the same affection attacking the hijD. Dry Chronic Rheumatic Airthritis of the Shoulder.—When it affects the shoulder, chronic rheumatic ai'thritis gives rise to a considerable enlarge- ment of the head of the humerus, wasting and rigidity of the deltoid, and inability to move the elboAV upwards, except by the rotation of the scapula on the trunk. In fact, the scapulo-himieral articulation being fixed, all move- ments of the shoulder are effected thi'ough the medium of the scapula, which becomes more mobile than natiu'al. The articulation is the seat ol much pain, lancinating at times, but generally gnawing and intermittent, being dependent on the state of the weather, and gveatly increased in cold and wet seasons. The whole of the arm becomes wasted, and Aveakened in power. In two instances I have seen this disease in young and otherwise robust and healthy men, betAveen twenty and thirty years of age, coming on without any apparent cause. In both cases the joint continued permanently rigid, though the pain Avas relieved by the use of the iodides and by local counter-irritation. Chronic Strumous Arthritis : White Savblling.—By White Swell- ing is meant a very chronic form of arthritis occurring in scrofulous subjects. _ . . , 1 , This condition has not in many cases any definitive stai-ting point, but appears sloAvly to supervene upon some slight injury, as a tAvist, or bloAA, or strain ; at other times it commences Avith a subacute synovitis, assimiing its peculiar characters by occurring in a strumous constitution, and is cspecia y liable to happen in children and females. j • • f • Symptoms.—disease presents peculiar character. The affected joint isPATHOLOGY OF WHITE SWELLING. 231 cnlai-o-cd and rounded, the bony prominences being elhiced by an uniform, douo-hy, semi-elastic, or pulpy swelling, occupying the interstices of the articu- lation. The integuments covering it preserve their white colour : there is usually but little pain felt, except in moving the limb ; and the position is always that in which the patient has most ease, the joint being generally semi- flexed. There is a degree of stiffness and rigidity in the joint ; and, in conse- quence of the wasting of the limb from disuse, the affected articulation appears more swollen than it really is. The general health does not appear at first to sufler much ; but, as the disease advances, symptoms of iiTitation and hectic declare themselves. This affection is always characterised by a special tendency to run on to suppuration, and in the majority of cases at last passes into this condition, although the tendency may be checked by pioper treatment. The joint suftei-s from exacerbations of interciuTent attacks of inflammation, the limb swells and becomes oedematous, and abscess Anally forms in and ai’ound the joint; often aromid, before it takes place within. When this is opened the constitutional symptoms become more severe, hectic speedily sets in, and strumous deposit in other organs, such as the lungs, at last carries off the patient. Pathological Changes.—In this affection the tissues immediately external to the joint, as the flbrous capsule and the investing areolar membrane, are always much thickened and infiltrated with fatty and plastic matter ; and the great tendency of this gelatinous infiltration to run into unhealthy suppm’ation greatly adds to the mischief that ensues. In the interior of the joint, we find much the same kind of changes that have been described as characterising acute arthritis ; the cartilages have lost their polish, their elasticity, and their firm hard section, being softened, eroded, and disintegrated ; the synovial membrane is removed in parts, and is here and there vascularised ; in others it is replaced, together with the cartilages, either by large quantities of the semi-transparent gelatinous-looking fatty deposit, or by the pulpy gxey or brownish fibro-ceUifiar material that is met with in arthritis. The ligaments are inflamed, softened, and destroyed, being converted into somewhat similar materials ; and the in- terior of the joint is fiUed with a pmulent-looking syno'sdal fluid, thin and yellow, usually containing a large quantity of fatty matter. The bones undergo important changes in this disease, the articidar ends becoming expanded and enlarged ; and, though this was denied by Crowther, Russell, and others, it is affirmed by more modern Surgeons, and I have had repeated opportunities of fietemiining the fact. In aU the cases that I have examined, the osseous tisue has luidcrgonc important changes, the compact structure having become thin and expanded, and the cells of the cancellated portion fiUed with a bloody and fatty serous fluid; or else the bone is softened, often cutting readily with the knife, and, owing to the deposit of fat, presents a yellower and more homo- geneous section than healthy bone. In some cases tuberculous matter is de- posited in it, and it is that that gives rise to the vomiem and circumscribed abscesses. Irom this it would appear, that the principal changes that take p ace in a joint affected with white swelling consist in an unhealthy striuuous in amraation of the parts, and in the consequent deposition of considerable quantities of semi-transparent and lowly organised exudation matter Avhich, in its tura, has a tendency to run into unhealthy suppuration, or to undergo fatty transformation. These fatty degenerations of the cancellous articular ends.DISEASES OF JOINTS. 232 and of the Avidely deposited and lowly organised exudative material, are tho common results of that impairment of nutrition that results from long con- tinued subinflammatory action. Billroth’s views on the intimate pathological changes that take place in Avhitc swelling are the most recent and exact that we possess on this subject. The following is a summary of them. The disease usually begins Avith chronic synovitis. The tufts are fomid in this stage to be swollen, soft, and succulent, and the Avhole membrane is. thickened. The synovia is increased in quantity and cloudy. These changes. gTadually increase. The synovial membrane becomes thick, SAvoUen, red, and the tufts form masses resembling spongy granulations. These synovial outgroAvths increase in size, and push in between the siufaces of the joint oA'er the cartilages. This groAvth gTadually spreads over the whole cartilage. At first it has no adhesion to the cartilage, but after a time it is found attached to it by vascular processes. Billroth compares it to ivy creeping over a Avail, and becoming attached at parts by its roots. This structure is evidently the same as Aston Key’s vascular synovial fi-inges (p. 221). It is around these vascular attachments that the changes in the cartilage are first noticed. The cartilage is gradually consumed, or rather converted into a tissue resembling that groAving over it from the synovial membrane. The microscopic chaiacters of this ncAv groAvth differ in no Avay from those of ordinary granulations. The changes in the cartilage commence by proliferation of the cells, till by rapid division each cell becomes converted into a group of round cells exactly resembling those of granulations. At the same time the hyaline matrix dis- appears, and at last the place of the cartilage is taken by granulation-tissue. Mter destruction of the cartilage, similar changes proceed in the exposed smfaces of the bones. At the same time that these changes have been going on, the capsule of the joint and the ligaments have become softened, swollen, and infiltrated Avith young cells, the whole cavity of the joint havhig at last- become filled with the new granulation-groAvth. Suppuration may occur at any spot, without necessarily extending to the whole joint. This not uufre- quently occiirs in the synovial pouches above the knee. Treatment.—In the treatment of Avhite swelling, we must beai’ in mind that we have to manage a truly scrofulous inflammation and its effects. Our first object should be to prevent, if possible, the occurrence of suppuration. In the early stage, Avhen the affection has come on insidiously, Avithout any veiy active symptoms, Ave must trust to general antistrumous treatment; to the influence of good diet and sea-air, and to the administration of tonics, cod- liver oil, and iodine. In the local treatment there are three gveat principles to be canled out. 1. Rest, with immoibilitij of the joint, is by far the most imjiortant element in the treatment, without Avhich all the efforts of the Surgeon to prcA ent suppuration and disorganisation of the joint will be futile. 2. Camj))cssion,\!ij means of bandages, strapping, or splints, AviU aid in the absoiqDtion of the plastic effusion in and around tho joint. 8. Countei'-rrritafion by means of issues, blisters, or the actual cauteiy, must be employed. These means, to be of real scmlce, should be used before suppuration has ocemred : aftei this, 1 believe they are of no use. The Hmb should be put into a position AAhich isANKYLOSIS. 233 not only most easy to tlie patient, but will leave it most useful should a stiff joint result. If it be one of the joints of the lower extremity that is afiected, especial care must be taken that the patient do not bear his weight on it. It the symptoms be of a rather acutely inflammatoiy kind, a few leeches may be applied • these, however, must be used as sparingly as possible, being conhned, cither to the earlier stages of the disease, or to the subdual of any more active iiiterciirrcnt inflammation. Kest is best secured by well-padded leather 01 gutta-percha splints in the earlier stages ; and, at a later period, by the appli- cation of the starched bandage, well lined with cotton-wadding, to the limb. This kind of appheation will be found to give the most efficient support, and will keep the whole of the limb perfectly motionless, so that the patient can take open-air exercise, and walk with the aid of crutches, without risk of injuring the diseased joint. In this respect the starched bandage presents gueat advantages over the short leather splints often used. It may readily be cut open opposite the diseased joint, so as to admit of the application of proper di’essings to it. The actual cautery is extremely beneficial in these cases, apphed as directed (p. 224); or caustic issues may be put in, at a little distance from the articulation, so that there may be no risk of the inflammatory action penetrating to it. After all inflammation has, in this way, been removed, and nothing but thickeniug and stifihess of the joint are left, measures may be adopted for re- moving these conditions, and restoring the flexibility of the articulation by frictions with somewhat stimulating and counter-irritant embrocations, and eventually its strength by douches of sea-water. The swelling and puffiuess. that are left, together with the debility dependent on relaxation of the liga- ments, are perhaps best remedied by the use of Scott’s strapping; but pressure should not be applied so long as there is evidence of active inflammation going' on in the articulation, which it would certainly increase. If abscess form, it must be freely opened by an incision of a proper length, the joint poulticed, and the patient’s general health attended to, so as to pro- mote the evolution of gTanulations, and prevent hectic. In these cases, if the limb can be preserved, its subsequent utility, and the patient’s comfort, will mainly depend upon the position in which it is allowed to become ankylosed. ANKYLOSIS OR STIFF JOINT. Anhjlosis is invariably the result of the impairment or more or less complete destruction of a joint by inflammation, and is one of the modes by which nature effects its repair. It consists in the more or less complete consolidation of the parts around and within the articulation. It is of two kinds : the Incomplete, or Filiro-cellular ; and the Complete, or Osseous. In the Incomplete or Pibro-cellular Ankylosis, the stiffiiess of the joint may be dependent on lour distinct pathological conditions, which may be more or less associated. 1, on thickening and induration of its fibrous capsule; 2, on the fonnation of fibroid bands as the result of inflammation within the joint; d, in consequence of the cartilages and synovial membrane being in part or wholly removed, and their place supplied by a fibroid or fibro-cellular tissue, l)y which the articular ends are tied together; 4, by shortening of the ligaments on the side of flexion of the joint. The stifihess of the joint may be materially234 DISEASES OF JOINTS. increased by tlie sliorteued and contracted state of the muscles around the joint. But this is secondary to, and not an essential part of, the ankylosis. The ill')roidjankylosis commonly results trom rheumatic or scrofulous arthritis, and is the most favourable result that can be hoped for in many of these affections, especially in the scrofulous inflammatory ones. In some cases it arises simply from disuse : the ligaments becoming shortened, and the limb becoming stiffened in the position in which it has been too long detained. Complete or Osseous Ankylosis is of two kinds. In one, all the soft parts within the joint are destroyed, and the osseous surfaces have coalesced, or are fused together by direct bony union ; this is most commonly seen in the hip, knee, and elbow (Fig. 440). In the other kind there has been flbro-cellular deposit, or degeneration within the joint; and the bones, imitcd partly by this, are also tied together by arches or bridges of osseous matter, thrown out externally to the articu- lation, and stretching across from one side to the other. It has been supposed that these masses proceed from the ossiflcation of the liga- ments, or even the muscles ; but from the inequality of their appearance, it is evident that they are new and accidental formations. The true or osseous ankylosis does not often occur as a consequence of scrofulous the result of pyaamic or traumatic constitution. It not nnfrequently Fig. 440.—Osseous Ankylosis of Hip. nrticular inflammation, but is usually inflammation in persons of a healthy happens, in old standing cases of diseased joint, that more or less complete nnkylosis is taking place at one part of the articulation, whilst caries, or necrosis of the bones, is going on at others. It is usually easy to make the Diagnosis between fibrous and osseous ankylosis; the joint being movable, though perhaps only to a very slight degree, in the false, whilst it is rigidly and immovably fixed in the true form of the disease. But cases not xmfi-e- quently occur in which the rigidity of the structures, muscular and capsular, outside the joint, is so great in the fibrous, and the mobihty of the iieighbom-- ino’ bones and joints so free in the osseous, that it becomes very difficult to decide to what degree the joint is stiffened. Here the diagnosis may be made by putting the patient under chloroform; when, if the ankylosis be ■fibrous, the joint will at once be found to yield. In fibrous aiJ:ylosis any attempt to move the joint forcibly is usnally accompanied and followed by much pain, whilst in osseous anlcylosis such attempts, unless very forcible, arc ^ It may be obseiwed as an additional means of diagnosis, that the fibrous ankylosis is often associated with some degree of dislocation of the bones o the affected joint; whereas in the osseous ankylosis the articular ends are usually fused together in their normal relations. „ . ^ i- Treatment.—The treatment of ankylosis is, in the first instance, of a pTREATMENT OF ANKYLOSIS. 235 cautionary nature ; that is to say, when the Siu-g-eon finds that the cstajjlish- mcnt of ankylosis is, as it wore, the natural means of cure adopted by natm-c in a deeply diseased joint, his efforts should be directed to taking care that the joint become fixed in such a position as will leave the most useful limb to the patient. Thus, if it be the hip or knee, the ankylosed joint should be ni the straight position ; if it be the elbow, it should be placed at a right angle, and the hand in the mid state between pronation and supination. 'When once ankylosis has occurred, the treatment to be adopted mil depend ])artly on the degree of stiffness, whether it be fibrous or osseous ; and partly on the object to be attained, whether this be merely the restoration of mobility in a part ankylosed in a good position, or the remedying of the deformity occasioned by faulty ankylosis. 1. In attempting to restore the mobility of a joint ankylosed in a good position, as of a straight but stiff knee, the Surgeon may usually succeed if the ankylosis be only fibrous, (when some degnee of movement will always be per- oe[)tible in the part,) by the employment of passive motion, frictions, and douches, more particularly with warm salt water or the mineral sulphimous springs. In the more obstinate cases, and where the immobility appears to dc])end, in some degree at least, on fibrous bands stretching across the joint, an attempt might be made to riiptme these subcutaneously. In doing this no mischief can result; for, the synovial structime of the joint ha'sfing been destroyed, no dangerous amoimt of inflammation can be set up in it. SajTc has estabhshed an important point in the distinguishing of those cases in which it is necessary to cut a contracted tendon or fascia, and those in Avhich it will yield by stretching without division. It is this; if, when the part is stretched to the utmost firm point and pressme is made on it with the finger, reflex action be induced, then it must be cut. If no reflex contraction ensue, then stretching is sufficient. '2. "When fibrous anlcylosis has taken place in a faulty position—if, for in- stance, the knee be bent, or the elboAV straight—the first thing to be done is to place the limb in such a position that it wiU be useful. This may most readily be done by putting the patient under the influence of chloroform, and then forcibly flexing or extending the limb as the case may require, Avhen with loud snaps and cracks it will usually come into proper position. Shoifid any ■of the tendons or bands of fascia near the joint appear to be particularly tense, they may be divided subcutaneously. Either some days before the extension is attempted, or else if it haA'C been earned as far as the rigid state of the ten- dons aam’11 permit, tenotomy may be practised, and, an inteiwal of a foAV days ha\ing been allowed to elapse, extension may be completed. The muscular contraction will however, in many cases, yield to gradual extension by means of screw splints or weights, and thus render tenotomy unnecessary. The in- flammatory action that folloAvs this forcible extension or flexion of the limb, is usually but very trivial; an evaporating lotion and rest will speedily subdue it. Indeed, it is siu-prising what an amount of violence may be inflicted on an ankylosed joint Avithout any bad consequences ensuing. After the limb has been restored to its proper position, passive motion and frictions may tend to increase its mobility. 3. 'When osseous ankylosis has taken place, and the position of the limb is a236 DISEASES OF JOINTS. j^ood one, it ■will generally be ■wiser for the Surgeon not to interfere ; except in the case of the elbow-joint, which, in these circumstances, may be excised with advantage, so as to substitute a mo^N'able for an immovable articulation. If the position bo faulty, the osseous union may be sawn, drilled, and broken through subcutaneously ; or a wedge-shaped piece of the bones may be taken out, and the position of the limb thus rectified. 4. Amputation may be required in cases of faulty anlcylosis with so much atrophy of the limb as to render it useless, or in cases in which there is necrosed or carious bone co-existing with ankylosis and rigid atrophy of the muscles of the limb. LOOSE CARTILAGES IN JOINTS. It sometimes happens that the synovial membrane of a joint assumes a Warty Condition, as the result of chronic irritation of the articulation. This warty state of the membrane usually consists of flattened fibroid de- posits upon its surface. In other cases these may become pedimculated, and pendent into its interior. For this condition, which gives rise to occasional uneasiness and pufiiness about the joint, with a crackling or creaking sensation when it is moved, but little can be done beyond the application of discutient plasters and the use of elastic bandages. Loose Cartilages, as they are termed, arc not unfrequently met -with in the different articulations. In many cases they are not truly cartilaginous, but appear to be composed of masses of condensed and indurated fibroid tissue, not very dissimilar in structure from the warty syno\ial membrane just referred to, and from which they appear to be detached. In fact, the flattened and tuber- culated fibroid deposits forming warty growths, the pedimculated fibroid masses, and the same detached or lying loose in the interior of the joint, appear to be successive stages or conditions of the same pathological formation. Though commonly fibroid, it is probable that in some cases these bodies may be truly cartilaginous. There can be no doubt that occasionally they are portions of articular cartilage which have been chipped off by some injury. Characters.—These bodies vary in size fr’om a barley-corn to a chestnut. When small, they are round ; when large, they are somewhat flattened or de- pressed on the surface. They are smooth, shining, and usually of a yello’wish or greyish-white colour. They are most frequently met with in the knee ; but not uncommonly occur in the elbow or the joint of the lower jaw, and occa- sionally in the shoulder. Most commonly only one is found ; but their number may range from this up to fifty or sixty. Symptoms.—The severity of the symptoms will to a great extent depend upon the mobility of the loose cartilage, and its consequent gTcatcr or less liability to be nipped between the opposite articular surfaces in the movements of the joint. When these bodies are tolerably firmly attached to the synovial membrane, they may merely occasion weakness of the joint, with occasional synovial effusion. When loose they usually give rise to a very distinct train of symptoms. The most marked of these is the very severe pain which occiu’s in particular movements of the limb. This comes on suddenly, jirevents the patient from either straightening or flexing the joint completely, and is often so intense as to cause faintness or sickness. It is usually followed by a degree237 TREATMENT OF LOOSE CARTILAGES. of sniovial inflammation, and by relaxation of the ligaments. These attacks of pain and of sudden imtability of flao_part come on at the result of movements of it: they commonly happen in the knee whilst the n^tait is walking. It is difflcult to say to avhat this severe pa, u is due Sachet thinks it W be owing to the synovial bemg pmehed between the foreign body and one of the articular surfaces. I think that it s most probably due to the foreign body being drawn in between the opposite surfaces of the joint, when these are separated anteriorly 111 the act of flexion of the knee, and then, when the limb is extended, acting as a wedge between these, tending to keep them separate and mteifering with the complete straif^htenino- of the limb. In consequence of this w^edge-like action of the loose” cartilage the ligaments are violently stretched, and the sickening pain consequent on this act is experienced, followed, as happens in a violent sprain, by rapid synovial effiision. The sensibility of the ligaments of a joint is of that peculiar nature that it is only called into action when an attempt is made to stretch them, and thus forcibly to counteract or destroy their natm-al use. Ligaments may be cut without any suffering, but they cannot be stretched, cither by accident or disease, without the most severe pain. In some cases the loose cartilage can be felt by carrying the finger over the joint, when it may be detected under the capsule, slipping back when pressure is exercised upon it, and often possessing great mobility, gliding from one side of the joint to the ■other, so as to be extremely difficult to be fixed. Treatmext.—The palliative treatment consists in supporting the joint with ••an elastic bandage or knee-cap, so as to limit its movements, and thus prevent the liability to the recun-ence of the attacks of pain ; and in this way the fixing and ultimate absorption of the cartilage may sometimes be obtained. 'This I have several times seen to occur in patients who either refused to be •operated on, or in whom an operation was not thought advisable. Any infiam- mation that has been excited requires to be subdued by proper antiphlogistic treatment. If the cartilage occasion great and frequent suffering, so as to interfere •.seriously with the utility of the limb, and if it appear to be of large size, and io be loose and single, means may be taken for its extraction. But it must be borne in mind that, whilst the loose cartilage is at most an inconvenience, though perhaps a serious one, any operation for its removal by which the joint is opened, becomes a source of actual danger to limb and even to life. It is far less dangerous, in fact, to leave the foreign body than to perform the ■operation necessary for its extraction. Hence an operation should not be lightly proposed or undertaken, without warning the patient of the possible consequences that might follow. No operation should be undertaken so long as the joint is in an instated state, as the result of a recent attack of pain and inflammation ; this must be first subdued, and then the operation may be pro- ceeded with ; nor should it be done if the patient’s health be broken. The extraction used to be effected by directing the patient in the first instance to make those movements by which he usually gets the cartilage fixed in the joint. So soon as the Surgeon feels it (as this operation is commonly required in the knee), he should push it to one side of the patella, where he must fix it firmly with his forefinger and thumb; ho then draws the skin covering it to one sideDISEASES OF JOINTS. 23S so as to make it tense, and cuts directly down upon the cartilage by a suf- ticiently iree incision to allow its escape. The Avoiind, which, when the skii» IS relaxed, will be somewhat valvular, is then closed by a strip of plaster and the limb is kept at I’est for a few days until it has united. Severe inflamma- tion of the joint less frequently follows this coarse operation than might have been expected, the synovial membrane haA'ing probably undergone some modification of action that renders it little liable to this process. It has, how- CAei, happened, that acute synoAutis has set in, and this has teiminated in suppuration of the joint, causing the patient’s death, requiring amputation, or leading to ankylosis. It has been proposed by Chassaigne, in order to obviate the dangers of direct and open Avound into the joint, to remove the loose cartilage by subcutaneous section ; this he accomplishes in a way that I have seen practised by Liston, and have often done myself, auz., by passing a tenotome obliquely under the skin, after fixing the foreign body in the way that has aheady been described, dividing the synoAial membrane freely, and then squeezing the cartilage into the areolar tissue outside the joint, where it is finally fixed by plaster and bandage, and then may be left to be eventually taken up by the absorbents of the part. Goyrand recommends the same subcutaneous mode of removal of the foreign body fr’om the inside of the joint; but, instead of leaving it to be absorbed, extracts it at the end of eight days, by a fresh incision, from the areolar tissue in which it has been lying. A most useful modification of this method has been practised by Square, of Plymouth ; it consists in fixing the loose cartilage, cliAiding the capside sub- cutaneously over it, and then pressing the foreign body into the opening thus made, retaining it there by a compress and plasters. In operating by this method on the knee, the cartilage should be fixed below and to the inner side of the patella, between it and the head of the tibia ; a long naiTOAV tenotome is then introduced obliquely under the skin from a distance of about tAvo inches below the loose cartilage ; the capsule of the joint is freely divided, the sub- cutaneous areolar tissue freed by a slight SAveep of the blade, and the loose cartilage then pressed into the cavity thus made to receive it, and slid along the areolar tissue for about three inches. It is fixed in situ with a firm pad and adhesive plaster ; the foot and leg are bandaged up to the edge of the cartilage, and the limb is placed on a splint. If no inflammatory symptoms ensue, the cartilage is excised about a Aveek after the operation ; or it may be left to be absorbed. By the adoption of these subcutaneous methods, there will be but A'ery little danger of inducing undue inflammation in the joint, the entrance of air being prevented, Avhich, and not the mere section of the capsule and synovial membrane, constitutes the chief risk. Should there be more than one loose cartilage, the operation must be repeated, but not until any inflammation induced by the former one has been subdued. In this way I haA^e successfully removed in succession five loose cartilages from one knee. NEUBALOIA OP JOINTS. Pain of a scA’erc character is often experienced in or aimmd a joint, closclj' simulating, but not dependent upon, inflammation or other structural disease.239 KEUliALOIA OF JOINTS. This pain, which is purely neuralgic, may either have its origin m some local irritation of a nerve leading to the sensitive part, or it may be dependent on constitutional disorder of an hysterical character. It is this class of cases, pccuiTin- in young women who are either the subjects of hysteria, or are of a hio-hlv ner^•ous temperament, that should especially be considered as Neuralgia of” the Joints, to which the attention of the profession has principally been directed by the labours of Sir B. Brodie. . SviiPTOiis.—It is generally found that the hip, knee, ankle, or shouldei is the joint affected—the hip and the knee more especially. The neuralgia is usually localised in a particular joint by some slight injury that the part has sustained. But it is important to observe that in these cases the pain often does not develop itself for some days, or e^'en weeks, after the injury that is the alleged cause of it. Severe pain in the joint is complained of; and the limb is rendered eompai-atively useless, often with a good deal of distortion or contrac- tion. On examination, it wiU be found that the pain, which is commonly very severe, is supei’ficial and entaneous, not existing in the interior of the articula- tion, nor increased by pi'essnre of the articnlar siu’faces against one another ; and that it is not strictly confined to the joint, but radiates for some distance- around it. This pain is often intermittent in its character, and is frequently associated with nem-algia elsewhere, as in the spine ; and not unfreqnently with uterine inltation or disease. At the same time, it will be observed that all the signs that ought to accompany a severe attack of inflammation in a joint, such as would be attended by a con-esponding amount of pain, are absent; there being no painful startings of the limb at night, no heat, redness, or swelling of it, nor constitutional fever and irritation ; and the suffering being increased by causes, such as mental and emotional disturbance, that do not influence organic disease. Attention to these various circimistances will usually enable the Surgeon to diagnose the nature of the attack without much difficulty ; the- only cases in which he will really experience any, being those in which the tissues around the joint have been thickened, indmated, and altered in their characters by the application of issues, moxte, &c.; or by some slight articular disease having at some time existed, but hamng been cured. Causes.—The neuralgia is often referable to the irritation of some particular ncr\'e, either at its origin or in its course. This is particularly the case with neuralgia of the hip and knee, which will often be found to be dependent on irritation of the obtmator nerve, owing to intrapelvic inflauunation, congestion, or adhesion. In one case of secondary abdominal cancer under my care, the patient was seized with the most intense pain in the right hip and knee, so as to lead to the suspicion that these joints were diseased. On examination after death, it was found that the pain resulted from the implication of the obturator ner\-e in a mass of intrapelvic cancer, the joints themselves being perfectly sound. fuEATiiEXT.—The treatment must be constitutional, directed especially to re-establish a healthy condition of the uterine organs. If there be amcnorrhoca and amemia, aloetics and the preparations of iron must be given; if uterine irritation or ulceration exist, this must be removed by proper local moans, and the general health attended to. General nervine antispasmodics and tonics, such as valerian and bark, or assalectida and quinine in full doses, should be240 DISEASES OF JOINTS. freely administered. The most efficient treatment that can be directed to the affected joint is the application of cold douches and the employment of the continuous electric current, which -null cure cases in which all other means have failed ; the application of atropine and aconite may be of service to allay the pain when especially severe. If contraction or other distortion of the limb exist, the patient should be put under chloroform, and extension or rectifica- tion of faulty position then made, care being taken to keep the limb on splints in a proper position for some time after the operation.241 EXCISION OF JOINTS. CHAPTER XLIX. EXCISION OF JOINTS. History.—The operation of resection of the articular ends of hones dates from the very earliest periods of Surgery of which we have any record. Hip- pocrates (in his Chapter on Injuries of Joints) speaks of resections of bones at the joints, whether of the foot, the hand, the leg, the ankle, the fore-arm, the wrist, as being for the most part nnattended by danger, except from syncope or consecutive fever. Celsns, in speaking of compound dislocations, says, if the bare bone project it will always be an obstacle to reduction ; that which protiTides should therefore be cut off. Panins iEgineta says that, if a bone project, as after a transverse fracture, we must cut it off. Thus, it will clearly be seen that it was the practice of the ancients in compound dislocations, and in compound fractures, to resect the protruding bones. But that the practice of resection in cases of disease was not unknown to them, is also evident from a passage on fistulte in the works of Panins ^gineta, who directs that, if the fistula terminate -with a bone, and if that be not diseased, it should only be scraped; but if it be carious, the whole diseased portion should be cut out with chisels; and, if necessary, it may have a hole bored in it with a trephine; and a little further on he says, “ the extremity of a bone near a joint, if diseased, is to be sawn off; and often, if the whole of a bone, such as the ulna, radius, tibia, or the like, be diseased, it is to be taken out entire.” Nothing can probably be more explicit than this statement, in which the practice is aJlnded to as of frequent occurrence. But he makes exceptions in the case of the bones of the spine and pelvis, and the head of the femur, which, he ^ys, should not be operated on for fear of the neighbouring arteries. The practice of resection thus known, to and adopted by the ancients, and mentioned by the Arabian writers of the middle ages, fell completely into disuse, and seems entirely to have been forgotten until the middle of the last eentury, when occasional notices of its adoption appear in Surgical essays. It was first employed in eases of compound fr-actures and dislocations of joints. In militaiy practice, the Surgeon, in two or three instances, picked out and cut away fragments of the bones forming the wist, elbow, shoulder, and ankle joints when shattered by gun-shot. This early revival of resection im'olved no principle of treatment: imperfect operations being simply had recourse to on the field of battle as a matter of convenience in particular cases. The Sur- geons who performed them did not recognise any new rule of practice as beino- involved in these chance procedures. The first resection practised for injury in which the articular ends in com- pound^dislocations were fairly, deliberately, and successfully removed, appears IIEXCISION OF JOINTS. 242 to have occurred to Cooper of Bungay, before or at latest about the luiddle of the last century. The precise date of this case is unknown ; but Gooch -wTitino- in 17o8, says that it occun-ed “many years agothat the ends of both tibia and fibula Avere sawn off in a compound luxation of the ankle ; that the limb was preserved, and was so useful that the patient was able to walk and gain his livelihood. In or about the year 1758, Wainman of Shripton sawed off the lower end of the humerus in a case of compound dislocation of the elbow-joint with perfect success, the patient recovering Avith an arm as movable “as if nothing had ever been amissand his example was shortly afterwards folloAved by Tyne of Gloucester, who in a similar case removed two and a half inches of the lower end of the himierus. From this period, the operation of excisions of the articular ends of bones in cases of compound dislocations and fractures into joints became an established practice, and was extensively adopted by Percy in France, Avho, in 1794, exhibited to Sabatier nine soldiers in whom he had successfully excised the head of the humerus for gun-shot injury; by Bilguer in Germany, and by Hey of Leeds, and by numerous other Surgeons in this country and abroad. The first case in which a methodical attempt at resection for disease of the articular end of a bone was made occurred to White of Manchester in 17G8, Avho thus removed a large portion of the upper part of the humerus, though it is doubtful whether he actually excised the head of the bone. However this may be, he had prevdously satisfied himself by experiments on the dead body that this operation AA-as practicable. Although the head of the humerus may not have been removed by White in this case, it certainly was three years later by J. Bent of Newcastle, who in 1771 excised by a formal and pre- arranged operation the carious head of the humerus Avith complete success. His examjAle was followed in 1778 by Orred of Chester, aaLo also operated successfully in a similar case. About the same time, 1775, Justamond, Siu- geon to the Westminster Hospital, removed, in a case of disease of the elbow- joint, the olecranon and two inches of the ulna. In 1762, Filkin of Northwich removed the articular ends of the femur and tibia, together with the patella, in a man affected with disease of the knee- joint, resulting from a fall from a horse. Filkin AA’as led to this operation as a substitute for amputation of the limb, to which the patient refused to submit, in consequence of having experimentally practised it on the dead subject. The patient recovered rapidly, had an useful limb on which he Avas able to Avalk long distances, and was certainly ahve nearly thirty years after the opera- tion. This remarkable case seems to have attracted little, if any, attention, and indeed Avas not published until 1790, after Park of Liverpool brought before the Profession his second successful case of excision of the knee-joint, Avhich occuiTcd in 1789. That Surgeon had performed his first operation of this kind most successfully, as regarded utility of limb, iu 1781, apparently Avithout any previous knowledge of the operation that had been done by I ilkin nearly tAventy years previously. The example thus set by the English Surgeons was speedily followed by the Moreaus in France, who, between the years 1786 and 1789, sent A-arious memoirs to the French Academy on this subject. The operation, hoAvever,INDICATIONS FOR EXCISION 243 was Tiolontly opposed by the great body of Surgeons, and, with the exception of the occasional removal of the head of the humerus, fell into almost com- plete neglect both in this country and abroad for a period of nearly forty years, during which time the records of Surgery do not contain as many cases in Avhich the articular ends of bones were excised for disease. The operation of excision of diseased joints, though occasionally practised, continued in this languid state until 1831, when it received anew and vigorous impulse, so far as its application to diseases of the elbow was concerned, by the publication of Syme’s essay on that subject, and by the practice of Liston some years subsequently at University College Hospital. In 1845 these operations were again prominently brought before the Pro- fession ))y the performance of excision of the head of the femur by Fergusson ; and although exeision of the knee-joint had occasionally been practised by Synae, Crampton, Textor, Demme, Heyfelder, and others, it was not until its revival in 1850 by the same accomphshed Surgeon, that it came to be exten- sively practised. Since that period, the operation of excision has been applied to almost every joint withhi reach of the Surgeon’s knife. Before proceeding to discuss the different resections in detail, we must endea- vour to lay down some general rides for their performance in those cases in which they are alone admissible. IxDiCATioxs FOK Excisioif.—The excision of an articulation may be prac- tised for the foUoiving reasons :— 1. As a substitute for amputation in cases in which the joint is so extensively diseased, that the patient will be worn out by the discharge or pain, unless it be removed. Here an useful limb may be secured by the sacrifice of the diseased part. 2. In some cases of articular disease in which amjndation woxdd not loe justi- fiahle, excision may be done in order to hasten the cure, and thus to save years of suffering to the patient. Z. Excision may be done in cases in which amimtation is not ’practicable ; as in disease of the hip-joint or of the temporo-maxillary articulation. 4. As a substitute for other and less efficient treatment, in order to restore the 'Utility of a limb or joint; as in osseous ankylosis of the elbow, or in faulty osseous ankylosis of the knee. ^ 5. Excision may be required in bad compound dislocations and fractures into pints especially in yun-shot injuries ; more particularly in those of the head of the humerus, and of the elbow. As a general rule, resections are more required for diseases of the articidar ends of bones than for simple disorganisation of joints. If only the soft s nictures of a joint be involved, it usually happens that, without the necessity ot resection or operation of any kind, an useM limb will result; in the upper mobility of the articulation; in the lower with more or Qf-f ^ ° fm.i.ylosis, sufficient for a fair basis of support. But when the n 1 u ion IS very strumous, or the bones are primarily or extensively affected bc^comeuTehd!^^^^^^*^ recover to such an extent as to CoxDiTioxs OF Success.—For resection to succeed, the following condi- tions appear to me to be necessary. mnoving condi-EXCISION OF JOINTS. 244 1. The disease should not he too extensive, so that its removal would entail such an amount of mutilation of the limb, as to render it less useful to the patient than an artificial member would be. This is especially important in the lower extremity. If the bones be so extensively affected as to recpiire to be shortened by a considerable extent—for several inches—a limb would be left, which, instead of serving as a proper basis of support to the patient, would only be an useless incumbrance. In the upper extremity, length and strength are of less consequence than in the lower; the preservation of the hand is the chief thing to aim at, and, if this be effected, the bones may be encroached on to a greater extent than is proper in the lower limb. 2. The disease for which resection is practised should be allowed to become chronic before any operation is undertaken : for this there are two reasons. First, in the acute stage of disorganisation of a joint, it is not always possible to say, however unpromising the case may appear, whether ankylosis may not result, so that as useful a limb Avould be left as could be obtained by resection. And, secondly, if the joint be excised whilst acute and active disease is going on, inflammation and diffuse suppuration of the medullary canal are liable to set in—a condition very apt to be followed by phlebitis and pyeemia. In the only fatal instances of resection of the elbow-joint that I have witnessed, death resulted from this cause; the operation having been performed Avhilst the articular affection was acute. 3. The soft parts about the joint must be in ct sufficwntlij healtluj state. There are two morbid conditions connected with the soft parts that may interfere Avith the success of resection. First, they may be so thinned and permeated by sinuses, and so adherent to the bones, that an insufficient covering Avould be left. Or, secondly, the long-continued existence of strumous disease in joints and bones may give rise to a great deposit of loAvly organised plastic matter aroimd the articulation. This material becomes insusceptible of healthy organisation, and sloAvly suppurates. Sinuses form in it; the integuments covering it become blue and doughy ; and the soft parts around the seat of operation fall into a state of strumous disorganisation, that prevents alike the formation of a false joint, osseous ankylosis, or the healing of the wound, and thus leads inevitably to the ultimate amputation of the limb. Even though this exudation-matter do not exist in large quantity, if the joint be peculiaily loose, OAving to softening and disorganisation of ligamentous and tendinous structimes, excision is not A'ery likely to succeed, especially in the ankle oi 4. The state of the patknt's constitution must necessarily influence the Surgeon materially in his determination whether to resect or to amputate. ^ If the constitution be tolerably sound, or even if the general health have given Avay as the simple consequence of pain, irritation, and continued discharge, resection Avill have a fair prospect of success. In fact, Avhen the patient is hectic in consequence of continued suppurative action, the removal of tlic joint or bone that maintains such action may be advantageously practised. But it there be a state of in-itative fever in consequence of continuance and spreading of morbid action, the operation is likely to occasion erysipelas, phlebitis, or pyiemia, and is not a safe measure. So, also, if the constitution appear to be very much broken down, the patient being amcmic, wasted and cachectic.245 REPAIR AFTER EXCISIOFT. with some iiTitativc fever, but with no open abscess in connection with the ioint to account for the cachectic condition, excision of the larger joints, as of the knee and hip, is not desirable. If the patient be very highly strumous, or decidedly phthisical, there will be little prospect of his being able to bear up through the long convalescence that follows resection. A slight degree of pulmonaiy disease, however, which appears to be rather the result of the long- continued in-itation of the local affection, than of any constitutional taint, need not be a bar to operation. In such cases I have several times had occasion to observe that the general health improved rapidly after the removal of the local clisenso* 5. The extremes of life are unfavonraUe to resections. In very early child- hood, these operations are seldom necessary ; the natural processes usuaUy sufficing, with A’ery httle assistance, to eliminate diseased bone, and the dis- organised joints admitting readily enough of ankylosis. If the disease be too severe for this, it wull usually be found to be associated Avith so strumous a constitution as to interfere with healthy reparative action of any kind. Another serious objection to these operations in young children is that, should the epiphyses be removed, the development of the limb will be arrested to a great extent, if not entirely. At advanced periods of life, destructive joint-disease is not very common, and when it does happen, it is generally in constitutions not fitted to stand up against the prolonged drain consequent on these opera- tions. It is at the early adult age when the diseases most frequently occur that render resections necessary, that these operations are best borne. Eepair after Excision.—The mode of repair after resection differs according to the circumstances of the operation. When, as A'ery commonly happens in cases of necrosis, the periosteum, thickened, infiltrated, and loosened, can readily be detached, or, indeed, is already separated, without injury to itself, from the dead bone, reproduction of new osseous tissue to a very considerable extent may be expected. My own obseiTations on the fibula, tibia, and ulna, and those of Ollier and Maisonneuve, prove the importance of the periosteum as an organ of repair after the extrac- tion of a dead shaft or bone from within it. Eepair in this way is, I belicA’e, chiefly to be looked for in the shafts of the long bones ; although some Surgeons, as Annandale of Edinburgh, haA^e described the os calcis as having been reproduced after subpei’iosteal excision. The remarkable osteogenetic properties possessed by the periosteum haA'e been fully and conclusively esta- blished by the expei’iments and observations of Ollier. He has shown that a bone is much more rapidly and perfectly reproduced after remoA'^al, if the periosteum be left, than if it be removed, and he states that the osteogenetic * properties of this membrane are greater in the long than in the short bones. e is also of opinion that resections performed by the subperiosteal method ea\e bettor results, so far as the shape and formation of the new joint are concerned, than if this membrane be sacrificed. These observations, indeed, conclusively establish the importance of making in all cases every effort to prcseive the periosteum during a resection. \\ hen a short bone, as the os calcis, has been entirely removed, with its periosteum attached, it is never, of course regenerated, but its place is occupied by a thick, firm, fibrous cicatrix.246 EXCISION OF JOINTS. "W hen partial excision of a bone is practised, the result varies according to the tissue that is removed. If a portion of the compact tissue have been cut away, callus is thrown out. If it be the cancellous structure that is scooped out, the ca^dty left is filled up by a dense fibrous mass which may eventually ossify. A^Ticn a joint has been excised, either osseous or ligamentous ankylosis may take place ; and the Surgeon should endeavour to secure osseous union in some cases, fibrous in others. Thus, when the knee has been excised, as a sound and firm limb is desirable, osseous ankylosis should, if possible, be brought about ; whilst in the upper extremity, where mobility is of more use than strength, ligamentous union is most desnable. In these cases the ends of the bones become roimded, and are united by a dense mass of fibrous tissues which envelopes them, and to which the insertions of those muscles that arc natm-ally connected Avith the articular ends that have been removed become attached. The question as to the arrest of the development of the bone, and conse- quently of the whole limb on which an operation of excision has been per- formed, is one of great practical moment. It is well known to physiologists that the longitudinal growth of a bone is chiefly carried on through the medium of the layer of cartilage by which the epiphysis is attached to the shaft, and which does not become ossified until the bone has attained its full length. It has finther been pointed out by Humphry, that the two epiphyses of the long bones of the hmbs do not take an equal share in this development, but that one is a more active organ of growth than the other. Thus the upper epiphysis in the humerus and tibia, the lower epiphysis in the radius and femur, are the most important in this respect. If, therefore, in an excisive operation practised on a grooving child, in whom osseous development has not fully taken place, the whole of the epiphysis be removed, the subsequent gTOAvth of the bone, and necessarily of the whole hmb, Avill be arrested propor- tionately to the share that the epiphysis which is so removed takes in the development of the bone. And if that epiphysis on which the length of the bone is chiefly dependent, be removed—as, for instance, the upper epiphysis of the tibia and humerus, or the lower epiphysis of the thigh-bone—the limb will continue undeveloped and useless for. the rest ol life. In the adult, after ossification is completed, the epiphysis loses its import- ance as an organ of growth; and may be removed, if necessary, Avithout interfering with the subsequent length of the limb, except to the extent of its removal. Instrumeijts.—The instruments required for resection are of a someAVhat varied character; strong scalpels and bistouries, straight and sharp-pointed. In addition to these I have found a strong-backed, probe-pointed bistoury A\uth a limited cutting edge, of great utility in clearing the bones. The pliers should be of various sizes and shapes (Figs. 411 to 414), and gouges will be found useful for scooping out suspicious patches on the cut osseous surfaces. For ordinary purposes, a small broad amputating saw will be found the most coiiA'cnient instrument for dmding the bones ; but in some cases a naiiow keyhole saAv, or that introduced by Butcher (lig. 441), Aiill ansA\ci es . last-named instrument is especially useful AA’hcu it is intended to cut ic one247 OFEB AT ION OF EXCISION obliquely, or u’hon the space is limited ; for, as the blade is nanw and its ano-li can be changed at pleasure, any required direction can be communicated to "the cut I almost im-ariably use it in preference to all others in resections But some Surgeons prefer, especially in resection of the knee-jomt a short and very broad-bladed saw; the blade being of more than sufficient breadth to take in the whole thickness of bone to be divided. The chain-saw is perhaps not used so frequently as it might be. Operation.—The steps of the operation must of course vary with the different resections ; but there are some general rules that may be laid down as ajiplicable to all cases. 1. The incisions through the soft parts should be sufficiently fr’ee to expose thoroughly the bones to be removed. By making them, as far as practicable, parallel to tendons, blood-vessels, and nerves, parts of importance may readily be avoided. 2. As little of the bone as possible should be removed. The gouge may be applied to any carious or tuberculous cavities or patches that appear upon the surface of the fr’eshly-cut bone ; and, in this way, shortening of the bone by the saw may be materially avoided. 3. In young children the epiphysis should never be entirely removed, as it is on the growth of this portion of bone, or rather on that of the epiphysial cartilaginous layer adjoining the shaft, that the development of the bone in length is mainly dependent. 4. In adults in whom the bone has attained its maximum longitudinal development, the epiphysis may be more freely removed, if necessary. But the shaft should not bo encroached upon if it can be possibly avoided, and especial carc should be taken not to open the medullary canal. 0. The periosteum should be carefully preserved, being stripped off the bone uhere it is thickened and loosened, and manipulated very gently, so that its vitality may not be in any way impaired. 0. It is ot great importance not to confound bone softened by inflammation, but otherwise healthy, or roughened deposits of now osseous matter, with that which is carious or necrosed. 7. Skin, however redundant, should seldom if ever be cut away. The flaps, at fiist too largo, soon shrink do urn to a proper size, and, if trimmed, are very apt to become too scanty. 8. After the operation, light dressings only should bo used. As healingEXCISION OF JOINTS. 24S always takes place by granulation, no accurate closing of the wound is neces- sary , but it is sufficient to lay the limb on a pillow, or well padded splint, and to apply water-dressing. "VATien it begins to granulate, more accurate attention to position is required. i). The constitutional after-treatment should be nourishing or stimulating. As there will be a great drain on the system, and a prolonged confinement to bed, the strength must be kept up under it by good diet. These operations are always serious; iu many cases fully as much so as the amputation of a corresponding part, or even more so, owing to the large wound that is often inflicted in the more extensive division of the bones ; to the necessity of making the incisions in the midst of diseased or injured structures ; and to the more prolonged character of the after-treatment. Hence it is of especial importance that the general health should be carefully maintained after these operations. 10. Should caries or necrosis return after the operation, secondarij resection may be required. This I have done successfully at the hip, shoulder, and elbow-joints. In the elbow, in one case I performed a third resection with perfect success; the two previous operations, which had been performed by other and different Surgeons, having failed. The success of these secondary resections will necessarily be greatly dependent on the possibility of establish- ing an improved state of the patient’s constitution. EXCISIONS OP THE UPPEB EXTREMITY. The whole of the upper extremity is subservient to the hand. It is to render this more widely useful as an organ of prehension and of touch that the shoulder, the elbow, and the wrist-joints are endowed with varied and extensive movements. But the movements of each one of these joints so supplement those of the others, that any one articulation may be removed, and yet the limb be left vith a sufficient range and variety of movements to render the hand useful for all the ordinary purposes of hfe. The limb may be shortened, and it may be weakened; and yet, if sufficient length and strerrgth be left to enable the individual to use his hand, an immense gain will result. The limb withorrt the hand would be an useless appendage. The hand left in its integrity is usefrrl in a great variety of ways, however mutilated the other parts of the rqrper extremity may be. Hence, provided the Surgeon carr save the hand, he rreed not hesitate to sacrifice other portions of the hmb ; and the shoulder, elbow, or wrist, may each and severally be removed, and the patient left in the possession of a most useful and efficient member ; shortened, it is true, and to a certain extent curtailed in its movements, but possessing all the delicate and intricate motions of the hand in full perfection and ft’eedom. Shoulder-JOINT.—Excision of the shoulder-joint may be required for two conditions : 1. Disease, and 2. Compound and Comminuted Fracture of the articulation. 1. Hxcisiou for Sisease.—For disease, excision is not so conunonly required in this as in many other articulations ; primary disease of the soft articular structm’es of this joint not being very frequent, and, when it happens, usually terminating in false ankylosis, without siqipiuntion. When carious and necrosed bones are met with about the shoulder, it will frequently beEXCISIOy OF HEAD OF HUMERUS. 249 ibuiid that the coracoid or acromion processes, or the scapular spine, are at fault rather than the osseous structimes of the joint itself, and extrac ion of the sequestra formed there may prevent excision of the articidation some cases a small sequestrum lying m a carious cavity in the head of t humerus may be removed by slitting up sinuses, without the necessity of excising the head of the bone. ^ -j. nor. When excision has been required for disease of the shoidder-joint, it ha usually been for caries commencing in the head of the humerus, especially 111 childi-en and young adidts. In these cases it ivill be usually found that the atfection is limited to the head of the bone, which is the part primarily attacked. The o-lenoid cavity mostly escapes entirely, or, if it be implicated, it is so secon- darily and to a veiy hmited extent. Although in malignant diseases excision has been practised, this operation is not usually advisable in such cases. Bickersteth has successfully removed the head of the humerus for exostosis. In cases of intracapsular fracture through the neck of the humerus, with detachment of the head of the bone, disorganisation of the joint has resulted. This has been laid open, and the loose head of the bone removed in two instances by Brainard of Chicago ; the patients recovering with useful limbs. Operation.—Paartial Excision of the head of the humerus in some cases of caries has been practised by shtting up sinuses and the application of the gouge to the diseased osseous siuface. Occasionally, as in cases reported by Fergusson and Sedillot, these operations have been attended by successful results. Bub not mifrequently they fail in effecting a cure, the disease extending, and the sinuses not healing, so that eventually excision of the whole of the diseased head of the bone has been requhed. Complete Excision of the head of the humerus is the operation usually requhed. It may be practised in several different ways—the lines of incision through the soft parts being varied according to the conditions of the case. They are alu'ays made on the front or outer side of the joint through the deltoid muscle, which must of necessity be more or less sacrificed. They consist of a single longitudinal vertical incision, and its modifications the ~[ and T shaped ones, and the elliptic (J or flap operation. The operation by the single longitudinal incision (Fig. 4I2) may be performed as follows. The patient lying on his back, the Surgeon enters the knife a little to the outside and above the coracoid process, and caiTies it do'wnwards for about four inches, cutting down to the bone. He then looks for the long tendon of the biceps, and if it be found still undestroyed by disease, he dissects it out from over the head of the humerus and has it held on one side with a blunt hook. The assistant then rotates the arm forcibly outwards, so as to bring the small tuberosity well into the wound, and the Surgeon divides the tendon of the subscapularis and the inner side of the capsule of the joint. The arm being now rotated inwards, the three muscles inserted into the great tuberosity and the outer part of the capsule are divided. The limb is now allowed to fall o'N’er the edge of the table, and the assistant forces the head of the bone up into the wound, whilst the Surgeon divides the posterior part of the capsule, and care- fully clears the upper end of the bone all round. Ho now takes the limb in his own hands and, having the soft parts well retracted, he pushes the head of250 EXCISION OF JOINTS. the bone out of the Avound so as to alloAV the easy application of the saw Ijy which it is removed. Should the parts aroimd the head of the bone bo thickened, unyielding, and infiltrated by plastic matter, more space may be gained by making a short cross cut at the upper end of the longitudinal incision, and thus coiwerting it into a modification of the “j or f. By this method of operating, the posterior circumflex artery and the circumflex neiwe are not divided, and but fcAV vessels will be found to require ligature. The fibres of the deltoid are little interfered with, and if the incision be not canded too loAV, the insertion of the pectoralis major Avill be at most only partially cut through. Should the extent of the disease or injury prove to be so great as to reqxiirc the amputation of the hmb, this may readily be done, as has been suggested by Spence of Edinburgh, by carrying the knife round the inner side of the limb, and so detaching the member, with due attention to those points in connection Fig. 442.—Excision of Shoulder-joiut. Loiigitucliiial Incision. Fig. 443.—SUnnii .after Aini>utition .at Slioulder- ° joint by Spence's inetbod. A\dth the axiUary artery that have been described at p. 74, vol. I. The result, as seen by the annexed drawing (Fig. 443), is very satisfactory. . The elliptical operation of excision may be performed in the tolloAvmg The articulation may also be readily exposed by making a semilunar flap about three inches in length, commencing at the posterior pai-t _ of the acro- mion, cutting across the line of insertion of the deltoid, and earned iip to the outer side of the coracoid process. By a few touches of ^ flap composed of the deltoid muscle may thus be raised, and c . articulation fully exposed.

After the operation, the flap must be laid down and re- tained in position by two points of sutme, and the arm well supported in a sling, the elbow especially . being raised. A pad should be placed in the axilla to prevent the tendency of the pectoralis major, teres major, and latissimus dorsi to draw the arm inwards. The union, which is by gTanulation, is usually slow, and must be conducted on ordinary principles. Result.—The shoulder-joint in its normal condition possesses five distinct movements ; 1. Rotation ; 2. Abduction and Elevation; 3. Adduction ; 4 and 5, movements in the antero-posterior direction. These movements vary greatly in importance in the course of the ordinary affairs of life. The most useful are those of abduction, and the two in the antero-posterior direction. These are Tccjuisite in aU ordinary trades and for the guidance of the hand in most of the common occupations of life. The movements of elevation are seldom required except by those who follow climbing occupations, as sailors, masons, &c. Kow the mode of performing the operation, as well as the operation itself, will materially influence these different movements. Thus, if the deltoid be cut completely across by means of an elliptical mcision, the power of abduction of the arm and of its elevation, will be permanently lost. If its fibres be merely split by a longitudinal incision (Fig. 442), they may be preserved or regained in great part. All those movements of rotation, &c., which are dependent on the actions of the muscles that are inserted into the tubercles of the humerus will be permanently lost; for, in all cases of caries of the head of the humerus requiring excision, the Surgeon ^vill find it necessary to saw through the bone below the tubercles—in its surgical and not in its anatomical neck. Hence the conneetions of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus, the teres minor, and subscapularis will all be separated, and their action on the bone after- wards lost. But those muscles which adduct and which give the antero- posterior movements, viz., the coraco-brachialis, the biceps, the pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, and teres major, will all be preserved in their integrity ; and hence it is that the arm, after this excision, is capable of guiding the hand in so gi’cat a variety of useful under-handed movements. In tlie case of a man whose shoulder-joint I removed many years ago, I last saw the patient about fifteen years after the operation had been performed, and then found252 EXCISION OF JOINTS. that the upper end of the humerus had been drawn up underneath and between the acromion and coracoid processes, Avhere a false joint had formed. The arm was extremely useful, and all the parts below the elbow were well de- veloped. The upper arm was shortened by two and a half inches. Excision of the shoulder-joint is on the whole a very successful operation, as regards life as well as limb. Hodges has collected 50 cases of excision of the head of the humerus for disease : of these, 8 died and 42 recovered from the operation. Of these 8 deaths, 8 only occurred before the third month, and 3 were from phthisis. In 2 only of the cases did the deaths appear to have been directly occasioned by the operation. In but 17 of these 50 cases Avas the glenoid cavity interfered with; but it is a. remarkable circumstance that in no fewer than 7 out of the 8 fatal cases this caAuty was diseased, and re- quired either gouging, excising, or cauterisation. Thus it would appear that the chance of a fatal termination is greatly increased by the implication of the glenoid cavity. 2. Excision for Compound and Comminuted Fracture.—I\Tien exci- sion of the shoulder-joint is required for compound and comminuted fractm-e from gun-shot injiuy, the operation is of a less formal character. The buUet- holes must be laid freely open in a longitudinal direction, or the deltoid even cut across at its superior attachment, all loose sphnters removed, and the ragged and spiculated ends of bone cut off with pliers or narrow saw; especial care being taken in manipulating towards the inner and imder sides of the joint, in the A'icinity of the plexus of nerves and large vessels. Without going back to the earlier cases of Percy, Lan-ey, and other military Surgeons of the latter part of the last centmy, who frequently practised this operation AAuth the happiest results, the more recent experience of the wars in Em-ope and America demonstrated its great utility, and that it ought inA^ariably to be preferred to amputation at the shoulder-joint in aU cases in which the large blood-A'essels and nerves are intact. Hodges states that in 96 recorded cases fr’om aU sources there were 25 deaths, or a mortality of 26 per cent. But in the Crimean AA^ar the result was much more satisfactory. Thus Baudens relates 14 cases occurring in the Crimea, with only 1 death ; and in the British army, of 14 cases, 12 recovered; AA^hilst of 60 amputations at the shoulder- joint 19 AA^ere fatal. In the American AAmr, the mortality in 5/5 cases of excision of the shoulder-joint AA'as at the rate of 32‘5 per cent. Prmary excisions Avere more successful than secondary : the percentage of mortality in the former (252 in number) being 23’3, and in the secondary (39b in number) 38*G Excision or the Scapula, partial or complete, may be required for caries, necrosis, or tumour of that bone. Caries and necrosis do not A'ery commonly affect the scapula primarily, men the bone becomes the seat of these diseases, it A\dll generally be found that the acromron and the spine are the parts affected. In such cases the progr-ess of disease is usually very sIoav, arre it will generally be found that the carious bone may be effectually gouged orrt, or the sequestrrrm extracted, by laying open sinuses, arrd thus exposing y irregrrlar arrd informal operations the diseased osseous surfirce. ihe_ Avlro e bone has, hoAvever, become affected by rrecrosis, dry caries, and c romc in am mation to an incurable extent. In two instances the Avhole bone has been253 rARTIAL EXCISION OF SCAFULA. excised for disease of this kind follomng caries of the Immcrus. The operators were Rigaud of Strasbui^, and i^e pre!e°rttTmro?^n^^ after removal of the scapula is a matter of very eonsideLble importance. The Savgeou who first ventured on t e «ra- tion of Removal of the Whole Scapula was Gumming, in 1808. Gaetam Bev in 1880, first amputated the arm and then proceeded to extirpate the shoulder-blade. In 1810 Liston removed the whole of the upper two-thiids of the scapula from a lad without sacrificing the arm. In 1828 Luke renmved nearly the whole of the scapula from a girl of fourteen for malignant disease, sawin" across the bone through its neck and the root of the acromion, and thus leaving the glenoid cavity and the acromion process. Hayman, Janson, Wiitzer and Textor have all performed similar operations, removing the gTcater’part of the bone, but leaxung the glenoid cavity and more or less of the parts above the spine. In 1837 Mussey (U.S.) excised the whole of the scapula and the clavicle for an enormous osteo-sarcoma ; the patient, a man, was, according to Gross, in excellent health fifteen years after this operation. In 1850 Gross removed the whole of the scapula, with the exception of the "lenoid cavity by sawing through the neck of the bone, for an osteo-sarcoma weighing seven pounds. Indeed, the American Sm'geons haxe distinguished themseh’es highly in this department of surgery. Thus, in 1838, McClellan removed the whole of the scapula with the clavicle for encephaloid disease, but the patient died. In two cases Gilbert (U.S.) removed the scapula, hall of the clavicle, and the upper extremity, one patient living a week, the other three months, after the operation. In 1845 Mussey successfully operated by the removal of the scapula, the outer half of the clavicle, and the upper extremity. In the case of Gross, the only portion of the scapula left attached to the upper extremity was the glenoid cavity. In 1856 Syme went a step further in this dnection, and, by disarticulating the bone instead of sawing tlu’ough its neck, removed the scapula with all its processes entire fr’om a woman seventy years of age, also leaving the arm untouched. Since that period complete removal of the scapula, leaving the arm untouched, has been done several times by Syme, Jones of Jersey, Cock, Fergusson, PoUock, and others. The arm so left becomes useful, capable of performing all the under- hand movements and of lifting considerable weights ; and it may now' be looked upon as an established rule in surgery that it should never be disarticu- lated unless it be the seat also of disease, rendering necessary that addition to the excision of the scapula. Fergusson prefers sawing through the root of the acromion to disarticulating that process, so as to give greater roundness to the shoulder and to preserve the attachment of the trapezius. Partial Excision of the Scapula has usually been practised for tumours of that bone. The extent of bone requiring excision will necessarily -s'ary greatly according to the size and character of the tumour, and the ser'erity of the operation Avill mainly depend upon whether it is the upper or the lower portion of the bone that is the seat of disease. AVhon the tumour is formed of a fibroid or osseous structure and situated towards the lower angle of the bone, it may be exposed by a crucial orT-shaped incision, and the body of the bone sawn through transversely below its neck and spine. In such cases theEXCISION OF JOINTS. 254 luemorrhagc need not be very great, as the main trunk of the subseapular artery, or oven the dorsal artery of the scapula, is not necessarily divided. If tlie tumour spring from and be connected with the spine and acromion, only projecting forwards over the shoulder and leaving the rest of the bone sound, and the joint unaffected, it may be freely exposed, the spine of the scapula j sawn or cut across with pliers, and the mass turned off from the point of the | shoulder, without injury to the articulation or the implication of vessels of any importance. j When the tumoim occupies the upper half of the scapula, the case is much more formidable, and the line of practice to be adopted must depend upon the j parts involved. If the disease involve the body of the bone, encroaching upon j the supra- or infra-spinous fossa, extending forwards into the axilla below the j neck of the scapula, and thus coming into relation with the subscapular artery, it would be wiser to remove the whole bone, than to attempt the resec- tion of the upper half, leaving only the lower angle, which would be useless to the patient. Ilffien the body of the scapula is involved in a morbid growth, extending over the greater part or whole of the subscapular or infraspinous region, and stretching forwards under the latissimus dorsi muscle into the axilla, the case becomes infinitely more serious, as not only must the whole of the scapula be removed, but the subseapular artery must be divided, and the axUlary plexus of nerves and vessels brought into the field of operation. In these cases, also, the question as to the preservation or removal of the arm has to be considered. Whenever the joint is sound, and the upper part of the limb free from disease, it should be preserved ; and, as these conditions usually exist where the disease originates in the scapula, the contemporaneous or antecedent amputation of the arm is seldom required. Operation.—Excision of the scapula may be performed by exposing the bone freely by means of crucial or T incisions, extending from the acromial end of the clavicle across the body and to the lower angle of the scapula. The flaps thus formed are then dissected up and turned back, the acromio-clavicular articulation, the clavicle itself, or the base of the acromion, is then to be cut thi’ough, the shoulder-joint opened, and the muscles attached to the coracoid process divided. The Surgeon may now adopt one of two courses; either dissecting at once down into the axilla, dividing and seeming the subseapular artery ; or he may cut across the muscles attached to the upper and back part of the scapula, pass his hand under the bone and draw it forwards, then com- plete the division of its axillary attachments, thus reserving the most critical stage of the operation to the last, and having the bone more fully exposed and more completely under control than when the opposite course is pursued and the operation commenced at the axillary border. In this operation the hcemor- rhage is necessarily copious, and may be dangerous. In one of the earliest cases of removal of a portion of the scapula, in which Liston removed the upper part of that bone for a vascular tumour, the bleeding was Irightful, and was only aiTCsted by most energetic measiues. In all cases in which the whole of the scapula is removed, the hemorrhage must necessarily be considei’ablc.

The critical part of the operation consists in the di^•ision of the subscapular artery. This should be reserved for the last part of the operation ; as the vessel is cut, it should immediately be seized by an assistant and tied at once. _ , . , , i i. i The after-dressing of the large wound left is simple, and is to bo conducted on ordinary principles, the flaps being laid down and retained by a few points of suture. , ^ i Result.—The result of the operation is satisfactory, by flir the larger pro- portion of patients on whom it has been practised having made quick recoveries from the operation, oven though some have succumbed at an early period to a recurrence of the disease for which it was practised. Indeed, the danger is much less than might at first be supposed from an operation of such magnitude. Clavicle.—The clavicle may require to be partially or wholly excised. In caries or necrosis of this bone, portions of it may be gouged away oi extracted without much difficulty, the bone being rarely affected through its whole thick- ness, and its posterior part consequently not requiring removal; but when, in consequence of the growth of tumoiu’s, the removal of the whole or greater part of the bone is required, the operation is one of the most hazardous in surgery, as a glance at the anatomy of the parts lying beneath the bone, and encroached upon by the morbid growth, will indicate. In 1828 ^lott excised the clavicle for an osteo-sarcoma which measured four inches in diameter. This operation was one of great difficulty ; it occupied four hours in its performance, and forty ligatm'es were required to restrain the haemorrhage. The subclavian vein, thoracic duct, and phrenic nerve were exposed, but the patient made a good recovery, and was alive many years after the operation had been performed. Similar operations, but not perhaps of quite so formidable a character, have been performed by Warren, Travers, Curtis of Chicago, Cooper of San Fran- cisco, and other Surgeons. It is obviously impossible to lay down definite rules for the performance of an operation in which the circumstances must vary so greatly in each case as in this, and for the safe conduct of which the Surgeon must be mainly indebted to his anatomical knowledge. It may be stated generally that the bone requires to be exposed by a free incision along its whole length : it is then sawn across or disarticulated at its acromial articulation, and carefully dissected out in a direction from without inwards, the sternal end being forcibly tivisted outwards, and its ligamentous connections carefully divided, care being taken to preserve the important vascular and nervous structures in the lower posterior cervical region, and to prevent the entry of air into any cut vein by the ligature of the vessel before its dinsion. The sternal end ouly of the clavicle has been excised by Davie of Bungay in a case in which dislocation backwards had resulted from deformity of the spine, and the luxated end, gradually pressing upon the cesophagus, threatened the life of the patient. The bone was cut through by means of a Key’s saw about an inch from its sternal end, and, the sterno-clavicular ligaments having been divided, the portion of bone was forcibly elevated, and at last extracted. Elbow-joixt.—In tracing the history of the introduction of excision of the elbow-joint into surgical practice, we find, as is the case in several other parts, that it was first partially and then wholly done for injury, and proposed by one Surgeon and eventually practised by another for disease.256 EXCISION OF JOINTS.

Justamond, of the T^'estminster Hospital, was the fii-st to operate in a case of disease : this he did in 1775, removing the olecranon and two inches of the ulna. Park proposed, but did not have an opportunity of practising, the complete cxtii’pation of the joint. This was done for the first time by Moreau, senior, in 1794, and again by Moreau, junior, in 1797. Tiittle was done from this time until the operation was revived by the Surgeons of Leeds ; in 1818 by Stansficld, in 1819 by Chorley and Hey. It then made rapid progTcss in professional estimation, and was specially largely iwactiscd by ♦Syme and Liston, and the Surgeons of the Edinburgh Infiimary. The excisionEXCISION OF THE ELBOW-JOINT. 257 of the elbow-joint has been more frequently practised than that of any other of the articulations, and the result has upon the whole been far more satis- This operation may be required, 1, for Chronic Disease of the Joint; 2, for Osseous Ankylosis ; and 3, for Compound Fractures and Dislocations. 1. In cases in which the elbow-joint requires to be excised for stiwnous disease in youns; persons, it will generally be found that, after morbid action has existed for considerable time in the joint, the limb will have become useless, and the soft parts aroimd the joint swollen, spongy, and perforated by fistulous openings. When disease of this joint occurs in the middle-aged adult, the mischiefwill usually be found to be principally seated in the bones, the articular structures being only secondarily involved. In these cases there wiU often be A-ery little external evidence of mischief, merely one or tAvo fistulous apertures leading down to carious or necrosed bone in the condyles or the olecranon, the joint being permanently flexed and SAVollen, and the arm so useless that it can- not support the weight of the hand. Oir exposing the articulation, perhaps caries, AAuth complete destruction of the cartilage, Avith or Avithout necrosis of the articular ends, and with loose pieces of dead bone lying in the holloAV of the olecranon, or in one of the condyles, may be found. Most commonly the radius is the last bone that is affected, the ulna and the articular end of the humerus being generally first diseased. 2. If osseous anlcylosis have occurred, Avhether in the straight or in the bent position, excision or simple division of a portion of the consohdated bone may advantageously be practised. This operation was first done in 1827, by Ehea Barton of Philadelphia. When the elbow is ankylosed in the straight position, the arm is quite useless ; and any operation by which flexion of the limb can be obtained, even Avithout mobihty of the joint, Avill add most materially to the patient’s comfort, rendering the hand available for most pui’poses of hfe. In cases of anrjular osseous ankylosis of the elbow, the bony union should be sawn across, or a wedge-shaped piece removed, so that an useful and movable articulation may be substituted for one that is rigid and fix;ed. 3. In cases of compound fracture or dislocation of the elbow-joint, more or less complete resection of the protruding, and possibly splintered fragments, may be required (pp. 416 and 489, Vol. I.). Operation.—Excision of the elboAV-joint may be performed by three differ- ent proccdiu’cs, A'iz., the H, the I—shaped, or the simple longitudinal incision. Each method has its advocates. The H-shaped operation consists in making an incision parallel to, and a little to the radial side of, the ulnar nerve, another along the outer side of the joint, and uniting the two by a cross cut, dissecting up and down two square flaps, and clearing the bones laterally. It Avas soon found by Sm’geons that by this method a very unnecessary amoimt of incision was practised ; and accordingly the vertical cut along the outer side Avas dispensed Avith, and the I—shaped operation necessarily adopted. This consists in making the longitudinal incision parallel to, and a little to the radial pde of the ulnar nerve, and the cross cut over the olecranon to the outer side of the joint.^ More recently still, it has been found that this incision may be still further simplified, and that the cross-cut may be entirely done away with, and the operation reduced to a single longitudinal incision carried nearly vm, TT J258 EXCISION OF JOINTS AND BONES. oyer the centre of this joint in the middle line from above downwards. In comparing these different methods of operating, I decidedly give the preference to the single longitudinal incision, as being quite sufficient in all ordinary cases for the complete and easy removal of the articulation. Should the soft structures towards the outer side of the joint not yield sufficiently, a cross cut can at once be made, so as to liberate them, and give the Surgeon more room, by turning up the two triangular flaps that will thus be formed. The following is a detail of the successive steps of the operation as practised by the 1—shaped or the single longitudinal incision. The arm being held across the chest, the perpendicular cut should be made parallel to, and a line or two to the outer side of, the ulnar nerve ; being commenced at least two inches Fig. 44C.—E.'ccision of Elt)Ow-joint: 1—shaped Incision. Fig. 44S.—Excision of Elbow-joint by Longitudinal Incision. / / /■ Fig. 447. — Excision of Elbow by 1—shaped Inci- sion. Bones exposed. Ulnar Nerve indistinctly seen. above the point of the olecranon, and caivied do\m to about three inches below it. The transverse incision may then, if necessary, be made directly across the end of the olecranon, to the outer side of the joint, and extended as far as the extremity of the outer condyle (Fig. 446). The two triangular flaps thus made must be dissected up, the knife being carried close to the bones (Fig. 447). Or the transverse incision may be dispensed -with, and the bones readily exposed and tiuned out by the third method, that of the single perpen- dicular incision (Fig. 448). This must be of sufficient length to allow of the sides being held well apart, and then it constitutes the simplest plan of excising the elbow that can well be devised. After the bones have been fairly exposed, they must be cleared to the inner side of the joint. In caiTying the incision in this direction, the edge of the knife should always be kept against the bones, and their sinuosities closely foUowed, so that the ulnar ner\e, being dissected out from behind the inner condyle, may escape _i^«ry. It i incision be properly planned, and the knife kept in contact nerve ought not to be exposed during the operation, more paiticulaily as it usullly embedded in a qLtity of plastic tissue. When the posterior part ofEXCISION OF THE ELBOW-JOINT. 259 the joint has been laid bai-e in this way, the knife should be carried roimd the tip of the olecranon, and this process removed by cutting-pliers. By forcibly bending the joint, pushing the forearm upwards, and lightly touching the ligaments with the point of the knife, the interior of the articulation will be fully exposed. By means of a small narrow saw, the articular end of the humerus is separated from the rest of the bone ; the upper end of the ulna and the head of the radius may either be removed in this way, or by means of cutting-pliers. There is never any necessity to place a spatula before the bones, as the parts of importance anterior to the joint could not easily be wounded, being completely protected by the brachialis anticus. The ulnar nerve vill occasionally, however, be in some danger, and it must be guarded or dravTi on one side by a bent copper spatula. Should any sinuses exist, espe- cially towards the inner side of the arm, they had better be left untouched. I have more than once known the ulnar nerve cut across by the Sm’geon in laying open what appeared to be very superficial sinuses in this situation. In this operation it is of great consequence, so far as the after-utihty of the arm is concerned, not to remove more of the bones lengthwise than is absolutely necessary ; the shaft of the humerus, for instance, should never be encroached upon, but it will be quite sufficient to limit the excision to the articular sur- face ; should any carious portions of bone extend beyond this, I think it is better to scoop them out with the gouge than to remove them in any other way. The excision of the ulna and radius should not be carried so low as to divide the insertions of the brachialis anticus and biceps. After opening the articulation, a practical question of considerable importance often arises ; viz., to what extent the resection of the articular ends should be carried. If they be aU diseased, there can of course be no doubt as to the propriety of removing the ends of the three bones. So, also, if the humerus and ulna be diseased, the head of the radius should be cut off on a level vfith the section of the ulna. But the important point is, whether, in the event of only one bone being- implicated, by disease or injury, the Surgeon should limit himself to the excision of this alone, or should remove the other two. Formerly, in accord- ance with the principle of conservative surgery, that diseased or injm’ed parts alone should be sacrificed, I have advocated leaving the healthy articular ends, and only removing that which was diseased ; but increasing experience has convinced me that the practice is erroneous, and that, if the joint be only partially excised, ankylosis is more apt to ensue than when the whole of the three articular ends are extiiqDated. I would therefore advise that, in cases of caries involving the elbow-joint, the whole of the articulation be removed, as well as in those cases in which operation is required in consequence of com- minuted and compound fracture of only one of the bones ; as, for instance, when the lower epiphysis of the humerus, or the upper end of the uhia only, is the seat of such injury. In excision of the elbow for faulty osseous ankylosis, a piece of the united bones about three-quarters of an inch to an inch in length should be sawn out; transverse, not wedge-shaped, cuts should be made, and the piece of bone removed must correspond to and include equal portions of humerus and of ulna. In some instances no vessels require ligature, though there may be free general oozing j but most commonly one or two must bo tied. In several cases,26o EXCISION OF JOINTS AND BONES it is said, the bleeding has proved extremely troublesome. This, however, I have never seen. After the operation, the limb should be laid upon pillows, nearly in the extended position, so that the cut portions of bones may be in close approximation with one another. If the excision have been practised through a single straight incision, there Avill be but little if any gaping of the wound, the flaps falling closely together. If any transverse cuts have been made, the edges cannot so readily be brought into apposition. At the end of a week or ten days, when granulations have sprung up, the arm may be put on a slightly bent leather splint, and, as the healing process goes on, this may gradually be flexed, until at last it is brought to a right angle. The flbrous union that takes place between the bones null be closer, and a more compact and useful false joint will form, than if the osseous sm’faces be too widely separated in the first instance, and be allowed to unite by a lengthened liga- mentous tissue. Until the contraction of the cicatrix has fully taken place, and the neighbouring tissues are quite firm, the joint should be supported by one lateral leather splint on the inner side of the arm. The splint should then be removed, the arm put in a sling, and passUe motion had recourse to, in order to prevent osseous ankylosis. Should there appear to be, as sometimes happens in children, a special tendency to this, the limb may be laid, before cicatrisation has taken place, upon a splint jointed opposite the elbow. Much of the success in the result of excision of this, as of other joints, wiU depend upon the care and attention bestowed on the after-treatment of the case. The position of the parts and the relation of the bones to one another should be scrupulously attended to, bagging of matter prevented, and exuberant granu- lations reiu’essed. At the same time, the patient’s strength must be kept up by constant attention to diet, fresh air, &c. In this way good liga- mentous union will take place. In two cases which I have had the opportunity of dissecting, one sixteen months and the other two years and a half after the operation, it was found that the ends of the bones were rounded and finnly united by a dense fibroid or ligamentous struc- ture. In this way a most excellent and useful limb will result, having the four movements of flexion, extension, pronation, and supination nearly perfect, with but little deformity, as may be seen by the accompanying cut (^ ig. 440), which Avas taken nearly two years after operation from a patient of A coachman, Avhose elbow-joint I excised, was able to driA’e, to hft a pail of Avatcr, and to do all the duties of his employment, nearly as well as if t c aiTu had retained its normal condition. • ^ _ Should recuiTcncc of disease take place, resection may e again lesoi c o with success. In one case, indeccl, which had been unsuccessfully operated on twice by other Surgeons, I excised the bones about the elbow foi the thiu time Avith complete success, remoAliig a consideiab e poition, ^ ^ inches, of the necrosed shaft of the humerus, and the canons iippei en ® ® radius and ulna. In this case, Avhich was that ol' a boy about fourteen jea Fig. 449.- Arm after Excision of Elbow.26i EXCISION OF THE RADIUS OR ULNA. of a"'0, complete reco^'el•y took place. He had a most iiselul arai, regaining the fom- movements of the joint, pronation, supination, flexion, and exten- sion, and this notwithstanding his being of a most striimous habit. Six moiiths after the excision he was obliged to have one thigh amputated for disease of the bone, and he eYcntiially died at the end of two . and a half years, of caries of the spine. Results.—Excision of the elbow-joint, so far as life is concerned, is a very successful operation. The result, when it is practised for compomid fracture or dislocation, has been abeady stated at pp. 41G, 489, Vol. I. AYhen practised for disease it is equally satisfactory; and indeed death can only occur from some unforeseen and accidental complication, such as may and does follou any operation. I have lost only one patient out of veiy many in whom I have excised the elbow-joint. The principal danger after this operation arises from ditfuse suppiu-ation of the medullary canal of the humerus. I have seen this happen in two fatal cases in the practice of others, phlebitis and pymmia de- veloping themselves in a secondary manner in both instailces ; and in a third, in which the patient lost his hfe, it is probable that death, which was attributed to pneumonia, remotely occurred from the same cause. The result, so far as utility of limb is concerned, is equally satisfactory. If proper cai-e be paid to the after-treatment, a strong arm, useful for all the piu-poses of life, uith an articulation capable of the foim normal movements of the joint, viz., flexion, extension, prouation, and supination. If the whole of the articular ends be excised, and if passive motion be employed, or the limb be kept suspended in a sling merely without splints after a few weeks have elapsed, ankylosis uiU but -very rarely take place. Should there be danger of this occiuTence, the patient should be put under chloroform, and forcible flexion and extension employed, or the limb placed on a sphnt with a hinge- joint and rachet apparatus, which will admit of its being moved daily by the Sm-geon; care being taken that it be kept flexed rather than extended. Undue mobility is rai-e ; I have never seen it foUow excision for disease, but have met Avith it in one case—that of a young woman, the lower end of whose humerus Avas completely disorganised by a fall, and the elbow-joint opened. In this case the loAver epiphysis of the humerus Avas excised, together with the articular ends of ^the ulna and radius. A good recovery took place ; but, although every care Avas taken to support the limb on splints, a A'ery movable joint AA'as loft. This I attributed to the whole of the lower epiphysis of the humerus haA'ing heen extirpated, and the union taking place betAA'^eon its shaft and the bones of the forearm in an imperfect manner. Ulxa or Radius.—One or other of the bones of the forearm has occasion- ally been excised with advantage, leaving a sufficiently useftd limb with good poAAcr in the hand. Carnochan of Now York and Jones of Jersey havn suc- cessfully excised the whole idna. In a case recorded, by Weist (U.S.) nearly the AAhole ulna was removed on account of gunshot Avouud. Care Avas taken to preserve as much as possible of the periosteum ; and reproduction of the bone, forming a very useful limb, had taken place at the end of a year. Butts of Virginia has removed the Avholc radius. In a Avoman ayIio Avas under my care about twenty years ago, I also resected successfully the Avhole radius, Avith the exception of its articular head, Avhich Avas sound (Fig. 451); and an usefulEXCISION OF JOINTS AND BONES. arm, of Minch the annexed figure is a good representation, was left (Fig. 450) Alter a time the hand gradually inclines towards the radial side of the arm i but, although the articulation between it and the forearm is but a slender one Fig. 451.—The Badius after Eemoval. through the medium of the ulna, a very useful memlier will be left. These operations do not require any specific rules for their performance ; the bone is exposed by a long incision in the direction of, and made by slitting up, the sinuses that biuTow amongst the muscles, and is then carefully dissected out from the parts amongst which it lies; especial care being taken to presen'e the periosteum and any new bony deposits that may already have been formed. In one case in which the elbow-joint ivas involved, and the radius diseased, m- stead of amputating the hmb I obtained an excellent result by the excision of the articulation as well as of the affected bone. The patient, a builder about thirty years of age, was able, foim years after the operation, to use his hand not only in all the ordinary piuqDOses of life, but also in his trade. The Olecranon has been successfully removed in some instances ; for dis- ease by Birkett of Guy’s Hospital; and on account of non-union after fractime by NeAvman of Stamford. In each case an useful arm Avas retained. Wrist.—Excision of the Wrist is an operation that has hitherto found less favoiu’ Avith Sm’geons than the removal of other joints. Two objections have been urged against it. The first is that, when the carphs is diseased, the morbid action very often rapidly extends, AAuth gveat constitutional irritation, to all the small bones that enter into its formation ; and although in some cases a few of these may hai'e been successfully taken aAA-ay, yet methodical excision of the whole of the joint has either been attended by persistence of the disease in the soft parts, or followed by a stiff and useless hand and arm. The second objection to excision of the Avrist consists in the superficial character of the articulation, and its close connection Avith the flexor and extensor ten- dons ; hence, Avhen the AAmund cicatrises, consolidation of these and of their sheaths is apt to result, and loss of that utility of hand, the preservation of Avhich should he the great object in the performance of the operation, is entailed. I had a case, hcAA'CA'cr, in 1858, in the person of a middle-aged man, in AA'hom the Avhole of the carpus and a portion ot the bases ot the metacarpal liones Averc rcmoA'cd, and Avho recoA'cred AA'ith a A’ery useful hand, AA’ith someexcision of the wrist. 263 power of flexing and extending the wrist, and with very considerable mobility of the fingers; and within the last few years the operation has been sereral times performed with more successful residts than had been anticipated. To Lister of Edinburgh, and West of Birmingham, is principally due the ment of showing the practicability of the operation. The mode of operating planned by the former of these Surgeons will be here described. But before mvincT the details of this operation, it may be well to mention the principles on which it is foimdcd. On looking at the movements of the VTist-jomt, ifc will be seen that they are far fewer and more limited than those of either of the other joints of the upper extremity. In fact, they are but two in number, viz., flexion and extension, and flexion can rarely be carried to a right angle. The hand as an organ may be perfectly useful though these movements be lost, and, when lost, they are supplemented by the antero-posterior movements of the elbow. But the hand cannot be left useful if the flexion and extension of the Angel’S be interfered with seriously. Now the essential principle of Lister s operation appears to me to consist in sa'vdng these, whilst those of the wrist aie necessarily sacrificed. If we look at the tendons that siu’round the wrist, we shall find them divisible into five groups : 1. Those special to the thumb ; 2. The extensors of the fingers; 3. The flexors of the fingers ; 4 and 5. The exten- sor’s and the flexors of the wist. Now the incisions are so planned as to save absolutely the whole of the first three groups, and only to divide the tendons of the wrist proper. Hence the result of the operation is to enable the patient to recover ivith good movement of flexion and extension in the fingers and of the thumb as an opponent to the hand, but with the comparatively slight inconvenience of a stiff wrist. Lister’s Operation.—From the result of two cases of severe injrn’y to the wrist-joint, which recovered with useful hands. Lister was led to the conclusion that, with proper after-treatment, the tendons about the wrist might be very freely handled without permanent stiffness necessarily resulting. At the same time, he hoped by remoHng the whole of the cartilaginous surfaces to be able to prevent recmrcnce of the disease—which is the common ending of cases of partial excision of the ^Yrist-joint for caries of the carpus. At the time when he published his papers, he had performed the operation of excision of the wrist fifteen times. The method of operating was essentially the same in all; various small details being altered as experience suggested. The opera- tion, as he now performs it, is done as follows. Before commencing, Esmarch’s bandage and tourniquet should be applied, as without them the oozing of blood interferes considerably Avith the operation. Any adhesions of the tendons then existing may be forcibly broken dowi by moving the joints. An incision is then made “ fi’om about the middle of the dorsal aspect of the radius, on a level with the styloid process, downwards and outwards towards the inner side of the metacarpo-phalangeal articulation of the thumb ; but, on reaching the line of the radial border of the metacarpal bone of the index finger, it is carried downwards longitudinally for half the length of that bone.” This incision should commence in the angle formed by the tendons of the common extensor of the fingers and the extensor secundi internodii pollieis, and the upper part should rim parallel to the latter teudon, but Avithout injuring it. The tendon of the extensor carpi radialis brevior Avill be cut, but that of theEXCISION OF JOINTS AND BONES. 264 longior vrill escape for the present, and the angle formed by the two parts of the incision should be close to the inner side of its insertion. If the first part of the incision be carried too far, there is danger of wounding the radial artery. The soft parts are then to be separated carefully from the bones on the radial side of the incision, the tendon of the extensor carpi radialis longior being now cut as close to its insertion as possible. The tendon of the extensor secundi in- ternodii pollicis and the radial artery are to be jmshed outwards out of the way. The trapezium must then be separated fr’om the rest of the carpus by cutting in the longitudinal part of the incision with the bone-forceps. The soft parts on the ulnar side of the radial incision are now to be dissected up as far as can Pig. 452.—Diagi-am of Wrist. A. Deeii Palmar Arch. U. Trapezium. C.

(Lister.) be conveniently done, the remainder being raised from the ulnar incision. "VATiile this is being done, the tendons must be relaxed by extending the joint. The trajpezium is not to be removed yet, as any attempt to dissect it out before removing the rest of the carpus would endanger the radial artery and the ten- don of the flexor carpi radialis. The ulnar incision is now to be made. It must be a free incision, commencing at least two inches above the end of the ulna and immediately to the palmar aspect of the bone, and caiT’ied directly downwai’ds between the flexor carpi ulnaris and the ulna, and then straight on as far as the middle of the pahnar aspect of the fifth metacarpal bone. The tendons and soft parts on the dorsum of the carpus are now to be completely raised. In doing this the tendons must be relaxed, and they are to be raised as little as possible fr'om the radius or metacarpus. The extensor carpi ulnaris is to be cut as near its insertion as possible, and the dorsal and internal lateral liga- ments may now be divided. Then the soft parts are to be raised from theexcision of the wrist. 265 palmar aspect. The knife must be carried close to the ulna, so as not to wund the artery and nerve. The pisiform bone is to be separated and lel’t attached to the tendon of the flexor carpi uluaris, which is not to be cut. ihe flexor tendons are to be raised from the metacarpal bones, but in doing this the hook of the unciform bone must be clipped off with the bone-forceps, and care must be taken not to cut below the bases of the metacarpal bones, for fear of wounding the deep palmar arch. The tendons must be relaxed diu-ing this part of the operation by flexing the -VTist. The bone-forceps may now be introduced, first between the carpus and radius, and then between the carpus and metacarpus ; by this means the Avhole of the carpal bones (except the trapeziimi and the pisiform bone) are separated from their connections, and may be extracted in one mass with a larger pair of sequestrum-forceps, any bands which retain them being touched with a knife. The ends of the radius and ulna may now be easily protruded from the ulnar wound. If on examination they be found only slightly diseased, the ulna may be saivu obliquely so as only to remove its articular surface and to leave almost the whole of the styloid process. A thin slice may be taken off the end of the radius, so as only just to remove the cartilaginous surface ; and its articular surface for the ulna may be removed by cutting longitudinally with the bone- forceps. By leaidng the ulna as long as possible and by saving the styloid process, the tendency to displacement to the ulnar side is somewhat counteracted. If the bones be extensively diseased, the gouge and boue-phers must be used •freely. The next step is to expose the bases of the metacarpal bones, and to treat them in the same way as the radius and uhia, saving as much bone as possible, but removing all cartilaginous surfaces. The second and third are most easily protruded from the radial, and the fourth and fifth fr'om the ulnar wound. The trapezium may then be dissected out, being held in a strong pair of forceps. In doing this care must be taken, first, not to woimd the radial artery, which is in close relation with its outer side ; and, secondly, not to cut the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis which lies in its gToove. When the trapezium is removed, the base of the metacarpal bone of the thumb may be jDHshed up and cut off with the bone-pliers. It is better to remove it, as it may suffer from recm’rence of the disease, and by its removal the thumb is reduced in length to the same extent as the fingers. Lastly, the pisiform bone may be examined, and either removed entirely, or its cartilaginous siuface cut off, as the case requires. Dmlng the operation, the only tendons necessarily divided are the extensors of the 'wi’ist. The flexor carpi radialis may escape, fr’om its attachment being situated low on the bases of the second and third metacarpal bones, and the flexor ulnaris is left attached to the pisiform bone. AU the extensors of the thumb should be uninjured. All the tendons necessarily divided must bo cut as long as possible, so that they may form new attach- ments in the most advantageous positions ; and, in raising the flexor and extensor tendons they must be distiubed as little as possible. A/ler-lreafment.—The radial wound maybe closely united with sutures. The ulnar woimd may be closed at each end, but the middle of the wound is to be kept open by means of an india-rubber di’ainage tube to allow fine exit of discharge. Ihe hand is to be placed on a splint. The most convenient is a simple wooden splint, “with an obtuse-angled piece of thick cork” stuck on it so as to maintain266 EXCISIOJ^ OF JOINTS AND BONES. the hand in a state of semi-flexion, with the wrist slightly extended (Fio- 454) The thumb is supported by a bar of cork stuck on the under surface so' as to project at the side (Fig. 455). The two great objects in after-treatment are to get the Angers perfectly movable and the wrist Arm. For these purposes Fig. 454.—Lister’s Splint with Cork Support for Haiul. Fig. 455.— Haiul after Excision of Wrist, laid on Splint. passive motion must bo commenced as early as the second day in the Angers, each being bent and extended every day fully, whAe the wi-ist is kept flrmly on the splint and disturbed as httle as possible Wing the treatment of the Angers. Pronation and supination must not be too long neglected. Passive motion must be maintained as long as there is any tendency to the formation of adhe- sions in the sheaths of the tendons. As the hand becomes stronger, the part of the sphnt supporting the Angers may be cut off. The patient must continue some support as long as he feels any weakness in the wrist. There is often some tendency to dropping of the wrist to the ulnar side, which is best counter- acted by a properly constructed gutta-percha splint. The thumb is apt to be drawn in towards the index Anger ; this must be i^revented by a thick pad of lint kept from the earliest time between the two. The essential jioints are, fli’st, exact attention to all the details of the opera- tion, and next, a careful and patiently conducted after-treatment. Results.—Since Lister described his method of operating, excision of the wrist for disease has in several instances been practised successfiiAy by TYest (flve cases), G-illespie, and other Surgeons. In military surgery, however, ac- cording to the statistics of the iVmerican wai’, the resiAts of the operation have been far from encouraging in regard to the amoimt of mobility left to the hand. Haxd.—In the rcmo^'al of diseased or injured portions of the hand, it is, as a general rule, of the greatest importance to sacriflce as little as possible of the healthy or uninjured structures. In all operations on the hand, indeed, we must have two gveat principles in view—the preservation of the utility of the member, and the maintenance, so far as practicable, of its symmetryUtility is necessarily the primary consideration ; but if a part be not useful, it may, as in the case of the head of the middle metacarpal bone in amputation of the corresponding Anger, be sacriflced for the purpose of preserving the symmetry of the maimed limb. The hand is the organ of and of touch; and267 COXSEllVATIVi: SUBGERY OF TILE FINGERS. ill 111! opci'tvtioiis ivpplicd to it wc should cudcayoui', as far as practicable, to maintain its efficiency in both these respects. It is also of importance to bear in mind that two groat classes of actions can be carried out by the hand— those that require force, and those that require delicacy of manipulation rather than strength. By a surgical operation we may sometimes succeed in preserv- ing one, though we are compelled to sacrifice the other ; and in this respect, our procedure should be a good deal infiuenced by the occupation of the patient. Thus, by partial excision, wc may leave a hand that ^vould enable a clerk to hold his pen, but which would be almost useless to a labourer or blacksmith. In looking at the hand from a surgical point of view, we may consider it as being composed of two constituents—the hand proper, and the Thimh; the thumb being an accessory hand, an opponent to the rest of the member, through the mediiun of which the movements of ab- and ad-duction are chiefiy performed, and without which the member is susceptible of a comparatively limited utility, being capable of httle beyond fiexion and extension. Hence the thumb is of equal importanee to the rest of the hand : and the preservation of its three bones is as much to be considered as that of the remaining sixteen that enter into the conformation of the metacarpus and fingers. In all cases of injury or disease implicating the thumb, every effort ought to be made for its preser\'a- tion. Even if it be left stiffened and incapable of flexion, it will be a most useftil opponent to the rest of the hand. Should it be found necessary to shorten it, care must be taken that as little curtailment as possible be prac- tised : a portion of a phalanx, or its metacarpal bone even, is of essential utility in giving strength and breadth to the grasp of the hand. In cases of disease, a verj^ useful member may be left by the removal of a portion or the whole of the ungual phalanx, of the metacarpo-phalangeal articulation, or even by the excision of the metacarpal bone, the phalanges being left. These various operations are easy of performance ; an incision through the diseased and dis- organised soft parts will expose the necrosed bone or carious joint, which must be removed by cutting-pliers or a narrow saw. When the thumb has been forced back, or badly lacerated by powder-flask or gim-baiTcl explosions, it may often be saved by being replaced and main- tained in position on a splint, with light water-dressing over it; and, should amputation be required, it must be done in accordance with the rule just mentioned, of saving as much as possible of the injured part. In the conservative surgery of the ringers the preservation of flexion and extension in the part left is the main thing to be aimed at; a rigid stump is always in the way.^ The preservation of these movements becomes more im- portaiff m proportion as the palm is approached. It is of more consequence that the proximal phalanx, which carries the rest with it, should be capable of being bent into the palm, than that the distal can be flexed on the second. If the proximal phalanx can be bent down, a ^•cry small degree of movement in the distal one will be sufficieut to furnish pliability enough in the finger to make It an useful member ; but if the proximal one be stiffened, no amomit of mobility m the distal phalanx can make it useful. In preserviug these movements, it is necessary to be particularly careful of the sheaths of the tendons. If they be in any way opened or injured, it will ,,eneially be found either that the tendon sloughs, or that it becomes con-EXCISION OF JOINTS AND BONES. 268 soliclateci, and matted to its sheath in such a way that all movement is lost, or at least greatly impaired. The only phalanx that can be excised with advantage is the distal one. It often happens, in the destructive disorganisation which results from whitlow, that this necroses ; when, instead of amputating the end of the finger, it may be remo\-cd by an incision on its palmar aspect. Disease of the phalangeal articulations usually leads to amputation of the afiected finger. The rides for performing these 'v arious operations have afready been laid down at pp. G2 ct set}., Vol. I., to which I must refer the reader. Itesection of the Metacarpal Bone, either of the thumb or index finger, Avithout the remoA'al of the coiTesponding digit, is occasionally required, more particularly in cases of injury ; it may readily be done by making a longitudinal incision over the dorsal aspect of the bone to be removed, carefully detaching it fr’om surrounding parts by keeping the edge of the knife close against the bone, avoiding the tendons, and then either disarticulatmg, or (Avhat is pre- ferable) cutting across the neck of the carpal end of the bone, turning it out, and separating it from any distal attachments which it may retain. After the removal of the metacarpal bone of the index finger in this way, but little deformity results, and a very useful hand wiU be left, more particularly in children, on whom I have more than once had occasion to practise this partial resection AAuth success. If the periosteum be saved, the bone may be to some extent reproduced, but in order to obtain this result it is necessary to keep the finger draAvn forwards by an elastic extending apparatus, to prevent the first phalanx from being pulled back on to the carpus by the muscles attached to it. CONSERVATIVE SURGERY OP THE LOWER EXTREMITY. In all conservative operations that are practised on the lower extremity, it is of essential importance that a good basis of support, of sufiicient length and stability, be left to the body. These operations differ thus in some important resj)ects fr’om those that are practised on the upper extremity. In the latter, the preservation of the hand, even though in a mutilated condition, is the thing at Avhich the Surgeon aims ; and, provided this be attained, it matters com- parath'ely little hoAV much the arm may be shortened or impaired in poAver. In the lower extremity, however, strength, length, and solidity are essential to the patient’s comfort and utility, aud unless these can be secm’ed, his interests are better served by the remoAml of the limb, and the adaptation of some artificial contrivance, than by leaving a shortened, wasted, and crippled mem- ber, Avhich is unequal to support the Aveight of the body. Hip-JOINT.—Excision of the head of the thigh-bone has of late years been a good deal practised in some cases of hip-joint disease. This operation may, hoAvever, most conveniently be considered in connection AAuth that affection (Chapter LII.). Knee.—Excision of the knee-joint may be required either as a substitute for amputation in cases of extensive disease and disorganisation of the articula- tion, or may be practised in some rare cases of faulty ankylosis resulting old disease or injury, by which the limb has been rendered useless. ^ operation, originally pei'formed at the close of last century by Paik, hilkin, and the Moreaus, fell into disfaA'our until it was revived in 1850 by Forgusson, since which time it has been extensiA'cly practised.269 EXCISION OF THE KNEE-JOINT. Operation.—Excision of the knee-joint may be performed by making a horse-shoe incision with the convexity do^rawards, from the side of one condyle of the femnr across the tuberosity of the tibia to a coiTcspondmg point on the opposite condyle (Fig. 450). By this incision the ligamentum pa- telliB is divided, and that bone turned up in the elliptical flap ; the crucial ligaments, if not aheady disorganised, are then to be cut across, any remaining lateral attachments divided, and the bones cleai’cd for the saw. In doing this the limb must be forcibly flexed, and the knife carefiilly applied to the posterior part of the head of the tibia ; for this purpose a blunt-pointed re- section-knife is the best. The articular surfaces must now be SaAVn off This may be done by ^OO.—Elllptinal Tudsion in Exelsiou of the Knee-ioiut. Butcher’s saw, but in order to ensm-e a perfectly smooth section of the bones, many Surgeons prefer to use a common saw somewhat broader than that ordi- narily emifloyed in amputations. The lower end of the thigh-bone should first be removed, and then a slice taken off the tibia by cutting from behind forwards Fig. 4J7.—Application of Butcher’s S.aw to Head of Tibia. Fig. 45n.—Upper End of Tibiti, excised. Fig. 45S.—Lower End of Femur, excised. (Fig. 457), the blade of the saw being turned horizontally ; care should be taken not to remove more bone than is absolutely necessary, lest the limb be too much shortened. It not unfrequeutly happens that carious cavities are found, extending IjcIow the level of the section that has been made ; when270 JLXOISION OF JOINTS AND BONES. this is the case, it is better to aj^ply the gouge to them than to saw the bone below their level. It is usually sufficient to remove from one-third to three- fourths of an inch of the tibia, and about one inch or an inch and a half of the thigh-bone (Figs. 458 and 459). Should, hoAvever, the operation be perfonned for disease of the limb, consequent upon the deformity resulting from badly reduced fractures or dislocations about the knee, as has been done successfully by Humphry of Cambridge, it may be necessary, in order to bring the limb into good position, to remove a wedge-shaped piece from one of the bones. If the patella be much diseased, it must be removed ; if it be only slightly carious, it may be scraped or gouged out; and if healthy, in accordance with that principle of conservative surgery by which no sound part is removed, it should be left, becoming consolidated with and strengthening the joint. The anterior articular surface of the thigh-bone, which extends some way up its forepart, may advantageously be sliced off, so as to leave an osseous siuface, instead of a cartilaginous one, for the attachment of the patella. In some cases no ligatures will be required, but usually two or three of the articular arteries furnish sufficient haemorrhage to require restraint. The patella flap when laid down will often appear inconveniently long and thick ; but it is better not to curtail it, unless the bones haA'e been shortened more than usual, as it will contract and eventually fit well. I have always found the operation, as it has just been described, easy of per- formance and good in its results ; but various modifications are adopted by different Siu’geons. Thus, some make one straight transverse incision ; others two parallel incisions, one on each side of the patella, or an H-shaped inci- sion, and thus open the articulation from the side. Jones of Jersey, who had great experience in this operation, advised that the skin be dissected up by means of a semilunar incision, and then that the ligamentum patellte be preserved by being pushed with the patella and the quadriceps extensor tendon to one side, the joint then opened, and the bones sawn. Others advise that the patella be removed; and Holt has recommended that, after the excision, the soft parts of the ham be perforated to allow the discharges to drain through. The result of the operation AviU mainly depend on the care taken in the after-treatment. After the operation, the limb should be at once put up securely in a Liston’s sphnt, and well supported. Subsequently, when gianula- tions spring up, it may most conveniently be placed in a long leather trough, extending from heyond the foot to the pelvis, and well padded; paiticulai attention being paid to the position of the limb, and especially to the pre- vention of any bowing outwards which is apt to take place. ^ In order to prevent displacement, it has been proposed to diAude the hamstring tendons ; this, however, I have never found necessary, nor docs it seem to me to be ad\isable to complicate the operation by such an addition to it. The pro- tuberance of the flap, if at all excessive, may be diminished by the pressure o a many-tailed bandage. In this way osseous ankylosis will ensue, and a good and useful sfraight limb result. In two cases I have succeeded in getting a good limb with a partially movable joint; both these cases were in diddrcn ; and I am disposed to think that in young patients this icsn t ^ TLvq satisfactorily attained. In adults, however, osseous ankylosis should awn,.271 RESULTS OF EXCISIOF OF KNEE-JOINT. be aimed at. Amongst the A'arioiis contrivances that have at different times been adopted for the treatment of diseases of the knee-joint, before or after excisions, there is none that appears to be so simple and yet so ingenious as that constructed by H. 0. Thomas, as represented in Figs. 4G0 and 401. This apparatus keeps the limb totally at rest, Avhilst it enables the patient to move about, as in Fig. 461. In walking, the weight of the body is borne by the Fig. 400.—Thomas’s Knce-SiOint.

In 1857, according to Butcher, excision of the knee-joint had been performed H2 times since its revival in 1850. Of these cases 15 proved fatal, and in 8 amputation of the thigh was required, of which 1 case had a fatal issue. In some instances there is reason to believe that the unsuccessful result was owing to want of due attention to the after-treatment of the case. Price has collected the particulars of ICO cases of excision of the knee performed up to December, 1858 : of these, 32 were fatal—8 from pyaemia ; and to these must be added (iO cases collected by Clarke of Bristol, of which 0 died—1 fi’om pyaemia ; in all 220 cases with 38 deaths. Penieres, writing in 18C9, gives the statistics of GOO cases in which excision of the knee had been performed. Of 431 cases operated on for disease, 300 recovered and 131 died—a mortahty of 30 per cent. The result of excision for gimshot injury has already been alluded to at p. 235, Yol. I., as generally unsatisfactory. On comparing the mortality after amputation of the thigh -with that follow- ing excision of the knee-joint, some statistics show no very material difference in the rate of mortality after the two operations. In 18G9, Swain foinid that, in 472 cases of excision of the knee-joint collected by Price, Mac Cormac, and himself, there were IIG deaths, or 24-5 per cent. ; while in 54 amputations of the thigh there were 13 deaths, or 24 per cent. Other recent statistics, again, show decidedly in favour of excision. Y^illett has collected the cases that occurred at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital during a period of six years. He finds that of 38 cases of excision 8 proved fatal; whilst of 84 cases of amputation of the tliigh for disease no fewer than 37 died—shovdng a preponderance in favour of excision over amputation in the ratio of 21 against 44 per cent, of deaths. Bryant, however, says that the mortality after the two operations varies much according to age. Thus, among patients under 20 years of age, in G9 amputations of the thigh for disease of the knee, 3 only died, while of 97 cases of excision, 27 died ; in 119 amputations between the ages of 20 and 40, 38 died, while of 74 excisions, 39 died. He hence concludes that during the earlier period of life excision is afar more fatal operation than amputation; whilst at more advanced ages, though stiff more fatal, the balance in fa\ oui of amputation is less striking. _ 2. The second point that has to be determined, is as to the btihUj oj me Liml) after the Operation. _ j.- t On this point, the result of recorded cases is in favoin- of the operation, in one of Park’s cases, operated on in 1783, that Surgeon states that the patient (a sailor), seven years after the operation, “was able to go aloft able agility, and to perform hll the duties of a seaman.” In some of the lattci cases the result has been equally good. One of Jones’s patients (a boy) “ could run and walk quickly without any aid of a stick, could stand on t limli alone, and pirouetted and hopped two or three yards without putting tne273 EXCISION OF THE BONES OF TUE LEG. sound limb to the gi’Oimd.” In several of mj o^vn cases an excellent strong and straight limb has been left, useful for all ordinary purposes. In a case ■which I examined seven years after the operation, the limb was well nourished, straight, firmly ankylosed, and but very little shortened. The patient, a lad of twenty, could walk eight or ten miles, and even jump and stand on the operated limb without the least pain, sign of weakness, or difiiculty. In very young children the result of the operation is not satisfactory, the leg continuing shortened and wasted, not developing -with the rest of the body. This is appa- rently due to and dependent upon the removal of the epiphysis of the tibia, on the integrity of which the growth of the limb is dependent. After the operation, osseous anlcylosis takes place with a firm cicatrix ; the hmb is shortened from one to three inches, according to the amount of bone removed, but by means of a high-heeled shoe this inconvenience is greatly remedied. It has been urged against excision of the knee-joint, that convales- cence is tedious and prolonged ; but this argument can rvith justice have but little weight. If an useful limb can be preserved to the patient, it can matter but little if a few additional weeks be devoted to the procedure by which it is obtained ; and, indeed, it is a question whether in many cases the patient may not be able to walk just as soon after the excision of the knee-joint as after amputation of the thigh : for, as has been very properly remarked, though the amputation-wound may be healed in three or four weeks, it may be as many months before an artificial limb can be worn. On^ the whole I think it may be fairly said that, although excision of the knee-joint may in some cases leave an excellent result, and thus be preferable to amputation, yet, when we consider the uncertainty of this result, the greater mortality attendant on excision than on amputation of the thigh for chronic disease of the knee-joint, especiaUy in the two earlier deinnial periods of life, we should practise excision as the exceptional operation, and I would still feel disposed to give the preference to amputation in the majority of cases. In addition to these considerations, there is an additional element which cannot altogether be discarded in enabling us to form a judo-ment as to the preferable operation. And it is this, that, in consequence of recent im- provements in surgical mechanics, artificial limbs are now constructed of so durable and useful a character, as to supply to a great extent the loss sustained by amputation and this more particularly if the limb have been removed eaidv m hfe, when the patient can more readily adapt himself to new methods of progression. Boxes of the Leg.-TIib Tibia is very frequently the seat of caries in the upper and lower epiphyses, and of necrosis in the shaft, requirino- partial sK'r portions. Occasionally a ?ery con- sideiablc extent of the shaft, indeed the whole of it, maybe remo-v-ed in a state tom strengthened bj the deposit of new bone.

After the operation an inner splint must be applied, in order to obviate the tendency to varus which will ensue. In the case from which the annexed drawings are taken, very considerable reparative action was set up in the periosteum and soft tissues along the line of bone that had been removed, new osseous matters apparently being deposited; and the child, when examined two years after the operation, had an excellent, well-nourished, and useful limb. The foot, however, had a tendency to be drawn inwards, apparently owing to the flexors having overcome the antagonism of the peroneal extensors. This de'^'iation inwards was counteracted by the patient wearing a properly constructed l)oot, with which walking w^as perfectly easy. Foot.—In looking at the division of the foot into its three great component parts—toes, metatarsus, and tarsus,—we shall perceive that firmness of gait is given by the foot resting on the heel behind, and on the ball in front formed by the projection of the broad line of the metatarso-phalaugeal articulations, more particularly that of the great toe ; whilst elasticity is communicated to the tread by the play of the toes and metatarsal bones. The elasticity of the foot may be lost Avithout any very serious inconvenience to the patient; but the preservation of stability and firmness of gait are of essential importance ; and as these are secirred by the heel, the baU of the great toe, and the bieadth of the anterior part of the foot, these are the most important parts to preserve in all resections of this part of the body. In no region of the body have the good effects of modern conservatn^e sur- o-cry been more distinctly showm than in the Tarsus. In the “ good old times of Surgeiy, if a person had a white swelling ” of the bones of the foot, or a diseased tarsus, he was at once condemned to amputation of the limb. Ao distinction Avas drawn betAA^een disease of the different parts of the foot, nor any attempt made to save the sound by the sacrifice of the diseased part.

This practice con- tinued to prevail until Chopart drew some distinctions between the treatment to be pursued, according as the disease affected the anterior or the postenor tarsal bones and articulations. He showed that, when the anterior articulations only were affected, amputation at the junction of the astragalus and calcaneum with the scaphoid and cuboid—an operation which goes by the name of “ Chopart’s amputation ’'—ought to be performed ; thus remo'sdng the whole of the disease, and allowing the patient to recover with a shortened foot, with the heel preserved—one on which he could bear the weight of his body, and which would be highly useful to him. The next step in the conservative surgery of the lower extremity, in cases of diseased foot, was the operation introduced by Syme—that of disarticulation at the ankle-joint. This was certainly a great advance ; for, the flap being taken from the heel, the patient has a stump on which he can bear. The operation is also a very safe one. According to 0. Weber, 17 deaths only have occiin-ed in 101 cases of this operation. I have performed it many times without a death, and this, in the lower extremity, is extremely satisfactory. Since the introduction of anmsthetic agents, Conservative Siirgeiy has taken great strides; and I think Conservatism in Surgery may be regarded as the nccessaiy result of Anmsthesia. For, although operations of this kind were performed years ago by Park, the Moreaiis, and others, and their utility demon- strated, yet the operations of gouging, scraping, and partial resection were so hon’ibly painful to the patient, and occupied so much time in their performance, that patients dreaded to submit to, and Surgeons declined to undertake, them. Of late years Surgeons have learned to discriminate disease of one part of the tarsus from that of another, and to apply appropriate treatment to each. Looking at the subject in a diagnostic point of view—and the treatment is most intimately connected with minute and accurate diagnosis—we find that the pathology of diseases of the tarsus is closely connected Avith its healthy anatomy. Composed of seven bones, it presents four distinct articulations. r>y the teim “ articulation,” applied to the tarsus, I do not mean merely the connection of contiguous bones with each other, but distinct synovial sacs shut off* from communication with other synovial sacs in the foot. These are well represented in the annexed diagram (Fig. 4G4). The posterior calcaneo-asira- (jnloul is tlie first of them ; next comes the {a) aniorior calcaneo'astragaloid, the synovial membrane here serving also for a'irngalo-scaphoU; the calcanea-EXCISION' OF JOINTS AND BONES. 276 culoid (&) IS the third ; and the anterior tarsal synovial mmilrane (c) is the touitli and largest of all, and the most important in a surgical aspect. It ex- tends between the scaphoid and the three cuneiform and the cuboid bones, l)e- tween the cuneiform bones themselves, between the two outer cuneiforms and the bases of the second and third metatarsal bones, and also between the external cuneiform and the cuboid. The articulation between the cuboid and last two metatarsal bones is shown at cl; and e is that between the internal cuneiform and the first metatarsal bones. These two {d and e) are not, strictly speaking, tarsal joints. In the vast majority of cases, so far as my experience goes, it is the osseous structures, and not the articulations, which are primarily diseased. The bones, being cancellous, far re- moved from the centre of circulation, and ex- posed to alternations of temperatm-e, readily become the seat of congestion and caries, but rarely of necrosis ; and in strumous subjects not unfrequently fall into a tuberculous condi- tion. Caries, whether simple or tuberculous, once set up in bones, speedily imjilicates the ar- ticulations secondarily. Now it will easily be understood, on casting an eye on the arrangement of the tarsal synovial membranes, that the extent of disease will, in a great measm-e, depend upon its original seat. Thus, a person may have disease in the os calcis, extending even to the cuboid, with very little likelihood of its pro- ceeding farther for a length of time. Such disease is hmited to the outer part of the foot, does not involve its integrity, and readily admits of removal by operation. But let him have disease springing up in the scaphoid, or in one of the cuneiform bones, or in the bases of the second or third metatarsal bones, and the morbid action wiU rapidly spread through the whole of the anterior and inner part of the tai'sns, and, in all probability, no operation of resection can be advantageously employed. Hence the seat of disease influences materially its amount and extent, and the kind of operation required. The foot is frequently the seat of strumous disease ; to this it is disposed by the alternations of temperature to which it is subjected, by its liability to sprains and injmles, and by the cancellous and spongy structure of its bones, together with its extensive articulating surfaces. When affected by striunous inflammation it becomes painful, the patient being unable to bear upon the toes or anterior ball of the foot. Swelling of an uniform character takes place, with tenderness at some point optposite the bones or articulations that are chiefly involved ; and eventually abscess forms, leaving sinuses through which the probe passes down uj)on softened and carious bone. These evidences of disease are usually much marked about the dorsum and sides, the sole being often comparatively fr’ee—an important jwint in reference to operation. Fig. 464.—^Diagram of Synovial Mem- branes of the Foot.EXCISION' OF TARSAL BONES. 277 Strumous disease may commence either in the bones, or in the articulations of the foot. The bones that are most frequently the seat of primary disease are the calcaneum, the astragalus, the scaphoid, the cuboid, and the metatarsal bone of the great toe. AVhen disease is limited to one or two of these bones, excision is usually practicable ; but when the morbid action extends, throug the influence of the connecting articulations, to other bones of the tarsus or metatarsus, partial amputation will probably be required. Primar}’’ disease of the articulations of the foot is a less frequent cause ^ 01 operation than caries of the tarsal bones leading secondarily to an implication of the contiguous articulations ; and the particular operation required will, in a great measure, depend upon the extent of implication of the synovial mem- branes of the foot. When the calcaneo-astragaloid or the calcaneo-cuboid articulations are alone affected, with their contiguous bones, resection of the bones and joints implicated will often be attended by very satisfactory results , but when the large anterior tarsal synovial membrane is in a state of chronic disease, either as the result of primary morbid action set up in it, or secondaiily to diseases of the scaphoid, the cuneiform, or of either of the metatarsal bones connected with it, then resection is scarcely admissible, and Chopart s ampu- tation offers the best means of relief. The inflammation of the large and com- plicated anterior tarsal synovial membrane commonly commences in disease of the scaphoid. It may, usually, readily enough be recognised in its earlier stages by the pain and swelling that take place across the line of articulation between the scaphoid and cuneiform bones, the pain being greatly increased by bending the foot down, and extending across the whole breadth of the foot. For, although it is usually most severe at the inner side, which is the first affected, yet the external section of this complicated articulation, that between the ex- ternal cimeiform and the cuboid, becoming involved, causes suffering to be experienced on the outer side of the foot as weU. In the more advanced stages of this particular disease, the foot assumes a remarkable bulbous or clubbed appearance ; the symmetry of the heel and the outline of the ankle are unim- paired, but the forepart and dorsum of the foot are greatly swollen, glazed, and possibly perforated by sinuses discharging thin unhealthy pus. I look upon this disease of the anterior tarsal synovial membrane as a distinct affection of the foot, requiring to be diagnosed from the other strumous inflammations, and in its advanced stages demanding Chopart’s amputation. It may be stated generally that the result of disease of the tarsus will be mainly dependent upon whether it is acute or chronic, progressive or stationary, diffused or limited. When it is acute, its limit cannot be defined, and after the removal of one portion the morbid action may be lighted up afresh in the structures, osseous or articular, that have been left. When progressive, there will be found to be a general tendency to disease in, or disorganisation of, the tarsal structures, and partial operation can be productive of little good. When it is diffused, extending into the large anterior tarsal or tarso-metatarsal articu- lations, partial operation can a^•ail nothing. In is in those cases in which the disease is chronic, limited, and stationary, or nearly so, that excision and partial operation can be beneficial. Excision of Tarsal Bones.—Any one of the tarsal bones may be the scat of primary disease, which may be limited to the bone originally implicated, or278 KXCI8I0N OF JOINTS AND BONES. lay extend to neighbouring articulations, or through the whole tarsus. There may be looked upon as the most frequent centres of tarsal disease—viz., the Os Calcis, the Astragalus, the Scaphoid, and Cuboid • and tliey are commonly affected in the order given. _ The Os Calcis, from its exposed situation, large size, and spongy structure, IS more frequently the seat of caries and necrosis than any of the other tarsal bones. Very commonly the disease is limited to this bone ; in other instances It extends into the calcaneo-astragaloid or calcaneo-cuboid articulations. When the disease is situated in the imhrior or lateral j)art of the hone, the neighbouring articulations are seldom involved, and then the removal of the morbid structures by gouging ivill usually succeed in effecting a cure. I have frequently had occasion in this way to scoop out great portions, sometimes the whole of the interior of the calcaneum, with the most excellent results. Even when the cuboid is extensively implicated as well, and the calcaiieo-cuboid artic- ulation is the seat of diseased action, the disorganised structures may often be removed by gouging and partial resection, as in the case of which the cut (Fig. 4G5) is a good repre- Fig. 4C5.—Disease of Os Calcis and Cuboid, and of Caltoneo-Cuboid Joint: Lines of Excision. seiitation, where, by means of a _L-shaped incision, these bones were exposed, and them carious portions gouged out. Should, however, the caries have affected the superior or anterior 2wrtions of the hone, then the implication of the astragaloid or cuboid articu- lations may render the excision of the whole bone necessary, as the only means of preventing extension of secondary morbid action to the tarsus generally. So mifrequent, however, is disease of the articular aspects of this bone, that its complete removal is very seldom necessary. Out of at least fifty cases of caries of the os calcis that have been under my care, I have only had occasion to excise the whole bone once ; and Fergusson states that he has never yet foimd it necessary to do this operation. Indeed, excision of the os calcis should not be lightly rmdertaken. The large size of the bone, its importance as a basis of support to the body, and as the point of attachment to the strong muscles of the calf, should induce the Simgeon, whenever practicable, to avoid its complete extirpation, and to limit himself to the application of the gouge, even though he may have to scoop out the whole of the interior of the bone, leaving little more than an osseous shell. This will fill up by the deposit of a dense fibroid tissue, which probably, CA'cntually undergoing partial ossification, leaves the foot as useful as ever for all purposes of support and progression. Operation.—Excision of the os calcis is usually performed by timning a heel- flap back, as in disai-ticulations at the ankle-joint, and then carrying incisions forward into the sole of the foot, by which another flap is turned up, and the calcaneo-cuboid articulation exposed and opened (Fig. 4GG) ; after Avhich the knife is carried between the astragalus and calcaneum, and the latter bone279 EXCISION OF OS CALC IS. cletacliccl. By this operation the sole of the foot is somewhat extensively incised, and cicatrices are left over the heel. In order to avoid this inconvenience, I have found that disarticulation of the os calcis may readily be performed in the following way. The patient lying on his face, a horseshoe incision is carried from a little in front of the calcaneo- cuboid articulation round the heel, along the sides of the foot, to a correspond- ing point on the opposite side. The elliptic flap thus formed is dissected up, the knife being caiTied close to the bone, and the whole under surface of the os calcis thus exposed. A perpendicular incision, about two inches in length, is then made behind the heel, through the tendo Achillis, in the mid-line and into the horizontal one. The tendon is then detached ft-om its insertion and the two lateral flaps are dissected uj), the knife being kept close to the bones, from which the soft parts are well cleared (Fig. 40G). The blade is then carried over the upper and posterior part of the os calcis, the articulation is opened, the interosseous ligaments are divided, and then, by a few touches with the point, the bone is detached fi’om its connections with the cuboid. This bone, together with the astragalus, must then be examined ; and if any disease be met with, the gouge should be applied. Should ankylosis have taken place lietyeen the os calcis and the astragalus, as I have found in one case, the bones28o EXCISION- OF JOINTS AND BONES. may readily be divided by means of Butcher’s saw. By this operation all injiu'y to the sole is avoided ; and the open angle of the wound being the most dependent, a ready outlet is afforded for the discharges. The drawing (Fig. 407) gives an excellent representation of the state of the foot of a girl before and after the excision of a diseased os calcis—a somewhat flattened but most useful foot resulting. Subperiosteal Excision.—Ollier has described a mode of removing the os calcis, in such a way that the periosteum may be preserved so as to allow the regeneration of the bone. A curved incision, commencing on the outside of the tendo Achillis, at the level of the ankle-joint, is earned down as far as the external tuberosity of the os calcis, and thence along the side of the foot as far as the posterior end of the fifth metatarsal bone. The flaps being raised, the periosteum and tendo Achillis are separated from the bone, which is then fiu'ther denuded of its periosteum as far as can be reached: the hgamentous attachments are divided, and the bone is removed. In fact, in caries of the os calcis, it may often be foimd, as in performing Syme’s amputation, that the thickened periosteum strips off the softened and carious bone as readily as the peel off an orange; hence a formal process of dissection is scarcely needed. History and Results.—Excision of the os calcis is a very successful operation. It seems to have been first performed by Monteggia in 1813 ; the result appeared promising, when the patient died of scrofulous disease. The opera- tion then feU into abeyance for twenty-foiu’ years, when Robert, in 1837, in a case of necrosis of the bone, removed the diseased portion, leaving the healthy peripheral layer. The same Surgeon, in 1844, in a case of caries, removed the whole bone with the exception of its upper articular siu’face and the iimer side of the body. Greenhow of Newcastle, in this country, and Rigaud, in France, appear to have been the first Siu’geons who successfully excised the whole of the os calcis. Their cases both occurred in 1848 ; and since that time the operation has been performed in a large number of cases in this country and in America, and established as one of the many important developments made by Conservative Surgery in late years. In France, it seems to have met with little favoiu’, though it has been successfully performed there in several instances by Ollier, Giraldes, and some other Surgeons. Guerin says that the operation should not be attempted : and gives as his only reason for describing the operative procedure, that Enghsh Sm’geons have not feared to undertake it. ' Polaillon, of Paris, in an able article written in 18G9, with the object of advocating the performance of the operation, has collected the records of G4 cases. Of these he sets aside 9, of which he has not been able to find sufficiently accurate statements as to the result. Of the remaining 55,39 veie successful this term implying that the patients were enabled afterwards to valk without artificial apparatus or support. Of the remaining IG, in G, crutches or other apparatus were necessary ; in 7, subsequent amputation was demanded on account of return of the disease or inutility of the foot; and theie weie 3 deaths. Resection of the entire bone—in a few cases with^other portions o the tarsus—appears to have been perfonned in 39 of the 55 cases ; of these, 30 were altogether successful; in 4, artificial support u as necessary, _ require281 EXCISION OF THE ASTRAGALUS. subsequent amputation ; and 3 died. The operation, according to Polaillon, has been more successful in children than in adults. He states that, of 12 cases imder 10 years old, all were successful; between the ages of 10 and 20, there were 14 successful cases, and 3 failures ; between 20 and 30, 7 successes and 0 failm-es ; and between 80 and 40, G successful cases and 3 failures. Repro- duction of the bone occuiTed in 12 cases; 11 being in individuals mider 20 years of age. The Astragalus is situated in a position of great surgical importance. Articulating with the malleolar arch above, with the calcaneum below, and with the scaphoid in front—forming, as it were, the keystone of the foot—it is perfectly evident that any morbid action commencing in it is very likely to spread to and involve all the more important structmes of the foot. Seldom, indeed, does chsease originating in this bone long remain confined to it; and, so far as my experience goes, gouging operations, even if performed at an early period, are rarely of much benefit, the morbid action continuing to extend notwithstanding their employment. Indeed, in diseased astragalus, I believe that excision ought, as a rule, to be practised in preference to gouging, contrary to what is the case in the calcaneum. Disease primarily originating in the astragalus may spread in three direc- tions : upwards into the ankle-joint, downwards to the calcaneum, andforwai’ds to the scaphoid, and thence tlu'ough the large anterior synovial membrane to the rest of the tarsal bones. The treatment will vary according to the direction and extent of the disease. It may be arranged under four heads. 1. hen the astragalus alom is diseased, we find what is seen in the drawing' (Fig. 4G8), which represents the ° to?LTuowr 1 ““y be be unrip • ' four to six inches in length shoidd be made immediately behind the outer malleolus, and carried Wnl n The divTsio?oahc\tte “1 ff*"! Of the external lateral hgameut of the anlde-jouit are then cut282 EXCISION OF JOINTS AND BONES. across ; the tendons of the peronens brevis and tertius, and the extensor brevis digitornm muscle, di\ ided. But the mass of extensor tendons in front of the foot, with the dorsalis pedis artery, must be left untouched. These should be drawn forcibly inwards. The peronens longus tendon may be drawn backwards. The foot is then strongly twisted inwards, the astragalus cleared, and its ligaments divided from the outer side in suceession as they present themselves. When the operation is done for disease of the bone, these structures will usually be more or less softened and disorganised; when for injiuy, they wiU in a great measiwe have been torn through. Hence, in actual operation, the same steps cannot be followed so methodically as may be done on the dead subject. The bone must now be seized with lion-forceps and dra-wn Aveh out of its bed; the knife being applied to any restraining structimes, but being used very carefrdly towards the inner side of the bone, lest the plantar arteries be wounded. Under this process the softened and carious Ijone usually breaks down and has to be taken away piecemeal, or its neck may be cut across, and the head separately removed from its articulation with the scaphoid. If the bone have been dislocated, and its ligamentous con- nections thus torn thi’ough, or if these have been disorganised and softened by disease, it may readily enough be removed as just described. But if the osseous tissue itself be carious and softened, and the ligamentous connections tolerably sound, then the operation becomes extremely troublesome, tedious, and prolonged—the l3one breaking down, and haA'ing to be I’emoA'ed piecemeal by means of the gouge and phers. The result of this operation is very satisfactory ; a good and movable articu- lation may be left betAveen the malleoli and calcaneum, and the limb is but little shortened. According to Hancock, of 109 cases in AA'hich the astragalus was remoA'ed, 76 recovered Avith good and usefol limbs; secondary amputa- tion Avas performed in two, AAuth one death ; 15 others died; and in 14 the results are not knoAni. The operation Avas performed in 64 cases for com- pound dislocation, with 50 complete recoveries ; in 20 of simple dislocation, with 14 complete recoveries; and in 10 for caries, perfect recovery taking place in 6. 2. When the disease has extended from the astragalus to the nialteolai a>ch, excision of the anlcle-joint AAiU be required. This operation may most conve- niently be performed in the folioAving way. A semilunar incision, about foui inches in length, should be made along the outer and inferior aspect of the joint, round the lower border of the external malleolus (Fig. 468), and should be carried sufficiently forwards to give space Avithout dividing the extensoi tendons or the dorsal artery. A perpendiculai- cut should then be made along the back of the fibula. The peroneal tendons need not be dmded, but should be draAvn downwards and backwards ; the lower end of the fibula shou d nex be cut across and detached. The astragalus, which wdl now be exposed, should then be separated from its connections, which, if they be much diseased, maj usually be readily done. If not deeply affected, it aauII be more firmly held and should then be cut across with pliers, and each fragment lifted out 0 bed Avith gouge or pliers.

Fig. 409.—Limb after Excision of the Ankle-joint. Should there be any disease of the articular surfaces of the calcaneimi or scajDhoid, this must be gouged away. The part should then be lightly di'essed, and the limb placed on a Liston’s splint. 3. lATien the disease has extended from the astragalus upicards into the malleolar arch, and downivards into the calcaneum, the line of practice will depend on the extent of the implication of the os calcis. If the gTeater pai’t or the whole of this be involved, no resource is left but amputation—resection not leaving a useful foot. If, however, the calcaneum be only partly involved, its upper surface only being affected, a great deal may be done by conservative siu’gery. The treatment in such cases consists, generally, in removing the astragalus from its bed, and gouging away any diseased bone which may exist either on the upper surface of the calcaneum or on the under surface of the malleolar arch. Very large portions of bone may be removed from this situation. I have taken away the whole of the malleolar arch and astragalus, and gouged out the upper surface of the os calcis very freely; and yet the patient has recovered with a strong and movable foot, but very little shortened or deformed. The accompanying cuts (Fig. 470) are taken from a young man on whom I performed the operation just described. The foot is perfectly useful and strong, and the false joint at the ankle movable. There arc cases, howe'S'er, in which we find that the disease has extended so far beyond its primary seat, that amputation rather than resection is required. But, in the majority of in- stanees, removal of the astragalus and gouging away the upper surfiice of the calcaneum will suffice. The result of excision of the tibio-tarsal articulation is generally good. Spillman says that of 73 cases .'30 were successful. Among these, the outer malleolus was removed iu 22, one of which required secondary amputation, and 4 died. This leaves 51 cases of removal of the tibio-tarsal joint; in 12 of these, the disease was of traumatic origin, and the operation was successfulEXCISION OF JOINTS AND BONES. 284 in 11 ; 111 37 ifc was constitutional, and of these 22 recovered 7 died 7 required secondary amputation, and in one the disease continued two years after the oi^eration. ^ r rij,'. 470.—Excision of Astragalus. 1.

If the disease have extended from the astragalus to the scaplmid, and thence ‘into the anterior range of tarsal joints, the foot will have become so exten- sively disorganised, that partial resection will be of little or no sernce ; and disarticulation at the ankle-joint should be practised. Excision of the Cuboid Bone, either in whole or in part, may be required. Partial excision is here done with the gouge. "Wlien the whole of the bone is taken away, the fifth metatarsal bone with thej little toe will probably also require removal. This may be done by making the fiap, as depicted in Fig. 41, vol. I., only commencing the incision about an inch further back, opposite the calcaneo-cuboid articulation, and opening this instead of the metatarso-cuboid. The Scaphoid Bone is very commonly the seat of primary disease ; and, as this bone is connected in front with the large tarsal synovial membrane, and posteriorly with that which is common to the calcaneo-astragaloid and astragalo-scaphoid articulations, the greater pai’t of the tarsus is apt to become speedily involved in the morbid action. It stands, indeed, next to the astra- galus in its power of implicating a great exteirt of the foot when diseased. TheEXCISION OF TARSAL BONES. 285 „f this implication is such, that excision of the pi-inaarily diseased hone attended by much beneat, and Chopart's ampnta^ tion o/disartiLation at the ankle-joint becomes necessary. _ ^ of the astragalns, I look upon strnmons inflammation and canes of the scapho as most destructive to the integrity of the foot .yenerallv be AVhen the Cuneiform Bones arc the scat of canes, it niU t,enera y found that the middle cuneiform is the bone primarily affecte . ence le disease extends to the lateral ones, or to the bases of the second and third metatarsal bones (Fig. 471). In such cases the anterior tarsal synovial membrane usually becomes extensively implicated, and^ Cho- part’s amputation will be required. But if the morbid action continue to be limited to the middle cuneiform and the contiguous metatarsal bones, and the patient’s general health be good, removal of the diseased osseous structures by the gouge, with extraction of the carious cuneiform, may be attended by successful results. Bxcision of more than one of the Tarsal Bones is sometimes required in chronic disease, and may leave an excellent and useful limb. FTo formal rules for the operation can be laid doATO ; the course of proceeding must depend on the nature of the case and the judgment of the Surgeon. In a lad who was many years since under my care with very extensive and chronic disease of these parts, I removed the lower three inches of the fibula, and gouged away considerable portions of the end of the tibia and of the astragalus, cal- caneum, and cuboid—removing a whole handful of carious .bone ; yet a perfect cure resulted, the patient recovering with a strong and useful foot. The os ealcis and astragalus have been both successfully removed by T. Wakley in 1848, and by Watson of Edinburgh ; and the os calcis, almost the Avhole astragalus, and a part of the scaphoid, by Nicholls of Chelmsford. Mulvany, in a case of disease of the tarsus consequent on compound dislocation, removed the greater part of the scaphoid, half the os calcis, aU the astragalus, and the lower end of the tibia. Fayrer removed the articular ends of the tibia and fibula, the os calcis, astragalus, and scaphoid for disease, in a boy !) years old ; and Lehmann of Polzin, in a case of caries in a man aged 40, removed by subperiosteal excision the entire os calcis, the astragalus, and the scaphoid bones, the foot having a perfectly normal appearance three months after the operation, and the patient being able to walk Avell, without a stick. In infants and very young children, disease of the tarsal articulations and even bones may often be recovered from, without the necessity of having recourse to operation, by attention to the child’s general healtli, and by 2:ivino- the part rest. The Malleoli alone seldom require resection. Should cither of them do so, the operation may readily enough be accomplished, in the outer malleolus, by Fig. 471.- nise.ise of Cuneifoi'iu Bones.EXCISIOX OF JOINTS AND BONES. 286 dividino- the bone with cutting-pliers ; but in the inner malleolus, more care is required in aA'oiding the flexor tendons, the artery, and nerve, and the bone had better be cut across witli a chain-saw. The removal of the outer malleolus or rather of the loAver end of the fibula, is apt to be followed by a tendency to twist of the foot outwards—in fact, to a kind of valgus. The Metatarsal Bones with their Toes occasionally require removal. This is more particularly the case Anth the first and the fifth (p. 77, vol. I.). The middle metatarsal bones cannot advantageously be taken away, leaving merely the first and last; but the two, three, or even the Avhole four of the external metatarsal bones may be resected in early life, and a useful foot left. Aston Key has recorded a case in which, in consequence of injiuy, he ampu- tated the four outer metatarsal bones, the cuboid, and the external and middle cuneiform, leaving merely the line of bones supporting the gTeat toe. The first metatarsal bone was left, supported only by the slender articular seiwice of the internal cuneiform; but it soon got firmer attachments, and a very good foot resulted, by Avhich the patient retained in a gTeat measure his elasticity of tread. The Phalanges and Articulations of the Toes seldom require resection ; as a general rule, their amputation is preferable. The only case Avith which I am acquainted in Avhich resection of the phalanx is required, is when an exostosis has formed under the nail of the toe, pushing it up : here the removal of that portion of bone from Avhich it springs is the best course to pursue. The Great Toe not unfrequently requires removal, in Avhole or in part; but, as it enters largely into the formation of the arch of the foot, no more of it should be taken aAvay than is absolutely necessary. It is especially of impor- tance that the ball of the great toe, if possible, be preserved ; and occasionally this may be effected by excision of the metatarso-phalangcal articulation rather than by the amputation of the member. With regard to the removal of the toe and its metatarsal bone, I must refer to p. 77, vol. I. Whenever it is practicable, the proximal end of the bone should be saved, in order that the insertion of the tendon of the peroneus longus may be preserved. AMPUTATION IN JOINT-DISEASES. In those cases in Avhich excision of the diseased joint is not advisable, in consequence of the acute character of the articular disease, the existence not only of considerable suppuration but of gTeat local and constitutional in’itation, or the peculiar nature of the joint affected, amputation may be the sole resource left to the Surgeon. It is especially in articular disease of the fingei-s and toes, of the tarsus, carpus, ankle, and knee, that this operation is required ; and though it is much less frequently practised uoav than formerly, yet the cases of destructive disease of joints requiring amputation are amongst the most frequent in operatiA-e surgery, and Avill doubtless continue to be so. The Sui’geon, however, must be careful, AA'hilst he avoids continuing to make in- effectual attempts to saA'O the limb at the great hazard of the patient s life, not to amputate until it is clear that all other means have failed ; the patient continuing to lose gTOund so that a further jicrseA’crance in local and constitu- tional treatment Avould probably end in his death, excision not being practic-287 AMPUTATION IN JOINT-DISEASES. able. So Hiv fi’om amputation being an opprobrium to surgery iir such cases as these I look upon it as one of the gi-eatest triumphs of our art, that by a simple and easy operation, rvhich removes the spoiled and useless limb, the life of the patient may be saved, and his health speedily restored. In amputating in cases of chronic joint-disease, where the limb has been the scat of prolonged suppuration, it will be found, just as m cases of many secondary amputations after injuries, that the condition of the muscles of the limb is peculiar. Instead of, as in cases of primary amputation, being dark in colour and retracting forcibly and unequally when cut across, they ivill be found to be pale, soft, flabby, and retracting but little, if at all; lesembling in this respect the muscles in a dead body, with the intermuscular areolai tissue often infiltrated. In consequence of this alteration in their structure and physiological properties, the flaps need not be cut so long in amputation foi chronic suppurative joint-disease as in cases of primary amputation. Circunistances influencing Mortality.—The mortality after amputation for joint-diseases is especially influenced by three conditions : viz., the Seat of the Operation, the Acute or Chronic Character or the Disease, and the Con- stitutional Condition of the Patient. The influence of the seat of operation has already been discussed at p. 53, vol. I. The duration of the disease exercises a most important influence, especially in the larger joints—more particularly the knee. As a general rule, it may be stated that, the more acute the suppurative destruction of a joint, the less successfid is the amputation of the limb hkely to be ; pytemia and low secondary inflammation being especially apt to supervene. (See p. 5G, vol. I.) In very acute cases, the Surgeon ought to evacuate the pus by means of free incisions, and endeavour to delay the necessity of amputation until the active suppurative stage has passed, and the affection has subsided into a chronic form. In chronic cases, the success of amputation is very great. It commonly happens that a patient who has been racked with pain, and been wasting in body for weeks before the local source of irritation was removed, sleeps soundly tho night after the operation, and rapidly gains flesh and strength. In determining upon the adrdsability of resecting a diseased joint or of amputating the limb, the Surgeon must be guided not only by the amount of disease in the articulation, but by the constitutional condition of the patient. In amputation the chief dangers are immediate—from shock, or secondary hoenron-hage. In excision the shock is not so severe, in consequence of the incision being farther from the trunk, and through comparatively superficial and unimportant parts ; no large blood-vessels, nen'es, or even muscles are dir'ided, and there is no danger of secondary harmonhage. But in excision the dangers are chiefly remote ; the suppurative process is long continued, and the discharge of pus abundant; the patient may consequently not have suffi- cient constitutional power to carry him through. So far as erysipelas and pytemia arc concerned, the danger is probably the same in both operations, n addition to this, it must be borne in mind that a patient will often consent to have a joint or bone excised who would not agree to part with a liml). As phthisis not unfrcqrrontly co-exists with the advanced forms of strumous288 EXCISION OF JOINTS AND BONES. joints, the question of amputation under these circumstances becomes one of ■s’ery considerable importance. If the phthisis be rapidly progressing, and there be a strong hereditary tendency to the disease, or if it have advanced to softening of the lung and the formation of vomica, it will be useless to operate. If, however, the phthisis be but slight and incipient, and be apparently due to the local irritation of and discharge from the diseased joint, to the confinement to bed that this necessitates, and to the general deprivation of health that ensues, amputation may not only be safely but advantageously practised ; and I have performed it in many such cases to the manifest advantage of the patient.289 SPIXA BIFIDA. CHAPTER L. ♦ DISEASES OF THE SPINE. SPINA BIFIDA. It occasionally happens that, from congenital malformation and arrest of development, the spinous processes of some of the yertebrse are deficient, and their laminfe either absent or separated ; in consequence of which the meninges of the spinal cord are unprotected, and project through the aperture in the bones, giving rise to a tumour at the part where the arrest of development in the osseous structm*es occurs. Characters.—The tumour is usually oval, its long axis corresponding with that of the spine. It generally varies in size, fi’om that of a walnut to an orange ; but occasionally it attains an immense bulk, equal to that of a child’s head. In some cases the tumour is lobulated, having an imperfect septum stretching across it; in other instances, two or more of these tumours have been met wdth in the spine. The skin covering it is usually of its normal colour ; but when the tumoiu’ is of considerable size, it may be thin and have a bluish or congested appearance, and present a certain degree of transparency. In these circumstances, ulceration from distension and thinning of the skin may eventually take place. On examining the tumour, which is hard, though elastic when the child is held upright, it will be found that it becomes soft when the child is laid horizontally. It sometimes becomes tense dm’ing expiration, and softer during inspiration. In some cases fluctuation is perceptible, and by pressure the bulk may be lessened. Spina bifida may be met with in any part of the vertebral column ; it is, however, almost invariably found in the lumbar region, the cases in which it appears higher up being of rare occurrence ; instances of the kind are, however, mentioned by Cruveilhier. When it occurs higher up, in the cervical or upper dorsal region, it has been found that the spinal cord and nerves are usually adherent to the walls of the tumoiu’; in the lumbar region this is not the case. The tumour is distended by the cerebro-spinal fluid, which is characterised by its clear limpid appearance, by its low specific gravity (1003 to lOOG being the average), and by its containing merely a trace of albumen, a considerable quantity of chloride of sodium, and a trace of sugar. Prohnosis.—The prognosis of spina bifida will depend upon the size of the tumour, on the condition of the skin covering it, and on its situation. If it bo of small size, with healthy integumental investment, and without a tendency Vr»T TT ^^9° DISEASES OF THE SPINE. to increase, the patient may live to an adult a<?e, provided care be taken to protect the tumour. If of largo size, it is generally fatal, the child usually dying at an early age of convulsions. In other instances the tumour increases in size, the skin covering it becomes thin and rod, ulcerates, and gives way, and deatlx results from spinal meningitis. Upon the whole, it may bo stated as a general lule, that spina bifida is more dangerous the higher it is placed on the spine. Treatment. In the treatment of spina bifida, the line of practice mxxst be de- termined by the size of the tumour and by the condition of the skin covering it. When the tumour is veiy large, and the skin covering it has become reddened, showing a tendency to give way, tapping and compression combined offer the only chance of safety. The case fr’om which the accompanying drawing is taken was cured in this way. It was that of a yoixng girl. At birth the tumour protruding through the spina bifida was small, but it gradually increased in size, until at the age of thirteen it had attained the following dimensions : — Circmnference at base 25 inches ; length over greatest convexity 19 inches ; breadth llj inches. The tumour occupied the lumbo- sacral region, and stretched over both gluteal regions. It was tense and translucent; the skin reddened, very thin, and becoming darkly congested at the more prominent part, evidently in imminent danger of bursting. Health excellent; development good. I tapped the tumour and drew off 101 ounces of cerebro-spiual fluid. When emptied, an aperture 1|- inch long and three-quarters of an inch broad, could be felt at the lower lumbar and upper sacral regions to the left of the mesial line. The parts were well padded xHth cotton wool and supported by an elastic bandage. No ill effects followed the tapping. This was repeated nine times in eighteen weeks, 985 ounces in aU of clear cei’ebro-sixinal fluid being drawn off; the largest tapping amounted to 120 ounces ; the smallest to 93. After each tapping, methodical comiDression was employed. The ninth tapping xvas followed by signs of irritation in the lining membrane of the tumom*, xvhich became greatly thickened, evidently by plastic deposits. Slight spinal meningitis with a tendency to opisthotonos and convulsive movements came on, but passed off. The sac did not refiU; and, the skin covering it being thickened and corrugated, the patient soon completely recovered, and is now—four years after the last operation—strong, healthy, and actix'e. Cabral of Lisbon operated successfully by tapping and pressure in a case of spina bifida on a child a month old. In cases in which the child is otherwise healthy and strong, the tumour small, with sound skin covering it, and in which little pain or inconvenience arises from pressure on it, means may be adopted for reliex'ing or possibly even cuilng the deformity. In these circumstances, bcai’ing in mind that the disease is not necessarily fatal, we shall probably best consult the welfare of the child liy abstaining Eig. 472.—Large Si>ina Bifida, cured by tapping and x)re.ssure.291 ANGULAli CURVATURE OF SPINE. from all operative interference, and merely protecting the tumour with a piece of leather or a layer of cotton-wool. If it be thought desirable to attempt a cure, the simplest mode is to employ pressure on the tumour, by means of a compress and bandage ; or, what is better, an air-pad, similar to those used for umbilical hernia, and kept in place by an India-iubbei band. In addition to pressure exercised in this way, the recommendation of Sir A. Cooper may be followed, and the tumour punctured from time to time vdth a small trochar ; care being taken, however, to prevent the ulceration of the punctures, by covering them mth coUodion. In this way, by the combination of puncture and compression, cases have been cured. Gradually applied lateral compression has been successful in a few cases. Thus Wilson removed the tumour by the gradual pressure of a clamp applied to its base, and keeping the parts in close apposition by means of this instrument, so as to prevent the entrance of air, and the consequent occuiTence of spinal menin- gitis. In this case the tumour was as large as an orange, and not pedunculated. If it have a naiTow base, the prospect of ciu’e by this means vill be better. Beynard and Latil applied compression successfully by means of threads passed through quills or small wooden tubes, and gradually tightened. All other- plans of treatment, by which the tumour is opened, and the air allowed to enter it, are fraught with danger, and will, I believe, be inevitably followed by the death of the child, from inflammation of the meninges of the cord, and con- vulsions. In fact, as a general rule, operations for the removal of the tumour- are to be condemned. I have never knowrr arry but a fatal issue follow its removal by the ligature, scissors, or the knife. ANGULAR CURVATURE OP THE SPINE. POTT’S DISEASE. This disease, which consists, in its full development, of destruction of the bodies of the vertebriB, with disintegration of the intervertebral fibro-cartilao-e, m.ost commonly ocem-s in young childr-err, sometimes but a few rrrorrths old ; but it is not unfi-equerrtly met with at all ages up to thirty. It is always, I believe, a scrofulous affection, consistmg essentially in degeneration of the fibro-cartilagcs of the spine, or in strumous ostitis ; sometimes, but far more rarely, in tubercular infiltration of the bodies of one of the vertebrar, followed, as commonly happens in this condition, by congestion, caries, or necrosis of the osseous tissue that is in contact with, or is the seat of, the deposit. When we consider the complicated structure, and the variety and extent of the movements of the spinal colimm, we cannot but be surprised that its organic diseases arc so comparatively rare. The quantity of osseous tissue that enters into its formation—a lai-ge portion of which is cancellous, and hence peculiarly prone to caries—whether simple or tuberculous—would mark it as a part that ought to be peculiarly liable to these pathological changes. The vanety and extent of its ligamentous structure, of its fibro-cartilagcs, the articu- lations between the individual vertebne, and between them and the ribs all give t le necessary elements for chronic disease, which might be considered of proliably frequent occun-once when Ave reflect on the extent, varietv and frequency of its movements. But so admirably is the column as a whole fr-equently the scat of organic disease than might a priori be supposed to be possible.292 mSEASES OF THE SPINE. Changes in the Spinal Column.—Ang'ular curvature of the spine, or “ Pott’s disease,” as it is familiarly called, may originate in disease of two different structures of the spinal column ; viz., 1, the intervertebral fibro- cartilages ; 2, the bodies of the vertebrm. The seat of origin exereises an important inflnence on the character and progress of the disease. When it commences in the intervertebral fibro-cartilage, it is seldom fatal, the disease consisting in a strumous and inflammatory softening of these structures, going on to their absoi-ption and the consequent falhng together and fusion by bony ankylosis of the bodies of the vertebra:. In these cases, abscess seldom or never occurs, and the angular projection is usually limited to three vertebral spines at most. AATien the disease occurs in the bones of the spinal column, it primarily originates in and is usually confined throughout to the cancellous structure of the bodies of the vertebrm, leaving the spines, the arches, and the articular processes, unaffected ; but in some instances even those structures become implicated. The disease may begin in two distinct ways : 1, by the develop- ment of ordinary strumous osteitis : 2, by the deposit of tubercle in the can- cellous structure of the bone. The tubercle so deposited excites inflammation, and leads to disintegration of the suiTounding osseous structiue. The disease. whether simple strumous osteitis or tuberculous caries from its commencement, attacks the bodies of the vertebrm, which are cancellous, in preference to the other parts of these bones which are composed of compact osseous stiucturc. The bodies of the affected vertebrae become thin, eroded, and p-adually hollowed out anteriorly. In this way the bodies of fi’om three to six or eight of the vertebi’cB may be destroyed ; the corresponding intern ertebral fibro-caitilagcs.

These changes commonly occur about the middle dorsal vertebivT-; if extensive, they may implicate the upper or lower doi-sal, or upper lumbai-, and give rise to angular projection backwards of the diseased pai-t of the spine, coiTcsponding in extent to the amount of destruc- tion of the vertebrie (Figs. 473 and 474). The mechanism of this excurvation, which is usually the most marked feature in this disease, is easily understood by reference to the pathology of the afiection. The bodies (one or more) of the vertebrie, being thinned and weakened, at last give way mider the pressure of the weight of the upper part of the body ; and, the remains of the disin- tegi-ated bodies being fused together, the upper part bends over, and the spines project posteriorly. The degree of bending forwards and of posterior excur\ a- tion cori'esponds to the amount of the destruction of the bodies of the vertebrie. At the same time that the upper part bends forwards, the lower part of the spine rarely maintains the exact position as it did in Fig. 473. In the great majority of cases there is a compensating incimvation just below the exciuTated vertebrie. In this Avay the upper part of the body is carried erect. The size of the angle of excurvation varies according to the number of the absorbed vertebral bodies and the extent of their disintegration. When one only is diseased it is acute; when several, more obtuse or open. When one vertebra only or chiefly is diseased, three spinous processes will project to form the angle, that of the diseased A'ertebra being the apex. If two or three be diseased, flve spinous processes usually enter into the formation of the angle of exciu’vation, and then the Avhole of this portion of the column will be displaced backAvards, giving a thickened and broadened base to the excurva- tion in the lateral direction. It is seldom that the spinal cord becomes com- pressed, injured, or diseased dining the lArogress of this disease. In some cases, however, more especially in adults, and in those cases in which the posterior excin-Antion is shght, the spine maintaining its erect position, spinal meningitis may be developed. This is owing to the spinal canal being opened in consequence of the salutary and conservative process of angular ankylosis not having been sufficiently developed. Short of this, a certain amount of pai-aplegia may be produced from partial compression of the cord. Effusion into the sheath of the cord then takes place, and, the cord itself becoming softened opposite the seat of cinA'ature, paraplegia Avill be occasioned. In some cases the bodies of the vertebrie, instead of being carious, are simply eioded, or scooped out, leaA’ing a hard, dry, and somewhat rough osseous surface, Avhich has evidently been the seat of chronic osteitis. These cases are quite incurable ; no process of repair taking place. Symptoms.—ibigular cuiwatine, or Pott’s disease of the spine, commonly begins, especially in childi-en, in a very insidious manner. It usually occurs m strumous children, and is generally referred to a fall or blow on the baek Ihe first symptom that most often attracts attention is the child’s attitude* which IS altered and very characteristie. The body is held stiffly straight and upright; it IS neither bent nor turned to one side Avhen the child moves, but tfie spme IS moved as a whole and in a rigidly fixed manner. The shoulders are raised, the chin is throum up, and the toes are slightly turned in. The child Avalks Avith great caution, and very stiffly.“94 DISEASES OF THE SPINE. 0}ie of the earliest symptoms complained of is often an iU-defined superficial pain, extending round the trunk, more severe, perhaps, on one side than on the other, and occasionally referred to the stomach. After a time the child becomes unable to stand upright, has a tendency to lean the body forwards, or to support it by resting the hands on the knees, or by seizing hold of anything Fig. 475.—Natural Cun'e of Spino.

It will also be found that the patient experiences great difficulty in raising himself without assistance from the hori- zontal into the sitting position, or in turning himself sideways in bed without the use of his arms. On examination, one or two of the spines about the middle of the back will be found to be a little more prominent than the rest; and, on pressing or tapjring upon them, pain will be complained of. The child usually becomes stimted in its growth ; and, if the disease be not an-ested by proper treatment, the patient continues more or less hump- or round-backed for life. In other cases the disease will run on to the formation of abscess, as Avill immediately be described, strumous manifestations occurring elsewhere, and death eventually resulting. In adults, the danger and the symptoms will vary greatly according to the seat of the affection. It is most dangerous, and rapidly fatal, when the cervical vertebrm are implicated ; for, as the bodies of these are shallow, caries readily penetrates to the spinal canal, and the cord or its membranes may thus be irri- tated. AVhen the dorsal or lumbar vertebrm become diseased, the affection is not so immediately serious to the life, as it may be to the figure of the patient. In adults it often commences with flying obseme pain in the loins or back, apparently of a rheumatic character, shooting round the body or down the thighs. On examining the sj)ine, which feels weak to the patient, and Avhich, as in the child, is incapable of supporting him or of enabling him to raise or tiuTi himself without assistance, tenderness on pressure or on tapping will be experienced at one point, and he will wince when a sponge Anmiig out of hotABSCESS IiV DISEASE OF SPINE. 295 Fig. 478.—Attitude of Uliild in Angular (Jun'ature in Ad- vanced Stage. water is applied to this pai-t; although there may be no appearance of excurva- tion, yet the skin covering it is hyperaisthetic. In these cases of caries 'mthout angular curvature, it will be found that the spine has lost its natural free mobility and flexibility, moving flxedly, stiffly, and as a whole, when the patient leans forwards or sideways. The patient, when laid flat on his back, cannot raise himself into a sitting position without the aid of his hands or elbows, and he cannot turn shai-ply and suddenly over upon his face. Occasionally the incipient curvature, when it occurs, assumes more of a lateral than of an angular direction ; and in one fatal case I have seen the spine actually bent back- Avards, so as to be incurA’ated at the seat of disease. In some rare cases, the true angular exciirvation dependent on caries of the bodies of the vertebrae may be associated lAith the ordinary lateral ciu've of debility. The lower limbs now become iveak, and the patient v^alks with a peculiar shuffling tottering gait, the legs being outspread, and the feet turned out. The Aveakness of the limbs is especially marked in going upstairs, and may be tested by directing the patient to stand unsupported on one leg, and raise the other so as to place the foot upon the seat of a chair, which he wiU probably be unable to do. Not mifrequently there is more or less of a neuralgic affection associated Avuth the muscular Aveakness—a species of neiu’algic motor paralysis which is very characteristic. Sensation is not only perfect, but over-acute in parts, Avhilst there is an ataxic state of the muscles of the lower extremities which presents a peculiar and characteristic train of nervous phenomena. The deformity of the spine may sloAvly in- crease ; the patient may become unable to stand ; and spasms of the muscles of the loAver extremity may come on together Avith a tendency to relaxation of the sphincter ani, and retention of urine. Abscess noAV commonly makes its appearance ; and in some cases it occurs before any of the other signs except pain and weakness of the spine, but cer- tainly before any deformity has taken place. When the abscess forms, as Stanley has observed, the pain and irritation of the spinal cord and nerves are usually lessened for a time. It must not, hoAvever, be supposed that abscess necessarily forms in all cases. In children Ave often meet Avith gi'eat excurvation Avithout any abscess. In adults, however, it is very rare to see angular ciu’vature Avithout suppuration. l>ut the liability to abscess Avill depend not only on the age of the patient, but on the primary seat of the disease, Avhether it commence in the intervertebral Ino-cartilages or in the bones of the spine ; and, if in the vertebras, on its 01 igin, Avhether tuberculous or not. If the disease commence in the interver- tebial structures, consolidation of the diseased spine Avill often take place Avit out the foniAation of abscess. But AA'hen it is situated primarily in the vertebne, this is much more doubtful; here, hoAvever, much Avill depend on the onn of the disease. Simple congestive or inflammatory caries of the spine may take place to a veiy considerable extent, and yet no suijpuration occur ; t le sodics ol the vertebrae undei-going erosion and absorption, and coalescing296 DISEASES OF THE SPINE. so as to become fused together iu one soft and fi-iable mass of bone, across which bridges of osseous tissue are sometimes thrown out, so as to strengthen the otherwise weakened sihne. In these cases, masses of porcellaneous deposit will not nnfrequently be found intermixed with and adherent to the carious bone. Indeed, this ankylosis and fusion of the bodies of the diseased vertebra} may be looked upon as the natural mode of cure of angular curvatm’e of the spine ; the only way in which it can take place when once the disease has advanced to any considerable extent. When abscess forms in connection with diseased spine, it is in most cases the result of the continued irritation produced by the tuberculous osteitis ; and it may become the most prominent and marked featirre of the affection, giving rise almost to a distinct and independent disease. The situation and coiu’se of the abscess depend mainly upon the part of the spine affected ; thus, for instance, when the cervical vertebrte are diseased, the abscess may come for- wards behind the pharynx, and may occasionally extend under the sterno- mastoid muscle to the side of the neck, where it opens ; sometimes, though very rarely, it passes into the chest, and in other cases down into the axilla. When the disease is seated in the dorsal vertebrae, it usually passes forwards under the piUars of the diaphragm, down the side of the aorta and the iliac vessels, into the ihac fossa, and then presents through the alrdominal wall above Poupart’s ligament; sometimes, if the patient be long kept in the recumbent position, the pus sinks into the pelvis, and then passes out through the sacro- sciatic notch, giving rises to a large accumulation in the gluteal region, or it may present by the side of the anus. In other instances, again, the pus passes directly backwards, and large dorsal or lunxbar abscesses are the result. It is remarkable that in these cases of caries of the dorsal vertebras the pus does not tend to encroach on the chest or the pleimal cavity. In other cases, when the lower dorsal or upper lumbar vertebra are diseased, the pus enters the sheath of the psoas muscle, thus constituting the common affection termed Psoas Aiscess, and, passing along this, under Poupart’s ligament, presents in the thigh ; or it may continue its course downwards, burroAving under the muscles of this region, until it i*eaches the popliteal space, and may even pass from this some distance downwards on to the calf or ankle. I have seen an abscess, which took its origin in disease of the dorsal Am’tebrfe, opened by the side of the tendo AchiUis (Fig. 74, Vol. I.). In other cases, again, these abscesses take a different course ; and, descending into the subperitoneal areolar tissue of the pelvis, may present by the side of the rectum in the periiifeum, or pass out of the sciatic notch, and down by the side of the trochanter. The Cjuantity of pus contained in these collections is sometimes enormous, and abscesses of this description attain a greater magnitude than those of any other part of the body. In some cases the abscess may follow the ^course of both psoas muscles, and project on each groin at the same time. Their true nature and point of origin may usually be determined by an examination of the spine, and by feeling an impulse on coughing communicated to their extremest points of presentation. Sometimes fragments of the carious or necrosed bone from bodies of the diseased vertebra will be found in the pus more particularly towards the termination of the case, nhen ieco\eiy y ankylosis is taking jilace. In the patient from whom big. 4b0 (p. 300) uasDIAGNOSIS OF CARIES OF THE SPINE. 297 taken, several fragments of bone thus came away in an abscess that opened m the fore part of the thigh. _ _ , i i. Di vgxosis.—The diagnosis of caries of the spine is made at the hrst sight of a patient 'affected by the disease, when once the angular deformity has taken place. It is, however, difficult before excurvation occurs, being only indicated at this period by the existence of pain in the back, and by some symptoms of spinal irritation. At this stage it may be mistaken for sinnal or intercostal neundgia, for rheumatism, or for chronic nephritis. The persistence, however, of a continuous fixed pain in the back should always lead to a suspi- cion as to the true nature of the disease, lest the gxievous error be committed of treating as mere neuralgia or rheumatism what may tmm out to be incui- able diseas°e of the spine itself. Here the tenderness on pressime, the increased sensibility to the application of heat will determine the seat of the^ affection. The pain elicited by rotation or by antero-posterior movement is a very valuable symptom. In most cases pain on bending backwards is most com- jilained of. The patient can stoop forwards, but if bent backwards suffers much. So also pressm’e on the head or shoulders greatly increases the pain or the part affected. The shape of the back also, as also there is loss of the natural and graceful ciu’ves of the spine with a tendency, though it be very slight, to projection of some of the spines, the feeling of weakness in the back, the difficulty iu rising from a sitting or horizontal position, in turning, or in standing on one leg unaided, the loss of the natm’al flexibility of the spine, and especially the occmTence of these symptoms in early childhood or youth, at a period when the other diseases rarely occiu', and are still less rarely persistent, would lead one to suspect the true nature of the affection. The diagnosis between abscesses localised in the situations mentioned and those arising from diseased spine, is not always easy ; as purulent collections of various kinds may form in the different planes of areolar tissue in the neigh- bourhood of the vertebral column, without any disease existing in it. Thus, a large psoas abscess descending in the sheath of the muscle and presenting under Poupart’s ligament, may occm* fr’om some disease or irritation of the areolar or fascial structirres without any disease of the vertebrae themselves. In these cases of simple abscess, the diagnosis from psoas abscess dependent upon verte- bral disease is usually easy, as there will be an absence of all excm’vation of the spine or even of tenderness along it. As psoas abscess dependent upon verte- bral caries almost invariably presents in the groin, and a large abscess in the groin may arise fr’om various other conditions, independently of such vertebral disease, the Hurgeon must attend carefully to the diagnosis of these various conditions. Abscess in the groin may arise from the following causes :—1, from large lymphatic collections in the subcutaneous or intermuscular planes of areolar tissue ; 2, from disease of the areolar tissue around the kidneys ; 3, from peiicaecal abscess (on the right side only) ; 4, fr’om iliac abscess, Avhcther form- ing merely in the iliac fascia, or dependent on disease of the peh'ic bones ; o, from hip-joint disease, the abscess being pelvic ; G, from large buboes or glan- dular abscesses ; 7, from an empyema perforating the pleura and finding its nay down behind the diaphragm ; and 8, from serous or hydatid cysts. These various collections may, howmver, with a little caution be readily distinguished from the ordinaiy form of spinal abscess that descends along the psoas "muscle.DISEASES OF THE SPINE. 298 In tlie first place, in all these cases there is an absence of that dorsal pain and tenderness, with more or less excnrration, which, though not invariably present, is commonly met with in psoas abscess. Then, again, if the collection be perinephriUc, there will have been previous, or there are co-existing symptoms of renal disease. If it occur in the areolar tissue around the ccmm, the pus will be peculiarly offensive, will present itself in a less distinct manner, and will probably be associated with symptoms of intestinal irritation. I have seen the pus in a pcricmcal abscess pass under Poupart’s ligament, and present as a large sloughy abscess at the upper and outer part of the thigh. In those rare cases in which an empyema has found its way between the layers of the abdo- minal muscles, and presented in the gi’oin, the stethoscopic signs will point out the nature of the affection. In abscess connected ivith disease of the hip-joint, there "will be special e\idences of the source of the pus. The only real difficulty consists in diagnosing large psoas abscess presenting in the thigh or in other parts of the lower extremity, and dependent on disease of the vertebral column, fi'om iliac abscess taking its origin in the loose areolar tissue of the ihac fossa, whether it be coimected or not with disease of the coiresponding bone ; and in these cases the difficulty is often not a little increased in consequence of the ihac abscess finding its way into the sheath of the psoas muscle. In iliac abscess, the disease usually commences at or after the middle period of fife, always in adults ; and, as Stanley has observed, usually presents itself externally immediately abo'\’e Poupart’s ligament, being conducted forwards to this situation by the iliac fascia. Psoas abscess, on the contrary, most com- monly occurs in the earlier periods of life ; and extends down into the thigh along the coiu’se of the psoas muscle, so that it always presents below Poupart’s ligament. It is also commonly associated with some indication of irritation of the muscle in the sheath of which it is situated ; thus, there is an inabiUty to stand upright, to extend the leg, and pain is complained of in walking. Psoas abscess also, in many cases, occurs suddenly, the patient finding, on washing himself in the morning, that he has a large soft tumour in the upper part ot the groin ; whereas iliac abscess comes on more gradually, and presents in a more diffused and less circumscribed manner. Iliac and psoas abscesses also require to be diagnosed fi’om certain forms of aneurism of the abdominal aorta or iliac arteries; which, having become diffused by the rupture of their sac, have formed large non-pulsating extra's'asations in the sheath of the psoas in the iliac fossa. In such cases the previous history, the absence of distinct fluctuation, and possibly stethoscopic examination, together with the sudden appearance of the tumoin, will thi’ow light on the true nature of the case. In other cases, again, when the abscess, after deeply burrowing, has per- forated the fascia lata, its feel closely resembles that of certain fatty tumours. Here the possibility of diminishing the size of the swelling on pressure, and impulse on coughing, enable the Surgeon to effect the diagnosis. From femoral hernia the soft and fluctuating character of the swelling, its gradual retmn when pressure is taken off, its situation external to^ or below the femoral vessels, and all absence of gurgling, constitute the chief distin- guishing charactera. _ .

PnoGXOSis.—The prognosis is necessarily unfavourable, ^ It has two aspects: 1, As to the persistence of Deformity ; 2, As to the Life ot the patient. ’ 1. Deformity.—So fill- as the defonnity from angular curvatm-e of the spine is concerned, it may be pronounced to be incurable. The diseased spine is soldered and held together by the fusion of the softened and disintegrated in- tcn-ertebral structures and vertebral bodies ; and any attempt at straightening or at unfolding this exemwation would be attended by the gveatest risk, from danger of exciting irritation of the spinal meninges, or opening the spinal canS. When exciirvation has taken place, there has been loss of substance ; and this cannot be repaired. Hence the spine must remain shortened in front and bent out posteriorly. 2. Life.—So far as life is concemed, the prognosis will mainly depend on several conditions. The first is the extent of the caries: if several vertebrm be affected, so that the emwe is veiy long, the disease is necessarily liighly dan- gerousfrom the extent of osseous structure implicated. It was long ago remarked by Boyer, that the most fatal cases were generally those in which the spine preserved its straight position ; whereas, when it was much curved, death seldom residted. The truth of this remark I have had frequent occasion to verify ; and the circumstance would appear to be owing to the fact that, when the spine continues straight at the same time that the bodies of the vertebrm are tuberculous and carious, ankylosis cannot occin, so that the spinal canal is open and the cord hvitated ; whereas, when they have fallen together and very considerable gibbosity has resulted, ankylosis more readily takes place, and thus an imperfect cine is effected. The size of the abscesses, and the amount of discharge from them, must also necessarily seriously influence the result. If they be very large, and continuously discharging, hectic and consequent death will probably supervene, Treatmext.—In infants, the utmost that can be done is to direct that they be laid prone upon a pillow or small couch constructed for the purpose ; that the general health be improved by tonics suited to their age : that they have the advantage of coimtry or sea air ; and that some counter-irritant, as the tincture of iodine, be applied by the side of the spine. In children that are somewhat oldei’, and in adults, great ad^'antage may be derived by strictly for- bidding them to walk, stand, or sit erect; confining them rigidly to the prone couch, and adopting a general plan of tonic treatment. In fact, the principles of treatment are extremely simple : the improvement of the general health by good diet, tonics, and sea-air, in order to remove the strumous condition with which this disease is ahvays associated. AVith regard to the value of active pyogenic counter-irritation, by means of issues or the actual cautery, much dis- crepancy of opinion exists. I cannot but think that these means are employed far too indiscriminately, and often in cases in wdiich more harm than good results from their use. The rule for their employment appears to me to be this that in the earliest stages of caries of the spine, and before the formation of abscess, they are of considerable service, possibly in aiTestiug the progress of the disease in the osseous structures, and certainly in relieving pain and remov-DISEASES OF THE SPINE. 300 ing- irritation of the cord and spinal nerves ; but that, after abscess has formed, and IS presenting either in the lower iliac fossa or in the thigh, they are not only useless in arresting mischief or inducing repair, but injurious by weaken- ing, and being a source of additional irritation to, the patient. Eest in the horizontal position is the most important element in the treatment; if the patient be allowed to stand upright or to sit, the weight of the head and slioulders will tend to ciu’ve forward the weakened spine, and by their pressure increase the already existing irritation in it. The horizontal position relieves the diseased parts ol this additional source of distress. In these cases the prone position is preferable to the supine, and the patient, if old enough, should always be laid upon a properly constructed prone couch. The prone posi- tion is certainly the best; for not only is the projecting angle formed by the exciuwated spine not injm-iously compressed, as it would be in the supine or lateral position, but the patient is more comfortable ; and it is far easier to make the necessary application in the way of issues and moxte than could other- wise be done. At the same time, the back not being the lowest part of the body, there is a less tendency to conges- tion of the spinal veins, and to consequent increase of the inflammatoiy softening of the bones. When the disease has in this way been arrested, for Avhich many months—at least twelve or eighteen—will be required, the patient may be allowed to get up azid move about, by wearing proper ap- paratus so as to support the trunk. This may be constructed on the plan shown in the accompanying figiu’e (Fig. 179). It combines three jn’inciples in its action—1, a broad pehic band, making a firm basis of support round the lower part of the trunk ; 2, lateral upright stems, terminating in crutches, by Avhich the weight of the head and shoulders is taken off the diseased spine, and transmitted directly to the pelvic base ; and 3, a posterior plate, which by means of a rachet can be brought to bear directly upon the excurvated part of the spme, and support, and in some degree rectify, the position of this. Taylor’s support (Fig. 480) is also an a|)paratus of great utihty, more especially in the advanced stages of angular curvature of the spine, where ankylosis has taken place between the diseased vertebrze. It has a tendency, in consequence of the upright iron dorsal rods being jointed backwards, to uplift the head and shoulders, and thus often improves considerably the attitude of the patient. But this very advantage in the later stages becomes a source of inconvenience if not of positive danger in the earlier periods of the disease, as it tends to separate the vertebrae in process of consohdation. It is of considerable im- Fig. 470.—Apiiamtiis for Su]i- portuiK till! Trunk in Vertebral Caries.

AVhen abscess has fomied, the Surgeon should be in no_ huny to open it; but, in accordance with the principles laid down when treating of this affection, he should delay doing so, lest injiu-ious fatal constitutional iiTitation be set up. AVhen it becomes necessary, from the approach of the matter to^ the surface, to give exit to it, this should be done by aspiration or valvular incision, closed, as soon as the pus has been discharged, by means of hare-lip pins, or in the way described on p. 152, A^ol. I., or by the “antiseptic method” (p. 154, Vol. L). The hectic or constitutional imtation that supervenes about this period, must of course be treated on general principles. DISEASE OP THE CERVICAI, SPINE. AVe have hitherto considered caries as affecting the dorsal and lumbar spine. But the same disease may be developed, though much less frequently, in the cervical region. The reason of its gi’cater rarity here arises, I believe, from the comparative absence of cancellous structure in the ceiwical vertebrm, and hence the less tendency to strumous or tuberculous osteitis, the disease probably commencing rather in the ligamentous than in the osseous structures. The signs are the usual ones of pain, rigidity, swelling, diffused and ill- defined. But there is in the cendcal region no tendency to angular incurva- tions. This is owing to the shallowness of the bodies of the vertebrm not admitting that coalescence after their destruction, which is characteristic of the same disease in the dorsal and Inmbo-dorsal regiojis. But the patient is unable to support or to ton his head ; he holds it in his hands when in the upright position, and rotates the whole body when he attempts to look round. There vill be pain on any attempt at movement, whether rotatory or antero- posterior, and on pressure on the vertex. Although no angular curvation can, for the reason just stated, take place in this region, the spinous processes may become irregular, one or two projecting more than the other. Disease of the Atlas and Axis, and between the Atlas and Occiput, constitutes one of the most serious forms of vertebral caries. In these cases- there are pain and swelling, with great difficulty or absolute inability in moving* the head ; after a time indication of the areolar tissue, with swelling and fluctuation behind the pharynx, come on, pushmg forwards its posterior wall against the nasal apertures, causing the tongue to be extruded, occasioning* much difficulty and distress in breathing, and giving rise to a peculiar nasal tone in the voice. The formation of this rctro-phar}*ngeal abscess in young* people should always lead to an examination of the cervical spine. The abscess- uiay point here, or may extend outwardly under the muscles of the neck. Patients affected by this disease truly present a remarkable as well as distressing* appearance. The sterno-mastoid muscles are remarkably tense and prominent, and, the neck being perfectly rigid, they are unable to turn the head, but when they Avant to look round have to twist their whole liody; at the same time, the weakness in the neck usually compels them to support the head with both hands, putting one under the chin, the other under the occiput, and so holdingDISEASES OF THE SPINE. 302 it. The disease may suddenly terminate fatally by luxation of the vertebra) forwards, compression of the cord, and sudden asphyxia; or more slowly by hectic and gradual interference with the respiratory functions. The Treatment innst be conducted on precisely the same principles as that of angular curvatiu’e, by absolute rest, coimter-iiTitation, in the early stage, and tonics. As great and immediate danger may result from the sudden displacement of the vertebim, and the consecpient compression of the cciwical cord, the head usually requires to be steadied by proper apparatus calculated to support it and limit its movements, such as is represented in Fig. 25-1, ■s'ol. I., and the patient should be confined to the recumbent position. The paraplegia that accompanies severe forms of enenrvature of the spine AviU vary in degTee from impairment of motor power in the feet and legs to complete abolition of all sensation and motion in the loAver extremities. The feet, legs, and thighs will be utterly insensible to the electric stimulus both as regards muscular initability and cutaneous sensibility. But however marked the paraplegia, recovery need not be despaired of, provided the sphincters be not affected. I have seen cases of paraplegia from spinal caries, in which the electric sensibility and irritability were completely destroyed, and had been so for a year or two, recover both as to sensation and motion as the activity of the spinal mischief subsided under the influence of rest and appropriate treatment.DISEASE OF THE SACRO-ILIAO JOINT. 303 CHAPTER LI. 4 DISEASE OF THE SACRO-ILTAC JOINT. Disease of the Sacro-Iliac Articulation is a rare affection. With but few exceptions, systematic writers on Surgery are altogether silent npon this subject. Boyer and Chelius mention the disease ; but it is only by N^laton that any detailed description of it has been given. This may be partly accounted for by its rarity, and partly, perhaps, by its haring not nnfrequently been confounded with some of the varieties of coxalgia or of spinal disease. The sacro-iliac disease is essentially a very chronic affection, lasting for months or years. It appears to be strumous in its origin, partaking of the nature and ordinary character of “ white swellings.” I have never seen it in young children, and in all the cases which form the basis of these observa- tions it has occurred in young adults from 14 to 30 years old. The exciting- causes of the disease are obscure : I have not been able to trace it to blow' or injui-y in any of the cases that have been nnder my care, althongh there can be very little doubt that such causes might excite it. Pathology.—The disease may commence primarily either in the pebdc bones, or in the articular strnctnres of the sacro-iliac junction. The annexed ffrawdngs (Figs. 481, 482), taken from a boy who died of tetanus fr-om the in'itation of an issue, six weeks after the commencement of disease in the sacro- iliac articulation, show erosion of the cartilages in patches, and clearly illus- trate the existence of primary disease in those structures. The next drawing (Fig. 483), taken from a man abont 30 yeai-s of age, who died of this af- fection after nearly two years of suffering, •shows the disease in its most advanced stage. The bones, though bare and rough, ai-e neither carious nor necrosed ; they appear simply to bo deprived of their incnisting cartilage. There is no deep erosion of them, no cavity, no sign of tuberculous infiltration ; no •e^udcnce, m fiict, of primary osseous disease. The ligamentous structures Hlso of the articulations arc only partially destroyed. The interosseous lio-a- men w-as especially in a sound state ; it had preserved to a great extent I S mmess, and required to be dixided with the scalpel in order to exnosc e mtenor of the joint and the opposed osseous surfaces.

MPTOMS. The symptoms chai’acteristic of this affection aiTange themselves ill five distinct groups viz.. Pain, Swelling, Lameness, Alteration in the Shape of the Limb, and Abscess. These we must study separately. 1. Pain.—One of the earliest symptoms is a sensation of painful weakness at t le lowei part of the back and sacrum, increased by movements of the body in walking, stooping, or even in standing, giving the sensation as if the body were falling asunder. The pain is increased by any effort that calls the respiratoiy muscles into action, such as coughing, sneezing, or laughing, and is greatly aggra- vated by straining at stool. As the disease advances, the pain becomes more continuous, and of a gnawing or rheumatic cha- racter. Its intensity varies greatly; in some instances it is throughout slight, except on movement, in others it is most intensely agoni- sing, the patient shrieking with agony, and unable to obtain rest in any position. It is accom- panied by a peculiar feeling of weakness, of falling asimder, or of want of support in the lower parts of the body. This pain is Fig. 4S3.—Snero-iliac Disease, more advanced. Confined tO the gluteal region and gi’oin, and does not extend far dovm the limb. When the patient is lying on his back or side, the limb on the affected side may be ab- or adducted, or the head of the thigh-bone may be pressed up against the acetabulum, without any increase of pain, provided the pelvis be fixed by the pressure of the hands. If this be not done, considerable, even intolerable pain will be experienced on moving the limb. So, also, if the Surgeon seize the sides of the pelvis in his hands, and move them to and fro, or press them together transversely, or separate them by pressing the anterior superior spines asimder, pain iviU be elicited, the affected joint being then influenced by the movement communicated to it. There is often general and diffused tenderness on pressure over the gluteal region ; but this is less about the hip-joint than in coxalgia, and gradually increases as the finger is pressed backwards upon the sacro-iliac articulation, so that it may at last be localised in a small spot. 2. Swelling.—A puffy intumescence is perceptible early in the disease, along the line of the affected articulation. It assumes a somewhat elongated appearance from above downwards, and does not extend to any distanceABSCESS IN SA-CRO-ILIAC DISEASE. 305 out^Yarcls under the gluteal muscles, nor does it iiirade the natural hoUow behind the trochauter. As the disease advances, and suppuration takes place, the swelling increases materially, and assumes different and peculiar characters, owin" to the formation and diffusion of abscess. ^ 8. ^Lameness is an early symptom. The patient walks insecui'ely ; has a feelin" of want of proper support to the body ; leans forward, and uses a stick.” He puts the foot on the affected side to the ground, but does not tread upon it so fii-mly as upon the other. He cannot stand on the foot of the affected side, or twist himself suddenly round. As the disease advances, the powers of support and progression diminish, and at last the patient becomes unable to assume the erect position, lying in bed usually on the sound side. . 4. Alteration in the Shape of the Hip and Length of the Limh is an eai-ly and marked symptom. From the veiy commencement of the disease, the limb on the affected side will seem to be longer than the sound one ; the tip of the inner malleolus being usually, as the patient hes on his back, half an inch below the level of the same point of bone on the opposite side. But on close examination, it will be found that the measm’ement from the anterior superior spine to the inner malleolus gives the same result on both sides ; hence the elongation cannot be owing to any change that has taken place in the bones or in the three large joints of the lower extremity, but must be dependent on some disturbing cause situated beyond the anterior superior spine of the ilium. On more close investigation, this point of bone is found to be at a lower level, and at the same time more prominent, than its feUow on the opposite side : the displacement is thus produced, not by any obliquity of the peMs consequent on a twist on the lumbar spine, as in hip-joint disease, but by the tilting forwards and rotation downwards of the whole side of the pelvis ; for the displacement which takes place is a double one. The sweUing of the affected articulation not only pushes forwards, but rotates downwards, the anterior and superior portion of the ilium ; and hence the anterior superior spine is not only at a lower level, but is also more prominent on the diseased than on the sound side. The limb itself usually hes straight, and is wasted and enfeebled. 5. Abscess occurs only at a late period of the disease. Many months, a year or more, may elapse before suppuration is fairly established, or, at all events, before the formation of pus is so abundant and so circumscribed that it can be recognised as an abscess. I have obseiwed abscess in connection with this disease in five situations—viz., over the articulation, in the gluteal and in the lumbar regions, rvithin the pelvis, and in connection with the rectum. 1 he first indication of abscess is met with over the diseased articulation. The puffy swelling which is there perceptible in the earlier stages of the affection, ^adually softens, until at last fiuctuation is established in it. From this point it may spread outwards into the gluteal region, nearly as far as, but not enveloping, the trochanter ; or it may take another course and stretch upwards, forming a considerable accumulation in the loin, upon and just above the crest of the ilium. These forms of sacro-iliac abscess are extra- 2Jclvic; the other varieties are inlrajmlvic. These latter are of three kinds In VOL. II, X3o6 DISEASE OF THE SAGliO-ILIAG JOINT. one form the pus passes out of tlie sciatic notch, and under the gluteal mus- cles ; in the other varieties it gravitates downwards into the ischio-rcctal fossa, and presents by the side of the rectum ; and in the third variety which I have ohscn'cd, the abscess opens into this gut, abundant puriform discharge takes place per anum, and, flatus from the bowel passing into the suppurating cavity, a tympanitic abscess results. Progijosis.—The prognosis of this disease is always most unfavourable. I am not prepared to say that it is of necessity fatal, but I have never seen a patient recover after the full development of the disease, and after suppuration had set in. I have, however, seen a case cured, in which, from the history of the symptoms, the thickening over the sacro-iliac articulations, and the permanent displacement of the side of the pehis, there was every reason to believe that this disease had existed. But in this instance no abscess had foimed. Diagnosis.—The diagnosis of sacro-iliac disease is important, and not always easy. There are five distinct affections with which it may he con- founded—viz., neuralgia of the hip, sciatica, spinal disease, coxalgia, and disease of the pelvic hones. 1. Neuralgia of the hip in young females may readily enough be confounded with the earlier stages of sacro-iliac disease. But the Avidely spread and super- ficial nature of the pain in the neuralgic affection, the co-existence of the hysterical temperament, the sex of the patient, and the absence of all limita- tion of morbid action to the neighbourhood of the diseased articulation, render the true nature of the affection sufficiently clear. The obliquity of the pelvis Avhich occasionally occurs in neuralgia of the hip, and causes apparent elonga- tion of the limb, is readily removed when the patient lies on the back ; whereas, in sacro-iliac disease, position does not affect the displacement of the limb on the affected side. 2. Sciatica.—In this affection, the age of the patient, usually more advanced than that of the SAibjects of sacro-iliac disease ; the seat of the pain, beloAV the articulation, and its extent doAAn the back of the limb ; Avith the absence of elongation, Avill enable the Surgeon to effect the diagnosis. 3. From spinal disease, the diagnosis is usually sufficiently easy ; for, although the situation of abscess resulting from caries of the vertebrae may in many cases be the same as that Avhich is occupied by the collections of pus resulting from sacro-iliac disease, yet in caries of the spine, in the vast majority of instances, excinvation of the vertebrae has become prominently marked by the time that the abscess has assumed so great a magnitude as to occupy the inferior lumbar or gluteal regions. In those rare cases in Avhich, as in an instance that Avas some time ago under my care, caries of the vertebrae, with consecutrie abscess, takes place without any angular curA'ature, it will bo found that the patient complains of tenderness on the Surgeon percussing the spine opposite the seat of disease ; that the spinal column has lost its flexibility, moving stiffly and as a whole ; that there is an absence of that elongation of the limb on the affected side, dependent on displacement of the wipg of the pelvis, Avhich is so early obseiwablo in sacro-iliac disease ; and lastly, that examination of the sacro-iliac synchonch'osis neither elicits pain nor reveals .SAvelliiig or any of the other signs of disorganisation of that articulation. 4. Coxahjia is the affection that is most easily conibunded with sacro-iliac3°7 DIAGXOSIS OF SACEO-ILIAG DISEASE. disease, and that from which it is of most importance to make the diagnosis. It is especially from that variety of hip-disease which commences m the acetahnhuu, primarily involves the pelvic bones, and only secondarily im- plicates the joint, that it is difficult to distinguish sacro-iliac disease ; and the importance of effecting this diagnosis is great when we reflect that these cases of hip-disease may now successfully be subjected^ to operative interference, whilst sacro-iliac disease does not admit of relief or removal by these means. The diagnosis between coxalgia in all its forms and the disease we are at present considering may be effected by attention to the following circumstances. a. The seat of pain on pressure varies. In hip-disease the patient suffers most severely when pressure is exercised deeply behind and above the tro- chanter, ill the hollow behind that osseous prominence, or ivhen the com- pression is exercised against the anterior part of the hip-joint through the pectiiieus muscle. In sacro-iliac disease, little or no pain on pressure is experienced in these situations ; but tenderness is elicited by pressure upon the sacrum and along the line of junction between the sacrum and ibum, liehind and altogether away from the hip. d. The movements that occasion pain are different in the two diseases. In hip-disease, abduction and rotation outwards, or pressure of the head of the thigh-bone into the acetabulum, aggravate, to a greater or less degi’ee, often to an mibearable extent, the sufferings of the patient. In sacro-iliac disease the thigh may be moved in aU directions, ab- or adducted, rotated, flexed, or extended, whilst the patient is lying on the back, without any increase of suffering, provided the side of the pelvis be fixed by the Surgeon. Should this precaution not be taken, the movement impressed on the thigh 'wiU be com- municated to the diseased articulation, and wiU necessarily occasion suffering. c. The signs connected with the alteration in the length of the limb differ in the two diseases. In hip-disease there may be, and usually is in the advanced stages, considerable shortening. This never occurs in sacro-iliac disease. In the eailier stages of coxalgia there may be, as there is throughout in sacro-ihac disease, elongation of the hmb. But there is an important point connected with this. The elongation in hip-disease is always appreciable by measuring fr’om the anterior superior spine of the ihum to the inner ankle. In sacro-ihac disease, however, the measurements between these two points on the opposite sides of the body exactly correspond, the seat of the elongation being situated still higher up. d. I he alteration of the level and of the prominence of the two anterior superior spines, in sacro-iliac disease, may be confounded with that arising fr’om the obliquity of the pelvis usually occurring in the early stages of coxalgia. But here also the diagnosis may be effected by obseiwing that the displace- ment of the bone in sacro-iliac disease is poimanent, and is not influenced by position. The obliquity of the pelvis in hip-disease, giving rise to apparent elongation of the limb, is dependent on a twist in the lumbar spine, which may be rectified by placing the patient on his back, and using a little mani- pulation. The alteration in the level of the two ilia, in sacro-iliac disease, is not modified by change of position, or by any movement that may be impressed upon the spine.3oS DISEASE OF THE SACRO-ILIAG JOINT. ^ 5. Dkease of the pelvic hones may of course occur independently of any affec- tion of the sacro-iliac articulation ; and, when so occun’ing, it always com- mences at a distance from the joint—the crest of the ilium, the tuberosity of the ischium, or the acetabulum, being the usual seats of the disease. When it occurs in the first of these two situations, the resulting abscess seldom attains a very large size, and is altogether above or below the synchondi'osis, the outline of which can be felt clear and imobsciu’cd by swelling of any kind. '\Wien the abscesses are opened, the sinuses that result will lead directly down to the rough and carious bone, examination of which will leave no doubt as to the nature of the cases. In these cases, also, no change takes place in the length of the limb, or in the position of the side of the ilium. When the acetabulum is pirimarily affected, the difficulty of diagnosis may be greater, in consequence of the large size and often intrapelvic natm-e of the abscesses, and the co-existence of a certain amount of displacement or elonga- tion of the limb. But here the same circumstances that enable the Siu’geon to effect a diagnosis in ordinary coxalgia—viz,, the pain in movement influencing the hip-joint merely, and the increased length of limb, as determined on mea- suring from the anterior superior spines—wiU prevent his falling into error as to the true natime of this disease. Treatment.—With respect to treatment I have but little to say, and that by no means satisfactory. The treatment must be conducted on the same general principles that guide us in the management of cases of carious diseases of the spine. The gveat' object is to prevent the formation of abscess. If the cure be fortunately accomplished, the patient will probably recover with a limb that, though weakened, is but little impaired in utility; for, the sacro-iliac junction being naturally a fixed joint, it matters little if it become ankylosed by disease. Long-continued rest in the prone position ; fixing the pelvis, hip-joint, and thigh by means of a large leather cap and splint, which should embrace the whole of the limb from above the crest of the ilium to the sole of the foot; counter-irritation, in the earlier stages, before suppuration has set in (after that has occurred it is worse than useless); the administration of cod-liver oil, iron, and suitable tonics, ai’e the means to be employed. When abscess forms, this must be opened in a suitable and convenient spot, when large and chronic by valvular incision ; and keeping up the powers of the patient by ordinary dietetic means and medicinal tonics are the means that must be employed, vdth the view of procuring ankylosis; but usually, unfortunately, with little advantage beyond the mitigation of suffering and the prolongation of life for a limited time. When once suppiuation has set in, our hopes of a cure are materially lessened. I am not prepared to state that the affection is inevitably fatal when it has reached this stage, but certainly in the very great majority of instances it is so ; the profuse discharge fr’om the large abscesses connected with it inducing hectic, and exhausting the powers of life. Xo operative inter- ference is admissible.DISEASE OF THE HIP-JOINT. 309 CHAPTER LII. DISEASE OF THE HIP-JOINT. Hip-disease presents so many points of peculiar and serious importance, that it is usually, and not improperly, considered as a distinct affection, apart from other joint-diseases. Like all these it may be acute, subacute, or chronic, most commonly occiuTing in strumous subjects; indeed, I think its connection Avith scrofula is generally more distinctly marked than that of most other affections of the joints. It almost inyariably occurs before the age of puberty. Out of 48 consecutive cases of this disease, of ■which I took notes, I find that in 16 only did it take place at or after fifteen years of age, and, of these, in 6 cases only it happened above the age of tiventy. The collected statistics of cases appears to give a very similar proportion; thus it may be considered essentially a disease of childhood or early youth. It commonly comes on from very slight causes ; being usually attributed to over-exertion in a long walk, a sprain in jumping, a fall, or sitting in the wet. Fokais oe the Disease.—AU the inflammatory affections attacking the coxo-femoral articrdation are usually confounded under the term “ Hip- Disease” or “ Coxalgia.” This is too general an expression ; and we shall find included under it several distinct forms of disease that differ from one another in pathology, symptoms, result, and treatment. On looking at the hip-joint in a surgical point of 'view, we find it to be composed of three distinct parts ; viz., the soft structures, the acetabulum, and the head of the thigh-bone. Any one of these may be principally or primarily affected ; and Ave may accordingly diAude hip-joint disease into three distinct forms—Arthritic, Acetabular, and Femoral. This division is not purely pathological, but is also practical, espe- cially in its bearing on the question of excision. General Pathological Conditions.—Before proceeding to describe each separate fonn of coxalgia in detail, we may consider briefly the six pathological conditions Avhich are more or less common to each variety of the affection—viz.. Pain, Attitude, Suppmation, Sinuses, Dislocation, and Ankylosis. 1. Pain.—The pain in the hip-joint disease A'aries greatly according to the form which the affection assumes. In the more chronic forms of the disease it is at first slight, and, perhaps, rather referable to the knee than to the hip • this is particularly the case in the femoral Amriety, and may be explained by the iiTitation of the articular branch of the obturator nerve. In the arthritic form it is always veiy acute, even intense, seated in the joint itself, and gi-eatly increased by any movement, however slight, of the limb. In the acetabular form of the disease the pain is not at first refeixed to the joint, but rather to310 DISEASE OF THE HIP-JOINT. the iliac fossa or side of the pehds; it afterwards becomes severe, gnawng, and deeply seated in the articulation. However slight the pain may be, it is always greatly increased by moving the limb, by pressing the surfaces of the articulation together, or by abduction. Hence the patient usually keeps the foot raised and merely supported on the point of the toes, the knee and hip being flexed and adducted. 2. The Attitude of the limb is peculiar, and varies in different stages of the disease. In the early stage the hmb is usually straight, carried slightly for- Avards, or perhaps somewhat abducted, owing to the initation and contraction of the capsular muscles on the anterior and outer aspects of the joint. The attitude of the limb is as foUoAvs. 1. The patient tilts the pelvis to the opposite side so as to raise the diseased limb off the gTOund ; hence there is apparent shortening, though there may be no difference in the length of the limbs or even actual elongation. The anterior superior spine on the affected side will be foimd to be higher than that on the opposite one. 2. The limb is slightly ab- ducted ; and 3, the patient only puts the toes to the ground, the heel being raised. This is done in order to bring the elasticity of the foot into play and to prevent the pain that would arise from the jar of the limb if the patient trod on the heel. As the disease advances, the limb becomes adducted, so that the knee is carried against the lower part of the sound thigh ; it is also flexed and carried forwards in advance of the opposite limb, the action of the external rotators having become interfered with by Avasting and aggiutmation, and the limb coming under the influence of the adductors and flexors. The length of the limb varies greatly at different periods. In estimating the length, we must be careful to discrimi- nate betAveen apparent and real changes. In the early stages there is often apparent elongation to a considerable extent, owing to the oblique position in Avliich the pehos is carried causing the anterior superior spine on the affected side to be an inch or two beloAV the level of that on the healthy side. Often in these cases of apparent elongation there is actual shortening. All this can readily be determined by measurement from the anterior superior spinous process to the inner malleolus of each side. Real elongation is not common, but may occur in consequence of effusion into the joint, and thrusting doAAm of the head, in acute arthritic coxalgia. As the disease adA^ances shortening comes on, from disintegration or dislocation of the head of the bone. The real shortening is often apparently much increased by the oblique tilting of the pelAo's upAvards on the affected side. The real shortening of the hmb is often very easily obseiwable by placing the patient in the sitting posture, Avith the knees bent at a right angle, when it Avill be found that the knee on the side affected does not project so far forwards as the one on the healthy side. 3. Suppuration is not a necessary consequence of inflammation of the hip- joint, though in strumous subjects it more commonly occurs than not. A\e often see the arthritic variety of the disease run its course AAothout suppuration ; but, in the acetabular and femoral, abscess ahvays forms sooner or later, being the direct consequence of the diseased osseous tissue. ^ In the azetabular form, abscess is often one of the eai’liest signs of serious mischief, preceding the othei signs immediately to be mentioned. The abscesses usually form behind t c joint, under the gluteal muscles; they may open in this situation or burroAADISLOCATION^ IN HIP-JOINT DISEASE. 3^^ fTio fmci-i hta and present on the outer aspect of the thigh below the to SOI- vi-inic t'emoris.

There are thrL situations in which sinuses are met with, which ^ ary accoid- inc- to their point of origin from the abscess, and the positmn of the diseased hmie : hence it is of importance to note their site and direction. 1 ^Tienthe sinus opens two or three inches below and a little m front of the great trochanter, about the insertion of the tensor vagime femoris muscle, the disease is almost invariably femoral. 2. When the sinus is in the glutea,! region, i may inchoate femoral, but not unfi’equently is dependent on felvic disease ; the acetabulum, or a portion of the dorsum ilii, being the part involved. ^ 3. Tj,ie sinus may open in the pubic region, either above or below Poupart’s ligament: in this situation it is almost certainly diagnostic of disease ol the joelvic bones, especially the pubic aspect of the acetabulum. When it appears aloove the ligament, it probably leads to intrapelvic abscess : on the other hand, ivhen it . opens Moio Poupart’s ligament, there is generally disease of the rami of the pubes or ischium. The situation of the sinuses, as well as their direction, will thus be found to be of the greatest value in leading the Surgeon to a more accurate diagnosis of the seat and extent of the osseous disease than he could otherwise form. And, indeed, it is only by attention to these circumstances that he is enabled in many cases to form an approximate opinion on these points ; for the diseased bone is often so covered in by healthy osseous structure, as when the inner aspect of the great trochanter is affected, or by plastic matter, that the probe cannot touch it; or the sinus may be so tortuous that a straight probe cannot follow its A\dndings. Sayre’s vertebrated probe (Fig. 406) is veiy useful in these cases. But there is other important information obtainable fi’om an attentive con- sideration of the situation of the sinuses. It is with reference to the probable natiu-e of the osseous disease. In femoral coxalgia, this is almost invariably caries —sometimes simple, in other cases tuberculous; hence those sinuses that indicate the existence of primary disease of the upper epiphysis of the thigh-bone prove this to bo of a carious natm’e ; whilst, on the other hand, sinuses occuiTing in the pul)ic region and by Poupart’s ligament are almost invariably dependent on the presence of necrosed bone—necrosis being the form of disease that affects the acetabulum and pelvic bones. 5. Dislocation.—In the advanced forms of hip-disease, dislocation of the head of the thigh-bone commonly occurs, and may arise from three causes. a. The joint may be destroyed ; the capsular ligament having given way in consequence of inflammatory softening and ulceration, and the head of the bone being thrown out of the cavity by the action of the surrounding muscles. b. Caries and partial absorption of the head of the thigh-bone may have taken place, so that it no longer fills up the cotyloid cavity ; and, the ligaments beingDISEASE OF THE HIP-JOINT. 312 at the same time destroyed, it slips out on to the dorsum ilii (Fig. 484). A fungus fibro-plastic mass may sprout up from the bottom of the cavity, and thus tend to push the bone out of it; and, after it has been so extruded, this gTowth will completely fill the acetabulum. The occurrence of dislocation is, in the great'majority of cases, preceded by the formatiozi of abscess in and around the joint; but in some instances it happens in consequence apparently of the softening of the hgaments, the head of the bone being throAvn out of the acetabulum without the supeiwention of abscess or any sign of suppuration. In these cases a false joint may be formed upon the dorsum ilii, where the bone lodges. When it is lying in a suppu- rating cavity it wiU always be found to be in a carious state, and then no attempt, or at most an imperfect one, is made at the construction of an articu- lation aroimd it. Dislocation takes place chiefly in the fmnoral variety of the disease, in which the head of the thigh-bone is more or less destroyed, and the acetabulum is filled with fibro-plastic deposit, which is reparative material, developed in those cases in which the lining cartilaginous surface of the joint has been re- moved, leaving roughened bone, which thus becomes covered. The formation of this material is interest- ing, as showing the pos- sibility of repair in the ace- tabulum when it is only secondarily affected. In the acetabular form, the posi- tion of the head of the bone is more uncertain. In some cases it is dislocated upon the dorsum ilii; in other instances, the head of the bone is not thrown out of the cotyloid cavity ; but this, being carious, and be- coming at last perforated, may allow the upper end of the thigh-bone to shp into the pelvis. G. Ankylosis may occur either with or zvithout pre- vious suppuration. If the joint have suppurated and the head of the bone be throzvn on the dorsum ilii, a false joint may eventually^ form, or osseous ankylosis in a more or less faulty position take place. If the head ot tbc bone continue in the acetabuhmr without suppuration, osseous ankylosis may ensue with but little shortening of the limb. . ip <> • • Pathology.—It is not often that the opportunity presents itsclfof examimiia TTicr 4S4 —Acute Disease of Hiii-joint in nn AiUat.

IARTHRITIC COXALGIA. 313 ti hip-joint in the earlier stages of coxalgia, before complete disorganization of the joint has taken place. The following were, however, the appearances that were fomid in a child about eight years of age, who died in the Hospital of ■pneumonia, and whose body was carefully examined by Wilson Fox. The disease of the hip had only existed about six w eeks. The joint, which, including the acetabulum and capsule, was removed entire, contained a considerable quantity of dirty yellow pus. The ligamentum teres was flattened and covered with spots of yellow lymph ; it was much softened, so as to tear -with the gveatest ease. The synovial membrane was generally gxeatly thickened, intensely injected, of colom* varying from^ bright red to dull orange, and covered by spots of yellow lymph. The cartilage lining the acetabulum appeared to be healthy, except just around the insertion of the ligamentum teres, where it was softer and more gelatinous-looking than normal for about one to two lines. The cartilage iucrusting the head of the femim appeared at first sight to be entirely unaffected. On making a vertical section through the acetabulum, and the head and neck of the femur, the great trochanter was found almost entirely unossified, with the exception of a point m its centre, and its connection to the bone was weak and easily tom asunder. The epiphysis of the head was completely ossified ; the fine of junction being still, however, marked by a band of bluish and very hard cartilage, which extended for about three lines on each side across the bone. In the centre of this, extending both into the epiphysis and the diaphysis, was an eburnated portion of bone, yeUow, hard, dense, and com- pact, these pecuharities being most marked in the portion belonging to the diaphysis. In both j)arts this mass contrasted strongly in colour and in consistence with the reddened cancellous tissue. The incrusting cartilage, though generally appearing healthy externally, could now be seen to be a good deal worm-eaten internally, and indeed, destroyed at one or two points. Where the mass of hard bone came near the surface, the refiexipn of the synovial membrane was destroyed. Below this, in the neck and the upper part of the shaft, the cancellous tissue was very lax, the walls being very thin, and the medulla filling them extraordinarily red. The medulla at the com- mencement of the medullary canal, about one inch and a half below the tro- chanter, was exceedingly red and vascular. Occupying many spots of the cancellous tissue, and also one or two of the reddened medulla, were many little masses of the size of miUet-seeds, looking like transparent cartilage, hard and resisting, yielding no juice, not breaking down at aU easily under the finger, tom with difficulty by the needle, and when torn showing great numbers of nuclei and fibres. They pervaded the whole bone, and were also found in t e acetabulum, but in smaller numbers. Some of them could easily bo enu- cleated where the medulla was soft, others could only be separated with diffi- culty from the cancellous bone. Fiom this account it is easy to perceive that the disease was tuberculous,- that It commenced in the osseous structures, chiefly of the femiu ; and that it secondarily implicated the soft articular structures. Arthritic Coxalgia.—The arthritic form of hip-joint disease may com- mence m any of the soft structures of the joint; in the capsule, the synovia membrane, the cartilages, or the round ligament. These are alone primarily3M DISEASE OF THE HIP-JOIET. effected, usually Avitli acute inflammation prcscuting the characters of arthritis in other joints, and the disease generally continues limited to those structures tkroughout. Aston Key believed that the round ligament was very fi-equcntly the starting-point of inflammation of the hip-joint, and other Surgeons have referred its origin to each of the other structures mentioned. Without denyinf>- the possibility of disease sometimes commencing in the ligaments, illustrative of which we have a beautiful model in the Museimi of University Colleo-e, I ' believe that it more frequently appears first in the cartilage incrusting the head of the thigh-bone ; for, though it is extremely difficult to prove this, opportu- nities of dissecting this form of hip-disease in its early stages being very rare, yet the symptoms that attend it so closely resemble those accompanying the diseases of the articular cartilage in other joints, that it is difficult not to infer that this may be the case in the hip. ; Symptoms.—In this form of the disease the patient is seized with signs of acute inflammation of the joint, coming on rather rapidly, and with great ' constitutional disturbance and pyrexia. The pain in the joint in these cases is most excruciating, accompanied by spasms and twitchings of the limb, and marked by noctinnal exacerbations. The suffering is so intense, that the patient cannot bear the slightest movement of the limb ; a fit of cougliing, the weight of the bed-clothes, or the shaking of the bed by a person leaning against it will give rise to the most intense agony ; and in the intervals of his suffering the patient is in constant fear of a retinn of the pain, to which he looks forward with much anxiety. In these cases the limb is everted, abducted, perfectly helpless, and motioidess : the nates will be found flattened, and there is usually some fuhiess about the anterior part of the joint, under the pectineus muscle, or to its outer side, above the trochanter. There is also sometimes true elongation of it, in consequence of the capsule becoming distended with ^ fluid, and pushing the head of the bone downwards. On measining the hmb, in order to ascertain its true length, it is necessary to examine the two together, and to place the sound in exactly the same position as the diseased one ; uidess this be done, error will very probably creep in, for, on measuring the lower extremity from the anterior superior iliac spine to the lower border of the patella or the inner ankle, it will be found to be of greater length when adducted or extended than when abducted or bent. In some cases the distension of the capsule with synovial fluid, as the result of the inflammation in the joint, may be so great as to lead to its rupture, and to the sudden dislocation of the head of the bone on to the dorsimi ilii, with great pain and much shortening ; this, however, is of very rare occurrence, the dislocation seldom taking place until after abscess has formed within the joint, and the articulation has been thus destroyed. ' Results.—Ill this, the arthritic form of hip-disease, various terminations may take place ; the result dependmg greatly upon the constitution of the patient, and on the mamier in Avhich the affection is treated. In the most ffxvourable cu’cumstances, as the inflammatory action is subdued, the disease falls into the subacute condition, and recovery gradually but very slowly takes place, with a limb that continues somewhat stiff and partially ankylosed, as ucll as Avasted and somexvhat shortened Ifom disuse. Sometimes complete ankylosis ocems Awthout the proA'ious fonnation of abscess. In the majority of instances.FEMORAL COXALGIA. 315 however, abscess forras, and then the patient may either be worn out by the continued irritation of diseased bone, or by the profnseness of the discharge ; or, great shortening taking place either by the absorption of the head of the bone, or its dislocation out of the acetabulum, the cavity of the abscess may ultimately contract, the carious portions of bone exfoliate, and the sinuses close after years of suffering. In the most favourable circumstances, when once the joint has been acutely inflamed, a year or two will elapse before the patient can use his limb with any degree of security. The safety of the patient depends in a great measiu-e on preventing the occurrence of suppuration. If the constitution be very strimrous, this can rarely be done ; but, if it be toler- ably healthy, the disease may be prevented from passing on to this stage, and then the patient may recover with an useful though somewhat stiff and crippled limb. If suppiu'ation occur, it is very seldom that an adult patient recovers, hectic and exhaustion speedily carrying him off. The lives of children may, however, be saved even in these circumstances ; but they Avill be left pennauently lamed. Acetahtilar Coxalgia.—In the acetabular form, the disease originates in the pelvic bones, and the articulation and head of the thigh-bone are only secondarily involved. The disease of the peMc bones bras more of the character of necrosis than of caries ; but the two morbid conditions are in many cases co-existent, the acetabulum being carious, whilst the rami of the pubes and ischium are necrosed. The soft articular structiu-es speedily become disor- ganised ; the cartilage incrustiug the head of the thigh-bone is absorbed ; the femoral head itself becomes eroded rather than carious ; but the disease does not extend into the neck or trochanters. This form of hip-joint disease is more common in adults than any other variety. The SymiAoms are usually obscine in the early stages, but become very unequivocal as the disease advances. There is pain around the hip rather than in the joint itself; this, however, becomes tender on pressure, and the patient cannot bear on the limb, but no alteration takes place in its length, although it becomes greatly Avasted. Abscess invariably foims, perhaps at fh-st within the pehic caA'ity ; but it soon presents externally. Sometimes it passes down by the side of the rectum, or through the sciatic notch to the gluteal region; but generally it points near the pubes, under Poupart’s ligament. Hectic comes on; the sufferings are greatly increased ; and death from ex- haustion speedily ensues in this, Avhich is by far the most fatal form of hip-disease. In cases of this form, dislocation, though it is met with now and then, rarely takes place. Sometimes, however, the destruction of the acetabu- lum IS so extensive that the head of the thigh-bone penetrates it, and passes m 0 0 pelvic caA’ity. Dislocation is most frequent AAden the disease has es loye the head of the bone ; so that, the head being no longer present, no impediment is offered to the action of the muscles around the "joint, and the bone at length slips from its position in the cavity of the acetabulum. Femoral Coxalgia.—In the femoral fonn of coxalgia, the morbid action commences in the upper epiphysis of the thigh-bone. Tlie progress of this A arie y 0 coxalgia is veiy insidious : its symptoms are by no means prominent • o -wr if > I 0 I„in.

This form of coxalgia is accompanied inevitably by the foimation of abscess in the soft parts around the joint, commonly on the outside of the thigh, and in the gluteal region ; the articular surfaces are eventually destroyed, and the head of the bone becomes carious and is displaced, leading to shortening and distortion of the limb ; the disease very generally terminates in death from exhaustion and hectic. Sym^iioms.—The disease usually commences veiy insidiously. It assumes a subacute character, and is chiefly met udth in young chikhen. The first symptom that usually attracts attention is, that the child limps and walks in a peculiar shuffling, hopping manner ; he does not stand firmly upon both feet, but rests on the toes of the affected hmb, the knee of which is bent. The limb will be seen to be e'S’erted, somewhat abducted, slightly flexed upon the thigh, with the knee partly bent, and apparently shorter than the other. This shortening, however, , is apparent, and not real; for on laying the child on its back, it will be found that the pelvis is placed obliquely ; the anterior superior spine on the affected side being raised to a higher level than that on the sound one, and at the same time tmmed somewhat forwards. Measurement of the hmb from this pofrit to the ankle will show that there -is no alteration in its length. The obliquity of the pelvis, which is of veiy early occmTence in diseased hip, is owing to the child lifting the foot oflT the gTOund in order to avoid pressure on it in walking or miming; and in doing this he is obliged to raise, not only the limb, but the con-esponding side of the pelvis. This apparent shortening will commonly give place, after keeping the child in bed for a few days, to a simulated elongation of the hmb ; the pelvis on the affected side descending below its natural level. At the same time that these symptoms are noticed, the child usually complains of pain in the hip, especially on pressing over the pectineus muscle, or behind the trochanter ; this is increased by standing, walking, or any attempt to bear upon the joint ; abduction also, and rotation of the hmb outwards, are particularly painful, and any concussion of it, as by striking the heel or knee, will greatly increase the suffering. At this stage of the disease, the patient wifi often refer to the knee rather than the hip as the seat of pain, and a careless Surgeon might be misled and treat the wrong joint; the more so, as there is not unfrequently a good deal of cutaneous sensibihty about the inner side of the knee-joint. This pain appears to be seated in the obturator nerve ; the articular branch of which, sent to the hip-joint, becoming imphcated in the disease, commimicates a radiating pain that is felt at the extremity of the long descending branch which is distributed to the knee. On tinning the child upon its face it will be observed that the nates are somewhat flattened, the fold being in a great measure obhterated; and, if it be a female, the labium on the affected side will be seen to be placed at a lower level than on the soimd one. As the disease advances, abscesses may form at any part in the vicinity of the joint. They most commonly occur under the glutei muscles ; but sometimes at the anterior part, under the pectineus muscle. When in this situation, they occasionally give rise to very severe suttering down the mnev side of the thigh by exercising pressure upon the obturator nerve, which may sometimes become tightly stretched over the subjacent cyst of the abscess.PROGNOSIS OF HIP-JOINT DISEASE. 3^7 It is about this period that true shortening of the limb takes place, at the same time bLmes ab'dueted and inverted thus assuming ^ position from that which it presented m the early stage of the disease. The diftcrent positions into Avhich the limb falls in the two stages of the complaint are evidently due to altera- tions in the muscular action brought to bear upon it. In the early stage, the strong external rotators, which arc in close relation with the joint, become ir- ritated by the extension of inflammatory action to them, or hy the pressm-e to which they are exposed by the distended capsule ; and hence, these being called into increased action, the hmb is everted, at the same time that it is shghtly flexed and abducted by the irrita- tion to Avhich the psoas and iliacus are subjected. As the disease advances, these muscles become wasted, undergo fatty degene- ration, absorption, or disintegration, by the formation of abscesses underneath and around them ; hence, the action of the adductor muscles being no longer counterbalanced, the limb is drawn upwards and forwards, and turned inwards (Fig. 485). The shortening of the limb may arise, in very chronic cases, from general atrophy of the member, consequent upon disuse ; and this, no doubt, in all instances after a time influences its condition. Most commonly, however, shortening occurs from absorption of the head of the bone, which is usually at the same time dislocated upon the dorsum of the ilium. In these cases, the remains of the dislocated head can be felt through the thin and weakened muscles in its new situation, and in other instances may be found lying at the bottom of a cavity in a carious state (Fig. 48 G). Prognosis of Hip-Joint Disease.—The prognosis in cases of diseased hip must be regarded from two points of view—1, as concerns the Life of the Patient; 2, as to the Utility of the Limb that will be left.

Life.—Disease of the hip-joint, and of the contiguous osseous structm’es, is dangerous to life in proportion to the abundance and the long continuance of the suppuration; and this is dependent partly on the patient's constitution, but chiefly, and in the first degree, on the extent and nature of the osseous disease. In the arthritic fonn of coxalgia, suppuration is often prevented by rest and appropriate treatment; and when this is the case, the patient null usually recover. If suppuration take place in cases of this kind, recovery need318 DISEASE OF THE HIP-JOINT. not be despaired of; but coin^alesccnee will be greatly protracted. In such cases much will depend on the patient’s constitution. If that bo highly scrofulous, tubcrculisation in other organs, more particularly in the lungs or spine, may probably take place, and destroy life. IMieu the bones that enter into the composition of and that surround the hip-joint are diseased, the case at once assumes a much graver aspect. Some Surgeons are of opinion, that if caries exist the patient must die. In this doctrine I cannot concur. I believe that much will depend on the situation and extent of the caricSj and on the question whether it be primary and tuberculous, or secondary to disease of the soft joint-structm’es. In the latter case the head of the bone, denuded of its incrusting cartilage, softened and carious upon the surface, may be thrown on to the dorsum ilii; profuse and long-continued suppiuation will ensue, yet, under good and careful management, and without operation, I have in some instances seen recovery take place. In those cases in which the disease is primarily femoral, and dependent upon tubercular deposit in the head of the thigh-bone, the prognosis, if the case be not subjected to operation, is very unfavourable. Here we have a form of caries in Avhich there is no prospect of spontaneous cure ; and the patient will be worn out by hectic, induced by the long-continued and iiTcmediable sup- puration resulting from the irritation excited by the dislocated and carious femoral head irr the ghrteal region. The corrdition of the pelvic- hones is one that more materially thair any one other cirerrmstarree influerrees the prognosis in cases of coxalgia. When the acetabnhrm alone of these bones is affected, the prognosis will tur-n upoir whether this acetabrrlar disease be primary or secondary. If it be primary, intrapelvic abscess rvill probably form, pointing above Poupart’s ligament; arrd whether the head of the thigh-borre be dislocated or not, I believe that death must necessarily ensue, unless the diseased osseous structures be excised. If it be secondary to disease of the head of the thigh-bone, irr which the primary mischief has developed, the condition of the acetabulmn need not seriously affect the prognosis. In these cases the head of the bone becomes dislocated, and this very displacement is the first step towards the erme of the disease in the acetabulmn. The sruface of this cavity, which is roughened, arrd deprived of its incrusting cartilage, speedily becomes covered by gr’anu- lations. These nrrdergo fibroid transformation; arrd irr the coru’se of a short time the whole cavity becomes fiUed up by a dense elastic fibroid o-vowth, which is in fact the medium of repair of the diseased and disrrsed acetabular cavity. When the morbid actiorr extends to the osseous structrmes arouird the aceta- bulum, such as the rami of the ischium and pubes, the body and the trrberosity of the ischium arrd the upper lip of the acetabulum, and even the dor-srrm of the ilirrm, the disease usually partakes more of the nature of necrosis thair of caries, and is perfectly incrnable, except by operation. In exterrsrve pelvic disease such as this, natru’al means arc qrrite unable to effect a cure, and the patient must die of hectic or intercun-ent disease, unless recourse be had to ex- cision of the head of the thigh-bone and the whole of the necrosed and carious osseous structures.OF DISEASE OF THE HIP. 319 THE ATM ENT ■> UtiUty of tUo Limb.-Arhou once the hip-joint has become inflamed, nimi 01 ta lameness will im ariably icsnlt, however camfnlly condneted the treatment mav be. The amount of lameness may consist in a more stiftoess 1 ' t the bin a difficulty in abduction, in flexion of the thigh on the pelvis, m i" free rotoMon : or it may extend to absolute usclessnoss of the shortened withered and deformed limb, which hangs powerless from the pehns, suspended as it were l>y the ilio-femoral ligament, and slightly flexed and adducted. The extent of lameness will depend chiefly upon the form of the disease, and to some extent upon the treatment adopted ; but some will ever be lef . ^en the coxalo-ia is arthritic, and suppuration has not taken place, ankylosis of a more or less complete fom will usuaUy ensue ; and if the thigh haye been kept in the straight position, a sufficiently useM limb will be left, but slightly shortened, and possessing free compensating movement in the lumbar spine, cnablino- the patient to swing it with facility as he walks. If suppimation have taken place, and the head of the bone have been absorbed or dislocated, the limb, even under the most judicious treatment, will be left considerably short- ened, weakened, wasted, and more or less adducted, vith the knee carried somewhat forwards, as well as inwards, and the patient walking often most imperfectly and vith great difficulty on the points of his toes. Diagxosis.—In making the diagnosis of coxalgia, care must be taken not to confound it in its early stages with an ordinary attack of rheutaatism, a mistake that not imfrequeutly happens. The alteration in the shape and position of the hmb, the obliteration of the fold of the nates, and the limitation of the pain to one joint, will usually prevent the Surgeon from falling into this eiTor. With disease of the knee, care must be taken not to confound hip-disease, in consequence of the pain in the early stages being commonly refeired to the foiTucr joint; here the absence of any positive sign of disease about the knee, and the existence of aU the signs of disease in the hip that have already been noticed, will enable the Surgeon to diagnose the true seat of the affection. Lateral curvature of the spine, accompanied by neuralgic tenderness in the hip, occasionally gives rise to apparent shortening of the limb with pain and rigidity; but in these cases the existence of the spinal affection, the superficial nature of the pain, and the absence of increase of suffering when the joint is firmly com- pressed, or of painful startings at night, will indicate the true natiu’e of the affection. Alscess may occasionally, though rarely, form in the vicinity of the Irip without that joint being diseased. Should this take place towards the anterior aspect of the articulation under the pectineus muscle, it may, by its pressure upon the obturator nerve, occasion pain in the thigh and knee, as in those cases in which the articulation is affected ; here, however, the soiuid state of the joint at its posterior and outer part, the absence of all obliquity of the pelvis, and of the other signs of the true hip-disease, will enable the diagnosis to be effected. The diagnosis fr’om sacro-iliac disease has been described at p. 307. Treatment.—The treatment of disease of the hip must be conducted with reference to the form of the disease, the acuteness of the attack, and the severity of the local and constitutional sjrmptoms. In all cases, this affection must be managed in accordance vdth those general principles that guide us in the treatment of inflamed joints.DISEASE OF THE HIP-JOINT. 320 It is of especial importance to adopt early measures. If we ■wisli to prevent tire occurrence of suppuration, dislocation, or ankylosis, the child must, on the supervention of the earliest symptoms of impending mischief about the joint, be put under proper constitutional treatment, and complete rest of the limb must be secured by a well-fitting leather splint. By early attention, a cure may be effected ; whereas, if the case be neglected in its first stages, the utmost ' I the Surgeon can do is to save the life of the patient; the limlj invariably )f falling into a shortened, withered, and distorted condition. ' When the disease is of the acute Arthritic kind, the patient must of course be kept in bed, and absolutely at rest, and be treated with calomel and opium freely administered, having a full dose of an opiate at night, in order to prevent the painful startings of the limb. The inflamed joint must be comfortably ' arranged upon pillows, so as to be kept in as easy a position as possible ; and '■ great relief wiU be afforded to the patient by the appheation of hot poppy- 4 fomentations. But no treatment will be of the slightest avail, unless Ave adhere rigidly to that principle which is paramount in the management of all acutely inflamed joints—absolute rest. Izi inflammation of the hip-joint, there are two methods of securing this : 1, by means of a weight attached to the limb ; 2, by I the long splint. Of the two methods, that by a weight is the best, as it enables 1 the Sm’geon to make any necessary application to the hip AAlthout distmbing ? the apparatus. In applying extension by means of a weight, the following plan j should be adopted (Fig. 487). The patient is placed on a hard mattress. The k pelvis and body are fixed to the bed by means of broad felt straps and buckles. jj I Fig. 4S7.—Apparatus for Extension Tjy Weights in Hip-joint Disease. A leather ankle-strap is then placed round the foot and lower part of the leg, and a padded belt above the knee. From the sides of each of these, straps arc carried to a point six or eight inches beyond the foot, where they are attached to a transverse iron rod, four inches long. From this the cord suspending ^ the weight passes over a puUey-frame fixed to the end of the bed. The weight applied should be from two to three pounds in childi’cn up to six yeai’s of age ; four pounds betiveen the ages of six and ten ; five or six pounds froin ten to thirty. If the long splint be used, it must be apphed as for fractured thigh, but without the perineal band. When the inflammatory action has been some- what subdued, the joint may be conveniently fixed by means of a eat ci sp ui321 TREATMENT OF FEMORAL COXALGIA. or the starched baiidagv. Of the two I prefer the starched bandage, as being more easily aj^plied, and forming a better fitting and more seciu-e casing to the limb. In applying it, the limb should be bandaged from the toes upwards, and Avell padded about the knee with cotton wadding, and the bandage should be can-ied in repeated turns round the hip and body in the form of a spica ; at the posterior part of the hip it should be strengthened with a piece of pasteboard lined with caheo, sufficiently long to extend down the whole of the back of the thigh to below the knee, so as to support that joint also. It is of much im- portance to do this, as otherwise the hip cannot be kept immovable. In apply- ing this, or any other appai’atus, in the more acute form of the disease, the patient inll commonly require to have chlorofonn administered, as the pain occasioned by the necessary movements would otherwise be too severe to be borne. After the starched bandage has well set, a trap may be cut in it opposite any part of the joint to which it may be thought necessary to make applications ; and the perineal aspect of the apparatus must be well lined and covered with oiled silk, so as to prevent its being injuriously soiled. In this way the hmb may be immovably fixed in a proper position by a light and firm apparatus, which will seldom require to be changed during the treatment of the case. A very ingenious and useful extending apparatus for hip-joint disease, at any period of its development, from the earliest to that of abscess, has been invented by Sayre (see Fig. 488). By means of this aouaratus. extensinn is maria Fig. 48S.—SajTo’s Extending Apparatus for Hip-joint Disease.322 DISEASE OF THE IIIP-JOINT. course of moderate alteratives and tonics conjoined will be found most adyn,, tageous. To children, a powder composed of agi-ain of mercury and chalk, two giains of carbonate of soda, and three of rhubarb, with or Avithout half a erain of quinine, may be administered tAvice a day. For adults, the bichloride of Fig. 489.—Tlioinas’s Hii>Apparatus. mercury in small doses, AAuth sarsaparilla or bark, will be found most useful. This alterative plan must be persevered in for a sufficient length of time; and, as the symptoms of inflammatory action subside, and those of strumous disease manifest themselves more imequivocally, cod-liver oil, Avith the iodide of potas- sium or of iron, may be adA^antageously substituted. During the whole of the treatment, the general health requires cai’eful supervision. The diet must be attended to, and should be as nutritious as possible ; the state of the boAvels regulated ; the skin kept in good action AA'ith a flesh-brush ; and the patient should reside in Avell-ventilated apai’tments. It will very generally be found that the liAm’ is peculiaily apt to got out of order in this disease, the patient becoming jaundiced and feverish ; this complication must be treated on general principles. As the health imijroves, a change to the seaside will be attended Avith great advantage ; and the patient may beEXCISION OF THE HEAD OF THE FEMUR. 323 tilloweJ to move about on crutches, having the foot suspended in a sling, as in the case of fractured thigh. In such circumstances, the best result that can usually be looked for is a stiff joint; but, even if this form, the patient’s con- dition will be far from unfavourable, for the want of movement in the hip becomes counterbalanced by the greatly increased mobility of the lumbar vertebriB, enabling the patient freely to rotate the pelvis. As abscesses form, they should be opened early ; no good results from delay- ing to give e.xit to the pus, Avhich only spreads more widely, disorganising the soft structures. Means should be taken, by tonic remedies and nourishing food, to keep off hectic. If dislocation have taken place, and the limb conse- quently have become a good deal shortened or deformed, being perhaps adducted •and inverted so far as to be twisted over the other, or drawn up upon the abdomen, much may be done to lessen the deformity by putting the patient under chloroform, bringing down the limb, and fixing it in a starched bandage. Ankylosis in a good position may thus be sometimes obtained, and the patient’s condition be gi-eatly improved. It is a question whether an attempt at reduction should be made in these cases of consecutive dislocation, as it is very rai'ely that it would prove permanently successful, the acetabulum being either filled up \vith fibrous matter, or the head of the bone so diseased and lessened in size, that it would not remain in its cavity when put back. Occasionally, however, reduction may be successfidly effected. In a woman under my care at the Hospital, with spontaneous dislocation of the hip of about a month’s diu'ation, reduction was effected by means of the pulleys, and the head of the bone re- placed in the cotyloid cavity, where it remained for some weeks ; becoming, however, displaced again in consequence of its being necessary to remove a bandage that was applied, as she became affected with inflammation of the chest, and could not bear its pressure. If ankylosis be likely to occm*, the Siu’geon must endeavour to seem’e it with the limb in a straight position ; otherwise gieat inconvenience to the }Datient may result, especially if it occur ux the position represented in Fig. 495. After a stiff joint has formed, the mobility of the lumbar vertebrax, and more particularly of the lumbo-sacral articulation, will be found to be gi’eatly increased : so that at last the patient wiU walk with httle mconvemence, rotating the pelvis on them. If the ankylosis be not osseous, but the result of the arthritic form of the disease, and especiaUy if the head of the bone be still in the acetabulum, the limb may be straightened by forcible extension and rotation under chloroform, and the heel thus brought to XCISION OF THE HEAD OP THE THIQH-BONE AND OF THE HIP-JOINT. f propose, and Anthony White, 1^ minster Hospital, in 1821, was the first to perform, excision of the nca 0 le emur.

But in the meamvhile it had not entirely escaped the attention of continental Surgeons. Oppenheim, in 1829, and Seutin, in 1832, exeised the head of the femnr for gun-shot injury ; and, in 1842, Textor published an essay on the subject. Since the operation was removed by Fergusson, in 184r.^ it has been frecpiently performed, and may now he looked upon, notwithstand- ing the violence with which it has been assailed, as being an established surgical procedure in appropriate cases. Cases requiring Operation.—Diseases of and about the hip-joint may, so far as the question of operation is concerned, be divided into two great classes —those in which no suppuration takes place, however acute the inflammation may have been ; and those in which abscess forms. To the first class belongs the arthritic variety of the disease, in which the synovial membrane and cartilages are primarily affected. In this foim of coxalgia, the patient commonly recovers with a stiffened or even completely ankylosed, though useful and straight limb, dislocation of the head of the bone not having ocemred. In such cases, I believe that excision is never needed ; at least, I have never had occasion to do it, nor have I ever seen a case that seemed to me to justify such a procedure. The second class of cases—those in which abscess forms—are by far the most numerous. In the great majority of these, however, the head of the femur is the part primarily affected, and in these recovery will take place even- tually, under properly conducted medico-surgical treatment. But the recovery in such cases is always so far incomplete that the limb is left much crippled, and often of but little utility. In cases of this kind, after years of suffering- arid confinement to bed, and after a hard struggle for existence, we find the- rurfortunate patient left eventually with a limb that is shortened to the extent of from two to four inches, wasted and adducted, with a projecting deformed hip seamed with cicatrices ; the remains of the upper epiphysis of the thigh- bone being dislocated from the acetabulum, and adherent to the dorsum ilii by firm ankylosis. The limb is unable to support the body, and cannot be extended, nor can the sole of the foot be firmly planted on the gTOund ; but the leg is to a certain extent useful in progression, the patient using it as a kind of paddle to push himself on with, as he limps on the point of the toes. In these cases it is interesting to observe how nature compensates for the loss of all abduction and rotatory power in the hip by giving an extremely increased degree of mobility to the lumbar vertebim ; so that the patient, in walking, swings the pelvis from these, and thus in a great degree makes up for the loss of the natural movements in the coxo-femoral articulation. But though recovery takes place eventually, in the great majority of cases of coxalgia that have even advanced to suppuration, yet in some and not a few instances the patient’s constitution becomes unequal to the drain im- posed upon it, and fatal hectic eventually supervenes. This is the direct consequence of the wasting and exhausting influence of the long-continued discharge of pus from masses of carious or necrosed bone, too extensive or too deeply seated to be eliminated by the natural actions of the part. It is in such cases as these that conservative surgery steps in, and endeavoura to save the patient’s life by the removal of the morbid cause that keejis up t ic discharge which is wasting it away. The object here is simply to saie i oOPERATION' JN FEAIORAL COXALGfA. 3^5 l)j tlic removal of diseased bone. For the same reason—the preservation of life from hcctie—that the Surgeon amputates in an extreme case of suppu- rating disorganisation of the loiee-joint, he excises in an extreme ® disorganisation of the osseous structures that enter into the foi-mation of the hip-joint: amputation is Irere too formidable a proceeding to be mrdertaken, and yet the removal of the diseased bone, the irritotion and suppuration from ■which is rapidly destroying the patient, is an imperative necessity. And licre it is impossible not to be struck with the strange inconsistency o t ose Surgeons n'ho, looking upon caries of the bones entering into the conformation of tire hip-joint as necessarily fatal, yet condemn as improper the only means of saving the patient’s life—viz., the excision of the diseased osseous strrrctm-es —and blame others for performing an operatiorr which has saved the lives of numerous jratients affected by a disease which they themselves have declared to be incurable. The Femoral coxalgia is that form of the disease that is most benefited by operation. In sev’ere and extreme cases of this ■s’ariety of hip-joint disease, the upper epiphysis of the thigh-bone will be found lying in a state of caries on the dorsum ilii, irr a suppm’ating cavity, with sirruses leading dowrr to it. The pelvic bones arc sound ; the acetabulum is filled by fibro-plastic matter of a reparative character, though possibly it may be slightly roughened arrd necrosed at one lip. The soft structures in the gluteal region are thinned and wasted ; the limb is incurably shortened, atrophied, and adducted. In such cases as these, the patient will probably perish, if left to the unaided efforts of nature ; or if he recover, after years of suffering, it wiU be with a limb [shortened, deformed, and but little useful. Resection, being limited to the upper end of the thigh-bone, or at most to the roughened lip of the acetabulum as well, is an easy operation, removes the cause of the wasting discharges and hectic, and in no way increases the already existing shortening, as it is limited to that portion of diseased bone which is already lying above and behind the acetabulum, and which is affected by incurable caries of too extensive and deep-seated a character to disintegrate and crumble away in the discharges, so that a natural cure 'udthout operation could take place. Excision of the head of the femur has hitherto been done almost exclusively in advanced cases of the disease ; but Aiinandale advises that recomse be had to it in the earlier stages. In those cases of hip-disease in which signs of .suppuration are present, he recommends that an antiseptic exploratory incision be made into the joint, and the head of the femin examined ;—if found diseased, it should be removed by sawing though its neck. Should there bo osseous disease beyond this in the acetabulum or in the femur, it must be cut away. Annandale is led to recommend early operation of the kind mentioned m cases of hip-disease in which signs of suppuration exist, by the considera- tion that the head of the femur is usually carious in these cases, and that its caily removal is likely to clicck the further progress of the disease, and to leave the patient with an useful and movable limb. In the Acetab-olar Pel-vic form of coxalgia, the idtimatc result is, I Jjclicve, inevitably fatal, if the disease be allowed to run its own course un- checked by 0])eration. Large portions of the pelvic bones in and around the acetabulum—such as the ischium, the tuber and ramus of the ischium, theDISEASE OF THE IIIP-JOINT. 326 Tamils of the pubes and the dorsum ilii—fall into a state of necrosis; that cavity becomes perforated (Pig. 4!)0); and the head of the thigh-bone, still lying in> it, becomes denuded of its cartilaginous investment, roughened and carious, as is well seen in the annexed drawing (Fig. 491), taken from a patient of mine- who died of this form of the disease ; or it may be dislocated in a carious state on to the dorsum ilii. Large abscesses, intra- as well as extra-pelvic, fonn,and the patient dies worn out by hectic ; the natural efforts of the part being entirely unavailing to separate and to eliminate such large necrosed masses, deeply lying, and covered in by the upper end of the thigh-bone. Bemoval of Diseased Acetabulum and Pelvic Bones.—Until a very recent period. Surgeons feared to undertake the removal of large carious and necrosed portions of the pelvic bones, and acetabular disease of the hip-joint was accordingly allowed to run its fatal course unchecked. Hancock was the first Surgeon who undertook the removal of large portions of these bones, and since then the operation has been done several times by others. In no case has, I believe, more extensive disease been removed with a good result than in a girl who was sent to me some years ago by my friend Mr. Tweed, and from whom I removed the upper end of the thigh-bone, the acetabidiun, the rami of the pubes and of the ischium, a portion of the tuber ischii, and part of the dorsum ilii. This patient, when admitted into the Hospital, was in the last stage of disease, exhausted by the constant discharge, and must inevitably have speedily sunk under the effects of the disease, had no effort been made to remove the cause of the prostration. At the operation, she was so exhausted that it was necessary to leave her on the operating-table for some horns before she was sufficiently restored to bear moving into bed. Nevertheless, by the free use of stimulants and nourishing food, she improved rapidly; and when she recovered the limb jiresented the appearance in the drawing (Fig. 4!):2) ; it .was straight, shortened about two inches ; good movement existed at the hi]i; and she could walk with much case. Constitutionally, she was in perfect I’ig. 4StO.—Perforation of tlie Pelvic Bones in Acetabular Coxaigia.

In three other cases I have successfully removed large portions of the acetabulum and of the contiguous portions of the ilium and ischium. In cases such as these, the result, if they are left to themselves, must inevitably be fatal. There is no danger of laying open the pelvic cavity during the remo^-al of these masses of pelvic bone ; for, as Hancock has shovm, during the progi-ess of the disease the fasciae, muscles, &c., lining the pelvis, become so thickened and infiltrated with plastic matter, that they form a barrier which effectually protects the pelvic cavity. Method of Operating.—From the preceding considerations, it will be ob- served that there are two distinct operations practised on the coxo-femoral articulation. The first is simple resection of the epiphysis of the thigh-bone ; the second, the remoA’al of more or less of the acetabulum and of the con- tiguous pelvis bones as well. For the removal of the epiphysis of the thigh- l)one only, the foUovnng plan should be pursued. The patient Hes on the sound side. If the disease be femoral, the gluteal region perforated with Fig. ‘‘92.-Rtsult of Excision for Extensive Acetabular t-oxalgia, three years after Operation. Fig. 403.—Excision in Femoral Coxalgiu.

The carious epiphysis is then cut off with a saw, the soft parts around being protected, if necessai-y, l)y means of retractors. There is one practical question with regard to the amount of the upper end of the thigh-bone to be removed, which requires consideration; and that is. Should the bone be sawn through below the great trochanter ; or through the neck only, leading the trochanter ? The practice should, I think, differ according to the natime of the disease. If this be femoral, it is best to take away the great trochanter, as the caries has generally reached its cancellous structure, or it may be infiltrated with tubercle. But if the disease be aceta- bular, and the peMc bones be the parts most extensively and deeply affected, it will suffice to remove the head only, leaving the trochanter, which is not affected in these cases. After removing the head of the bone, the upper end should be examined, and any carious parts gouged out. After the epiphysis of the thigh-bone has been removed, the acetabulum must be examined, and any rough or necrosed bone lying at its edge should be gouged away. In the acetabular form of the disease, where large portions of the pelvic bones require removal, the early stages of the operation requh-e to be con- ducted in the way just described; the incisions, however, being made more freely, but not carried so far forwards as to endanger the anterior crural, or so far back as to woimd the sciatic nerve. After the removal of the head of the thigh-bone, all loose necrosed pieces are to be taken out, and then, by means of ordinary cutting or gouge-forceps, the acetabulum and other carious osseous structm-es cut away piecemeal. Those portions of bone which have necrosed are 'irsually separated, and lying loose, or else may generally be readily separated by the finger, or by the handle of a scalpel, fi’om the sub- jacent soft structm-es; and the muscles and fascite fining the pelvic bones, being thickened and infiltrated vdth lymph, effectually protect the contained parts fr'om all injm-y. , i , After the operation the wound must be dressed m a sunplc maimer, and a lono- splint applied. Fergusson recommends that the extension should be made from the opposite thigh, round the upper part of which a socket is fixed, to which the band is attached (Fig. 494). Much advantage avi c derived fr-om the use of the bracket thigh-splint, fr-om which extension may made by means of a ivcight (as in Fig. 184, \ol.

From the beginning of the second month to the end of the year after the operation there were 27 deaths, or 15-?> ■per cent.; while nine died in the coimse of two or more years, of phthisis and other diseases. Leisrink states that in 17G cases of excision of the hip, there Avere idtogether 98 deaths. Of this apparently high mortality, however, only about one half, or 2(i per cent, of the whole cases, can be ascribed to the operation itself, or to the intercm-rence . of pyiemia and other diseases Avhich are liable to attend operative procedures. The other half of the deaths Avere produced by extension of the disease, by diarrhoea, or by phthisis or other disease of internal organs—probably in many instances existing at the time when the operation AA'^as performed. The mortality foUoAAung the operation appears to have been much loAver in England and America than in France and Oermany. The result of my own experience is, that the mortality directly referable to the operation itself is but small. I haA'e operated in twelve cases. Of these, only two have proved directly fatal; five are noAV AA^ell and going about; three J have lost sight of, after their recoA'ery and discharge from Hospital; and two haA e died, one eleven months and the other two years after the operation, from constitutional disease unconnected with it. When we consider that all these eases Avere instances of advanced femoral or acetabular coxalgia, which Avould speedily have proved fatal if not subjected to operation, Ave may with justice look upon them as successful, so far as the preseiwation of hfe was ■concerned. And, in this respect, excision of the head of the thigh-bone or of the hip-joint stands in a different position from similar operations practised on other joints. The Surgeon excises the elboAV, shoulder, or ankle, in order to restore an useful limb to the patient. Excision of these joints is a substitute for the loss of the limb by amjAutation—not, as in the case of the hip, to pi’cvcnt the almost inevitable loss of the life of the patient by continuance of hectic. 2. In estimating the 'ulililij of the Ibnb left after the excision of the hip-joiiit, Ave must compare it Avith the kind of member that Avould be left in the event of the patient surviving sufficiently long for a natural cure to result. It Avould be manifestly absurd to compare a limb Avhich had become seriously crippled, Avithered, diseased, and shortened, before any operation Avas undertaken, Avith one in Avhich no morbid action had ever taken place. So also Avould it be unjust to compare it Avith the state of a limb left after a slight attack of330 DISEASE OF THE lllP-JOINT. coxulgiti, in which operation could never ha\'e become necessary, nor have been contemplated. But, on comparing the result of operated cases with that of those which recover spontaneously, after caries and destructive disintegration of the upper epiphysis of the thigh-bone have existed for years, we shall find that the balance is by no means against those in which excision has been done. As I do not consider the operation necessary in cases of arthritic coxalgia, I do not compare the result of these cases with that of those operated on, but con- fine myself entirely to those in which there has been destructive bone-disease. In those rare cases of this description, when, after years of prolonged suffering, recovery is at last accomplished by uatinal means, the limb left is more or less completely anlcylosed at the hip, rvasted, shortened to the extent of two to four inches, jrartially flexed upon the pelvis, adducted, with the knee possibly stiffened, semiflexed, and advanced : the patient is just able to put the toes to the ground, without the power of bearing upon or rotating the limb, but, when he wishes to turn, twisting the whole pelvis by the aid of the greatly increased mobility of the lumbar spine. After successful excision, the result is much more satisfactory, as may be seen in Fig. 492. The principal abnormal appearance in the limb is its shorten- ing, to the extent usually of from two to three inches—to the extent, indeed, to which the pre-existing disorganisation and dislocation of the^ head of the bone had previously reduced it. It is well nourished, straight, firm, and admits of easy and rapid progression. The ankylosis is fibrous, not osseous. The patient is then enabled to flex the thigh on the pelvis, and to adduct it; but, just as in cases that have undergone a natural cure, the power of external rotation and of abduction is lost, the mobility of the lumbar spine compen- sating for the loss of these movements. Caries of the Great Trochaxter occasionally occurs with abscess in the npper and outer part of the thigh, at first sight closely resembling hip-disease; but a httle careftil examination with the probe and by manipidation of the limb, will soon convince the Surgeon that the joint is free from disease, and that the morbid action is limited to the trochanter, and possibly the root of the neck of the thigh-bone. In such cases the diseased osseous structures may be successfully gouged away, after having been fr'eely exposed by slitting up the sinuses leading to them. In such operations I have not only success- fully removed the greater part of the trochanter, but have even scooped out a portion of the interior of the carious neck of the thigh-bone at its trochan- teric end ; thus preventing the inevitable disorganisation of the hip-joint which would have resulted if the carious bone had been allowed to remain in close proximity to the articulation. In this operation the Sm’geon necessarily comes into very close proximity with the capsule of the joint; and unless gi-eat care be taken this may be opened, and thus the very mischief induced Avhich the operation is undertaken to prevent. In strumous children long sinuses will occasionally form about^ the p'eat trochanter and gluteal region, leading to the supposition that there is caries of the bones in the vicinity of the hip-joint. The movements ot the articulatmn will, however, be foimd to be perfectly free, and the most careful examination with the probe fails to detect osseous disease. _ Amputation in Cases of Disease of the Hip Joint. The question o331 ANKYLOSIS OF THE JIIF-JOIXT. uuiputation in cases of disease of the hip-joint is one that must often hare presented itself to the Surgeon when he has contemplated the shortened, Avasted, and deformed member that is frequently left in the more advanced form of the disease, and which can never be rendered useful as a basis of support to the body by any mechanical contrivance however skilfully designed, but must always remain not only an useless but a cumbrous, appendage. It appeal’s to me that in the more adA’anced chronic cases of hip-joint disease, this operation is justifiable, and, indeed, is to be advocated in certain circiunstances. These are as folloAV. 1. In cases Avhere the disease is confined to the head of the femur, or AA'here, if any portion of the peh’ic bones be attacked, it be to so hmited an extent as. to be readily removable by the gouge, excision Avould necessarily be the usual practice. But if the patient’s health be too Ioav or iiTitable to bear this, or if the limb be so shortened, atrophied, and deformed by long disuse as to be incapable of furnishing proper support to the patient, then amputation at the hip-joint would, I think, be a proper procediu’e. I do not think that the mere destruction of the cartilaginous lining of the acetabidum should mihtate against the perfomiance of the operation ; for we constantly see in hip-joint disease Avhen the head of the bone has been dislocated, or after amputation at the hip-joint for accident or ordinary disease, that the acetabulum fills up AAuth a dense fibroid mass after the destruction or removal of its cartilage. But, if the pelvic bones be so far diseased that the necrosed or carious part does not admit of removal, then necessarily amputation Avould not be justifiable. 2. When the diseased action involves the shaft of the femur, which may be necrosed, or thinned and atrophied to such an extent and degree as not ta leaA'e a sound hmb after removal of the upper epiphysis, amputation Avonld be- proper. ^ 3. Amputation would be justifiable after excision has been tried and has failed in securing an useful result to the patient, the limb being left shorty weak, loose, and oedematous. ANKATLOSIS OF THE HIP-JOINT. Anhjlom of the Hq)-Joint, following its inflammation, diflPers in its degree o completeness and in the position of the limb. Thus, it may be fibrous or osseous ; or the hmb m either of these cases may be straight, or more or less ncxed on the abdomen and adducted. ‘'iP these cases is the direction of the. liml). If biif Hffl! the trunk coiTespond, bone i! required, or indeed possible.

Itj unfortunately, the limb have become ankylosed in the flexed or angular position, means must be adopted to straighten it ; and this must be done whether the ankylosis be fibrous and incomplete, or osseous and complete, ' For here the deformity and inutility of the limb are always considerable ; and increasingly so, the more the ankylosis approaches to a right angle. In rectangular ankylosis of the hip, the foot cannot be put to the ground so long as the spine is straight (Fig. 495). In order that the toe should touch the ground, it be- comes necessary that the body be bent forward ; and the lumbar spine will con- sequently be thrown into a very considerable arch with the convexity forwards (Fig. 496). The extent of the angular’ deformity in this kind of ankylosis can always be easily measured in the fol- lorving way. If the patient be laid flat upon his back, so that the lumbar spine touches the mattress on Fig. 495.—Ankylosis after Ilip- .joint Diseiiso: Angular Flexion of Limb on Pehus. which he is lying, the knee Fig. 490.—-Uikylosis after Hip- joint Disease : CiUTature of Spine in plaeing Foot on Ground. will be raised above that of the sound limb, and the angle formed between the thigh and trunk will be at once very perceptible. But if the knee be depressed so as to be brought to the same level as that of the sound limb, then the anterior supei-ior space of the ilium is rotated forwards, and the lumbar spine arched forwards to an extent proportionate to the angle of deformity. This angular ankylosis of the hip-joint requires to be corrected, and the limb to be brought into a straight position, so that, even if it be shortened, the patient may, by means of a high-heeled boot, rest it upon the groimd, and use it as a means of support and of progression. This may usually be ettected without much difficulty, when the ankylosis is fibrous, by forcible extension under chloroform, the limb being thus often brought straight at once withou nuy material difficulty. But in other cases this cannot be done by simple extension, resistance being ottered by the muscles on the anterior and upp part of the thigh. In such circimistances, those that olfer most resistanceOPElxATIOX FOR ANGULAR ANKYLORIR. 333 must be di\ idecl subcutaneously ; and these will usually be found to be the rectus, tensor vai^inai femoris, pectincus, and gracilis. After the limb has, in this way, been straightened, and maintained for some time in the straight position* by means of the long splint or weight apparatus (Fig. 184), means may be adopted by passive motion and frictions to restore the mobility of the joint. Operation for Osseous Angular Ankylosis.—When osseous ankylosis of the hip has occmred in the angular position, the case necessarily becomes much more serious ; and the rectification of the position of the limb, and the resto- ration of its mobility, can only be effected by surgical operation. The operation l)y which these objects are accomplished consists in the divi- sion of the Upper Part of the Femur ; through its neck, if any remains of that structure still exist, or, at all events, above the trochanter minor. The first operation of the kind was performed by Rhea Barton, in 182G. It was done in the case of a sailor, 21 years ago, Avho, in consequence of an injury, had an osseous ankylosis of the hip in a nearly rectangular position. Barton, according to Gross, made a crucial incision over and down to the great trochanter. The muscles were detached and turned aside, and the bone sawn through, the great trochanter and part of the neck of the femur having been divided transversely. Whether a simple section of the bone was made, or, in conformity nrth Barton’s usual practice in ankylosis, a v-shaped piece of bone was removed, I know not, for on this point American authonties differ. But the limb was brought into a straight position, and put up in a fractiu’e-appa- ratus for twenty days. At the end of this time, passive motion was com- menced, and at the end of four months the patient had a movable false joint, so that he could rotate the limb, abduct it for twenty inches, and carry it backwards and forwards to a still greater extent. The case.was therefore eminently successful. The operation appears, however, to have attracted but little notice, and to have been but rarely followed by others. It is true that Barton himself operated a second time ; and that Rodgers of New York, in 1830,^ did so successfully on a man 47 years old. The example of these American Siu-geons was followed in Europe, by Textor in 1841, and by Maisonneuve in 1847, on a girl of 18, successfully. Ross (U. S. A.) operated in 1857, on a woman of 23. In the two latter cases no false joint was made ; but the bone, after being straightened, united again by callus. In 1 larch, 1869, I performed a similar operation at University College Hospital, on a girl of IG, who had rectangular osseous ankylosis of the right hip-joint' ibo patient made a slow but a good recovery with a straight and usefuriimb rsllZ^ T!?

The seetion of the bone is effected after its exposure, by means of the chain saw; the transverse section being first made, the convex one next (Fig. 498). W. Adams has deAused a much more simple opera- tion, haAdng in view the same objects. His plan is to divide mbcuiamously the neck of the thigh-bone about its centre. This idea he put in praetiee in De- cember, 1869, when he performed the first subcutaneous ;section of the neck of the femur for the relief of deformity resulting from •ansular ankylosis. This operation is done as follows. The tenotome having been introduced a little above the top of the great trochanter, is carried S'ig. 407.—Lines of Section in , Sayre’s Operation for Anky- “ iosis of Hip-joint. Fig. 49S.

The knife being withdraAvn, a saw of this size (Fig._499), set in a strong anguhu- handle, is passed down to the bone, Avhich is cut thi’ough from before backwards (Fig. 500). The section of the bone takes a few Suites, and is as much an act of filing as of sawing. The Avound is then closed by a pad, and the limb brought straight.

Maunder prefers a chisel to the saw in practising subcutaneous osteotomy of the neck of the femur, and has had much success in the operation so performed. On comparing this operation with those which had preceded it, by Barton, Sayre, and others, there can be no doubt of its superior simplicity and safety ; and although it is perhaps less likely to be followed by mobility of limb than when a piece of bone is cut out by Sayi'e’s method, yet it must be admitted that not only is a movable false joint of doubtful utility, but it seems to have been very difficult of establishment, so great is the tendency to bony ankylosis after these sections.336 DISEASES OF SYNOVIAL MEMBRANES, AND OF AWSCLES. CHAPTER LIIL DISEASES OF SYNOVIAL MEMBEANES, AND OF MUSCLES. DISEASES OF BURS.®. The bnrs£e whicli naturally exist, either under the skin, beneath the muscles and hgaments, or around tendons, are subject to various diseases. Not only do the normal bursse become aflPected, but these sacs are sometimes developed from continued friction in situations where they are not naturally met with, and here also they may undergo disease ; thus, for instance, bm'ste have been found to be formed at the projecting point of a hump-back, on the prominent parts of club-feet, or at the extremity of stumps. Situations in which Bursse exist.—In the following situations burseo naturally occur, and may consequently be expected to be met vdth in a diseased state :—behind the angle of the lower jaw, on the symphysis of the chin, on the angle of the thyroid cartilage ; on the acromion, the external and internal condyles of the humerus, the olecranon, the styloid processes of the ulna and radius ; on the dorsal surface of the metacarpo-phalangeal articula- tions, as well as on their palmar surface, and on the dorsal aspect of the phalangeal articulations ; on the anterior superior spine of the ihum, the great trochanter, the tuberosity of the ischium, the lower, superior, and outer parts of the patella ; on each condyle of the thigh-bone, the tuberosity of the tibia, the two malleoli, the calcaneiun, the dorsal aspect of the toes, and on the ' Fig. 501.—Enlarged Bursa over Olecranon—Miner’s Elbow, thickened, Or to Undergo Vai’ioUS changes in structure. This en- largement of the bursie in particular situations is often connected with special employments, by which continuous and severe pressure is exercised upon ceitain plantar aspect of the heads of the first and fifth metatarsal bones. Besides these situations, they occur imder the deltoid and the gluteus maximus, between the lower end of the scapula and the latissimus dorsi, and in the ham.

The four follo\nng pathological conditions may occur in the bursee in any part of the body. 1. The bursa may, in consequence of continued pressure or iiTitation, become simply enlarged and filled by the excessive secretion of a clear sero- syno'^ial straw-coloured fluid. 2. Inflammation may take place in the bursa with or Avithout previous enlargement. The inflammation so set up speedily runs on to suppui-ation ; and Avhen the tumom- is opened, fluid, consisting of an admixture of the bursal secretion and pus, escapes. The bursa, Avhen its contents have suppurated, may either give way externally, pointing like an ordinary abscess, and the integuments covering it sloughing ; or the pus may escape subcutaneously, and fonn a vridely spread abscess around the part. 3. The enlarged bm’sa may contain a dark fluid, usually of a broAvnish colour, Avith a large niunber of small flattened elongated bodies, of about the size of gi'ains of rice or of melon-seeds, floating in it. These bodies are of a fibroid or fibro-plastic structure, resembling masses of imperfectly developed exuda- tion-cells, and are apparently portions of disintegrated lymph. 4. The AvaUs of the bimsa may gradually thicken by the deposit of loAvly organised lymph in its interior, until the tumour becomes perfectly solid, or at most contains but a small cavity Avith a little serous fluid in its centre. The section of a bursa thus solidified presents a laminated or foliated appear- ance. Enlarged bursm are readily recognised; forming, whilst their contents are thin and serous, indolent oval tumom-s with distinct fluctuation, commonly occiuring in the situation of some of the normal bursm. As they become more sohd they become elastic and hard, and often crackle on being pressed when they contain the rice-shaped bodies ; but at last they acquire aU the characters of an ordinary solid growth, as the deposition Avithin them increases. ^ Not unfrequently these enlarged burs® inflame ; or, indeed, an. attack of inflammation in them may be the first cause of their enlargement. In either case they become hot and tense ; the skin covering them is red, often c^oughy and cedematous ; and although there is no connection between the- Dursa and the neighboimng joint, yet it may happen that the inflammatory continuity of tissue.

If suppuration take place, they must he freely opened and the pus evacuated. AVhen they are in an indolent condition, the Surgeon has the choice of various plans of treatment, conducted on different principles.' If the sac he thin, the fluid of a serous character, and the disease recent, it may often he removed by blistering, more particiflarly -when it occurs in the ham or under the deltoid muscle. In some cases it may conveniently be obliterated by puncturing the cyst, and then employing pressure upon it. The surest mode, however, of closing the sac consists in exciting inflammation in it, either by the injection of iodine as recommended by Velpeau, or by passing a small seton through it. The injection is readily effected by tapping the cyst with a moderate sized trocar, and then throwing in about a drachm of the compound tinctme. Inflammation will be excited, some discharge will usually take place, and on its cessation the walls of the cyst wiU have become agglutinated together. In these cases I generally prefer, however, as the most certain method, the introduction of a seton composed of a double silk thread. This may con- veniently be passed through the cannula after tapping the sac, in the way flgured in page 153, Vol. I. (Fig. 77) ; a poultice should afterwards be apphed, and the threads left in for about six days. Discharge will take place through the aperture by which they have been introduced, and which may, if necessary, be enlarged ; the cyst gradually contracts around them, and after their removal it ■will be found to be closed. When the cyst contains a number of the rice-like bodies, the seton may still be used, but it should be thicker than that just recommended, and the aperture by which it is introduced should be very free, in order to allow the escape of the pus and granules. If the walls of the cyst be very thick, or its contents semi-solid, or if the tumour have become sohd, it must be dissected out. This operation is most commonly required for solid binsal tumoms, situated over the patella or the tuberosities of the ischium ; from both of these situations they may be removed with facility. Diseases oe the Bursa Patellhs.—The exposed situation of the binsa patelte, covered as it is only by the integumental structures and fascia lata, and its liability to pressure and irritation in kneeling, render it in all respects more prone to take on diseased action than any other similar structme in the human body ; and the morbid conditions which it presents may be looked upon as typical to a great extent of the diseases of the binsae generally. The various affections to which the binsa is liable, may be di'vided into two classes : 1. Inflammatory Affections ; and 2. Enlargements, of a Fluid or of a Sohd character. 1. Inflammatory Affections.—This bursa is frequently the_ seat ot Simple Difiammation. Undue pressine in kneehng upon a hard, iiTegular, and cold sinface, such as stone, is likely to excite inflammation : hence its frequency in housemaids, whose occupation obliges them to kneel a great deal on floors and stone steps ; and hence, also, the common title of “housemaid s knee,” given to this and to many other affections of this bursa. But this disease, although fi’equent amongst housemaids, is not limited to them ; for it occurs in females following other occupations, and in men as well as in v omen. In simple inflammation, however occasioned, the bursa becomes rather sud- denly swollen, tense, red, and hot, with some fluctuation deeply uiic ei le339 DISEASE OF THE PATELLA. integuments. The swelling, heat, fluctuation, and redness of a dusky colour, all situated in front of the patella, point out the nature of the The Treatment of this inflammation is simple enough. Leeches, followed hy evaporating lotions, and keeping the patient at rest, are the means to be emnloved Under this treatment, the disease will frequently undergo resolu- tion in the course of a few days. It may, however, go on to suppuration, disease of the patella itself, or sloughing of the bursa. _ Suppuration of the Bursa occurs in perhaps the majority of cases ot inflam- mation This is a matter of great consequence ; because the accumulation ot pus bcino- of large size, and tending to diffuse itself around the knee-joint, is liable to*^be mistaken for abscess in that articulation. Sometimes it will point, and the pus discharge itself externally in the usual manner ; but very generally it gives way subcutaneously, and its contents speedily diffuse them- selves somewhat widely around the joint beneath the fascia lata. The history of the case affords the means of diagnosis. In suppuration ot the buraa patellie, the abscess commences by a superficial swelling and inflam- mation in front of the knee, which, after a time, extends laterally, enveloping the joint, the fluid gra^dtating on each side, but more especially on the outei one, nearly as far, perhaps, as the ham-strings. There will have been none of the signs indicative of acute arthritis accompanying the formation of this large abscess ; no startings of the limb, no laxity or pain in moving the articulation, no grating of the articular ends ; and little if any constitutional disturbance. The movements of flexion and extension of the joint are free up to a certain point, where they are checked by the mechanical obstacle of the purulent accumulation. But perhaps the most important diagnostic sign is the relation of the abscess to the patella. In a suppmating bursa, the patella is imisible, being covered by the fluctuating swelling ; in effusion, whether •synovial or piu’ulent, into the joint, the patella is above, floating upon the fluid. The Treatment of this condition is simple enough. A free iucision should be made through the anterior part of the biu’sa, so as to let out the pus mixed with synovial fluid ; and if there be any biuTovung of matter, as there almost invariably is, comiter-openings must be made in proper dependent situations. Disease of the Patella.—Sometimes, but very rarely, abscess of the bursa patellee will give rise to disease of the patella itself. Caries of this bone secondary to suppiuation of the bursa, is, so far as my experience goes, exceedingly rare. I have seen one case of the kind—that of a woman Avho was in the Hospital, under my care, several years ago. '\^^len admitted, she had seA^eral fistulous •openings on the fore part of the knee-joint, through which the probe led down to a rough and carious patella. On inquiry it was ascertained that she had had inflammation of the bursa patellm—“ housemaid’s knee ”—which had run on to suppuration, but that the abscess had never been freely laid open. The present condition had resulted from that suppuration. The joint itself was unaffected ; there was no pain in it, and its movements were perfectly free. I laid open the sinuses, and, finding the anterior surface of the patella soft and ■carious, removed with the gouge the diseased bone to which they led. About two or three weeks after this, the joint became suddenly swollen, evidently filled with pus, and the seat of acute pain. In consequence of the severity of340 DISEASES OF SYNOVIAL MEMBRANES, AND OF MUSCLES. the symptoms, it became necessary to remove the limb above the knee. After amputation, it was found that the morbid action had extended through the patellar cartilage, perforating it by a small aperture, and so giving rise to sup- puration within the joint. Sloughing of the Bursa Patellae occasionally occurs as the result of its inflammation and suppuration, A woman was admitted into the Hospital, in whom this bursa had inflamed and suppurated ; and not only the bursa but also the integimients covering it had sloughed away, leaving in front of the knee a circular ulcer as large as the palm of the hand, having a flabby sur- face, and undermined, purple edges. The patella was not exposed. Under ordinary treatment, the ulcer slowly healed, but no vestige of bursa was left. 2. Enlargements.—We now proceed to the consideration of the second variety of disease of the bursa patellfe—that in Avhich there is no inflammation, but in which there is enlargement of the biusa, owing to the accumulation Avithin it of bursal fluid, of this fluid mixed Avith solid bodies, or of solid fibroid deposits. Simple Enlargement.—The bursa may present a simple enlargement, de- pendent on the accumulation of fluid in its interior. Continued pressure exer- cised upon the bursa, as in kneeling, is the common cause of this affection ; hence it frequently occius amongst housemaids, and constitutes the true “house- maid’s knee.” But it is also common amongst other people, AA^hose vocation necessitates long-continued kneeling. One case of the affection in University College Hospital was in a cai’pet-layer ; it AA^as to all intents and purposes a “housemaid’s knee.” A man, aged thirty, who, in consequence of habitually kiAeeling upon the left knee in laying doAAui carpets, had a tmnour there as large as an orange, indolent, soft, and fluctuating to the feel, evidently an enlarged bursa, was admitted into the Hospital. It was tapped by means of a trocar, clear fluid was di'awn off, and a seton Avas passed through the cannula, and left in for six or seven days. Suppuration took place along the seton, the tumour collapsed and contracted, and the patient left the Hospital, cured, on the tAvelfth day. With regard to the Pathological Nature of the disease, it would seem to con- sist in excessHe secretion into the interior of the bursa, Avhich becomes enlarged, thickened, and filled Avith a clear sero-synovial fluid. The Treatment of these tumours is very simple. In some cases the aiAplica- tion of tincture of iodine, or the ammoniacum and mercury plaster, or bfister- ing, AviU succeed in inducing absorption of the contained fluid. If these fail, as they very often do, or if their use be too tedious, a very simple, and at the same time a very safe and successful, mode of treatment consists in tapping the tumour with the trocar, and passing a seton through the cannula, either by means of a long straight needle, or by using an eyed probe, and cutting down upon the end of it Avith a scalpel. The seton-threads should be left in until they excite free suppuration, and then be withdiwii. This treatment is ex- ceedingly simple, and perfectly certain in its results. The only point to be attended to is, to keep the apertures by Avhich the seton passes sufficient!} patent to allow the free eseape of any fluid Avhich may collect in the intcrioi of the bursa before it is elosed. This is especially to be observed with the loAVcr opening, Avhich is apt to become blocked up.BUN I ox. 341 Chronic Enlargement.—n\c next affection to which the bursa patelhc is liable is closely allied to the last, and appears to be an advanced degi-ee of ]t. It consists in a chronic enlargement of the bursa, the coats of which are much thickened. The contents of the bursa, so enlarged, consist of a dark fluid, in which float a number of smooth oval bodies, of the size and shape of melon- seeds. I have seen this condition in both the ruale and the female. It may be distinguished from simple enlargement of the bursa, by the pecifliar crackling sensation which is communicated to the hand when the tumour is manipulated. This arises fr'om the melon-seed bodies floating about and rubbing against each other. The Paihologg of this aff'ection is as follows. There is enlargement of the biii-sa, with excessive secretion into its interior of simple synovial fluid ; this, however, is dark-coloured, probably from admixtime of blood which has under- gone disintegi'ation. This fluid will be found to contain a large quantity of cholesterine, broken-up blood-corpuscles, and granules. The melon-seed bodies ai’e composed of lowly organised fibroid matter mixed with cholesterine, and ai’e probably separated fr’om the wall of the biu’sa. Solid Tumours may be formed in connection with the bursa pateUm. By many these are supposed to be the result of a deposition of a fibroid material, which gTadiially takes the place of the fluid of an ordinary “housemaid’s knee,” and which, instead of taking the form of melon-seed bodies, is deposited in concentric masses, and thus accumulated in the interior of the cyst. This has not been the case, however, in many instances that I have seen. In these cases I believe there is a true fibroid deposit in the bursa from the very first ; the tumom is never fluid, but hard and solid fr’om the commencement, and continues slowly to augment in size, until it occasions sufficient inconvenience to require removal. In some cases there has been a previous syphilitic taint; the patient complains of pain in the tumour like that which is experi- enced in nodes, and it is by no means impossible that there may be a syj)hilitic origin for these tumours. However that may be, in the cases that have fallen under my observation, the tumours have never been fluid, nor have they origi- nated in pressme, but appear to have been primary deposits of fibroid matter. Ireatment. There is nothing to be done with such tumours but to dissect them out. This may be required in one or in both knees. With the most ordinaiy care the joint runs but little risk • but much trouble may arise from opening up that layer of deep fascia which, after siUTOuuding the knee, is fixed to the borders of the patella. Such an accident is liable to be followed by in tiation and deep abscess in the ham, and is to be avoided by keeping the scalpel weU towards the centre of the patella when operating. uxiox. A\hen the bursa which lies towards the plantar siuface of the leac 0 t e metatarsal hone of the great toe becomes enlarged, or Avhen a neiv serous sac is formed upon the inner and posterior aspect of this bone, the aisease termed a lunion occurs. In this affection, the enlargement of the bursa IS usually secondary to an alteration in the shape and position of the Sri.oor’ I consequence of the pressure of narrow-pointed boots, has Ijeen throvm outwards in an oblique direction, so as to lie over or ™fo.™7V tW a sharp angle ioimcd at the junction between the first phalanx and the metatarsal342 DISEASES OF SYNOVIAL MEMBRANES, AND OF MUSCLES. bone of the great toe. This angle, being constantly pressed upon by the boot, becomes instated; and, for its protection, the bursa that is there natmally situated becomes enlarged, or an adventitious one forms. From time to tune the bursa and the projecting angle become irritated and in- flamed ; and the morbid action thus set up may run on to suppuration of a very troublesome kind, a thin, unhealthy pus’ being formed, which is dis- charged through an opening that speedily becomes fistulous, and may degenerate into a most troublesome indolent sore. Treatment.—In the treatment of this affection, the first thing to be done is to change the direction of the toe by wearing properly shaped boots, made with the inner side of the sole straight from the toe to the heel. If accidental inflammation be excited in the part, it must be allayed by the application of leeches, warm foot-baths, and poulticing ; the cutaneous irritation that is left may best be removed by painting the surface with a strong solution of nitrate of silver. The faulty direction of the toe may best be remedied by using the iimenious contrivance (Fig. 503), the action of which consists in dramng the everted end of the toe inwards by the constant action of a slender steel spring. Should these means fail, the position of the toe may be remedied by the divi- sion of the external lateral hgament of the metatarso-phalangeal articifiation, or of the tendon of the adductor polheis, or of the mner^ head ot the flexor breads pollicis ; the toe, when restored to its position, being for a time kep fixed upon an under-splint. Occasionally in elderly people the bunion wil inflame and suppurate, and the mischief, extending to the metatarso-phalangea articulation, will cause dftorganisation of this. This is a state devoid of anxiety, as it not unfrequently happens that, if the constitutional powers be enfeebled by age, a low sloughy ^^TSfl^elatoiis inflam^ set up in the foot, which eventually may terminate fatally be in-etrievably disorganised, and the patient’s strength admit it, amputation through the metatarsal bone should be done.343 GANGLION. DISEASES OF SHEATHS OP TENDONS, The Synovial sacs connected with the sheaths of tendons are hable to two forms of disease : viz., the accumulating of the fluid in the interior of the sac, forming a cystic swelling, known by the name of Ganglion ; and acute and chronic° Inflammation, or Tenosynovitis. The tendons of the hand are most liable to both these affections. c- 7 G vis'G LION.—Two distinct kinds of ganglion are met with: the Limple, situated upon the sheaths of tendons; and the Compound, consisting in a dilatation of the sheath itself. Simple Ganglion consists of a cyst varying in size from a cheiTy-stone to- a large marble, and containing a clear transparent fluid of a yeUowish colour, which is sometimes thin and serous, sometimes gelatinous and semi-coagulated. It occurs as a smooth, globular, elastic, and tense tumoim, usuaUy situated on the back of the wrist, where it forms a distinct round projection ; it may also occiu’ on the dorsum of the foot. In both situations it is distinctly connected vdth. the sheaths of the extensor tendons ; and, indeed, Paget looks upon it as being a cystic transformation of the cells enclosed in the Mnge-like processes of synovial membrane lining these sheaths. As ganghon increases in size, it often gives rise to painfid sensations in the parts below it, by pressing upon the neighbouring nerves ; thus, a ganghon at the back of the wrist often produces pain and weakness in the hand, by compressing some of the branches of the musculo-spiral nerve which are stretched over it. Ganglion is by far the most common of aU the tumours that occur on the hand. In all cases of oval or rounded, smooth, elastic tumour on the hand or fingers, whether painless or neuralgic, the flrst point to determine is whether it be ganglion or not; but ganglion should always be suspected. Compound Ganglion is chiefly met with in the pahn of the hand, and the dorsum, sole, or inner side of the foot. It consists of a dilatation of the sheaths of the tendons in these situations : it may often attain a very considerable bulk, and then usually becomes irregular in shape, owing to several tendons being implicated by it. Often, in this form of ganglion, the sheath is thickened as well as dilated; and the contained fluid is clear and yellowish, though usually thinner than in the simple ganghon. The sheath itself is vascular, and lined by a red, fringed, and velvety membrane ; the fluid may then be dark and bloody, and contain masses of buff-coloured flbrine or a large number of gi-anular bodies, like those met -with in certain forms of enlarged bm’ste. These I have found to be composed of imperfectly developed granulations, in which the re- mains of blood-vessels were visible, probably thrown off’ from the inner wall of the vascular sheath. This form of the disease, at times, puts on almost a malignant appearance, is extremely chronic, and may occupy a very extensive siu’facc ; in a case that was under my care some time ago, the dorsum and gi’cater part of the inner side of the foot were involved. Ireatment.—The treatment of a ganglion must depend upon its character and size. 'When small and simple, as on the back of the wrist, it may commonly be got rid of by being ruptured by forcible pressure with the thumb, or by a blow with the back of a book, or by being tightly compressed, by means of a coin wrapped up in a piece of lint and firmly strapped upon the swelling. If it do not disappear in this way, the best plan is to puncture it subcutaneously344 DISEASES OF SYNOVIAL MEMBRANES, AND OF MUSCLES. by means of a valvular opening, to squeeze out its eontents, scarify the interior of the cyst, and employ pressm-e. If the ganglion give rise to much pain and weakness, and cannot be made to disappear by the use of the means just in- dicated, it may usually be very conveniently and safely obliterated by passing a seton of two threads through it, and leaving it in for four or five days, until sufficient inflammatory action has been induced for the obliteration of the cyst. Should these means fail, it may be dissected out, if it be thought advisable to have recourse to this somewhat severe procedure, which is attended with some risk of inflammation extending up the sheath of the tendon. I have, however, on several occasions performed this operation, without any troublesome conse- quences ensuing. A Ganglion situated in the Palm of the Hand, and extending under the annular ligament some little distance up the flexor tendons of the forearm, is a very troublesome disease. Syme recommends that the cyst should be laid open, and the annular hgament divided. This seems to me an unnecessarily severe procedure ; and I have in several instances cm-ed the affection by milder means ; in one, by injecting a small quantity of tinctiu’e of iodine into the cyst through a puncture in the palm, and in two or three other cases by the use of the seton. The seton is most easily introduced by squeezing the fluid from the palm into the sheaths of the flexor tendons above the wrist, making a punctm-e into these, and then pushing an eyed probe armed with two or three threads along the tendons imder the annular Ligament into the centre of the pahn, where it is to be dranm out through a small incision made down upon it. In the Side and Sole of the Foot these ganglionic tumours, when of large size, and filled ndth semi-solid fibrinous matter, may require to be dissected out. Inflammation of the Sheaths of Tendons—Tenosynovitis.—This is occasionally met with as the result of strains and twists of the hand, about the wrist, of the extensor tendons, or the long head of the biceps. In this affection there is swelling of a puffy character, with tenderness when the part is pressed on or moved ; and usually a peculiar fine crackling sensation is commumcated to the Surgeon’s hand when he examines the affected part. The crackhng is especially marked in cases in which the inflammation and effusion have become chronic, when the disease appears to partake of the nature of a diffused gan- glion. Treatment.—The treatment, when the disease is acute, consists in leeching and blistering, with rest of the part; when it has assumed a chronic character, the application of blisters and the meremy and ammoniacum plaster will be found most useful. DISEASES OP MUSCLES. The voluntary muscles are not often the seat of primary disease of any kind. Inflammatory aflections of a rheumatic character undoubtedly occur in muscles, and abscess is occasionally met with inside muscular sheaths, more particulaily that of the rectus abdominis. Sypldhtic tumours, or rather inflammatoiy oi plastic indurations of muscles, are not very unfr’equently met with. Tumoues of Muscle.—Organic structiu’al diseases of muscular tissue are rare; yet the records of surgery contain scattered through them no incon- siderable number of cases. Teevan, has, with much industry, collected tie particulars of G2 cases of tumours of muscles of all kinds. About one-thii o345 TUMOURS OF MUSCLE. these ai-e said to have been cancerous IG were “fibrous;” 8 cystic; 5 hydatid ; and 5 erectile. In all probabilitj'-, a more advanced pathology would liave shown that many of the so-called cancerous and fibrous tumours were in reality sarcomata of various kinds. The form of cancer that occurs primarily in muscles is, I believe, invariably the encephaloid. I have most frequently seen the muscles of the lower extremity the seat of primary malignant disease. When the upper limbs arc affected, the muscles that have, according to Teevan, been most frequently attacked are the pectoralis major, deltoid, and biceps. The muscles of the trunk and neck are seldom diseased, Avith the exception of the rectus abdominis, Avhich appears to be very liable to tumours. Of twelve consecutive cases that I have had under my care in which timiours of different kinds dcA'eloped primarily in muscular tissue, the foUoving are the pai-ticulars.

After growing slowly for about six years, it had attained the size of a child’s head, when I removed it, together with seven or eight inches of the muscle from the inside of the sheath of which it had originated, and with which it was closely incoqDorated. The sheath of the femoral vessels, which was exposed for a considerable extent, was unaffected by the disease. RccuiTence took place in less than twelve months in the cicatrix, and Avhen the secondary tnmoiu’ had attained the size of an ostrich’s egg, it was removed, the patient making a good recovery ; but the disease again returned, and eventually proved fatal. The fourth case was that of a man aged about forty, in the sole of whose foot a cystic tumour, about as large as a goose’s egg, was developed, springing from the flexor brevis digitorum. This was carefully dissected out; but in a few months the patient returned, with a sohd, elastic, rapidly growing tumoiu*, evidently malignant, developed in the cicatrix (Fig. 507) . The foot was amputated, and on dissection the mass proved to be ence- phaloid, and to have developed from the muscular structm-e just named (Fig, 508) . Pig. 507.—Malignant Tumour in Sole. Fig. 50S.—Section of Foot showing situation of Timiour. Ill three cases the tumours were hydatid. In one patient, a young woman, the disease was seated in the deltoid; in the other, a medical man, about 50 years of age, the tumour was seated at the outer edge of the latissimiis dorsi; and the tMrd was a gentleman about 60 years old, in whose biceps the disease commenced. In each of these cases, excision of the tumoiu' was successfully practised. In the eighth case, the tumour was an enchondroma in the tibialis anticus.347 TREATMENT OF MUSCULAR TUMOURS. I have seen two other cases of cnchondi’oma in muscles : one situated in the vastus extemus of the thigh ; the other in coimectiou with the pectoral muscle. The ninth case was a sarcoma of the rectus femoris in a man aged 21, which I excised ; the tenth, a cancerous growtli in the anterior abdominal wall in an elderly gentleman ; the eleventh, an encephaloid tumour of the muscles of the calf in a middle-aged lady, for which amputation was practised ; and the twelfth, a sarcoma of the fore-ai’m in a lad. Tumom-s developing primarily in the intermuscular areolar planes are of very common occurrence ; but these are very different from, and must not be confounded with, true tumours of muscle. The Treatment of these various muscular tumom-s must be considered on ordinai-y surgical principles. When of an innocent character, as cystic or hydatid, fibrous, erectile, or enchondromatous, they may be dissected out from the muscular tissue amongst which they he, and no fear of recm-rence need be entertained. When they are mahgnaut, amputation of the limb, if the tumour be favour- ably situated for such an operation, is generally the only resource : partial operations are imally worse than useless, as they lead to a speedy recurrence of the malignant action. Teevan has made the ingenious suggestion of applying to malignant tiunoins of muscle the same rule of practice that guides us in operations on bones affected by cancer ; viz., to remove the whole of the organ that is the seat of disease, excising the entire muscle from its origin to its insertion, and thus eliminating fi-om the system the whole of the morbid mass, which wih be confined within its sheath—a structure that for a long time resists the outward pressure of a morbid gTowth. This suggestion is foimded on con-ect pathological principles ; the only objection to it is its difficulty of application in actual practice—there being few muscles so situated that they could with safety be completely extirpated.DEFORMITIES. 348 CHAPTER LIV. —•— DEFORMITIES. LATERAL CURVATURE OF THE SPINE. This affection, on account of the frequency of its occun-ence and the teclious- ness of its cure, has received a good deal of attention ffoni various Surgeons ; and much has been written on it by those who have specially devoted them- selves to its treatment; yet the whole of its pathology and management he in a very narrow compass. Lateral cmwature of the spine most commonly commences at an early period of life, usually between the ages of twelve and eighteen—seldom before the one, and not very com- monly after the other. Girls are more frequently the subjects of this deformity, which but rai’ely oc- curs in boys. It appears to consist simply in a re- laxation of the muscles and ligaments of the spine; in consequence of which the vertebral column, being no longer able to support the weight of the Fig. 510.—Outline of DouWe Lateral Cui'vature. Fig. 511.—Qu.ailmiilo Curve. Fig. 500.—Lateral Cun'aturc and Rotatio)! of Si>ino. head, neck, and shoulders, becomes curved to one side, a corresponding deviation taking place in the opposite direction at a lower portion ot the spine, in order to preserve the equilibrium between the two sides of the body (Figs. 500, 510). The first curve usually takes place in the upper or349 MECHANISM OF LATERAL CURVATURE. middle dorsal region, the convexity tending towards the right side ; the second, or compensating curve, occurs in the lumbar region, the convexity lookino- towards the left. In some instances there is a quadruple curve (Fi"’. 511). At the same time that these lateral curves take place, there is a tendency to rotation of the bones of the spine upon one another, in such a way that the bodies of the vertebra3 forming the dorsal curve are twisted slio-htly to the right, while those which enter into the foimation of the lumbar curve are turned slightly to the left (Fig. 510). This twist is some- times slight; but in other instances it is very marked, so that there is a double displacement—lateral and rotatory. On examining the bones and intervertebral fibro-cartilages after death, even in cases of very considerable distortion, no disease will appear in them; except, perhaps, that the bodies of some may have been slightly compressed where they form the jDrincipal concavity of the arch. The ligaments appear to be stretched, relaxed, and somewhat weakened ; and the muscles are usually pale, flabby, and apparently wanting in power. MECHAJsnsn.—From a consideration of the pathology of this affection, and from the particular age at which it manifests itself, before the bones have become completely ossified, or the ligaments have acquired their due degTee of rigidity, its mechanism becomes sufficiently apparent. The spinal column, being composed of a number of separate bones, possesses no firmness in itself, or power of self-support, but is maintained in the erect position by the close manner in which its separate elements are knit together by ligamentous and muscular stnictures, and by the way in which, when thus bound together as a whole, it is supjDorted on each side by the strong mass of the erector spinte muscles and their prolongations. The proper tension of these ligamentous supports and muscular masses is especially necessary for it to maintain the weight of the head and shoulders, which is thrown on the cervical and the upper portion of the dorsal spine. If, from any cause, the ligaments become relaxed, and the muscles lose their tension, or if the weight of the upper part of the body increase disproportionately to the augmentation in the strength of the ligaments and muscles that support the spine, the vertebral column will ne- cessarily give way under the pressure to which it is subjected in a direct line from above down- wards, and will consequently become curved. Most commonly, indeed almost invariably, this takes place in a lateral direction, the spine yielding more readily in this than in any other. In some rare cases, however, the lower portion of the cervical or the upper dorsal region will project backwards in an angular manner, constituting the disease teimed Cyphosis (Fig. 512); and in other cases, of still less frequent occurrence, there may be incun'ation of the spine in the dorso-hmibar reo-ion giving rise to Lordosis (Fig. 513). ^ The directions m which those various curves take place are exaggerations of Fig. 512 Cyphosis. Fig. 513— Lonlosis.DEFORMITIES. 350 the natural inclination of the spinal column. In lateral curvature, the chief conTcxity takes place tou'arcls the right side, causing a projection of that shoulder winch in most people is somew'hat more prominent than the other. In cyphosis, the excurvation takes place in the lower cervical and upper dorsal regions, which are naturally prominent; and, in lordosis, the incurvation IS most marked in the lumbar region, in which there is naturally a curve forwai’ds. Causes.—These various kinds of deformity, as has already been stated, chiefly occur in girls about the age of puberty; at a time of life when the tonicity of the muscular system not unfrequently becomes lessened by the occurrence of anaemia and those states of impaired health that so frequently attend the establishment of the uterine function ; and before the osseous and ligamentous structures of the body are fully developed. At this period of life, also, it frequently happens that the spine becomes rather suddenly elongated by a rapid increase in growth ; or that it becomes overweighted by the body developing itself, and the shoulders and bust becoming stout and expanded. Indeed, so frequent is the occurrence of a certain degi-ee of lateral emwature of the spine from these various causes, about the age of puberty in girls, that few escape a tendency to deviation ; of so slight a kind, however, as not to admit of recognition as a disease. But if this tendency be allowed to go on unchecked, or if it be increased by injurious habits, amongst which are all one-sided postures in which the body is twisted, as in playing some musical instruments, or in leaning over a table in drawing and writing, the slight deviation may rapidly increase until it assume the true characters of lateral emwature. I do not think that there is any evidence to show that this is either a striunous or a rickety afPection; indeed, so far as my observation goes, I should certainly say that strumous girls are less liable to the disease than those of a nervous temperament. A rickety tendency would, of course, increase the disposition to the afiection ; but I think this is very rarely associated with it. Amongst the more common predisposing causes must undoubtedly be reckoned the in- dolent and sedentary occupations, and the luxurious enervating habits that are commonly encom’aged in girls in the higher ranks of life, and which, by pre- venting due muscidar development, at the same time that they induce a general loss of tone in the system, may directly occasion the disease. In growing lads, lateral emwature may be produced by a habitually maintained faulty position, as in writing at the desk, or in certain occupations. That the real cause of lateral cmwatiu’e of the spine is to be found in faulty habits of life, and not in sex, is evidenced from the rarity of the affection amongst girls of the labouring class, as compared with the frequency amongst those of the wealthier orders of society. Who ever saw lateral cmwatiu'e of the spine in a housemaid ? It is in the dramng-room and not in the servants’ hall that it is met ■with. The causes of the antero-posterior curves are usually to be found in some faulty habits of the jDatient; either giving rise to an habitual stoop, and thus laying the foundation for cyphosis, or throwing too great a weight on the loins, and thus giving rise to lordosis. A kind of spurious lordosis is developed in some cases of ankylosis of the hip-joint. Signs of Lateral Curvature.—The signs of this affection, when it is well marked, are distinctly obvious. The serpentine character of the curve, its351 ^^JQXS 0 F LA TEli A L C UR 1 A T URE. -nvii-v mi one side looking to the right shoulder, and on double nature, tl^e coji - ^ty ^ commonly it the other to the Mt lo condition that frequently attracts commences in a giadual ma , scapula, which is supposed to be “ “’f ,ft L" :il-^icSl k the seme Ze, ov some have been observed to project.

In the early stao-es of the disease, when the deviation is not very distinctly mai^ Se readiest mode of detei-mining it is to let the patient stand upright taking te Sat the feet are weU placed together, and that the attitude is not forced but natural; the Smgeon should then run his finger down the back from one spinous process to another, touching each as he passes it with a pen dipped in ink ; in this way, when he has reached the lower part, he will have mapped out the com’se of the vertebral column, and thus may see at a glance the nature and extent of its displace- ment. At the same time, he will probably observe that the two hips do not exactly cor- respond, the left being somewhat thrown out. Very commonly there is a good deal of neuralgic tendemess about the spine, and at this early stage there may be antemia and sym- ptoms of impaired nutrition. As the disease advances, the emwatme becomes more distinct, and at the same time, owing to the torsion of the column, assumes a shghtly angular character where most convex. The ribs on the right side are thrown out and bulging, and Fig. 514.—Lateral Ciu-vature of Siiine. carry up the scapula with them, whilst those on the left are sunk and depressed (Fig. 514). In fact, the whole of the right side of the chest and body partakes in the projection of the spine on that side, and thus adds much to the general deformity; ivhilst the left side of the chest is coiTespondingly hollowed and sunk in. When the disease has advanced in this way, it always occasions great general debility, emaciation, and pallor ; the nutrition of the body being impaired, partly by the compression to which the thoracic and abdominal organs are subjected, and partly, doubtless, by imtation of the spinal cord induced by the curvature. During the early part of the disease, the spine preserves its flexibility ; and whilst the curve is still recent, and the patient young, if the weight of the head and shoulders be taken off, it will at once resume its straight direction. Thus, if the patient be lifted off the ground by raising her up ’with the hands under the axillge, or if she be laid down on her face on a flat couch, the back will fall into a straight position, or may readily be made to do so by slight traction. After the disease, however, has existed for some years, or if the patient have passed that age at which consolidation of the bones and ligaments takes place,3S2 DEFORMITIES. the distortion will continue permanently, in whatever position she may he placed. This is not only owing to the deformity of the spine, but to the ribs, and ligamentoirs and muscular structures generally of the trunk, having become fixed in their abnormal position. Treatment.—The treatment of lateral curvature of the spine should be conducted on rational principles ; and, when divested of the mystery with which some interested specialists have surrounded it, it becomes as simple as that of any other chronic siu’gical affection of the bones, joints, or muscles. There are three principles of treatment that require to bo carried out in the manage- ment of these cases. The first is the improvement of the general health,— unless this be effected, nothing can be done ; the second is, to strengthen the muscles of the spine ; and the third, to take away as much as possible the Aveight of the head, neck, and upper extremities. The administration of some of the milder preparations of iron, with a coiu’se of aloetics for the regulation of the uterine function, is of great moment; at the same time, a nourishing diet of animal food should be alloAved, and the patient encom-aged to take exercise in the open air. By these means the nutrition of the system will be improved, and the tone of the muscles gi-eatly restored. The muscular power may be more directly strengthened by haA'ing the back Avell sponged with cold salt or vinegar and water every morning, and methodically rubbed from top to bottom. The friction should be principally directed to the erector spinas muscles on each side of the A'ertebral cohunn, and may be done either Avith the naked hand, or Avith some shghtly stimulating embrocation. At the same time, if the patient’s strength aatII permit it, but not otherwise, the use of the hand-swing may be allowed, or cahsthenic ex- ercises practised; these, however, should not be continued if they induce a feeling of fatigue or exhaustion. A^Tiilst this plan is being persevered in, the patient should be made to he recumbent for a few hours daily, sitting or standing as little as possible. By these means, assiduously continued for some length of time, the muscles of the back may be strengthened, and the increase of the deformity prevented ; and in this Avay the slighter cases of lateral curvature, those in which there is rather a tendency to than a fnh development of the disease, may be cured. In slight cases of lateral curvature, great evils may be occasioned by the- uimecessary employment of cumbersome machinery. The heavy apparatus that is often applied to growing girls overpowers and compresses, rather than supports and directs the imperfectly developed and stih yielding skeleton. By the use of these compheated machines the muscles of the back become Aveakened and atrophied from disuse ; the pelvis is compressed and con- tracted ; and those very evils are produced by the mechanician AA'hich it is the object of the Surgeon to avert or con-ect. \lTien the affection is further advanced, though the spine still continue flexible, if there be decided projection of the ribs on one side, and the shoulder' and hip be prominent, Avith apparent difference in the length of the limbs, and much impairment of the general health, more decided measures of treatment must be had recourse to. In these cases, as in those just described, the^ con- stitutional poAvers must be carefully attended to on ordinary medical principles ; iron, and good living, Avith fresh air, being the basis of the treatment. At the-MECHANJGAL TREATMENT OF LATERAL CURVATURE. 353 same time that we eutleavour to improre the strength of the system in this way, and that of the muscles of the back, especially by cold bathing and fric- tions, it is essential to adopt means to take off the weight of the head and shouldei-s, and to prevent its continuing to keep up and to increase the deformity. This may be done in two ways : by keeping the patient in the recumbent position, or by allowing her to go about, wearing proper supports. The rmonbenf position in the treatment of lateral curvature of the spine, though a valuable means as an adjimct to other measures, has been greatly abused, by being employed as an exclusive plan. This should not be, except Avhen the patient is unable to stand or walk with comfort, as happens in extreme cases, Avhen it may be necessary to confine her for a time to this position, until the proper muscular power has been restored by other means. These instances, however', are very rare ; too much so to constitute the rule in the treatment. "Whenever the recimrbent position is employed, the prone seems to me far preferable to the supine, for reasons mentioned when speaking of angular ciu'vature of the spine (p, 300) ; and the best couch for the purpose is certainly Verral’s. The patient should be kept on this during the intervals of exercise, not being allowed to sit or stand, even at meals ; she -will very soon become accustomed to a position that at first appears constrained, and null, probably, speedily be enabled to slee]r in it. The Mechanical Contrivances constructed for the pm-pose of taking the weight of the head, neck, and upper extremities off from the Aveakened- spine, are of very A'arious forms, and have had much ingenuity expended in their construction. They all have three j)rincipal objects, hoAvever much their details may vary ; A'iz. : 1, to form a broad basis of support round the poh'is, by means of a strong well-fitting band ; 2, to cany off the Aveight of the head and upper extremities from the spine by means of lateral crutches, Avhich \ transmit it to this band ; and 3, to influence the convexities of the spinal cui’Ae by means of moA’able plates, acted upon by rack-and-pinion or scrcAV poAAcr. The best of these mechanical contrivances for supporting the Aveight of the head and shoulders, is the ap- paiatus represented in the accompany- ing Avoodcut (Fig. r,ir,). Bj it the projection of the right shoulder may be gradually brought down, the left one raised, and the weight of the whole of the upper ]>art of the body supported.

At first the instrmnent need only be worn dm-ing the day, but after a time it should be kept on at night as well. In long- standing and severe cases of lateral curvature of the spine, when its flexi- bility is lost, and the projection of the ribs has become permanent, a cure cannot be expected, nor can it be brought about by any means ; but the patient will derive gi-eat com- fort and support from the use of this excellent instrument, and the increase of the disease may thus be prevented. The treatment of Posterior Excurvation of the spine, with- out caries or other organic disease of the vertebral column, is best conducted by the use of the instrument here figured (Fig. 516), which is con- structed essentially on the same principles as that for lateral cuivatme, with the ex- j-jg. 517.—siiinai sujiport for ception that the back-plate is Posterior Inciuratiou. so arranged as to press upon the projecting spine, and thus gradually to bring it into proper position. In Posterior Incurvation the apparatus here figured (Fig, 517) wiU be found the most useful apidiance. In fact, all these vai-ieties of spinal curvature may be successfully remedied by instruments constructed on the most simple mechanical principles, if carefully attended to and carried out. DEFOKMITIES OP THE NECK AND LIMBS. s Various deformities, such as squint, wry-ueck, and club-foot, are due to a disturbance of the normal equilibrium that exists between antagonistic muscles, so that, by the paralysis of one set, or by the spasmodic action of the other, the proper balance of power is lost, and the limb or part deviates from the position that is natural to it, being drawn down by the more powerful set of muscles. These deformities may be congenital, or they may be acquired. The primaiy mischief is, in many cases, seated in the nervous system; in others, but more rarely, in the muscular. The ligaments and bones only become secondarily altered in shape, being shortened or compressed on the side towards which the limb or part inclines or is drawn. Fasciie also become shortened and tense, and the disused muscles are apt to become soft, wasted, and flabby. The contracted muscle after a time becomes permanently rigid and shortened. Cause,s.—The causes of these deformities are -\'ery i-arious ; but they may be refen-ed to three heads. ].

This condition is consecutive to the displacement, but renders it permanent; it is apt to oceur after fractures, if the parts be kept for too long a time in one position, and more particularly if they be bound and matted together by the pressure of tight bandages. A somewhat similar cause sometimes operates on the foetus in utero : an abnormal position in the uterine cavity being very frequently the immediate occasion of some of the vai’ieties of congenital club-foot. These deformities must not be con- founded with congenital dislocations, in which there is always an arrest of development of some of the articular ends of the bones connected A^ith the alfeeted joint. 2. Irritation set up in the Central Portions of the ITervous System may produce deformity by deranging the proper antagonistic action of certain groups of muscles. This condition gives rise to many of the con- genital as well as of the non-congenital deformities. It may act by producing more or less complete paralysis of one set of muscles, the contractility of their antagonists continuing normal; and thus, the relative balance of action being destroyed, the stronger wiU draw the part over to their side. The influence of this want of proper balance of parts in paralysis, producing deformity, may be well seen in the peculiar deformity of the hand and forearm described at p. 415, Vol. I., from paralysis of the musculo-spiral nerve in certain fractures of the humerus, and in palsy of the portio dura, where the face is distorted by being drawn to the sound side ; or in squint, where, the sixth nerve being paralysed and the external rectus muscle having lost its motor power the eye is drawm inwards by the action of its antagonist, the internal rectus. ^ ccording to Tamphn, deformity from paralysis is never congenital, thouo-h it isnotimfrequentlymet with in infancy. Central initation may occasion detoimity in another way, by producing tonic or permanent spasm of one set other remaining perfect in their contractility, but overbalanced by the continued contraction of their antagonists. This would appear to be the case in some foms of squint.

Electricity has of late years been much and most advantageously employed in the treatment of those deformities that arise from infantile paralysis, and, indeed, generally where the deformity is due to the paralysis of one set of muscles, allowing those that possess their healthy contractility to draw the pai'ts to their sides. “ Localised faradisation ” is the method by which the electric agency is usually applied. But for the details of this method and the general question of the employment of electricity to these cases, I must refer the reader to the works of Duchenne (de Boulogne). In many cases, the contraction may he slowly but very effectually overcome by the use of suitable apparatus, having a constant elastic or tensive action kept up by means of bands of vulcanised India-rubber or steel spnngs. The details of these various apphances, though belonging to the department of the instrument-maker, cannot be too carefuUy studied by the Surgeon, who, after aU, in order to guide and control their action, must be thoroughly con- versant with the mechanical principles involved in their construction. In many of the slighter and less chi’onic cases, the deformity may be remedied by the employment of these milder means; but in those which are congenital or more permanent, the Division of the Tendons at fault is the only mode of restoring the natural condition of the part. This ortlioimd/k department of surgery owes, in a great measure, its existence to the laboiu’s of Delpech and Stromeyer, and its perfection to those of Little, Tamplin, and Adams. Tenotomy.—By tenotomy, as at present practised, is meant the subcutane- ous division of a tendon by means of a naiTow-bladed knife (Fig. 518) intro- duced obliquely through a punctiue by its side. In doing this, it should be borne in mind that the normal anatomical relations of parts are often a good deal disturbed in cases of deformity : and thus tendons may be approximated to arteries and nerves, from which, in the healthy condition of the limb, they are widely separated. The tendon may most conveniently be divided, in the majority of cases, by introducing the blade beneath it side- ways, and then turning the edge against it, scratching through it by a kind of firm sawing movement, the handle of a knife being used as a lever to press the edge against the tendon, whilst the parts are made tense by an assistant. A di'op or two only of blood ai’e lost in this simple operation ; and, as the di'sided tendon retracts with a kind of snap, a gap will be left between the two ends, fr’om half an inch to an inch in width, according to the previous amount of tension in the part. If the muscles have been contracted for some years, it will commonly be found that the fascise in the neighbourhood of the tendon have become rigid and unyielding, forming cords or bands stretching across Fig. 518.- the side of the gap. If these be very tense, they may bo divided in the same way ; but in many instances it will be found, after the lapse of a sliort time, that they will yield, and con^- quently will not require division. After the section has been made, the small puncture should be closed with a pad of hut and a strip of plas n.357 REF AIR IN DIVINED TENDONS. the admission of air into the wound being carefully guarded against. The whole success of the operabion depends on this. Should air enter, inflam- mation and suppuration will to a certainty be set up ; whereas, if this be avoided, the wound will heal liy the effiision of plastic matter without any inflamm’atioii. It is the entry of air, and not the subcutaneous wound, that gives rise to inflammation. The part should then be simply bandaged and dther left without any apparatus, or supported by a splint in the same position that it occupied before the tendon was cut, no attempt at extension being made for tliree or foin days. At the expiration of this time lymph will have'^been thrown out, and then proper mechanical contrivances may be adjusted for gi’adually restoring the normal position of the limb or part; if this be done°too soon, the cicatrix will be extended at too early a period after the deposit of the plastic matter, and the tendon will become weakened and too much elongated. Chloroform is not always admissible in these operations. ‘WTien the musck is not permanently shortened, but only contracted under its influence, it becomes so much relaxed that the defined edge of the tendon disappears, and the proper section cannot be made. Sayi’e adopts a different method. He makes extension immediately after the division of tendons and fasciae, and I have seen excellent results foUow this practice. It is not, however, applicable in all cases, as, in some instances of tahpes of old standing, the contraction appears to exist in the ligaments as weU as in the more superficial structures. In such cases considerable resistance will be offered, and long continued extension be required. The mode of Repair in Divided Tendons has given rise to some con- troversy, there being two theories with regard to the process. According to one, the plastic matter deposited between the divided and retracted ends gradually undergoes a process of contraction, analogous to what takes place in the cicatrix of a bum, so as to cause approximation of the cut ends of the tendon at the expense of the muscle, Avhich becomes partially lengthened, imtil at last a transverse linear cicatrix merely is left at the line of section. Adams has, however, conclusively shown that this theory is erroneous, and that repair is effected by the deposit of plastic matter betAveen the cut ends, chiefly from the sheaths and sof t parts around ; that this plastic matter under- goes gradual transformation into tendinous tissue ; and that the tendon is actually lengthened and remains permanently so, by the deposit of this new material, Avhich eA'entually resembles the normal structure of tendon so closely that the microscope fails to detect any appreciable difference, and that it can only be distinguished by its more translucent appearance from the old tendon. In fact, the divided tendon is completely reproduced. In cases of congenital malformation, the question frequently arises as to Avhether tenotomy should be performed in early infancy, or delayed to a more adA anced age. As a general rule I think that, if imperative, the sooner these operations are done the better ; they are not more difficult at an early period of life than at any other, no danger attends them, and Avhen they are per- formed during infancy, there is a far loss chance of the deformity being per- manent, than if the operation be delayed for some years. But it must be remembered that many slight deformities and contractions in infants may beDEFORMITIES. 358 removed without operation, by attention to proper meehanical and hygienic moans. The Surgeon should, therefore, not be too ready to operate in slight cases at tender ages. DEFOBMITIES APPEOTINa THE PACE AND NECK* WuY-NECK.—Wry-neck, Torticollis, or Caput Obstipum, arises from spasm of one of the sterno-mastoid muscles ; the head being drawm to the aliected side. On close examination in wry-neck, it wiU be found that there is a triple displacement of the head, which is drawn do-wnwards, rotated out- wards, and inclined laterally towards the affected side. The features lose their symmetry. The half of the face, and even of the head, on the affected side, becomes less perfectly developed ; and the true line of the eyebrows, eyes, and mouth becomes displaced and lowered. In torticollis, the affected sterno-cleido-mastoid will be found hard, defined, and shortened ; sometimes both divisions of the muscle are equally tense, standing out in strong rehef, so as almost to look like two distinct muscles. In other cases, one division, and then most usually the sternal, is chiefly affected. After a time the cervical vertebrae participate in and maintain the displacement, becoming rotated on their axes and curved. Eventually the whole spinal column participates in the disj^lacement, and lateral curvatiu'e sets in. The deeper muscles also become shortened, and the anterior margin and clavicular attachment of the trapezius wiU often be found tense and j)re- ternatui-ally defined. Causes.—Wry-neck occasionally appears to be congenital : more frequently it is acquired, coming on in childhood after measles or scaiiatina, usvially as a consequence of inflamed cervical glands, and is then due to the position instinctively assumed by the head in order to relax muscular tension on the inflamed side of the neck. It not unfrequently commences with an ordinary stiff neck from cold. In other cases, again, it is pimely spasmodic, the tension of the muscle varying at different times, disappearing when the child is an£esthetised, and being overcome by gentle traction. In these cases the spinal accessory nerve is probably at fault, and it is owing to the irritation of it that the sterno-mastoid and trapezius muscles take on a spasmodic action. In spasm of both sterno-mastoids the head is thrown forwards, the muscles projecting in gTeat rehef. In these cases, the disease will usually be found to have had a rheumatic origin. Deformity in this situation may also occui from diseased cervical vertebrEC, or fr'om the traction of the cicatrix of a burn, ihe condi- tions here, however, are peculiar, depending upon causes that are irrespective of the state of the muscles, which are not tense, and may thus readily be dis- tiuo'uished fr'om the true form of the disease produced by the causes above mentioned. TrealmenL—The treatment of torticollis ailsiug fr'om permanent spasm of one of the sterno-mastoids, which is the common form of the aftection, maj best be conducted by dividing the inferior attachment of the muscle, and thiis EiUowing the head to regain its proper position. The division of the muscle is a somewhat delicate operation, on account of the important structures that he immediately behind it. By making the incision, however, tlirough it, from * For Squint, vUh Chapter ou “ Oiihthnlmic Suigerj.359 TREATMENT OF WRY-NECK. behind forwards, close to the sternum and along the clavicle, there can, if ordinary care be employed, be little risk of doing any damage, as these bones carry the lower attachment of the muscle forwards, and separate it from sub- jacent parts. The tension also, into which it is thrown by its spasm, di-aws it away fi-om the carotid sheath. In several instances in which I have had occasion to perfonn this operation, no difficulty whatever has been experienced in dividing the sternal attachment of the muscle, Avhich is usually very tense and prominent, by passing an ordinary tenotome behind the tendon, with its hat side towards it, just in front of the upper margin of the sternum, and then cutting forwards, whilst the muscle is put well upon the stretch. In dividing the claAicular insertion, the safest plan, I think, consists in making a puncture ■with a scalpel upon and do\^m to the clavicle in the cellular space which lies between the two attachments of the muscle, and then pushing a long, blunt- pointed, naiTow-bladed tenotome between that bone and the insertion of the muscle, dividing this in a direction forwards. Care must be taken to divide the muscle completely, but not to carry the incision too. freely or deeply. I have heard of more than one case in which, from want of due precaution, abundant haemoirhage occurred, and of three in which fatal results followed the operation. After the opei’ation, the position of the head must be gradually rectified by proper apparatus. The best instrument for this pui’pose is the one invented by li^re figured (Fig. 51!)). It consists of a peh'ic band, a vertebral stem, and arm-pieces, the object of which is to secure a firm basis of support to the neck lever (1), and the maxillary lever (2). The neck lever passes round the head, and takes its bearing against the tem]Doral bone on the side towards which the head is deflected. The maxillary lever acts against the lower jaw on the opposite side— that which is turned up. By means of a ratchet- joint the neck lever, the action of which is vertical, tiims the head from the side to which it is deflected, whdst the maxillary lever, acting horizontally, rotates the head on its vertebral axis. By the combined action of these two forces the head is restored to its vertical position, and the chin replaced in the mesial line.

When my-neck is sccondaiy to disease'' of the cervical vertebras, little can be done except to maintain the spinal cohunn in as steady and fixed a position as possible, by means of mechanical support (vide Fig. 254, Vol. I.). In those cases in which the wry-neck appears rather to be dependent on paralysis of one stemo-mastoid, than on spasm of the other, electricity, and tlie application of strychnine to a blistered surface over the muscle, will be found most useful. DEPOBMITIES OP THE ABM AND HAND. Contraction of the Arm is not of very common occiUTence, except as the result of burns. I have, however, met with four distinct forms of contraction of the forearm. 1. There may be ankylosis of the elbow-joint, the foreai-m being bent at a right angle with the arm, the result of disease of or aroimd the articulation, if the ankylosis be fibrous, and the muscles strong and firm, a very useful limb may be restored by breaking down adhesions, under chloroform, by forcible flexion and extension, and then using passive motion, friction, and douches. Should the muscles be very flaccid and wasted, forcible extension )nay leave a permanently weakened limb, over which the patient has lost the power of flexion. In such cases I have found gradual extension, made by means of an angular splint, acted upon by a ratchet-apparatus, the safest means of restoring the utility of the arm. If the ankylosis be osseous, the bones should be resected, a wedge-shaped piece being sawn out, and a false joint allowed to form. 2. The biceps may, by its contraction, occasion a permanent flexion of the arm. This contraction of the biceps may be hysterical or rheumatic. When hysterical, occurring in young women, it requires the ordinary constitutional treatment of hysteria ; should this fail in removing it, extension may be made, under chloroform, and the arm kept in the straight position for a time. When it is rheumatic, or of organic character, and j)ermanent, section of the tendon and its aponeurosis may be practised, due care being taken of the artery and nerve. This operation is most safely done by introducing the tenotome to the inner side of the tendon, slipping it rmder, and cutting upwards and out- wards ; the artery being guarded and pushed to the inner side by the pressure of the left forefinger. 3. The forearm may be forcibly pronated and flexed as the result of chronic inflammation of the radio-humeral articulation. Here forcible supination and extension, imder chloroform, is the best remedy. 4. The forearm may be bent on the arm in consequence of the contraction of the cicatrix of a burn along the inside of the limb. In this case, the plastic operation described at page 261, Vol. I., must be practised. Ankylosis of the Arm in the Straight Position is a condition of very serious inconvenience, the limb being almost useless for all oi’dinary jjurposos of life. In cases of this kind, the treatment to be adopted must depend upon whether the ankylosis be fibrous or osseous. It it bo fibi’ous, however fii’ni, the forearm may always I'eadily be brought into a I’ectangular position by flc.xion under chloroform, and the mobility ot the joint may then be improved361 CONTRACTION OF THE FINGERS. Vjfr 520 —Contraction of Suiiinators of Forearm and Extensoro ° of the Hand. the Hand is occa- sionally met ivith in adults. I Imve seen it in two opposite conditions ; that ot forcible extension (Fig. 520), and that of forcible flexion and pronation (Fig. 521). In both in-' stances it appeared to have been the result of excessive use of certain muscles ; in the first case in ■wrmging out clothes, in the other in cutting with very heaiT" shears. In the case of flexion and pronation, it was interesting to observe that, when the fingers were extended, the wrist became flexed, and when the m’ist was extended the Angel’S became bent in. In these cases change of occupation, friction, and galvanism, with the use of a straight splint, were advantageously re- sorted to, a cure being eventually effected. Paralysis of the Extensors and Supinators, owing to injury of the musculo-spiral nerve consequent on fracture of the humerus, with or without tonic contraction of the flexors and pronators, has been described at page 415, Fig. 521.—Contraction of Flexors and Pronators of the Hand. Vol. I. Club-hand.—A deformity resembling club-foot has occasionally, though very rarely, been met with in the hand. The contraction may occin- in two directions ; either in the sense of preternatural flexion, or in that of abnormal extension of the member. It has been described by Cruveilhier, Voillermicr, and Smith of Dublin. In most of the cases that have been met with, there was a certain amount of deformity of the lower end of the radius, w’ith con- genital dislocation of the wi’ist; and in Smith’s case there was an accessory semilunar bone in the carpus. Little, if anything, can bo done by siu’gery for the relief of this deformity ; though some benefit might possibly result from the division of any tendons that were preternaturally tense. Contraction of the Fingers.—One or more fingers may bo bent in con- sequence of contraction of the flexor tendons ; the skin and fascial structures of the palm remaining sound. But this is not the form of contraction that is362 DEFORMITIES. usually met with. In this, the true digital coutraetiou, the tendons are unatlected, and the deformity is due to changes taking place in the integu- uieutal and fascial structures outside them. ]\'Iost commonly this commences in the little finger, and thence gradually extends to the ring and middle fingers, which become so forcibly and firmly curved inwards, that their exten- sion is not practicable. It usually results from frequent and continued pressiu’e on the palm of the hand, as in leaning on a round-ended stick in walking, or in those trades in which an instrument requires to be pressed into the hollow of the hand. It occurs, however, in persons in the prime of life •without any apparent exciting cause. In such cases I have always found it associated with a rheumatic or gouty diathesis ; the disease in fact consisting in chronic thickening of the fascite of the palm and fingers, resulting from rheumatic inflammation of or deposits in these parts. On examining the con- tracted fingers, projecting ridges will be felt extending fr’om the palm to their anterior aspects ; and on endeavouring to straighten them, these ridges will be found to become stretched, and the palmar fascia to be rendered tense. The skin covering these fascial ridges is usually healthy, but sometimes adherent to them. So firmly are the fingers contracted, that by no effort can they be extended. Pathology.—The pathology of this contraction has given rise to a good deal of difference of opinion amongst Sm’geons. Dupuytren appears to have been the first who endeavom’ed, by dissection, to ascertain its true character. He found, on examining a hand which was the seat of this disease, that, after the removal of the skin, which was loose and flaccid, the contraction continued as before, and this, therefore, could not be its seat; but that the pahnar fascia, which was exposed, was tense and diminished in size, whilst from the lower aspect some cord-like prolongations passed up by the side of the fingers ; and that, when these were di'vided, the contraction was immediately removed, the tendons, the bones, and the joints being perfectly sound. He considered these fibrous cords to be digital prolongations of the pahnar fascia, and consequently looked upon this membrane as the seat of the disease. Goyrand, who has carefully dissected hands affected in this way, states that these fibrous cords, which he looks upon as the seat of the affection, are not prolongations of the palmar fascia, but are ligamentous structm’es that extend from its anterior inferior aspect to the sheaths of the flexor tendons, into which they are inserted opposite the second phalanx ; being an hypertrophied condition of the subcii- taneous filaments of fibro-cellular tissue which natmally exist in this situation. The Diagnosis of cases of digital contraction, so fixr as the deformity is coin cerned, is obvious, and requires no comment; so far as the cause is concerned, it is not so easy. Is it tendinous or fascial ? When tendinous, the contracted tendon can be followed up to and above the wrist as a tense cord ; the structures being healthy. AVhen fascial, the tendon cannot be clearly defined, but the palmar structines are dense, thickened, and incorporated together, forming distinct ridges and sulci. ■, i • , 1 « n .-f,, This time digital contraction must not be confounded with that arthriti defonnans,” which often distorts the weather-beaten hands of labouring men and sailora.

Treatment.—The treatment of digital contractions is purely operative. The kind of operation must be determined by the pathological cause of the disease. If the contraction be tendinous, then subcutaneous tenotomy must be done. If, as far more commonly is the case, it be fascial, then the tendonand its sheath must not be touched, but the contracted structures outside them must be cut acix)ss. This consists, when the deformity is slight and recent, in dividing each tense digital fascial lU’olongation by a subcutaneous incision. This should be done opposite the second phalanx, where it is usually most tense ; but, if the other finger-joints be affected, a separate section maybe required opposite each phalanx. Should it be found to be impossible to straighten the fingers with such limited incisions, or should the skin be firmly adherent to the subjacent fibrous band, a long crucial incision may be made through the skin, the flaps dissected back, the fascial bands divided or dissected off the sheaths of the tendons, and the fingers straightened. As the flexor tendons are not primarily affected, they need not be di\ided. After the operation, the hand should be placed on a digitated splint, and the fingers kept extended. Busch recommends the following modified operation, fi'om Avhich he says that he has derived excellent results in many cases. A A-shaped incision is made through the skin of the j}alm. The base coiTesponds to the fmvow separating the bent finger from the palm of the hand. The apex reaches to the highest parts of the contraction when the finger is well stretched. The skin is dissected up from the apex towards the base, all condensed connecth'e tissue removed, all fibrous cords passing upwards fr-om the palmar fascia cut thiough, and the palmar fascia itself incised on each side of the sheath of the tendon, which is not touched. The finger gTadually straightens itself during this operation. The fiaiD is then laid down, and no extension apparatus or passi\ e movement is employed until the wound is granulating. Congenital Deformities of the Fingers and Hand are frequently met Avith. ^ 1. The most common form consists in a Supernumerary Finger or Fingers. These are of several different kinds. There is, in the fii-st place, that form of supernumerary finger in which the added digit appears to be simply a con mua ion 0 the natui’al series, so that there are six fingers instead of fiA'e. * Morand describes a hand having a thumb and six we ormec trough somewhat shortened fingers.

All these varieties of deformity of the fingers. are more or less hereditary, and may veiy easily be removed by operation, which is simple and perfectly safe, the supernumerary finger being dis- articulated at its base. It is better to do this at as early an age as possible : no good can possibly come of delay. 4. There is a rare variety of con- genital deformity of the hand and fingers, in which the fingers are supernumerary, in consequence of a dee]} bifurcation of the hand. 5. In some rai’e cases, as in that from which the annexed draiving (Fig. 523) was taken, two hands appear to be fused into one. In these cases, no opera- tion can be advantageously practised. Besides these, various other kinds of congenital defomiity of the fingers are met with. One or more fingers may be pretematiu-ally long, or abnormally short, thick, or atrophied ; or one finger may be entirely absent. The accompanying drawings (Figs. 524 and 525) are coiTect representations of a remarkable deformity of the hand in a child that was imder my care some Fig. 522.—Supenuiineraiy Tliiuub. Fig. 523.—Appaaeut iMsion of Hauds. years ago. The fingers appear to have suffered in some instances complete, in others partial, amputation in utcro. They arc marked by deep transverse sulci; others are shortened, and terminate in rounded nodules, with a narrow pedicle connecting them with the proximal phalanx. Webbing of the Fingers is occasionally met with. In this condition a cutaneous septum unites all the contiguous fingers. Sometimes the malforma- tion is confined to one digital interspace, and then it is usually that between the index and middle fingers. In other cases it occupies two or all three in- terspaces. The web is a tolerably thick septum of skin, narrow at the base,3^5 TREATMENT OF WEBBED FINGERS. Ijroacler above. It may extend the whole length of the fingers, or only a por- tion. The Aveb does not interfere A\ith the movements of the fingers in flexion or extension. This deformity is readily remedied by operation. The web may be di\ided in different ways. The plan that I have always successfully adopted consists in separating the fingers widely, and then cutting through the Aveb from its ft-ec edo-e, keeping accurately to the middle line as far as the l^ase of the finger, makino- the incision longer on the dorsal than on the palmar aspect; or the Aveb may be transfixed at the base, and the incision made forwards. Some Surgeons transfix the base with a ligature or Avire, and, bringing it over the fi-ee edge, gi-adually tighten it, and so divide the abnormal bond of union. The objection to this process is that it is sIoav and painful. After the division of the Aveh, the hand should be put on a splint, and a piece of lint interposed be- tAveen the separated fingers during the whole process of union, so as to prevent any chance of re-adhesion. When the septum is very dense, the folloAving operation, invented by Didot of Liege, may be adA'antageously practised. Sup- posing the index and middle finger to be Avebbed, the foUoAving would be the procedure to be adopted, Avhich is of com’se equally applicable to any of the other fingers. 1. The Singeon makes an incision along the median line of the palmar aspect of the index finger, extending the whole length of the web. 2. Two small transverse incisions are now made at the upper and lower ends of this longitudinal incision, extending from it to the ends of the web. 3. The rectangular flap thus defined is dissected back as thick as possible, so that its base corresponds to the mid-line of the web. 4. A coiTesponding longitudinal incision is noAv made along the dorsal surface of the middle finger, but comes rather further doAvn on the hand. The two transA'-erse incisions at its upper nnd lower ends are next made, and the flap thus defined is dissected back, and AA'hen the knife reaches the mid-line of the web the tAvo fingers Avill be found to be separated. 5. The next and last step of the operation is to AATap each flap round the raw surface of the finger to Avhich it continues to be attached, and to fix it in situ by three or foin points of sutine. Thus the raw sinface on the index finger will be covered by the flap taken from the dorsmn of the middle, and vice versa, as is seen in the accompanying diagram (Fig. o20).

Knock-knee.—The deformity termed Genu Valgum, Knock or K-Knee, usually affects botli extremities, though it is generally more fully developed in one than in the other. In it the knee forms the apex of a triangle, the base et which would be represented by a line drawn from the trochanter to the outer ankle. It is usually conjoined with some cmwatiu’e of the bones of the leg. It is not congenital, but commonly occurs in consequence of children being jmt upon their feet too early, the limbs thus giving way under the weight of the body. Bock states that, out of 221 cases which he examined, 17 originated about the period of the first dentition ; and about 200 between that age and the loth or 18th year. Some occupations are said to predispose to it, smiths being especially liable to the disease. In it there is relaxation of the internal lateral ligament; the biceps, the external lateral ligament, and often the vastus externus, are very tense; and the patella is thrown outwards. The externai condyle of the femur will generally be found to be small, and the hollow of the- ham to be obliterated. Treatment.—The treatment consists, in the slighter cases, in applying an- apparatus consisting of a well-padded iron stem along the outside of the leg and thigh ; this must extend from the trochanter to the outer ankle, being fixed to a pelvic band at the upper part, and into a boot below (Fig. 528). Where it corresponds to the knee it should be- provided with a hinge, and should have a broad well-padded strap passing from its under side, over the inner side of the joint, and attached by buckles to the upper part of the stem, in such a Avay that by tightening these the knee may be drawn outwards. This apparatus should be con- stantly worn for many months ; and, if properly adapted, may effect a cme. When the deformity is of old standing, and the parts about the outer side of the joint very tense, the biceps tendon may require division.. In doing this, cai’e must be taken not to injure the peroneal nerve. In some cases the vastus externus and contiguous portion of the fascia lata may also be advantageously divided, and the apparatus then applied as directed. There is a form of bandy-leg which appears - to be due not to cmwature of the shaft of the tibia, but to a displacement inwards of the lower' epiphysis of the bone, which at its line of junction with the shaft, appears to have yielded under the weight of the body, and so doubled inwards, carrying with it the foot. ■ • ^ • f Contraction of the Knee-joint.—Contraction of the knee-joint is one of the most distressing deformities to which the human fr-amc is liable. If it be severe, the leg is bent at nearly, or perhaps at quite, a right angle with c thigh. It is fixed in this position, so that the patient cannot put the sole o Fig. 528.—Aiiimratiis for Knock-knue.CONTRACTION' OF KNEE-JOINT. 3°7 • -i? i-r. rrr/-mTifl • Tipiinn t.hfi limb becomes 367 troublesome ulceration. 1 t, i. In the less severe fonns of contracted knee, the inconvenience, though not so <^reat as that just described, is very considerable ; for, as the patient cait never bring the heel or sole to the ^^ound, he rests insecurely on the tips ol' his toes, and walks but unsteadily with the aid of a crutch or stick. Varieties.—This deformity may be of two kinds. 1. It may consist of simple flexion of the leg on the thigh, at a greater or less angle, and with more or less mobility, according to the degree of ankylosis. 2. In addition to this, there- may be horizontal displacement of the bones, the head of the tibia being thrown backwards, the femur and patella remaining in situ, but apparently projecting* more than is natural. In examining a case of contraction of the knee-joint, the patient should be placed on his face, with the thigh extended. The leg on the affected side will then be raised more or less perpendicularly, and the amount of contraction may be judged of by the angle that it forms ivith the thigh. The degree of mobility also may readily be ascertained. In this way a more correct idea of the amount of contraction can be obtained than by examining the patient whilst lying on the back, when, in consequence of the thigh being flexed on the abdomen, the- extent of the angular deformity cannot be so well determined. Causes.—Contraction of the knee-joint may arise from a great variety of pathological conditions. Some of these are altogether external to the joint, being seated in the nerves or muscles of the limb ; whilst others, and the majority, consist in some morbid change that has taken place 'within the joint itself in its ligamentous or osseous structures. As the contraction depends on such very varied causes, the Treatment, having reference to the cause as well as to the actual morbid conditions, must be equally diversified. Contraction from Nervous Irritation is usually associated 'with general hysteria, of which it is but a local symptom, and commonly occurs in girls and young women. In this form of contraction there *is no evidence of disease within the joint ; no redness, swelling, or other sign of inflammation ; but there is great pain and tenderness about it. This pain, as usual in hysterical cases, is superficial and cutaneous, and radiates to some distance beyond the- articulation. Any attempt at straightening the limb not only greatly increases the pain, but also calls the adjoining muscles into such forcible action that it is impossible to improve the position. These local symptoms are connected with the ordinary signs of an hysterical temperament, with spinal irritation,, and often with uterine derangement. The 'Treatment of these cases of hysterical contraction of the knee is simple. The first thing to bo done is to straighten the limb. This can only be effected by putting the patient under the influence of chloroform, wdien, all sensibility368 DEFORMITIES. being suspended, the muscular opposition, which is partly voluntary, and no doubt in some measure reflex, is no longer called into action, and the limb falls of i,ts own aefcord almost into the straight position, in which it must be retained by means of a long splint, lost the retraction recur with returning consciousness ; and then, the hysterical condition being removed by troatmeih calculated to improve the general health, the tendency to the retm-n of the deformity will be obviated. 'W e occasionally see contraction of the knee from spasmodic action of the hamstiings, pioduced by some irritation applied to the nerv'es at a distance from the part. Just as spasm of the internal rectus muscle of the eye occasions squint, so long as the irritation that gives rise to the spasm lasts ; so there may be spasm of the hamstrings, with contraction of the knee as a consequence. Most commonly, however, the joint itself is at fault, either in consequence of subacute inflammatory action within it, or of the chronic and pei’manent changes induced by former inflammatory attacks. Contraction from Inflammation of the Knee.—In inflammation of the knee, the patient naturally and instinctively places the limb in the semiflexed position, as being that in which there is least tension exercised on the structures that enter into the joint, and consequently that which is most congenial to his feelings. This position, which is immediately as- sumed on the occiu'rence of acute and active inflammation in the joint, comes on more gradually in cases of subacute inflammation ; and here the symptoms of disease in the joint may be so slight that the contraction may be considered the chief ailment, and engvoss too exclusively the Sur- geon’s attention. Chronic Contraction.—The next class of cases that we have to consider are those of a more chronic and intractable kind, lasting often for years, dependent upon structural lesions of a deep and important character in and around the joint, and requiring veiy active surgical interference for their cure. These chronic forms of contracted knee appear to arrange themselves in three distinct varieties, being dependent—1, on Consolidation and Contraction of the Ligamentous Structures in or around the joint; 2, on Pemanent Con- traction of the Muscles, with or without the last-named condition ; and, 3, on Osseous Ankylosis. Each of these varieties will require separate consideration, as each demands a special mode of treatment for its cme. 1. Those cases of contrstetion of the knee that depend on Consolidation of the Lujamentous Structures in and around the joint, resulting firom tbimer inflam- matory attacks, arc not only the most numerous, but the most readily amenable to treatment. When the structures outside the joint, such as the capsule and ligaments, are the parts chiefly affected, the inflammation has usually been of a rheumatic character. When the internal structures have lieen disorganised, and fibroid deposits ha-\-c taken place within the joint, the inflammation has generally been strumous. In these cases the knee is usually fixed at or near a right angle, and is capable of but ^'ery limited motion ; to such a degi’ce only, in most instances, as will allow the foot to move to the extent of two or three inches. The hamstriug muscles arc not tense, cncu when the knee is extended to its utmost; and, indeed, in some eases they areTREATMENT OF CONTRACTION OF THE KNEE. 369 flaccid, and feel soft. Not iinfrequently the leg can be extended np to a certain point, Avith as much freedom as in the natuival state, and then further movement is checked by a sudden stop. If this be not dependent on the tibia coming into contact Avith an ankylosed patella, it is OAving to shortening of the posterior or of one of the cracial ligaments, or to the formation of adhesions Avithin the joint. In this form of contraction, the knee is often much dis- torted, in consequence of the head of the tibia being partially dislocated back- Avards, the femur having its axis directed more or less on one side, most commonly inAA'ards, constituting a kind of genu valgum. In fact, in these cases the distortion of the limb is of a threefold character ; there are, 1, con- traction in the angular direction backAvards ; 2,, disj)lacement of the head of the tibia backvA’ards from the loAver end of the femur, which projects consider- ably fonvards ; and 3, rotation of the leg and foot outwards. The angular contraction is dependent upon adhesions in the joint, and on the gradual tendency to flexion that all inflamed joints assiune. The partial dislocation backAvards is dependent on softening and consequent relaxation, either of the ligamentum patelte or of one or other of the lateral ligaments. When the head of the tibia is displaced backAvards, it will most generally be fomid that the ligamentiun patellae has been either partially absorbed, and thus Aveakened ; or that it is elongated, the patella being draAvn upAA^ards or to one side. In either way, the action of the extensor muscles of the thigh upon the head of the tibia is weakened ; and that bone, being consequently brought under the in- fluence of the hamstrings without a countei-poise, is draAvn backwards (Fig. 52!)). In those cases in which there is lateral rotation of the tibia, the faulty position may either haA'e arisen ft’om the attitude that limb has been alloAvcd to assume dm-ing the progress of the disease in the joint or the leg Avas rotated outwards by the action of the biceps overcomino- that of tlie inner hamstrings.

The patient being fuUy ,mlr the ng on his face, the Surgeon, standing aboA'i influence of chloroform, and lyi VOL, IX. ^ B 11deformities. 370 him, seizes the foot of the affected limb with one liand, whilst with the other ho steadies the limb just above the knee. Ho now extends the lo<r gradually but forcibly ; as it comes forwards, the bands of adhesion in and around the joint will be felt and heard to give way with loud snaps and cracks, distinctly audible at some distance. Should there be much resist- ance within the joint, the Sm-geon may apply his own knee or elbow to the upper^ sm-tace, and thus increase the force Avith which the limb is acted upon. In this Wcy I have never found any contractions of the kind now undei- consideration able to resist the Surgeon’s efforts, nor any difficulty in effect- ing at once the extension of the limb. Hor have I ever seen any evil con- sequences result; indeed, it is sm-prising to what an amount of force a joint that has been contracted for any length of time may be subjected without inconvenience. In these cases it would appear as if the synoHal membrane lost its susceptibility to inflame, just as is the case ^dth serous membranes that have been the seat of chronic inflammation and its conse- quences. Beyond some pain for a few days, and slight heat, easily subdued by cold evaporating lotions, I have never seen any ill results arise ; but then care must be taken that no inflammatory action is going on mthin the joint at the time of this manipulation, as, if such action were present, the operation would certainly be followed by injurious results. After the extension has been made, the limb should be fixed on a long splint, well padded, some evaporating lotions applied, and the patient kept in bed for a few days, after which, mth the aid of a starched bandage, he may walk about. When the triple displacement which has already been referred to exists— viz., angular contraction, displacement of the head of the tibia backwards, and rotation of the limb outwards—simple extension is no longer sufficient for the remedying of the deformity. In these cases the hamstring tendons may often require division, generally on both sides—sometimes only the external one ; and extension may then require to be effected, either forcibly, or by the gradual and slow action of rack-and-pinion apparatus. After extension has been effected, the position of the head of the tibia backwards may still occasion considerable deformity and weakness of the limb (Fig. 530). This corrdition is best removed by the use of the instrumerrt of which the sketch orr rrext page (Fig. 531) is a good representation; it was designed and con- structed by that excellent srrrgical mechanician, Mr. Bigg. The diagram (Fig. 530) represerrts a limb with the tibia displaced backwards, the angular contraction having been remedied. In the cerrtres of the end of the thigh- bone and of the head of the tibia, two letters (X and Z) arc jrlaced to desig- rrate the axis of each bony head, beneath and above which the displaced joint has formed its abnormal axis. The dotted lines represerrt the leverage formed by the cylindrical surface of the tibia and thigh-bone. The arrows are placed in such a direction as the bones would take in resuming their irormal position. It will readily be seen that any instrument capable of acting irr the nrechani- cal directions showrr by the arrows, would not only accomplish the restoration of the joint, but extend, if contracted, the extremities of both femur and tibia. An additional advantage that this instrument possesses over any other with which I am acqrrairrted, is the applicatioir of spring-power, by means otTREATMENT OP CONTRACTION OF THE KNEE. 371 •which flexion of the knee becomes an element towards the restoration of its utility. Instead of muscular action being arrested, and atrophy of the limb being thus produced, move- ment is conducive to the perfect action of the appai’atus ; so that the patient , experiences but little incon- venience from its use, aU the ordinary positions assimaed by the knee in walking, sitting, or standing being preserved. By this form of apparatus, then, three important points are secured : viz., replacement of the head of the tibia, exten- sion ot the angle of the leg, and tree muscular action diming the period of treatment. In Fig. 531, A and B are two levers, composed of metal, coiTesponding in their dfrection to the perpendicular position of the thigh-bone and tibia. C and D are two axes, placed exactly coincident -iidth the centres of the articular ends of the bones. E and F are two ^ ~ \ powerful springs, acting in ^^ opposing directions ; viz., in those indicated by the arrows in Fig. 530.

P. n 2DEFORMITIES. 372 that in whicli the Ilnmslrmgs are Contradecl, cither alone or in addition to those results of ehronic inflammatory action within the joint that have just been described. Tn these cases the hamstrings will be found to be tight; and, in proportion as the leg is extended on the thigh, they will become more tense, until at last all further extension is resisted, a])parently by their traction, and not by any sudden check or stop -wathin the joint itself. Division of the Hamstring Tendons is in ordinary cases as simple an operation as any in surgery, unattended by any dilficulty, provided the Surgeon introduce the tenotome parallel and close to the side of the tendon to he divided, and cut in a direction from the inside or popliteal aspect towards the skin. The outer hamstring will usually be found to be the most tense, and should first be divided. In doing this, the peroneal nerve might appear to be in danger ; but this may be avoided by keeping the side of the tenotome well against the inner edge of the biceps tendon, then turning the edge outwards, when passed deeply enough. The semitendinosus next requires division. The semimembranosus need not often be cut across. After the division of the tendons, tense aponeurotic bands will not unfrcquently be found to stretch along one or both sides, or perhaps doA\m the centre of the popliteal space. This may lead to the idea on the part of the Surgeon that he has not fairly cut the tendons across ; but this is an error. The bands alluded to are condensed sharp-edged prolongations of the fascia lata, formed during the period of con- traction of the joint by the retraction and thickening of this membranous expansion. Such condensations as these had better be left untouched, as they Avill readily stretch out under gradual extension, or be ruptured by forcible traction of the limb. If, on the other hand, the Surgeon be tempted by their apparently superficial and safe position to proceed to their division, he may lie led into a serious dilemma by being brought more closely into contact with the popliteal A’essels than is desirable or safe. In these cases, the anatomical relations of parts are so much altered by the narroAving of the popliteal space, and by the projection of the head of the tibia backwards, or by its lateral rotation, that the Surgeon is unable to calcidate Avith sufficient nicety the precise position of the large vessels and nerves in the neighbourhood of Avhich he is about to act; and he may thus injure one or other of these at a time AAffien he thinlvS that he is operating at a safe distance from them. After the division of the hamstrings, the knee does not commonly come readily into the straight position, OAving to the shortening of the posterior liga- ment ; and gradual extension, by means of proper apparatus, aauU be required to OA'ercome this and to stretch the adhesions within and around the joint. Contraction with. Lateral Displacement is not unfrcquently met Avith. In these cases the knee is contracted more or less in the angular direction ; but, in addition to this, the lower end of the thigh-bone is diiected iiraards, and perhaps somcAAffiat forAA'ards, and the tibia is rotated outv ards, caiiying the foot with it. There is thus a triple deformity—angular, mesial, and rotatory. I believe the angular to be the primary deformity and the mesial and rotatory to be secondary to this, arising partly from the efforts of the patient to walk by resting on the point of the great toe, and throwing the thigh inwards m order to effect this, and partly from the action of the biceps rotating the leg outAvards.OSSEOUS ANKYLOSIS OF THE KNEE. 37.1 The Treatment of these cases is not very satisfactory. The obstacle to the restoration of the normal position of the joint is dependent, so far as the angular contraction is concerned, on shortening of the ligamentum posticiun, and the rotiitory displacement is kept up and rendered intractable by shortening of the anterior crucial ligament. jMere extension of the limb, whether gradual or forced, may counteract the angular deformity ; but it will not only leave the. other displacements uninfluenced, but may actually increase the displacement of the tibia backwards and the rotation of the leg outwards. A leg-and-thigh splint, such as in Fig. 031, but having, instead of the springs, a rack-and- pinioii apparatus working on three centres, so as to extend the limb, abduct the knee, and rotate the leg inwards, is the only contrivance by which this de- formity can be counteracted, and the limb properly restored to shape. In reference to the treatment' of these various deformities of the extremities, it may be stated generally that it is much easier to rectify faulty position than to restore mobility. The first may always be done by the various means that have been enumerated ; the latter can only be effected, if at aU, by long-con- tinued efforts on the part of the Sm-geou, by passive motion, frictions, sham- pooing, &c., aided by properly constructed apparatus. In ankylosis of the knee, after extension has been made, and the limb brought straight, the question arises as to Avhether mobility of the joint should be eucoiu-aged, or the limb kept straight and made stiff. The answer to this question will greatly depend on conditions of the muscles of the thigh. If the quadi’iceps extensor exhibit electric irritability, then, if the state of the joint admit it, motion may be attempted. If the muscle be insensible to the stimidus, then the joint had best be kept stiff. 3. Osseous Ankylosis of the Knee is not of very frequent occurrence. It is usually, if not invariably, the result of traumatic inflammation of the joint. If the limb be straight, no operation -will be ad’^isable ; if it be lent, so that the patient cannot put the foot to the gTound, the only remedy will be an operation. Ehea Barton, of Philadelphia, in 1835, proposed an operation for restoring the straight position of the limb in cases of complete osseous anlvylosis of the knee-joint with angular deformity. The proceeding consists in excisino- a wedge-shaped pieee of the shaft of the femim above the condyles, not including the whole diameter of the bone, then fracturing the undivided portion, and so bnnging the limb into a straight jiosition. Birch, of New York, in 1844, imdificd this operation by sawing out a wedge-shaped portion, consisting of the condyles of the femur, the patella, and the head of the tibia. According o bross, these two operations have been done in all in 21 cases, of Avhich 4 jiroyed fatal by pyaimia. In one case, that of Eeil, the femoral artery had to be tied for secondary hemorrhage from the popliteal on the fifteenth day • but the patient made au excellent recovery with an useful limb. Brainard of Uiicago, in 1854, proposed a simple and less severe method than either of the abme, tor the remedying of angular osseous aiilcylosis of the knee. It con- sisted m drilling the femur subcutaneously and then fracturing the bone rtiis opeiation Avas first done by Pancoast in 1859, and since then has been snccess u y practised by Bramard, Gross, and others, Avho have extended it to "'tI of fto patcnr The drill that is used .for this operation consists of a steel shaft 4^ inchesDEFORMITIES. !74 Fig. 533.—Drill for Ankylosed Joint. —- Fig. 532.—Drill for Aiilcylosed Knee. long, fitted M-ith a solid and rounded handle (Fig. 532). The point is J-th of an inch in breadth, and has on each side an olfiiqne groovcVith cutting’‘edo-es, so that it acts as a gouge as ivell as a drill. The interior of the" obliterated articulation is reached by making an incision about half an 'inch long on the outer side of the limb, at the line of juncture betn'een the condyles of the femur and the tibia. The drill is then Avorked through, until its end can be felt under the integuments on the oppo- site side of the limb. The instrument must noAV be worked in such a manner as to break down the osseous adhe- sions between the femur and the tibia on the one hand, and the patella on the other. The patella is sometimes best loosened by using the drill as a leA’e;’. When the bones have been sufiiciently perforated in different directions, the limb must be extended, AA'hen the re- maining osseous connections AviU give way Avith a cracking noise. The wound in the integument is then closed Avith silver sutures and col- lodion, and the limb laid on a pilloAV. In three or four days it may be put in a McIntyre splint, and gradual extension practised, the soft parts posteriorly sloAvly yielding. Bony union wiU then take place ; but it is a decided advantage Avhen the limb is stiff for the knee not to lie quite straight, but slightly flexed, so that the leg may be about an inch .shorter than the opposite limb. This operation, it aauU be seen, is in many respects superior to those of Barton and Buck ; for whilst bringing the limb into an equally good position, it does so by a comparatively slight and subcutaneous procedine, unattended by any danger of hEemorrhage or of complications arising from an extensive external Avouud. The nine cases in which it has been done were all successful. These various perforating operations appear hitherto to haA’e been confined to the knee-joint. But there can be little doubt that they might advantageously bo extended to other joints, Avhen affected by osseous ankylosis, more particu- larly in the elbow and the hip. In angular conti'action of the knee-joint AAith dislocation of the tibia backwards, Volkmann has improved the condition of the limb and materially coivected the deformity, by cutting across the femur just aboA'e the condyles, and in one case by doing the same to the tibia just below its head. This he recommends to be done Avith a chisel, the Avoimd being dressed antiseptically. Ankylosis of the knee in the strciifiht ‘posihon interferes comparatively little Avith the utility of the limb. It is, hoAA'eA'er, desirable, AA’hen jiracticable, to restore the flexibility of the joint. The possibility of doing this Avill depend on the dcgi’ee of ankylosis. If this be osseous, or even if densely fibrous, little can be done ; but if the rigidity depend chiefly on condensation of the capsule, and the deposit of plastic matter externally to the joint, much may bo375 CLUB-FOOT. ettectctl by the use of properly constructed apparatus. This should be of two kinds : 1. A leg-and-thigh piece securely laced on to the limb, haraig an angular joint opposite the knee, and united posteriorly by a strong baud of vuFcanised India-rubber, the elastic tension of which is constantly striving to overcome the straightened lunb by flexing it backwards ; and 2, a similar apparatus, with rack-and-pinion, instead of elastic, by which the knee can be screwed baek once at least in the day. Ankylosis of the knee in the angular gjos'iHon fonvards, so that the leg is bent upwards upon the thigh, is very rare. Indeed, I am acquainted with only three preparations illustrating this deformity—one in the museum of University College, one in that of St. Thomas’s Hospital, and another exhibited by Adams to the Pathological Society, from a limb amputated by Grant, of Canada, in which this condition occiuTcd in a young man as a consequence of a wound of the joint some years preUously. Club-Foot.—Defonnities of the foot may either affect one or both of the •extremities. They may be congenital or acquired, and may occur in either sex, but appear to be more common amongst boys than girls. There are fom* primary varieties of club-foot, and two secondary ones. Of the fom- primarg forms, in two the deformity is in the antero-posterior direction, in the sense of flexion and of extension: Talipes Equinus, in which the heel is drawn up and the toes pointed downwards ; and its antithesis. Talipes Calcaneus, in which the heel is pointed downwards and the foot and toes drawn up. In the remain- ing two forms the deformity is lateral, the foot being adducted and twisted inwards in Talipes Varus, and abducted and twisted outwards in Talipes Valgus. The foiu’ primary forms of club-foot correspond with and are dependent on a permanent condition of one or other of the four simple move- ments of Avhich the foot is susceptible at the ankle-joint. Thus in Talipes Equinus the foot is extended, the heel being raised, and the dorsum pointing downwards in a line more or less direct with that of the anterior part of the leg. This is due to permanent contraction of those muscles that are inserted into the tendo Achillis. In Tahpes Calcaneus the foot IS draAATi up and the heel is depressed, so that the dorsum fonns an angle more or less acute Avith the front of the leg. Here the tibialis anticus is the muscle chiefly at fault. In Talipes Varus the foot is adducted forcibly, and the inner side of the sole raised sometimes to a right angle Avith the ground ; this is due principally to the action of the tibialis posticus and tibialis anticus’ and m Tahpes Valgus we have the converse, abduction of the foot, and raising of Hie outer side of the sole, due to the action of the peronei muscles. Besides these four primaiy forms, there are two secondary varieties of club- loot ; Talipes Equino-varus, in which the heel is raised and the foot di-awn imvai-ds; and Talipes Calcaneo-valgus, in which the heel is drawn doAATi 10 oot tmned out. I he Talipes Eguinus and Varus are commonly associated, because in these forms the flexor and adductor muscles, A'iz., the s rong muscles of the calf and the tibiahs posticus, those that are supplied by the posterior tibial nerve, are contracted. The Talipes Calcaneus and Valms are associated because in these the extensor and the peroneal muscles, those supplied by the peroneal nerve, are the seat of contraction.

In such instances as these, electricity hecoines an important adjunct to the more directly surgical and mechanical treatment. In infants with talipes, Sayre begins treatment at once, as soon as possible after birth, by drawing the foot into position. When this is done, it becomes quite white and bloodless. The traction must then be discontinued, ljut may be resumed again in a very short time, and so repeated. After a time the limb may be fixed in proper position by the application and traction of plaisters; and thus if the tahpes be not cm’ed, it may very early in life be much ameliorated and rendered more fit for treatment. Pathological Changes.—On dissecting a foot affected by talipes, it will be seen that but little alteration has taken place in the condition of the bones. In some preparations of this kind which are in the University College Museum, these are nearly in a normal condition (Figs, 535, 538). Indeed, in talipes equinus and calcaneus, they are scarcely if at all altered ; but in talipes varus, if of old standing, the astragalus wiU generally be found atrophied, more particularly about its head, which may be somewhat twisted, and the scaphoid and cuboid bones wiU be seen to have undergone similar changes. The hga- ments are necessarily somewhat altered in shape, being lengthened on the convexity, and shortened on the concavity of the foot; the direction of the tendons is altered, and the muscles, not only of the foot, but of the leg and thigh, are generally atrophied from disuse, so that the limb in old cases is withered and shortened ; indeed, so great an incumbrance may it occasionally become under these circumstances, that amputation of the leg may be insisted on by the patient, and “with propriety be performed by the Surgeon. Talipes Equinus is cha- racterised by elevation of the heel, and tension of the tendo Achillis, In slight cases the heel may merely be raised a few lines above the ground, and it will be found on exa- mination that it cannot be bent forwards to an acute or even to a right angle with the leg. In severe cases the foot may be extended in nearly a straight line ■with the leg, and the patient v'alks on his toes, which are placed at a right angle to the foot (Figs. 534, 535). In this deformity there is no lateral displacement. According to Tamplin, it is never congenital. It most commonly arises from disturbance of the nel^ous system during teething. In adults, as Avell as in children, it may come on from some disease, such as an abscess in the calf of the leg, by hich the Fig. !)M.—Tiilipeis Equinus.

It is the most important, and at the same time the simplest in itself, of all the fonns of club-foot; it commonly complicates the varus. The Treatment consists in clividmg the tenth Achilhs, and bringing the heel ■well down. . . . , The tendo Acliillis is best divided about an inch above its insertion into the os calcis. The patient should bo laid prone ; the Siugeon, gTasping the foot, extends it forcibly, so as to thi-ow out the tendon in good relief, and make it tense; he then slides a tenotome beneath it, and cuts slowly through it from beneath upwards, bearing well upon the foot; ..as the division proceeds, he will hear 'the tendon cracking as its fibres are sirccessively cut through. The divi- sion should not be made from above doAvnwards, as the posterior tibial artery or its maUeolar branches might readily be wounded. Talipes Calcaneus is an extremely rare variety of club-foot. In it the heel is depressed, the toes and anterior part of the foot bemg elevated (Fig. 53G) ; it is usually, I believe, congenital—in one case, however, that of a girl twelve years of age, it was acquired. It arises from contraction of the extensor tendons. Treatment.—In order to bring down the foot, the tibialis anticus, the ex- tensor communis, the extensor poUicis, and the peroneus tertius tendons, may all require to be di'^ided as they pass over the dorsum ; a straight splint should then be applied, and the foot dra-wn down to it. A minor degree of this afiection consists in a peculiar projection upwards of one or two of the toes, associated with some tension of the extensor tendon ; by dividing this, and keeping the foot on a flat splint, the deformity may commonly be corrected. In some cases, however, the toe is so prominent, and the contiguous ones are squeezed under it in such a manner, that the foot is completely crippled, and amputation of the displaced digit is required in order to restore the utihty of the member. Talipes Varus.—In this deformity the foot is twisted inwards, and the inner side of the sole is raised, and the sole is contracted ; the patient Avalk- ing on the outer side of the foot, where the skin covering the tarsal end of the fifth metatarsal Iroue often becomes excesswely dense and firm, and a bursa occasionally forms (Figs. 537, 538). In most cases there is some elevation of the heel, the afiection partaking somewhat of the character of talipes equinus. It is the most common form of congenital dcforinity, both feet being found similarly affected ; but it m.ay be non-congenital, dependent on infantile para- lysis of the extensors, and then is often limited to one foot. The Treatment consists in the successive division of the tendons of the tibialis anticus and tibialis posticus, Avhich are the muscles principally at fault. After these have been cut across, the tendo Achillis should be divided ; but its Fig. 536.—Taliiie.s Calcaneus.DEFORMITIES. 378 section should he made last, as it steadies the foot, and thus facilitates the di^■ision of the tibial tendons.

Unless erreat care be taken in cutting through the tendo Achillis, there is also some- S of "ou^^^^ arteiT ; as, in bad cases of varus, these two structures he- nearlv parallel to one another, the tendo Achillis being drawn out of the median line towards the inner ankle. Indeed, in one instance I have seen the posterior tibial arteiy punctured during the division of this tendon, or rathei in an attempt to divide some tense bands that lay beneath it; the bleeding, which was veiw free and in a full jet, was however, readily stopped by pressure,, no bad consecpiences resulting. The proper plan of treatment ^Uien such an accident occurs, is, when the artery is merely punctured, to cut it completely across, and then to apply firm pressime, by means of a pad and bandage, over the bleeding orifice. Tamplin states that he has seen no iU effects follow this accident. If a circumscribed false aneun'sm form, it must be laid open, the clots turned out, and the vessel tied. Uo extension of the foot should be practised for some time in such cases, lest the coagulum be disturbed. In ordmary cases of varus, after a lapse of four or five days, Scai’pa’s or Little’s shoe, or Aveling’s talivert (Fig. 540), a most ingenious and useful in- strument, allowing every movement necessary in club-foot, may be applied ; or the foot may be well abducted by means of a wooden splint, fixed to the outer side of the leg, and provided with pegs, so placed that the toes can be drawn up, and the foot well tiu-ned out, by rollers and tapes attached to them. rig. 540.—Aveling’s Talivert. , Talipes Valgus—Plat or Splay Foot.—Is the antithesis to varus. In it there is a tendency in the first instance to obliteration of the arch of the in- c step, so that the sole becomes perfectly flattened ; and, as the disease advances, 3 a tendency to eversion of the foot usually takes place (Fig. 541). When it J has advanced to this extent, the toes and anterior part are often somewhat ^ raised, so as to constitute the variety termed Calcaneo-valgus. In talipes L valgus the ligaments of the sole of the foot, which bind the bones together so I as to form the arch, are weakened and elongated, and the peroneal and extensor tendons are commonly tense. In the more advanced cases, the foot becomes everted at the calcaneo-cuboid and astragalo-scaphoid articulations, and the head of the astragalus projects inwards, being as it were partially , dislocated from the scaphoid. This being pressed upon, is often a source of ,, much pain. Valgus is not so ft-equent a form of club-foot as the other ^ varieties. It commonly affects only one extremity, being often met within380 DEFORMITIES. Fig. 541.—Talipes Valgus. young adults, as tlie consequence of over-fatigue of the foot from long-continued standing, and from the habit of sliding the left foot in walking, or twisting it, so as to press upon the inner side. When both feet are everted, there is usually knock-knee as well; and then this affection is met with at a much earlier period of life. Treatment.—In the earlier stages of acquired talipes valgus in young adults, more particularly in young Avomen, the deformity may often be remedied by putting the patient under the influence of chloro- form, forcibly draAving the foot iiiAvards so as to overcome the tension of the peronei muscles, fixing it in a Dupuytren’s sphnt, and afterwards restoring the arch of the foot by a convex sole in the shoe. In the more confirmed cases, the treatment consists in the division of the tendons of the peroneus longus and brevis, behind the outer ankle ; and of that of the extensor communis on the dorsum. Scai’pa’s shoe may then be applied, and the arch of the foot restored by wearing a pad under the sole for some considerable time. In Talipes Calcaueo-valgus the projection of the heel backwards is obliterated, and the outer side of the foot curved round towards this, so that the little toe ap- yoroaches the point of the heel. It is not a congenital affection; and, as it commonly arises from a partially paralysed state of the gastrocnemius, the treatment is not very satisfactory. Hollow Club-foot.—As in the hand, the interossei not only move the toes laterally, but poAverfully flex the first phalanges, at the same time that they extend the tAvo last. In paralysis of the interossei, and of the short flexor, and the adductor of the great toe, the toes take the constant position of a claw, i. e., the fii’st phalanges are extended upon the metatarsal bones, and the last two phalanges flexed upon the first under the influence of their antagonists the extensors of the first and last phalanges. These deformities are often complicated by paralysis or atrophy of some of the muscles of the leg, giving rise to various forms of club-foot. There is a form of deformity of the foot, usually cougenital, and not uncommon, the origin of AA'hich has remained unknOAAm up to the pre- sent time. This is a variety of club-foot wliich Ducheuue calls “holloAV claAv-foot,” resulting from atrophy or paralysis of the interossei, and of the adductor and short flexor of the great toe. The accompanying diagram (Fig. 542) shows, 1st, that the first phalanges are extended almost to the point of being subluxated upon the head of the meta caqml bone, Avhilst the last phalanges are flexed upon the first and foim thus <i claw; 2nd, that the curve of the plantar arch is considerably incieased. ic origin of this “ grille pied creux ” is as folloAVS.HOLLOW CLUB-FOOT. 381 then the t-nrve of "the plantar arch becomes increased and the plantar fascia shortened ; then certain articulations and their ligaments become defoi-med as in all clnb-feet.” The mechanism is exactly the same as that of the similai disease in the hand. . „ , , ^ i i This disease makes standing and walking very painful when too iirolonged ; for this reason, that from the position of the toes and from the increased arch of the foot, the whole pressure in walking is borne upon the heel and upon the skin covering the unnaturally prominent heads of the metatarsal bones, which latter becomes tender in consequence, especially that over the. In the case fi'om which the drawing Avas made, the disease was congenital, but did not trouble the patient till he was ten years old. When he Avas apprenticed, a long Avalk ahvays gave him pain, and at last he aaus obhged to lay himself up about one Aveek in eveiy month to get rid of his pains. Both feet were affected, but the left much less than the right. By galvanic exami- nation, irritability was found to be entirely lost in the right interossei and very much diminished in the left. The disease is always accompanied by a tendency to talipes equino-varus, “ that is to say, the flexion of the foot upon the leg during walking is incom- plete, and during this flexion of the foot the tibialis anticus (flexor adductor) has a predominance of action over the extensor communis digitorum (flexor and abductor of the foot); or in other Avords, diu’ing flexion, the sole of the foot is turned slightly inAA'ards and the dorsum outAvards.” However, by a careful examination, we And there is really no talipes equinus nor Aveakness in the muscle producing flexion with abduction. This is accounted for by con- sidering the imfavourable conditions in which the long extensor of the toes is jdaced after paralysis of the interossei. The inferior attachment of this muscle is upon a movable point, the posterior and superior extremity of the second phalanx. The tendency to extension is counteracted by the interossei, which sen-e to give a fixed point for the extensor longtis digitorum to act from, Avhen flexing the foot at the ankle. But when these muscles are paralysed, the attachment of the extensor communis digitorum becomes very movable, and AA’c then see at the moment of flexion of the foot upon the leg, that the first phalanges are draAA'u back even more than before upon the metatai’sal bones, at the same time depressing the heads of these bones. The action of the long- extensor as a flexor and abductor of the foot is thus much AA'cakened, and this leads to a predominance in the action of the tibialis anticus (flexor and adduc- tor of the loot), in consequence of Avhich a mild form of A'arus is produced accompanied by some raising of the heel, due to imperfect flexure of the ankle-joint. fl'’o sum up: this variety of holloAV foot (pied creux) is produced by an exaggerated and continued action of the extensors of the first phalanges of the toes—extensor communis digitorum and extensor proprius pollicis, IblloAV- gi’eat toe.DEFORMITIES. 382 ing on a Aveaknoss or leebleness of their antagonists—the interossei, adductor, 5Uid short flexor of the gi'eat toe. Consequently any excess of action of these same extensor muscles, Avhatever may be its cause, ought to produce exactly identical results. The knowledge of this fact explains the origin of the holloAved claAv-foot that AA'e see produced in talipes equinus, Avhen the long extensor of the toes has pre- served its voluntary contractility; and it Avould be as well here shortly to con- sider the cause of the alteration in the foot in talipes equinus. As soon as the talipes commences to oppose the flexion of the foot upon the leg, the opposing muscles act AAith increased vigoim to prevent the deformity. This leads to an ■abnormal extension of the first phalanges of the toes (to AA'hich the extensor longus and extensor pollicis are attached), and ultimately to a subluxation of these phalanges upon the dorsal surfaces of the heads of the metatarsal bones. Every attempt at flexion then depresses the heads of the metatarsal bones into the sole of the foot, so increasing the plantar arch. This is most marked in the great toe. The tonic force of the antagonists to the extensors is unable to withstand the exaggerated action of the long extensors. That the mechanism here given is correct, may be shoAra by the foUoAA'ing fact. In a Avell marked case of a patient affected with a “ hollow claw-footed equinus ” (griffe pied creux ^quin), we should see that any attempt to flex the foot at the ankle leads only to further extension of the toes, which become draAvn back over the heads of the metatarsal bones, pressing them down and increasing the arch of the foot. Hence, so far from any raising of the extremity of the foot taking place, it is rather depressed. The Treatment of this condition must be conducted on tAAm principles : 1. The stimulation of the paralysed interossei, adductor, and short flexor of the toe by means of faradisation ; and 2. The division of the tendons of those muscles which by their tonic contraction maintain and increase the deformity. Those Avhich I have usually found it necessary to divide are the extensor of the gTeat toe, the tendo Achillis, and in addition to these a very tight band of the inner diAUsion of the plantar fascia. The Scarpa’s shoe that is used after the opei’ation should have hinges across the middle and be provided Avdth a rack-and-pinion moA’ement, so that the depressed heads of the meta- tarsal bones may be raised by the anterior half of the sole. Contraction of One Toe is not of unfr-equent occurrence. In this complaint the proximal phalanx is either on its normal level or slightly draAATi up; the two distal ai-e bent doAvn at an acute angle, the apex of AA'hich is formed by the articulation of the first with the second. This contraction more commonly affects the second toe, is often symmetrical in the tAvo feet, and is frcquently a souice of groat ineonvenience, and even permanent lameness. It appears to be di;e to contraction of the digital prolongation of the plantar fascia, and is best Congenital Hyiiertropliy of Toes and Foot. Fig. 543.—I’lantai- Aspect.

Supernumerary and Webbed Toes are sometimes met vdth. It is com- paratively seldom, however, that any operative interference is required in these cases. Should it be, the remarks that have been made at pages 3C4 and 360, in reference to the treatment of these conditions in the hand, are ec[ually applicable here. Congenital Hypertrophy of the Toes and Foot, as represented in Figs. 043 and 044, occasionally occurs. This malformation is of necessity incimahle. Weak Ankles not uncommonly occur in rickety children ; the ligaments being relaxed, the joints appearing to be swollen, and the child being unable to Avalk or stand without great difficulty. In these circumstances, attention to the state of the general health, douching with salt water, with the applica- tion of an elastic India-rubber bandage round the ankle, or the use of light iron supports, will be found most useful.DISEASES OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 384 DISEASES OF KEGIONS. CHAPTER LV. DISEASES OF THE HEAD AHD NECK. DISEASES OP THE SCALP AND SKULL. The Scalp is subject to all those surgical diseases that affect the common integument of the body. But it is more than any other part of the surface liable to two diseases, viz., Atheromatous and Nmvus Tumour. These have already been so fuUy treated of in Volume I. (Atheroma, p. 737, and Nsevus, pp. 759 and 934) that their description here would lead to needless repetition. There is one form of disease pecuhar to the scalp which has not yet been mentioned, viz., the Pachydermatous Tumoiu*. Pachydermatous Tumour of the Scalp.—This disease, of extremely rare occurrence, was first described by John Bell. It was first named and fully described by Valentine Mott as Pachyclermatocdc, more recently by Virchow as Fibroma Malluscum. The accompanying cut (Fig. 545), taken from a patient whilst in America, who was aftenvards successfully oper- ated on by W. Stokes, in Dubhn, gives a good representation of the disease. These tumoui’s are neither painful nor dangerous, but their weight and the deformity oc- casioned by them render their removal desirable. Treatment.—The removal of this tiuuoiu may be effected by Fig. 545.—Padiydurmatoiis Tumour of Scalp. ligature 01’ the knife. Pollock has successfully extirpated one by the former, W. Stokes by the latter method. But the operation is not ivithout danger. In Stokes’s case the htcmorrhage was described as tenific, and had to be aivested by the cauteiy, nearly costing the patient his life. Stokes states that in the whole course of his experience he had never seen such copious and uncontrollable “ weeping ” hannorrhage ; it came from every point of the cut surface.MENINGOCELE AND ENCEPIIALOGELE. 385 Pungus of tlie Dura Mater.—Sometimes ^yithout external or apparent cause, at other times in consequence of a blow or fall, a Fungous Tumour grows from some part of the dura mater, usually on the top of the head or one of the parietal regions. As it increases in size, it produces absorption of the skull coverino- it; the bone becomes thin and expanded, and crackles like parch- ment on pressure, sometimes not being raised above its proper level, brrt more usually being pushed up by the pressure of the growth beneath, which at last protrudes rrnder the scalp. More usually, this perforation of the skull is gradual; but in some cases it woirld appear to have been sudderr, the first intimation that the patient had of disease being the preserree of a tumour- under the scalp. ‘\\Hren the skull is perforated, the sharp edges of the circular opening can be distirrctly felt; and the tirmoiu- which protrudes prrlsates dis- tinctly, as may be proved both by the finger and the eye. SynnAoms.—Symptoms of cerebral distru’bance—double vision, loss of sight, deafiress, or epileptic fits, with fixed pain in the head—usually precede for a considerable time the external appearance of the tumoirr. In some rare cases, no such symptoms have indicated the existerree of intracranial disease ; and the first evidence of the disease has beerr the srrdden protrusion of a pulsating tumour through the skull. If the tumoiu- be compressed, egg-shell cracking of the expanded and thinned cranial bones will be felt, and, if attempts be made to push it back under the bones, giddiness, syncope, and convulsions are produced. As the disease makes progress, death from paralysis and coma supervenes. Treatment.—The result of the treatment of fungus of the dura mater is not vei-y satisfactoi-y^; yet, as the disease appears to be almost of necessity fatal if left to itself, sonaething should be attempted—not, however, until the tumoiu- has fairly appeared thi-ough the bones. The scalp covering it should be turned back by a crucial incision, and the tumour exposed. The aperture in the skull through which it is protruded may then, if necessary, be enlarged by the use of the trephine or Key’s saw, so as to lay bare the fuU extent of the timioiu, which must then be carefrilly dissected away fr-om the diua mater. Fungus of the Skull may occur. At first it closely resembles the disease just described ; it difiers fr-om this, however, it being devoid of pulsation, and incapable of being pushed back. It appears to spring fr-om the diploe of the skull, and may probably be of a myeloid, sarcomatous, or encephaloid character, sometimes secondary to primaiy deposits of a like nature elsewhere. In other cases It appears to be simply vascular, in structure resembling the pulp of a red goosebeny or a broken-down mulberiy. In a case of this kind, which I had an oppOTtunity of seeing many years ago, the gi-owth was successfullv removed by B. Phillips. Hernia Cerebri, arising from wound or ulceration of the dura mater, has been already described (Vol. I., p. 550). Congenital Hernia of the Membranes of the Brain is sometimes met mth m the form of Meningocele or of Encephalocele. In the former sibstancc, riie diagnosis betivocii these two conditions is geiicrnlly diflicnlt ■ and IS of bttlo practical ioiportancc. The disease is tisnSlj speeM; Md! c c386 DISEASES OF THE HEAD AND NECK. Vi. Laurence finds that, of 80 instances in which it occurred, 21 were males, 18 females ; that the protrusion may vaiy fi’om the size of a pea to that of a timionr exceeding the child’s head; and that the occiput is its chief seat—of 70 cases, 53 being in this situation. The hernia may occur at any of the nnossi- fied points of the skull; and has even been observed, in a case described by Inchtenberg, to protrude from the base of the skull through the mouth. In 0 instances, the subjects of this malformation reached an adult age ; in all the remaining cases they died eai’ly, or were still-born. Surgery offers little in these cases ; though in one instance Paget used injection of iodine with success; and in another, where sloughing of a portion of the tumour was taking place, Annandale applied a ligature to the peduncle, and removed the tumour, the child recovering completely in spite of an attack of measles. In another case, the portion of brain was successfully sliced off, the patient surviving. Tapping the Head.—It occasionally happens in childi-en afflicted with acute hydrocephalus, and sometimes, though more rarely, in cases of the chronic form of the disease, that the distension of the head and the compression of the brain by the intracranial accumulation of fiuid thi'eaten immediately the life of the patient. In these circumstances, the only chance of life is the evacuation of the serum by tapping. This is best done by means of a fine trochar pushed in through the coronal suture, about midway down. The point of the instru- ment should be directed inwards and backwards, so as to penetrate the lateral ventricle, and thus to evacuate a portion of the contained serum. This should be done very gTaduaUy, so as not to disturb the circidation through the brain. After a moderate quantity of fluid has been withdrawn, the small aperture should be closed ■with a strip of plaster, and, if necessary, an elastic bandage should be applied round the head so as to compress and to confine the bones : this is more especially necessary in chronic hydrocephalus. It is scarcely necessary to observe that the prognosis in these cases is not of a very favourable character, In chronic hydrocephalus the operation can scarcely be expected to succeed, as all the structures, osseous as well as cerebral, have undergone organic changes. In the cicide forms of hydrocephalus, immediate rehef of the coma ensues on the withdrawal of the fluid, and there is just the possibility of the evacuation of the fluid permanently reheving the com- pression of the brain, whilst the small punctiue is not hkely to add to the mischief that is going on in the interior of the cranium. DISEASES OF THE EAE. Inflammation of the External Ear, Otitis, or Ear-ache, is usually a rheumatic affection occm-ring in debilitated individuals, and is characterised by intense pain, generally associated with hemicmnia ; a kind of combination, indeed, of inflammation and neuralgia. This pain is much increased at mg , by warmth of the bed, and is generally accompanied by throbbing and noises in the ear. The Treatment, at first antiphlogistic, generally and locally, may advantageously, after a time, give place to quinine and mdide ot with the extei nal application of aconite.

To relieve this, leeching, poidticing, and early lancing will be required. Otorrhoea.—This is a fetid discharge of a muco-purulent character, usually occurring' in strumous children, especially dui’ing dentition, and often asso- ciated \\-ith enlarged glands under the angle of the jaw. It may be of three kinds: 1, proceeding simply from the mucous surface of the external ear, apparently depending on subacute inflammation of it; 2, proceeding fr-om the middle ear through a perforated membrana tympani, the mischief extending to and the discharge Iprocceding from the mastoid cells; 3, connected with necrosis of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, associated with disease and destruction of the tympanum, and necessarily of the internal ear. These discharges are especially apt to supervene in measles and scarlatina. Their Froffmil's and Treatment will depend on their precise seat. When occurring from the external meatus only, however tedious, they are never dangerous. Attention to the state of the general health and to that of the teeth, ivith the use of lead, chlorinated or carbolised injections, will usually arrest them. When occiuTing from the middle ear, through a perforated tympanum, they are far more intractable and also more serious. Not only wiU hearing be impaired to a gi’eater or less extent, but they may continue for an indefinite time, resisting aU means of treatment. If they proceed from the mastoid cells and the internal ear they are far more serious, and the patient is exposed to a double danger. The dura mater covering the bone may become in- flamed, and, the membranes at the base of the brain becoming imtated by the extension of the morbid action to them, convulsions, coma, and death usually at last result. This is especially the case when the petrous portion is the seat of disease. When the mastoid process is chiefly affected, phlebitis of the sinuses and the cerebral veins ensues, and pytemia is developed, which proves fatal. Special Affections of the External" Ear.—The external ear is occasion- ally the seat of special affections; thus in idiots. Hypertrophy of this structm’e is sometimes met with; and in gouty subjects. Tophi, or Gouty Concretions^ are occasionally deposited in it. Paget, Brack, and Yanzetti have described a rihrous Tumour that occasionally fonns in the lobule of the ear from the irritation produced by piercing it, and as “ one of the penalties attached to- the barbarism of ear-rings.” These tumours are semi-malignant, like the- warty growths of cicatrices ; and, after excision—their only treatment—are somewhat apt to retm-n. Bloody Tumours, or Hsematomata, are occasionally developed in the external ear of the insane or idiots. They may attain a large size, and are often multiple. Unless they become inflamed, I think it better to leave them untouched, when they "will gi’adually be absorbed. If inflamed, they must be opened. Concretions in the Meatus.—We not uncommonly find that the meatus Ixjcomes blocked up by accumulations of wax, dark, indurated, and pipie-like, or foiming balls and masses that lie in contact with the membrana tympani. These chiefly occur in individuals of the bilioso-phlegmatic temperament, and are a common source of temporary deafness among young people. They not only materially impair the sense of hearing, but are very apt to give rise to noises in c c 2DISEASES OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 388 the head, and to crackling sensations on opening and shutting the mouth. Their presence is best ascertained by examination with a well-constructed ear-speculum ; that introduced by Toynbee, of a double-convex shape, is the most useful. The Treatment of these concretions consists in softening the wax by the introduction of a little glycerine into the ear for a few nights, and then repeatedly washing out the meatus by the injection of tepid soap and water, or water containing a httle soap-liniment, thrown in with a large syringe ; as the fluid regurgitates from the membrana tympani, it will at length bring away dark and hardened ceruminous masses. Polypi are met with, situated deeply on one side of the meatus. They are usually hard and fleshy-looking, though sometimes soft and gelatinous, as in the nose ; sometimes pediculated, but at others situated on a broad base. They produce serious inconvenience by obstructing the external ear, and require to be twisted off by means of forceps, or, if too firmly fixed for this, cut off with scissors or a wire snare ; the surface fr’om which they spring should then be touched with nitrate of silver, so as to prevent a reciuTence of the growth. Thickening of the Cuticle.—Occasionally the cuticle of the external ear, and that covering the membrana tympani, becomes thickened and indurated, assuming a dull white appearance : this condition may give rise to some amount of deafness. In these circumstances, glycerine, citrine ointment, or solution of nitrate of silver, will be extremely useful in restoring the healthy action of the integument of the part. Deafness.—It is not my intention to enter into the general pathology of the various kinds of dea&ess, nor to discuss its causes. It may be stated generally, however, that it may arise from obstruction of the external ear fr’om disease ; from ulceration and perforation of the membrana tympani; from various inflammatory affections, chiefly of a subacute and chronic character, of the internal and middle ear ; fe’om paralysis of the acoustic nerve, either local or dependent on cerebral lesions ; and lastly, from obstruction in the Eusta- chian tube, or fi’om disease of the throat. Toynbee has especially shown that many cases of so-caUed “nervous” deafness, together wth singing, ringing, boihng, and other noises in the head, are in reality dependent upon chi’onic inflammatory affections of the internal and middle ear ; and that the treatment best adapted for their ciu’e consists in constitutional and local means of an alterative and antiphlogistic character. DISEASES OF THE NOSE AND CHEEKS. Ckronic Catarrh, in the form of a thin wateiy mucous dischai’ge, lasting, for many months, is occasionally met with, more particularly in yoimg women,] independently of any structural disease of the mucous membrane. Ihe ment of this affection consists in the employment of tonics and means calculated to strengthen the system generally, and the local application of astringents^ such as tannin, chloride of zinc, &c. But under any plan of treatment tlm affection is apt to prove rebellious. • i r t. A very Fetid Discharge ft’orn the nose will occasionally occur ni dclica t and unhealthy children while cutting their teeth, and may contuuie fc several years. It is not attended by ulceration of the mucous membraneEPISTAXIS. 389 but, auDcai-s to be due to some modification of the nasal mucus, connected -svith protracted and faulty dentition. The Treatment should be directed rather to the teeth and stomach than to the nose. ^ Epistaxis, or bleeding from the nose, is veiy common in childi-en and m youn^^ people about the age of puberty, more particularly m girls, antecedently to the mcnstnial period; it may either be active or passive, but is most usuaUy dependent on congestion of the mucous membrane. But in the adult it is more serious, and it may then be associated vnth and dependent on two very opposite conditions—either on a state of plethora ivith tendency to cerebral cono-estion, or on an ansemic and cachectic state, in which the blood is thin, and docs not coagulate readily. In the first condition the epistaxis is often con- nected with° congestion of the liver, and, when occurring in the young and plethoric, it is often a salutary rehef to the system. But when occnriing in cachectie and ansemic people, more particularly in persons advanced in years, it becomes of very serious moment; and in such circumstances the loss of blood may be so continuous and copious that, imless active means be adopted, a fatal termination may ensue, the hiemorrhage being truly arterial. When epistaxis proves fatal, it is by its constant recurrence. In these cases, I believe, the nasal hmmoiThage is always associated with a broken-down and unhealthy state of the blood, dependent upon chronic visceral mischief, especially disease of the kidneys and liver. The worst and most intractable cases that I have seen have been connected with hepatic disease and jaundice. Treatment.—Epistaxis must not be treated simply as a local disease of the nose. It^is usually only a symptom of some constitutional condition that requires remedying before the hemorrhage can be expected to cease. Hence it is of the first importance to treat on ordinary medical principles those states of plethora or cachexy -with which it may be associated, or those conditions of disease of fiver or of kidney that are met with in persons suffering from it. In young people, otherwise healthy, and in slighter cases, epistaxis may com- monly be arrested by the employment of ordinary domestic means, such as the application of cold to the nape of the neck and forehead j and its retmai may be prevented by the use of purgatives, or by attention to the proper regulation of the menstrual function. In plethoric adults the flow should not be too suddenly checked. Should it prove very abundant, dry cupping between the shoulders, and the application of an ice-bag to the forehead, with rest, will be required. In ansemic and cachectic subjects, and in old people, the haemorrhage is often attended by dangerous consequences, and requires the use of active measures for its suppression. In these cases the following plan shoidd be adopted. The head should be raised, an ice-bag applied to the forehead, complete rest and quietude enjoined, and gallic acid in ten-grain doses, or half-drachm doses of the tincture of ergot, administered at frequent intervals. Should the bleeding still be profuse and continuous, the interior of the nose may be sponged out with a solution of perchloridc of iron or tannin. If this do not ^suffice, it will become necessary to plug one or both nostrils. This is best done by means of a plug of prepared sponge, having a quill or a piece of gum catheter passed through it for breathing purposes, and soaked in a solution of per- chloride of iron.I^ISEASES OF TIIE HEAD AND NECK. seriously to obstruct the breathing. I Should, however, the hasmorrhage still continue, the blood forcinc its wav ackwai-ds into the throat, or perhaps being swallowed, the posterfor nares equiie to be plugged as well. This is best done by can-ying a long piece of s rong whip-cord along the floor of the nose through the posterior nares into the pharynx, by means of Bellocq’s sound (Fig. 54C), or, if this be not at hand by threading the cord through an elastic catheter, and can-ying this into the phar^x, then seizing the cord as it appears behind the soft palate, and drawing 1 orwards into the mouth, at the same time that the catheter is taken out of e nostril. In this way the string wiU pass through the nose, roimd the back of the soft palate, into and then out of the mouth (Fig. 547). To the centre 0 be piece of string that hangs out between the lips, a plug of lint, about the size of the first joint of the thumb, or better still, a piece of compressed sponge, shoidd be fii-mly tied; this is then di-awn up into the posterior nares by pulling on the end of the ligatm-e that hangs from the nose, being guided in its passage behind the palate by the fingers introduced into the mouth. When the bleeding has ceased, it may readily be withdrawn by means of the string that hangs out of the mouth. As the epistaxis is very apt to recur, it is a wise precaution, when the plug is removed from behind the palate, to leave a loop of string in the nose and mouth, which may be knotted and fixed by a slip of plaster behind the ear. In this way the plug may, if occasion occur, be readily replaced without the necessity of re-introducing the sound-or catheter through the nose, which is often a troublesome operation. Chronic Thickening of the Schneiderian Membrane.—The mucous 'I membrane of the nose is not unfr-equently chi-onically inflamed, especially in strumous childi-en ; that portion of the membrane covering the turbinate bones becoming thick, soft, and vascular, and projecting like a broad fringe I from their surface. It is usually of a bright red colour, and covered Avith | muco-pus. This swelling at all times produces snuffling and a peculiar intona- I tion of voice, but increases in wet weather, and then may become so great as I391 NECROSIS OF THE NASAL BONES. The Treatment consists in attention to the general health ; more specially to the eradication of the strumous diathesis. Much benefit may also be derived from the local application or injection of astringents, as a strong solution of the nitrate of silver applied by means of a camel’s-hair brush, and sulphate of zinc and oak-bark lotions snuffed up, or injected by means of a proper syringe. In many instances, when the disease occurs in strumous childi’en, change of air will effect the greatest amount of benefit. Abscess occasionally forms either on the mucous membrane or on the septmu, and thus may lead to necrosis of the cartilages and bones, separation of these, flattening of the nose, depression of its bridge, and great deformity. These various forms of abscess, followed by necrosis, are commonly syphilitic, and then are associated with ulcers and a foul and foetid discharge, which has a tendency to cake upon their surface, forming dark and rugged crusts, and constituting the different kinds of Ozeena. The septum may be the seat of chronic ulceration consequent upon the irritation of decayed teeth, producing disease of the antrum, and escape of morbid secretion from this into the cavity of the nose. The Treatment of these conditions must be conducted by the local applica- tion of nitrate of silver, black wash, and the chlorinated lotions ; the general treatment consists usually in the administration of the dilute mineral acids, iodide of potassiixm, and sarsaparfila. Ulcers and Fissures, of a less serious character, though veiy ]3ainful and chronic, often occur at the angle of the ala and septum, or between the ala and tip. Their Treatment consists in touching them from time to time with nitrate of silver, or in the application every night of white precipitate or citrine ointment; at the same time that the general health is attended to, cachexy removed, and the strength restored, by the administration of iron, bai-k, and sai'saparilla. Necrosis not unfrequently ocem-s in the loose bony structures lying in the nasal fossre or in the nasal bones themselves. In these cases the septum nasi participates in the morbid action, and commonly separates or is perforated. ISecrosis may occur in these situations either as the result of syphilis, the abuse of mercury, or from external injmy.

Lipoma is a chronic hypertrophy of the cutaneous and subcutaneous structures, and of the areolar tissue of the nose, forming a large reddish-blue, vascular-looking, soft, tremulous, and lobulated mass, enveloping the end of the nose, and producing excessive deformity of it. There are all degrees of this disease, from mere clubbing of the end of the organ, to the fomiation of a set of pendulous lobular tumours attached to it. The sebaceous glands and crypts appear to be the structures chiefly implicated in this disease. The patient’s appearance may be greatly improved by the removal of these growths. This may be done readily enough by making an incision down the mesial line to the alar cartilages, and then dissecting the lipoma off these on each side ; especial care, however, being taken in doing this not to encroach upon the nostril. This is best avoided by directing an assistant to keep his Anger in it while the dissection is being prosecuted, so that he may warn the Surgeon of the too near approach of the knife. The sm-face is then left to granulate and cicatrise. Lupus and Epithelial Cancer.—The nose is frequently the seat of Lupus and various forms of Epithelial Cancer, many of the deformities of this feature being referrible to this affection ; indeed, lupus may be looked upon as almost specially affecting this organ, destroying one or both alse, the columna, or perhaps the whole of the nose. The consideration of the nature and treatment of these affections in this situation presents nothing special {see Chapter xxxvii. Vol. I.): but the cure of the defoiruities induced by them, which is full of interest to the Surgeon, wiU be considered in detail when we speak of the plastic operations that are practised on the face. Polypus.—Tumoiu’S of very different structines and composition are met with in the nostrils ; and to all of these which possess the common characters of being pendulous and blocking up these passages, the term Polypus is given. Thus Surgeons commonly speak of the Benign, the Soft, the Gelatinous, or Mucous Polyp, as well as the Sarcomatous or Fleshy, and the Malignant Polyp. The term, however, should properly be confined to a soft and pendulous mucous growth ; the fleshy and malignant polypi being mere varieties of fibrous myeloid or encephaloid tumoiu’s, springing from the bones in the nasal fossEe, or fr'om the ethmoidal and sphenoidal cells. The true Mucous Nasal Polyp is a soft, moist, gelatinous tmnour, of a greyish-yellow colour when lodged in the nasal fosste ; but when it descends into the anterior nares, or beyond them, and is exposed to the air, it becomes of a reddish-brown or pmple tint, and somewhat shrivelled on the suiface. It is usually lobulated, pedunculated, or bottle-shaped ; and not very vascular except at the root, Avhere it is permeated by largish thin-waUed vessels that bleed freely on the slightest touch. In structure it is homogeneous, and com- posed of the elements of mucous membrane, covered by ciliated epithelium, the cilia of Avhich may often be seen under the microscope in active movement after the removal of the growth. Occasionally polypi are found, growing from the lower part of the nares, covered with tessellated epithelium. The tumour may grow from any points of the surface of the turbinate and ethmoid bones, and has indeed occasionally, though A'ery rarely, been obsoived to project in o cPOLYPUS OF THE NOSE. 393 nose from tlie frontal sinuses and antrum. Llost frequently it gi’ows from the inferior spongy bone towards the outer side of the nostril, sometimes from the roof of the nares, but never fi-om the septum. The polypi are usually numerous and of all sizes ; as they increase they commonly extend forwards into the anterior nares, but, when lai’ge, they may be seen to reach into the posterior fauces, hanging down behind the palate. Symptoms.—The symptoms occasioned by the presence of nasal polypi depend on their interference with respiration and speech, and on the visual changes which they occasion. The respiration through the affected nostril is impeded, the patient being unable to blow through it when directed to do so, and his speech is thick and nasal. There are snuffing and mucous discharge fi'om the nostril : and all these symptoms are worse in damp than in dry weather. On examining the interior of the nose, by opening the nostril widely with the forceps or nasal speculum (Fig. 548), and then dfrecting the patient to blow down, the lower end of the polyp may be distinctly seen, and, if large, will descend to a level vdth or even beyond the nasal aperture. By the intro- duction of a probe, the size and extent of the tumour, together with the position of its pedicle, may be readily ascertained. As it gi’ows, it impresses changes on the shape of neighbouring hones, producing expansion and flatten- ing of the nose ; it induces caries of the spongy hones ; and, interfering vdth the flow of tears down the nasal duct, occasions a watery state of the eyes, which, together Avith the change of shape in the featiues, and the peculiar' character of voice and re- spiration, enables the Surgeon at once to recognise the nature of his patient’s disease. Polypi chiefly occur in young adults after the age of puberty: but they are not unfrequently met with at later periods of life. Their Causes are very obsciue. Most commonly they are referred either to a blow or to a prolonged catarrh. They are more common in women than in men. Eiagnosis.—\. Mucous nasal polypi may be distinguished from chronic tkichening of the mucous mmnhrane covering the spongy hones, by the absence in the latter of any pedimculated growth around which a probe can be passed, by the florid red character of the thickened membrane, and by the fact that the subjects of this thickening are almost invariably strumous children. 2.

Nasal Spuculuiu.DISEASES OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 394 Treatment,—Tlie spontaneous separation and expulsion of nasal polypi is of rare occiUTonce. I haA'e, however, seen one case in which, after the assiduous use of chloride of zinc injections, a very copious discharge of large sloughy polypoid masses took place from one nostril which had been blocked up by them for many months previously, and fr-om which they had even descended into the pharynx. Nasal polypi may generally be most readily removed by avulsion with forceps ; occasionally, but rarely, when they are very large, with a broad base, and especially Avhen they extend into the throat, they require the application of the ligatiu'e. In removing these growths by the forcejos, instruments of good length but very slender construction should be used,—those generally sold are too thick ; the interior of the blades should be properly serrated, and have a longitudinal groove, so that the root of the tumour may be tightly grasped. The patient should be made to sit on a rather low chafr ; and, as there is generally a good deal of bleeding, a towel should be pinned over his clothes, and a basin placed before him to receive the blood and expectorated matters. The Siu’geon then, having ascertained by the introduction of a probe, or by means of the blades of the forceps, the situation of the pedicle of the polyp, grasps this firmly and puUs it off with a twisting movement of the hand. He proceeds in this manner, testing off rather than puUiug away polyp after polyp, until the whole of the nostril is cleared, which may be ascertained by examination, and by directing the patient to compress the somid and to blow through the affected side of the nose. The bleeding, which is^often very free, stops on the application of cold water. At about the end of a fortnight the patient should be examined again, as it not mifrequently happens that small polypi, which had been prevented from descending into the nares by the presence of the larger ones, now come down and require removal. These procedimes must be had recom’se to from time to time, until all tendency to fresh formations of this kind has ceased. The ligature is chiefly required for those polypi that pass into the pharynx through the posterior nares. They may best be tied by passing a loop of strong whipcord, by means of a double cannula, through the nose ; and then, after expanding the noose round the tumour in the throat, and making it gi’asp its pedicle, knotting it tightly. In some instances the polypi attain a great size, producing absorption of the nasal bones, and of the nasal process of the superior maxilla. In such cases it may be necessary, in order to extract them, to slit up the nose, and clip away with forceps the osseous simface fr'om which they spring. . Naso-ph.ar3rngeal Tumours.—When the tumour, more especially it fibrous or fibro-plastic, hangs down in the phaiynx behind the soft palate, its pedicle may be hgatured by conveying a thread through the nostril by meaiis of a BeUocq’s somid, and attaching to this a loop of silver wire, whi J, as it is withdrawn through the nostril, embraces the base of the tumour. The noose may then be tightened by twisting up the ends of the mre, or by running a silver cannula along them. The intranasal fibrous tumour (sarcomatous or fleshy polyiius) is usua j attached to the posterior part of the nasal septum, descending to the pharjmx It is globular, smooth, fii-m, and has little disposition to bleed or iilceiatc.

Thus it has been met Avith in the pterygo-maxillary fossa, and has been known to pass into the orbit through a hole in its inner AA’all. (See also Chapter LVII.) Malignant Nasal Tumours.—There is a remarkable and as yet unde- scribed, and to mo inexplicable, connexion between the ordinary benign nasal polypus and tumom'S of a sarcomatous, myeloid, or cancerous character, developing as a sequence of the extraction of the polyp in the large cavities and interosseous fissures in the A'icinity of the nares. I have several times seen in chilcben and young adults tumours of the above-mentioned character de- veloping rapidly in the orbit, the sphenoidal cells, or behind the superior maxilla, after the extraction of perfectly and anatomically benign nasal polypi. The questions to be soh'ed are these :—Are these tumours the result of the irrita- tion of the operation of extraction ? or are they the primary disease lying concealed and undeveloped in the deep cavities of the face, the benign nasal jAolyp being secondary in reahty, though more apparent, and consequent on the initation set up by the graver and yet latent tumour ? In whatever way futiue investigators may answer this, the fact remains certain, that a connexion does exist between the two forms of disease. I haA’e several times observed it. Tumours of rapid growth, mah’gnant in their course, (sometimes called malignant jDolypus,) either epithehal, encephaloid, or fibro-plastic, occasionally foim piimaiily in the middle or posterioi* nares. They grow rapidly, with gieat expansion of the bones, much discharge, often intense tensive pain, and bleeding, the htemoiThage being often excessive. They attack children and persons advanced in life. A tumonr of this kind may be developed in different situations. Thus, in some cases, it extends into the pharyiix behind the soft palate ; in others it has a tendency to press against, absorb, and protrude through the nasal or lachrymal bones, occasioning obstruction of the nostril divergence and protrusion of the eyeball, with disturbance of vision, and severe neuralgic pains in the head and face. A soft elastic tumour that projects at the inner side of the orbit, extending into the nose and some httle distance down upon the cheek, absorbing and destroying the bones on which it lies and giving rise to secondary deposits under the angle of the jaw, will soon ow Its true nature.

In this operation there is often free bleeding^ udncb may be an-ested by the actual cautery, and by pledgets of lint soaked in the percbloride of iron, which have the additional advantage of destroying any portions of the tumour left behind in the in-egulai- and cellular cavities of this region. Naso-Orbital Tumours are growths that, commencing in the posterior pait of the nasal fossa or in the ethmoidal cells, perforate eventually the thin imier wall of the orbit and .expand into the interior of that cavity, displacing the eye forwards, downwards, or outwards, in two, sometimes in all three of these directions. Vision is often but little if at aU disturbed. The nostril on the affected side is blocked up by a polypoid growth. But the outline of the superior maxdlla and of the hai-d palate is normal, no pro- jection of the bone, in whole or in part, being perceptible. In fact, the disease and the deformity produced by it occupies a part of the face which is above a hori- zontal line drawn across the cheek on a level with the upper or orbital border of the superior maxdla. The disease always commences primarily in the nose or in the cavities contiguous to it. The extension into the orbit may not occm for many months after its primary development. It occurs at aU periods of life, from early childhood to commencing old age. At first it may present the ordhiary characters of bem'gn nasal polypus. This is removed, recurs rapidly, is again removed, with much haemorrhage, and then the orbital implication is developed. The Diagnosis of the naso-orbital from the naso-pharyngeal tumour may be made by observing the displacement of the eyeball and absence of all tumom* behind the soft palate in the fii’st case ; whilst, in the other, the naso-phai’yn- geal, the orbit is intact, while the upper part of the pharynx is occupied by a morbid growth, and the superior maxilla is possibly pushed bodily forwards or to one side. In the naso-orbital tumom’, the deformity is above the horizontal line of the upper edge of the superior maxilla ; in the naso-pharyngeal, it is below this. The nature of the tumour varies. It is usually a large or small spindle- celled sarcoma, but it may be truly cancerous. 'Treatment.—The operation for the removal of naso-orbital tumom’ may be done as follows. An incision should be made fi’om the nasal process of the superior maxilla directly down along the side and round the ala of the nose, so as to open the nasal cavity. The soft parts on the orbital side of this cut arc then dissected down into the orbit. One blade of a cutting pliers being passed into the nose, the nasal bone is cut through dii’ectly upwards along its outer bordei.NASO-ORBITAL TUMOURS. 397 An oblique cut upwards should then be made across the upper and inner part of the superior maxilla deeply into the orbit, the cut bones uudely separated, and the nose turned completely over to the sound side of. the face. The tumom- at the nasal side of the orbit may now be felt, the eye being held to the outer side and protected with a retractor, without its capsule being opened. The orbital tumour may now be enucleated with the finger and curved scissors. The nostril is then cleared by means of polypus-forceps. The bleeding should be aiTcsted by plugging; and, after all the morbid growth has been fairly extir- pated, the nose should be pushed back and moulded into shape. The soft parts are then brought together Avith a few points of suture. Care must be taken in this, as all similar operations, that blood does not find its way into the trachea. But occasionally the disease has extended into the integuments at the inner angle of the eye. Then the operation becomes more complicated. The fol- loAving cases, operated on by me at University College Hospital, are good illustrations of this operation. The first case was one of the most marked epithelial character, springing -deeply fi*om the ethmoidal cells, passing out through the lachrymal bone and the orbital plate of the superior maxilla into the orbit, blocking up the right nostril, and extending some way down the cheek, overlying the superior maxilla. It was growing rapidly in a woman 44 years of age, and required extensive remoA’al of the bony structm-es in the situation from which it sprang. The next case was one of a woman 64 years of age, in whom a fibro- plastic tumom- developed with great rapidity in the situation of the lachrymal sac, invading the nose and orbit, and destroying the upper and inner part •of the superior maxillary bone. The eye Avas pushed outAvards, the eyelids became impUcated at their nasal third, and an idcerated opening formed over the centre of the tumour. Its growth was attended by very severe tensive pam. The operation consisted in dissecting away the diseased part of the integument, including the nasal third of each eyelid, then tm-nino- doAvn a flap frnm the cheek and cutting away with pliers the osseous stnictures including the inner part of the floor of the orbit, a considerable portion of the superior maxilla, and part of the nasal bones. In order to repair the gap made by the removal of diseased skin at the side of the nose and by the remoA^al of so large a portion of the eyelids, a flap of integument was dissected off the ? aperture, to the edges of which and tL mfrl 1 Pl^ce, and e patient made an excellent recovery.

But sometimes these rhinolites are situated under the mueous membrane. In two cases I have disseeted round calcareous bodies of this kind, of about the size of cherry-stones, from mider the mueous membrane of the ala of the nostril in children. The Frontal Sinuses, though rarely, are occasionally the seat of disease. Abscess may foiTU here, with much pain and expansion, and possibly caries of their anterior wall, attended by the local signs of inflammation and by danger of concomitant inflammation of the membranes of the brain. In such circum- stances it may be proper for the Surgeon to remove by a small trephine the anterior wall of the sinus, and thus give exit to the retained pus. In other instances, again, the anterior waU of the sinus may be necrosed and perforated, the aperture being felt under a puffy tumour of the scalp. Here also the trephine is required. Distension with serous fluid has also been described as having occuired in some cases. There are a few cases recorded in surgical writings, of Polypi springing from these sinuses, and finding their way down into the nose after producing expansion of it and much inconvenience. Here likewise the propriety of trephining and so extracting the morbid mass would have to be considered. Tumours and Ulcers of the Cheeks.—The cheeks are occasionally the seat of Encysted Tumours and Cancerous Growths, either springing from their inner surface, or taking their origin as Lupoid Ulcers on the outside. cases is always to a great extent and often entirely intermittent, ceasing in the interval between meals, and becoming very abimdant during mastication.

If they be attached to, or lie close under, the mucous membrane of the mouth, they may be dissected out fr'om within, without interfering with the cutaneous structures. Cancerous TJlcm's and Tumours, such as is represented in Fig. 550, seldom admit operative inter- ference. Fig. 550.—Cancerous Ulcer of Clieek. Salivary Fistula.—One of the most troublesome sm-gical affections situated in the cheek is Salivary Fistula, occurring in consequence of injury, abscess, or ope- ration, by which the parotid gland or duct has been opened, so as to cause a trickling of sahva through the external aperture- made into it. The flow of saliva in theseDISEASES OF THE LIP. 39f> chronic, operative measures will require to be put in practice. The closure of an old salivary fistula in the cheek is a very troublesome matter. In these cases the Stenonian duct appears to be obstructed or partially closed ; and it is useless to attempt to occlude the opening in the cheek until a proper aperture for the escape of the saliva has been made into the mouth ; the escape of a few drops of saliva through the fistulous opening rendering the attempt to close it completely nugatory. The plan of treatment which I have found to answer best is a modification of Desault’s. It consists in passing a small hydrocele trochar into the fistula in the cheek, pushing this obliquely forwards and inwards into the mouth, as nearly as possible in the direction of the parotid duct, withdrawing the stilet, and then passing a small silk seton through the cannula, so as to bring one end out of the mouth, and the other through the fistula in the cheek. The cannula is then withdrawn, and the seton tied loosely. It should be left in for about three weeks, so as to establish a sinus into the mouth. It is then to be cut and withdrawn, and the sinus in the mouth kept patent by the daily introduction of a probe, by leaving a small piece of gum catheter in it, or, if it show mirch disposition to close, by the introduction of a. laminaria tent. In this way the saliva is diverted from the external opening- and made to flow into the mouth. The external aperture hi the cheek may now be closed by touching its edges with a pointed stick of the nitrate of silver or the galvanic cautery ; or, if large, they may be pared and stitched together. DISEASES OF THE LIPS. Congenital Malformation of the Lips is of common occurrence. Con- genital Contraction, or even complete closure of the orifice of the mouth, has been met with at birth ; such a condition must be remedied, according to cir- cumstances, by the skiU of the Smgeon. By far the most common malforma- tion, however, is the condition termed Hare-lip, which wiU be noticed in detail in the chapter on the Plastic Surgeiy of the Face and Mouth. Hypertrophy to a great extent occasionally occurs in either or in both lips. It is often of an oedematous character, being kept up by the irritation of fissures or cranks ; if so, these must be cured, when the size of the lip will gradually dimmish. Sometimes, however, it becomes permanent, continuino* after the cure of the fissure ; in these circumstances it may be necessaiy to excise an elliptical portion of the mucous membrane of the bp in a horizontal direction, and then to bring the edges together by means of sutures oi- OTceration is not unfrequently met with on the prolabium, frequently of Lrof It is often dependent on a Lrdered ut L of “““only yield to the application of nitiateofsilyer, to proper constitutional treatment, haying for its obiect the Sre™ K adminiLrati® 01 the preparations of arsenic. Encysted and Erectile Tumours.—The lips may be the seat of encysted and erectile tumours, requiring extirpation by the knife or ligatimc. In diJml he should, If possible, avoid cutting through the whole thickness ofDISEASES OF THE HEAD AND NECK. oo the liji; and, if compelled to do so, he must act as will he described in speakin^r ot cancer of this region. (Sec next page.) These gi-owths most frequently occur on the lower lip. ^ Encysted Tumours are usually small and transparent, ivith thin walls con- taining a glairy straw-coloured fluid. These should always be dissected out; mere excision of a portion of the wall being followed by recurrence of the disease. ^ Eiectile Timours of the lip are usually of an active character, and may either be excised, if of moderate extent and implicating the whole thickness of the lip ; or, if of large size and projecting from the mucous surface, they may be safely ligatured (p. 940, Vol. I.) I have had under my care several cases of Ncevus of the upper hp, implicating the whole substance of the part, and have successfully removed them by the repeated application of potassa cum calce. MALiGNAifT Diseases of the Lips.—Not unfrequently Warty Growths and various forms of Ejnthelioma and Cancroid Diseases appear upon the lips. These afiections are not removable by therapeutic means, and require siu’gical interference. The structure of epithehoma has been so fully described at p. 810, Vol. I., that it need not detain us here. The accomj)anying cut is a good illustration of the microscopic characters usually presented by it in the face and lips. Epithelioma of the lip either com- mences as a warty growth, which gradually ulcerates hke the ordinary forms of tubercular lupus ; or it begins as an indm’ated crack or fis- sure, the edges of which have a tendency to spread. The submaxillary glands tend to become involved ; and the disease may eventually prove fatal by the pain, exhaustion, and constitu- tional irritation thus induced. Lip-epithehoma almost invariably occurs in men—I have never met with a case affecting the lower lip of a woman. It is met with after the middle period of life. Of twenty consecutive cases in which I have operated, and of which I have notes, thirteen were above sixty, and six between fifty and sixty years of age ; in one case only did the disease occur under thirty. This disease is at first entirely local, often being induced by some irritation, as by a rugged broken tooth, or by smoking a clay-pipe ; and when removed it does not, I believe, very commonly recur. At least, of the very many patients that have been operated upon at the University College Hospital, I have known but few to return mth a recm- rence of the disease ; I cannot, therefore, but come to* the conclusion that the operation for epithelioma of the lower lip frequently rids the patient permanently of his disease. When return does take place, it is not always in the cicatrix or in the401 epituelioma of the lip. adiacent "lands. I have seen recurrence at the angle of the mouth and inside the cheek^of the side opposite to that on which the primary disease had declared itself and been removed, and this recurrence not till three or four years after the operation. FiK 552 -Extensive Wnrty Epithelioma Fig. 553.-Lines of Incision for Eemo^-ing of the Lip. V-shaped Piece of Lip. When the glands under the jaw are enlarged in this disease, it is a question whether an operation should be done. In some eases, extirpation of the disease and removal of the enlarged glands (provided that the surrounding soft parts be not involved) may be practised if the patient be in a good state of health ; and he will thus be placed in a more favourable condition than before the operation, and will have a better chance of prolongation of life. But in the majority of cases it wiU be wiser not to operate. Opei-ation.—When once the true natm’e of the disease has been ascertained, the operation should be performed with as little delay as possible ; but before it is done, it is weU that any very prominent or broken tooth should be removed, and the tartar cleaned away from the incisors. The operation requires to be somewhat modified, according to the situation and extent of the affection (Fig. 554). If this be tolerably limited, a yshaped cut, extending widely round it, , and carried sufficiently low to include any indurated prolongation of the ab- I sorbents, should be practised ; the edges of the cut should then be brought [ together by two hare-lip pins with a twisted suture, as in the case of a simple- hare-lip. When the disease occupies a considerable longitudinal extent, but does not dip down very deeply, a slice of the lip should be shaved off, including Fig. 554.—Epitliclioma of Lower l.ip : Fig. 555.—Lip after Removal ot Lines of Incision.

D jjDISEASES OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 402 natural level, thus preventing any material deformity from being left (Pin- b55). In some cases the disease occupies a square surlace, and then it is neces- sary to excise a portion of the lip: when this is done, a considerable gap is left, requiring to be filled by some plastic operation of the kind that will be considered in a subsequent chapter, which may be most conveniently done at the time when the excision is j)er- formed. When the disease occurs at the angle of the mouth, it assumes a more intractable character than when af- fecting the free part of the hp. The same operation—that of free excision —^may be apphed to it here as in the former case ; but with less prospect of success.

Heath has very successfully ex- tended this operation to cases in which the cancer of the lip had invaded the gum, and had involved the lower jaw, by removing a portion of the implicated bone, together with the disease, in the soft parts.

Tumours.—Tumours of the parotid gland itself are not so frequent as morbid giwths situated upon it or in its vicinity ; yet occasionally they <;onsist in an actual transformation of its structiu'c. 'The tumours met AAuth in this region may be simple or ma- lignant. When simple, they are often ■enqisted; they are hard, deeply attached, but movable on careful manipulation; Toimd, and of very great size, becoming ■even as large as a cocoa-nut; the skin covering them is thin but not adherent, and not imfiequently a network of veins covers the mass. These growths frequently send prolongations under the ramus of the lower jaw, and then occupy the AA'hole of ^ the space between its angle and the mastoid process ; when finnly bound doAAm, they involve the blood-vessels and nerves in this impor- tant region, coming into relation Avith the ■styloid process and its muscles, AAuth the internal as well as the external carotid, and even j)ressing upon the pharynx and projecting into the fauces, as Avas the case Avith the patient fi’om whom the annexed cut (Fig. 558) Avas taken. In such cases as these the deep relations of the tumour •are so intricate, important, and extensive, that no operation for its remoA'al can be undertaken, and the patient usually eA'entually dies in consequence of disturbance cf the cerebral circulation, or of compression of the pharynx and larynx. In consequence of the large size that these tumours may attain, they have a tendency to produce atrophy of the parotid, and often, by interfering Avith the cerebral circulation, occasion va- rious congestiAC symptoms about oost.-simiiiuTumom'iiri’iiiotiiL the brain. Besides the fibrous, various other tumours, such as aarromata, adeno- maiu, eiuhondromata, Avith which myxoma is often associated, and encysted, occur Fig. uuS.—I'Aliruus Tinnoiu' of Parotid, too deeidy seated for Reiiio\’al. n D 2404 DISEASES OF THE HEAD AND NECK. u the parotid region. These present nothing reinarkablo in their course here In some cases the parotid may undergo cancerous infiltration, the tumour then presenting the characters and running the course of the ordinary forms of malignant disease. Diaf)nosis.~lt is of great importance to effect the diagnosis between the non-mahgnant and the malignant varieties of tumours in the parotid region. In the fibrous, sarcomatous, Jibro-cellular, and enchonclromatous tumours, there is always mobility ; and, although the attachments may be deep, the skin is not involved to any extent. The outline of the mass is usually well defined, square, and somewhat lobulated. The pro- gress of the growth is very slow, often occupying many yeara before it attains any considerable bullc, as in the annexed cuts (Figs. 55!), 5G0), representing a tumour of sixteen years’ standing which I ex- cised. In the scirrhous groivth there is no mobility, but the mass is solidly fixed; its outline is ill defined, the skin soon assumes a reddish pinple colom’, is brawny, and presents the usual characters indicative of subja- cent malignant action. When these tiimom’s ai’e cnceTphdloid, they grow with considerable rapidity, feel soft and pulpy, and are rounded, and ill- defined in their outline, especially under the ear and by the ramus of the jaw. Treatment.—In the treatment of those tumours, extirpation is necessarily the only coiu’se that can be adopted; and this should certainly not bo at- tempted if the disease be malignant; for, as it woidd be impossible to remove its deeper attachments, the growth to a certainty would speedily return. Even if the disease be of a simple character, care must be taken that every lobule and prolongation be extirpated ; for, if any be left, however small, it wiU without doubt become the nucleus of a new tumour. In removing tumours in this situation, the superficial incisions should be free, and either longitudinal or crucial, so that the whole mass may be fairly exposed. It is not wise to remove integument, however redundant this may appear to be, unless it have under- gone infiltration, incoiporation with the tumour, or change of structure ; and even then as little as possible should be taken away. The fibrous or aponeurotic . investments of the timiour must be fairly opened, and the edge of the knife must then be directed against it, and the dissection carried on from below upwards, or from behind forwards, so that one division of the blood-vessels supplying it may be sufificient. After the tumour has boon well loosened by the division of investing fascim and structures (and it is sui’prising how movable it often becomes after this has been done, though it may previously appear to have incoi’porated somewhat solidly with the subjaeent tissues), it should be405 TUMOURS OF THE NECK. taken hold of by the hand or a large double hook, and drawn Avell forwards whilst the deep dissection is being canded on. In prosecuting this, the Surgeon must pai’ticultu'ly guard against wounding the tcmporo-maxillaiy artciy and the portio dura nerve, which ai-e especially exposed to injiuy.^ In some cases the di\-isiou of these, especially of the artery, cannot be avoided, as they are incorporated in the mass that is undergoing removal, ihe ha^moirhage will then of com'sc be abundant, but may usually be immediately anested by the ligatm-e of the divided artery; indeed, in most cases the bleeding is profuse, owing to the unavoidable section of nutrient vessels and of lai-ge subcutaneous veins, but may generally be readily arrested by ligature and pressure. In most instances, however, by keeping the edge of the knife carefully against the tumour, and by drawing it well forwai'd, so as to loosen it in its areolar bed ^it each stroke of the scalpel, removal of the morbid mass may be effected without the di'vision of any important vessel or nerve. It is of more consequence to •avoid a wound of the portio dura or of the chief branches of the pes anserinus, than eA’en of the temporo-maxiUary artery ; as persistent and incurable paralysis of the face would result from such an injury. Injury to this nerve is best ■avoided by dissecting out the tumour by incisions parallel to its main trunk; and chief branches, and especially by drawing the mass well forward, and directing the knife towards it. After the extirpation of some small fibrous or ■encysted tumoiu-s in the substance of the parotid, there is often a great tendency to copious secondary hremorrhage, requiring pressure, or even the ay)plication of the actual cautery, for its arrest. If the tumoiu’, though non-malignant, have been allowed to attain an enonnous size, developing at its deeper attachments as well as superficially, with lai-ge lobes lying behind and under the ramus of the jaw, in close relation with the pharynx, the internal carotid, and jugular vein, it will not be prudent to attempt its removal. Excision of the Parotid Gland itself is occasionally spoken of, but is veiy rarely if ever done. I believe that in most, if not all, the cases in which it is stated that complete removal of this gland has been accomphshed, tumours •overlying and compressing it have been mistaken for it. It is evident that a diseased parotid could not be removed without the di\’ision of the external -carotid artery and facial nerve. TUMOURS OF THE NECK. Growths, Simple and Malignant.—Besides tumours in the parotid region. Fatly, Fibrous, Glandular, and Encysted Grmvths are not imlrequently met with in the Suhnaxillai y Space, and in the Trianyles of the Nech. In these situations ey may occasionally attain a considerable size, though they seldom extend veiy deeply, being superficial to the deep fascia. Hence, when the integuments •and supeificial structm-es covering such a growth are divided, it may be insu- a ec wi sufficient lacihty, its fixity being in a great measm-c due to its beino- boimcl down by the investing fiiscia, rather than to its haHng contracted deep a esions. Occasionally, though rarely, a slo^vly growing tumour develops f cep y m e anterior triangle of the neck, lying between the sterno-mastoid ^ e hachea, and the pharynx, possibly even under the carotid sheath, with the rntciy pushed on one side, or e^■cn running over the anterior convexity of the4o6 diseases of THE HEAD AND NECK. [growth. In such cases, tlic question of removal requires to be approached vltli the utmost caution. If the tumour be movable above the vessels, it may generally be taken out; if it lie below the sheath, even though not fixed to the spine, its extirpation is not practicable. Before determining upon the removal of a tumour situated in one of the triangles of the neck, it is indeed always'S’ery necessary that a diagnosis of its nature be effected, and that some opinion be formed of the probable extent of its deep attachments. The first point to ascertain is whether it be simple or malignant. If simple, it wiU usually have been many years in growing ; it will be hard but not stony, lobnlated or somewhat square-shaped ; the patient’s general health being- good. It Avill generally be found to be movable, though not perhaps to any great extent, and will present no sign of incorporation with neighbouring stnictures ; the fibres of the platysma will not appear to spread over it, and the stemo-mastoid muscle may be traced to one side of or below it. In such circumstances, removal of the tumour may be undertaken by any Surgeon possessing a fair share of anatomical knowledge and manual skill, with every prospect of success. But if the tumour be of stony hardness, have implicated the skin, and be immovable, the whole head being moved on any attempt at drawing it aside, if it be ill-defined under the jaw and ear, or rapidly growing, soft and pulpy to the feel, deeply seated under the angle of the jaw, evidently below the platysma and deep fascia of the neck, and possibly beneath the sterno-mastoid, then no attempt at extirpation should be undertaken, as the mass could either not be removed with safety, or, if it were by any possibility extii-pated, the already existing contamination of the neighbom-ing parts would certainly lead to a speedy recurrence of the disease. In removing siihmaxillary tumours, a free superficial incision nearly parallel to the margin of the lower jaw, but below this, mil usually allow ready extirpation of the mass. In these operations the facial artery is generally sufficiently imder cover of the bone to escape injmy, but there may be, and usually is, free venous haemorrhage. Hydrocele of the Neck.—A peculiar cystic tumour, hydrocele of the neck, has been described by Maunoir and Phillips. The disease usually appears in the posterior inferior triangle, forming a rounded tumour, smooth, tense, and elastic, imilocular in some cases, multilocular in others, and filled with a yellow or chocolate-coloured sero-albnminous fluid. It may attain so large a size as to interfere with deglutition and respiration. The largest I have seen was of the size of an orange. The skin covering this tmnom- is not discoloiu-ed, in some cases of natiu-al thickness, in others thin and expanded, so as to give a bladder- like appearance to the growth. The Treatment of this tumour consists in tapping, when complete collapse of the cyst takes place ; which, however, will soon fill again. A permanent cure may be effected by injection with iodine, or by passing a seton across. True Hydatid Tumours will sometimes foini in the neck. A woman was under my care at the Hospital for a hydatid tumour of the liver which I tapped ; seven years afterwards she presented herself with a thm-waUed elastic semi-transparent tumour in the posterior inferior triangle o t e nec y about the size of an orange. This I tapped, and found it to connm ceai serous fluid, with the remains of echinococci. In another case, that ot aBRONCIIOCELE. 407 lad ao-cd about 18, otherwise healthy, I remo-s’ed a hydatid tumour as larp as a shaddock from the nape of the neck, where it was deeply seated under the trapezius, growing apparently from the substance of the complexus or splenius capitis muscles, and lying close upon the cervical spine and the occipital bone. Enlargement of the Lymphatic Glands of the neck, terminating either in chronic induration or in abscess, is of such common occuiTence as to con- stitute perhaps the most frequent form of glandular enlargement. The tumours thus formed present nothing peculiar in their progress or treatment when occun-ing in this situation ; except that when abscess forms it should be opened early by°a small incision, and in such a direction, corresponding to the natural folds of the skin, as to leave as little scarring as possible. BRONCHOCELE. The thyroid gland is subject to various simple chronic enlargements, which commonly go by the name of Bronchocele, or Goitre. These may be divided into four distinct forms, 1. Simple Hypertrophy.—The thyroid gland may be simply hypertrophied, and may then attain a very considerable size; in some cases forming an immense lobulated tumoin- on the forepart of the neck, such as is met with in- various districts of this countiy and of the continent, more especially in the valleys of the Alps, in which the disease is and has been endemic for ages.* In the majority of instances, however, in England, the tumour is of but very moderate size, commencing at first as a mere fulness and uniform or rounded enlargement of the isthmus, or of one of the lateral lobes of the thyroid gland, and gradually increasing, until perhaps, by the pressure of the growth confined between the sterno-mastoid muscle and the deep structures of the neck, the voice becomes croaking and harsh, and respiration and deglutition seriously affected. It is seldom that the bronchocele distorts the structiues of the neck to one side ; but this may happen. Thus I have seen the larynx and trachea pushed completely over to the left, forming a long convexity in that direction, whilst the carotid sheath on the right side was thrust behind the stemo- mastoid muscle. There is a remarkable connection between tumoiu’s of the thyroid gland of this kind, and a general ana3mic condition of the system. In London nothing is more common than to find a certain degree of bronchocele in pale and bloodless women and girls ; indeed, so frequent is the coincidence that it is impossible not to regard it in the light of cause and effect. Great prominence of the eyeballs is frequently associated with these conditions. In practice we constantly obsen-e this triple clinical combination, viz., anmmia, exophthalmos, and bronchocele; and the connection of these has been commented on by Graves, Basedow, Sichel, White Cooper, Aran, Begbie, and numerous other practitioners. The angemia here is the link between the bronchocele and the exophthalmos. In cases of bronchocele uncomplicated with anrnmia, the pro- trusion of the eyeballs is not met with. Thence, as anmmia is more common in women than in men, the exophthalmic bronchocele is most frequent amonust females. 2. Cystic Broncliocele is due to the development of cystic timiours in * Quis tmnWuiu Guttur mirntur in Aliiibus?rig. 501. — Cyst of ThyroUl, containing clear Serous Fluid. 408 DISEASES OF THE HEAD AND NECK. the thyi’oid gland, either associated with, or occurring independently of, general hypertrophy of it. These cysts may be single or multiple. When single or of large size, as in Fig. 5G1, they usually contain clear serous fluid. When multiple, they are filled with a fluid that presents the ordinary characters of altered blood, being dark, grumons, or like coffee-grounds, and have often cauliflower- like excrescences projecting into their interior. They appear to be of the nature of hfematomata, and occur in- dependently of amemia in persons otherwise perfectly healthy, and more commonly in young women. 3. Pulsating Bronch.ocele is occasionally met with. The pulsation, which is excentric and distensile, is syn- chronous with the heart’s action, and evidently due to the vascular character of the tumour itself. This form of bronchocele is sometimes conjoined with the cystic. AVhen it is confined to one lobe only, care must be taken not to confound the beatings with those of carotid anem’ism ; a mistake which I have known to occur. The diagnosis of the two affections has been adverted to at p. 89, Vol. II. The Causes of bronchocele have been much discussed, both professionally and popularly. The most generally received belief is, that the disease is directly occasioned by some impurity in, or peculiarity of, the water that the patients drink ; and it has been supposed that water coming through chalk or limestone is particularly apt to occasion bronchocele in this country, and that water resulting from melted snow is its occasioning cause in Svdtzerland. But these ideas are groundless. Hard water is drunk largely hi this country in districts where no'bronchocele occurs, and snow-water is never used in Switzerland ; spring-water, and that of the purest kind, being the only kind that is drunk. It would appear that air and locahty have much more to do with the occurrence of bronchocele than water. In mountainous countries the disease occins almost entirely amongst the inhabitants of valleys, where the air is moist and stagnant ; the inhabitants, especially, of valleys that run north and south, into which the sun does not penetrate readily, or for many hours in the day, which arc always in the shade of neighbouring and over- hanging mountains, are especially prone to it. This is well known to be the case in Switzerland, where the disease is endemic ; so also in large towns, it chiefly occurs amongst the poor who live in cellars and kitchens, or damp, ill-ventilated streets and com-ts. When it is met with in the richer classes, it is mainly found amongst children and young j>eople shut up in school-rooms or devoted to a sedentary and indoor life, unnatural and prejudicial. It is rarely, if ever, met with amongst those who lead open-air and acti\'e lives. Bad food and low living no doubt conduce to it. The tendency is probably hcrcditaiy in some cases; when associated with ‘idiocy, constituting that wretched condition “ cretinism,” it undoubtedly is so. Every race of men is liable to bronchocele, and it occurs in all latitudes, from the Ai’ctic region to the tropics. Thus Franklin found bronchocele amongst the inhabitants of the polar regions, and Mungo Pai'k amongst those of the interior of /Ufica. In this countiy it is most common amongst women.TREATMENT OF BRONGUOCELE. 4°9 TiiEATMETr-Thc treatment of lironchocelo must vary according to the iiiEATME. ■ tumour, and the constitutional condition associated :r;t XrsXiS .sedated .ith anemia, and of comparative^ rccL formation, it is best treated by improving the general condition of the patient This may be done in various ways : by the administration ot good food • by eban^^e of air from a low and damp to an elevated and cliy and liealtliy Situation. The change to a higher, and drier, and more lo<^ality has been much insisted on by those who have studied the disease in those valleys of Switzerland in which it is endemic ; and establishments ha^ e been erectLl several thousand feet above the level of the sea, on mountain-tops, with the view of curing patients thus aftected. Guggenbuhl has been particu- larly successful in these endeavours. In towns, the patient, if ^viug on t e basement floor, should be moved to the upper storey, if possible, and should be encouraged in habits of outdoor ratber than of sedentary or indoor occu- pations. Besides these hygienic measures, which ai'e of the first importance, the disease may be treated medicaUy by the administration of iron internally, •especially the iodide, with the external application of iodine or of iodide ■of lead ointment. Indeed, in the soft bronchocele occurring in anmmic cxophthahnic females, iron is of the utmost service, and acts almost as a specific. In bronchoceles of large size, hard, and unconnected with anmmia, the chief xeliance is to be placed on the free and continuous use of iodine internally as well as externally. The iodide of potassium is the best form in which to give the iodine internally. The quantity of this medicine should be gradually increased, until from 20 to 30 grains are given three times a day, either alone, in milk, or in combination with some preparation of iron. The iodide is pro- bably the best. But iron is very necessary in all the anmmic and exophthalmic forms of the disease. Iodide of lead and compound iodine ointment may be used with advantage. It has been recommended by Mouat that the biniodide of mercury ointment (10 grs. to the ounce) should be well rubbed in for ,several days ; and then, the tumour being covered with it, the patient should be exposed to the strong heat of a mid-day summer sun. This method of ireatment, which is said to have been extremely successful in India, has not been tried in this country to a sufficient extent to enable an opinion to be formod of its merits. In some instances jjressure has been of use, especially in conjunction with the iodine inunctions ; though it is not so easy to apply •this means, and any considerable degree of it can necessarily not be borne, on •account of the increased difficulty of respiration that is thus occasioned. In fact, the compression exercised upon the tumour by the sterno-mastoid muscle in some of these cases is occasionally so considerable that it becomes necessary •to divide its tendon subcutaneously, in order to relieve the trachea from the constriction to which it is subjected. When the tumour is cbiefly cystic, the fluid contents may be diuwn off by tapping, and an endeavour may be made to cause the cysts to close by inducing inflammation in them by the injection of tincture of iodine. When bronchocele is very large, and very chronic, its absoiption cannot, I think, be expected to take place by these or any other means ; and the question then arises as to the propriety of having recourse to operative interference. The introduction of a seton across the tumour is410 ])ISEASi:S OF THE HEAD AND NECK. occasionally attenclod by beneficial results. This operation, however, is not unaccompanied by danger ; a patient in the neighbourhood of fiondon, on whom it was being performed some years ago, lost his life by the puncture of H vein at the root of the neck, into which air was spontaneously admitted. Injection of perchloride of iron by means of the syringe figured at p. !)35, A ol. I., is likely to be of service in some cases of very vascular and pulsating bionchocele; but it is not without the special danger of forming a plug in the ciiculation, and lapidly fatal embolism has followed its use. In one instance of imlsating bronchocele in which I employed it, although much local inflam- mation and deep-seated suppuration were induced by it, the patient was in the end materially benefited. Ligature of the Thyroid Arteries has been practised by some Surgeons, with, it is stated, a certain degree of success. The difiiculties and danger of the operation, the uncertainty of its results, and the readiness with which the arterial supply would be forwvarded to the tumour from other sources, have caused it to be but little resorted to by Surgeons of the present day. In one case of pulsating bronchocele in which I had recourse to this treatment, no benefit resulted from it. Excision of the Tumour is seldom to be thought of; the disease, even though of large size, not being iTsually detrimental to life, and the danger of the operation itself extreme. The vascularity of the tumour is so great, and the arterial supply that it receives from both sets of thyi’oid arteries so- abuudaut, that any attempt at extirpation must generally be attended by such profuse hemorrhage as necessarily to endanger the patient’s life, and perhaps to prevent the completion of the operation. Cases have, it is true, occun’ed to Roux, Warren, Greene, and others, in which large bronchoceles have been successfully extirpated ; but these operations must be looked upon as altogether the exception in the treatment of the disease ; and instances are certainly not often met wdth, in which a Siugeon would think it proper to midertake so serious a procedm’e for an affection that is not necessarily mortal. Cases, how'- ever, occasionally occim in which, from pressure on the trachea, oesophagus, and jugular vein, the dyspnoea is so excessive, the dysphagia and vertigo so serious, that there is no escape from death except by the removal of the tumour. In such cases I have more than once been tempted to remove large pendulous pediuiculated bronchoceles, but close examination has satisfied me in aU such cases that the pedicle of the tumour was so vascular, containing large ai’terial and venous branches, and so intimately connected with the sheath of the carotid, stretching imder the sterno-mastoid, which was expanded over it, that no operation could be safely imdertaken. But cases have occiured in which operation has been successfully practised; and of all the methods for the removal of enlarged thyroid gland, P. H. Watson’s operation is probably the safest in execution, and most satisfactory in results. It is done as follows. A free linear incision is made in the mesial line from the upper to the lower end of the tumour, the fascia being as freely opened as the skin; but the delicate fascial investment of the thyroid gland, which is a prolongation of the sheath of the thyroidal vessels, should be left intact. The vessels on each side of the tumour, superior and inferior thyi’oidal, are then to be securely ligatured within their sheath, by passing an aneurism-needle through this, andACUTE BRONCIIOCELE. 411 tying them en masse. It is of the first importance that the vessels be tied ill and with their sheathing envelope; for, as AYatson truly observes, if this be not done, they will be found to be so ft-agile as to risk being cut through by the ligatures. After the ligature of the four sets of supplying vessels, the cellular capsule of the thyroid should be opened by being scratched through in the mesial line, and the mass removed Avith care and delicacy, all attachments being di\uded by blunt-pointed scissors. The principal danger, besides the lueuiorrhage, would probably consist in the adhesion of the tumoiu’ to the sheath of the vessels, more particularly the internal jugular vein. In one case referred to by ^Y. Greene, this vessel Avas AA'ounded. 4. Acute Bronchocele is a very different disease from the last. It is of rare occurrence, but has been met Avith both sporadically and epidemically. In this form of the affection the thyroid gland undergoes rapid enlargement,, attaining to the size of the fist or larger in the coiu’se of a feAV days or Aveeks. Both lobes and the isthmus become affected. Owing to the rapid enlargement of the thyroid body, the fascia of the neck covering it does not expand Avith sufficient rapidity; and the consequence is that the subjacent parts, as the- trachea and recmi'ent laiyngeal nerves, become compressed, so that respiration is seriously impeded, intense dyspnoea sets in, and death from asphyxia may result in the course of a fcAv Aveeks. It is difficult in these cases to hmoAV hoAV to save the patient; for tracheotomy is impracticable, OAAang to the mamier in which the tiunour dips down behind the sternum. In such cases, tapping the tmuour in different places, and the diAision of the fascia of the neck covering it, would give relief, and afford time for the action of remedies.OPUTIIALMIQ SURGERY. 412 CHAPTER LVI. —♦— OPHTHALMIC SUKGERY. [This Chapter has been wi-itten and contributed by J. F. STREATFEILD, F.R.C.S., Surgeon to the Royal London Ophthalmic Hospital, Moorfields, anl Ophthalmic Surgeon to University College Hospital.] OPEEATIONS ON THE EYE. Operations on the eye are in many ways peculiar. They specially demand an accurate knowledge of the anatomy of the parts concerned, of their relative connection and position. In eye-operations, any small error in estimating the relationships of the dehcate parts constituting the organ of vision is much more likely to be injurious than in operations on other parts of the body. Again, as the eyeball is enclosed in dense firm membranes, capable of little or no extension, inflammation is fraught with very much danger to the futme integrity of the parts. An external opening made into the globe in all probability soon heals ; but the parts within, if there be inflammation, are perhaps in so much the greater danger ; and, as the ch’cumference of the globe is limited, the inflammation is so much the more and more continually aggravated. The re-absorption of inflammatory effusion, and the retinn to the healthy state, are hindered by the unaccommodating natm-e of the sclerotic and cornea. The optic nerve will give way, after some time has elapsed, in any case of intraocular pressm’e, with, of course, serious injury to vision (see Glaucoma, p. 438). The sclerotic or cornea may allow extension j and a corneal or sclerotic staphyloma, when these structures have been weakened and dete- riorated, is formed, but very slowly, and the bulging is a permanent deformity almost always very seriously interfering with good vision. Inflammation of the eye, as of other parts—such as the testis—which are enclosed in inex- tensible fibrous coverings, is attended vith pain m proportion to the unyielding nature of the envelope ; but the functions of the eye are more readily de- stroyed, and we caimot in the same way relieve tension by strapping or by simple incision, nor can Ave so well apply cold externally. If one eye be destroyed by internal inflammation, especially of a traumatic natme, whether accidental or sm’gical, the other Avill not improbably follow it and also become blind by a pecuhar “ sympathetic inflarumation,” to Avhich the eye, among duplicate organs, is specially liable. In some cases this is almost certain ; so that the Simgeon has then fm'ther a clear duty to perlorm. Inflammatox’y effusion or suppuration within other organs, is folloAved generally by much less destructive results as regards the integrity of the AA’hole ; in them, abscess probably soon finds a harmless outlet. A few ophthalmic operations, espe- cially on the parts aromid the eye, resemble operations in similm cases inOrEriATIONS ON THE EYE. 4^3 ordinary siirgcry, and arc done according to general rules given in other chap- of the cUscascs of the eye that, oven of mm>y of the internal changes, iritic, cataractons, &c., it was no small advantage that we could their progress, and that their study was instructive inasmuch as it was the more certain. AVith the ophthalmoscope our advantages are tenfold increased, and we may see morbid processes existing even in the choroid or sclerotic coats, in the retina and optic nerve. Amaurosis is an almost obsolete term, or is, as before, at any rate restricted to those (now com- paratively few) cases of blindness in which we cannot see any morbid cliange— to nerve- or brain-diseases more or less affecting vision, and of which, even with the ophthalmoscope, we can find no evidence. But the ophthalmoscope has not added much to our powers of surgical treatment of eye-diseases. ^ VVith its aid, detached retina has been evacuated and foreign bodies or cysticercus removed from the '^utreous chamber. AA''ith it, also, we can often make a pre- vious examination to find if there be any disease to mar the good result otherwise to lie expected of operation. If we include in the term oph- thalmoscopic examination the lateral focal illumination of an eye by a convex lens and artificial light, our prognosis is of course by this often very much assisted in any proposed surgical interference, as it is in the diagnosis of many of the diseases, but only of those whose progress could be less perfectly seen and watched years ago, before the ophthalmoscope was invented and the lens used in this way,—the iriticj cataractons, and other cases of disease, not very deep-seated, above mentioned. This concentrated side light, or obhque illumi- nation, has been used in some operations within the eye, such as those for the removal of foreign bodies in the iris or anterior chamber, at the time of the operation, as well as for the diagnosis and prognosis generally of these and other cases. Performance of Operations on the Eye.—Nothing by way of gaining experience in eye-operations is of much account, except actually operating on the patients themselves. Short of this, it is most valuable to watch carefully the operations of others. In eye-surgery, practising operations on the dead subject is of little or no good to the beginner. AYhen, in general surgery, a limb is to be removed, it is amputated at a distance from the seat of the disease ; or, if an artery is to be tied, it is seciu’ed at a place remote fi’om the aneurism, so that such operations may well be practised on the dead subject. But, in eye-surgery, we can never operate at a distance from the disease ; either we are immediately concerned in the part that is diseased or we are close upon it, as in removing an opaque lens, or in performing iridectomy on an adherent iris. Squint operations (tenotomy), extirpation of the eyeball, tapping the cornea, slitting the eanaliculus, and some of the first steps of the more important eye-operations, such as the making a section of the cornea, may be practised on the dead subject; but, as to all the rest, it is mere waste of time. Almost all operations on the eye are done Avith the patient lying on a hard couch, not quite so high as an ordinary surgical operating table, Avith a hard pilloAv to raise the head of the patient a little, and comfortably. The foot of the couch is in a Avindow, facing the north if possible, and giving a goodOPHTHALMIC SURGERY. 414 light. The Sm-gcon stands behind the head of the patient, so as to use botl\ hands conveniently, and to be out of the way of the light. A towel ■spread on the pillow is thrown from behind forwards over the patient’s head, as far as his forehead, and this, at the temples, may be held, if neces- saiy, on each side, by the hands of an assistant. In some cases the wrists of the Surgeon may be brought, on each side, up against the temples, to steady the patient’s head when he is passive under chloroform. In eye-surgery, the OTms are seldom required to be moved whilst actually operating. In these minute operations often the fingers only, seldom more than the hands as well, m'e necessarily changed from their first position. Perhaps some pronation and supination of the fore-arms may be called for ; but, the patient being under the influence of chloroform, his head even then may be steadied or rotated or moved from side to side, as may be best, by resting the wrists against the temples of the patient. Even the ordinary internal squint-operation may be •done from behind the head of the patient; but, in this case, the Sm’geon is in a better position when he is sitting on the edge of the couch, on the side opposite to that of the eye about to be operated on, so that he may be as little as possible in his own light. In either position, whether from behind or •on one side facing the patient, he will, for one or the other eye, if both should require to be operated on, have to cross his hands, if not so ambidextrous that he can use the scissors with his left hand. And, in this particular •operation, that the Sm’geon is in an unfavourable position as regards light is •of little importance to him. In using the spring-wire stop specuhun to keep •open the lids, it is a point worth remembering that, chlorofoi’m not being used, less paiu will have to be borne by the patient, if, when the speculum has been allowed to open to the widest extent, it be then a very little closed and then so much fixed open. In many very trifling operations a speculum is •often used, when chloroform is quite unnecessary, and when the instrumen would not be wanted at all by a practised operator, who prefers his fingers. The same remark often applies to the use of forceps, for fixing the eye (see Tapping the Cornea, p. 431). It is weU if the fingers can be made to answer the piuqDoses of speculum and forceps ; but such pressure ou the globe of the •eye with the fingers as is required, when they are employed not only to keep the eye open, but to fix the globe, would be dangerous in any case in which any considerable opening is to be made in the coats of the eye, as in some of the cataract operations, iridectomy, &c. Operations on the eyelids and con- junctiva, the skin, and mucous membrane, are probably very much more painful than are any of the internal operations on the eye: therefore an auEesthetic may be used in such cases for the sake of the patient. In the major (internal) operations on the eye we must use the auEesthetic very much for the advantage of the operator; to whom any httle movements of the patient, during an operation, are a great inconvenience, if they be not actually dangerous to the result. • n- i In testing the amount of vision of a cataractous or otherwise blind eye (so called) we must cover the other. So also, to produce perfect seclusion of an eye, whether after operation or not, we must cover both ; because the two eyes, their irides, and the muscles of the globe, act together. And whenever a shade is ordered, it should be over both eyes.

If common bandages be employed, the two ends may be tied in a knot on the side of the head opposite to that of the eye affected • or, the two ends being split for a short distance, the two lower half ends may be tied above the occipital protuberance and the two upper ones below it The object is to employ no more length of bandage than may be required and to prevent the bandage from becoming shifted. A narrow flannel bandage, long enough to be passed many times round the head, is the best bandage when pressure on an eye is required. OFEBATIONB ON THE EYELIDS. We are here only concerned in those operations which are, at least to some extent, peculiar to the eyelids. Tumours.—Of tumours there are here, as elsewhere, many kinds. MoUuscum is very common about the skin of the eyelids. This is best treated by thrusting a shaiqi-pointed knife through the tumom', vnth the back of the knife towards the base, and cutting outwards so as to divide the upper lialf of the growth. Then with the ends of the two thumb-nails, one on each ■side, pressed together below the base of the tumour, the whole is turned out easily at once. A Sebaceous Tumour, often containing hafrs, is of frequent occurrence, especially at the upper and outer margin of the orbit. It should be dissected out altogether. It is generally very difficult or impossible to remove the whole without opening or bursting the sac. The common Tarsal Tumour, as it is called, probably has its origin in disease of the Meibomian glands. If left some months, it may become as large as half a pea; and then it suppurates, and at last bm’sts on the con- junctival side of the lid. It should be opened as soon as, when the inner sur- face of the lid is exposed, the situation of the tumour is shown by a greyish semi-transparent spot. Of course, if it have suppurated, it should be opened. By two punctures a crucial incision is made in the more transparent pai’t of the tumour, and the whole soft contents arc squeezed out with two fingers. The contents are probably firm, and cannot be evacuated, if the semi-trans- parent spot do not appear. Ptosis.—The muscle that should raise the upper lid is sometimes per- manently paralysed, and then it may be noticed that the occipito-fr’ontalis muscle of the same side, in endeavouring to raise the lid, has corrugated the skin of the brow, on the side of the paralysed muscle. Hence, in order to make more use of this new action of the occipito-frontalis, an operation is sometimes employed when all else has failed. It consists in the removal of a horizontally oval piece of skin and some subcutaneous parts of the iqrper part •of the upper lid, of a sufficient size to allow the upper lid to cover the globe, and yet, when the patient lifts his brows, that the cornea may be readily un- ■covered. A fold of the skin is seized with forceps at the place from whichOPHTHALMIC SURGERY. 4i6 it is to be taken ; and if it seem to raise the lid enough, and not too much it is cut aAvay with scissors to just that extent, and an oval wound is left. The loose and vascular skin of the lids will very soon heal without the application of sutures. Tinea Ciliaris is veiy common, but only among the very poor. Great cleanliness is required. The eyelashes should be kept cut as short as possible, for the better application of any ointment or lotion that may be prescribed, and for the more effectual removal by bathing of any accumulations of discharge from the edges of the lids. In cliroyiic cases these dried accumulations should be at once removed by bathing and viping, or with forceps, and, the lashes being cut close with scissors, the excoriated parts beneath lightly touched, at intervals of a week, with the solid nitrate of silver. The edges of the lids shoidd be kept greasy always, meanwhile, with the citrine or some other ointment. Trichiasis.—Trichiasis is an ingrowing of some of the lashes, as distin- guished from Entropion, Avhich is an intiuming of the Avhole lid. In both, the lashes are in contact with the globe of the eye ; but in entropion the lid may be temporarily rectified and held in proper position, and the lashes are not then turned in ; whereas in trichiasis the eye cannot be fi:eed from the lashes that are in contact with it without the lid being drawn aAvay, apart from the globe of the eye, as it is abnormally in Ectropion. Causes.—Of the causes of trichiasis the commonest is, perhaps, the treat- ment of “granular” lids by solid caustics applied too exclusively to the lining membrane of the lid just within the margin, whereas any local appli- cations of the kind should be, at least equally, applied far back. (In these cases entropion and trichiasis are often combined—see “ Entropion.”) Yas- cular nebula and pannus may then very probably result from the irritation ; first, of the gi'anidar conjunctiva, and, secondly, of the superinduced trichiasis. It is, perhaps, because granular conjunctiva chiefiy affects the upper lid, that trichiasis most often ocem’s in it, and so, of course, paimus appears first at the upper part of the cornea. As to the so-called Distichiasis, the disease has no real existence ; there are no cases in which two rows of lashes exist separately. Cases of trichiasis vary so much, and the modes of operating are necessarily so various, that only a few of the operations can be here detailed, and a few practical facts noted. The practice of pulling out the ingrowing eyelashes is worse than useless ; because they only grow again, the hair-bulbs being left. The case is therefore only temporarily reheved, and, in the end, vascular nebula of the cornea and consequent blindness are produced by the constant mechanical irritation of the inverted eyelashes. Lashes should only be pulled out as a temporary expedient. Patients sometimes come^ to the hospitals, almost blind, who have been taught by Surgeons to practise the pulling out of their ingrowing lashes ; they have done it for years, they have their own tweezers and looking-glass for the pui-pose, they are ^^elieved each time temporarily, but, far from being cm-ed, are always by little and little becomin„ worse. Again, they not unfrequently break off the lash, and then the broken •end causes more in-itation and pain than the whole lash had done before. An eyelash, when it is to be pulled out, should bo properly seized, near the skin, with broad and rough-ended forceps, and very steadily drawn in the directionEXCISION OF IIAIR-BULBS. 417 in which it grows. But a patient will twitch it out quickly with his tweezers at right angles to the direction of the growth of the lash, and so it is very liable to be broken off. If only one or two lashes grow in they may be pulled out, once or twice, in the hope they will not grow again, nor again bo so misdirected. But if many lashes grow in, or if a few only be always gi-OAving in, they must either be excised vdth their hair-bulbs, or an attempt must be made, by producing cicatrisation, to give a right direction to their future growth. The latter operation, being more tedious and less certain in its results, is not worth per- forming, except on young persons or those to whom personal appearance is important. When the hair and hair-bulbs are extirpated, the whole row of lashes of each lid operated on should generally be removed, though some only here and there be inverted, unless those which are turned in be all at one part of the margin of the lid. In such a case, a small round piece of the skin and all the structiu’es down to the cartilage may be excised, close to the edge of the lid, so as to expose the roots of the inverted lashes, and the lashes drawn outwards with many fine sutures, inserted wherever they seem to be most required ; after which the scar may effectually evert the ingTown lashes. If the whole row of lashes, or, perhaps, even if some all along the edge of the lid, be growing in, a similar operation to that last described, but extending the whole length of the margin of the lid, may be done. If this should fail, the lashes may afterwards be wholly extirpated. The excision of a part of the row of haii--bulbs is very often unsatisfactory, because the subsequent cicatri- sation at the extremities of the wound will often draw in and invert some of the nearest lashes of those rightly directed. Excision of Hair-bulbs is thus done. A forceps (com^ressormm\ having for its lower blade a slightly curved plate of metal, has this blade placed under the lid, between it and the globe. The other blade, the skin of the lid being drawn away from its margin, is then brought down upon the outer surface, and is screwed down, so as to steady the eyelid between the two blades and hold it just firmly enough to control the bleeding, which in any operation on the eyelids is liable to be considerable and troublesome. This upper blade, to admit of operating, unlike the lower one, is but a skeleton, leaving all the centre of the lid and its margin, on the outer side,_exposcd (Tig. 5C2). With a scalpel, two ancisions are made along the margin of the lid, one on each side of the row of eyelashes, carefully including all of them ; the knife, for both incisions, being held in the direction of and made to cut incision are curved the piece of skin, is detached altogether the growth of the lashes deeply.

The inner of the two horizontal incisions is the important one. It must be made, with a firm hand, within eyery ingrowing eyelash, but in a regular curve, so as not to make an iiTegular edge to the lid. This incision often carries away with it a longitudinal strip of the cartilage, which gives shape to the lid. It should not trench on the conjunctiva or on that aspect of the lid. Then, if any of the bulbs have been cut through and are left, they should be removed : they are easily seen in the wound as little dark points. No sutures are necessary ; the skin of the lid is abundant. Symblepbaron, etc.—When the palpebral and ocular conjuiictivae or the margins of the lids have become united, the bands may be divided, and, to hinder their reuniting, their cut surfaces maybe touched with nitrate of silver, oiled lint interposed, and a probe passed along the track of the wound occa- sionally. But, unless a probe can be, in any such case, in the first instance passed freely under the bands, so that they may be isolated, they will probably reunite to such an extent, that the operation will have been almost useless. A better plan, perhaps, than dividing the band when the union is inconsiderable, is to tie a strong bgatm'e, passed beneath such a band, around it, and then let it drop out in the com’se of time. If a probe cannot be passed under and around the adherent smTaces, or union of the edges of the lids, it may be first of all advisable to pass a few silk threads, to be seem-ed and left for some weeks, so as to make a fistulous track which shall be the limit to which it is intended to free the hd, when the parts united are afterwards cut through. Entropion.—If, in a lax state of the lids, as when a patient has lately become thin, anything should excite the action of the orbicularis muscle, those fibres next the edge of the lid not unfrequently cause it to become rolled inwards ; and then the irritation of the lashes against the ocular conjunctiva tends always to aggravate this state of the parts, set up, accidentally as it were, in the first instance, by some other irritation. This abnormal condition is most commonly seen in the lids of old people, and especially in the lower lid, which is kept out less than is the upper lid, by the convexity of the globe of the eye. For in- stance, it is a not uufrequent occurrence, and must be looked out for, and at once remedied if it occui’, after the operation for senile cataract. The lids of old people contain but bttle fat, the skin lies in many folds, and after an opera- tion, the skin of the lid is bathed in tears, and so the more easily becomes in- verted ; very often, too, water-dressings are applied. Some slight initation or pain produces—voluntarily or involuntarily—an extra contraction of the orbi- cularis, and the edge of the lid is tilted inwards. Though the irritation of the lashes is, in these cases, very much less than might be expected, and is not at aU comparable to that arising from trichiasis or entropion in younger persons, in whom the lashes are stiller or grow irregulaily, the orbicularis is stronger and the lid altogether firmer, it must be closely looked for and prevented. ' The patient should be taught, when the inversion occurs, to put his finger on the skin of the lid, and so puU it down and replace the inverted edge of the lower lid and the lashes. Water-dressings must be avoided. Very probably, however, this will not be sufficient; and then, the skin of the lower lid being drawn down and well di’ied, some collodion should be painted along the edge of the lid with a large brush, and the parts kept still until it is dried. If this be insulficient to remedy the abnormal condition, the following operation, applicable419 EGTROPIOF. jvlso to many cases otherwise originating, in which the skin of the lid is abun- dant, should bo done. An oval piece of the skin of the lid, quite close to the margin, must be excised horizontally. As much as is sufficient of the skin and subcutaneous tissues is seized with toothed forceps, raised a little, and cut away ■with scissoi-s curved on the flat. The lid is drawn open a little and steadied by the finger of an assistant, or by the little finger of the left hand of the operator, which holds also the forceps. Then all those fibres of the orbicularis nearest to the edge of the lid are snipped away with the scissors, so that the cartilage is quite exposed. No sutures are required, as a very speedy union •of the edges of the wound is not desirable, and a broader, firmer cicatrix is obtained by a slower process of healing. Enough of the skin should be removed, •and all the inner fibres of the muscle causing the inversion. jMore difficult, because more complicated cases, of older date and yet of com- mon occurrence, are those in which the lid, its cartilage, &c., is altogether thickened, generally as a residt of the application of caustics in the solid form to the palpebral conjunctiva for a longer time than was needed, probably for ^anular lids, or, as usual, too near to the margin only of the lid. The upper lid is the one most frequently affected. This is the commonest cause of trichiasis ; but it may result in entropion, or in both together. The trichiasis must be treated by excision of the hair-bulbs, or otherudse, as may be required. The entropion may be remedied in this, and in such cases of thickening of the hd, by ‘‘ grooving ” the outer surface of the length of the cartilage, near its margin, by first exposing it, and then making two longitudinal vertical incisions into the cartilage two-thirds or more through its thickness, inchned to each other, so that they meet below and form a V-shaped groove nlong the edge of the lid. Then, if there be no wrong direction in the growth ■of any of the lashes (tidchiasis), but only the regular row is canded in with the inverted lid against the eye, a few fine sutures are introduced through the skin of the edge of the wound, next the margin of the lid, and then through the edge of the groove in the cartilage, farthest from the lid’s margin. If the lashes have been removed for concomitant trichiasis, the fine suhrres are merely put through the two lips of the skin-wound, so as to approximate the sides of the groove in the cartilage, and keep out the incurved margin. In some cases of entropion, an operation, the reverse of that sometimes adopted in cases of ectropion, the V-Y-operation, may be done. A 1-shaped incision may be made through the skin and subcutaneous parts of the (lower) lid, and the point of the angle, being dissected up, is extended frown below the point from which it was taken, and then seemed with some fine sutures. Ectropion For this morbid condition, and, in a less degree, for entrojiion, 1 IS not possible to point out any single operation as a cure. Neither of them IS a disease, but the result of various diseases ; and even though two cases of ec ropioii, 01 instance, may be considered due to the same disease, they will ^ ^ ^ different methods of treatment.

The very existence also of the ectropion in time only aggi’avatcs the disease by exposure, and consequent thickening, of the conjunc- tiva. A tendency to entropion or ectropion may often be remedied by means which in a normal lid would produce the contrary results. Thus caustics too freely applied to the conjunctival surface of the margin of the lid, it has been said, have often caused entropion. So, also, if sufficiently used, the application of nitrate of silver, or some other caustic from time to time, will sometimes ciu'e a slight ectropion. It has been said that a weak orbicularis induces a passive ectropion; and also that a removal of some too powerful and active fibres of the same muscle, next the lid’s margin, wiU cure many trifling cases of entropion. Severer cases of old and confirmed ectropion will probably require to be treated by a V-shaped excision of a part of the whole thickness of the lid : the cut surfaces being afterwards brought together, and adapted with entomological pins and silk twisted around them. Ectropion generally occurs in the lower lid ; entropion (in the numerous cases in which there is thickening* and perhaps trichiasis) generally in the upper lid, being there artificially pro- duced. Ectropion from deficient power, or paralysis, of the orbicularis, by force of gravity, and entropion from excessive action of the marginal fibres of the same muscle, as explained already, both affect the lower lid as a rule. OPEBATIONS ON THE TEAR-PASSAGES. Slitting the Pnnetum and Canaliculus.—In any case in which, without any special exciting cause, the tears are found to run down the cheeks, this state of things must be remedied as soon as possible, or it aggravates itself. In the first place, in operating here, we have to ascertain, first, if the lower pimc- tum be rightly placed in contact vdth the globe of the eye ; second, if it be- patent; thirdly, if the canaliculus or nasal duct be obstructed. Seldom, if the punctum be averted from the globe, will it be enough to restore its right position. VTiilst disused, it has become permanently too narrow. If it be everted a little, it wfiU be enough that the pimctum be divided, so that the tears may reach the slit-shaped artificial opening. If it be closed, or too small, it must be slit up ; and if the canaliculus or nasal duct be obstructed, it must be thenceforth repeatedly probed. Among the preliminary “ special exciting causes ” of an overflow of tears, besides grief and casual external stimulants, such as peat-smoke, we must not omit to search for eyelashes, or other foreign bodies, in or upon the conjunc- tiva. If there be intolerance of light, there is generally an equal amount of lacrymation when the eyes are exposed to light. Both are excessive in the common conjunctivitis of weakly children. Probably, e-^-en though the cause of the weeping be but temporary—swelling of the parts near the orifice during conjunctivitis, or abscess of the margin of the lid everting the ^ punctum-—it will be best to slit the inferior canaliculus. And as to the slitting operation, it may quite safely be done in any case, even if only temporarily, required ; for, if it do no good afterwards, it does no harm, and the imperfection of the punctum seems to be of no more serious importance than is that of the pupil- lary aperture after an iridectomy that was needed and then done. As the lower lid is of the two the most subject to ectropion, so also it seems that the \SLITTING THE PUNGTUM AND CANALICULUS. 421 lower punctum is the more frequently everted, obstructed, or obliterated, biravity is perhaps concerned in both. The Surgeon’s attention is seldom caUed to the upper punctimi; if it be too small, altogether absent, or abnor- mally placed, perhaps he is not called on to discover^ the fact ; but, on exami- nation, the punctum is generally found to be in right position and patent, and yet insufficient to prevent lacrymation when the lower punctum, to which the teai-s gi-avitate, is not fit to receive them, or the canaliculus and nasal duct to convey them away. If the lower punctum be so much everted that for any length of time it is dried, it probably becomes narrowed, and would not carry away the tears, even if the ectropion were remedied and the punctum again moistened. Operation.—The patient is seated in a chair, in a good light, wfith his head thrown back, a towel over it, and resting on the chest of the operator, who is standing behind him. A finger or the thumb of the left hand is placed lightly on the lower and outer part of the skin of the lower lid, which is drawn forcibly <loi\ui and outwards, and fixed by pressure on the malar bone sufficiently to over- come the force of the orbicularis. If the punctum be not everted, so that it may be fairly seen, it is well exposed to view by slight traction ■nfith another finger on the skin of the inner part of the lower lid, drawing it downwards a little and fixing it in that position. If the skin of the lower lid be wet with tears or greasy with ointment, it should be first of aU wiped dry ; or a corner of the -towel may be required to be applied between the fingers and ■ the eyelid. The knife employed is very narrow, and about an inch in length altogether. It ends in a small probe, of about .a fine in length, Avith a slightly bulbous extremity, bent some- what towards the, cutting edge (Fig. 5G3, 1). It is held with the probe-point turned downwards and directed into the punc- I turn ; and, when the Surgeon is sure of its being in the right I .position, some little force may be employed, if necessary, for j its passage thi’ough the punctum. If the punctum be quite I •obstructed or disguised, it is well to be as sure as possible I that the knife is rightly directed ; if little pits be made in the | .soft skin or conjunctiva Avith the probe-end, it is so much the » I more difficult afterwards to make sure of the real position of ■the punctum. A minute depression, made oval by traction on ms _ „ the skill of the lid, Avill be detected in the right anatomical position or the punctum, ca'Cii if it be quite imperAfious to the ''• weber’s 'T'Urv •.* 1 . 1 , Knife for Slittini^ ^ais. me iignt position may be judged of by relaxing for an Ciimiiicnius. mstant the dragging force, and, if the lid be bathed in tears, it may be Aviped dry, and a very little quantity of the tears may be detected yiiig in the natural pit or oozing from it. The probe-point being Avithin the punctum, the knife is turned half-round, so that the cutting edge is directed upAvards and toAvaids the nose, and the probe-end, Avhich is not in a line with the rest of the instnmient, is directed in that Avhicli, anatomically, ^ kiioAvn to be tlie direction of the canaliculus. This is then aht up as far as the probe end Avill let the knife go, towards the nose, or, at least, Avell into that part of the palpcbnd conjunctiva in which the tears422 OrilTIIALMIC SURGERY. habitually lie. The nasal duct may now be probed if necessary. If a little clot of blood he between the edges of the wound, it is no disadvantage, as it will hinder their reunion. A day or two after the operation, a probe should be passed along forcibly between the edges of the Avoimd to tear through recent adhesions, if they have formed. After this, the open channel will be patent perhaps not throughout the extent of the incision, but sufficiently for from the pimctum to gain all the advantages to be desired of the operation, whether for- the admission of tears to the sac and nasal duct, when they are in a healthy state, or for the entry now and then of a probe to be passed along the latter- channel if it be obstructed. A small piece of the inner lip of the slit-up canali- culus has been sometimes removed mth advantage, when there is eversion of the edge of the lid of an amount and kind which would suggest it. It is easily done, the lid being fixed and drawn down and outwards, with forceps and scissors. The upper punctiun seems to be alone generally insufficient. I do not remember to have slit it up usefully but once, in a case {OjMJialmic Hospital Reports, vol. iii. p. 4) in which the lower orifice coidd not in any way be found in the dried mucous membrane. The upper punctum was in no way abnormal,, and, when slit, I passed a ernwed probe by it into the sac and back by the lower canaliculus so as to make it emerge at the lower punctum. Then the lower punctum could be sht as usual, and the case was cured forthwith. The upper punctum and canaliculus, even if slit, unfortunately do not make a con- venient way for the probing of the nasal duct, because of the projection of the brow ; and the upper channel alone, even if rightly placed and patent, does nob. prevent lacrymation, or at least very often fails. In acute inflammation or ahscess of the lacrymal sac, the lower canaliculus, must be slit, and the matter, if any, thereby let out on the conjunctival aspect of the lid, or evacuated with gentle pressm’e steadily made with two or three of the fingers over the sac. A new difficulty in this case presents itself in the firm swelling of the soft parts of the neighbourhood of the sac, which makes it very difficult to obtain a view of the pnnctmn so as to introduce the probe- ended^knife. This may generally, however, be done by pressing the point of a finger or the end of the handle of a scalpel into the cedematous tissues just outside the right position of the punctum, so as to evert it, although the- whole hd cannot be everted or drawn aside. An abscess of the lacrymal sac, if neglected, will open through the skin, and leave a permanent scar, but in nO’ case should it be opened externally, imless an external opening should be j)lainly inevitable, and even then the slitting the canaliculus and probing the nasal duct must be done as before. A fistula lacnjmahs is understood to mean a permanent external opening, leading dovm to the lacrymal sac, not to the- gland. It is not an uncommon result of neglect of obstruction of the nasa ' duct. Inflammation of the sac arises, and goes on to suppuration ; and, tins being neglected, the abscess opens externally through the sldn. The pam being reheved, the disease is probably still neglected, and a fistulous opening is- established. A scar cannot then be avoided ; but a fistula in this sitiiation may generally be induced to heal, if the nasal duct be diligently pi o e the natural outlet of the tears re-established. Afhilst there is isc ^ may be well, by the use of a small India-rubber bottle syringe intro uce jy423 FllOBING THE NASAL DUCT. the fistulous opening, if it have not begun to contract, or by the slit-up canali- culus, to inject tepid Avater or astringent lotions from time to time. Probing the Nasal Duct.—The normal punctum admits only so very small a probe, that, when the nasal duct is in any Ayay obstructed, it must be slit up as described. Thenceforward a sufficiently large probe can be passed, Avhen it is required, to act as a bougie to overcome such slight obstructions as not unfrequently are the cause of the endiu-ing lacrymation, or, it may be, of the subsequent serious inflammation and suppuration within the lacrymal sac ; to evacuate the muco-pm-ulent matter, and then aftemards to obviate the obstruction by sIoav degrees. BoAvman’s probes are of six sizes. Fig. 563 represents the largest. No. 6, of the actual size. It is the most useful size, and, although very often it cannot at once be passed through the nasal duct, we always aim at so doing in the fiu’ther treatment by probing of any such case. Lacrymal probes (for the nasal duct) have two slight bends at perhaps one- third and tAvo-thirds of an inch from the end, the one bend being made at a quarter turn from the direction in which the other bend is made. By haAung these different bends, the end of one of these probes vdll so much the better find its Avay and pass along the nasal duct, either unassisted, held loosely in the fingers, or being slightly rotated by the Surgeon as it is pressed downwards. The patient being seated with the back of his head against the chest of the Sm-geon, who is standing behind him, the probe is held horizontally in the right hand for the right eye, and vice versd ; Avith one finger of the other hand the skin of the lower lid is ch’aAvn doAAm and outwards, as in the operation of slitting the canalicidus. With another finger, the skin of the same lid is draAAm doAvn a httle just at the punctum, so as thus to evert the lid and shoAV the orifice by which the probe is entered, the point of it being kept doAvn a little, so as to feel the bottom of the open mucous channel as it is passed along ; and, the parts being stretched at the same time, it is hardly possible to make a false passage. The probe is known to be in the sac by the resistance that is felt, and by the absence of any elasticity ; and, when the lower hd is no longer kept on the stretch, pressing the end of the probe inwards towards the nose, if the probe be in the sac, does not pucker the skin of the parts concerned. If the probe have met with any obstruction in the canaliculus, if it have folded the lining membrane and cannot therefore pass, it should be withdraAvn a little tmd then passed onwards again, the lower lid being always drawn very much down and outwards, so as to make sure that it is in the right direction ; then, by steady pressure, with slight rotation of the probe, the obstruction may be soon overcome , if not, a smaller and a smaller probe must be used until one IS passed. Then the size of the probe is noted, and each succeeding time larpr one is attempted to be passed. It may be well, perhaps, to leave it a short time Avhen it is passed through a stricture. he probe, having been introduced into the lacrymal sac, has yet to be passe a ong the nasal duct.

The direction of the nasal dnet-domi- a in424 OPMTIIALMIG SURGERY. wai-ds, backwards, and inwards—being borne in mind, the probe is gently pressed on ; it must not be held so tightly between the lingers that it cannot follow the course of the duct, and sometimes, it has been obseiwed, a slight rotation by the Sm-geon’s fingers will facilitate matters. If it will not pass down to the floor of the nostril, perhaps an inch and a half, a little more pres- sure may be exerted and continued, and increased if the probe seem to pass at all. The probe generally passes easily enough through the lower part of its coui’se. Experience alone can determine when and how much pressm-e may be exerted without fear of making a false passage. For stricture in the bony nasal duct, it would seem to be useless to leave the probe in for a short time, as may be done for the strictures of the canaliculus above described. It should be removed when it has passed aU along the duct. It must be passed again many times at intervals of a few days, and the size, up to No. 6, increased, if at first it have not been possible to pass the largest probe. If, after the obstruction has been remedied, as very often happens, the stoppage again take place (the punctum and canaliculus ai’e now always patent), recourse must be again had to the probing. The smaller-sized probes are hable to be caught in folds of the mucous membrane and to make false passages ; and No. 6 (or 5 or 4) by a little pressm’e in the right direction, and with aU due precautions, will almost certainly pass. If the probing finally will not cure the obstruction, a style, introduced by the slit canahculus, must be worn for a time. It consists of a silver wire, of the size of the No. G probe, two inches or less in length, and abruptly tapered into half an inch of about the size of the No. 2 or 3 probe ; this end is bent down when the style has been introduced. SQUINT-OPEBATIONS. In these operations the object is, by dividing the tendon of the rectus muscle which produces the Strabismus, to cause it to become attached to the globe of the eye at a point behind its natural insertion into the sclerotic. Then the mnscle regains and retains the power of moving the eye, but in a diminished degree, so as, usually and without any special exertion, to place the eye in a position parallel to that of the other. The first point in diagnosing a fit case for tenotomy in squint cases is to ascertain that all the muscles of the eye act, and that there is no paralysis of any of them. Then, again, an operation should not be performed in any case in which the squint is not confirmed, where some- times there is no degree of squint; in such a case, spectacles should be tried. Convex glasses (for hypermetropia) are very often needed in squint cases ^ to remedy a slight degTee, or, at least after the operation, to correct the pre-exist- ing error of refraction. The hypermetropia is the cause why niost of the patients who squint have begun to do so at the age at which chili-en have learned to read and observe near objects closely. Very young children a,re therefore very rarely subjects for squint-operation. And even if the case be one of a confirmed squint, the operation (in a very young child) may be deferred, if the vision of neither eye he irnymirecl A lai-ge majority of these cases are of convergent strabismus, requiring division of the internal rectus tendon or tendons. Of 307 primary operations for squint, at the Koyai London Ophthalmic Hospital, in Moorfields, in 1871, 275 were for convergciitBQ UINT-0 PE It A TIONS. 425 and 32 for divergent strabismus. Tbe superior or inferior rectus tendons are very i-arely divided. A squint dotvmvards is hardly ever seen but in hydro- cephalus, of which it is supposed by some to be pathognomonic ; it is, in these cases, of both eyes, and only occurs at intei-vals. To ascertain the existence or the degTCc of squint, the patient is placed standing before the Sm-geon, who observes which eye seems to squint. The Surgeon, if, for instance, the patient’s right eye be tmaied inwards in looking at him, extends and closes the fingers of his right hand, bringing them with the back of the hand to the face of the patient, close up before his left eye, without touching it; then, the patient still regarding the face of the Sm’geon, the left eye being shut out, the right eye is everted from its former position and turned -out sufficiently to continue the steady gaze of the patient in the face of the Surgeon. The Sm-geon now removes his hand quickly from before the left eye, and this is observed to be turned inwards, as the right was ; j)robably it now ■quickly adjusts itself, and, as at first, the right is again inverted. Or the Surgeon, if the right eye do not now seem to be again turned in, uses his other hand, and excludes, without closing, the patient’s right eye, to see, as the patient is always looking steadily in his face, if the other will now seem to con-ect itself; and so he proceeds, successively and alternately, to confirm his diagnosis. It is vei-y improbable that, if there be some degree of convergent strabismus, even though not constant but recurrent, it will not be manifested when the patient is under the excitement of a formal examination, and is regarding a rather near object, the face of the Surgeon. If there be no squint and the previous diagnosis were in error, whichever eye is shut out in the way described, the other will not move or change its position, for it continues to look at that at which it was desired to look. If we desire to estimate exactly the degree of strabismus, the j)atient is desired to look straight before him at any object. A little mark is then made on the skin near the edge of the lower lid of the VTongly directed eye, at a point vertically corresponding mth the outer (or inner) edge of the circmnference ot the cornea. Then the other eye of the patient is closed with the hand; and the patient vnthout timiing his head, is desired still to regard the same object. e squin in^, eye is then lighted ; and another mark, again con-esponding to margin of the cornea, is made on the lower lid. Then the ^istence between the two marks is measui-ed, and the squint is said to be of so ihree r ’ ^ of convergent squint, the interval be of as much as recta 7’ ! ,'f of both the internal ostensiblv t at once, rather than that alone of the eye only squint it is Let ” fbe more common and less degrees of conrergent of the'eve habihiill * only the internal rectus tendon first onention «b n ^mde the other afterwards only if the be oSd on e? r'T- ™=“<"oient.

Operation.—The operation for squint is thus done. A wire-speculum (Fio-. hOd, a) is inserted between the lids, which are thus Avidcly opened. A small fold of the conjunctiva is then seized with toothed forceps with fine points (^.i§* o64, i), just bcloAv and a little in front of the insertion of the rectus ten- don to be divided ; Avith straight and rather blunt-pointed scissox*s (Fig. 5C4, c). this little fold is cut through horizontally ; the forceps is then inserted, closed, rather deeply in the Avound, and a fold of subconjunctival tissue, fascia, &c., is pinched up close to the sclerotic, and dmded Avith the scissors on its sclerotic side. Now, the forceps stiU holding that which was last taken up with it, the points of the scissors being stiU pressed against the sclerotic, and each time very little opened, a succession of little snips is made, the scissors being pushed backwards to some little distance beyond the insertion of the rectus tendon and below the muscle. "V^Tien none of the fascia in this tunnel-like opening re- mains imcut, when it offers no more resistance, the scissors are AvithdraAvn, and, remembering the direction of the deep little opening just made, and observing that the eye has not changed its position, or, if it have moved, allowing so much for the change of position, the strabismus-hook (Fig. 564, cl) is quickly inserted and carried directly backwards through the length of the opening in the conjunctiva and subconjunctival tissues, and then, the‘point being alwags kept close against the convex sclerotic, the handle is depressed, and the hook passed upwards under the tendon of the muscle to be divided, and brought foi-Avards up to its insertion. The points of the scissors are then carried along the sclerotic side of the hook, and opened a little, so that one blade passes Avith the hook under the tendon, and the other in front of it. This blade Avill jDass beneath the conjunctiva without penetrating it, or if it be too closely adherent, the two blades of the scissors, closed, may, before dividing the tendon, be made to open a Avay in front of the insertion of the tendon. The tendon is then cut a. h. e. rig. 5e*i.—a. AVire-Siieculum. h. Toothed Forceiis witli Fine Points, c. Straight Scissoi-s. d. Strabismus-Hook. e.

A^I throuirli ; the hook being at the same time everted a little to allow one blade- of the scissors to pass between it and the sclerotic. The scissors blades are opened as little as may be required, so as to prevent any unnecessary disturb- ance of the parts, or tearing open of the external opening. An mexperienced operator is likely to be misled by a want of knowledge of the feel of the scle- rotic Avhen it is reached as the hook is passed along beside the globe upon it or by a fear of keeping close to the globe of the eye. There is no fear, espe- cially for an anatomist, of cutting into the sclerotic. The tendon, before it is lost in the sclerotic, lies for some, or all, the distance along the surface of this membrane ; so that, to insert a hook beneath it, the end of it must be brought to bear at a point inferior to and behind the insertion ; and then, being steadily pressed against the sclerotic with some little force, it must be cairied. upwards and backwards and then a little forwards. In these operations for- the division of tendons we must also recollect how wide is the insertion, and at what distance from the margin of the cornea ; and in this they vary a httle. The opening in the conjunctiva should be made no larger than will be enough. The conjunctiva, when the tenotomy is completed by this method, prevents- the eye from being carried unrestrainedly in the opposite direction. The object is not merely to divide the tendon ; but, according to the degree of dis- tortion, the operator will separate, more or less, the tendon and muscle fi’om its sun’oundiugs. In an extreme case, any minor tendinous insertions lying beneath the chief portion of the muscle concerned must be searched for and divided; while, in trifling cases, these, or at any rate the areolar tissue in con- nection with the tendon, should be undistimbed. It is not advisable, however,, in extreme cases, that the operation should be made to resemble the old squint- operation, by dividing the conjunctiva over the insertion of the tendon. If this be done in internal strabismus, it leads to retraction of the carimcle and the phea semilunaris, and a staring look of the eye, although it be made to act in a parallel direction -with the other. To ob^date the difficulty of an exten- sive accidental rent of the conjunctiva during the operation, especially if it seem to be thin and liable to be torn open, the forceps, instead of a second time being made to grasp the parts to be divided, may at first be made to seize the subconjimctival tissues together with the conjunctiva in a fold in a radiat- ing direction from the centre of the cornea, and the conjunctival opening made far back from the margin of the cornea ; the scissors also should be less blunt- pointed than those figured, and by pressing their separated points towards the eyeball firmly before closing them, to make the division, the operation may be completed without using the forceps in the wound at aU. In extreme cases,, the corresponding tendon of the opposite eye certainly should be divided. The test of complete tenotomy in these cases is that, when the hook has becu passed so that if any fibres were uncut they would be caught in it, the con- ca\dty of the instrument can be brought up to the convex edge of the cornea under the conjunctiva, and will remain there passively, without any drao’gino’ force. ° ° As squint-operation is a painful one, at any rate as compared with most, eye operations, it is usual to give an anmsthetic ; but, during and after the in- hakation, the muscles of the eyes do not act together as they would without its having been used, and, at any rate, at such times the patient cannot be madeOPHTHALMIC SURGERY. 428 to attend well to tlie Surgeon’s wishes in directing his eyes. Children with or without chloroform or bichloride of methylene will not give us this assistance, and they therefore at least should always have the anaesthetic. The operation being over, and it being found that the tenotomy has been satisfactorily done, a piece of lint Avetted with cold Avater, and a round holloAv sponge or some wool dipped in the same, are at once tied tightly over the eye, Avith a strip of common bandage fastened behind the opposite ear in a knot. In six hours the lint, sponge, and bandage may be left off (the fear of “black eye,” or much ecchymosis, being jjast), the tAvo eyes may be un- covered and brought into use together (for distant objects as much as possible), and the eyes only bathed with lukewarm water as often as the patient may desire it. Tenotomy, as concerns the muscles of the eyes, is hardly ever done but for the cure of one or other of the kinds of squint actually existing. It is, how- CA*er, desirable to divide the external rectus tendon in some cases of muscular asthenopia (insufficiency of the internal rectus muscles) as AveU as of external strabismus ; and several of the tendons (sometimes in the same eye of the same patient) have been divided in cases of oscillating globes ; and the upper, inner, and outer tendons have been cut when an artificial pupil has been made necessarily at the upper margin of the cornea, so as to Aveaken the opponents of the inferior rectus. OPERATIONS ON THE EXTERIOR OP THE GLOBE. Pterygium.—This is not a common disease in England. The cases which we have seen have been in adult men, sailors, perhaps foreigners. The disease •consists in an hypertrophy of some portion of the ocifiar conjunctiva and .subconjunctival tissues, consequent upon some long previous chronic irritation or inflammation ; and as the vessels of this mucous membrane pass to or from the centre of the globe in front, radiating in all directions, it has a triangular shape, of Avhich one angle is at or approaches to the centre of the cornea, just as much as the vessels of a chronic ulcer of the cornea following phlyctenular ophthalmia, which folloAVS one of the exanthemata, have a Avide circumferen- tial origin, and are definitely bounded on each side, ending as it were at one point or apex—the ulcer itself. So it is in what has been called fascicular keratitis,” though the vessels are not collected in a bundle in it, but oonA^erged. Pterygium is to be got rid of, because it Avill always steadily advance up to the centre of the cornea, and so, to some extent, interfere Avith vision ; and very much too, if, as is not uncommon in these cases, more than one ptery- gium should form in the same eye, and, advancing fr’om different directions hi the circumference, meet in the centre, towards which the apex of the gTmvth is alAvays directed ; or if, as is not common, a pterygium should advance from beloAV upwards. The growth is also to be removed, because it is a conspicuous deformity, easily remediable, so that at least only an irregular Avhitish scar is left in its place. A pterygium should be removed in any stage of its gi’O" • At fii'st, it is but little redder than the suiTounding conjunctiva, and hu-cly at all raised above the conjunctiA'al surface.

No other ti-eatment is of any use. Pteryo-imn has been remo^'ed by dissecting up the growth from apex to base, transplanting the apex of the flap thus fonned into an incision made along the lower part of the ocular conjunctiva beneath the lower lid, and fixing it with sutures in this position. I do not remember that in any of the cases in which I operated in this way the disease returned; but excision of the whole growth more eflectually removes the defonnity than merely transplanting it; and total abscission is the commonly adopted practice nowadays. Nevertheless, even when carefully removed, pterygium is apt to rctuni; and hence it is important in operating to remove the whole thicliiiess of it, down to the sclerotic and cornea. Opcrcilion.—An incision is made with a scalpel through the conjuncti^ a, along the borders of the gi-owth, whilst put on the stretch by the eye being- drawm with forceps in the opposite direction, if necessary by an assistant; and then with a pair of forceps, with rather long sharp teeth, the whole width of the pterygium is taken up, between the two fines of incision in the conjunc- tiva, at about the middle of its length, and raised sidficiently to allow the scalpel to be thrust beneath it with the edge towards the cornea. The growth being weU raised from the surface of the globe, and the traction made in the direction opposite to the place of the pterygium being relaxed, the scalpel is caiTied onwards, close to the surface of the cornea, up to the centre or as far forwards as the growth extends. The w'hole is shaved off at once ; the fiap is then seized and raised, and dissected off the sm’facc of the sclerotic, and finally removed altogether as far back as it seems to extend at its base, near the junc- tion of the ocidar and palpebral conjunctive. If any small portions of the- pterygium have been left, they should be seized and shaved off the surface of the cornea or sclerotic. The growth should be removed quite up to its margins and to its apex, as far forwards on the cornea as it extends. It may everywhere be raised with forceps from the finn structures, cornea and sclerotic, beneath.. If a fine shaving of sclerotic or cornea be taken off, it is not of the serious im- portance that has been suggested ; but of course it should not be done. All soft parts, wfrere the pterygium is situated, should be dissected off the scle- rotic and cornea; and if the knife be held flat to the smfface of the globe of the eye, there is no fear that an incision will be made actually into the- globe. After the operation no special treatment is required ; but, by using warm water to bathe the eye, great cleanliness is maintained ; and, if the movements ol the eyes cause any pain in the eye operated on, they may be tied up, and so- kept at perfect rest for a while. Removal of Foreign Bodies external to tlie Eye.—A foreign body, such as a particle of dust or of coke, superficially sticking in the eye, is gene- lally to be found embedded in the cornea. The cornea is the most prominent part of the eye ; and if a foreign body should hit the sclerotic conjunctiva, it is probably somewhat obliquely, and so it may glance off at once and not remain there. It is probably soon dislodged from the sclerotic conjunctiva,, as it IS loose and easily moved, and is washed away in the tears. It is often very difficult to see the -\’ery small foreign bodies which lodge in or upon the-OPHTHALMIC SURGERY. 430 •cornea, especially if tlic iris be dark-coloured, as they are also generally. In order to detect the presence of a foreign body, the Surgeon must open ■U’idely the patient’s eye in a good light, and bid him look in various directions cr on all sides, successi’^'ely ; when, if the iris be light-colomcd, the foreign body is probably soon detected as a dark speck, and may be removed forth- Avith. If the foreign body be hght-coloured or transparent, its situation may be detected on the eye itself by A'iewing the convex mucous surface, in all its parts successiAcly, Avith the light of the Avindow reflected from it, and then, at this point in particular, the light is irregularly reflected as it is in case of a simple abrasion, or loss of substance, when there is no foreign body. If it be not thus detected, the lower lid must be pulled doAvn with a finger placed on the skin of the lid, and the patient desired to look very much upwards, so as to expose completely the palpebral and ocular conjunctival surface of the lower part of the eye. It is, however, more probable that, if the foreign body be ruider either eyelid, it is the upper one. In this case the Sm-geon, standing before the patient, places the end of his forefinger sideAvays on the lid near its outer edge, without inAmlving any folds of loose skin ; and pressing a little on the eye, makes the hd slide downwards, as far as possible, over the lower nfraid of them as of any instrument. The little operation cannot, howeA^er, be done the first time it is attempted. The patient may move back his head just as the tinn is to be completed (therefore the head of the patient must be steadied by being placed against the wall, or the back of his chair, oi by the other hand behind it); or the lid is not seemed between the finger and thiunb before the eversion is attempted ; or the lashes only and not the lid are held ; or one fears to press the forefinger sufficiently into the eye to effect the ever- sion. It is very much more difficult if the patient be fat, the eye deeply set, and the orbicularis strong, or the lid thickened and contracted—inclined to be iiivm'tp.d—bv old results of oiDhthahnia. The upper lid being everted, it is Fij;. 665.— Eversion of Uiiper Lid for Deteidioii of Foreign Bodies. lid. The lid (not the lashes) is then seized firmly by the end of the thumb applied sideways ; and the end of the forefinger is tm-ned downAvards, while the lid is held firmly by the thumb and finger. The hd is thus everted (Fig. 5G5). This is a better plan than using a probe, or a pen laid horizon- tally on the lid, and then pulhng the lid by the lashes over the barrier so as to evert it. The fingers are ahvays avail- able, and the patient is not so muchREMOVAL OF FOREIGN BODIES. 431 tlicro. If it be not now found we may again examine the cornea, for it is here that nearly all foreign bodies in the eye are found ; and the oblique illumina- tion with the ophthalmoscope, using a second convex lens as a mag-nifier, may be serviceable in this examination. Xot unfrequently a larger foreign body, sueh as a small button, or a husk of corn, purposely or accidentally introduced under the upper lid, has passed beyond the upper edge of the cartilage, and so is retained for months or years, until the persistent slight irritation leads to its detection and remo^'al. Therefore, in doubtful cases, as above recom- mended, the spooii-end of a probe should bo used. To avoid eiTor in diagnosis, it is always well to inquire if the patient remember the time at which the foreign body entered the eye, when he has the sensation of an existing body, for there arc many irregularities of the ■surface of the palpebral conjunctiva, which, in its movements, give the sensa- tion as of a foreign body when there is none. Conjunctivitis especially is a •cause ; and if there be no such cause, and the patient recollect no particular time at which he fii’st felt the foreign body, and “ something got into his eye,” Ave must look for some httle tumom-, or a somewhat inverted eyelash ■or other persistent cause. A patient may have the sensation as of a foreign body in the eye when it is there no longer, but has left, perhaps, a slight ■abrasion. A foreign body in the cornea is best removed with the end of a little instru- ment which is like a piece of wire flattened at the end, and with a round edge, hut little sharpened, like a “spud.” A piece of wire, beaten out at the end, is the instrument made for themselves, and used by some one of their number, by the workmen in some of the large factories. With this, the lids and the eye itself being held open and fixed with the fingers, the foreign body is tmned out of the hollow in which it is embedded. Some- times, if it be very deep in the cornea, a sharp-pointed or cutting instrument must be used. There is a class of cases by no means common, which may be considered together with foreign bodies in or upon the cornea, for the offending sub- stance IS quite superficial to the cornea and keeps up irritation. It appears as a perfectly opaque, dense, whitish opaeity on the front of the cornea, unlike leucoma in its perfecthj definite outhne, and in being very superficial and dead- ivtule m appearance. There is also some injection of the eye, which there is not generaUy ni cases of circumscribed leucoma—the dense corneal opacity ong a tei t e inflammation before it. The foreign substance is deposited n some Pol low of the cornea, an excoriation, abrasion, or ulcer, probably after some lotion of acetate of lead, which is too often applied by patients for holll^’rfindiscriminately.

But it432 OPHTHALMIC SURGERY. ■will not probably be follo'wed by a Icucoma ; the cornea will become and remain tolerably or quite clear when this superficial opacity is removed from its surface. A little olive oil is di’opped upon the cornea, and the eye bandaged with belladonna lotion or fomentation, until the wound has healed and the epithelium is restored. Tapping the Cornea.—This little operation often does much good, in cases generally only medically treated, locally and generally. AVhen there is pus between the layers of the cornea (onyx) or in the anterior chamber (Jiypopyon), or in painful ulcer of the cornea without suppuration, it often acts like a chai’m ; some of the aqueous hmnoirr and pus is evacuated, the pain dis- appears, and the chronic ulceration of the cornea begins to heal kindly. The operation should be adopted in a greater number of cases ; but it must be done properly without wounding the lens or iris, or doing anything but just to make a small clean punctm-e obliquely into the aqueous chamber, and so letting the fluid contents leak away quietly, and not very rapidly. In onyx and hypopyon, the tapping, to be efficacious, may require to be repeated at short intervals ; and if it fail, as it will probably, if it do not from the first seem to have been beneficial, iridectomy must be done, and 'wiU probably succeed. Iridectomy is often performed at once in these diseases; but, in most of the less serious cases, with no increase of tension of the eye, the minor operation of tapping is all-sufficient. Operation.—A spring (stop) speculum to keep open the fids, and a fine- ended and two-toothed forceps to steady the eye and hold it down, may be and are generally employed (Fig.- 564, a and V). But, uifiess pressure on the globe would endanger the good result, they are unnecessary, and are liable to alarm the patient. In performing the operation, the upper hd should be raised, and the end of the forefinger of the left hand laid horizontally and rather flat upon the edge of the lid and on the globe above the cornea, taking* care here, as in other eye-operations, not to touch the eye with the finger-nail. The lowdfr lid is similarly depressed and held down Avith the middle finger of the same hand, on the eyeball below the cornea. The two fingers are separated directed obliquely do^vnwards and across the anterior chamber, as if about to make a counter-puncture at one-third of the circumfeicnce. i c eye tends to roll upwards, the needle, when directed downwards, cannot woimd Fig. 506.—Tapring the Cornea. as widely as necessary, and such pressure is exerted upon the globe backwards as 'will allow no oppor- tunity of closing the lids and of the orbiculai’is regaining its power of action (Fig. 566). The front of the globe is now very promi- nent, and the eye is at least as much under control as if it were held with forceps. With an ordi- nary broad needle, flat forwards, held in the right hand, the punc- ture is made in the cornea near the margin, the point being soonARTIFICIAL PUPIL. 433 the lens. In this way the blade never passes the pupillary margin ; its point is always in front of the iris, never of the lens (Ffg. 5G6). As soon as the broadest part of the blade has entered the cornea, it is partly withdra-wn, and, cuttino- do^vnwards a little meanwhile, the point of the needle is again directed to the' centre of the anterior chamber. As the opening is now a little larger than the blade, this can be rotated a little ; and, when it is held in this way, the aqueous humour or the contents of the aqueous chamber will flow out beside it, more or less slowly, according to the amount of the rotation. As it is almost all evacuated, the pressure of the two fingers, keeping open and steadying the eye, must be a little remitted ; probably no great effort at move- ment will be made by the patient at this time, but, to prevent possibility of accidents, the broad needle, stiU held flat forwards, should now be brought altogether somewhat forwards, and may thus be used in some degree as a point (Vappui. The operation done, the needle is quickly withdrawn, and, the fingei-s being removed, the eye closes. In this brief and simple operation, every precaution must be taken against wounding the lens and making a trau- matic cataract. This accident may occur whether the eye be steadied by the finger or by speculum and forceps, either when the needle is introduced, or when the last of the aqueous humom- is let out. The operation is attended with little or no pain, even if anesthesia be not employed ; and, if the fingers and one instrument only (the broad needle) be used, the soft parts of the fingers give no pain, and the patient is but httle alai’med. OPEKATIONS ON THE IRIS. Artificial Pupil.—In this operation a piece of the iris is either removed altogether, excised (iridectomy) ; or, by simple incision, an opening is made in the iris-tissue. The term artificial pupil is also applied to any oj)eration by which the natiual pupil is displaced and altered in shape and position, as well as to those by which an addition is made to the natural pupil, or those by which an altogether new opening is made in the iris itself. There are many different directions in which an artificial pupil may be made: (1) central and downwards, or (2) down and inwards, or (3) down and out- wards, or (4) inwards, or (5) outwards. The upper lid so much covers the upper part of the cornea and iris, that it is a forlorn hope only when the operation is done any way upwards, as a direct means of improving vision (see “ Indectomy for Glaucoma,” p. 436). Artificial pupil, is called for in many very different cases. In Partial Opacity of the Cornea, or without iris-adhesions, it is leqmred to make a pupil opposite clear cornea.

Oplifchalmic Hospital in Moorflolds, without reckoning any of the very nume- rous preliminary iridectomies in cataract extraction and other operations. If an operation for artificial pupil be thought of in a case in which the natural pupil is quite obliterated, or where, in any case, even u'ith atropine, an ophthalmoscopic examination of the fundus cannot be had, the Surgeon must first carefully ascertain that the eye retains perception of light. But, in order that the operation may be likely to succeed in restoring useful vision in such cases, the patient should not only have a perception of light, but should be able, when the other eye is closely covered with the palm of the hand, to readily perceive the shadow of the hand of the Surgeon when it is passed quickly before the light, between it and the eye of the patient, even at a distance of two or three feet. If there be a less degree of vision remaining, if the tension of the eyeball be plus or minus, indications of intraocular pressure, or atrophy, there must have been some deep-seated disease, besides the iritic inflammation, the immediate cause of the obstructed pupil. After estimating the degree to which vision is impaired in the case of proposed operation for artificial pupil, the Surgeon must observe accurately what evidence of past disease he can see with his own eyes, and compare all this with the history of the case. If cor- neal opacity be the reason why an artificial pupil should be made, the opera- tion must be deferred until, after some months at least, no improvement by progressive clearing has taken place, according to the history of the case, or by the Siu’geon’s observation, no redness of the sclerotic has appeai’ed around the cornea, and no former operation of the same kind has been attempted. A lad was admitted at University College Hospital for the operation of artificial pupil. He had had keratitis of both eyes some years before, and shght attacks more recently. He had been treated at intervals as an out-patient for a long time, with cod-liver oil and syrup of iodide of iron, &c. He was antemic, and, apparently, lived poorly. When taken into the Hospital, he had full diet, and he sat, almost blind, by the fire with the other patients. Very soon he could see better, and in a short time the clear marginal part of the cornea was wider. When the operation was performed, a few weeks after his admission, it was remarkable how his corneas were cleared, after they had been at a stand-still for months, if not for a year previously, according to the patient’s own account, and the latter part of the time during which he had been mider our own observation.* Of com’se, if there be ever any appearance of present, or any history of recent inflammation, any faint diffused nebula of the cornea and slight redness around it, it must be understood that it is not of that external nature with superficial vessels, due to granular lids, an inverted eyelash, or other mechanical means, but an affection of the cornea itself. One can only wait for the cornea to clear as much as it will, always from the margin, of course. The general health of the patient must be attended to, and belladonna locally may be of some use, meanwhile, as a sedative and mychlatic. In any case of opacity of the cornea extending nearly to the margin, and allowing at no part any wider clear space for artificial pupil, the incision of the cornea must be made in the sclerotico-corneal junction and vciy * 111 cases of old hopeless leueoinata, at a operation he done, the disflgiu'emeiit may colour than the iris. suhsoqueiit time to the ojieration for artificial pni'il, if iiiiy such he entirely remedied hy tattooing them of a somewhat diirkcr435 IRIDDESIS. little obliquely, so that the iris may be dra-wn out quite up to its outer circumference. Artificial pupil, if one eye only be diseased, is urgently required if there be total posterior synechia or numerous adhesions, and should be done, although the performance of the operation is not urgent, if the patient incline to it, in nny of the other cases, even if the unaffected eye be perfeetly sound. Incision.—This is an operation not much in use. It is advisable perhaps ■only Avhen the lens is no longer present, or, at least, is useless and of no nceount by results of operation or injury, and the iris has prolapsed through the corneal wound ; or when the puinl has been -obliterated in consequence of iritis, the cornea remaining clear, and, there being no communication between the anterior and posterior aqueous chambers, the iris-fibres bulge forwards all round wherever they are not too tightly stretched. When they thus bulge, though a transparent lens may be supposed to exist behind the iris, it may perhaps be safe to incise the tense iris-fibres somewhat obliquely : but, in such ■a case, probably an iridectomy Avould be a better operation. It is probable, indeed, that mere incision for the formation of an artificial pupil, should be confined to those cataract-cases in which the extraction-operation has been followed by inflammation and closed pupil, with stretching of the iris-fibres. If, in such a case, the Surgeon anticipate inflammation to follow the secondary operation, one simple cut with a broad needle may be rapidly made across the ms flbres. In such cases, too, the iris may be fearlessly incised ; there is no transparent lens or no lens to be wounded. The vitreous humoiu’ probably protrudes through the opening in the iris ; and, if no fresh inflammation be set up, a good pupil may be made, and may remain (Fig. 567).

Iridclcsis makes a I’cgnlav oiifclinocl pupil, of moderate size, largest towards the centre of the cornea (Fig. 509). In these diagrams the cornea is never represented : a central leucoma is supposed to exist in the present instance. The dotted circle shows the place of the pupil before displacement. The-, operation does not cause bleeding into the anterior chamber, and its subsequent complications. The pupil may be larger or smaller, but not veiy large ; and as it is made, so it remains definitely. Iriddesis has been much in vogue for cata- ract of that “ congenital ” form (lamellar and nuclear) in which some layers, or some parts of them, are definitely opaque, if centrally, vath a clear marginal part of the lens. This is a stationary form of cataract, and if atropine show a sufficient margin of clear lens, generally behind the iris, we may make there- an artificial pupil by displacement and ligature, and let the patient have the use of the natural lens, rather than substitute a glass. The Operation is done thus. The eye being exposed, and held with speculum and forceps, a broad needle is passed through the cornea at that part of the margin towards which it is desired to place the pupil. An assistant then places a little- loop of very fine black silk over the opening on the wet surface of the conjunc- tiva, and leaves it there. To draw out as much of the iris as is required, either an ordinary silver iris-hook is used, or, if it be desired not to include the whole breadth of the iris to be prolapsed, and the pupillary margin is to be left free, a cannula-forceps is used to seize the iris midway between its greater and lesser circumferences. The part of the iris which is to be secimed being now dravTi out by the corneal aperture, the assistant, holding in each hand a forceps with broad ends, like those used for puffing out eyelashes, seizes the ends of the ligature, and, when desired by the Surgeon, tightens the loop and leaves it. This he does whilst depressing a little the ends of the two forceps, so as to tie the knot-quite close to the cornea ; and he is careful not to pull the ligature -more one way than the other, lest the iris be dragged on one side, oi, being very delicate, and offering no perceptible resistance, it be very easily cut through. The ends of the loop are then cut ofl^ close to the cornea, the eye is closed, and both eyes are bandaged. If the knot have been sufficiently tight- ened, the portion of iris so strangulated and the little loop of silk vnU ffiop off in a day or two ; and the iris, meamvhile, has formed an adhesion within in front (anterior synechia). But by this method of proceeding the tiUimate results are often very unsatis- factory : the iris is confined, and a low chronic recurrent iritis, etc., may be set up which leads to far worse results than the state of things which the operation was intended to remedy. These artificial anterior sjmechise seem to be as per- nicious as are the common iritic posterior synechim. We have seen many instances iUustrative of this disagreeable truth. An excision of ins is a far safer though less attractive operation. If iriddesis be ever to be done, we prefer the proceeding with cannula-forceps, seizing the iris midway, and no the pupillary edge, as in this way much less confinement is caused ; and w icn hut a slifiit displacement of the pupil will effect the purposes of good vision, iriddesis may yet be permissible. , . n i Excision : Iridectomy.—This operation is especially ad^usable when a siderable opacity of the cornea leaves only a very when iritis has caused occlusion of the pupil (Fig. 568), total posterioi synechia437 IRIDEGTOMY FOR GLAUCOMA. or very considerable adhesions, whicli cannot be detached by the use of bella- donna, or by operation : when perforating ulcer or other cause has ended in complete or almost complete adhesion of the pupillary iris to the cornea. But in all the cases requiring artificial pupil operation, an excision of iris is in a very lai'ge majority the best. Operation.—An anmsthetic is first given, and the eye is kept open and steadied in the usual manner with speculum and forceps. An opening into the anterior chamber, of at least one-eighth of the circumference, is made in the corneal margin with an extraction (Sichel’s) knife. If now it should be necessary that the eye be held in order that the corneal wound may be exposed, the forceps to hold the eye is handed to an assistant; and the iris-forceps, closed and held in the left hand, is introduced into the anterior chamber. A sufficient quantity of the iris is seized and drawn out ; and, with the iris-scissors laid fiat on the surfiicc, it is snipped off close to the cornea. The operation, with extra pre- cautions at the time and subsequently, is described below (see “ Iridectomy for Glaucoma ”). An artificial pupil should not be very small, as it wiU more probably become closed by subsequent inflammation, or, if not closed, contracted tdl it is much too small for useful vision. The iris must be seized -with forceps : a hook may tear through rotten or firmly adherent iris, or vffil draw out too little. No blood should be allowed to accumulate iu the anterior chamber, if it can be prevented. No clot should certainly be left between the edges of the wound in the cornea. And, if the iris, close to the part where it has been cut off still hang in either angle of the corneal wound, it must be retimned with the little spatula made for this purpose, or with the end of the cm-ette. Besides the operation for glaucoma, for artificial pupil, and for recurrent iritis wth adhesions, in which iridectomy is called for, there are a great many other ■cases in which nidectomy is now usefully employed. In some of them, as, for instance, in acute ulceration of the cornea and hypopyon, simple paracentesis cornem may be sufficient; so that, if we doubt the necessity for iridectomising, we can give it a trial meanwhile. If, after an iridectomy for glaucoma or lecuirent iritis, the disease retiu’u, the operation may be repeated : the portion of iris removed being opposite to that excised on the former occasion. An mdectomy in the first instance for total posterior synechia or for hypopyon, should be a large one, and upwards as in glaucoma cases. Iridectomy for Glaucoma.—Although the common operation for ai-tificial pupil, to which I have just referred, or for recurrent iritis, may be quite correctly caUed iridectomy, as it used to bo before the cure of glaucoma was iuvented by Von Grafe, yet the operation and all about it is widely different from that lor glaucoma, as may be seen briefly in the following comparison of the two IrUIcctomy to cure Glmicoma.

The operation is best done dvu'ing inflam- mation. (When there is pain, &c.—inthe acute cases.) Operation cannot be deferred. The excision is best made upwards, where it is covered by the xipper lid. The piece of ii’is should be taken specially from the greater circumference. The piece of iris excised should be large. The good result of the operation is im- mediate. The pupil is never afterwards blocked up. ing examination with the ophthalmoscope, quite irrespective of any tui'bidity of the humours, or liaziness of the other media. The operation is only allowable when no inflammation exists. Operation may be put off without harm. The excision should be made any way but upwards: where most convenient, at any exposed part. The piece of ii-is should be probably taken from the pupillary margin. It should be small, or smaller, at any rate, than that in ii'idectomy for glaucoma. The good result appears after a while. Not unfi-equently resultless by secondary iritis and occlusion of the pupil. We see, therefore, in the fii’st place, that in glancoma the portion of iris to be removed must he taken from its whole width, quite np to its greater circum- ference (Fig. 570), so that the preliminary opening made into the anterior- chamber must be in the sclero-corneal junction, or in the margin of the sclerotic itself; not in the cornea, as it should be generally in the formation of ai’tificial pupil by excision. For glaucoma, the piece of iris excised must be larger than is usual for an artificial pupil; and, that the gap made when the iris is removed may be hidden, it should be beneath the upper lid, just where an operation for artificial pupil would be out of the question. The chief steps of the operation are the same as those described ah’eady for operation of artificial pupil. But, chlorofonn having been given, if desired, the -wire-speculum and forceps being used, to keep open the lids and to steady the eye, an opening extending to one-fourth of the circumference must be made in the sclerotico- corneal junction, or even in the margin of the sclerotic, at the upper part. About one-fifth of the whole iris is removed in the operation. For this pm- pose, a lance-shaped knife is generally thrust into and across the anterior- chamber, and the incision is extended, if necessary, as the knife is being- removed ; but an ordinary (Sichel’s) extraction-knife is much preferable. It cuts better, requiring less thrusting force, and -with it the wound in the cornea may be made less obliquely through the coats of the eye, nearer, that is to say, to- the greater circumference of the iris, Avhich we want to reach ; and the point of the cutting instrument always between the cornea and iris may be kept, quite away from the front surface of the lens, instead of being, as when the lance-knife is used, necessarily carried straight across it. In glaucoma, the anterior chamber is very shallow. The point of the knife, which may be held in the right hand for either eye if the operator be not ambidextrous, is intro- duced in the sclero-corneal junction, at the right extremity of the incision to be made, and carried a little way towards the centre of the anterior chamber ; and, when it has well entered this chamber, the cutting edge is directed up- wards and forwards, and being thrust onwards steadily, with a firrn hand, so as not too quickly to evacuate the aqueous humoiu’, is made to cut, aided perhaps by slight sa-wing movements up and down, rather vertically (not by inaking a counter puncture, as some recommend) as far along the extreme margin of the cornea or sclerotic as the length of the incision is to be made, at least one-DIAGNOSIS OF GLAUCOMA. 439 sixth of the circumference. The knife, as it is withdra\vn, is then brought once more with its point directed towards the centre of the chamber, so as to make a similar scpiare extremity of the incision, to the end at which it was begun.* Then, as in the excision-operation for artificial pupil, the fine curved iris- forceps is introduced, and the toothed points opened in the anterior chamber (miless the iris have prolapsed, with the flow of aqueous humour, when the corneal wound was completed) widely enough to seize a rather large portion of the iris. This is then drawn fully out, and is first cut through with the iris- scissoi-s vertically on the right side ; then, the blades of the scissors being held flat on the surface of the globe, it is divided along its ciliary attachment, close to the opening into the anterior chamber, and, lastly, it is separated altogether by another vertical cut. The operation is then complete. If much bleeding into the anterior chamber occur, the blood must be, if possible, coaxed out in one way or another, before it has formed a clot. The point of the curette between the lips of the wound, or on its posterior lip, may do this ; or the blood may be pressed out -with the convex back siuface of the same instrument, by passing it, wet with tears so as not to abrade the epithelium, from below upwards over the front sm-face of the cornea ; or, by gently pressing back the wire-speculum upon the eye, it may be squeezed out. If there be bleeding, however, some blood will probably be left, and cannot be removed. The eye is tied up with some lint, wet or diy, over it, and a bandage is applied over both eyes. Diagnosis of Glaucoma.—In the diagnosis of a case of glaucoma, much stress must not be laid on the meaning of the word—the sea-green colom’ in question is often not at all seen in the reflected light fr-om behind the pupil. The chief diagnostic signs are these 1. Tension in excess—varying fr-om the least degree T. 1, to a stony hardness, T. 3. It is appreciated by the two fore- fingers, used much as in trying elsewhere to discover the existence of deep- seated pus, the patient looking down and gently closing the lids ; or the amount of tension may be appreciated by the eye, as well as by the touch, by placing the point of the forefinger on the ciliary margin of the patient’s lower lid, and indenting the globe as he looks up. 2. Pain in and around the eye, which is often intolerable, generally intermittent. Earely does a case of painless (non- inflai^atoiy) glaucoma occm-. 3. Halos are seen around the Light. 4. Pres- hjo^c symptoms are present. 5. There is narroiuing of the field of vision. C. There are olscurations. 7. The appearance of the eye externally : a. Large tortuous \’essels are seen to course over the sclerotic, and dip into it in the ciliary region ; 1. The anterior chamber is shaUow, the lens, and the iris mth It, being by pressure from behind, thrust forwards in approximation to the back surface of the cornea ; c. The pupil is large and inactive ; d. The cornea Has more or less lost sensibility, and reflects light from its sm-face imperfectly ; e. ine lens is perhaps cloudy (not cataractous, not opaque after iridectomy)’ 8 Ophlhalmoscoptc appearances. When the fundus can be seen (and it very 0 en can le, though the aqueous and vitreous humours be somewhat obscured even when the cornea looks steamy and the lens cloudy), the excavation, more keratome or the eouTiter-pmSrS^ f f'oso made with the thrust of a been adopted on principle by some of my coUeapics^ ^ ‘ Cataract, page 440) has, I am glad to lind.440 OPHTHALMIC SURGERY. or less, of tlic entire surface of the optic nerve-cntraiice, and tortuosity and congestion and pulsation of the retinal Tcins (and arteries), which are displaced and compressed against the white margin of tlie “ cup,” and some little ecchy- moses therefrom, perhaps, are the marked features. These signs arc all due to increased intraocular pressure, as is shown directly by the excessive tension (the first diagnostic sign given), in consequence of the contents of the globe being more than is normal. Glaucomatous is a term applied to symptoms of increased intraocular pres- sure (tension) in other diseased states of the eye, in which iridectomy is per- formed with much benefit to the patient: hardness of the glohe being in any such cases whatever, the indication for the operation. As it is specially im- portant to recognise glaucoma in its first stages, we must not look for the corneal and lenticular changes, or much “ cupping ” of the optic nerve in all cases of the disease, or the operation will have been deferred long after it should have been done. Glaucoma is a disease of elderly or of old people of impaired health. The earhest symptoms are, to the patient, perhaps, intermittent obscm’ations, halos, and more or less wandering pain ; and, to the Surgeon, in- creased tension, some congestion, dilated pupil, shallow anterior chamber, and ophthalmoscopically, some excavation of the optic nerve-entrance and venous pulsation. In the case of an eye blind by old neglected glaucoma, nidectomy will perhaps reheve pain ; but probably it should be extirpated. The benefits of iridectomy, properly performed, and sufficiently early in glaucoma, are patent ; and it must be done, when the opportunity offers, even when the time most favom’able for its performance is gone by, and even in the chronic cases, in which the results are always least advantageous. Without operation, glaucoma certainly ends in total blindness. It is probably, in the fii’st place, choroiditis, and effusion in the vitreous space. It goes on by pro- ducing such structiu’al changes in all the tissues of the globe, that total dis- organisation is the result. Prolapse of the Iris.—This means a bulging of the iris through an ulcer which has perforated the coats of the eye, or through a wound in these coats, either made accidentally, or in the com’se of a surgical operation. It is often caused by the fii’st gush of aqueous humom- as it escapes when the perforation is complete, and remains there passively imtil it is either pushed back into its place "with a spatula or curette, or made to return by causing contraction or dilatation of the pupil by instillation of a solution of (atropine or) Calabar bean, one or the other, as the case may seem to need. It is evident that, if the external opening should be in or very near the centre of the cornea, a prolapse of the iris cannot occur ; it cannot be very far from the corneal margin, the position in which most of our internal surgical operations are commenced. If a pro- lapse is to be retm’ned, it must he done very soon after it has occurred, oi the iris will probably have become adherent to the margin of the external opening, forming what is called synechia anterior, or, compressed between the edges ot the woirnd, the iris vdU have at least become strangrrlated. Iir nidectomy operatiorrs, however, it is an advantage that a prolapse of the iris followir^ t e curneirt of the aqueous humour should take place ; for their we nee rro introduce to the anterior chamber the forceps by which it is to be draiur ou . ^ In other cases, prolapse of the iris is caused by pressure of the aqueous orSYNECIIUi: CORE LYSIS. 441 vitreous humour behind it, and is not brought about in any sudden or impulsive manner ; it is then discovered as a little bag of a dai’k colour'- whatever may be the natural colour of the iris. If; being recent, we hope to retm-ii the pro- lapsed iris intact, Calabm- bean and a strong light may be tried ; and the return may be aided, if the prolapsed iris be distended by the aqueous humour, by gently pressing it back with the end of a spatida, by puncturing the most pro- minent part with a needle and relieving the distension, or by closing the lids and making some pressure upon them and rubbing them gently with the finger. The iris bulging may be ah-eady adherent to the margin of the external opening and cannot be returned ; yet it may increase by the opening becoming larger or by an increase of pressure from behind, and this we must guard against by ai'tificially contracting or dilating the pupil, as the case may be, by con- tinued pressure of a pad of wool and a bandage, or, if the prominence be much, by punctiu'ing it, or, supposing it to have become firmly adherent, by snipping it off with a pair of small scissors. In the old operation of extraction of cataract by a semicircular fl^ap, the iris, which is to be left intact, often prolapses, and this is one of the chief difficulties of this operation. It occurs either at the time of the operation, the vitreous humoiu' after the lens is gone, causing it to bulge forwards between the lips of the wound; or the iris is found, after some days, to be involved in the weak and slowly progvessing cicatrisation of the same. In the former case it should be smoothly and gently pressed back into its place with the flat side of the spatula held horizontally, and then, all pressure being taken off the globe, the lids are to be closed and so the lips of the wound kept together. When the piolapse is discovered some days after the operation has been done, of course it •cannot be returned ; pressure may then be employed, or, if the prolapse be considerable, it may be punctiued or incised, or, better still, the prominence, if sufficient, be cut off. Synechi® : Coveljsis.—Anterior Synechia, or adhesion of the iris to the cornea, only takes place when the two have been brought together for a time by evacuation of the aqueous humour, generally by perforating ulcers of the cornea (see Prolapse, p. 440, and Iriddesis, p. 435.) Posterior Synechia, or adlmsion of the iris to the lens, which is veiy much more common, results from mtis; and these adhesions, once formed, are seldom detached, as in any case way possible : for, if not, an iritis can aidly be said to be cured Posterior synechim may be numerous, or the whole 0 e pupi^ ary maigiu may be bound down to the lens—total posterior or exc usion of the pupil: if this be so, no communication exists oeeween the anterior and posterior aqueous chambers, the circle of the iris pro- nnrl Central depression in which is the adherent pupil, iumn^Hnr ?

Oc- clusion of the pupil is a very different case : it is when the pupil is filled by a false membrane after an iritic infiammatiou : the pupil may be, and is, very probably, also excluded, but if it be only occluded, it may not be bound dowm to the lens at all, and the aqueous humour may pass freely from the posterior into the anteiioi aqueous chamber through the oecluded pupil; in some cases I have opened out the false membrane and made a central pupil, without at all interfering with the iris. {Ophthalmic Hospital Reports, Vol. II., page 311.) If iris-adhesions be few in number, three or four perhaps, and these be not wide, if the iritis have occiUTed but once, at least two or three months pre- ■suously, and the iris seem, otherwise healthy, able and ready to dilate, as much as could be expected, considering the adhesions, under the influence of atropine, and the lattm- remedy have been fairly tried (a di'op of a strong solution placed in the eye three or four times a day for a week) and have failed, I have been in the habit of detaching them with a spatula-hook passed between the iris and the lens {Op. cit., p. 309). There is no fear of wounding the lens. But, now, unless circumstances be altogether favourable, according to the above data, I am afraid of lighting up a fr’esh iritis and of getting re-adhesions after the de- tachment has been done. The results of Corelysis, as I have called it, are altogether encom-aging in these favourable cases : the patient, not old in years or in general health, his iris fully dilated, and able to dilate, but for a few tense adhesions posteriorly by which it is distorted. But, in most cases, the adhesions are either more numerous and extensive, or they have been, just after the iritis, detached by the proper use of atropine : if this have not been and cannot be accomplished, and the adhesions be numerous or extensive, or both, the question of an iridectomy arises. If 'fusion (the pupil) be much obstructed, together with the fact of the adhesions, an iridectomy, by way of artificial pupil, must be done. Without much impainnent of vision, on the other hand, if the iritis should become recurrent, an iridectomy, larger and upwards, is required for the purpose of arresting the recurrences (see Irideetomy). If the pupil be some- what blocked, besides the synechias, and there be recurrent iritis, still it is iridectomy. The two reasons for iridectomy coexist, and probably it will be desirable to make a rather large iridectomy down and inwards; or a lai’ge iridectomy may be made in the usual upward du-ection, and, subsequently a small iridectomy, by way of artificial pupil, in the opposite direction. CATARACT. Until within a very few years, it was considered an easy matter to deter- mine, in any case of cataract, what operation should and would be done. One was a case for extraction (by a large flap, as it is now called), tmother as eer- tainly would be removed by needle-operation, and a third by linear extraction, as it was called. Now every ophthalmic Sm-geon is in search of some improved method which shall diminish the number of his unfavom’able results ,• and everything is changed for the better, or it may be for the worse. It is lathei a bold thing, as far as the profession is eoncerned, to do an extraetion as it is used to bo done, making a semicfrcidar section of the cornea, &c. Ihis state443 FORMS OF CATARACT. of uncertainty makes it also very much more difficult to say what operation is meant by name, or to venture to recommend any particular operation in any case. Forms of Cataract.—Cataract is most common in old or elderly persons, and in them it is of the kind called Hard Cataract. In younger persons, and especially in children, cataracts are comparatively soft. The Senile Cataracts are generally striated ; the streaks being very e’sident in the com- mencement of the disease, and less seen as the whole lens becomes opaque : the lenses are generally a httle amber-coloured, especially in the nucleus. The- other catai-acts are comparatively little or very indistinctly striated, and of a milky coloiir. Striae in the lens are almost invariably found to radiate from an opaque central spot to the circumference (Fig. 572), or to inoject towards the centre from various points of the circumference of the lens (Fig. 571). In fact the strife, according to the direction of the lens-fibres, of which some only have become opaque, always diverge fr’om or converge to the centre of the lens. In hard catai’acts the cortical parts, as in the normal lens, are always com- paratively soft, sometimes very soft, with a hard nucleus only ; but these are cases of secondary degeneration, by which, even the nucleus may at last become dissolved. In rare cases, an indefinite central haze, without any pattern, in- dicates the beginning of cataract. But there are not unfrequent cases of haziness of the lens, as a, senile change, or from intraocular pressiue (see “ Glaucoma ”), which must not be called cataract, for it is sometimes found together with good vision, and the haziness may disappear, or it may never go- on to a complete or real opacity of the lens. It is not, in fact, the beginning of cataractous changes. This is an important distinction ; and no doubtful case must be said to be one of cataract, unless, by examination with the ophthal- moscope, by the direct or oblique methods of illumination, strife or some certain opacities be seen in the lens, or such a degree of central haze in the same situation as to obsciue the image of the fundus, when, by direct illiunination of the ophthalmoscope, a driffht light is thrown into the eye. If any less definite rule be adopted, it will lead to inniunerable misunderstandings and false anticipations. When an eye, in which strife exist in the lens, the rest of it ^ Cataract: Op, I'ly. 5Vi2.—Commencing Cataract: Opmiiic streaks diverging from the centre."

Thus, by these two methods, we have, in doubtful cases, a means of checking our diagnosis. The cases of hazy central commencing opacity of the lens, which are to be called cataract, have been defined already. Of course, in case of a patternless non-striated opacity of the lens, far advanced, the xohole lens so evenly opaque that no part of it ■allows an inspection of the fundus, there need be no question of the existence of cataract. That the opacity is not in the cornea, or in any part behind the lens, is found at once by observing the apparent change in the relative position of the parts, when, in a good light (oblique illumination), the observer moves his head from side to side, whilst the patient keeps his eyes fixed on some other object. That it is no opacity in the pupil, is known by the use of atropine, which must of course always be used beforehand for the diagnosis of cataract, in doubtful cases, and which will not D’egularly dilate the pupil if this be not free. Of course there may be obstructed pupil and cataract behind it; but then we cannot certainly make out the latter. Or, if there have been iritic ofiusion and adhesions now freed, there will be evidence of old iritis. Or, if the opacity be in the vitreous space, it will be evidently so far behind the level ■of the pupil as to show its situation by oblique illuminatiou. Besides the idiopathic, there may be, at any time of life. Traumatic Cataract. Any wound of the lens, unless it be a slight clean cut or puncture, ■and not very deep, is followed by opacity of the wfoole lens. The sm’gical treatment of senile or hard cataract, of soft cataract, and of traumatic cases, is very luilike in many respects. In the latter only is there urgent need of any operation being done. Wounds of the eye (and lens), as of other parts, when ■they have occurred, are generally found to have been in young persons, or at least not in old people. Hence traumatic cataracts generally resemble the more the soft cataracts, so called, in being soft and whitish. In older persons, when the opacity follows a W’ouud of the lens, it wdU be found to have a hard nucleus, if it be not altogether hard. The wounded lens becomes opaque, swells up considerably, except the nucleus in old people, and in young people very rapidly, by the admission of the aqueous humour ; and herein usually lies the urgency of the call for siu-gical interference. The swelling of the whole lens and the gaping wound of the lens-capsule, by w^hich an iiTegidai* protrusion of swollen lens-matter takes place, if the lens be not whol y sw o en, press upon and rub against the his and ciliary processes in their movements, Ld set up iritis and deeper-seated inflammation, which will not, of coui-se, subside until the exciting cause is removed. Those opacities of lens, a so, which foUow blows on the eye, or severer blows on the head external wound of the eye), by which the lens is dislocated fr’om its natural connexions, so that it, and conseqiien y ^ ^ " ti. q. what tremulous), must be included among the traumatic catamets I is m traumatic cases, accidental or surgical, and in these on y, o ’ curette delay is permitted if an operation be required : the curette, the ; or the spoon must be employed at once, and as much of the cataiactoiis . onatter removed as can be without much intciterencc.445 OFEllATION FOR CATARACT. Cataracts affecting, for the most part, only tiie cortical fibres of tbe lens, bare been called Capsular. Anterior Capsular Cataract shows of course the shape of the convex surface as it is seen in front and just behind the pupil. In Posterior Capsular Cataract, there commencing, the striae- appear concave and rather yellow, not white, because they are seen through the thickness of a lens which, by age, is yellowish, as are all old lenses, cata- ractons or not; and some of them, without being cataractous, have yet a slight haze in them, nevertheless not a commencement of cataract. Secondary cataracts, consequent upon some disease of the deeper parts of the eye, are- seen commencing in the centre of the posterior surface of the lens. Capsular cataracts are only commencing cataracts, where the opacity first appears in the cortical layers. Gej^eral Remarks on Operation.—If cataract begin as a stellate central patch in the lens (Fig. 572), of course vision is at once much interfered wdtb,. and is probably benefited by the use of atropine from time to time ; whereas,, in both these respects the reverse is true, if the striae project only towards the- centre from the circumference of the lens (Fig. 571). In any case, even the most complete, of cataract, it must be remembered that, though the fundus of the eye cannot be seen by the Surgeon, the patient can always, if the case be imcomplicated, see a bright light very well, the other eye being covered, and can at once equally tell the absence of it when the hand is before it. The “ field of vision,” also, vdthin which the patient can see the light, is not re- duced in size. The patient has not the hopeless look of blindness of an amam’otie patient; he seems to look for the light and to enjoy even such vision, of light only, as he has left to him. So it is also in any case of non- nervous blindness, in leucoma, &c. Also, in the diagnosis of a case of cata- ract to be operated on, one expects to find a pupil ready to dilate weU or to- contract, a good-sized anterior chamber,—in fact, an apparently healthy eye- hut for the cataract ; no increase or decrease of tension of the globe"; no history of foiTuer pain, and so on. Arcus senilis is no reasonable objection to- operation. Cataract, unless it be traumatic, in which case the history is our guide, and the lens becomes cloudy in a few hours or days, is, of course, com- paratively of slow fomation, very slow indeed in the senile forms ; but blind- ness or partial blindness in one eye from cataract, or indeed from any other- cause, without pain or redness, is not nnfrequently discovered suddenly and by chance, by the patient accidentally closing the other eye, with which ho- has been seeing, so that the history given us may require a complete mental rctutation, lest we be led to fear any unfavourable complication not existino- in the case. ° An incompletely opaque lens must not be operated on for its extraction if the- operation can be deferred or avoided : but it cannot be in some cases of so- called congenital cataract, in which the lens opacity is central and so large as the loss of the whole lens (see, on the other hand, Iriddesis), or in siXraWe a produced L con- practically biind tL >1 ““Plotell cataractous, to have made the patient Lml a ' ““y «sc the needle once or twice before- hand, and, the whole lens haying consequently become opaque, it may be446 OPHTHALMIC SURGERY. regularly extracfcocl; or tlie risk and danger of extracting immature cataracts must be borne. (I have bad no practical experience of the extraction of cata- ract in its capsule.) For portions of transparent cortical lens-matter are sticky, and adhere to the portions of lens-capsule remaining in the eye after an extraction-operation, and to other parts ; besides, if they were not thus difficult to remove, and did not require much interference for their removal, they are transparent at the time, and so cannot be seen to be removed. The preliminary needle-operations are not very satisfactory in practice : for the ■central, very slowly progressing cataracts, equal in each eye, of old people, needle-operations are in themselves rather dangerous (see p. 452), and they take much time whilst one is striving to hasten the end ; for two needle- operations or a follovdng extraction-operation cannot be done at short intervals safely, and a senile cataract very slowly becomes opaque, even when the capsule is opened, and an iritis is never improbable. The congenital forms occur in younger, j)erhaps very young patients ; and, very often, a needle-operation having been done in order to the matm’ation for extraction of one of these ■cataracts, it will be found better to complete the operation by repeated use of the needle only. If one eye be cataractous, the other still retaining more or less the useful vision, the cataract may be operated on, if complete and otheiuvise fit for - •operation : but it cannot be right to urge the operation which may well be deferred, and need not now be done. If the seeing eye show a commencing cataract, a patient will, not unfrequently, desire the removal of the complete cataract, so as to have prospectively the use of the then practically bhnd eye when the other fails him. If the seeing eye do not show any commencement of cataract in it, the history and examination of the case require more parti- cular attention in order to its diagnosis—that it be not traumatic, or, if it be, at least that vision, independently of the cataract, be good. Perhaps operation may be advisable. I have sometimes, for cosmetic reasons, extracted a cataract in a blind (amaurotic) but otherwise, externally, healthy-looking eye. Even with the densest or darkest colom-ed cataract the patient has, in an uncomplicated case, a good perception of light and field of vision. If there should be cataracts in both eyes equally advanced, both fit for extraction, I prefer to do one first and the other a few months afterwards ; but I would not refuse to extract both at once if good and special reasons were given for my doing so. I have known both eyes to be lost after a double extraction. The object of the operations for cataract is the removal of the opaque^ lens from the axis of vision. Subsequently to the operation, instead of ^ the natural lens, an equivalent glass lens is placed lefore the eye—for near objects about 2^, and for distant objects about inches focus. The points to be ‘ observed”’are, either the getting rid of the cataract very gradually by natural process of absorption, when, in young persons, the capsule being lacerated, and the lens wounded, by operation from time to time, this can be accomplished ; or otherwise, the more rapid removal of the cataract, the opaque lens-matter, by laceration first, and then evacuating by as small an opening as possib e m the cornea; or, thirdly, by extraction of the whole at once by a sufficiently aige opening. After the operation, w^e have merely, as a general idea, to let notiiing.447 EXTRACTION OF CATARACT. by any movements bronglit about directly or indirectly, hinder the healing of the extoi’nal wound, or interrupt the complete rest and seclusion necessary for the recovery, without inflanunation, of the various internal structures that have been disturbed. Before any cataract-operation, belladonna or atropine drops may be well used, although, if the aqueous humour be let out, the iris will contract at once. At any rate the application keeps the pupil dilated iii the beginning of the operation, so that one can see well the cataract; it shows also that the pupil win dilate, and how much it wll dilate, and it inclines the pupil to dilatation during the operation and subsequently. I do not think that the iris is ever brought any more in the way of the cutting edge of the instrument used in opening the cornea, by its expansion, as is asserted. In any operation for cataract, care must be taken not to urge the vitreous humour to escape, nor inadvertently to ruptime the posterior lens-capsule, nor to bruise the iris or cornea ; and not to leave any lens-matter or clot of blood, not only in the former situation of the lens, if, without much interference, they can be thence removed, but also in the lips of the corneal opening, where they will interfere with the healing process. Foimeily, when the only method of extraction of senile cataract was by a flap involving a section of one half the circumference of the cornea, very many piecautionary lules were to be enforced that are now of little or no importance. Then cataiacts weie only extracted in the sjiring time—the time we now only considei to be best. Then, if a patient were intractable, the prognosis was very unfavourable, if the operation were done at all. Now, the administration of •chloiofoim during the operation, and perhaps of chloral subsequently, have almost set aside this objection. The great extent of the surgical woimd in the •cornea,_ then deemed indispensable, was naturally an evil prognostication if the patient were feeble, lest the section should never heal, or the cornea die of malnutrition ; or, if the patient had an habitual cough, it was ominous of vitreous escape thiough so large an opening, or of prolapse of the iris at least m the same way Ins-adhesions, always imfavourable, when no iridectomy objection to an extraction.

The Snrgel ,vith448 OPHTHALMIC SURGERY. the cxfcaction-knife, held like a pen in his other hand, again cautions the patient tells him to look towards his feet, and, resting the hand with the fourth finger on his check, enters the point of the triangular knife (Sichel’s) at the outer side of the cornea, near its margin ; then, not allowing the eye to be rolled in, he thrusts the knife rather quickly across the anterior chamber in front of the iris, and penetrates, from within, the cornea at the inner side, making the counter- puncture just opposite to and symmetrical with the first; so thaUhe upper half of the cornea is in fr’ont of the knife or before its cutting edge. The knife is now only thrust onwards as far as it can be, until the flap is completed : but this, very probably, cannot be done but in drawing tlie knife back again a little, or by little to-and-fr-o movements. Until the section is nearly completed, and the knife has passed in front of the whole iris, it must not be at all retracted; or the aqueous humour is allowed to escape, and the iris falls in front of the cuttino- edge. The lids are now freed, and the patient told to keep them gently shut After a short rest the lids are held open, but they need not be again so flrmly fixed as before ; the patient is then told again to look down, the convex back of the pricker, held horizontally, is inserted between the edges of the corneal Avound, carried down to the pupillary area, and turned Avith its point against the capsule of the lens. Then, by a few light scratches, this is freely lacerated and the instrument AvithdraAvn, AAuth its back turned upAvards, so that its point may not be caught in the iris or cornea. The eye is again closed for a minute, and when again opened, it is by the operator only, who raises the upper lid as before, but Avuthout much pressm’e against the edge of the orbit, and then he places the convex back of the curette horizontally on the skin of the lower lid near its margin. With this he makes intennittent light pressure on the globe just beloAV the ciliary region, and synchronous counter-pressure Avith the point of the forefinger, which is holding the upper lid at its margin against the ciliary region just above the corneal wound. This requires much tact and attention. If the globe be compressed too far back, the lens Avill escape Auolently, and not improbably Avith some of the vitreous humour. If it be comiAressed too far in front, the lens may be dislocated, but not out of the eye ; it may fall back into- the vitreous space and be lost. If aU go well, the upper edge of the lens is seen to come forwards through the pupil Avhich it dilates, and then rides over it and presents itself in the corneal Avound. The pressure should be kept up or increased, until little by little the lens has advanced so far that at least more than half is vdthout the AVOund. Then, the pressure exerted being little and equal, the lens, if it remain in the wound, may be rolled out sideAvays Avith the tip of the middle finger of the hand which steadies the upper lid. This is better than increasing the pressure up to the final evacuation of the lens, as vitreous humour may folloAv it, and better than omitting altogether the pressure exerted, or much of the softer cortical parts of the lens are likely to be detached and left in the lips of the Avound and in the anterior chamber. Any such are in the next place removed Avith the curette, if it can be done without much interference. If the iris be noAV inclined to prolapse, it may be pressed' gently back with the small spatula, made for the purpose, held horizontally. The instruments, knife, pricker, &c., are all held horizontally ; so that if the eye, ill controlled by the patient or Surgeon, should, in any stage, roll up- Avards, as it has a tendency to do, the instrument in hand may not pass down-449 VON GRAFE'S OPERATION FOR CATARACT. G a ■wards into the deeper parts of the eye, but be forced out of it by this move- ment. The iris no'w being in position, the pupil clear, and nothing being left between the edges of the corneal -wound or within the palpebral aperture, the lids are gently closed, a smooth oblong piece of linen rag, with a slit in it for the nose, is placed over both eyes, then a little -s^-ool is put in the orbits over the rag, and a bandage over it round the head. The patient is kept in bed for a day or two, and fed -with spoon meat. He may then get up and walk about the room a little. Extraction with a Traction-Instrument.—In this operation chloroform is given, and a wire speculum to keep open the lids, and forceps to hold the eye, are used. The Surgeon either thrusts in at the upper part of the sclerotico- corneal junction a lance-shaped knife in his right hand, or, what is preferable, the point of a Sichel’s extraction-knife, at the right extremity of the incision which he intends to make in this part of the eye, and, holding it almost vertically, he cuts on as far as he intends, perhaps one-fourth of the circumference, to the left. He then makes a eonsiderable iridectomy, larger than for artificial pupil, and not so large as in a case of glaucoma. Then -with the pricker he lacerates the lens-capsule. He then passes the end of the traction-instrument (Critchett’s spoon) between the lips of the wound, vertically, to the upper edge of the lens and within the capsule, rather posteriorly; and, remembering anatomically the emre of the hinder capsule, he passes it along the curve just behind the lens itself. He then tilts forwards the end of the spoon, and, watching that the lens is coming with it, he begins to withdraw the instrument and the lens together. If the spoon will not go on between the lens and its capsule, it may be introduced perhaps a little sideways; and as soon as it has begun to pass between the two, it may be passed aU the way ■without difficulty. If the lens is being pushed before the point of the spoon, instead of the latter passing behind it, it will be seen, the front surface of the lens being purposely watched, to be passing downwards; and we must try some other way, sideways, as above directed, or farther backwards, and not of course push on the instrument so as to displace the whole lens downwards. The piece of iris excised must be so large that what IS left does not become compressed between the spoon and the cornea, in theremoval of thelens ; and the corneal opening must be so large that not muc c ragging is required.

That it is equally unnecessary as a rule, even with the smaller opening, and very undesirable on all accounts if its use can be avoided, to introduce any tract!on-instrument within the eye, as is done in the operation last described. (If Von Griife used any such aid in any case, it was a small blunt hook instead of a spoon.) The incision is made with a knife like a sharp-pointed tenotomy-knife, by puncture and counter-puiictmc, of perhaps one-fourth of the circle of the sclerotico-comeal junction. Attached to the corneal flap is left a flap of conjunctiva to cover the incision. An iridectomy is made, and, of course, the lens-capsule is lacerated in the usual manner. To evacuate the lens, the back of the curette is pressed against the sclerotic margin of the incision, and the necessary counter-pressure below is made with the fixing forceps. The cortical lens-matter generally remains to be removed, after the nucleus has come out or has been removed by the hook placed under and around it. Yon Griife says that the advantages are the following:—1st, the incision is linear; in consequence of which the co-aptation of the edges of the wound is more perfect than is the case after a flap incision, and there is less risk of gaping of the wound, permitting loss of 'sdtreous humour after the performance of the operation : 2nd, it is peripheral, passiug chiefly through a vascular texture, in which the healing process occurs more rapidly than in a non-vascular tissue : 3rd, the incision may be viewed as subconjunctival, being covered by a flap of conjunctiva ; 4th, a portion of iris is removed, and thus no prolapse of his can occur, and the tendency to iritic inflammation is diminished : 5th, in most cases no instrument is introduced to assist the evolution of the lens, and, when such is necessary, a hook merely is employed; and 6 th, the after-treatment is of short dmration. Now probably no extraction by Von Grafe’s method is ever done in all its stages, exactly as Von Griife used to do it, and no operator is free from all prejudice in favom’ of his own particular modifications, which indeed to him only, it may be, are advantages in operating ; but some few practical remarks as to my own experience of this now estabhshed method of performing the most important of the capital operations in eye surgery may be useful. The pupil is under the influence of atropine. The anaesthetic preferred may be feai’lessly given ; and, the patient being well under its influence, a spring speculum (Fig. 564, a) is introduced between the lids, and the eye itself steadied by grasping a considerable fold of conjunctiva at some distance below the lower margin of the cornea, ivith the toothed forceps (Fig. 564, V). For either eye to be operated on, I stand, as usual, behind the head of the patient lying on the couch, and hold the forceps generally in my left hand, because, in my way of making the corneal section, the knife for either eye may be as conveniently held in the right hand. I prefer a Sichel’s knife, as m iridectomy (p. 436), in the present operation ; not that there is anything to be .feared in wounding the lens, or that it cuts better than Von Griife’s, but because A\ith it a section of the cornea can be made less obliquely in all its extent th.m by puncture and counter-puncture, which, in iridectomy for glaucoma, is also an advantage ; and especially because, with so small a section of the cornea as is now made, the counter-puncture extremity of the section, when a counter-punctuierO.V GRAPE'S OPERATION FOR CATARACT. 45^ G G is effected, milcesso small an opening in iM anterior chamUr as compared milk its size extenialhj, and tliis is a deception, for of coiu-se its least dimensions are only practically available in the evacuation of a lens. Ihe point of the knitc bcin.^ directed towards the centre of the pupil, the cornea is transfixed at its uppe“r mar<^in at the right hand extremity of the intended incision ; the point of the knife is then carried on between the cornea and iris along the upper circum- ference of the anterior chamber. No counter-punctm-e is made, but the knife is cpiickly brought into a more vertical position, and with a firm hand, and <iuickly, by little to-and-fi.-o movements, the section is continued as far as need be to the left extremity of the intended opening. That this extremity may be square like the other, and not at all oblique, the knife should be either di-aira out at the end of the section, held quite vertically ; or, the knife being- held horizontally, the edge is brought upwards and forwards, and its point is ■made so to cut its way out suddenly at one stroke. The comeal opening should lie as large as one-thhd of the circumference of the cornea ; it had much better lie unnecessarily large, than a little too small in any case ; it is easily extended at •either end, if it should seem to be necessary, by re-introduction of the point of the knife into the anterior chamber, and cutting right or left. No conjunc- tival flap is left to cover the wound : it is doubtful if, when it has been left, 'the corneal wound heals any the better. A considerable iridectomy is as usual made (p. 448), and the lens-capsule opened (p. 447). To evacuate the lens, the back of the cinette, held horizontally, is now pressed on the globe between the lower margin of the cornea and the point below it, at which the globe is held with the fixing forceps. By moderate pressure Ijackwards, •gi-adually increasing, and by a succession of httle sliding movements from below upwards, never reaching the edge of the cornea, the upper margin of the lens wiU beg-in to protrude at the corneal opening, and dilate it : as soon as it is ■certainly ad.vancing out of the eye, the shding movements must be discontinued, and the simple, very gradually increasing backward, and upward pressure alone is to be kept up on the eye or the lens ; its largest part not having passed the •opening, may recede as well as advance alternately with each up and down movement of the curette, and the extraction might never be completed. This steady backward pressm-e is to be kept up patiently until the largest part of the lens is certainly quite outside the corneal opening, when the whole body of the lens -will probably fall aside out of the way, or it may be pushed aside, only not with the curette, for the pressure must not be altogether intermitted. At least we are no more concerned about it, and have only now to care for the ■complete remo^’al of all the softer cortical lens-matter left behind in the an- terior chamber. The curette is continuously pressing on the lower front part ■of the globe, and now again the sliding movements upwards may be recom- menced, still not reaching forwards beyond the lower margin of the cornea ; by this the viti-eous body advances stiU more, and the lower part of the iris and cornea arc brought into contact with it first, and soon, the prcssinc and uprvards sliding movements being continued, the lower margin of the pujril is seen to be quite clear and black. The curette may now be slid a little up on to the lower part of the coimea ; the opaque soft lens-matter will then rise higher, and so gradually, as it is seen to advance, and the clear pupillary space to become larger and larger, the curette pursues it until it is just all outside452 OlUITUALMIC SURGERY. the corneal opening. At this stage, of course, the slightest continuance of pressure would lead to an escape of vitreous humour. If the curette be at any- time slid upwards too soon, so as to got in advance of some of the soft lens- matter, the tendency is to push it hack from the corneal outlet, and it will probably never be made to escape, or vitreous humour will be lost. Xo frag- ments of lens-matter must bo left in the corneal wound or between the lids. A drop of atropine may be placed between the lids. A piece of fine linen (about G X 3 inches), is placed over hoih eyes, a little pad of fine wool is placed in each orbital space, and over this is fitted a Liebreich’s bandage of elastic knitted cotton, and tied comfortably tight. Sichel’s moderately pointed knife cuts through the cornea better than the very obtuse keratome, or the very acute Von Griife’s extraction-knife ; and in the way it is recommended to be used, the inner and outer openings of the cornea may be made of the same size, square at both extremities, less obliquely through the coats, and the pupillary area is never transgressed. The incision may be less easily done, and less rapidly than is a single movement straight forward with a cutting instrument; but, for the curved incision, a previous determination of the line to be followed and a fiim free hand only are needed. Escape of the vitreous humour is the most important mishap in a cataract extraction operation that is likely to occur. It is not that the loss of any small portion of vitreous humom‘ is in itself very prejudicial, but it is not often that a very small portion only does escape; if a little escape, it is- probably followed by more ; and the quantity is hardly recognised at the time. If vitreous humour be lost in the operation, it infiuences the ultimate result unfavourably ; the eye is so much the less safe as an organ of vision hereafter,, though the proximate result of the operation is successful. In the serous fluid occupying the place of the aqueous chambers and of the lens and the vitreous humour that is lost, the iris falls back out of its place, leaving a very deep anterior chamber, as it were, and has also probably got adhesions posteriorly to some new. false membranes. And all synechise are, as I have said, in any case, incompatible with the prospect of safety for the future result. But if vitieous humour escape in any cataract operation hefore the lens, or that portion of the cataract which it was intended to evacuate by the operation, the operation is. seriously maived; for if then the lens-matter be removed—and, the vitreous body having got precedence, it very likely cannot be,—more and more of the vitre- ous hmnoiu’is allowed to escape by necessity. Even if the major part of the lens be after all removed, the prolapsed vitreous body will retain some considerable- fragments and press them aside against the iris and ciliary body, and so "s eiy likely mechanically set up inflammation. The Surgeon is bound to be alert in detecting the least tendency to or beginning of prolapse of the vi treous body : t e- opaque lens-matter, instead of advancing, perhaps recedes a little, and soon a smaU transparent bead appears in the corneal opening. This opening veiy likely is too small, and needs enlarging; but after this, when the has shoAvn itself once in the wound, still it would be c^angerons to ^ evacuation of the cataract by pressure ; a sharp hook lor a j ‘ spoon or the suction-curette for soft lens-matter, may be vitreous humour will escape at the close of the operation, aftci the lens iiasNEEDLE-OFERATION FOR CATARACT. 453 been removed; this is insomuch less serious; but at all events, if vitreous humour have escaped before the lids are closed and bandaged, the escaping vitreous body- should be di\-ided across close to the corneal opening with a pair of scissors ; then the wire speculum is raised a little from off the surface of the globe to remove its weight, and to prevent the action of the orbicularis upon it; and then, this muscle being at the time tolerably passive, the speculum is removed and the eye quietly closed. In the old semicircular flap-extraction operation, vitreous himiour was, perhaps, more I'requently lost than it is in Von Griife’s operation ; but then, in the latter operation, it is more likely to anticipate the evacuation of the lens. Dislocated Lens.—If the whole lens, or the greater part of it, have fallen into the -\-itreous chamber, the attempt is to be made to transfix it with a long noodle or sharp hook, and remove it; but, lost to sight—and the ophthalmoscope cannot, in this stage of the proceedings, be employed—it can seldom be reached. Sometimes after a blow, a lens, perhaps already cataractous, becomes separated from its attachments, and, in its capsule, dislocated into the anterior chamber or the Vtreous space. In the former situation especially it must be removed at once (because of the mechanical irritation and consequent inflammation of iris and ciliary processes to be anticipated), by a sufficiently large opening in the cornea, made with the point of a cataract-knife—care being taken mean- Avhile not to jness the lens back again through the pupil: if this be a^'oided, it will in all probability readily enough escape when the incision is completed. I hav e seen a lens half-dislocated through the pupil, and held by the sphincter iridis. The iritis set up in this case was, of course, very acute. A lens, dis- located into the \itreous space, if quite separated and fallen to the bottom of this space, would be probably visible with the ophthalmoscope even although it were transparent, and had not yet become cataractous. It must be brought for V aid into the anterior chamber and removed by use of a long needle or a shaip hook, introduced through the sclerotic or in any way most convenient to secure it, if it can be done ; but it is very difficult to do this, especially if the lens be still transparent. If the blow have burst the globe, the lens will be loinid in some cases beneath the conjunctiva, external to the globe. The Tuptm-e of the globe is probably in or just behind the ciliary region ; and the lens 18 lying beyond it, further fr-om the cornea. It is seen as a rounded semi- transparent prominence, probably under the upim- lid and far hade, and it is easily removed by opening the conjunctiva underneath which it is lying. Sometimes a lens or cataract is hall-dislocated into the vitreous chamber, that is to say, it is held still partly by the suspensory hgament, as by a hinge, and, fixed here it can move to and fro ; it also, of course, must be at once removed, incleecl, a lens, cataractous or not, dislocated, or half-dislocated in any dii-ec- tion, IS to be rcmoved—if it can be done ; for the lens, if transpai-ent, is not onnmiP '' probability it must soon become is the method to be preferred for soft is not oftL^fl^ age, so that we have only to determine which is a soft cataract.

If a middle-aged or elderly person have cataract, it is, as in infants and young persons bluish-white, rather uniform454 OFHTIIALMIG SUJWEliY. in colour; it has no liaixl nucleus ; aud, especially, it is not at all amber- coloured. 11‘, in any cataract case, a needle-operation be necessary, it should be done without much delay. The earlier in life, and the sooner after the commencement of the cataract, the more quickly it will be absorbed afterwards. Infants, unless at the time very young or sickly, should be operated on ; oi- their eyes, Avhen they begin to observe objects, get wandering oscillatoiy move- ments as a confirmed habit in aftcr-hfe ; and infants particularly well bear the risks of swollen lenses. Though the lenses of young persons, and still more of children, swell up much more, and more rapidly than do those of adults, or still more of old people, when their capsules are lacerated accidentally or by surgical operation, the iris and ciliary processes in them seem very httle inclined to take on inflammatory action by the pressure and mechanical in-itation of the,, in these cases very soft, swollen lens-matter. The immediate result of the use of the needle in this operation is, that the cataractous lens becomes very much increased in bulk by the admission of the aqueous humoiw within its capsule. Operation.—The needles used should be very fine, and should not let the aqueous humour escape beside them. The pupil is to be dilated with atropine,, which must be constantly employed in these cases dmiug all the surgical treat- ment. An anassthetic is sometimes necessaiy. A stop-speculum is inserted between the lids, to keep them apart; and a httle fold of conjunctiva and subconjunctival tissues is to be seized ^vith the toothed forceps just below the cornea, or opposite to the point at which the needle is to be introduced, as may be most convenient, to steady the eye. The needle, held in the other hand, is made to enter the anterior chamber through the cornea, at some part near the margin, wherever it may seem best, probably at the upper and outer part; it must not be passed very obliquely through the coats of the cornea, or in its use they will be much twisted. The point of the needle, having passed the- pupillary margin, is then carried on down to the centre of the anterior sm’face- of the lens, which is nearer to the cornea, according to the youth of the patient, and made to enter its substance a little way, and the capsule is tom open by moving the needle-point in various dhections to and fro. If the operation be performed for the first time in a very yomig patient, the lens is so soft that it is very readily broken up by the to-and-ft’o movements, and by rotation of the needle (driUing), but it soon afterwards swells up very much, and therefore but little should be done. If the needle be passed far into the substance of ther lens towards the nucleus, it wiU, unless the patient be very young, become- fixed in the denser substance, and the lens will move about as a whole on the- needle, and may become dislocated. If the patient be older, or have beeix before operated on, one needle will not, perhaps, freely lacerate the tough anterior capsule, and two may be required. The fixing forceps must then be- entrusted to an assistant; or, one needle being entered some distance m the- anterior chamber, it may be used, the patient being then quiet, for an mstant, as a fixing point, holding the eye forwards, until the needle in the other hand has been also entered, and then the eye is perfectly under command. If one- needle only be required to be used, it is better to use neither speculum nor forceps, but the fingers of the other hand (Fig. oGG) instead of both, unless the eye be small and deep in the orbit. If two needles aie to )c use , n> speculum must be employed, and then, choosing an opportunity when the eyeNEEDLE-OPERiiTlON FOR CATARACT. 455 is still, one needle, and then quickly that in the other hand, is introduced ; and the operation is completed with the two needles, opening out the lens, whilst at the same time they keep the eye steady. The needle-operation is always the best for infantile cataract. So, in child- hood, if one of these so-called congenital cataracts have been left so long for operation, it should be broken up with the needle for its ultimate gradual removal by the natural process of absorption. Children and young adults hai’dly ever have any other kind of cataract than the congenital, unless it be the result of some wound or mechanical injury of the lens : then also, if the lens have become opaque, unless already the lens-capsule be sufficiently lace- rated, the needle must be employed at once, and again and again whenever it may seem to be necessary to expedite and complete the process of removal, after a longer or shorter time, according to the rapidity with which the absorp- tion proceeds ; and this will be more or less, in inverse proportion to the age of the patient. Though the anterior chamber is so small and the iris so close upon the lens, in infancy, still it seems that nothing is to be feared. In no juvenile cataract will it ever be necessary to make a large opening and remove the lens as a whole. If the lens, wounded either accidentally, or by the surgical operation, swell much, or, Avhatever swelling occurs, should there be any symptoms of inflam- mation of the ii’is and ciliary processes, more at least than a very slight redness in the ciliary region and no marked tension, which may be disregarded, (and this is more hkely the older the patient may be,) the process of absorption is arrested ; the lens-matter, or some of it, must for both reasons be removed'at once by use of the broad needle and suction-curette, and if among the diffluent lens-matter and aqueous hiunoui- be found a sohd nuclear portion of the lens remaining, the corneal opening should be enlarged with a knife for its removal with a scoop, if without one it will not escape. Of course, unless it follow an accidental wound, the lens should not be so much exposed by so extensive a laceration of its capsule as to admit of so much swelling that inflammation follows ; but this cannot always be calciflated beforehand. In first operating m any case on an eye by the needle-operation, imless, perhaps, in infants and very young children, it is well not to make more than a small opening in the lens-capsule, for fear of this mechanical irritation and after inflammation ; also 1 would not extensively at first break up the lens within this opening, or the consequent swelling may open out the whole lens, though the opening made in the capsule, by the needle, was not large. Within a week, even in the older patients, m any case, I think, the greatest amount of swelling consequent on neeffie-operation will be reached. After that, so long as the bulging lens- matter shows in the wound it may be left-the pupil being merely kept consffintly dilated with atropine drops or belladonna lotion, whilst absorption 18 going on. ^ In a few weeks, more or less, the lens-matter, which was bulging, no lono-er surface is perhaps rather flattened, and the situation of the lens-capsule is somewhat excavated. The needle then ould he used again ; and at the second or at least the third time of usino- it after siifficient mter^nls, there is no fear of the remaining lens-matter srilinc: enough to bnng about any infl„n,„.ation, and it is much more456 OPHTHALMIC SUllGER F. that a fragment of lens should be detached and so set up inflammation. Hence the needle may be used in the latter operations more and more freely each time. And the needle must be employed whenever the bulging out lens-matter no longer protrudes, and the wound in the lens-capsule seems to be a little exca- vated ; for, if the repetition be long deferred, the lens-capsule in front may become so tough that it can never be thoroughly broken uj^, and it will be di-awn in at the edges of the sm-gical wound, enclosing some portions of white opaque lens-matter which, if not in the centre so as to obstruct vision, will show when the pupil is large, and are a defect, in appearance, in the good result to be expected from timely interference. If the capsule be toughened, the lens will perhaps move about on the end of the needle as it is moved about, and the lens-capsule is no more torn open. A second needle must then be introduced from the opposite side of the cornea, and then with it the lens may be held and steadied while the needle in the other hand tears open in various directions the capsule, and breaks up the lens-substance freely ; or, if it be very tough, the two needles, introduced from each side of the cornea, and meeting at the same aperture in the lens-capsule, may have their points sepa- rated, so as to make a large rent in it. The posterior capsule is throughout to be carefully preseiwed from any accidental wound. If it should be wounded, whilst the lens is still bulky and softened, and it let the vitreous body come forward and protrude in the midst of the lens-matter, the vitreous body pushes aside the fragments of broken up lens against the iris and ciliary processes, and mechanically sets up inflammation, which commonly ends badly. It is very difflcult—if not impossible—to remove snch fragments by the curette or the syringe, without injuring the vitreous body, which lies in the way ; it vdll, however, be better to lose some vitreous humom- than to leave much lens- matter pressing upon the iris, &c., if such a mishap should occur, and the fragments can be removed. In the final stage, however, of “solution” or keratonyxis (as the needle-operation has been called), very httle of the lens being left, the carefully preserved joosterior lens-capsule has not unfrequently to be pmposely torn open, and a rent, through which the vitreous body pro- trudes, to be made ; for small opaque fragments often remain upon this cap- sule, after most of the lens-matter has been removed little by httle ; or delicate grey webs and streaks and puckerings appeal' in or upon it, visible, perhaps, only by nse of the oblique illumination, and yet interfering very much with good vision. There are now no fragments of lens that can be displaced and excite inflammation. In old people, or even in adults, a needle-operation is a very tedious process. The lens-matter, though swollen, has iiTegular hard margins, and will very likely set up inflammation of the iris and ciliary processes, &c. A detached fragment of the hard senile cataract left after an extraction will be very likely to do the same ; and elderly people, in any inflammation of the eye, are always more likely fr’om their age to get a glaucomatous complication of the disease. But if a young adult have one useful eye, a cataract in the other may be got rid of by repeated use of the needle, doing each time very little with it; and the process, tedious as it is, is safe from the greater risks of extraction ; and the inconvenience of the delay, in such a case, "will not be^ felt. ni ^ is process of solution thei'e should in any case appeal to be incicasc tensionSUCTIOy OPERATION FOR CATARACT. 457 (T. 1.) even though the pupil be fully dilated (atropine of course being used) and there be no ciliary redness, the swollen lens-matter must be at once evacuated, and perhaps an iridectomy upwards done at the same time. Suction-Operation.—Fluid cataracts are sometimes, but not otten, touncl ; the whole contents of the lens-capsule being evacuated into the anterior chamber when the capsule is torn open with a needle. They occur, perhaps, in young ndults for whom avo should use the needle. They look like soft cataracts and they can hardly or unlrequently be distinguished from ordinary soft cataracts, besides that from their rarity they are not expected. They appear of an uniform colour. SomeAvhat like them surgically are the cataracts of diabetic patients, though these latter are not fluid, only very soft; so that, after the needle has been used, although the patient be middle aged, the whole of the lens is mixed up in the aqueous humour, and can be, and indeed must be, remoA-ed forthwith. In this I am speaking of my own experience, in which I have had a succession of cases of diabetic cataract, all ahke, and all success- fully ti’eated by suction, at one operation, as described below. I do not say that all diabetic cataracts must be like those to Avhich I refer : they were of a bluish milky colom', A’ery large, apparently pressing fonvards the iris, with some broad, conA'ergent, indistinctly glistening striae anteriorly, rather lighter in colour than the body of the lens itself. The syringe is also available in the •cases of woimds of the lens in children or young adults, in which, soon after the injury (or a fh’st needle-operation), in a week or thereabouts, the whole lens is much swoUeu altogether, and in cases AA'here, by a subsequent needle- ■operation, it has been completely broken up and has become uniformly swollen and diffluent. In the youngest patients, it is most probable that the natural process of absorption AviU suffice to effect the removal of the lens-matter Avith- out risk of inflammation. If it should be altogether very much swollen, even if there be no dangerous symptoms, it is well to hasten the cure by evacuating at least the major part of the soft cataract. Not imfrequently the wound in the cornea, through AAfflich the lens was wounded, will be the most convenient way of reaching the lens ; and often, when a soft swollen lens-mass is pressing ■outAvards the lips of the w'ound, the thin Aveak recent cicatrix retaining it may be easily traversed with the end of the suction-ciuette, and so it may be alto- gether removed without any cutting instrument. The operation is a very -admirable one, and, if practised carefully in the above-mentioned cases, it deserves more consideration than it has obtained. Diffluent lenses used to be •CA'acuated by the ciuette ; a sufficiently large opening haAdng been made Avith a broad needle, the ciuette Avas introduced into the anterior chamber, and a ^ush of the aqueous hmnour and lens-matter took place, and then, by various little movements to-and-fro, a little more of the lens-matter Avas made to floAV along the groove of the instrument. Noav, in such a case, by using the syringe, with the end like that of a curette, but made tubular, keeping the point of it an the posterior aqueous chamber, and the oriflee being forwards, avc can, without any moA’ements endangering the iris, si«'7c ouf the u'hole of the cUffiueni lens-matter. The corneal opening is made Avith a broad needle, Avhich should be made to enter also the lens and lacerate the capsule, if necessary. It should be large enough easily to admit the suction-curette ; and the point of this, Avhen once introduced, should be brought into the centre of the 'piqnllari/ area,OPHTHALMIC SURGEliY. 458 mid tlion carried back until it is in contact with the posterior hns-caj)sute, '1 ben there, the point should not le moved ahoid, or it may draw in the iris, or afterwards the cornea, with the lens-matter, or bruise the iris. The patient being recumbent, and the point of the instrument kept Avell back in the pos- terior aqueous chamber, in the hollow of the posterior capsule, all the diffluent lens-matter will fall towards the orifice and be drawn in succession into the syiinge. If, in a case of a swollen accidental or surgical traumatic cataract, the burgeon cannot be sure that the lens-substance is completely dissolved in the aqueous humoiu’, after a lapse ol time amply suffleient according to the age of the jiatient (the older the patient, the slower is the cataract in becoming dissolved in the aqueous humom-), it will be better to defer the use of the syringe until some evidence of irritation, redness in the ciliary region, &c., shows itself. In no case would it be necessary to wait more than a week or ten days : but, if the lens-matter be imperfectly dissolved, some fragments clog the small tube of the syringe, and then it is necessary to remove the instrument from the eye, and reverse the action so as to force out the frag- ment causing the obstruction in the tube of the syringe. This necessitates the introduction and reintroduction and various movements of the syringe, almost as much as used to be required mth the old curette in the anterior chamber. The suction-ciu'ctte is invaluable, especially for the total remo^'al of the whole lens at once, without any previous needle-operation on an earlier day, by a very small opening in the cornea, in diabetic and other quite exceptional cases of cataract; and next in those in which the preliminaiy operation (or an accidental wounding of the lens) has, after a little while, made it possible and desirable thus to remove the lens, or a great part of it, in a large number of cases ; for, with the suction-curette, the corneal opening need be only very small, and the parts ooncerned little disturbed. The great amount of swelling of the cataractous lens-substance, and the evenness of its bluish-white tint, are, together with the history of the case and the age of the patient considered, the best indications that can be obtained of the practicability of a suction- operation ; but if, in any case, the operation should prove to be impracticable, it has no way precluded a subsequent traction-operation with a larger opening in the cornea. It is also, in different cases, sometimes useful in other opera- tions for cataract, in cases where the old-fashioned open cimette would have been used, so as to employ suction-power instead of traction, &c. Whenever a cataract has been removed by flap-extraction or smaller corneal section, and soft cortical matter and shi'eds of lens-capsule remain, less injury to the parts is probably done by use of the suction-curette than by the old cirrette or other traction instrument; but the latter must be used in many cases when the cor- tical matter, «&c., is not very soft, and the suction-curette becomes clogged. As to the shreds of lens-capsule and lens-matter involved, the grooved curette cannot possibly remove them, and considerable fragments of lens- matter ean- not be removed with either the suction or the grooved curette so readily as with a scoop. The grooved curette acted best when, with the first gush of aqueous humour along its gi’oove, the opportunity was taken to let pass along' with the aqueous humour as much as possible of the diffluent lens. J^on, with the suction-cmette there is no voluntary gush along the tube of the459 SECONDAliY OPERA TIONS. instrument ■when it is introduced, only beside it, perhaps, and the space beside it is not large enough to lot pass any but the smallest fragments that may come in the way ; so, not to lose the opportunity gi’^'en by the natural force of expulsion and the gi’eater quantity of fluid contents, we must begin to employ the suction-power as soon as possible after we have entered the suction-curette in the anterior chamber, or the aqueous humour Avithout the lens-matter may be running to Avaste. Secondary Operations for Cataract.—Opaque matters on the capsule of the lens, remaining after removal of cataract by any one of the various fore- mentioned methods, veiy often necessitate a final operation ; without Avhich,, indeed, the promised good result of the operation—for there has been no iritis- in these simple cases—is in abeyance. When it is plain that this bttle opera- tion will be required, it should be done as soon as all redness, remaining after the primary and major operation, has disappeared from the eye ; for, if it be long deferred, the capsule becomes so tough that it cannot be torn through Avithout much force, or the use of two needles, and even then, perhaps, a rent insufficiently large is made ; and, moreover, the force used, aud the draggings made on the parts around, may light up an inflammation which will after all close the aperture made in the capsule. It is seldom indeed that, Avith a pupil AA^idely dilated, one cannot see, after remoA'al of the lens, some opaque patches and streaks left upon the posterior capsule in situ ; but these are very often only found in the margin, and there chiefly in most cases where they are generally distributed. Others consist of shi’ivelled-up remains of the anterior lens-capsule, and of traces of the cataract itself; and yet, althono-fi these may be considerable, if they have been draAvn away towards the circuni- erence Avith the retracted capsule, as they are usually, aU ways behind the iris, when not und^ the mflmme of airofim, they wiU require no needle-operation! If the central parts be clear, there would seem to be no obstruction to vision, and the patient should have good sight; but, as in doubtful commencino- mtaT aTil T', “amination-the ophthalmoecopio rmetimef '’W ™P<=rfeot, oblique illumination, by whic{ any opacitmo renir°^"™® oapsule is detected as (without nrJ- ^ ^ opening to be made in it with a needle Bv the dra»™S; awT “ T ““5' »“l*q«ontly left to bo capll t “‘Tus ft y™-™ntly, by the shrivelling of the lacerated ^ ® “““ P”’'‘ “"d nnobstructed. forceps • or*if''o'iiB°*’'^'u'*'’'^ “toadied by use of the wire speculum and toothed passes into IlnterL 1 , 1 i wherever it may be most c^n “M'ginnl part of the cornea, a cataract-needle the point nT"r obliquely through the coats. sule,.md so far L, toSf ^ ■“ then brought down towards the cap- whieh it has been entered “oross it to the side opposite to that at passing the instrument anv hi tl ^ oapsu e is then penetrated : and, without towards the side at which H hat b! ‘’’l.P'”'"'' b»ck, and winch It has been introduced.

And Ave may not merely regard the opening that is to be made Avithout considering the force used: the operation must be done Avithout any dragging upon the ciliary processes and surrounding parts, or iritis or e\-en ophthalmitis may bo set up in the eye. Sometimes after cataract-operation, a fragment of opaque lens-matter, en\'e- loped in capsule, remains in the pupil; as it is a deformity, but chiefly be- cause it obstructs A'ision, it must be displaced or removed. With a needle it may be detached at the parts at AA'hich it is least firmly attached in the cir- cumference, and then it may be pushed aside, and perhaps it Avill be retracted behind the iris, and remain out of sight, and, as regards the patient, olfer no obstruction to vision : it does no harm and may be left there, but, if it remain very loose, sometimes or ahvays appearing in the pupil, and interfering Avith Adsion, or if in the former needle-operation it seem to be but slightly connected Avith the surrounding parts, then it may be removed Avith iris or cannula for- ceps, introduced by a sufficient opening made in the margin of the cornea Avith a knife or a broad needle. This may only be done if its attachments be Aveak ; if they be strong, perhaps they can be cut through fii’st of all Avith iris or cannula scissors, and the forceps then used. With iris-forceps aud iris- scissors Ave haA'C much more poAver and certainty than Avith the cannula instru- ments ; but for their use aa'b must, of course, have a larger corneal opening. Sometimes, and not unfrequently, an opaque band or tAvo are found behind the pupil, after cataract-operation, in the level of the posterior capsule ; if one of these be in the Avay of Adsion, it may, if recent and not thick, and if it cannot be broken through AAdth a single needle, be twisted and broken by two needles introduced from opposite sides, or dndded with scissors : then it AviU retract and remain out of sight. The tAvisting operation is somewhat dangerous, by reason of the dragging it may cause upon the ciliary processes, &c. Expe- rience in this and in other eye-operations only will inform us how much force may be used ; but if the eye be otherwise useless, some operation must be done at all eA^ents, and I think in such cases probably it is best boldly to make a quarter section of the cu'ciunference of the cornea with a knife, then to introduce the points of a pair of iris-scissors, having one point blunt to be kept next the cornea, and the other sharp to be thrust within the pupil, behind the band, and so to divide it and leave it in two parts. The can- nula instruments, forceps and scissors, are introduced by making for them, with a broad needle, a preliminary opening in the margin of the cornea, w'herever it may be most convenient, not very obliquely, or in use they AA'ill bruise the cornea, and only just sufficiently large so as to retain as much as possible of the aqueous humour, and as large a space in the anterior chamber as may be for the use of the instruments. _ 1 • • • In all the above cases, I have presumed that there are no considerable u'ltic adhesions, certainly not any occlusion of the pupil; if either exist, it is pro- bably best to make an iridectomy in the situation best adapted for an artihcia pupil, and if by this, behind it, some remains of the cataract be exposed, o incise the membrane, or to divide it Avith scissors.461 extirpation of the eyeball. extiri*-A.tion of the eyeball. If an eye bo rendered useless, especially if it be in consequence of some former iniury it is probably best to remoye it ; certainly if any irritation or inflammation exist in the other eye, or if it be unsightly, or if there be any foreiom body remaining Avithin it, or if the patient be one who cannot pro- bably at a future time, at once obtain good advice lyhen sympathetic irritation may haye arisen. In the latter case, that of the labouring man or of the needle- woman the sight of the seeing eye will be secured ; and, then, even if the natient’eannot afford an artificial eye for the future, the deformity of a vacant palpebral aperture is comparatively of very little importance. But if, when the least occasion may arise, the patient be in the way of good advice, and be duly convinced of the importance of not neglecting any trifling and transitory pains and obscurations in the sound eye, and the one lost be also in appearance an eye, it may be left. In some cases, that are not urgent, the value of appearances may turn the scale in determining whether or not to recommend extirpation. An eye should certainly be excised if it be blind and painful, or, if sympathetically without pain, the other eye be threatened in .the least degree. The operation of excision is iir(jently called for, in cases of intraocular morbid growths, as soon as detected Avith the ophthalmoscope or otherwise ; when a foreign body is known to remain within the eye, and camiot be ex- tracted from it, even if the eye be not quite blind, or but very little painful or tender at the time ; also at once, in cases of suppuration of the eye after' ophthalmitis, or of hEemorrhage and clot filhng the eye, at the time Avhen an operation has been done. A lost, blind, and painful glaucomatous eye, or a glaucomatous eye that is blind and has been painful, should be removed ; for in the latter case it is useless, and the pain Avill return ; or, if iridectomy Avere to be done to prevent the recuiTence of pain, it is a blind eye at all events, and rather unsightly. The probability of much pain to be experienced in a disorganised globe would decide the question in faA'our of the operation. And, Avheiiever it is to be recommended, it must be strenuously urged ; and, if it be not adopted, the responsibility of the decision must be plainly made to rest A\dth the patient. Sympathetic irritation in a blind eye aftecting- the other may be allayed ; but the sympathetic inflammation folloAving the loss of an eye for practical purposes, by old injury or deep-seated inflammation, is one of the most teirible and intractable and destructiv'e with Avhich we are acquainted. And if it be subdued, it Avill recur : each time Avith some more impairment of vision aftenvards. An eye totally blind Avill never see again. And, Avith a good artificial eye adapted, the defomiity of the extiiqiation Avill not be much. In this place it seems to bo necessary to distinguish between blindness as the Avord is used by ophthtdmologists—a Avant of perception of light—and blindness in the common acceptation of the term. By blindness is generally meant no more than a greater or less degi’ee of Avant of useful vision, but real blindness of an eye is only to be diagnosed in some such Avay as the following. The palm of the Surgeon’s hand is closely applied over the eye not in question, the patient being placed opposite to a noiseless gas-burner, or other very bright.OrUTlIALMIG SURGERY. 462 light, but not so near that the heat of the flame is appreciable ; when questioned A’ery many times, the patient, if blind, cannot rightly tell the flame from the absence of it, when it is turned down so low that no actual light remains. The patients have had the power of A'ision, they may be habitually truthful, but they are glad to deceive themsehxs unconsciously (avc need not tell them so) ; they feel the warmth of the sun’s rays, or of the fire, and, knoAving what is the cause of this, they think that, as they used, they still perceive the accom- panying light: they hear the shutters shut and the lamp set on the table, and they picture to themselves the light, and even the objects lit up by it, in their ■accustomed positions. Or, they subjecUveltj see flashes of light Avhich are ■symptomatic of their complaint, and are analogous to the light we see in the dark with oiu’ eyes shut when the eyelids are violently rubbed. They say they can find their way about, but then it is m their own homes. They say they can count fingers, and then they hold up then- own to count. They are loth to belieA’e that they really see nothing at all, and therefore it is that in all cases it is necessary rigidly to cross-examine ex'ery patient in whose case we haA'C reason to suspect total blindness or the absence of any perception of light. A few questions will be only misleading, and every such case must be treated as if we suspected the patient of malingering, as it is called by army Sm-geons. The Operation is thus done. When the patient is under the influence of an amesthetic, a (spring) Avdre speculum is inserted between the lids to keep them open ; the conjunctiva is seized fluth toothed forceps, at any part near the margin of the cornea, and a small opening is made in it with rather blunt- pointed scissors. In the next place, the conjunctiva is to be divided all around the cornea. This may be done by inserting one blade of the scissors beneath the conjunctiva where it has been opened, and draAving the globe with the forceps one Avay or the other, as may be most convenient; or by seizing the conjunctiva with the forceps at the part to be next cut through, if it be too closely adherent to the subjacent parts to allow the passage of the point of the scissors. Or the strabismus-hook (Fig. 5G4, cl), inserted at the opening made in the conjunctiAm, may be carried round the cornea, and the conjunctiva, raised a little in this way, may be conveniently cut through if it be loose. When the circular incision of the mucous membrane is completed, the subcon- junctival tissues, seized at different parts in the wound, are cut through Avith the scissors, the points being dhected backwards and kept as closely as possible to the globe. An opening still deeper, close to the globe, in some part of the circumference of the womid, is made with the scissors, and then the strabismus- hook is passed beneath the tendon of one or other of the rectus muscles, which is divided, and so are then the other tendons in succession and other inter- A'enino- parts close to and connected Avith the globe. The tendons of the ^ oblique muscles being directed to the temporal side to be inserted, the hook must be directed towards and kept very close to the globe to secure them. But ■only the four rectus muscles are generally Avorth a sepm-ate seai-ch. All tlic •tendons being cut through, the divided ocular insertion of the internal rectus is seized with the forceps and the eye drawn outAvards ; a pair of scissors emwe on the flat (Fig. fiCI, e) is canied down beside the globe on the nasal side, as, -on this side, the optic nerve enters the globe and is most easily reached ; 1 scissors are opened a little and advanced, and the nerve is at one stroke dmdea.463 EXTIRPATION OF THE EYEBALL. The globe now generally comes forward suddenly. It is dra^m forward by holding it at the point of insertion of one of the rectus muscles or Avherever it may be secured conveniently, and any remaining adherent soft parts are divided, always of course as before, close to the globe. Dixon finds it con- venient to leave the insertion of the internal rectus muscle to bo at last divided after all the other muscles have been cut through, and the optic nerve also. Sometimes, if the globe be stapliylomatous or enlarged, so that after the division of the rectus tendons it is difficult to reach further back with two instruments within the comparatively small palpebral aperture, it is convenient then to remove the spring-speculum, and with the points of the fingers vdthin the two lids to force them backwards, so that the eye comes to stand out in fi'ont of the lids ; and this being done, the optic nerve may be easily reached with the scissors and divided, and the remaining soft parts dis- sected from tho globe. Or it may even be necessary to enlarge the palpebral aperture at the outer canthus, or to evacuate some of the fluid contents of the eye. After the four rectus tendons have been divided in this operation, the removal of the globe should be completed as quickly as may be, to prevent loss of blood, or its being extensively effused in the orbital and palpebral areolar tissue ; for, if the latter take place, it is so much the more difficult to reach the deeper surrounding parts to divide them, and the wound is longer in healing, and the lids of the patient are for so much the longer time discoloured after- wards. Hence we must stop the bleeding as soon as possible after the globe is effectual way is, perhaps, the speculum beino- still within the lids, or reintroduced, to have a basin of cold water broimbt and a sponge fiill of it held at some height, so that the water falls from it in a con- muous stream and with some force into the vacant orbital space, a We emiitr sponge being also placed against the temple of the side of the extirpation to receive the flow of water. It should be continued untd the oozing of blood fr-om between the hds has ceased.

In the centre sometimes is found a button-like projection of some of the soft parts left outside the mucous membrane in the healing of the scar, and constricted by it to a narrow neck in the centre behind the projection. It is easily snipped off with a pair of curved scissors. Less deformity or greater perfection in simulating the appearance and movements of a lost eye may be, no doubt, obtained by abscission ; but it is generally a short-sighted policy, and very often as dangerous in the end, though brilliant at the time, as was the old operation of couching for cataract. There is but one serious mishap after an excision-operation ; and that is, con- tinued bleeding from the deep-seated soft parts many hours after the operation. It arises from parts inaccessible from their being far back in the orbit, and so much the more so when the areolar tissue of the orbit and lids is distended with blood : these become so tense and prominent, and pressure is so difficult of application in the midst of so much infiltrated areolar .tissue and fat, even if one knew exactly whence the bleeding came, that it is difficult to overcome it when it occurs. It has never but once occiuTed to me since I have used the cold water as above described, and the sponge and tight bandage sub- sequently to this, after the operation. In a pre^dons case, very early in my practice, where perhaps in doing the operation I had not merely divided the parts close to the globe of the eye, I was called to the patient in the night after I had operated. The lids formed two enormous red protrusions, and a little stream of blood flowed continuously from between them : I tried the actual cautery ineffectually, and succeeded at last by thrusting long pointed rolls of bnen soaked in tincture of perchloride of iron, in different directions, into the spongy mass. It can never be Avorth while to do the operation of abscission in any case, otherwise faA'Ourable for the operation, unless the patient intend to wear a glass eye ; if he do not, the globe had certainly better be excised at once: and in such case, an operation has sometimes been done to create a permanent artificial ptosis, by removal of a part of the lex^ator palpebrm muscle near its insertion into the cartilage of the upper lid, by an incision through the skin, just below the upper edge of the orbit; the lid then falls, and the vacant space is always covered by it. If, instead of carefully preserving the conjunctiva, as in cases of excision of the eye in Avhich an artificial eye is to be worn, it be all removed, the lids will be evenly and permanently closed, and this I have done in some such cases. As to the old operation for extirpation of the globe, in Avhich a great part of all of the surrounding contents of the orbit were, with it, remOA*ed with a large knife, it is ncA'er necessary, and therefore it is never done by able Surgeons, except in cases in which a malignant or other growth has penetrated the coats 1 of the eye from Avithin, and extended more or less into the soft parts around. ' Then these parts must be Avidely cut array, when the globe is excised, Avith a j knife or scissors, as may be most conA’enient. ^ . , Ajbscission.—A fcAV years ago this operation was much more in use than it now is. It is applicable to cases in which there is no essential pain, m Avhich the disease, stagihyloma cornea, generally, is confined to the fr-ont of the globe, so that by this operation, at least probably and mainly, all the parts disease may be removed.465 STAPHYLOMA. Staphyloma is a term appliocl to any bulging of a part of the coats of the eyeball, primarily of the sclerotic or cornea, or of any tissues replacing these proper coats. Staphyloma cornem generally begins at a part at which there is by imperfeet tissues that give way, , A selorotic staphyloma will involve the other coats within it, which also become expanded and thinned. A corneal staphyloma frequently candes vuth it the iris, whieh had become adherent to the posterior surface of the cornea, when the disease, the first cause of the staijhyloma, brought them into contact, and thus it is expanded over the bulged cornea behind it. A corneal staphy- loma generally has a central white patch, ill defined in the comparatively clear tissues around it, the leucoma marking the old disease in which it had begun. A small partial corneal staphyloma, in a seeing eye, may be, if sufficiently well defined, simply removed vdth a knife, leaving the remaining clear cornea, in the hope that it vill firmly cicatrise, and not again bulge, and afford still useful vision ; but such a case is not often met Avith, nor is the hope then often ful- filled. If an eye vdth total but inconsiderable staphyloma cornete retain some vision, one can only do abscission or excision, if the patient decidedly vush it; then it may be done because it will only go on from bad to worse, and at u fritm-e time the operation will be inevitable. But in a case of extreme cor- neal staphyloma, the eye, very probably, still retains perception of light ; and ■of this, unless it be all the patient sees, the other eye being lost, no account must be taken, and the operation must be recommended. Pain alone does not contra-indicate the operation of abscission, but it must be apparenfry such as is due only to the disease of the anterior parts of the eye, to the irregidar surface and prominence of the quasi-corneal tissue, some- times even exposed for some time to the air, and drying, as the lids can’hardlv close OA’cr it. ^ The object of the operation is to remove, an useless and painful or un- sightly feafrire, and to gain, instead of it, a low stump as a good foundation tor an artificial eye. If we are. careful to remoA'e the lens, which is liable to Chalky and other degenerations, and the ciliary body, which is full of muscular tissue, nerves, and blood-vessels, together with the offending parts, we get rid nfk chances of irritation the other*e^^ sympathetic irritation and inflammation in is “■ c^sion, one or the other, In thc^rises of*m undoubtedly advisable, tivelv «r„,1 “‘“Phyloma corneas, the deeper parts are only comp.ii-a- mde irthoo 'T’ ' ='l>«ission,L s unn, “ounded and shr n? “'<= "«cidLtally cases occur.

If if; 'were not so, the excision operation -would bo more generally adopted in cases of disease of the front only of the eye. The stump of an eye left, if it can he made useful, is a much better foundation for an artificial eye to ho -worn upon, than is the cushion only of the soft parts left far back in the orbit by excision ; and the ocular muscles haye a definite j insertion and action. The healing of an abscissed globe is tedious, and per- haps painful; whereas there is no trouble or anxiety whatever about the heal- ing after the excision of an eye. But few comparatively of our hospiial patients ■will or can have the opportunity in future years of continuing to pro-ride themselves Avith an artificial eye, every year or two, wdien a new one is required. Aud it is absm’d to do an abscission in any case unless the patient intended to wear a glass eye ; he had much better have the offending globe removed at once and altogether, if for that reason only. In private practice we can better depend on our patients not neglecting any symptoms against Avhich they arc Avarned ; and, of course, the stump of an abscissed globe can be excised at any time if it began to be painful or tender. Operation.—An incision, oval horizontally, through the sclerotic and other coats of the eye, is made to enclose the cornea, ciliary body, and lens, all of which are removed together. Sutures may or may not be used to drair the sides of the gap together, from above and below, to retain better the vitreous body, to hasten the time of healing, and leave a better shaped stump and smaller scar. But the sutures sometimes give much pain, and keep up inflammatory symp- toms during the protracted healing. Supposing they are employed, three or four stout and semicircular curved needles, each with a silver-wire or black silk thread, are inserted in a row above the cornea, at about half an inch from the comeal margin. These are respectively carried at some distance behind the ciliary body and lens, and brought out below the cornea at about as far fr’om the corneal margin as they were when introduced. Then a punctm-e is made with a pointed knife through the coats of the eye at about half an inch external to the margin of the cornea, and by it one blade of a bhmt-pointed scissors is introduced, and so an oval piece of sclerotic, including the cornea, &c., is removed altogethei’, and just within the points at AAfrich, above and below, the needles traverse the sclerotic. Then the needles are dra-wn through, and the sutures are tied in knots each to each. THE OPHTHALMOSCOPE. The advantages of the ophthalmoscope, in a surgical point of view, and as an aid in the treatment of eye-diseases generally, have been alluded to (p. 418, | ct seq.). Fig. 573 represents the way in which I recommend the instrument to be used. The patient rests and steadies his head against a high upright-backed chair. (Ophthalmic Hospital Reports, vol. III. p. G4), and the observer, standing.before him, can easily move his head, not only from side to side, as Avhen he is seated in the way usually recommended, but he can as easily look irom above or below • and this is more convenient, as he can more easily command his own movements than those of the patient’s eyes. The best common ophthalmoscope is Liebreich’s. It has a small, polished, slightly concave metal mirror, reflect-THE OPIITIIALMOSGOPE. 467 i„„ c..on-li ligM, tat o' ooni-so, than a silvared glass mm-or, winch m^e- ^vo. is nsnally made larger.

This clip is hinged, so that the lens contained by it can be turned aside when it is not required to be used. The mirror is held, as in the figure, to the right eye, to examine the right eye of the patient, and vice versd, with the handle horizontal, the little finger extended for the patient to look at, which if he does, then the observer (unless also the eye that is being examined be squinting) has in view the optic nerve-entrance in the fundus of the eye. And this is the best starting point, although the rest of the deeper parts of the eye remain to be examined. It is best to begin the use of the ophthalmoscope in the normal eye (the pupil dilated wth atropine) of a young person of fair com- plexion. First, a reddish glare is seen, and this is lighter at the optic nerve- entrance. Then, in order to perceive the details of the fundus, the lens, held in the free hand of the observer, is brought before the eye that is examined at a distance of a few inches, and moved all wjiys in the line of the reflected light of the fundus, until the best image is obtained. This hand may be steadied against the forehead of the patient. This mode of ophthalmoscopic examina- tion is the “ indirect” (inverted image). It is that usually employed. Some practice with the ophthalmoscope is necessary before proceeding to examine H H 2OPHTHALMIC SURGERY. 468 the deep-seated morbid appearances within the eye. Tlie preliminary use of atropine should bo dispensed witli as soon as possible in learning the use of the ophthalmoscope, and always afterwards, when the diagnosis without it is not made incomplete. Or at least it may be employed in weak solution, for one eye only (that of which the patient is independent—the worst eye—the least useful), and the patient forewarned of its temporary effects. Waiting for the pupil to become dilated expends time, and if atropine be indiscriminately used the increasing mischief, in some cases of nerve-blindness, &c., will be often ascribed to it. And for ophthalmoscopic diagnosis, it is only absolutely required in some obscure cases of commencing cataract or of vitreous and other opacities in the fundus oculi, &c. With the ophthalmoscope, a lens or cataract dislocated by a blow into the vitreous chamber, and lying quietly at the bottom of that space, or gTa^sitating perhaps to either side, may often be detected. Operation follows, of course, in this case the diagnosis afforded by the ophthalmoscope, which without it certainly would be impossible: an attempt at least must be made to remove the lens “couched” thus accidentally, in anticipation of the irritation and inflam- mation that it AviU set up. Dixon (Ojphthalmic HospilalRejJorts, 'S'ol. I. pp. 280-5) reports a case in which he discovered by the use of the ophthalmoscope, in the ordinary way, a foreign body (a chip of metal) entangled in some remains of blood-clot hanging in the vitreous chamber. Thus aided, and having per- fectly satisfied himself of the exact position of the foreign body, he made an opening through the sclerotic at a point opposite to that at which it was sus- pended, and succeeded in removing it with forceps. Also it is indispensable, previously, in desperate operations for evacuating the fiuid of detached retina. Bader uses it, indeed, whilst he is actually operating. That is to say, he passes a long needle in through the sclerotic, &c., at a point opposite to the most prominent part of the detached retina, and, looking thi’ough the ophthal- moscope, he makes the needle enter this prominence ; then he gives to an assistant the ophthalmoscope, to direct the light into the eye ; he then passes a second similar needle, also through the sclei’otic, at a third of an inch fi'om the first, and, not passing it further in than the first, he directs it to the same spot, so that it may also enter the detached retina ; and he makes them touch. Finally, by approximating the handles, without any other change of position of the two needles, he makes the rent in the retina. To be sure that this is done, he withdraws now the second needle, and examines the fundus again | with the ophthalmoscope himself, to see if the subretinal fiuid has entered the | vdtreous chamber, to see the rent if possible, or some evidence of the success of j the operation. If there be none, he re-introduces the second needle, to repeat j the operation. ^DISEASES OF THE GUMS AND ALVEOLAR PROCESSES. 469 CHAPTER LVII. DISEASES OF THE JAWS AND THEIE APPENDAGES. DISEASES OP THE GUMS AND ALVEOLAR PROCESSES. Abscess of the Gums is of veiy frequent occiuTence, from the irritation of decayed teeth. Here a free and early incision should be made ; which, by giving exit to the pus, wiU afford immediate relief. Spongy and Sloughy Ulceration of the Gums wiU occiu’ as the result of constitutional cachexy induced in any way—by mercury, malaria, syphilis, &c. It is best treated by tonics, in conjunction with the chlorate of potass and mineral acids internally. If it spread actively, escharotics, such as hydi’o- chloric acid or creasote, may be advantageously applied. If it do not make much progTess, a solution of nitrate of silver, uith chlorinated or tannin gargles, will be useful. Simple Hypertrophy of the Gums, in the fonn of a pendulous fr’inged outgTOwth overlapiring the teeth in back and front, is occasionally met with in yoimg children. Such a growth requires to be freely removed with scalpel or scissors. In a case of this kind under my care, it was found to consist of the ordinary structure of the gums, with a fine fibrous stroma con- taining much gland-tissue; the papilljB on ,'the surface were very large, and covered by unusually thick epithe- lium. Epulis is a tmnour springing fr-om the perios- teum and edge of the alveolus, and implicating the osseous walls ; it grows up between and loosens the neighbouring tooth, which of upper jaw, Uuwu so as to overlap the . . it displaces and cm-elopos Evulh kinds; s'iWju/e and malignant.

It appears chiefly to be occasioned by the iratation of decayed stumps, and hence occurs more frequently in connection Avith the molar than with the incisor teeth. Although this disease has occasionally been seen in children, it seldom occurs before the adult age, and then may be developed at any—even up to an advanced—period'of hfe. It is seen then I as often among females as males. A fibrous epulis appears as a red, smooth, and lobulated timiour, at first hard and semi-elastic, like the ordinary structm'e of the gum, but after a time softening by disintegration, and ulcerating on the surface, with a pinmlent or sanious dischai’ge. The fibrous variety appears simply to be a circumscribed and rapidly growing hypertrophy of the gum. Treatment.—The treatment of epulis consists in the removal of the Avhole of the mass and of that portion of the alveolus from which it springs. As it evinces a great tendency to reproduction, it must not simply be shaved off the bones, but a portion of the osseous structure must be removed as well; unless this be done, the growth Avill to a certainty be reproduced. In all ordinary cases of simple epulis, the remoA’al may be done fr’oni the inside of the mouth Avithout the necessity of making any incisions through the cheek. In very large masses of epulis, more particularly of the myeloid variety, and extending towards the ramus, it may be necessary either to carry an incision from the angle of the mouth doAvnwards and outwards, or to dissect up the cheek from the bone, and thus expose the disease fully. In perform- ing the operation, the first thing to be done is to extract a tooth on each side of the timioiu'; a cut must then be made with a saAV through the alveoli of the teeth that haA^e been removed, down to a level AAith the base of the growth. In doing this, care must be taken not to cut too near the remaining teeth, lest the ahnoli be opened and their support lost. If the tumour be large, it may be necessary to saw deeply; but the base of the lower jaAv should, AA'henever practicable, be left intact, the whole of its snb- stance not being sawn through, so that, though a considerable portion of bone be remoA’ed, yet the length of the jaw may be preserved. For this pm’pose Hey’s saw should not be used, as it is a niggling instrument, difficult to manage in this situation ; but a straight and stiff-backed saAV, with as deep a blade as the mouth AA'ill coiiA'eniently admit, AAdll be found most useful (Fig. 415). The epulis, included between two vertical cuts, may now, if small, be removed with cross-cutting forceps, and the bleeding stopped by placing a plug in the Avound and comj)ressing it against the teeth of the upper jaw by means of a bandage passed under the chin. If the epuhs be large, a horizontal cut shoidd be made along the bone about midAA'ay betAAnen the alveolus and the base, by means of Key’s saw; and, after the bone has been penetrated to a sufficient depth, the blade of the cross-cutting forceps may be fixed^ in this cut, and the diseased part then removed. Should there be a spouting dental artery, it may be necessary to apply a red-hot wire, or the perchloridc i of iron, in order to arrest its bleeding. The cut surface will speedily granu- late ; and the cavity fills up Avith fibrous tissue. The operation for the removal of epulis is a very safe one. Of 28 cases collected by Hutchinson from different London Hospitals, only one aaus fatal, from pya3mia. Malignant Epulis.—Cancerous ulcers and fungus sarcomatous gTOAvths Irom the alveolar processes, malignant epuhs, as they arc called, occui in tlie sameFUOSrHORUS-NECROSIS OF THE JAW. 471 Avay as the last; but they are soft, purplish, very ^■ascular, grow rapidly, and are speedily reproduced after remo^-al: they principally, so far as my obser- vation goes, occur in males advanced in life. These tumours require the same operation as the simple epulis ; and, as much htemorrhage usually follows their removal, a red-hot iron must be applied to the bleeding surface. If a malignant epulis be very large, it may be necessary to remove a portion of the whole thickness of the bone, through an external incision, as will be described in the section on Excision of the Lower Jaw (p. 48G). necrosis of the Jaw is commonly the effect of blows, of salivation by mer- cury, of syphilis, of fever, or of exposure to the fumes of phosphorus. I ha^^e, however, seen the disease occur idiopathically in otherwise healthy subjects, without any assignable cause. In this way I have seen the whole of the alveolar process of the upper jaw exfoliate in a young lady, otherwise perfectly healthy ; and I have several times had occasion to remove large portions of the lower jaw—in one case more than half of the bone—for necrosis that could not be refeiTed to any of the causes mentioned above, or indeed to any assignable reason. The disease begins with deeply seated pain resembling inveterate tooth- ache, which nothing will allay; the gums become swollen ; the teeth ai’e loosened, and eventually di’op out. Before they do so, however, pus usually wells up thi’ough the alveoh. Abscesses form inside the mouth and under the angles of the jaw, having fistulous openings thi-ough Avhich bare bone is reached by the probe. The general health suffers greatly, more so than in necrosis generally, doubtless in consequence of the patient swallowing some of the pus from the dead bone. Aecrosis of the jaws, arising from the inhalations of the fumes of phosphorus during the manufacture of lucifer matches, fii-st noticed by Lorinser of Vienna has been especially described by Yon Bibra and Geist, who had abundant opportimities of observing the disease at the large maniffactories at Mu’emberg. This Lucifer match disease was some years ago very frequent, but, in con- sequence of the adoption of precautionary measiues, is now much more rarely met vith. It consists in necrosis of the jaws, and is attended by the symptoms above described, but in a more severe degvee and an acute form. The affected bone midergoes a remarkable change, assuming the porous aspect and gi-ey colom- of dirty pumice stone. Both jaws are equally liable to be affected ; but commonly one only at a time is diseased, and the whole of the bone may die and be separated. Thus of ol cases observed by Von Bibra, both ja\vs were affected m five instauces only—the upper alone in 21 cases, the lower'in 25. According to Jiangcnbcck, the local disease is preceded in many instances by general symp'"- toms ot phosphorus-poisoning ; and there is a considerable amount of bony deposit from periostitis, which encloses the necrosed bone. It has been believed tnat orkmen having sound teeth are not easily if at all influenced by the fumes Ptiosphorus acts through carious teeth: but Laugenbeck has bscned that the teeth have been sound in cases of the disease. Tho vT treatment of necrosis of the jaws presents nothing special T c_removal of the sequestra should be effected as far as practicable throuo-h the mtenor of the mouth, by free incisions through the gums. n the jaw, where the necrosis seldom extends beyond the alveolar border or the palatal process, this may always readily be done472 DISEASES OF THE JAWS AND THEIR APPENDAGES. Ill tlic loiuer jaw, tlio question as to whether the dead hone should be ex- tracted thi-ough the inside of the mouth, or by incision from without through the cheek, will be determined partly by the position of the sinuses and partly by the situation and extent of the bone affected. This may in a great measure lie ascertained by the situation of the sinuses leading down to it. If these be ill the cheek, or in the side of the neck, or under the angle of the jaw, it is usually an indication that, if the whole of the corresponding ramus or body of the bone be not involved, the posterior and outer parts are certainly affected ; and, in these circumstances, extraction of the sequestrum is best effected by opening up the sinuses parallel to the line of the jaw, and removing the necrosed bone in the usual way. The incisions for this purpose need not usually be very extensive. If the operation be delayed, m accordance with those principles that guide us in the management of necrosed bone generally, until the seques- trum is quite loose, it may usually be readily extracted, in whole or in pieces, through an opening that wiU leave but a small cicatrix. By such operations as these, the whole of the lower jaw has been extracted piecemeal at intervals in a state of necrosis, first on one and then on the other side. Carnochan has removed the whole of the necrosed lower jaw at one operation, disarticulating first one and then the other condyle in the usual way. If, however, there be no external abscess or sinus—if the gum have been loosened and perforated, with a ragged portion of sequestrum j)rojecting through it into the cavity of the mouth, then no external incisions will be required, but the dead bone may be readily removed from within the mouth. Lai’ge portions of the jaw may thus be removed. I have taken away the whole of the ramus with its processes, entirely through the gums, without any external incision : and, in a negro, the whole of the bone in a state of necrosis has thus been removed in separate pieces, by Perry, tkrough the inside of the mouth. Rrprocluci'WJi of the Jaw after Removal.—The amount of regeneration of bone wiU depend greatly upon the state of the periosteum before the removal of the sequestra. If tins be healthy, and if new bone have ah’eady formed prior to operation, a veiy perfect reproduction of the portions of jaw removed may take place; in fact, complete repro- duction of the whole of the lower jaw, body, rami, and epiphyses, though in a somewhat rudimen- tary and imperfect form, may follow its removal for phosphoriis- necrosis. In the musemn of the BellcAUie Hospital, New York, Wood showed me two specimens, one of the necrosed lower jaw, removed by him for phosphorus- disease from a girl aborrt 10 (Vig. 07.1). Ste died of taaiin-dis^so three after operation! mrd in the same collection is her cranmm iv.th a lepiodueed Fi". 57G.—Wood's Case of Phosiiliorus-Nccrosis of ciitiro ° Lower Jaw.47S CYSTIC DISEASE OF THE ANTRUAI. lower jaw, consisting of an entire semicircle of bone, about 5-8ths of an inch broad, with all the epiphyses. This unique and most interesting case has already been described, and the regenerated bone figured (p. 182, Fig. 413). In it the periosteum must have been presciwed entire, and thus led to the repro- duction of the bone. Should no new bone have formed before the operation, a dense fibroid cicatricial structure will replace the removed bone. DISEASES OP THE ANTRUM AND UPPER JAW. Oiu- present knowledge of the operative procedures necessary for the removal of diseases of the jaws, is chiefly due to the labours of Gensoul, of Lizars, ancL of Liston. Sir W. Fergnsson has greatly distinguished himself in this field of surgery, and has simplified and extended it much in its operative department aiuf C. Heath has made important contributions to its literature. O’Shatigh- nessy also, who has had many opportiuiities of witnessing these affections- amongst the natives of India, has added much to our acquaintance with their pathology and treatment. The vai’ious large and irregular cavities that lie amongst the bones of the- face may become the seat of disease, primarily originating either in the mucous- membrane by which they are fined, or in the osseous structures that compose their walls. In this way the frontal smuses, the ethmoidal and sphenoidal coUs, and the antnim, may either be seats of chronic inflammation of theh” mucous finings, -with more or less profuse muco-purulent discharge ; or the mucous membrane may take on more serious orgam'c disease. Thus epithelio- matous, fibroid, fibro-plastic, myeloid, or cancerous tumours may develop fr’om it, and, after distending the cavity in which they were originally formed, may thin and destroy its osseous walls; and, thus passing outwards into other- situations about the face and the base of the skuU, where they are freed from the pressure of sun’ounding bone, they may take upon themselves greatly in- creased development, blocking up mucous canals, as the nose and the lacrymal sac and ducts, displacing the eye, and producing great disfigiu’ement of the side of the face. These secondary developments, from the rapidity of their um-e- strained growth, and the amount of deformity and distress which they occasion,, may readily be mistaken for the primary disease, the real starting point of which will often be found in a deeper and more limited locality. That the bones con- stituting the walls of these facial cavities may also become the original seats of morbid deposits, more particularly of the enchondromatous, myeloid, and ence- phaloid kinds, there can be little doubt. These deposits run a similar coiu’se to those originating irr the mucous membranes. Dropsy and. Cystic Disease of the Antrum, from accumulation or rather development 'within this cavity of glairy mucus, like the corrterits of a ranula or ganglion, or of a thirr browrrish serous fluid containirrg cholesterirre, occasionally occur. But in most instarrccs the accumulatiorr of fluid is serous, and not mucoid, and the disease is evidently a true cystic development, uith an acth e growth independent of distention. In some cases, distention of the- antrurn appears to be simply the result of the accumulatiorr of its natiu’al secretion ; for, as the aperture leading from this carfity into the nose is a little abo-v e rts floor, there may be a natural tenderrey for the fluid secreted here to accumulate to some extent before it is discharged ; and if this aperture be474 diseases OF THE JAWS AWE THEIR ARPENDAGES.

In such cares the accumulation of fluid may after a time expand and absorb the osseous walls of tile ca^nty, so as to constitute a true cystic disease ; and in this way the cheek is rendered round and prominent—an indolent semi-elastic tumour forming in it and protruding it outwards, and giving rise to the egg-shell or parchment-like crackling on prcssm’e (Fig. 577). The floor of the orbit or the roof of the mouth may be caused to bulge, and the nasal cavity may be encroached upon. According to C. Heath, we find that Denti- gerous Cysts may occiu- in either jaw. They arise in connection with teeth which from some cause have been retained in the jaw. They are almost invariably connected with the permanent teeth. Tomes believes that they arise from the excessive formation around a retained tooth of a fluid which is normally found after the com- plete development of the enamel, between it and the soft tissues investing it. The tooth is not unfrequently fomid to be inverted. The cysts may occim at any age, but are most common in young adults. In the upper jaw they may form cysts in the antrum. In the lower jaw, they form prominent isolated tmnoiu-s. They have been mistaken for sohd tmnoiu’s, and the jaw has in consequence been partially removed. Occasionally they may suppm-ate. Heath also men- tions dentinal tumours, i.e. irregular masses of dentine growing from a tooth and forming tumours of the jaw ; but they seem very rare. Treatment.—When the accumulation of fluid is small, vflth moderate expan- sion of the superior maxilla, catheterism of the antrum may be practised by passing a cmwed probe along the side of the nostril between the superior and middle turbinate bones ; where, in the middle meatus, about its centre, the ■aperture leading into the sinus may be felt. Should this treatnient not suc- ceed, or should the anterior ivaU be much expanded, the antrum must be opened from 'without : this is done without incising the lips or wounding the face, by thrusting a trochar and cannula into the most thimied and expanded part of the tumour under the cheek ; or, if necessary, by dissecting up the cheek from the gum, and thus making an opening into the ca-vity of the antrum with a strong pair of scissors or a perforator, through its most expanded and thinnest part, so as to allow the dischai'ge to escape fr-ecly. In order to prevent a re-accumulation of the fluid, it will be better to cut away a small portion of the thinned and expanded wall of the antrum, and thus to establish a permanent apertme iu it. The shape of the cheek may be restored by the gradual pressure of a spring pad or double-headed roller. Suppuration may take place in the antrum. It is usually excited by the irritation of a carious molar tooth, or by some injury of the face, and may occasion much throbbing or lancinating pain. The jms, as it foi’ms, ill .sometimes overflow, as it were, into the nose through the aperture into475 SUPFURATIOX JiY THE ANTRUM. the middle fossa, and then may keep up constant iiTitation, with much fetor in the nostrils ; in other cases, it drains thi’ough the socket of a tooth into the mouth ; and in other instances again, its exit being prevented, it gives rise to enlargement of the cheek, the soft parts of which become brawny and inflamed, and the bones expanded, so that at last they are thinned to such an extent that, as in dropsy of the cavity, they crackle when pressed upon. Any portion of the wall of the cavity—the orbital, buccal, palatal, or nasal—may thus be expanded and fluctuation be felt through it; and, the lacrymal duct being connnonly obstructed, the eye on the affected side becomes Avatery. Treatment.—The treatment of this condition consists in the extraction of any carious toOth seated in the neighbourhood of the antrum ; or, if the teeth be all sound, in the removal of the second molar, the fangs of which 5°’ perforate the bottom of, the carity. tl f suffliotlt fi 'Ji^targe hrlh thTca^^^^^ tl.o antmm must be opened through the alreolns, °or Sata s ' tl^^T expanded in the antrum m-iw reached.

Tumours of various kinds spring from the upper jaw, taking their origin either from the surface of the superior maxillary or malar bones, from the interior of the antrum, or from the pterygo-maxillary fossa. Those that gi’ow from the Surfaca of the Bone, are either some of the various forms of Epulis that spring from its alveolar border, and must be treated as already described ; or they are Exostoses growing from the outer smface of the bone, pi’ojecting perhaps ujd into the orbit, and requiring removal Avith the saw, bone-nij)pers, or gouge. In doing this, care must be taken not to destroy the nasal process of the bone, lest the lacrymal sac be opened. The tumours that spring from the Malar Bone, from the Cavity of the Antrum, or from Behind the U'pyyer Jaio, are of very A'arious kinds ; epithelio- matous, fibrous, cartilaginous, osseous, fatty, sarcomatous, erectile, and ence- phaloid growths may all be met with in this situation. In the Musemn of Unh'ersity College, which is very rich in specimens of these tumours, most of the.above-named Anrieties will be found. The Eibroris Tumour is perhaps the most common; it principally occurs in elderly people, and may attain veiy considerable bulk. The large and small spindle celled sarcomata come next in order of frequency ; and the Osseous, Encliondromatous, Epithelial, and Myeloid are extremely rare. The osseous tumours occasionally appear to set up a spontaneous attempt at elimination, by necrosis taking place in them. Situation and Symjptoms.-—Epithelial, sarcomatous, and myeloid tumoms occasionally spring from the surface of the malar bone, pushing forAvard the cheek, spreading into the mouth, and involving, Avith gveater or less rapidity, according to their mahgnancy, the soft structures of the face and the lympha- tic glands under the jaw. They are usually rapid in groAvth, soft and elastic to the feel, irregular in outline, and only secondarily implicate the superior maxilla and neighbouring caA’ities. The various growths that are connected with, or spring from, the mucous onembrane, or that develop Avithin the antrum, in growing, gradually expand and dilate the walls of the cavity, pressing the bones outAvards thinning them, and giving rise to a considerable outward projection of one side of the face, the anterior surface of the superior maxilla being the part that usually first yields to the outward pressme. The tumour thus formed is generally smooth, round, or oval, slightly lobed perhaps, more especially if fibrous, and has in many cases a tendency to hang doAvnwards so as to overlap the lower jaw to a certain extent. As it grows, it encroaches more or less upon the structures lying in the vicinity of the antrum. Thus, it pushes doAAUi the palate, causing considerable swelling in the roof of the mouth ; displaces the alveolar processes and teeth, giving rise to irregularity in their outline, and tending to project into and occupy the ah'eolus. It may encroach upon the orbit, occasioning stiUicidium lacrjTuarum, impairment of vision, and displace- ment of the eye-ball. As the tumour enlarges, it obstructs the nasal cavity, and, stretching back into the pharynx, interferes Avith I’cspiration, and degluti- tion, and sometimes occasions severe epistaxis. When it is of a malignant character, obstruction of the nasal fossa Avill be found to be one of its earliest signs, leading to the suspicion of nasal polypus; but the true and more serious477 DIAGNOSIS OF TUMOURS OF UPPER JAW. nature of the disease -will be re^’caled by the integuments becoming involyed, the gums implicated, and perhaps the submaxillary absorbent glands enlarged. Diafjnosis.—In the diagnosis of these tumoiu’S groAving in the upper jaAA’, there are three principal points to be attended to :—1, to distinguish the groAvth from fluid accumulation ; 2, to determine AA'^hether the growth be simple or malignant ; and, 3, to ascertain its primary seat. 1. In making the diagnosis from fluid accumulaiion in the antrum, the history of the case, and the uniform enlargement of the caAity Avithout the tumoiu’ projecting externally beyond any part of its walls, the elasticity and even fluctuation that may, after a time, be detected, more particularly toAvards the outer side of the tumour, and at the junction of the mucous membrane of the cheek and the gum, will enable the Sm-geon to determine that it is not solid. But in many cases that is not sufficient; and it becomes necessary to make an exploratory puncture by means of the perforator, through one or other of the more thinned and expanded parts already indicated. This should never be omitted in cases of doubt; for it has happened even to so good a Siu’geon as <rensoul that, after making incisions through the cheek with the view of ex- tirpating the tumour, the bones were found to be expanded by an antral abscess, mid that, consequently, the operation had been undertaken unnecessarily. 2. In determining whether the growth be simple or malignant, the Sm-geon An'll experience much difficulty, so long as it is confined to the cavity of the antrum ,• but when once it has perforated and passed beyond its Avails, this point is easily solved. Yet, even whilst the tumour is still confined AAithin the antrum, much light may be thrown upon its natm-e by attention to the rapidity of its growth ; the greater this is, the more reason there is to suspect that it IS malignant. Too much importance, however, must not be attached to this sign; for though, as a general rule, fibrous and cartilaginous tumours may increase less rapidly than the malignant, yet they may attain a A'ery great nilk in a short space of time. The age of the patient is of comparatively little value in the diagnosis ; I think, however, that, as a general rule, simple umoms nmst frequently occur in the young, whilst the malignant forms of tue affection are commonly met with at the middle or advanced periods of importance, in a diagnostic point of view, to examine the Xn r . is malignant, they mv ThT indurated at a very early period. In a case under defri^nLrV 1 character of a tumour, whilst still in the antrum, was "lands Ivino-1 i ° ^ indurated lymphatic arily affected ^ become second- ^owth It 1 fi^^o^Ttion, before the bones had been perforated by the run nnJLuZ u' many of the sarcomata Avhich rin" in internal ^ mfiltrating suiTounding parts and reciir- onc'p a TnnT ' s-ffect the lymphatic glands.

When it springs from the mterior of the antrum, the buccal, orbital, nasal, or palatal Avails of that caAdty are ex- panded, and the line of teeth is rendered irregular. When the tumour primarily springs from the malar lone (Fig. 581), ifc pushes foi’Avard the cheek into a somewhat conical prominence, and dips donm into the mouth between the gums and the soft struc- tures of the face. It does not involve the orbit or palate, or alter the line of the teeth ; but rather spreads over the bones, and in- volves the covering soft parts by continuity of tissue, AAdthoufc any definite anatomical disposition. As the tumour increases in size, it will implicate the anterior wall of the antrum, and thus secondarily projects into that cavity. When the disease developes primarily lehind the siqoerior maxilla, between it and the great ala or the pterygoid process of the sphenoid, the upper jaw-bone is simply pushed bodily forwards, there being little if any defoiniity in its outline, the line of teeth not being displaced, nor the AvaUs of the antrum— palatal, nasal, or orbital—expanded. Yet ifc must be borne in mind that the difficulty of diagnosis is greatly increased by the fact that a tmnour, though not originating in the antriun, may pass into the orbit through the spheno- maxillaiy fissure, and may make its way forwards amongst the bones of the face, partly by creeping through, and partly by absorbing and displacing them. Treatment.—In the treatment of tumour of the upper jaw and antrirm, nothing can be done except to extirpate the growth ; and it is consequently of great importance to distinguish those forms of the disease in Avhich an opera- tion can be undertaken with safety, and with a fair chance of success, fi’oni those in which none should be performed. The three points to be considered are ; 1, whether the tumour is benign ; 2, if ifc be benign, AV'hefcher ifc grows from the antrum or springs from behind the superior maxiUa ; or 3, Avhether ifc is malignant; and if so, whether ifc has passed the boundaries of the antrum. When the tumour, springing from the antrum, is of a simple character, the disease should bo removed, together with the whole of the superior maxilla ,- the tumour, Avhatever size ifc has attained, being generally encysted, and the bones expanded and absorbed aroimd it; so that ifc is w'ell bounded, and does not implicate neighbouring parts. Here, as Liston justly observes,.no nibbling or grubbing operations should be done, but free excision of the wdiole 581.—Malignant Disease of Malar Bone not suitable for operation.479 OPERATIONS ON THE UPPER JAW. mass practised. When the tumour springs from the spheno-maxillary or pterygo-maxillary fossa, pusliing the bones of the side of the face for\vards, an operation should not be lightly undertaken, as it is doubtful, in many cases, ■whether the Surgeon can interfere ■with any prospect of success. Should, ho\v- cver, the tumour bo simple, the patient’s health bo good, and an operation be deemed expedient, the tumour can only be reached by excising the upper ja^', ■when it may either be removed attached to that bone, or it may be extirpated from the cavity in ■which it lies behind it, and the bone and cheek shut in OA’cr it. Such an operation, implicating as it does the base of the skull, may be followed by death from shock to the nervous centres, as I saw happen in a patient of Liston’s thus operated upon ; or, involving the internal maxillary artery, may be attended by very profuse and troublesome hmmon'hage. When once a malignant gi'owth of this part has passed beyond the osseous boimdaries of the antrum, the question of removal becomes very complicated. In refer- ence to this point, I think that it may be stated generally that, if the cheek be freely movable over the tumour, and the submaxillary glands unaffected, the operation may be proceeded Avith. But, if it have advanced so far as to impheate the soft stnictures of the cheek, A\ith enlargement of the submaxiUary glands, it is neither wise nor prudent to interfere Avith it by opera- tion ; as infiltration aaIII have taken place more widely than the knife can reach, and speedy reciUTence must of necessity ensue. So long as it is contained AA'ithin this cavity, AA'here indeed it is often impossible to ascer- tain, until after removal, the true nature of the affection, it may be excised, provided the glands in the neck be not greatly enlarged.

Liston, whoso experience in these diseases was in his day ■unrivalled, strongly denounced all “grubbing” operations ; andSymestrongly <lisappro^’ed of the practice. But other Surgeons, Avhose views on the subject •ure entitled to the highest respect, advocate and practise this proceeding. For my own part, I look upon the practice as nnscientific in principle and dis- Fig. 5S3.—Saw with Movable Back, for Operations on the Upper Jaw. astrous in its results. It is only applicable to the softer kinds of tumours: and these are chiefly myeloid or sarcomatous. Now I hold it to be impossible by gouging, scooping, chiselling, or scraping, to extirpate these from any bone in •which they may be developed. It is impossible in this way faudy to go beyond the’limits of the disease into healthy structiu’es. Tissues that appear and feel •sound, are in reality infiltrated : and hence speedy recun-ence takes place. This has happened in every case in which I have seen this operation practised ; and the reciuTent is worse in all its features—more rapid, more luxiuiant, more malignant—than the primary disease. In fact, there is no reason why, in operations on the jaws, we should depart from that principle which is found necessary in operations on other parts for the removal of malignant growths, of being guided in the extent of the removal by the anatomical boimdaries of ithe part afiected, and not by the apparent extent of diseased structme. It seems to me to be as reasonable to scoop a myeloid or a malignant tumom out of the head of the tibia instead of amputating the affected bone, as it is to ■scrape it out of the antrum, instead of extirpating the superior maxilla. 2. Partial Excision of the Superior Maxilla.—Although I do not ■consider the scoopmg away of the tumour from the antrum to be a proper oi surgical procedure, I would not advocate the removal of more of the bones of the face than is absolutely necessary for the complete extirpation of the disease, more especially when that is not malignant. The disease may be limited either to the upper or to the lower part of the superior maxilla. In these cases, the practice of Sir W. Fergusson had led to great advances in our method of re- moving such disease with the ’least possible disfigiuement and the least loss of ■bone. With regard to the external incisions in these cases, Fergusson has sho-wn that they often need to be but very limited ; all that is necessaiy being •a cut fr-om the angle of the mouth upwards and outwards through the cheek, or, in other cases, a slit through the upper lip on the mesial line, the knife Being can-ied along the side of the base of the columna in the no^rils. Jiy ihesc simple incisions, this distinguished Surgeon has shown, suflicient re-COMPLETE EXCISION OF THE UPPER JAW. 481 laxation of parts can be obtained for the excision of the greater part of the b„nc and floor of the orbit will bo found to be sound. When this happens, they should both be loft; and with this the cheek has been incised as jnst described, a deep horizontal groove should b“^h a narrow straight-backed saw ^-/ow the orbit dunetly acr^^^^ from the nasal process of the maxillary to the edge of the malar bone. Ti e forceps should now bo applied so as to cut downwards and outwards from the end of this incision, and thus to sever the outer connexion between the super ioi maxilla and the malar bone. They are then to cut along the groove that has been traced horizontally with the saw, one blade cutting from the nares along this ; and lastly, the alveolus and hard palate have to be divided. This is best done after the extraction of one of the central incisors, by passing a narrow-bladed saw into the anterior nares and cutting down through the alveolus; the remainder of the section being completed with the forceps. Or the proceeding may be re- versed, and the cut made from the mouth up towards the nasal cavity. Should the disease chiefly implicate the upper- orbital and nasal portions of the bone, leavins: the cheek and roof of the mouth sound, another modification of the operation may be rrrrdertakerr by carrying the knife from the nasal process down the side of the nose and from the nostril across the cheek, dissecting up the flap thus formed, then applying a narrow-bladed saw fi’om the anterior nares across the superior maxilla above its alveolar ridge, making a perpendicrrlar errt from this into the orbit, arrd then applying the cutting pliers along these fines of incision, cutting through the superior maxilla, and finally detaching it by dividing with the forceps the nasal process and the orbital plate. 3. Complete Excision of the Upper Jaw.—The operation of excision of the whole of the upper jaw, together with the malar bone, for tumoiu- of the antrum, was first proposed by Lizars in 182G ; though Gensoul of Lyons was the first Surgeon by whom the operation was actually performed, iu May, 1820. Since then, it has been repeatedly practised ; and the names of Liston and of Fergusson are inseparably connected with it, for the skill mth -which they have devised, and the boldness -with which they have carried out the various steps of its performance. The patient should bo placed in a sitting or semi-recumbent position, oppo- site a good light. The Surgeon stands on the right of the patient. The facial artery should then be compressed as it passes round the lower ja-w ; or an acupressure-needle may be passed under it; and the hannon-hage from the incisions into the soft parts thus materially restrained. The parts to be re- I I Fig. 5S4, Lines of Incision in Liston’s Oiieiu- tion for Excision of Upper Jaw. VOL. II.482 DISEASES OF THE JAWS AND THEIR APPENDAGES. f f the cheek. This may be fashioned m various ways (see Figs. 584, 585, and 58G). The follow mg, which IS the method adopted.by Liston, will be foimd to be the most convenient where the tumour is very large (Fig. 584). In the fimt stage, the central incisor tooth on the diseased side having been extracted, the point of a bistoury is entered opposite the external angular iiro- cess of the frontal bone, and carried with a semicircular sweep into the angle Fi^. 5S5.- Excision of Uiiper Jaw by Liston’s Jletliod. of the mouth. From the upper end of this incision, a cut about one inch in length may be carried along the zygoma. Another incision is made from the nasal process of the superior maxillary bone, down to the side of the nose, i round the ala, which it detaches, and through the centre of the upper lip into the mouth. The flap thus formed is dissected upwards imtil the margin of the orbit is reached (Fig. 585) ; the soft parts are then carefully separated from the floor of this cavity, and drawn upwards by a curved copper spatula, I : which protects them and the globe of the eye. Or the line of incision by external flap (Fig. 58G) may be adopted in the ^ following way. The point of the knife is entered opposite the inner angle of f. the eye, and carried down the side of the nose, round the ala, and dovm the centre of the upper lip. Another incision is now made in a horizontal directionCOMPLETE EXCISION OF THE UPPER JAW. 483 below tlic orbit, by entering the point of the knife where the first incision has been ■commenced, and canying it directly outwards at the junction of the lower eyelid with the check, along the edge of the orbit as far as the zygoma. A flap is then formed and thrown outwards. 1 his line of incision has the great advantage over the one Tcprcscntcd in Fig. r>84, that the arteries •and nerves of the face arc cut near their ter- minations, and not through their larger branches. This line of incision, to which "C. Heath gives the in-eference, is most :suitable to tumours of moderate size. The next step in the operation consists in the di^^sion of the bones. This may best be done with a narrow saw and strong •cutting pliers ; the bone being first deeply notched with the saw, and then divided with the pliers ; the zygoma should be first cut across, the external orbital angle next di'S'ided in the same way, and then the internal angle cut through by putting- one blade of the forceps into the nostril and the other into the orbit (Fig. 080). The palatal arch must finally be cut across by notching it deeifiy with a Hey’s or a narrow-bladed saw, and then, passing the pliers into the mouth and nose, cutting through the line of the groove and the alveolus of the incisor that had been extracted. Or the whole of these steps may be reversed, as the tSurgeon finds most convenient. In cutting across the bones, the Surgeon may stand either before or behind the patient. In the third stage of the operation, the whole mass, having had its osseous j connections separated, is depressed, drawn forwards by the fingers on the “ lion ” I forceps, and readily removed by breaking down adhesions with the finger, or ; by the division of a few remaining soft parts with the bistoury or scissoi*s. 1 <L'are should be taken to leave the whole of the soft palate intact. I Should haamon-hage occur from any of the deeper vessels, this must be t sirrested by ligature, or by the application of the actual cautery. Some strips of dry lint, having a thread attached by which they can be removed when necessaiy, should then be pressed into the deeper part of the wound, •■and the cheek-flap laid down in proper position. It must be retained in siln byhare-hp pins through the upper lip, and by metallic sutures along the other lines of incision. However much the skin may ha\-e been stretched and thinned, inone should be removed unless it have been actually incorporated in or infil- trated by the tumour. After cicatrisation is complete, the deformity resultinn- from such a procedure will be far less than might at first be anticipated. , The result of operations for the removal of the upper jaAV is very satisfactory, so far as the operation itself is concerned. Though most serious the operation is not veiy dangerous. Of 17 consecutive cases coUected by utchinson as having been practised in the London Hospitals, it was successful n U ; and of IG ca.ses (10 of total and G of partial removal) done by Esmarch, 112 Fig. 5S0.—Line of Incision in Excision of the Upiier Jaw hy External Flan.484 DISEASES OF THE JA]VS AND TllEIll APPENDAGES. IB were successful (viz., B of the former and r> of the latter). So far as recur- rence of the disease is concerned, all will depend on the natiu’e of the tumoiu\ and the extent of the operation. If the disease he malig-nant or e'S’en myeloid,, speedy recurrence will certainly ensue if partial excision or scooping be prac- tised. Nothing, indeed, can be more disastrous than the result of partial operations in these cases. Even though the whole maxilla be excised, the- incisions being, carried Avide of the disease, recurrence is the inA-ariable rule, though the more complete operation secures longer immunity. The liability t» recurrence is remarkable in these cases, Avhen Ave consider how isolated the upper jaAv is, being bounded on tkree sides by the cavities of the mouth, nose, and orbit, and hoAV completely it can be excised. It is, I believe, mainly due tO' tAvo causes—early implication of the soft parts, and extension of the mischief through the fissures and sinuses behind the bone. These recurrent malignant groAvths, after removal of the primary tumour, do not admit of extirpation. When the tumour is benign, the result is most satisfactory and the enre- usually complete. Tumours that spi’iug from behind the Superior Maxilla haA’C already been adverted to in speaking of the diagnosis of tumours of the upper jaAv (p. 478). They may grow from the sphenoid bone, or from some of the deep caAnties lying betAveen it, the palate bones, and the ethmoid, constituting various foi’ms of naso-pharyngeal, palatine, or naso-palatine polypi. Formerly these tumours AverC' either left untouched, or Avere extirpated together with the- superior maxilla or after its removal. Of late years various operations have- been devised Avithout the necessity of removing that bone, which is either turned up, doAAm, or on one side. The best operation on the whole for their removal is Langenbeck’s Osteoplastic Section of the Superior MaxUla with displacement of that bone. The first operation was performed in 1859. Since- then, Langenbeck has performed it 13 times, with 10 complete ciu-es and B- deaths. It has also been performed in Germany by Esmarch, Wagner, Simon, Nussbaum, and Billroth. The last two performed it for removal of the superior maxillaiy nerve for neuralgia. In America it has been performed twice by Cheever. In one case, it was done for removal of a tumoiu- groAving from tho body of the sphenoid bone ; the tumour recuiTed, and the operation was repeated at the end of eleven months, AAuth perfect success. In the other case, both bones were displaced at the same operation ; but the patient died on the- fifth day of “ prostration Avith excitement.” In Langenbeck’s fii'st operation, the incision was made from the middle of the nasal eminence of the frontal bone towards the right, over the nasal process and downwards to the ala of the nose. The edges of the Avound were dissected up so as to expose- the whole nasal process of the superior maxillary bone and the nasal bone, the periosteum remaining untouched. The cartilaginous portion of the no c- was separated from its bony attachments. The nasal bone AAas the through with bone-forceps, close to the septum, and upwards as far as the ntsal process of the frontal bone; by a second cut the nasal piocess- S trsupcAr maxillary ,vas dh iclcd iato tho antrum.

The nose ivas thus fully OT)ened and tlie polyijus was remo^•ed. The bones were then replaced and.sup- iiorted in position by a plug of charpie. The wound healed readily, and there was no exfoliation of bone. Langenbeck’s second operation was undertaken for a tumour springing from behind the superior maxillary bone in the pterygo- maxillary fossa. Two incisions were made ; the first began at the inserhon of the ala nasi aud ran along the lower border of the malar bone, describing an arch with the convexity downwards and terminating at the'middle of the zygoma ; the second began at the nasal process of the frontal bone, and, fol- lowing tiie lower margin of the orbit, crossed the frontal process of the superior maxillary bone, and joined the lower incision. The soft parts were not dissected up. The lower incision was then carried to the bone, and the masseter dis- sected fr-om its attachment to the malar bone. By depressing the lower jaw so as to remove the coronoid process out of the way, the finger could be forced through the spheno-maxillary fossa, which was dilated by the tumour, into the nose through the sjiheno-palatine foramen. A narrow saw was now passed along the finger—its point being protected by the forefinger of the left hand intro- duced into the nostril—and a cut was made directly forwards through the ascending process of the palate bone and the body of the superior maxillary bone, across the caA’ity of the antrum, parallel to the hard palate and imme- diately above it. The ujiper incision was noiv deepened, and the soft parts Avere raised from the floor of the orbit and fr’om the angle betAveen the zygoma and the malar bone ; and, the saAv being again introduced, a cut Avas made through the malar bone into the spheno-maxillary fissure, and thence across the floor of the orbit as fiir as the lacrymal bone. The Avedge-shaped piece of the superior maxillary bone included betAveen these cuts Avas now only attached by its connections with the nasal and frontal bones, and by the soft parts covering it, Avhich were untouched. By introducing an elevator into the cut in the malar bone, the AAfrole piece Avas lifted up, bending upon its attachment to the nasal and fr’ontal bones as upon a hinge, until it Avas completely turned inwards and upwards over the opposite side of the face. The tumour, which Avas fomid to have extensive connections in the pterygo-maxiUary region, was now removed. The bone AA'as then replaced, and the Avound closed. On the sixth day, the gi-eater part of the Avound was healed ; on the sixteenth the Avound had com- pletely healed, and no mobility could be felt in the bone. Ollier remoA*ed a polyjms from the nasal fossa, by making a horseshoe-shaped incision from one ala of the nose up to the root, and then across the root and doAvn to the other ala. He then saAved through the nasal bones and the nasal process of the supeiior maxillary bone, and so opened uj) the supierior meatus of the nose. These operations have been successful in many cases Avhich would haA^e necessarily been fatal if left. But they must not be lightly undertaken, as the danger of the operation itself, and the possibility of death during or soon after its performance, must be borne in mind. There are thi*ee main sources o peril m t^hese cases, viz., hmmorrhage, asphyxia fr-om the passage of the blood into the pharynx and larynx, and shock to the nervous system, fr-om the close proximity of the operation to the base of the brain. The daiio-er of asphyxia from hmmon-hage into the air-passages may be obviated by a nre- Acntne tracheotomy, and the use of Trendelenburg’s apparatus.486 DISEASES OF THE JAWS AED THEIR ARRENDAOES. DISEASES OF THE LOWER JAW. TUiAiouRB not unli-cquently spring from the lower jaw. Like those in thc’ superior maxilla, they may either be simple or malig-nant. Amongst the simple,. Avc most commonly find the Fibro-cystic. Fibrous tumours are also occa- sionally met with, and more rarely Osseous and Enchondromatous growths. The malignant tumours are principally rapidly growing sarcomata. These '\-arious grow'ths frequently occur in early and middle life, and usually spring- fr-om the diploe between the two tables of which the bone is composed. They project into the mouth and on the side of the neck, forming large rounded unifonn, or imperfectly lobed masses. Occasionally malignant diseases spring- fr’om the neighbourhood of the bone, and, without invading its structure,, envelop it so as to give rise to an appearance of morbid implication of it. In the Gijstio and Fibro-cystic Tumours of the jaw, the growth, is expanded into cysts, having more or less solid matter iutennixed, partaking of the character of epulis. The cysts are of various degrees of thickness; some being thin and membranous, others having the walls partly composed of fibrous- tissue, and others again ha-sing expanded bony lamellae largely entering into- their composition, so that on pressure they occasionally communicate the semi- crepitant sensation pecidiar to the cystic expansions of the osseous structure. The fluid contained in these cysts is a viscid liquid, usually semi-transparent, yelloAvish, or bloody. Diagnosis.—In the lower, as in the upper jaw, it is of great importance to- diagnose the simple fi’om the malignant affections; as in the latter form of disease an operation is rarely justifiable, the soft tissues aroimd the bone being- usually implicated to such an extent as not to admit of removal, and conse- quently not of the full and complete extirpation of the disease. The malignant tumours may generally be readily detected by the rapidity of their gxowth, by their pulpy or elastic character, and by infiltration of neighbouring parts, wfitli implication of the glands below the jaw. Treatment.—The treatment of tumours of the lower jaw depends in a great measure upon the character of the growth. In cystic tumour of moderate size, with thin walls and but little deposit of fibrous tissue around the cysts, the best mode of treatment consists in cutting down through the gum on the expanded portion of bone, opening the cyst by means of the antrum-perforator, small trephme, or cutting pliers, according to its size and the thickness of its walls r letting out the fluid contained within ; and then, by introducing a plug of lint, causing the cavity to granulate from the bottom, and gradually to contract. When the cysts are so large that they have destroyed the integrity of the bone, or when they are associated with a large quantity of fibrous tissue, so as to constitute true fibro-cystic tumom-s, excision of the diseased bone must be prac- tised. This, also, is the only plan of treatment that can be had recourse to in other affections of this bone. „ . . „ l- e- Excision of the Lower Jaw.—The operation of excision of a portion o the lower jaw for tumour of that bone was first performed by Deadi-^k of Ten- nessee, in 1810, and not, as is generally but eiToneously supposed, by Dupiiytaui. As the gi-owths for which this operation is perfomed are usually situated .)c- twecn the symphysis and the angle of the bone, seldom exten mg eyonEXCISION OF THE LOWER JAW. 48; middle line, the operation is generally limited to one side of the face. In some instances, however, the tumour may encroach so far that it may be Mcessary to remove more than the half of the bone ; and in other cases again, though of veiT rare occim-ence, the whole of the bone has been disarticulated. When the tumour is of moderate size, and is situated about midway hehveen the symphysis and anyte of the jaw, it may be reached by making a semilunar- incision of sufficient length under the lower edge of the bone, and canying the- anterior extremity of it well forward upon the chin, but not dividing, if pos- sible, the lower lip, nor cutting into the angle of the mouth ; then dissecting- up the flap thus formed, and canying the knife cautiously along the inner side of the jaAV, so as to detach the mucous membrane of the mouth and the mylo- hyoid muscle to a sufficient extent. In doing this, the hemorrhage is often veiy profuse : the bleeding from the facial artery is particularly forcible, the blood being throiTO in a larger and stronger jet than would seem possible fiom the size of the vessel. The hemorrhage should be at once controlled by the application of ligatures to both ends of the bleeding artery, and to any other points from which it is more than usually abundant. Unless this be done, the after steps of the operation will be rendered much more obscure and difficult. One of the teeth on each side of the tumour having been prcvdously drawn, the jaw must now be deeply notched through their alveoli into its base -with a naiTow strong-backed saw, and cut through with pliers, or completely divided with the saw. After the fragment of diseased bone, with the attached tumour, has been removed, and aU bleeding vessels have been secured, the flap of cheek should be laid down smoothly, and retained in situ by means of hare-lip pins. Occasionally the dental artery in the cut jaw gives trouble ; the hemorrhage from this source may be checked by the application of a piece of solid per- chloride of iron. In aU operations for the removal of portions of the lower jaw, it is most important to avoid, as flu* as possible, opening up the mucous membrane of the mouth, so as to prevent the entrance into the buccal cavity of blood dining the operation, and of discharges after it. The patient must be fed with slops, which should be sucked in through a tube. At a later period, when cicatrisation is well advanced, the teeth should be tied together with strong silver wire ; or a silver cap should be fitted upon the teeth of the two portions of bone that are left, and attached by an elastic spring to another silver cap put on those of the upper jaw, so as to prevent the displacement that would otherwise occur in the smaller Iragment. Union takes place after a time by fibrous tissue, w^hich becomes sufficiently dense to make the jaw strong and useful. In those cases in which the tumour eno'oaclies upon the angle and ramus of the jaw, it is usually better to remove the bone at the articulation on the affected side ; for, if the articular end including the coronoid process be left, it -will be displaced forwards and upw'ards by the action of the temporal and external pterygoid muscles, and be a source of much incom cnience and irrita- tion to the patient, not compensated by any coiTesponding utihty. In these cases, the removal of one lateral half of the jaw will consequently be required, and the operation may be performed in the following way. The point of a strong bistoury or scalpel should be entered immediately behind the articulation, carried down the posterior margin of the ramus behind the angle, and under488 DISEASES OF THE JAWS AND THEIR APPENDAGES. the Iwdy of the bone beyond the anterior limits of the tumour, where it must \ Fig. 587.—Excision of Lower Jaw.

The knife is then carried behind tlic jaw in front of the tumour, and, one of the incisor teeth having been extracted l^eforc the operation commenced, a saw should be applied to the bone in this situation, and its section finished by means of the cutting-pliers (Fig. 587); the Surgeon then dissects under and around it; in this situation a scali>el, curved on the fiat, wll be found useful, the edge of the knife being kept close to the bone and tumour. When he has cleared the tumour and ramus, he depresses the body of the bone forcibly with his left hand, in order more readily to divide the attachment of the temporal muscle to the coronoid ]3rocess. This having been done, the only part left is the disarticulation, which is best effected by opening the joint Ifom the fr'out, whilst the bone is well depressed and twisted somewhat out- wards, the edge of the knife being kept close to its neck, scraping the bone so as, if possible, to avoid wounding the internal maxillary artery, when, any remaining attachments having been cut through, the disarticulation is effected (Fig. 588). In depressing the bone to reach the temporal muscle and the joint, care must be taken not to use too much force, lest it happen that the ramus give way, ha\ing been weakened by the disease ; this accident would produce a good deal of trouble in remo’'idng the fragment left behind, which can only be done by seizing it with necrosis-forceps, thus dragging it fo wards, and then dividing the muscle and capsule. Should the internal maxillary artery have been divided, it must be ligatured, or the termination of the external carotid, where the vessel dmdes into the temporal and internal maxillary, tied : any other branches that bleed will necessarily also require the ligature. The ca^ ity, having been lightly filled with lint, should then be left to granulate ; the cheek being laid down and attached along the line of incision by hare-lip pins and twisted sutures. A kind of fibrous tissue forms in place of the jaw that has been removed, and comparatively little deformity results. When the disease of the bone extends beyond the symphysis, a thick ligatm-e should be passed through the end of the tongue, which must be drawn forwards by an assistant, lest, on the division of the insertion of its muscles into the lower jaw, be forcibly retracted into the pharynx, and thus threaten or even occasion suffocation, as has happened to Surgeons of eminence both in France and in America, f operations for it, see Chapter XLYT.; and for tracheotomy m operations on the jaws, see Chapter LX.49° PLASTIC SURGERY OF THE FACE AND MOUTH. Yol. I.) to the performance of plastic operations on the permanim. In tde CHAPTEE LVIII. — < PLASTIC SURGERY OF THE FACE AND MOUTH. By Plastic or Reparative Surgery is meant the performance of opera- tions for the repair of deficiencies in structure, whether resulting from injury, from disease, or from malformation. It has been long knoAvn that partially detached portions of the body may retain their 'vitality sufficiently to become again adherent, when attached but by a very narrow tongue of tissue to the part from which they have been all but separated. This has often been observed in injuries of the face and fingers, portions of which have been nearly completely severed, and yet have- united again on being replaced. But there is a sufficient number of cases on record to show that certain parts, when completely separated, may, after being- rejjlaced, again become adherent. The most remarkable instances of this kind are those which are related by Hoffacher, and attested by Chelius and Yelpeau. Hoffacher was officially appointed to attend as Sm’geon at the duels which were at one time frequent amongst the students at Heidelberg ; and, as at these encounters broad-swords w^ere used, he had an opportunity of seeing a. considerable nmnber of incised wounds, and has related no fewer than sixteen cases in which portions of the nose, bps, or chin had been sliced off, and, being- put on again, contracted adhesions. Amongst the most remarkable of these,, is one in which the end of the nose was sliced off by a cut with the broad- sword, and fell under a chest of drawers; it was not found for some time, but, on being recovered and washed, was stitched on, and became firmly attached. In another instance, a dog that was in the room snapped up the detached portion of the organ as it fell to the gTOund, but the nose, being immediately taken out of the animal’s mouth and put on again, becam& fii’mly fixed. In order that union shoidd take place between parts that have been separated completely or nearly so, and the rest of the body, it is necessary that they be soft and -vascular, and more especially that then structure be of a homogeneous character, such as is met -wdth in the tissues of the face ; where no very large blood-vessels, nen-es, tendons, or bones are found. It is the same in plastic operations, which succeed best under similar conditions of tissue, and which are conducted on the same principle as an attempt at ivnion in a partially severed structure. It is principally for defonnities and loss of the nose and hp that plastic operations are of much service; they may, however, occasionally be had recourse to in other situations, as about the cheeks and eyelids, but seldom with an equal amount of success. Reference has afready been made (p.PLASTIC OPEEATIOXS. 49] pi-ictice of this very interesting brancli of surgery, there is much opportunity lor the display of manual dexterity. On this, indeed, almost the whole success, of the operation depends ; and a vast deal may be done in apparently the most unpromising cases by management, skill, and patience. In these operative- procedures the names of Serres, 1 )ieffenbach, Liston, Fergusson, Sedillot, B. Langcnbeck, and .Jobert, deservedly take the first rank. In p'erformiug the various plastic operations, four methods ha^-e been employed. In the first, the fiap of skin that is intended to repair the lost structure is transplanted from a distant part, as the arm. T.his operation, which was introduced by the Italian Surgeon, Tagliacotius, and hence com- monly called by his name, has in a gTcat measm-e fallen into disuse, on account of the difticulty of its execution, and the great uncertainty ol obtaining a successful result. The second plan consists in transplanting the repaiatLe- stineture fi'om some part in the neighbourhood of the organ to be repaired ; the skin from the forehead, for instance, being used for the formation of a new nose ; that from the chin for the restoration of a lost lip. This procedui’c, which seems firet to have been adopted by the natives of India in restoring the loss of the nose, is the method that is most commonly employed in this country in plastic operations on the face. The third method consists in loosening the skin by a process of subcutaneous section to some distance aromid the part to be repaired, and then drawing it forwards with or without incision through its substance. This gliding operation is chiefiy practised for the closure of fistulous openings. The foiu’th method is employed in cases where an abnormal fissure exists in a part. It consists in bringing together and imiting the edges of the fissure, after having pared them evenly, so as to expose their vascular siudaces. Union in plastic operations is effected by primary adhesion between the raw Burfiices Avhich are brought into contact. Should, however, this mode of union fail from any accidental circumstance, the Surgeon need not despair ; as the parts may unite by adhesive inflammation, or even through the medium of granulation, in a very satisfactory and complete manner. For proper union to be effected, it is necessary that the edges be cleanly and evenly cut, so as to adjust themselves accurately to one another. This may often be most skilfully effected by making the incision in the paid that is to receive the flap somewhat oblique or bevelled, thus securing a more accurate adaptation of the edges. After the flap has been formed aud the part in which it is to be transplanted properly pared, the operation should be delayed a few minutes until all bleed- ing has ceased. This is of much importance, as the interposition of a layer of coagidated blood will materially interfere with imion. In bringing the parts into apposition, gi’eat care must be taken that no- undue traction or constriction be exercised, lest their circulation be interfered with, and their vitality be endangered. The parts may be maintained in apposition by sutines, collodion, or the application of a strip of isinglass plaster. The sutures should be as fine as possible, introduced with a small needle, and knotted on the sound parts. Occasionally, as in hare-lip, pins may advantageously be used. In some instances, instead of sutures, a small spring-forceps (Fig. 80), termed aFACE AND MOUTH. 492 PLASTIC SUllGEUr OF THE serrefute, may Ijo employed, but most generally iuten-upted sutures are the best. The use of collodion, u’here applicable, is of gr-eat adA'antage in plastic surgery, as it not only secures adhesion, but, by excluding the air, lessens the chance of suppuration. For a plastic procedure to succeed, it is absolutely necessary that no morbid action be going on in the seat of operation ; and not only that none be actually in progress, but that all have ceased for some considerable time. This is more particularly the case Avhen the deformity for the remedying of Avhich it is practised has resulted from syphilitic or cancerous ulceration. In both cases it is necessary to see that the constitution is sound, as well as that all local disease has been eradicated ; otherwise the irritation of the operation might sot it up again, and the new flap might be invaded and destroyed. From Avant of this precaution, I have more than once seen disappointment result. "When an operation, as on the nose or hp, is performed for cancroid disease, ablation of the morbid part may be done at the moment of operating—the afiection being a local one ; when for struma or syphilis, the disease is consti- tutional, and care must be taken that all morbid action has thoroughly and completely ceased. As a general rule, plastic operations practised for the re- j)air of mutilations from injmy, or of congenital deficiencies, are more successful than those that are performed after disease. No routine system of treatment should be adopted ; but a few days of rest, good diet, and a dose or tAA'o of aperient medicine, may be prescribed before the operation is proceeded Avith. In the after-treatment of the case, a nourish- ing but unstimulating regimen should be observed. Burow’s Operation.—A plastic operation specially suited for the repair of deformity consequent on the removal of morbid growths from the cheeks and other parts of the face, has been introduced by BuroAV, a Pohsh Smgeou, and successfully performed and described by Stokes (Fig. 589). The steps are as fol- lows. The growth to be removed is included in three incisions, 1, 2, 3 ; and the integuments fr-om AAdiich it sprmgs are then care- fully dissected off, leaAing a raw triangle, the apex of which is on one, the base on the other side of the tumour. The incision 1, 4, 8, is then carried outAA-ards to 5, 8, 7, so that the Avhole distance fr'om 1 to i is exactly three times that of the base of the raAv surface ; a second triangle, 5, (!, 7, is then made, having its base on the outer third of this horizontal incision. The tAA^o triangles must be of equal size, and the integuments are dissected off 5, 6, 7. Tliere ai-e thus two raw smfrices to be covered in. This is done by dissecting up carefully the flaps 1, 5, G, and 2, 3, t. AVhen this is done, the points 1 and 8, and 5 and 7, are respectively diwAm together, each by one suture, and the two raw triangular surffrccs arc tluis covered in. fi */ Fig. 680.—Liiie.s of Iiieisio3i in Buvow’s Operation.493 nLEPUAllOPLAHTY. Operations of various kinds arc frequently performed on the eyelids, which •are truly of a plastic character. • i • Blepharoplasty, or the operation hy which the eyelids arc repaired, is occasionally required for loss of substance—the result of wounds, cicatrices, or operations. It is loss satisfactory in its results than most of the other plastic procedures about the face ; yet it may, in some cases, improve materially the patient’s appearance. When the upper eyelid requires repair, the flap is taken from the forehead ; when it is the lower lid, from the cheek or temple. This operation may be performed either by the gliding method, or by twisting a flap into its new situation. By the gliding method, a triangular flap is cut and partially detached (Fig. 5!)(), cb), and then (h’awn gently forwards until it coiresponds to and fills up the gap that requires repair, when it is there fixed by a few points of suture. "lITien the twisting method is employed, an oval flap is detached (Fig. 590, V), except its jiediclc, and twisted down, to be planted on the raw surface. Occasionally neither of these methods is applicable ; and then the procedure, that I successfully adopted in a case of which the annexed cut (Fig. 591) is a representation, may be followed. In this case, which was that of a lady who had received a severe mutilation of the face by the explosion'of a ginger-beer bottle, there was a deep and hard cicatrix across the lower eyelid, causing- depression and eversion of its outer portion, and adhesion of the inner part to the ball of the eye. After dividing the adhesions and removing the cicatrix, I made a semilunar incision so as to dissect up the eyelid, and then fixed it by points of suture in its new situation, when it became firmly adherent (Fig. 592), and scarce any apparent deformity was left.

In both these cases, the eyeball, having been injured, had become atrophied, with opacity of the cornea.

Ehix0P].astic Operations occasionally require to be performed for the restoration of the form of the nasal organ, which has been destroyed by injury •or disease. This branch of plastic surgery has long received much attention, nnd has been reduced to distinct rules. Either the entire nose, or a portion, may demand operation. Columna.—When the columna and a portion of the septum are destroyed, {I large gap is left at the nasal apertm’e ; and, the nose becoming flattened in ■consequence of its tip falling in, gi’eat deformity necessarily results. The upper lip also, losing that amount of support which it receives from the columna, becomes pendulous, projecting, and thickened at the end, thus adding to the disfigiu’ement. The restoration of the columna is effected from this thickened and prominent upper lip, which, by being reduced in size, is rendered far more shapely. The operation consists in cutting through the whole length of the lip from above downwards on each side of the mesial line, so as to leave a tongue about one-third of an inch in width. This is then turned up ; and its ends being well pared, and the under surface of the tip of the nose properly vmfied, it is fixed by means of a fine hare-lip pin and twisted sutiue, which should be left in for about foiu days. Union takes place in a few days ; but until this is firm, the new columna must be properly supported with naiTOw strips of plaster fixed to the cheek on each side. No twisting of this small flap is required, as the mucous surface speedily becomes cutaneous, and vice versa. The division in the upper lip must be treated in the same way as an ordinary hare-lip, and unites without difficulty, lessening greatly ihe deformity in this part. Ala.—When one ala only is deficient, the rest of the nose being sound, one of three processes may be adopted to remedy the deformity. 1. ^^Tien a small portion only of the free border or of the tip has been lost, an incision should be made (Fig. 593) across the nose, and the remains of the ala and a portion of the nasal integument thus marked out dis- sected down, and attached to the end of the organ. In this way a very excellent result may be obtained. 2. If the loss of substance be greater, a flap of skin, of the proper shape to restore the deformity, may be raised fr-om the cheek, applied to the previously pared edges of the part requiring it, and fixed there by a few points of fine sutm-e. 8 If the loss of the substance of the ala be very considerable, or if it extend to apart of the body of the nose, then it is more efiiciently restored by brmg- ino- a long narrow flap from the forehead in a way that wiU immediately be de- libed. In the majority of cases, the destruction of the ala and of the ^0^7 scri of the nose is so required for the repair of the deformity. Entire Nose.—For the restoration of the entire nose, two pioccdurca considerable, that other plans, to be presently described, areINDIAN RHINO PLASTIC OPERATION. 495 have been employed: viz., 1, the Tagliacotian Operation; 2, the Indian Operation. J. The Tagliacotian Operation consists in taking the integument and areolar tissue required for the repair of the lost organ from the inside of the arm. Here a flap of sufficient e.xtcnt is to be marked out and dissected up with its subjacent areolar tissue, leaving it merely attached to the limb by a root at its distal end. No attempt at fixing this flap to the nose should be made for at least a fortnight, during which time it should be kept upon a piece of Avet lint, and allowed to thicken, gi’anulate, and become A'ascular, so as to fit itself for adhesion to the new surface to Avhich it is to be applied. The remains of the deformed nose having then been properly pared and the flaj) shaped, they must, after all bleeding has ceased, be properly adjusted and fixed to one another by points of suture. The arm must then be closely attached to the head, so as to be as nearly as possible immovable. At the end of about ten days, AA’hen adhesions have taken place, the connecting medium may be cut across, and the part left to be supported by the Autality which it may gain from the new surface to which it is now attached. This process is comparatively seldom had recourse to, for obvious reasons. The uncertainty of maintaining the vitality in the flap, the extreme tediousness of the prolonged constrained position in which it is necessaiy to keep the patient, and the great difficulty of guai-ding against movements of the arm, especially during sleep, and which, however slight and involuntary, would be sufficient to disturb union between the opposed surfaces, and occasion the failure of the operation, have caused this plan of procedure to fall into disuse ; aud it is now, I believe, universally abandoned by Surgeons in this country, having been replaced by the more certain procedure, which will now be described, of borrowing the skin for the, new nose from the forehead. 2. The Indian Operation, a knowledge of which was brought to this country by Carpue in 1814, is extremely successful in its results, though re- quiring a good deal of nicety for its proper execution. The operative pro- cedures required by this method are somewhat complex, and may conveniently be divided into three distinct periods : 1, the Dissection of the Flap from the Forehead, and its Attachment to its new situation : 2, the Separation of the Foot of the Flap where it is tmmed down from the Forehead, and the Formation of a proper Bridge to the Nose ; 3, the Formation of tlie Columna Nasi. 1. Formation and Attachment of the Flap.—In the shaping of the flap, cai-e must be taken that it is of sufficient size ; as during the after-part of the treatment it often has a tendency to shrivel,'and more inconvenience usuaUy results from its not having originally been made large enough, than the revem. The size adapted to the particular face may best be judged of by moulding a thin piece of gutta-percha to the nose, then flattening it out by dipping it in hot water, and using this as the guide for marking the outline ot tlie flap upon the forehead. This should be traced with tincture of iodine Avffiieh wifl not be Avashed off so readily as ink by the flow of blood, Avhich is often rather free. This flap should be of the shape in Fig. 594, taking care I at it IS rather square at the angles, and not too much rounded off. The sizeAvill necessarily vary according to the character of the countenance, and the496 PLASTIC SUPGERY OF THE FACE AND AIOUTII.

When the whole of the nose requires restoraMon, it is usnally necessary to make it abont two and a half to three inches in length, by abont the same in width at the broadest part. It may either be taken from the middle of the forehead, or obliquely from one side : if the latter, the right side is the most con- venient. It must now be dissected off the forehead ; in doing this, care must be taken to cut the flap as thick as possible, especially at its root between the eyebrows. It must also be but little handled, and, above all, not pinched, either with fingers or forceps. The dissection should be com- menced at the root, so that the outline may not be obscured by blood ; and this part should be left long, in order to admit afterwards of a very gradual and easy twist. In order to facilitate this, it is also desirable to make the incision on the right side a little lower than that on the left. After the flap has been raised throughout the whole of its extent, a piece of wet lint should be applied to the forehead, with a view of arresting the bleeding, before the next step is taken. This consists in paring the surface and edges of the stump of the nose, and removing the integu- ments from it in such a way as to leave a triangidar raw surface. In doing this care must be taken—whilst a good base of attachment is left—not to remove the parts too widely, lest the cheeks, by separating, have a tendency to gape too much, and the nose to become flattened out. The integuments also should be dissected away in such a manner as to form a deep groove shelving inwards, so as to receive and hold the flap more securely and Avith less overlapping of the edges. The operation must now be discontinued for a few minutes until all bleeding has ceased, and the cut surfaces have be- come glazed ; this point is of great importance in securing direct adhe- sion, and must be carefully attended to. The bleeding having been arrested by exposure to the air, and by the tor- sion rather than the ligature of any spouting branch, the flap fr’om the forehead should be brought down by a twist fr’om' left to right, and attached by a few points of fine suture on each side to the edge of the ineision, around the nasal aperture. A pledget of soft lint, moderately greased, should now be gently insinuated under the flap, the lower part of the incision in the forehead drawn together by a point of suture, but not so as to constrict the root in any way, and the rest of the exposed surfaee covered with water-di'cssing.

The patient should be put to bed with a piece of soft lint laid over the whole of the face, so as to maintain its temperature ; and, if it be winter, he must be placed in a room that is kept well warm day and night. The diet for the first lew clays •should be simple, but abundant, consisting chiefly of nutritious slops. The di’essings must not be disturbed for three days : by this time, if all go well, the flap will be found somewhat tumid, warm, and sensitive, but pule in colour. The plug in the nose will now require changing, lest it be rendered offensive by the discharges ; its withdrawal and the substitution of another must be clone with the greatest gentleness, the Surgeon bearing in mind that any undue pressure or traction may destroy adhesions, and prove latal to the vitality of the flap. If the sutimes produce no in-itation, they may be left in till the fifth or sixth day, by which time the adhesions will be tolerably perfect, and they may with safety be cut and withdrawn. As the adhesions strengthen and the vitahty of the flap improves, it must be elevated by putting imderneath it a larger plug of lint; for which, after a time, may be substituted a small gutta-percha tube moidcled to the figure of the inside of the nose. (Edema of a somewhat sohd character is apt to come on in the flap, giri'ng it a white appeai’ance ; but this is of little moment, and will gradually subside as the circulation through it becomes more actively established. The flap gradually becomes thicker and firmer, thi’owing out granulations from its under surface, which eventually becomes clothed with mucous membrane. The wound in the forehead must be ch-essed like an ordinary ulcer, and be well touched with nitrate of silver from time to time, to insure its contraction. It usually cicatrises with great readiness, and leaves remarkably little deformity. 2. Separation of the Root of the Plap.—This may be done about a month after the flap has been fashioned, when its vascularity, through its lateral adhesions, vill be perfected. The division of the root is best done by passing a narrow-bladed bistoury under the twist, and cutting upwards towards the eyebrows, removing a wedge-shaped portion of the soft parts, so as to make a smooth and proper bridge. 3. Formation of theColumnaSTasi.—The addition of the columna is nowaU that is wanted to make the nose complete. This must be made from the upper lip, perhaps at the same time when the bridge is fashioned ; and it may be cut and fixed in the way that has been already described in speaking of the restora- tion of this feature, the interior of the apex of the new nose having been well pared to receive it. The columna requires to be well supported by means of a nan’ow strip of plaster passing from one cheek to the other, and usually requires a good deal of fashioning before it is perfect; indeed, this is the part of the operation that I have found always most troublesome, and requiring most attention. • I he new nose must continue to be supported fi’om beneath, for some months a ter its formation, by plugs of lint or small gutta-percha tubes, as it will evince a gieat tendency to contract and to alter in its general outline and shape ; be- coming, if the Surgeon be not careful, either depressed or dumpy.

The success of the case will depend very greatly upon the minute attention which the Sm-geon bestows on the details of the operation, and on the care which he takes in the after-treatment. During the operation, the chief points to be attended to are, that the flap be made of sufficient size, that all oozing have ceased before the cut edges are brought into contact, and that no tension nor constriction be exercised. A principal source of failure in the operation, or in the result so far as concerns the after-appearance of the patient, is gangrene of the flap, in whole or in part, arising from the root being too narrow or too tightly twisted, or from the flap being too roughly handled in its dissection. So also, if it be cut too small and not properly supported afterwai-ds, the result will not be very satisfactory. Other acci- dents occasionally happen ; thus, erysipelas may oeem’, destroying at once the vitality of the flap, or coming on at a later period, and causing the new nose to slough under the attack of inflammation, which it has not sufficient vitality to resist, as happened in one of Liston’s earlier cases; or the new uose may be destroyed by a retiun of the lupus which proved destructive to the old one. Haemorrhage may also occur from underneath the flap. In the last case operated on by Liston just before his death, and which was com- pleted by Morton at University College Hospital, hiemorrhage to the extent of more than a pint took place on the ninth day, without any evident cause, from under the flap, and could only be arrested by plugging. Fiuther, the operation is not without its dangers. Dieffenbach lost two patients out of six on whom he operated in Paris ; their constitutions having probably been in an unfavourable state. The operation as just described will usually be attended by very satisfoctory Fig. 597.—Patient before Eliinoplastic Operation. Fig. 59S.—Same Patient some months after Operation.OSTEO-REINOPLA STY. 499 results. Of late years some modifications have been introduced into it. Thus Langenbeck recommends that the periosteum should be dissected up from the frontal bone together Avith the skin-flap, in order that, by the after-develop- ment of osseous tissue, a finner and better organ should be left. It has been feared by some Surgeons that the exposure of the frontal bone, by stripping off its periosteum, would probably be followed by necrosis. Experience has, however, shomi that this fear is groundless, as, indeed, might have been infen-ed from analogous conditions often observed in injuries' of the head, in which large portions of the pericranium may be detached -without the •e.xposed bone losing its -vitality. But it appears to me that there are more serious objections to “ Osteo-llhinoplasty,” and that it is an unnecessary com- plication of the operation to turn down the pericranium in the nasal flap, for two reasons. First, the pericranium is very firmly attached to the bone, and very loosely to the integumental structures, which glide over it. From the bone it is not detached without difficulty and the necessity of a •certain degree of scraping, by which its vitality is not unlikely to be impaired to so great a degree that it would be of no service as a bone-producing organ in the new nose, and would not improbably, when twisted down, slough away from insufficient vascular supply. Secon^y, even if the pericranial lining of the new nose were to retain its bone-producing power, it seems to me that an osseous layer inside that organ would rather be a disadvantage than of service, and would certainly expose it to greater risk of fracture and other injury than if such brittle material as a thin shell of bone did not enter into its ■composition. The operation practised by Ollier appears to me to be less happy than many of that excellent Singeon’s suggestions. It consists in cutting down the nasal process of the superior maxilla, and then bending it across so as to form a kind of bridge, on which to sustain the integumento-pericranial j Fig. 599. -Opening into Anterior Xnres. 1 Pig. 000.—Opening into .\nterior Nnres closed by Oi)eriition.. flap deflected from to the bridge of the the forehead. But by doing this the lateral supports new nose are removed, and necrosis of the bent or rather K K 2500 PLASTIC SURGEIIY OF THE FACE AND MOUTH. broken fragment of bone, which has actually occuiTed, is not an unlikely accident. Fistulous Opexixgs a'lmouGH the Nasal Bohes leading into the in- terior of the nostrils are occasionally mot witli. Such apertures as these are, perhaps, best closed by paring the edges, and then bringing forward a flap of neighbouring skin by the gliding operation. In some cases of this kind, pro- cedures may be required, in which the Siu’geon may display much ingenuity and benefit his patient greatly. The cuts represent a case many years since- under my care, before and the day after operation, in which a large apertine- into the side of the nose, resulting from necrosis of the left nasal bone con- sequent on scarlatina (Fig. 5!) 9), was successfully closed by a flap of skin taken from the forehead by the twisting process (Fig. COO). The patient, who was a child at the time of the operation, has since grown into a comely woman,, presenting scarcely a trace of the operation. Operation for Depressed Nose.—Sometimes the nose is depressed and flattened in consequence of the loss of the cartilages, vomer, and septum,, though the external parts remain entire. Dieffenbach has proposed a plan for raising it by slitting it longitudinally into three pieces ; dissecting the lateral slips from the osseous attachments ; paring the edges to such an extent that they overlap, and stitching them together; then bringing the whole organ forwards by pushing long hare-lip pins across its base, so as to elevate and narrow its attachments, which are brought more into the mesial line. Fergnsson has. improved this procedure by not slitting the nose down, but dissecting it away fr’om the bones from within the nostril, and then pushing long steel-pointed silver needles across from cheek to cheek, and twisting their ends over per- forated pieces of sole-leather, through Avhich they had previously been passed,, thus bringing the whole organ bodily forwards. The columna is next fashioned in the way ivhich has already been described ; and the nose is completed. PLASTIC SURGERY OP THE LIP. Hare-lip.—By hare-lip is meant a congenital perpendicular fissure or fissm’es through the upper lip, the result of an arrest of development. The condition thus produced in man is, according to Geofih’oy St. Hilaire, not analogous to what is met with in the hare, but to that which ocem’s in animals of a lower gvade of organisation—in fishes. The arrest of development takes place at the outer border of the intermaxillary bones, and is usually asso- ciated with a certain amount of disunion or malformation at the line of junction between these and the superior maxillary bones. When the arrest of develop- ment takes place on one side only, the hare-lip is said to be Single (Fig. 60f). In it the mesial side of the gap is usually rounded; the outer edge is flattened; and the frasnum at the angle is long and subcutaneous. It most frequently, so far as I have observed, occurs upon the left side. Not unfrequently there is a fissure on each side of the mesial line ; and then the hare-hp is said to be Double (Figs. 602, 603). AVhen double, the fissure is deeper on one side than on the other, and usually extends into the nostril, and is associated ivith cleft palate ; though sometimes it stops short of this. In these cases the nose is usually flattened and expanded, and between the fissures there is always a central or medium lobule, consisting of the intermaxillary bones m a nidi-AGE FOR OPERATION IN HARE-LIP. mcntaiT condition; to this a triangular labial nodule r many cases this is pushed forwards, and tilted on its base, so that the I'i},'. 001.—Single Here-liii.

Sometimes the projection is so con- siderable that it is at- tached to the tip of the nose. Median fissure is so rare that there are scarcely nny authentic cases of it in the records of surgery. Delahaye, however, mentions one instance of mesial fissiu'o of the upper lip with two lateral fissures, and Isicati has described one in the lower lip, the only case of the kind that I have met with on' record. The cleft in hare-hp coiTCsponds to the line of junction between the embryonic intermaxillary bones and the superior maxilla. The fissme, when single, may be confined to the lip ; but in the majority of cases it extends to the alveolus of the upper jaw, giving rise to a deep notch between the outer incisor and the caniue tooth. When it is double, the fom incisors, usually imperfectly and irregularly de- veloped, are included in the central intermaxillary tubercle. Meckel and Nicati have described a rare foim of hare-lip, in which the fissm’e coiTesponds to the line of junction between the central and lateral incisors. In many cases the fissure extends back into the palate ; this more frequently happens when the hare-lip is double, and in these cases every variety of palatal deformity is met Anth (Fig. 60-1). Age for Operation.—The cure of hare-lip can only be effected by a properly •conducted operation. In the performance of this, the first point that has to be determined is the age at A\diich it should be done. On this there has been, •and is still, a good deal of difference of opinion. Surgeons generally arc, hoAV- ever, 1 think, agreed that it is better not to perform the operation during den- tition ; at all events not during the cutting of the incisor teeth, Avhen there is much local excitement and general in-itability of the nervous system ; but they are not agreed as to Avhether it should be done before or after dentition. In support of the opinion that it is more prudent to Avait until after this period, it is alleged that very young infants arc especially liable to convulsions ; that the perfonnance of operations on them is troublesome ; and that it interferes Avith. suckling. These statements, however, are not can'icd out by Avhat Ave meet Fig. 604.—Skeleton of Jaw iu Double Hiire-liii, ami Cleft Palate502 PLASTIC SURGERY OF THE FACE AND MOUTH. Tvith in practice. There is no evidence to show that there is any danger in operating during early infancy; on the contrary, very young children, those but a few weeks or months old, bear operations remarkably well. I have repeatedly operated at these tender ages, not only for hare-lip, but for hernia, the removal of tumours and na3vi, the division of tendons, &c., and have never- seen any bad result follow. Besides this, the performance of the operation is easier at a very early age than when the child has reached its first or second year ; when, its intelligence being more developed, it knows what it has to suffer, and screams and struggles more than a very young infant does, whenever it sees the Surgeon, or when he makes an attempt to examine the wound or dressings. After the operation, also, the child wdll, wheir young, take to the breast rvithout difficulty and with the greatest avidity. The act of suction is advantageous, as in it the sides of the incision are more closely compressed and brought together. At very early ages, union of the wound takes place with great readiness and solidity ; and, as no time has been given for the rest of the fea- tures to become distorted, there vdll not be that permanent flattening and deformity of the face which is apt to continue after the hare-lip is cured, if the operation be defeiTed to a more advanced age. For these various reasons I agree with Dubois, Fergusson, and Butcher, that the operation had best be performed early; if possible, at about the sixth week after birth, or from that to the third month, which may, I think, be considered the time of election for this procedure. At this time the vitahty of the child is good, and the tissues are not so lacerable as at an earlier age. The operation may safely be performed at a much earlier period in single than in double hare-lip ; and the greater the deformity, the more marked the intermaxillary projection, the wiser wiU it be to defer operation, which not only becomes increasingly severe with the extent of the deformity, but after the performance of wffiich the traction on the pins becomes too great for the tender tissues to sustain. Should circumstances require it, however, the operation might be done at a much earlier period than that advised above. Thus, at the mgent solicitations of the parents, I hav& performed it within the first twenty-fom hours after birth, and several times during the first w'eek. But in these very early days of life the operation is not "without danger ; the "vitality of the child is often feeble, it suffers greatly from the loss of even a very small quantity of blood, and the tissues are so lacerable- that there is great danger of the pins or stitches cutting out. I woifid there- fore not advise its performance then. It is scarcely necessary to observe that, as union by the first intention is aimed at, the operation should not be undertaken unless the health be good ; and certainly not if the child, at whatever age, have but recently recovered from measles, scarlet fever, or other infantile disease. Operation for Hare-lip.—In the treatment of hare-lip, there are three main objects to be kept in view: 1. The procuring of Union by the Direct Adhesion of the cut edges of the fissure ; 2. The Prevention, as far ^ po^ib e, of Deformity during the process of union; and, 3. The Avoidance of all Trac- tion on the line of incision that may interfere with these results. These principles of treatment are earned out by paring the edges o fissure freely, bringing them together by means of the twisted or i^emip e suture, and taking off’ all tension by means of strips of p astci an0 FEE ATI ON FOE SINGLE IIAEE-LIP. 503 compressor. But the details of the treatment vary so much, according as the fissure is sino-le or double, or complicated by more or less projection of the intermaxillary portions, that the steps of each operation require to be separately Single Hare-lip.—The operation for single hare-lip is performed in the following way. The child having been well pinned in a jack-towel that swatheslt tightly, the Surgeon, sitting down, places his feet on a stool so as to raise them; and, covering his knees with a piece of tarpaulin, holds the child, s head firmly between them. The bleeding from the coronary artery of the hp may be arrested, either by an assistant or the Suigeon grasping the lip between his forefinger and thumb, 01 by compressing the lip with the little contrivance heie figiu-ed, which consists of an ordinary ring-forceps con- verted into a compressor by having a vulcanised India- rubber ring slipped over the handles. This little con- trii'ance will be found to be invaluable in many opera- tions about the face and jaws. The lower this ring is drami doivn, the tighter will the forceps grip. The Surgeon first freely divides the frmnum and all mem- branous connections between the angle of the cleft and the gum of the upper jaw, and then, putting the lip on the stretch by seizing the extreme edge of the cleft with a pair of artery-forceps or a tenaculum, he pares the edges of the cleft by transfixion with a narrow-bladed bistoury, or fine scalpel, from above dovnawards, first on one side, then on the other; taking care that the in- cisions unite neatly and cleanly above the upper angle of the fissure, which must be well cut out; and that they extend sufficiently far outwards to cut away the rounded portion of the pro- labium which forms the side of the base of the fissime. Care should be taken that enough is cut away; there is more danger usually of taking too little than too much. In single hare-lip, where the lips are very lax, the incisions may be straight; but if the gap be wide and the tissue deficient, or in double hare-lip, they should be somewhat concave inwards : in this way there is less likelihood of an unseemly noteh being left (Fig. 608). Fine hare-lip pins, made of soft iron wire, with steel points, should then be deeply introduced through the lip from one side of the fissure to the other. The pins should be entered at about a quarter of an inch from the pared edge on one side, and brought out at a con-esponding point on the other; care being taken that, though they are passed deeply, the mucous membrane is not trans- fixed : if it be, it will be doubled into the wound, and thus interfere vdth. union. Two pins are usually required; if the child be some years old, and the fissure very long, three may be used. The lower pin should be introduced first underneath or through the cut labial artery, in such a way that its pressure may stop the bleeding from this vessel, which is often rather fr’ee : in passing this pin, gi’eat care should bo taken to bring the opposite sides of the fissure well into contact, so as to be on a level below, that no irregularity may be left Fig. G05.—Elastic Com- pressor applied over Coronary Artery.S°4 PLASTIC SURGERY OF THE FACE AND MOUTH. in the prolabium. The twisted suture is then applied in the usual way (Fig. (>0G), first round the lower pin, and then round the upper one (separate threads, however, being used for each); and lastly, the two are united by a few cross turns, so as to press down and support the whole length of the fissure (Fig. GOT). In Fig. 600.—Axiplication of Twisted Suture. Fig. C07.— A])iilieatioii of Pius and Sutures in Hare-lii). applying the twisted suture the Surgeon must be careful, whilst drawing the edges closely into apposition, not to apply the threads too tightly, lest sloughing result; and in crossing them from one pin to the other, gveat caution must be used not to draw the two pins together horizontally, lest puckering of the line of union take place. The pins are then cut short, the whole is coated with a layer of collodion, and a piece of plaster is put under the ends of the pins to prevent excoriation of the skin. In addition to the pins and twisted sutm-e, I invariably introduce one point of interrupted suture through the mucous mem- brane of the lower part of the fissure, just inside the mouth ; and I look upon this as of great consequence in order to prevent the notching, which is other- wise very apt to occur, in consequence of that portion of the incision between the lower pin and the edge of the lip being kept open by the child in sucking, or protruding its tongue against it. At- the end of fi’om 72 to 9G hours, according to the age of the child, the pin should be withdrawn, or it may be remo\’ed by pushing it through the lip by a gentle rotatory movement, in such a Avay that the cut end does not tear or lacerate the aperture in the lip. The threads, matted together vdth exudation and a little blood, form a good crust. which may be left on for two or three days longer, and then allowed to separate of itself; the less any crusts that form over the line of incision are interfered with, the better will usually be the result. The lip may, if thought desirable, be supported by a strip of adhesive plaster, which should, indeed, be continued for about a fortnight after the operation, so as to prevent stretching of the cicatrix and notching of its loAver part. The point of interrupted suture may be left in fqr about four days. It sometimes, though rarely, happens in single hare-lip that the intermaxillary portion is so large and projecting, that there is difficulty in bringing the lateral segments together over it. Should this be the case, the better plan is to notch it at its alveolar border on the side that is not fissured, and then to break it back so as to remoAC all projection. If the fissure be Avide, and the child restless, so that there is danger of the parts being diagged upon duiiiij, its screaming or crying, it is a very good plan to upply the sjuing chee' com _ Fig. 60S.—Hare-lip; Spring CUcck-comprcssor.505 OPERATION FOR DOUBLE IIARE-LIR. Indeed, Its use pressor, invented by Hainsby, here represented slaek (Fig. G08). whenever obtainable, this excellent contrivance should be employed, fidds greatly to the success of the operation. Double Hare-lip.—The operation for double hare-lip is performed on the same inlnciple as that for the single form of the disease, viz., of procuring union by adhesion between the o])posite smTaces. The difference in the operations consists chiefly in dealing with the inter- jnediate portion of the lip and alveolus (Fig. 609). The management of the intermaxillary process must vary according to its size and degree of pro- jection. If it be small and rudimentary, or fixed to the tip of the nose, as in Fig. 610, it should be cut off with bone-nippers, as it would prevent the lateral segments from coming into proper appo- sition. Most commonly, when this is done, there is free and even dangerous bleeding from a dental nrtery deep in the bone, which may require to be touched with a red-hot needle or A^ire before the hajmorrhage from it Avill cease. If the central intermaxillary portion be large and iDrojecting, it may be bent or broken back by strong forceps covered Avith vulcanised India-rubber. Fergusson has, however, pointed out that if this be done the incisor teeth contained in the intermaxillary por- /ion wiU, if they develope at aU, project backAvards into the roof of the mouth, as the bone is not pushed into its normal situation, but rather rotated on its transverse axis, the slender neck attaching it to the vomer being bent upon itself. He is of opinion therefore that in all cases it is better to remove the bone than to attempt to force or bend it into a new position. If it be large and not projecting, the soft parts should be well pared on each side, and transfixed by the hai-e-hp pins, and thus be rig. 009. — Operation for Double Hiirc-lip.

AVhen it is left i awkwardly situated, as in It IS left, though the union may not appear quite so perfect5o6 PLASTIG surgery OF THE FACE AND MOUTH. and iniiform as it would if the lateral halves liad been directly united, yet eventually the case will turn out better ; the central portion becoming deve- loped, and forming the natural mesial projection of the lip, which is lost when the lateral halves are directly united. Butcher has invented some very simple and ingenious forceps for the partial section and bending back of the inter- maxillary process. In some of these cases great nicety is required in planning the incisions, and in the introduction of the sutures. The central portion is most advantageously pared in a somewhat concave manner, so that the freshly cut edges of the lateral halves are received into and more accurately fitted upon it. Should, as often happens in single as well as in double hare-lip, one of the lateral segments be tied down to the gum and alveolus by a doubling of mucous membrane, this must be freely divided, and the portion of lip, with perhaps the corresponding ala of the nose, freely dissected up from the osseous structimes, so as to admit of its being moved forwards without too much traction being put upon it. In those cases in which the intermaxillary portion is projecting, and attached to and fused with the cohmma of the nose, as in Figs. 610 and 611, I have performed the following operation with great success. 1. The triangular flap of skin covering the intermaxillary portion is dis- sected up as thick as possible. 2. The intermaxillaiy process is then cut away at its root, which is small and pedunculated, with a pair of scissors. 3. The edges of the lateral fissures are then pared in the usual way. 4. The free lower margins of the pared edges are brought together by one hare-lip pin and twisted suture. 5. The leaf-shaped flap is then laid dowm in the triangular hollow left above the pin, and retained there by one or two points of silver suture on each side, the gap being thus completely filled up by it. Treatment by Simple Suture.—During several years I was in the habit of treating hare-lip of all kinds, double as well as single, with the simple interrupted sutm’e alone, without using any pins. I have in this way treated most successfully many cases in children, whose ages have varied from a few days to four years, with most satisfactory residts, and with less marking of the lip than I have ever seen attend union by means of the twisted suture. I prefer the simple to the twisted suture as being equally safe, more simple, and followed by less scarring of the lip, provided the case be not too com- plicated, nor associated Avith very Avide fissure in the palate, or AAuth great projection of the intermaxillary bones. In these circumstances, the pins should be preferred. AVhen the fissure is single, the edges, having been pared in the usual way, should be brought together by tAvo points of suture ; the first passed deeply near the free edge, and in such a way as to compress the cut coronary artery ; j the other nearer the nasal angle. These sutures should be of thick well- 'I waxed dentist’s twist that AviU not cut out too readily, or, Avhat is better, of silver Avire. A point of fine inteiTupted suture should then be inserted through , the mucous membrane inside the lip. The tip may then be supported by tAvo narroAV strips of plaster, one placed between the sutures, the other between the upper suture and the nose. On the third day the upper suture s ou i be taken out, but the lower one may be left in for a day or two long-er, ay en ; it and the one through the mucous membrane may be removed togetnei.5°7 CIIEILOPLASTY. unless the latter hare already cut its way out. If silver wire sutures he used, they may be left in for six or seven days without producing irritation. The lip must then be supported for a few days wdth a strip of plaster. In the case of double hare-lip the same plan is to be adopted, fii'st on one side, then on the other 3 but here, as the gaps are wider, and the tension, more particularly when the intennaxillary prominence is very projecting, is apt to. be considerable, it is necessary to support the cheeks, and thus to prevent, undue traction on the stitches, by means of the check-compressor (Fig. C07). In this way all risk of the stitches cutting out before union is completed is avoided ; an excellent and solid union will speedily bo obtained even im cases of double hare-lip, with some intermaxillary projection and fissured, palate. The operation occasionally fails. The probability of the occunence of such an untoward event is, however, gxeatly diminished by the use of the cheek- compressor. It may, however, happen either in consequence of the child s- health being in an unsatisfactory state, so as to prevent union by the first intention; or in consequence of the pins having been withdrawn too early,, before seciu’e cohesion has been effected. In such circumstances as these, an attempt might be made to unite the granulating edges by the re-introduc- tion of the pins or sutures, and by firmly fixing the lip by means of the cheek- compressor. Such- attempts, however, rarely succeed ; should they not do so, it will usually be found most prudent to wait at least a month before taking any further steps, and then to pare the edges afresh and repeat the original operation. CoxGENiTAL Transverse Fissures op the Cheeks, extending from the angle of the mouth to the anterior border of the masseter or up towards the malar bone, are occasionally met with, and have been specially described by Klein and Kicati. In these malformations, which are of extremely rare occurrence, the ear on the affected side is imperfectly developed. As has- been observed by Fergusson, the tragus is detached from the auricle, and is- fixed to the cheek, where it forms a small lobulated appendage. This external ear generally is malformed, the helix being twisted and curled inwards. These malformations require to be treated on exactly the same principles, and with the same attention to details, as hare-hp ; union between the pared edges being effected by means of hare-hp pins and the twisted suture. Cheiloplasty.—Simple plastic operations are commonly practised on the lower lip for the removal of cancroid disease, by cutting out a V”Shaped piece of the lip, including the whole diseased structure, and then bringing together the opposite sides of the incision by hare-lip pins. These operations have alieady been described and figured at p. 400, Vol. II. We shall consider here those cases in which it becomes necessary to repair more or less extensive loss of substance in the labial structures. The restoration of a portion of the lip that has been destroyed by accident or disease, is not so readily effected as that of the nose ; yet a good deal may be done to remove the defoiTuity. The plan originally introduced by Chopart consists, when it is the lower lip that is efomed, in can-ying an incision from behind the lower jaw down to the hyoid bone, so^ that a square flap may result, which is detached from above downwards. This flap is then brought up, and fixed to the pared edges of the5o8 plastic surgery OF THE FACE AND MOUTH. remaining portion of the lijiby points of suture ; the head being kept properly inclined, in order to prc’s^ciit undue tension. After sufficient union has taken place to preserve the vitality of the flap, its lower attachment may be divided. I’he flaj) should, if possible, not be twisted, though it is not always practicable to avoid this. This operation is not usually very satisfactory in its results, as the new flap is apt to become cedematous and inverted at the edge, or the flow •of saliva may interfere with proper union. In those cases in Avhich the greater portion of the lower lip has been excised for cancerous disease affecting its upper mai-gin, the most successful procedure for the restoration of the deformity ■consists in a modification of the plan recommended by Serres ; and from this I have derived excellent results, as in the case which is here represented (Fig. The object of the operation is to raise the lower lip to a level Avith the Fig. C12.—Lines of lueision in Clieiloi)lasty. Fig. G13.—Incisions .mu Sutures in ClieiloiiUisty. incisor teeth. An incision, about three-quarters of an inch in length, is made directly outwards from the angle of the mouth, on each side, into the cheek ; from the extremity of this, a cut is carried obliquely downwards on to the upper margin of the lower lip, so as to excise the included triangular piece ; the lower lip is then dissected away from the jaw, from the inside of the mouth, and a yshaped piece is taken out of its centre. By means of a hare- lip pin on each side, and a point of suture, the incisions in the angle of the mouth are brought accm-ately together ; and in the same way the vertical one, in the centre, is united (Fig. 613). In this way the whole of the lower lip is raised, and brought more forwards. If care have been taken m removing the cancer from the edge of the h’lj, to leave the mucous membrane rather long (which may ahvays be done, as the skin is affected to a gi’eater extent than it), a good prolabium may be formed, and the restoration effected AAith but little deformity. Care must be taken to prevent unffin from occm'ring between the inside of the loAver lip and the gum, by the interposition of a strip of oiled lint. Buchanan, of Glasgow, as far back as 1811, published an account of a method for restoring the lower hp Avhen affected by extensive cancerous ■ disease, Avhich leaves most satisfactory results. The accompanying figures illustrate the kind of case in which Buchanan’s operation is aiiplicable, the lines of incision required, and the appearance presented by the chin and lip after the disease has been removed, and the flaps brought into proper ■apposition. The steps of the operation are simple, and the result is excellent. ^ ^ The diseased part of the loAver lijj is first remoA’ed by an elliptical incision (Fig. 61-1, A B a).

Syme recommended a somewhat different mode of operating. Instead of making the incisions c D, he carried those marked B c onwards for some distance in a direction ciu’ving downwards and outwards, so that they terminated below the angles of the jaw. The flaps so formed were raised and united in the middle line, as in Buchanan’s operation, the A-shaped portion of skin above the chin serving to maintain them in position and prevent their sliding downwards. The long curved incisions enabled this to be done by merely stretching the convex edges of the flaps, -without sufficiently displacing them to prevent their readily meeting the concave edges of intervening skin, and beiug united to them by sutures. No surface ■was therefore left to granulate, and the whole wound has healed by the first intention. PLASTIC STJRGBKT OF THE PALATE. Various degi-ees of congenital deformity may occui- in the palate and uvula: thus the uvula alone may be bifid, or the cleft may extend through the greater part of the whole of the soft palate ; or the hard palate may be di-vided as well (Fig. 61?); and, lastly, the separation may extend forwards to the integuments of the face, producing single or doiflflo hare-lip (Fig. 604). The soft palate and uvula arc not unfrequently cleft without tlie hard palate being divided ; and, in some ■v^ery rare cases, the lip and the hard palate fissured without the soft one being cleft. Ihese malformations necessarily give rise to j^cat inconvenience, by interfering with deglu- tition, and rendering speech nasal and imperfect. bit.—rissuio of iinrd mui soft During the swallowing of fluids, there is a tendency to regurgitation through the nose, though this is occasionally510 PLASTIC SURGERY OF THE FACE AND MOUTH. in-cvented by the approximation of the edges of the fissure in the soft Until a few years ago, the operation was always deferred until the patient had attained the age to understand the necessity of remaining quiet during the proceeding, and was able to control his movements, as success depended^n a great measm-e upon his remaining perfectly tranquil and steady durino- the necessary manipulations, which are of a tedious and protracted character Tand upon his assisting the Surgeon by opening his mouth, and not struo-o-lin^ during the introduction of instruments. Chloroform was never adminis°tered from the fear that suflPocation might be caused by the blood from the operation, which is always abundant, entering the air-passages. In 1869, however, Thomas Smith, of St. Bartholomew s Hospital, demonstrated that with proper <;ai’e amesthetics may be safely administered, and at the same time he invented a most ingenious gag, by means of which the patient’s mouth can be kept ■widely open without the Surgeon being interfered with either by the hands of assistants or the instrument itself. By the help of this gag, and the adminis- tiation of chlorofoim, the ojperation can now be performed at any a^e * but as the bleeding is always very free, it is advisable not to attempt it’in too young childi*en. At the age of tkree it may be safely undertaken, and the advantage of having it done before the child has learned to speak is very great. Staphyloraphy.—The operation for the cime of a cleft in the soft palate may be said to have been introduced by Ptoux ; for although several attempts at the cure of this deformity had been made by Surgeons before his time, yet he was the first to establish Staphyloraphy as a distinct operation. Many modifications of Eoux’s plan have been practised by Von Griife, Warren, Dieffenbach, Liston, and others, in order to render it more easy of execution, and certain in its results, and especially by making incisions through the palate so as to take off the traction on the sutures ; but to Fergusson is due the great merit of introducing a new principle of treatment in the operation—viz., the application of myotomy to it, thus paralysing the movements of the muscles of the palate. Fergusson found that the great cause of failure in these operations was the mobility of the parts, and the traction exercised by the muscles, principally the levator palati and the palato-pharyngeus, on the line of union ; in order to ob-Uate this, he conceived the happy idea of dividing these muscles. Before Fergusson laid dovm the principles of this operation, it is true that various cuts had been made in the palate by different Sm’geons, with the ^dew of taking off the tension after the sutures were tied. Thus Dieffenbach, Pancoast, Liston, and Sedillot, all recommend that the traction on the stitches should be lessened by longitudinal cr transverse incisions across the velum pendulum palati. Mettauer practised several small incisions for this puipose ; and Mason Warren divided the anterior pillar of the fauces and its attachments to the posterior pillar, coming nearer than any previous operator to Fergusson’s method. These operations, however, were done almost at hap-hazard, and in an empirical Avay, without the recognition of any distinct principle being involved in them. Operation.—The patient is placed in the recumbent position, the Surgeon standing on his right side. The gag is then inserted, and chlorofoimF£liGUSSOiTS OPERATION FOR STAPIIYLORAPHY. 511 Fig. 018.—Wood’s Modification of Sraitli’s Gag. administered or if the patient be nervous tlic gag may bo inserted when tidmi isteie , 1 represented in the accompanying draw- irpcis tavoutod by Wood. It can taadjulicd to fit any patient by more or less widely scpar.at.ug the two '“‘‘111*6 operation as performed by Fergusson, there are folir distinct stag® 1. The miLles of the palate are divided; by passing a ciuwed lancet-ended kn fe thromdi the fissure behind the velum, midway between its attachment to the hard palate and the free margin, and about half-way between the velum and the end of the Eustachian tube. By cutting deeply with the point of the knife in this situation, the levator palati is di^dded. The uvula is then seized and drawn forwards, so as to put the posterior pillar ■of the fauces on the stretch, which is to be snipped across, so as to divide the palato-phai'yngeus. The anterior pillar, the palato-glossus, may then be notched in a similar way. 2. The next step in the operation consists in paring the edges gf the fissure from above doivnwards, by means of a shai'p-pointed bistomy. This is best done by seizing the lower ■end of the uvula, putting it on the stretch, and cutting first on one side .and then on the other, leaving the angle of union to be afterwards removed. The patient should then be allowed to remain quiet, and to gargle the mouth with cold water or to suck ice, so as to stop the bleeding; or, if under chloroform, a piece of ice fixed in a holder may be applied to the wound to check the hiemorrhage, while the fauces are frequently cleared of blood and mucus by means of sponges on sponge-holders. 3. When the bleeding is arrested, the Sm’geon proceeds to the next step, that of iatroducing the sutures; this may be done by means of a iiEevus-needle, armed with a moderate-sized thread, being passed from below upwards on the left side of the fissure, abouc a quarter of an inch from the margin ; the thread should now be seized with forceps, and one end of it pulled forwards through the fissui'e. This may again be threaded in the needle, and passed through the opposite side of the fissm’e from behind forwards through the right side ; as the point of the needle appears, the thread should agaui be seized, and the needle at the same time withdrawn ; the suture is then tied by means of the Siu'geon’s knot; and in this w^y, according to the extent of the fissure, from two to fom* sutures may be passed and tied lightly, and the knots cut close. An important im- provement in this method of passing the sutures is now very generally adopted. It consists in passing a single sutui-e through the left side of the cleft from before backwards in the usual way. A needle, having an eye at its point, I and thi’oaded with a loop instead of a single thread, is now passed through the right side of the cleft, the loop drawn through, and the needle removed. The •single suture is then slipped through the loop. This is then withdrawn, ■carrying with it through both sides of the cleft the single ligature. In this512 PLASTIC SUIlGEliY OF THE FACE AND MOUTH. way the sntui-es, being passed on both sides from before baekwards, can be inserted more evenly, and Avitlr less cbance of pnekering when knotted. In tying the knots, groat earc should be taken that no nndne traction be exercised npon the parts ; in fact, the nse of the sutures is not to draw, but simply to hold, the parts togethoi-; the division of the muscles has caused these to be relaxed, so that they hang down loosely, and merely require to be held in apposition by the sutm-es. The patient must next be put to bod, and every care taken to avoid any movement of the palate. He should be restricted to fluid but nourishing food for a few days, and should be directed to swallow this with as little effort as possible, and indeed should not be allowed anything solid until complete union has taken place. All coughing, spitting, or swallow- ing of the saliva should be interdicted 4. The stitches should, he left in for several days; and, indeed, need not be disturbed so long as they produce no irritation. They usually require removal by the eighth or tenth day, but occasionally may be left with advantage for some time longer, until they excite irritation, or mitil union is perfect ; they should then be cut across with scissors and di’aAvn out, the upper one first, the middle next, and the lower one last. Shoidd there be any aperture left in the palate, where union has not taken place, this may be closed by touching it with a point of nitrate of silver. The voice in these cases does not usually at once recover its natural tone after the operation, although in some cases it may. The nasal or “ Punch- like” voice that is often left after operations, appears to arise from two causes. The first is the mere habit of faulty articulation, and this can be corrected by careful instruction in elocution. The second, which is much more difficult to deal with, arises from a mechanical condition, and is. dependent on the contraction upwards of the palate along the line of the cicatrix, so that the velum becomes unable to shut off the posterior nares from the pharynx. Mason has proposed to remedy this condition by dividing the soft palate perpendicularly on each side, so as to leave a square and mobile central fiap. In dividing the levator palati, Pollock adopts a different practice from that Fig. 019. 020. l'‘g. 021. Sddillot's Orcratiou for Staiiliylorapliy. of Fergusson.

This method of dividing the levator palati, which is analogous to the plan employed and depicted by SddiUot (Figs. 019, G20, G21), appeam to be more simple and easy of execution than the division of the muscles of the velum from behind. The gap that is left closes without difficulty by gnmulatiou, and seems still more to take off tension from the parts. Uranoplasty. Fissures of the Hard Palate are usually closed by means of “ obturators ” made of gold, Amlcanised India-rubber, or ivory. To ‘VYarren, of Boston, is undoubtedly due the merit of having been the first to close these fissures by a surgical operation. This he did by dissecting the soft tissues fi-om the palatal arch between the margin of the cleft and the edge of the gum, and then uniting them in the middle line by means of stitches in the same way as in fissured soft palate. This operation was first brought before the Profession in this country by Avery and subsequently by Pollock, who have invented some very ingenious instruments for its proper performance. The operation is performed in the following way. An incision having been made along the edge of the cleft, at the junction of the nasal and palatal mucous membranes, the soft covering of the hard palate is carefully dissected or scraped down off the bones by means of curved knives, great care being taken that the mucous membrane and its subjacent fibro-cellular tissue, which varies great in thickness in different cases, be not perforated. Langenbeck has particularly recommended that the periosteum be detached mth the fibro-mucous tissue ; so that the flaps brought down may not only be thicker and stronger than they otherwise might be, but also that they may eventually throw out bone and thus close the gap by a firm solid deposit. In doing this, Langenbeck uses a blunt instrument in preference to a sharp angular one, and takes especial care to avoid the division of the attachments of the soft covering of the hard palate, at those points, anteriorly and posteriorly, where the blood-vessels and nerves enter. lYhen these structures have been well loosened on each side, the covering of the palate will be found to hang down as a curtain fr’om the vault of the mouth— the two parts coming into apposition along the mesial line, or possibly over- lapping. The edges, being then smoothly pared, are brought into apposition by means of a few points of suture, thread or wire, the latter preferable, intro- duced in the ordinary way and without any dragging. On this point great care is necessary. The knots ha^’ing been tied, the patient is confined to bed for several days, and allowed an abundant, but fluid or pulpy diet. Union, if it take place, will usually be found to be perfect at the end of a week. bir William Fergusson, not having found the operation above described as siiccessfal as was at first hoped, was led to devise a different method, which in his hands has proved most satisfactoiy. Instead of raising the soft structures of the hard palate from the bone, he makes an incision on each side of the fissure, and then dividing the bone longitudinaUy with a chisel, forces the two edges into contact. The operation is thus performed. The patient being under the influence of chloroform, and Smith’s or Wood’s gag having been introduced the edges of the fissure in the hard palate arc pared. An incision is then made down to the bone on each side, a quarter of an inch from the margin of the fissurc^andparallel to it. The chisel is then carefully pushed upwards through L li514 PLASTIC SURGERY OF THE FACE AND MOUTH. the bone into the cavity of the nose. By a slight lateral movement of the chisel, the two portions can now be readily made to meet in the middle line; stitches may then be passed through the opening on each side ; the lateral gaps close afterwards by gTanulation, As Sir William Fergusson found that the stitches when passed through the two lateral Avounds were apt to slip, in his later opera- tions he drilled the palate on each side of the fissure in one or more places, and passed the sutures through the drill-holes before applying the chisel; and, still more lately, he has in some cases abandoned sutures altogether, and kept the two sides of the fissure in contact by introducing plugs of lint into the lateral wounds. In a few cases slight necrosis has occuiTed after this operation, but in none has there been any difficulty in closing the two lateral gaps formed by the chisel. In order to be successful, a careful selection of cases to be operated on must be made. Fergusson considers that about one-half of the fissures of the hard palate admit of operation. There is a difference of practice amongst Simgeons as to the closiu’e of the gap in the soft palate at the same time as the one in the hard palate, or at a subsequent period. Pollock prefers a delay in the operation until the cleft in the hard palate is closed. Annandale has, however, operated successfully by closing the fissure in both palates at one sitting; and perhaps the wisest course to adopt is to close as much of both as the patient can bear at one time, and to leave the remainder of the operation to be completed at another oiAportimity. If it be determined to undertake the closure of the hard and soft palates in two distinct operations, Fergusson prefers to do the soft palate first, leaving the hard till a later time. Perforation of the Hard Palate.—Perforations of the hard palate, con- sequent on necrosis of the bones, the result of syphihs or injury, are not amenable to surgical treatment. In such cases, a well fitting obtm-ator iviU most effec- tually remedy the inconvenience. Tumours of the Pat,ate.—Tumours of various kinds may arise in the hard or soft palate. Amongst the most important are Enchondroma, Fibroma, and Sarcoma of the hard palate, and Adenoma of the soft palate. These last are, perhaps, the most frequent. They are occasionally found also in the hard palate. They are hard, smooth, painless, and, being encapsuled, are readily shelled out from a single incision. Syphilitic gummata and cancer may also occur in this region. The diagnosis must be made and the treatment con- ducted on general principles.515 GLOSSITIS. CHAPTER LIX. —<— DISEASES OF THE MOUTH AHD THROAT. DISEASES OF THE TONGUE. To^’GUE-TIE.—Infants and even adults are said to be tongue-tied, when the frienum bnguje is shorter than usual, causing the end of the tongue to be shghtly bifid, depressed, and fixed, so that it cannot be protruded beyond the incisors. If this malformation be considerable, suckling and distinct articula- tion may be interfered with; and then division of the fold becomes necessary, which may readily be done by snipping it across with a pair of round-ended scissors. In this operation, the risk of wounding the ranine arteries, that is sometimes spoken of, may be avoided by keeping the point of the scissors downwards towards the fioor of the mouth. Hypeetbophy AjYd Peolapsus of the Tongue has occasionally been met with, either as a congenital or an acquired condition ; it has been described by Lassus and Crosse as consisting either in want of power in the retractor muscles, or in hyper- '■ trophy of the organ (Fig. 622). In this condi- tion, the tongue lolls out of the mouth, is greatly swollen, of a pmplish colour, but somewhat dry, with constant dribbhng of sahva. If the swell- ing have existed for a long time, it may give rise to deformity of the teeth, and of the alveolus of the lower jaw, which is pushed forwards. In the Treatment of this affection, little need be done unless it be excessive and permanent, when excision of a portion of the tongue by the ecraseur may be required. Glossitis is a rare affection, more particu- larly when it occurs idiopathically; most commonly it results from immoderate and injudieious salivation. In this disease the tongue is gi-eatly infiltrated with serum and blood, becoming immensely swollen, so as to hang out of the mouth with profrise discharge of saliva and inability on the part of the patient perhaps a threatening of suffocation. ihe Treatment is as simple as it is efficient; it consists in making a loim- flifid« tT ^mediate rehef by the escape of blood and infiltrLed fluids. I have seen a patient, who was nearly suffocated by the immense size o1 atrE Sl^ardt^^^^ — Fig. 622.—Great Hy}jertropliy of Tongue. L L 2Si6 DISEASES OF THE MOUTH AND THROAT. Absoess of the Tongue, though rare, occasionally occurs. I have seen several instances of it. The abscess forms a small deeply seated elastic but firm tumour, which sometimes feels slightly movable and presents no super- ficial discoloration. A boy was once brought to me with an elastic tumour of slow growth, and of about the size of a small plum, situated deeply in the centre of the tongue ; on puncturing it, about half an ounce of healthy pus was let out, after which the cyst speedily closed. N^vus and Aneurism by Anastomosis are but rarely seen in the tongue, and when met with would require to be treated on the same principles that guide ns in the management of the disease elsewhere. A very remarkable instance of an erectile tumour of naivoid character affecting the tongue came under my care, in which the whole of the free extremity of the organ was im- plicated in the morbid growth, presenting a thin club-shaped end, which pro- truded between the teeth and lips of the patient, a girl about three years old. In this case Image, of Bury St. Edmunds, had very judiciously aiTested the activity of the disease, and had produced consolidation of the mass, by the introduction of setons, which were worn for some months ; and, when the child subsequently came under my care, the chief inconvenience that existed resulted from interference with speech, and the deformity occasioned by the hypertrophied and elongated organ (Fig. 342, p. 942, vol. I.) By means of the dcraseur I removed all the redundant tissues, and so reduced the tongue to its normal length and breadth. Morbid Changes of the Epithelium of the tongue sometimes occur; amongst the most remarkable of these is Psoriasis. In this affection the tongue is indurated, shrivelled, and dry, having cracks upon its surface, with patches of a dead white colour, and irregular in shape, varying in size from that of a split-pea to an inch in diameter ; this condition exactly resembling- psoriasis of the palms of the hands, may occur with or without scaly disease of the general integument. I have seen it in both conditions, and have always found it a most difficult affection to treat. The preparations of arsenic, with Plummer’s piU and sarsaparilla, have, however, appeared to afford the best results. In some instances it is evidently of syphilitic origin : and then it re- quires to be treated on the general principles that guide us in the management of the constitutional forms of that disease. The surface of the tongue occasionally assumes a Glazed and Warty Character, as if covered with a layer of boiled sago ; the mucous membrane being oedematous, elevated and papillated, but at the same time glassy and semi-transparent, and without induration. This condition, which usually aiises from syphilis, requires the constitutional treatment of that disease. A Hard Warty Condition of the Mucous Membrane covering the end or side of the tongue is occasionally met with, giving rise sometimes to so i much interference ivith speech, as to require removal either by the scissors or ecraseur. This has been likened by some to Ichthyosis, and appeai-s to consist of an elongation of the papillm with a dense horny epithelial covering to them. Both it and the disease which I have described as psoriasis are liable to degenerate into epithelioma of the organ, and they thus acquire a serious and prospective importance. Fissures or Cracks not imcommonly appear upon the side of the tongu ,CANCER OF THE TONGUE. 517 usually opposite the molar teeth, sometimes dependeut on in'itation of stumps, hut not unft-eciuently on dyspepsia. These craeks may in some depraved states of the constitution extend rapidly, eroding away a considerable portion of the side of the organ in a short time, so as to leave a large and deep sloughy cavity with much dusky inflammation around it, but without any induration of the base or sides, with great fetor of the breath, and a copious discharge of saliva, which trickles out of the corners of the mouth ; the patient being usually destroyed in a few months, by the irritation of the disease, the inability to take food, and the supervention of htemorrhage. Treatment—disease, which is a combination of sloughing and ulcera- tion, possibly in some cases malignant, is best treated in the early stages by the use of chlorinated gargles, Avith a moderately anti-inflammatory regimen. As it advances, the internal administration of arsenic is useful in some cases, with the application of the balsam of Peru, either pmre or diluted with the yolk of egg, and the employment of gargles composed of the chlorides and the tincture of myrrh. Syphilitic G-umha is not unfrequently met with in the tongue, as one of the adi'anced symptoms of constitutional syphUis, forming an indurated irre- gularly cu’cumscribed mass, of a round shape, situated deeply in the substance of the organ, or towards the centre of the tip. The surface covering the gumma is of a dusky red or coppery colour ; it rarely runs on to ulceration, though rhagades and fissures occasionally form around it; there is no fetid discharge, and no destruction of the organ. The Treatment consists in the administration of small doses of bichloride of merciuy in sarsaparilla, under which the gumma Avill rapidly disappear. Excysted ahd Fibeous Tumoues, requiring extirpation, are sometimes situated in the centre of the tongue, towards its mesial line. In such cases they may readily be removed by drawing the tongue forwards by means of a hook or piece of whipcord passed thi-ough its tip, and then dissecting out the morbid growth. Any bleeding that occiu's may be arrested by passing a sutm-e or tivo by means of a curved or cork-screw needle across the gap in the com’se of the diA-ided A'cssels, and thus closing the aperture at the same time that the vessels are compressed. Cahcee oe the Tongue.—Epithelioma is the form of cancer that com- monly affects the tongue. It almost ahvays commences on the edge, usuaUy at the middle third, extending back to the anterior pillar of the ffiuces. It may occur at the tip, or even on the dorsum of the tongue. Scinkus is rare. I have, however, seen it in several instances, and after death sciiThus tubercles haA^e been found in the hver, lungs, and heart. Scin-hus commonly begins as a hai-d solid mass in the body of the organ. I ave only seen encephaloid Avhen the disease Avas recurrent, and then in the floor of the mouth. _ Cancer of the tongue, Avhatever form it assumes, most usuaUy occurs in muviduals between the ages of forty and sixty. It is more frequent in men lan in women. It may doA^elope Avithout any evident cause in persons Avho are otherwise perfectly healthy, whose teeth are sound, and in Avhom there has been no pre-existing disease of the tongue. But most commonly it occurs in consequence of a local imtation, as from the abrasion produced and kept np5i8 diseases of THE MOUTH AND THROAT. by a broken tooth. Or it may gradually dcvelopc in the site of an old syphilitic crack or unhealed fissure. In some instances I have seen it preceded for some years by chronic thickening, apparently of a squamous character, of the mucous membrane of the tongue, which slowly hardens, ulcerates, and at length be- comes epitheliomatous at one part. Most generally, the posterior lateral aspect of the tongue is the one thus affected. If a tubercle or warty growth appear, this is usually flat, indurated, and of a purphsh-red colour, gradually running into ulceration ; if a fissure, this from the commencement has an indurated base, a foul simface, and a callous edge. As the ulceration extends, a chasm with ragged sides, and a sloughy surface that cannot be cleansed, gradually form over a widely indm’ated base ; there are great fetor of the breath, and profuse sahvation ; and, as the disease progresses, implication of the mucous membrane and of the structures of the floor of the mouth, and of the glands under the jaw and in the neck, takes place. Sometimes the whole mass of the organ is infiltrated by cancerous deposit, becoming generally hard, nodulated, ulcerated, and in some parts covered by thin red cicatrices, and in others by foul putty-like accumulations of epithelium. The pain is very severe in most cases : every movement of the organ in articulation, mastication, or deglutition causes great suffering. The friction or compression by neighboming teeth, the profuse salivation, aU aggravate the patient’s distress in this most agonising- disease. The pain is not confined to the tongue, but runs through aU the branches of the fifth nen^e over the side and to the crown of the head, to the face and the ear. The lymphatic glands under the jaw usually become in- volved at an early period ; but in epithelioma the disease may exist for a year or two without their becoming imphcated. Cachexy at last supervenes, and the patient dies fr-om the conjoined effects of exhaustion, irritation, starva- tion, and poisoning of the system. In some instances, when the posterior part of the tongue is very deeply affected, copious and fatal arterial hmmon’hage may occur and destroy life, from the ulceration extending into the lingual artery. If cancer of the tongue be allowed to run its natural course uninfluenced by operation, nothing can exceed the misery of the patient’s death, brought about as it is by pain, hcemorrhage, and starvation. When the patient dies by reciu’- rence of the disease after removal, he has probably obtained some months of immunity from suffering ; and, as the fatal termination usually takes place by secondary deposits and constitutional cachexia, with A’isceral complications, it is far easier than when directly due to the diseased state of the tongue. Diagnosis.—The diagnosis of the various forms of disease of the tongue is important. The foul and sloughing ulcm' may be distinguished from all others by the rapidity of its progress, its eroding action, and the absence of all in- dm-ation at its base. Sgfhiliik ulceration, with an mdurated base, commonly closely resembles cancer of the tongue ; so closely, indeed, that it is only with great difficulty that the diagnosis can be effected. This, however, may generally be accomplished by observing that the syphilitic ulcer is elongated, ii-regular, does not rapidly extend, and is associated with mucous tubercles and other less dubious evidences of constitutional syphilis ; while the cancerous ulcer is ot a more circular shape, has hard and eroded edges, is moie paiii u , an Avith gTcater rapidity.

It is also of much moment to attend to the situation of the tumour ; the syphilitic gumma being almost invariably met with deeply in the substance of the organ, whilst the cancerous oi-owth is commonly seated at its edges or tip. It must, however, be re- membered that a tongue which has long been the seat of those morbid changes in the way of thickening and ulceration of its epithelium and mucous mem- brane, which ai-c the usual sequelm of syphilis, may at length become affected by true epithehoma at one side, usually towards the middle third—that a syphiloma may thus by local iiTitation be at length converted into an epi- thehoma, the tongue being simultaneously affected by both diseases. There are three conditions in cancer of the tongue that are of serious import, and that may, singly or in conjunction, lead to a fatal termination. 1. The pain not only weai’s out the patient by depriving him of rest and comfoit in life, but, being greatly aggravated by mastication and deglutition, causes him to avoid these acts, and hence leads to a process of gradual starvation, either by his abstaining fi’om food altogether, or taking a liquid and innutritions diet, because it is more easily swallowed than solid and more substantial meat. '2. The profuse salivation tends still further to exhaust the patient; and 3. The occun’ence of haemonhage, when the disease has eroded so deeply as to open up one of the larger branches or trunk of the hngual artery, may, by repeated recurrence or by sudden gush, destroy life. Treatment.—In the treatment of cancer of the tongue, medicines are utterly useless, except as palliatives of pain. No measures hold out any chance of recovery, or even of prolongation of life, except the complete removal of the diseased structure ; and this it is by no means easy to accomplish, as the cancerous infiltration often extends much farther than at first appears, passing deeply between the muscular fasciculi and planes, into the root of the tongue. In these deep cancerous affections there is usually great enlargement of the glands under the jaw with infiltration of the floor of the mouth and neigh- bouring soft parts to such an extent as to render it impossible to excise or in any other way remove the whole of the disease. There are two operations occasionally practised, having for their object to palliate the suffering or to retard the progress of the disease : viz., Division of the Gustatory Nerve, and Ligature of the Lingual Artery. Division of the Sensory Nerve of the Tongue.—Section of the gusta- tory branch of the fifth nerve was first proposed and practised by Hilton, •with the view of relieving the pain of the cancerous ulcer, retarding the pro- gress of the disease, lessening the profuse salivation, and enabling the Surgeon to apply ligatures for the removal of the cancer to a part that has been de- prived of all sensibility. This operation, which Moore repeated several times, and to which he specially drew the attention of the Profession, undoubtedly accomplishes the objects for which Hilton originally proposed and practised it; more especially so far as relief of pain and diminution of salivation arc520 DISEASES OF THE MOUTH AND THROAT. concerned. And it deserves to be considered as one of the most efficient modes of relief to the suffering produced by cancer of the tongue, in all cases in which an operation for the remo^^al of the disease is not desirable or practicable. The division of the gustatory nerve may bo done in two ways ; one origi- nally employed by Hilton, the other adopted by Moore. Both operations consist in dividing the gustatory nerve, in that part of its course which extends from its emergence between the internal pterygoid muscle and the jaw to the point where it enters the tongue. Opposite to the second molar tooth, the nerve lies under the mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth. There it can be easily reached by the division of the mucous membrane covering it, when it will be found close behind the sublingual gland. It may be raised by a blunt hook, seen, and divided. It was in this situation that Hilton practised its section. The advantage of this choice of place is, that the nerve can be seen and its division thus rendered certain. The disadvantages are, that the guides to the spot are not quite certain ; that the cut is apt to be obsciu-ed by haemorrhage ; and that, when the disease has extended to the floor of the mouth, the operation is inapplicable. Moore consequently recommended, and in flve cases practised, the section of the nerve ftu-ther back. The guide to it in this situation is the last molar tooth ; and a line drawn from the middle of the crovTi of the tooth to the angle of the jaw will cross the nerve in the exact place where it should be cut. The nerve lies about half an inch fr-om the tooth, between it and the anterior pillar of the fauces, parallel to but behind and below the bulging alveolar ridge, which can be felt in the lower jaw ascend- ing towards the thin coronoid process. By entering the point of a knife, therefore, into the mucous membrane of the mouth, three-quarters of an inch behind and below the last molar tooth, and cutting down to the bone, the nerve must be divided. Moore advises that for this purpose a ciu’ved bistomy be used, as the projection of the alveolar ridge would protect the nerve fr-om a straight blade. The good effect of the operation is instantaneous ; pain ceases in the tongue, ear, face, and head, and the flow of saliva is greatly dimi- nished : and the relief is continuous, for it does not appear that the nerve re-unites. ligature of the Lingual Artery may be requu-ed to restrain profuse haemorrhage from an ulcerated cancer of the tongue. This operation has also been practised with the view of starving the morbid growth and thus retarding its development. That it does so for a short period is undoubtedly the case, but that it does so permanently is a fallacy. This operation has been recom- mended for these purposes by Hemarquay, and has been performed in this country by Moore and C. Heath. The lingual artery may be exposed and tied in the following manner. The artery is reached with most certainty in the digastric triangle of the neck, where it hes beneath the hyo-glossus muscle. A curved incision from close to the symphysis menti, reaching down to the level of the hyoid bone, and prolonged upwards to near the angle of the jaw, Avill expose the lower bordei of the submaxillary gland. This being drawn up, the central tendon of the digastricus and posterior edge of the mylo-hyoideus will be brought into view, and the hypoglossal nerve with a vein will be seen lying horizontally upon the521 OPERATIONS ON THE TONGUE. hyo-"lossus muscle. These structures being draym up out of the way, the fibres of the hyo-glossus must be divided horizontally about a quarter of an inch above the hyoid bone, when the lingual artery will at once come into view (Fig. G23). Fig. 023.—Ligatm'e of Lingual Artery. Operations on the Tongue.—The operations that are practised on the tonguCjWhen it is affected by cancer consist in the removal of a portion of the organ only, or its complete extirpation from the hyoid bone, according to the situation of the disease and the extent to which the tongue is implicated. Unless the disease can be very fully and freely extirpated, it is better not to attempt any operation ; for in no organ is there a greater tendency to recurrence of cancer than in the tongue. No operation should be under- taken when the disease extends to the floor of the mouth, implicates the arches of the palate, or has largely infiltrated the submaxillary glands. Three methods of operation may be employed when a portion only of the tongue has to be removed—viz., by the ligature, the ecraseur, or the knife. "When the extirpation of the whole organ is decided upon, the ligatm’e is not applicable, and recourse must be had to the knife or the ecraseur. For the purposes of operation the tongue may be divided into three regions ; n'z., the anterior third, the central lateral portion, and the posterior part. When the tip or anterior third of the organ is cancerous, the hgatm-e or the knife may be equally used. The Ecraseur, though preferable to either, and applieable, is not needed. When the more central and lateral part is involved in disease, and requires removal, the knife, the ligature, and hcraseur, are all available. "When the posterior part is involved, so that the whole organ requires removal, the Surgeon should choose between the knife and the (icraseur. In all operations upon the tongue, throe precautions must be taken ; 1, to prevent the patient Irom biting it; 2, to expose it thoroughly ; and, 3, to keep it under control. The first object is attained by placing a screw-gag between52 2 DISEASES OF THE MOUTH AND THROAT. the teeth on the side opposite to the seat of operation ; the other two by draw- ing the cheek aside by means of an angular spatula, and by passing a strong double whipcord ligature through the tongue about an inch and a half from its Fig. G24.—Application of Screw-Gag, Cheek-Retractor, and Whipcord, in Operation on the Tongue. tip, and somewhat towards the side to be excised (Fig. 624). By this ligatm’e an assistant draws the organ out of the mouth. The light should be good for these operations, and the Surgeon should have trustworthy assistants. Excision, may readily and safely be done when the free anterior portion only of the tongue is diseased, or when it is only superficially affected at its side or back part. In using the knife in these situations, the diseased part of the tongue should be seized by a TulseUum or broad-bladed forceps, and then finely and widely excised by means of a scalpel curved on the flat. The heemoiThage is fine, often profuse. It wiU usually cease very rapidly, by keeping the tongue weU drawn forwards and ligaturing the artery that furnishes most blood—or the opposite sides of the cut may be drawn together with a w'hipcord ligatmn, and the bleeding surface compressed. Should the oozing continue rather abundantly, ice may be freely used. Strangulation of the diseased mass by means of the Ligature was formerly much more employed than at the present day, and is indeed now seldom adopted, on account of the pain that attends and the fetor that follows its use. If, how'ever, the Surgeon be single-handed or unprovided with trust- worthy assistants, or if htemorrhage be much to be avoided, this means may be employed. For the ^Durposes of this operation strong thick saddler’s w^hipcord is the best, as it does not readily cut through the soft and brittle tissue of the organ, w’hich will be the case if the small compressed cord usually sold by the instrument makers be used. There is little danger from htemorrhage in or after this opera- tion ; and the pain and subsecpient discomfort are usually much less than might be expected. The pain may be prevented by section of the gustatoiy nerve prior to the application of the ligature {see page 519). The ligature is passed by means of an ordinary ntevus-needle, or, what is often more convenient, a corkscrew needle curved on the side as well as to the point (Fig. 625). In many cases, the plan described for tying flat na^vi will be found the most convenient mode of passing the wdiipcord roimd the cancer of the tongue (Fig. 626). In whatever way the ligatures are applied, care should be taken to pass them through the healthy tissue of the organ wide o523 excision of the tongue. the disease and they should then be tied very tightly, so mass effectually.

Swelling of the tongue, followed by rather profuse salivation and fetor of the breatn^ attends this operation ; but the mass, if properly constricted, will slough awaj in a few days, lea’cing a large gap that readily fills by granulation.

Excision of the Whole or of a Large Portion of the Tongue.—This bold operation may be performed in three ways :—1. From the inside of the mouth without any extenial incisions ; 2. By the submental method thi’ough the mylo-hyoid space ; 3. By the division of the lower hp and jaw, and the application of the ecraseur. The excision of the whole tongue from the intmlor of the mouth, without any external incision, was not and could not be safely practised before the intro- duction of the ecraseur into sm’gical practice ; and it is to Chassaignac that we are indebted for this advance in operative surgery. There are many methods by which this operation may be performed, the difference in the minor details being dependent on the extent and situation of the cancer, and the amount of tongue that consequently requires extirpation. The following plan is the one that is most usually adopted, and that will be found effectual and safe in the vast majority of cases. The gag having been applied, the end of the tongue should be seized with hooked forceps and well dravm forwards and upwards. The Surgeon then cuts across the fimnum by means of strong curved scissors, and divides succes- sively the insertions of the genio-hyoid and genio-hyo-glossal muscles into thn524 DISEASES OF THE MOUTU AND THROAT. lower jaw, cutting freely backwards so as to liberate the base of the tongue. He now snips across the reflexion of the mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth fi-om the lower jaw, and then, laying aside the scissors, separates widely with his fingers the base of the tongue from these parts. As he does this the assistant, who has charge of the forceps, draws the tongue well forwards, and it comes bodily out between the lips. If the anterior pillar of the fauces offer .any obstacle it may be snipped across, and the wire of the ^craseur may then be applied well round the back of the organ, the shaft being pressed up under the base of the tongue. If the wii'e have a tendency to slip forwards, a large double hook should be passed in front of it into the base of the tongue, so as steady it and prevent its slipping. By now working it gradually, the whole organ can be removed. Nunneley, of Leeds, has devised an ingenious mode of applying the ecrasem’ BO as to remove portions of the tongue, or, indeed, the whole organ, as far back as the hyoid bone. This operation consists in passing the chain of the ecraseur through the centre of the mylo- hyoid space by means of a sickle-shaped needle, about 4| inches long and as broad as a bistoury blade. By this needle the chain is brought into the mouth close to the frasnum. Two or three cm’ved and strong hare-hp pins are now passed deeply into the tongue, obliquely, behind the seat of the disease, their points being made to project forwards below the organ, so as to prevent the chain from slipping. The loop is now gradually tightened, and the tongue is cut_or shaved off obhquely from behind forwards. Two ecraseiirs have been successfully used by Chassaignac in removing portions of the tongue. AYhen the disease only occupies one side, and it is not thought necessary to cut away the whole breadth of the organ, two instruments are required, which, as Chassaignac represents (Iig. 627), must be passed through the substance of the tongue in opposite dnec- tions, so as to isolate and detach the diseased portion. ^ In removing large portions of the tongue by means of the ecrasein (Fig. C-8), the instrument should be worked very slowly, in order that tme may be <riven for the vessels to contract; bnt, even with this precaution, hiemorrhap may occm-from the larger arteries to such an extent f ^o refinne the a^^^^ nation of the ligature.

Slight enlargement of the glands under the jaw should not bo any bar to the operation, provided the disease be limited, and the constitution good. If much enlarged, the glands may be excised at the same time with the disease of the tongue ; or if they be not of veiy considerable size, they may be left, when they will perhaps subside without the necessity of operation, as their enlargement may probably be dependent upon simple imtation ; should they continue indurated, they may readily be removed at a subsequent period. Submental Operation for Excision of Tongue.—Regnoh of Pisa pub- lished, in 1838, a description of a method by which the whole tongue could be successfully removed. The plan that he proposed was as follows. An incision of a semilunar shape was made along the line of the lower jaw, beginning near one angle and terminating close to the other. A perpendicular incision was carried from the centre of this line immediately under the chin to the hyoid line Fig. 620.—Lines of Incision in Regnoli’s Operation. Fig. 630.—Tongue (Imwn out between Jaw and Hyoid Bone. (Fig. 029). in making this semilunar incision, care must be taken not to woimd the facial artery on either side. The trunk of the vessel should be protected by the finger of an assistant as it ounces round the lower jaw, and the incision should be confined within the space between the two facials. The triano-ular flaps of the skin formed in the manner indicated are dissected back, and theDISEASES OP THE MOUTH AND THROAT. 526 muscles and mylo-hyoid space are now exposed. These must be successively divided ; the anterior bellies of the digastrics arc cut across, the mylo-hyoid muscle divided transversely at its anterior part; and the attachments of the genio-hyoid and genio-hyo-glossi are then to be detached from the lower jaw by a few touches of the scalpel, and by sepai-ating with the fingers the mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth. An aperture is then made into this by pushing the scalpel through it, and its reflexion from the inside of the lower jaw is divided as far back as the outer angles of the external incision. The submaxillary glands are pushed aside, and the tip of the tongue being seized with {I strong hook or ^ailsellum-forceps, the organ is drawn out to its full extent on to the anterior part of the neck, between the jaw and the hyoid bone, when the whole of it may be removed close to its attachments to the latter bone by means of the knife or the dcraseiu’ (Fig. 030). The latter instrument is to be preferred, as its use is attended by less haemorrhage than follows that of the knife. It will occasionally be found that the anterior pillar of the fauces is somewhat in the way of the appheation of the instrument. Should this be inconveniently so, it may be snipped across before the wire of the ecraseur is applied. By means of this operation, which I have several times performed, the whole of the tongue may be shaved off clean from the base of the epiglottis and hyoid bone. After the removal of the tongue the hfemon'hage will usually be found to be trifling ; but should one or other of the lingual arteries bleed, it may readily be seized and ligated. The line of incision in the skin must then be stitched up and supported by strips of plaster. The Buccal Operation.—Fm-neaux Jordan has introduced an operation winch consists in dividing the cheek on the affected side backwards as far as the ramus of the jaw, care being taken to go below the parotid duct. The tono-ue is then seized in the usual way, and cut off by two 6crasem’s worked simultaneously, the chain of one dividing the organ transversely close to the pillars of the fauces, that of the other severing the tissues along the floor of the mouth. I have performed this operation in one case of imilateral cancer of the tongue, and found that the organ could readily be reached, commanded, und a portion removed thi’ough the gap in the cheek After the operation is •coircluded, this is closed by bar e-lip pins. ^ Excision of Tongue after Division of the Lower Jaw.—SediUot of Stras- bui-o- described, in 1855, a method of removing the whole of the tongue, rvhich he stated that he had practised for some years with success. The operation consists in making a vertical section through the lower lip, sawmg through the inferior maxilla at its symphysis, separating the bone on each side, draudng the tongue forward and removing it. In performing this operation, its inventor recom- mends that the section of the lower lip should be made carefully through the nnedian line, and can’ied across the chin as far dovoi as the hyoid bone. Ihe lower jaw is then savm through at its symphysis. In order to fix the bone more •arefully after the operation, he recommends that, instead of making on rortkal incision, two oblique cuts should be practised nith the saw in this shape >, so as to form a triangle, the point of which corresponds to ti middle of the body of the bone, so that the two opposite sides may be locked “getr ate of the tongue. After haring th! muscles conneeting it to the tongue should be cut across ; the floor car VREMOVAL OF TOFGUE BY GALVANIC ECRASEUR. 527 mouth slightly detached from the bone, the two sides of which arc drawn asunder ; and the tongue then removed from the hyoid bone by a stroke of the kniie. The lingual arteries bleed freely, and must be at once secured. Fiddes of Jamaica recommends that the artery be divided and tied, first on one side and then on the other, so as to avoid all danger of haemorrhage. The opposite sides of the jaw-bone are then brought together, and held in position by wire twisted round the teeth, or passed through a hole drilled on each side, before the division of the bone. If Sedillot’s angular cut be adopted, the bone may be kept in situ much more easily than if the vertical incision to which he first I of all had recourse, and which is commonly adopted in this country, be 1 practised. The incision in the lower lip must be united in the usual way by hare-hp pins or sutmes. This operation was first done in this country by Syme and Nunneley, aud has of late years been very extensively practised by many Sm-geons. By it the whole tongue can be freely exposed and cut out from its deepest attachments. As soon as the tongue is separated, the stump should be di-awn foi*wards • and any bleeding point tied. Ice should be freely used for some days. Should secondary heemorrhage occur, it will be foimd that the actual cautery or the perchloride of iron, the free use of ice, or a spray douche of ice-cold water, will suffice to arrest it. A tendency to dyspnoea is sometimes manifested after the operation, owing to the hyoid boue Ming backwards. This is remedied by opening the mouth and drawing the stump forv^ard. The patient will not be able to swallow for some days,—the food, liquid as well as semi-solid, ac- cumidating in the cavity left by the removal of the tongue. He must there- fore be fed by enemata, and through an India-rubber tube passed down the oeso- phagus. There is often trouble from profuse sahvation for two or three weeks, O'rting to the patient being unable to swallow the Hseid saliva secreted by the wounded and irritated glands. This is best controlled by alum and pyrethrum gargles, and by binshing over the inside of the mouth with a solution of nitrate of silver as it is always tVblcso.e aa/Zcmfficuin: Fig. 631 --Renioyal of Toiigrie by Division ol Lower Jaw anil iScraseur.528 DISEASES OF THE MOUTH AND TllllOAT. bleeding ressels. If the knife be used for the removal of the tongue, the lingual arteries necessarily require ligature; and hence, if the organ have to be taken off near to its root, it is better to do this by one of the operations which open up the cavity of the mouth, such as division of the lower jaw, as in that Fig. 632.—Galvanic iScraseur. way the requisite space can be obtained to draw the root of the divided tongue well forward and to apply the hgatures. In using the ordinary ^craseur, much depends on the thickness of the wire or chain. Should this be too thin, it will cut at once through so fragile an organ as the tongue, and profuse bleeding will ensue. But if the 6craseiir have a moderately thick wire and be worked very slowly, the tongue may be removed with httle or even no loss of blood. In order to secure this desirable result, the galvanic ecraseur should be used in preference to the simple one. By working this slowly, using a platinum wire, and not employing too high a temperatm-e—a good red heat is quite sufficient—the whole organ may reachly be removed without the loss of a drop of blood. This I have done in several cases, in which the whole tongue required removal, from the inside of the mouth, without any cutting through cheek, jaw, or submental tissues. The operation is thus greatly simphfied, for all that is required is to divide, by means of a pair of scissors, the insertion of the lingual muscles into the lower jaw, to tear up the mucous membrane on each side by the finger, and perhaps snip the anterior pillar of the fauces, when the tongue can be drawn fairly out and its section completed. The following is a summary of the steps for the removal of the whole tongue from the hyoid bone by means of the galvanic ecraseur. 1. Chloroform, not ether, must be administered, as ether-vapour will ignite when the ecraseur is used. 2. An incision is made exactly in the median line through the lower hp, carried over the chin, and as far down as the hyoid bone. 3. The mucous reflexion, from the lower hp to the gum on each side, is dissected back. 4. The lower jaw is drilled on both sides, half an inch beyond the median line, midway between the alveolus and symphysis. ^ _ ' 5. The lower jaw is sawn through exactly in the median line. [ 6. A whipcord noose is passed through the forepart of the tongue. 7. The two fragments are separated ; the genio-hyoid muscles, &c., are cut -with scissors, and by means of the fingers and scissors all the soft structures on each side of the tongue are separated. _ 8. The tongue is then drawn forwards, and a stout najvus-needle is passed up through it behind the disease. ■ ICOMPARISON OF OPERATIONS ON TONGUE. 529 0.

The two sides of the lower jaw are then broughttogether by wire sutuies passed throiK^h the drill-holes, and the cut through the lip by harelip pms. 14. A drainage hole should be left behind the symphysis of the jaw, at the lower end of the incision. x> In comparing the relative merits of the simple and galvanic dcraseur tor the removal of portions of the tongue, it may be said that both instrimients are equally efficacious in the performance of the operation itself; that the dmsion of the organ by the simple 6crasem’ is more liable to be followed by hgemor- rhage at the time of the operation, which may always be readily controlled by ligature ; that the action of the galvanic 6craseur is more likely to be followed by secondaiy hjEmorrhage about the fifth or sixth day, at the period, in fact, of the detachment of the sloughs produced by its cauterising action ; but that by the very production of these sloughs the cauterising influence is extended into the stump to some depth beyond the line of incision, and thus tends to destroy morbid deposits or scattered cells, beyond the line of the actual section. In all respects, then, except so far as the liability to secondary haemorrhage is con- cerned, the galvanic ecraseur, in my experience, which, in my own practice and that of others, has been large in these cases, has the advantage over the simple wire one. HaemoiThage, at the time of the operation, may be arrested by drawing the tongue-stump forwards by means of hooked forceps, and tying the cut lingual artery with whipcord. As the tissues are brittle, this should include some sur- rounding structm’e. The ligature ends are all cut short. In one case, a coagulum formed in the pharynx before the vessel could be secured ; and I had to per- form laryngotomy. The patient made a good recovery, dying two years after the operation, from recurrence of the disease in the chest and one of the toes. Secondary hgemorrhage may be restrained by means of ice, the application of perchloride of iron, and pressure on the bleeding part. But if not fatal at the time, it is apt to be so by its recurrence, and by inducing exhaustion. Comparison of Methods of Operation.—In instituting a comparison between the three different methods of dealing with tumours of the tongue by ligature, the knife, and the ecraseur, it shovdd be understood that the same plan of treatment is not equally or indiscriminately applicable to all cases, but that one or other should be adopted according to the size, situation, and extent of the cancerous mass. If this be small and situated at the tip of the organ, this portion of the organ may be easily, quickly, and safely excised. If the disease be situated towards the side, so as to require the removal of perhaps one half of the anterior third of the organ, it may be cut out; but I think that it will be found safer and more convenient to ligature it. If it occupy the whole breadth of the anterior third, or even half of the tongue, I consider that removal by the galvanic (icraseiu- is the simplest and safest pro- cedure. If the posterior part bo superficially affected, the disease may be cut VOL. II. A530 DISEASES OF THE MOUTH AND THROAT. out. But if the organ bo so deeply alfoctod that the whole of it requires extir- pation, the galvanic dcraseur will be found to be easy of application, safe and efficient in execution ; and the Surgeon must have recourse to Sedillot’s opera- tion of the division of the lower lip and jaw in tlie central line, and the complete extirpation of the cancerous mass. Effect of the Removal of the Tongue on Speech.—Although distinct- ness of articulation is necessarily affected for a time by these operations on the tongue, yet it is usually completely restored when only the anterior third or half is removed ; the tissue of the organ recovering its normal mobility with remai'kable facility, and indeed appearing to possess a very considerable reparative power, so as almost to seem to be capable of repro- duction to some extent. Even after removal of the whole of the tongue, the power of deglutition is preserved, and that of articulation, although at first somewhat imperfect, eventually returns, so that the patient is able to speak so distinctly that strangers would not be aware of the loss he had sustained. Amongst the tortures to which Chi-istian martyrs were subjected in the early ages, and the punishments which have been inflicted on heretics, “ cutting out the tongue ” was one of the most barbarous. Martyrologists in describing this horrible mutilation have remarked with wonder, that, although it was practised with the view of depriving the sufferers of the power of speech, yet it often failed in its effect, and those who had been subjected to it were enabled to speak afterwards as plainly as before. This they have attributed to direct mhaculous intervention. But, as modern Surgeiy has shown that the power of speech retmms equally, whether a cancerous tongue have been extirpated by the kiiife of the Surgeon, or a heretical tongue by that of the executioner, we must rather look upon the return of speech as a physiological act, than as a miracle specially wrought for the benefit of those mutilated in and for the propagation of the true faith. Encysted, Fatty, and Erectile Tumours are met with not only in the tongue, but underneath it in the floor of the mouth. They require extirpation by the ligature, or enucleation by the scalpel, according to their situation and size ; and for these irregular operations no special directions can be given. In re- moAung such tumoiu’s as these, when situated under or by the side of the tongue, the knife must necessarily be used with much caution. It must, however, be borne in mind that, if these growths cannot be reached from the inside of the mouth, they may be got at by incision through the mylo-hyoid region, where there is but a slight thickness of soft parts between the smface and the floor of the mouth. E.annla, the most remarkable and common of the buccal tumours, may j occur under two forms. 1. A globular swelling, semi-transparent, evidently containing fluid, and often attaining the size of a walnut or a pigeon’s egg, may be situated under i| the tongue, pushing this organ upwards and backv'ards, and consequently in- terfering with deglutition and speech (Fig. 633). The walls of the cpt are usually thin, with small vessels ramifying on them ; its contents are glairy and very unlike saliva. This form of ranula is usually said to be a^ dilatation AVharton’s duct ; but there is no proof of the disease being of this nature, nor is it very easy to understand how so small a duct can be dilated to so ^ size as is occasionally attained by these tumours, which seem, in some cases a531 TREATMENT OF EANULA. least, rather to consist of independent cystic formations, such as commonly occur in connection with other secreting glands, and in other parts of the mouth. And this view of the case is strengthened by the fact that these globular cystic tumours containing glairy fluid may occur in the substance of the tongue itself^ far away from any salivary duct. ^Morrant Baker, who has investigated the connection between ranula and the "Whartonian duct, finds that, in cases of ranula, Wharton’s duct is quite free, without any alteration in size, and that saliva may be seen issuing from it. A probe passed into the duct is separated from the ranula by a thin membranous wall, showing clearly that the duct and the ranula do not communicate. I have, however, lately seen a case in which a ranula resulted from a wound of the floor of the mouth, in the situation of the Whar- tonian duct. The wound was caused by the accidental slipping of a pair of tooth- forceps during extraction of the first molar tooth. As the wound healed a ranula formed, the con- tents of which were thick and ropy, like the natural secretion of the submax- illary gland. It ultimately reached the size of a plover’s egg. That this tumour was formed by an accumulation of the secretion of the sub- maxiUaiy gland, there can be no doubt; but it is quite possible that the collection formed in the submucous tissue, and that it was not enclosed in an actual dilatation of the Whartonian duct. The Treatment of this fonn of ranula consists either in passing a seton through its walls, so that contraction may take place on this (Fig. G33); or else m the excision of a large portion of the anterior wall of the cyst,’the remainder contracting, until it at last becomes obliterated. 2. Besides the ordinary form of ranula, an encysted tumour, partaking of this character, is occasionally met with, lying above the mylo-hyoid muscle, between It and the buccal mucous membrane. It projects more distinctly intO' e nec' t an into the mouth, and thus forms a large tumour under the angle ^ ° semi-fluctuating, occupying, perhaps, ° between the lower jaw and the hyoid bone on one side. It attains e size ot an orange. In a case of this kind under my care, the contents of e tumour, which closely resembled cream-cheese in character, were athero- a ous, being composed of epithelial scales and fatty matter. —These tumours are best treated by making a free openino- into aeir“ooutcnts,stuffi.rg a: 7 h hnt, and allowing it to granulate and contract.

Salivaby Calculi are occasionally met with in connection with the sub- lingual, submaxillary, and parotid glands. They are most common in the sublingual gland, and will then be found to be situated in the Whartonian duct. From this situation I have two or three times removed them. Gross mentions a case of calculus in the duct of the submaxillary gland. '\\'herever occurring, they obstruct the duct and produce retention of saliva in it. Hence, when the salivary glands become actively secreting, as at mealtimes, the calculus, by preventing the escape of the sahvary fluid, causes distension of the gland, with pain and tenderness, so as to render mastication difflcult. The Treatment is simple. It consists in dividing the mucous membrane over the calculus and then extracting it with forceps. The largest which I have removed was of the size of a small damson-stone; it was loose in ■Wharton’s duct. DISEASES OP THE UVULA AND TONSILS. Elongation op the Uvula.—The uvula occasionally becoming elongated and hanging down into the pharynx, so as to touch the ejiiglottis and sensitive mucous membrane in its neighbourhood, gives rise to a great irritation of the fauces, and to a tickling or spasmodic cough, which can only be cured by re- moving the pendulous body. This little operation may be readily done by seizing the end of the uvula with a pair of polypus-forceps, and snipping it across near the root with a long pair of scissors. It is better not to remove the whole of the uvula. If this be done, throat-irritation is apt to continue. I have been most satisfied with the result of those cases, in which a stiunp from a quarter to the third of an inch in length has been left. For some years I have been in the habit of using a pair of “ vulseUum-scissors ” (Fig. 634), by which the uvula is cut off at the same moment that it is seized, thus rendering the operation easier and less irritating to the patient. A very ingenious American instrument, consisting of a pair of forceps and scissors combined, may be employed with the same view ; by closing the handles of this instrument the uvula is first seized, and is then immediately cut across (Fig. 635). Tonsillitis or Quinsy.—The tonsils are not unfrequently the seat of tlisease, becoming inflamed or permanently enlarged. When inflamed, they become swollen and red, with much pain in the side of the neck and ear, increased by any attempt at swallowing; there is usually rather a iirofiise secretion of saliva, and a good deal of swelling under the angles of the jaws ; the tongue is much coated with thick pasty mucus, and the voice is thick and nasal. The disease comes on suddenly, often accompanied by high fever, chills, and occasionally even delirium. The thermometer frequently rises to 105°, or even higher. In some cases, a trace of albumen may be found in the urine. Tonsillitis is often caused by exposure to impure air, such as results from the escape of sewer-gas into a house, and it is not uncommon amongst533 llYFERTIiOPlIY OF THE TONSILS. the residents in hospitals. It may be mistaken for diphtheria, scarlet fever, or erysipelas of the fauces. From diphtheria it is distinguished by the absence of exudation. The mucous secretion from the tonsil may somewhat resemble diph- theritic exudation, but it is readily dis- tinguished by its want of adherence, as it is easily removed with a camel’s-hair pencil. From scarlet fever, tonsillitis is distin- guished by the absence of the red tongue, and by the redness of the throat being pui-ple in tint, and limited to the tonsils and their immediate neighbourhood, and later on by the absence of rash. From erysipelas of the fauces it is more difficult to distinguish, but it will usually be found that the redness is darker in tint and less diffused than in erysipelas, and there is less oedematous swelling, and no tendency to the snper- i^iuuilsci&ioK.' vention of dyspnoea from oedema glottidis. There is also less glandular enlargement Kg. ess.-Forceps-Scissors. at the angle of the jaw. The Treatment should always be commenced by a good purge ; a calomel and colocynth pill will be found most efficacious if it can be taken. This is followed by the appheation of leeches under the jaw, of fomentations, the inhalation of the steam of hot water, and low diet, which need scarcely be enforced, on account of the difficulty and pain in swallowing. If the mouth can be opened, much relief may be given by scarifying the tonsils with a probe-pointed bistoury ; and, if abscess form, it should be opened early with a gum-lancet. The inhalation of the steam from a pint of boiling water, to which has been added a teaspoonfrd of creasote or carbolic acid, will often give much comfort by allaying the foetor of the breath. Hypertrophy oe the Toi^sils.—The tonsils may undergo various struc- tural changes. They may become hardened and enlarged as a consequence of repeated attacks of inflammation, or chronically and indolently hypertrophied by an expansion or outgrowth of their foUicular structure independently of any inflammatory attack ; or this chronic hypertrophied state may be greatly increased by plastic inflammatory deposit. A\ hen the tonsils are chronically enlarged, one usually suffers to a somewhat greater extent than the other. The condition is at once obvious on opening the mouth and depressing the tongue so as to expose the fauces fairly, and cannot be mistaken for any other morbid state. There are two distinct forms of chronic enlargement of the tonsils. Tn534 DISEASES OF THE HOD Til AND THROAT. the tonsil is largo, rather pale, hard, smooth, and semi-clastic. This disease is one "which occurs in children and young persons who have a general ten- dency to struma of the mucous membranes and their appendages. [Most commonly it develops vdthout any assignable or external cause, usually com- mencing at five or six years of age, and gradually increasing up to puberty, a period when the functional activity of these glands is greatest, and when they arc most exposed to irritation from zymotic diseases, especially scarlatina and measles. When once the tonsils have enlarged, they become a source of great inconvenience and of even serious derangement of health. The child is liable to attacks of inflammation of the throat, the tonsils then becoming congested, greatly swollen, and readily running into ulceration or suppuration. In consequence of these repeated attacks of inflammation, the enlargement of the tonsils increases, they become indurated, rugged-looking, and nodulated, projecting far forwards into the fauces, and sometimes even touching each other below the uvula. Kespiration, articulation, and deglutition are now SQi'iously interfered with. The mucous membranes of the nose and eyes become chronically congested, and there is an increased secretion, from the back of the throat and nose, of thick, tenacious, unhealthy, or foetid material, the swallowing of Avhich- is deleterious. The child cannot sleep without snoring, and is apt to start up with a feeling of suffocation; the voice becomes thick and husky ; the sense of hearing is blunted; and, partly from the in- cipient deafness, partly from the diffi- culty of breathing, causing the child to keep its mouth half open, the counte- nance assumes a peculiar vacant, semi- idiotic expression, which is very charac- teristic of the advanced stages of the disease. The most serious effect is the impediment to inspiration, Avhich in the more chronic and severe forms of enlarged tonsils will go to such an extent as to prevent the full inflation of the lungs, and thus occasion a per- manent flattening and contraction of the chest, imperfect aeration of the blood, and an interference with general nutrition. The Treatment of chronic enlai-ge- ment of the tonsils will vary according to the age of the child, and the degree and kind of hypertrophy and indura- tion of these organs. In the eailier and slighter forms of the disease, the enlargement of the tonsils may gradu- . ally subside as the child giws older and stronger ; and it is well not to be in too great a hurry to excise the tonsds m Fig. 63(3.—Tonsil-Guillo- tine aijplied.

The internal use of iron, and the local application of the tincture of iodine, of nitrate of silver, or of burnt alum, are occasionally serviceable. In the majority of instances, however, the disease Avill not bo materially influenced by any therapeutic means that may be adopted : and as the enlargement, continuing or increasing, gives rise to difficulty in respiration, and thus interferes with the due arterialisation of the blood in the lungs, and impairs the child’s speech, it becomes necessary to remove that portion of the gTov'th which projects beyond the arches of the palate. This may best be done by the ordinary tonsil-guillotine. The ring of the instrument being passed over the tumour, the cutting blade is pushed forwai-ds, and thus a slice of the projecting part of the growth is removed. In some cases difficulty is experienced in bringing the tonsil fairly into the ring of the instriunent; this may be obviated by drawing it through with a vul- sellum or double hook, and indeed, in some of the machines sold for the pur- pose a double hook is attached, which, being flxed into the tonsil, draws it forwards before it is sliced off" (Figs. G3G, G37). In performing this operation it is best for the Surgeon to stand behind the patient, more particularly in excising the right tonsil, as he can thus look better into the mouth and have more counnand over the head ; or he may stand in front, and use the left hand for the right tonsil, and mce rersd (Fig. G38).

This I have never observed, i But it is possible that enlargement of the tonsils to such an extent as to impede 1 respiration, and consequently to interfere with nutrition, may lessen the due * de^■elopmcnt of the gcnerati^■e or any other organs of the body. ^ Maugxant Disease of the Tonsil is not of common occuiTcnce. I have, H however, seen instances both of scirrhus and of epithelioma in this organ as fl a primary affection. In these cases the disease speedily extends to the pillars H of the fauces, the pharynx, and onwards to the floor of the mouth, the glands H under the angle become implicated, extensive infiltration of a brawny character H takes place in and around them, the swallowing becomes extremely painful H and difficult, respiration is impeded, the pharynx and palate become congested H and loaded ivith viscid mucus, and the patient eventually dies in a distressing I manner, partly from starvation, partly from constitutional contamination, fl Surgery only offers the means of relief in these sad cases, but can do nothing ■ of a curative character. In a case of encephaloid of the tonsil which was I under my care, I obtained some temporary advantage by removing portions of ■ the soft projecting and veiy vascular tumour by means of the ccrasem*. 9 DISEASES OP THE PHARYNX. H Inflammation of the Pharynx of a diffuse eiysipelatous character, with I loAV fever, not unfrequently occurs ; it is best treated by the application of a ■ strong solution of nitrate of silver, the use of emollient gargles, and the I internal administration of ammonia, with bark, stimulants, and support. If it IB have a tendency to run into sloughing action, the internal administration of J the mineral acids, with bark and stimulants, the nitrate of silver lotion, } and chlorinated gargles, are useful. Sometimes abscess forms in the sub- stance of the velum, and then requires to be opened with a narrow-bladed ' bistoury. ^ Abscess occasionally forms in the areolar tissue behind the pharynx, between the vertebral column and its posterior ivaU, which is consequently pushed forward so as to occlude the posterior nares, giving rise to a peculiar nasal . intonation of voice, if the abscess be situated high ; if Imv down, the conse- quences are more serious, as it may interfere with respiration by pressing upon • Fig. 639.—Pliaii'iigotome. the upper part of the larynx. This kind of abscess is often connected with disease of the bones at the base of the skull, or of the uppei cenical veitebra.. , In many cases, if left to itself, it would bm’st through the mucous membrane into the mouth ; but in others it comes forwards under the stenio-mastoid muscles into the fore part of the neck. By exploring the pharynx wffh the finger, which may readily be done, tension and fluctuation thioug 1 its pos tcrior wall may easily be made out.537 STRICTURE OF THE (i:SOFlIAGUS. Ill these cases the Treatment simply consists in letting out the matter by puncturing the tense membrane covering it. 'L’his may be done by means ot a shai-p pointed bistoury properly protected, the ordinary abscess-knife, or a pharyngotome (Fig. 08!)). The pus let out is usually oflensive, even though. the bones be not atf'ectcd. i . • Tumours are occasionally met vith in the postpharyngeal areolar tissue,. giving rise to the same swelling, difficulty in respiration and deglutition, and. lateral projection, as occiu- in abscess of this region. These growths are mostly cancerous, and speedily prove fatal. Polypi in the pharynx usually come down, from the nasal ca’iities, but sometimes spring Irom the inside of this canal on one or other of its margins. They are usually, when truly pharyngeal, of a. , malignant chai'acter, and gTOW with groat rapidity. The uses of the part ar& necessarily interfered with, and death may eventually result from obstruction to deglutition and respiration. Epithelioma of the phaiynx has occasionally been met with (Fig. 040). This form of the disease, which is of rare occurrence, does not differ from similar growths elsewhere. STRICTURE OP THE CESOPHAGUS. All diseases of the oesophagus have a tendency to constrict and eventually to occlude its passage, and hence are commonly described as Strictures of it. In some instances, the constriction of the oesophagus may be of a pimely nervous or spasmodic character; but in the majority of instances it is th^ result either of fibrous or of cancerous degeneration of the walls of tho: canal, and is then termed organic stricture. The simple non-malignant or- fibrous strictm-e in most instances eventually degenerates into epithelioma, and hence appears to be more rare than in reahty it is, as it is seldom met with after death in its undegenerated form. Scirrhous and encephaloid growth:i may, though rarely, develop in and around the oesophagus. d'ho great feature of oesophageal stricture is difficulty of deglutition ; but dysphagia may arise from many causes besides oesophageal strictm'e. Hence its diagnosis is in the highest degree important. CoxniTioxs PRODUCING Hysphagia independently of Stricture.— There are at least eight different conditions met with in the neck and chest capable of giving rise to dysphagia by compressing the oesophagus, indepen- dently of any strictine of that canal. 1. Tumours connected with the Pharynx.—Putting out of considera- tion tumours of the tonsils, which would always be readily discovered, polypus. ot the phaiynx may hang down and offer obstructions to the passage of food^. ^ In all polypoid growths connected with the jiharynx (which are exceedingly ^ rare) the nature, connections, &c., of the growth may be made out by drawing the tongue well forward, keeping it fixed w-ith the tongue-spatula, and passing V the finger well down behind the root of the organ ; the pharynx can thus A be explored, even below the root of the epiglottis, Avithout much difficulty., V A hscess may exist between the posterior wall of the pharynx and the spine, # possibly arising from caries of the cervical vertebne ; or a ywstpharymjeal -I tumour, as, for instance, a sarcomatous growth, may bo doA'elopcd from the ■ bodies of the vertebrm, and push the pharynx foi’AA^ards. d’hc eye is often538 DISEASES OF THE MOUTH AND THROAT. deceived in these cases, failing to detect the existence of an enlargement at the back of the pharynx ; but the finger readily recognises it. In the case of nbscess there is finctuation, and the dysphagia will be remo’S'ed by opening the abscess and letting out the contents ; and the solid, or semi-solid and soft, or j other feel of a tumour in this situation ^vill lead to a very probable guess as to its nature. ! 2. Morbid Conditions of tlie Larynx.—(Edema about the back of the ' ■epiglottis, or chronic oedema, ulceration, and thickening of the mucous membrane there, or oedema about the rima glottidis, may give rise to a tendency for licpiids to pass into the air-passages, and thus occasion a serious impediment in swallowing, the difficulty Ijeing attended with a feeling of spasm and sulfocatiou. By passing the finger down behind the root of the tongue, the state of parts can often be felt; but the combination of dysphagia with a suffocative fit, and these probably associated with laryngeal cough, are the chief points to be attended to in the diagnosis. 3. Tiuno'ar.s in the Heck ontside the (Esophagus.—Enlarged glands or a carotid aneurism, developing posteriorly, as has been knov.m to occur with the internal carotid artery ; or a tiunonr connected with the thyroid body, tightly bormd down by the sterno-mastoid muscles and cervical fascia, may, Iry pressing on the oesophagus, give rise to dysphagia. In all cases where that symptom is complained of, the neck should be examined carefully for tumours, which will generally be very readily detected, especially where the difficulty has existed for some time, and the person has become much emaciated from deficient nourishment. 4. Aneurism of the Innominate Artery.—When this disease has risen into the root of the neck it is easily recognisable; but in certain cases it develops first in a direction backwards, and then one of the eaiher symptoms is dysphagia. Indeed, the patient may sufier but little from any other symptom, nnd may apply to the Sm-geon for relief from it alone, quite unconscious of the existence of any serious disease. The diagnosis wifi, be effected by careful attention to the symptoms described at pp. 74—7G, vol. II. In such a case, much danger might be incurred by at once putting an instrument into the cesophagus, under the impression that stricture existed ; for the point of the bougie, or whatever instrument might be used, might perforate the sac of the aneiu’ism, and so give rise to instant death. 5. Aneurism of the Aortu, whether of the fusiform or the sacculated variety, may give rise to difficulty of deglutition by pressure on the gullet. In this case, also, there is great danger of the aneurismal sac being pierced by an instrument passed down for the piu’pose of ascertaining the existence of .stricture. The presence of the symptoms of intrathoracic aneurism, described at pp. 68—72, vol. II., will determine the diagnosis. G. Intrathoracic Tumours, such as enlarged bronchial glands, cancerous and other tumours, may be developed from the thoracic spine into the posterior mediastinum, and so compress the oesophagus. In such cases the diagnosis is very difficult. It is difficult enough to determine the existence of a timioiir, but stm more so to distinguish it from an anemdsm undergoing consolidation ; but dulness on percussion, and dyspnoea with dysphagia, together vit xe pain in or to one side of the spine, with neiualgia down the ai-ms or up ttic539 CAUSES OF DYSPHAGIA. side of the head, and a vavicose condition of tlie superficial veins of the chest, arc the si^iis on which we place our chief reliance in diagnosing the exist- ence of a'tumour. Indeed, in the diagnosis of aneurism of the aorta and of mediastinal tumour, I look upon the combination of dyspnoea with dysphagia, and fixed wearing pain between the shoulders, as of the greatest importance. , 7. Dislocation of the Sternal End of the Clavicle Backwards, whether merely a simple dislocation, or produced in consequence of excessive curvature of the spine, may give rise to difficulty of deglutition. Of the latter kind there is at least one case on record, which is nan-ated by Sir Astley Cooper, in which the sternal end of the clavicle by its pressure so obstructed the passage of food, that the patient was brought into a condition of extreme danger. The Surgeon, under whose care the patient was, very skilfully and creditably sawed through and detached the sternal end of the clavicle, and thus relieved his patient from the imminent danger in which she was placed. 8. Impaction of a Foreign Body in the Gullet.—If a man swallow such a thing as a piece of mutton-bone, or the settings of artificial teeth, it generally lies aci’oss the gullet in such a manner as to be easily felt Ijy the Sm’geon on passing a probang ; but there are other cases in which a foreign body becomes so lodged in the canal as to escape detection and remo^-al. Home years ago I Avas requested to see a j^atient Avho was said to have swallowed a piece of gutta- percha. He had, it appeared, in consequence of having lost several teeth, endeavoured to construct an artificial masticatory apparatus for himself, AAffiich had become loose, and he had accidentally swallowed it. A few days after- wards, finding that deglutition continued difficult, he consulted a very able Surgeon, who carefully examined him ; but, not detecting any foreign body, he considered that the piece of gutta-percha had passed into the stomach, and that the msophagus had been scraped by it in its passage down. Inability to swallow solids came on. I saAV him six months afterwards. The question then waSj whether the foreign body Avas still impacted in the oesophagus, or Avhether the symptoms arose from damage inflicted on that tube. I examined the oesophagus most carefully, but failed, as other Surgeons had previously done, to discoA'cr the existence of any foreign body. I thought that the oeso- phagus had been injured in some way, and that probably epithelioma was developing itself, and Avould, sooner or later, prove fatal. One day, Avhile at dinnei’, the patient suddenly A'omited a large quantity of blood, and fell down dead. On examination after death, Ave found that the piece of gutta-percha had formed for itself a bed in the wall of the oesoj)hagus, lying parallel Avith the inside of the tube, and that the ulceration of the mucous membrane caused by its presence had opened some oesophageal A^essel—AAffiich, we could not ascertain (it was not, however, either the carotid artery or the jugulai’ Affin) ; thus giving rise to the copious and suddeii haemorrhage Avhich had caused the patient s death. The surfaee of -the gutta-percha Avhich looked into the oesophagus, being constantly covered and smoothed over by mucus, and being proteeted, as it Avere, by a rim of SAvollen mucous membrane all around it, had alloAved the probang to pass easily Avithout its presence beiiif detected. °540 DISEASES OF THE MOUTH AND THROAT. These, so far as my experience goes, are the eight conditions which are likely to simulate stricture of the oesophagus ; and such are the points to be attended to in the diagnosis of these allectious from each other. With regard to their diagnosis from sti-icturc, the process is rather a negative than an affirmative one, proving the absence of tumour, aneurism, &c. The conclusion that the difficulty of deglutition can arise from no other cause than stricture is arrived at by a process of exclusion : and the situation and extent of the stricture are ascertained by exploration with a gum-elastic catheter or bougie. Forms op Stricture.—There are three forms of this affection which it is necessary to distinguish from each other, inasmuch as they differ greatly in the mode of treatment, and in the ultimate result. These are—1. Hysterical or Spasmodic Stricture ; 2. Fibrous Strictiue ; 3. Cancerous Stricture. 1. Hysterical or Spasmodic Stricture is met with chiefly in young females under twenty-five, though it may occur in much older persons of the hysterical temperament. It is possible for it to occur without evident organic disease or change of any kind. But I believe that the simple andpime uncom- plicated hysterical stricture is of very rare occmTcnce. In the majority of instances it will undoubtedly be found to be associated with and dependent upon some local change of structure, most commonly of a simple kind, such, as chronic inflammation of the pharyngeal mucous membrane, ulcerative abrasion of it, or follicular inflammation about the epiglottis and posterior part of the larynx. The disease in many cases is supposed to be dependent on or originally occasioned by the patient swallowing some foreign body, as a fish-bone, bead, bristle, &c., which after many mouths is still thought to be impacted. This is almost always erroneous. The foreign body may have been swallowed, and may have been the starting-point of the slight inflam- matory or ulcerative action that occasions the dysphagia, but it has long since disappeared, merely leaving a series of troublesome consequences in its train. The obstruction is generally high up in the phai’ynx, rather than in the (Eso- phagus ; being produced by the contraction of the constrictor muscles of the pharynx. The dysphagia is intermittent; Avhen the patient’s mind is allowed to dwell long on the affection, and she becomes anxious about it, \hen the difficulty is greatly increased ; whilst at other times, Avhen her thoughts are diverted from it, food passes easily. It will be found also, in these cases, that on attempting to pass a probang or large bougie, its progress will at first be resisted, but, by patiently and gently pressing down upon the strictm-e, the instrument will soon pass easily. 2. Fibrous Structure.—There are two kinds of organic strictm’e of the oesophagus—namely, the fibrous and the cancerous. Between these the dia- gnosis is often very difficult; strictimes originally fibrous sometimes degenerat- hig into or assuming a malignant form ; while others continue fibrous from the first. The fibrous stricture is scarcely ever idiopathic. It almost invari- ably orio-inates from the cauterisation of the interior of the oesophagus by the accidental or suicidal swallowing of some corrosive fluid, acid or alkaline, as the strong mineral acids or soap-leys, by which the mucous membrane is destroyed, chained as it were, and a cicatrix as of a burn forms. 1 he etmlogy, in fact, is an important element in the diagnosis, che fibrous strictiue be „ almost invariably the direct result of escharotic action, the cancerous occmii541 OF QiSOPlIAGUS. treatment OF STRICTURE without assignable cause, or being referred to ^ ^e’^mpk t tion (lenerally, on passing an instrument, we find that P fiCns sSeture it pasL smoothly, and gives no sensation of roughness, no feelin- of lacerating its way, or as if it were passing over an ulcerated sniface , no blood follows its withdrawal, and the patient does ''T£°is\io •and blood, though there may be copious mucous discharge, iheie is 10 material enlargement of the neck, no swelling of the cervical gland, no sigi Stricture.—In the malignant or cancerous stricture the instrument seems to pass over a rough and ulcerated surface, its introduction is fol- lowed by blood, and the patient coughs np blood, or blood and pus, mixed often with shreds of tissue—conditions all indicating a loss of substance (Fig. G40). There is also, generally, an ovoid or elongated swelling at the root of the neck ; the neighbouring glands may be affected ; there maybe cancerous tumours elsewhere; and the symptoms of the cancerous ca- ■chexia may be present. A fibrous stricture may, however, and very commonly does, degenerate into a malignant one—into epithehoma, though, perhaps, not into £cirrhus or encephaloid. The special causes of cancer of the oesophagus are not known. Treatment.—The treatment of stric- ture of the oesophagus will depend upon its nature. In the hysterical variety, the occasional introduction of a fuU-sized oesophagus-bougie, the application of bella- donna to the neck, and antihysterical treat- ment generally, iron, aloetics, douches, and diverting the patient’s mind from her malady, ai-e the means to be employed, advantageously employed large does of assafoetida. . The treatment of organic stricture is more difficult. In it care should be taken that the patient is principally kept upon nutritious slops, or upon meat that has been well chopped up, as larger fragments are apt to become impacted at the seat of constriction. The difficulty in deglutition udll, however, gra- dually increase, the patient being unable to swallow solids, then being reduced to pulpy food, and at last to liquid. After a time, he will not even be able to swallow these ; and then it becomes necessary for the Surgeon to feed him by •the introduction of a gum elastic catheter through the stricture, and the injec- tion of a sufficient’quantity of liquid or semi-pultaccous nourishment into the stomach twice a day. After a lew weeks, the irritation induced by the repeated dntroduction of the catheter will render its passage more and more difficult.

In such cases, Gan-od has very542 DISEASES OF THE MOVTII AND THROAT. until at last it becomes impossible to get it tbrongb the constriction. The patient may still be kept aliA-e for some Aveeks by nutritive enemata, but at last dies of exhaustion and starvation. Even in cancerous stricture of the oesophagus, death seldom occurs by secondaiy deposits, or by constitutional contamination, but in the Avay just pointed out. In some cases the disease extends to the posterior part of the larynx, the mucous memlu-ane covering the arytenoid cartilages and the epiglottis becomes involved, laryngeal stridor and dyspnoea ensue, and death may result from laryngeal spasm, unless life be prolonged by tracheotomy, Avhich in most cases becomes necessary. Such is the miserable course and termination of an organic stricture of the oesophagus. But the question noAV presents itself, can nothing be done to cure or even aiTest this disease ? The Palliative Treatment that is usually adopted in these cases consists in the introduction of bougies, and an attempt to thus dilate the stricture exactly as in the case of a constriction of the urethra. In introducing bougies into the strictured part of the oesophagus, there is, hoAvever, often a good deal of difficulty in making the point of the instrument enter the narrowed portion of the canal. This is more particularly the case when the constriction com- mences suddenly ; the oesophagus, as is frequently the case, being dilated into a pouch-hke sac above it, in AA’hich the food is apt to lodge, and the end of the instrument to be arrested, and at the bottom of which a narrow orifice exists, leading into the lower portion of the canal. In these cases, much patience and care may be required in overcoming the difficulty. Besides the ordinary dilatation by gi’adually increasing the size of the instruments used, I haA'e in some cases seen temporaiy benefit result from the use of a catheter, siuTOunded by a tube of vulcanised India-rubber, Avhich admitted of dilatation by the injection of water or air when introduced through the stricture; or from the employment of a tubular instrument, by passing a long small-sized bougie through the constriction, and then slipping a gum-elastic catheter with a rounded terminal aperture over it. It is needless to observe that, in the treatment of stricture of the oesophagus Avith bougies, no force should be used, lest the walls of the canal be perforated. From these means temporary relief may result in some cases ; but can an oesophageal stricture be thus cured ? I believe not. If the stricture were- ordinarily fibrous, as in the urethra, a cure might possibly be expected. But this form of oesophageal constriction must be excessively rare ; and if the disease can be made out to be malignant, but little good, and most probably much harm, Avill result from the irritation of dilating instruments. We may, therefore, employ dilatation as a means of temporary benefit, but not with the hope of effecting a cure. Should the stricture at last become so tight as no longer to allow the catheter to be passed, and food to be thus injected into the stomach, the patient must inevitably die of inanition, unless kept alive by nutritive enemata. By these means I have knoAvn life prolonged, by a fr’ail tenure it is true, for many weeks. In such cases it is an interesting physio- logical fact that, although the patients may continue to be moderately well nourished, and do not feel the pangs of hunger, they suffer excessively from thirst. Has surgery no resource in those cases in AA’hich the stricture has become543 0PEEATI02s^ OF GASTROSTOMY. a catheter impermeable, and in which neither food can be swalW nor passed, and in which, consequently, the most miserable death, death by sta c Uon, is impending ? In snch cases it has been proposed by &6dillot, to open the stomach by an incision through the abdominal waUs, and thus directlj introduce food into the organ. This operation has been practised several times by Sedillot, Fengcr of Copenhagen, Forster, and others. S^dillot, who has o-iven it the name of Gastroslomy, lays down the following rules for its & performance. , . , , c< Operation of Gastrostomy.—The patient lying on his back, the Surgeon,, who stands on the right side, makes a crucial incision, each limb of which is about an inch and a half in length, on the left side of the mesial line of the abdomen, two fingers’ breadth to the inner side of the costal cartilages, and about one-third nearer to the ensiform cartilage than to the umbilicus ; having- previously satisfied himself by percussion and palpation that the livei is not in his way. The dissection is carried through the abdominal wall, and the peritoneum is opened. The Surgeon then feels with the left index finger foi the left border of the liver ; by folloiviiig this upwards, the stomach is reached. This organ is then seized with forceps, dra-wn forwards and examined, so that its identity may be established. By means of three or four points of suture, the anterior wall of the organ is then fixed to the edges of the apertnre in the integuments, and an opening is made into it about midway between its two extremities, and a little above the lower margin. Nutritive injections must not be made into the artificial opening for the first few days ; not, in fact, until consolidation of the wall of the stomach to the parietal peritoneum has been secured, and a fistulous opening thus fairly established. This must be kept patent by properly adapted silver tubes, through which the nutritive injections are to be made. The value of this operation has as yet to be determined by experience. In but few cases in which it has hitherto been done has it succeeded in adding much, if anything, to the prolongation of life. In reasoning upon it, two objections present themselves. Fu’st, there is the great and immediate danger of destroy- ing life outright by the induction of peritonitis ; though it is by no means- impossible that the tendency to abdominal inflammation may be lessened by the previous starvation of the patient. But supposing this risk to be over- come, what is gained by the artificial opening ? It is true that through it the patient might be nourished ; but, as every idiopathic stricture of the oesophagus is either from the first of a cancerous character, or eventually assumes a malig- nant aetion, of what advantage is it to endeavour to prolong a precarious existence, Avhich must in a few weeks or months be cut short by the unchecked progi-ess of a malignant disease ? Would not the immediate danger of the operation much more than counteract all good to be eventually derived from it ? There is, liowover, one class of oesophageal strictures which are of the most, obstinate character, and rapidly fatal by simple occlusion of the tube, without any tendency to malignancy. These arc the constrictions that result from the swallowing of con-osivc liquids, whether acid or alkaline. In such cases as those, m which speedy death by starvation is inevitable, I think that recourse might with propriety be had to the operation of gastrostomy.544 DISEASES OF THE MOUTH AND THROAT. DISEASES OF THE LARYNX. The laiynx may be the seat of a great variety of morbid conditions. Acute €cdematons, and follicular inflammation ; ulcerations and chronic thickcnin^rs of the mucous membrane ; inflammation and necrosis of its cartilages ; and the formation of tumours or polypoid gi'owths in its interior, may all occur. Laryngoscope.—It is of the utmost importance in the diagnosis, and for the proper treatment of many of these affections, that a view should be obtained of the parts that are the seat of disease. This can only be done by means of the Laryngoscope. The introduction of this instrument into practice and its perfection have been a work of time. It appears to have been invented and first used in 1829, by Babington, who, under the term “ Glottiscope,” described an instrument consisting of a small mirror fixed to a wire shank, which, being placed against the %late whilst the tongue was held down, enabled him to view the glottis and upper part of the larynx; more especially when he illuminated these parts by throwing reflected light upon them from a mirror held in his left hand. Liston, Trousseau, and Avery, all made attempts in the same direction. But it was the celebrated singer Garcia, who, by throwing the sun’s rays into the back of his mouth from a mirror held in his left hand, and then introducing a dentist’s refiector into his mouth, saw the image of his own larynx and studied its movements in the reflection of the looking-glass. Hitherto, however, laryngoscopy had not been employed in the study and diagnosis of diseases of the larynx, and it is undoubtedly to Czermak that the merit is due of having been the first to make this application of the art. The Jaryngoscojje essentially consists of two instruments, a refiector (Fig. 641), which may be attached by an elastic band to the Simgeon’s forehead, and a mirror (Fig. 642), which is held in his right or left hand, according to circumstances. The mode of appheatiou and of use is extremely simple, and is illustrated in Fig. 641. The patient sits with his back to a good light; that of the sun does very weU if it can be obtained, but usually artificial light has to be employed. This may be obtained from a moderator or paraffin lamp. The flame of the lamp should be a little above the lei'el of the patient’s ear. The Siu’geon, facing the light, arranges the mirror in such a way that, whilst both he and the jDatient are in easy positions, a well defined circle of light covers the patient’s mouth. If, as in many arrangements, the muTor be over one eye of the Surgeon, he must so place it that he sees clearly thi’ough the hole in the centre, and can consequently employ both eyes in examining the throat. The patient now having the head very slightly inchned backward, opens his mouth and puts out his tongue. The Surgeon grasps the tip of the tongue gently between the fore-finger and thumb of his left hand, covered by a cloth or pocket-hand- kerchief He must be careful not to drag on the tongue, but merely to hold it steady ; and this is best accomplished by resting the fore-finger on the patient’s chin, fie now takes the small mirror and warms it over the lamp, so tliat the patient’s breath may not condense on it and obsciu’e the image of the larynx. Haling wanned it till he sees the cloud of condensed moistm-e from the lamp disappear, he tests it against his oivn check to feel that it is not too hot, andUSE OF THE LARYNGOSCOPE. 545 then introduces it in the following way. The handle being held like a pen, and rather to the left side of the patient’s mouth, the mirror is passed in care- fully, having its snrftxce parallel to the dorsum of the tongue, until the tip of the" uvula rests on its back, and is pushed slightly backwards and upwards by it. Caro must be taken, in doing this, that the reflecting surface does not touch the tongue, and so become dirtied, and that the miiTor is not passed so Fig. C41.—Ai)i)lioatioii of the Laryngoscope. The tongue should be di-iiwn forwards. j far as to touch the back of the pharynx, which in most patients would cause a an effort at swallowing. The miiTor being in the position above described, the ) Surgeon -will, if he see anything, Aiew the back of the pharynx reflected on its ^ surface ; but, by gently and steadily raising his hand, so as to render the angle & formed by the surface of the mirror with the patient’s body about half a right angle, he will bring the opening of the glottis into view. By raising the hand still a little further, he can examine the epiglottis and the root of the tongue. It must be remembered that the image thus produced is reversed in the antero- posterior direction, the parts that appear antei’ior on the mirror being really posterior ; while in the transverse direction there is no reversal. hen the Surgeon requires both hands, as in the application of caustics or in the removal of gi’owths or foreign bodies, the patient must be made to hold liis own tongue, or it must be held by an assistant. The Surgeon then holds the mirror in his left hand, and the instrument he is using in the throat m his right. Sometimes all view of the larynx is obscured by the patient obstinately arching the tongue in the mouth. It must then be hold down bv VOL. II. J N N546 DISEASES OF THE MOUTH AND THROAT. a spatula. In some patients, the fauces arc so irritable that the slightest touch causes violent retching. This may he allayed by sucking ice for a short time before the laryngoscope is employed. Lauyngitis.—Inflammation of the larynx principally occurs in adults, from exposm-c to cold, to the infection of erysipelas, or to the general occasioning causes of the low forms of inflammation. It differs essentially fr-om the croup of children, which is attended by an albuminous exudation, and spreads down- wards into the bronchi; whilst in laryngitis there is no effusion of plastic matter, and the disease is confined to the larynx itself. Laryngitis may not only be of an acute or a chronic kind, but the acute form like’wise presents two distinct varieties, according to the parts affected, the cause from which it arises, and the condition of constitution in which it occurs : in one, the true Acute Lar3mgitis, the inflammation is chiefly seated in the mucous membrane ; in the other, the (Edematous Iiai'3rugitis, the affection chiefly occiu’s in the submucous areolar tissue, within and around* the larynx. In all inflammatory affections of the larynx, whether acute or chronic, there is gi’eat danger to life ; the rima glottidis, that narrow chink through which aU the air destined for respiration must enter, becomes readily occluded, and asphyxia consequently results. This may happen either by the swelling of the lips of the glottis, frrom the effusion of plastic matter within or upon them ; or by the occurrence of spasm in the larynx ; indeed, there is always more or less spasm conjoined with aU the inflammatory affections of this part of the air-tube ; and this spasm, being superadded to already existing mechanical occlusion, commonly proves fatal. These laryngeal spasms do not at first recur oftener than at intervals of half an hour or an horn'; but as the disease advances they become more frequent, and in any one of them the patient may be carried oft. It is of importance to bear in mind that death may occur in these cases, although a considerable portion of the cavity of the larynx continue free. Thus Cheyne states that there are always in croup at least three-eighths of the cavity of the larynx open for the transmission of air; and that death must conse- quently result from some other cause than mere mechanical obstruction. This freedom from permanent occlusion commonly occurs in cases of laryngitis; and the immediate cause of death in the majority of instances appears to be spasm, conjoined with defective arterialisation of the blood, which, becoming dark and poisonous, causes congestion of the lungs or brain, and thus low pneumonia and convulsions. Ac'u.'te Laryngitis.—The Symptoms are those of local inflammatoiy action of an acute kind, conjoined with those of interference with the proper admis- sion of air to the lungs. The mucous membrane is the part principally inflamed, and but little effusion takes place under it; hence the symptoms are not always indicative of such early or intense interference with respi- ration, as is met with in the oedematous form of the disease. In acute laryngitis there are pain and tenderness on pressing upon the larymx, more especially about the pomum Adami. The voice at first is harsh and rough, then stridulous or sonorous ; and deglutition becomes difficult. ^ There is expectoration of frothy mucus, sometimes tinged with blood. U ith t e laryngoscope the intensely injected state of the mucous membrane o larynx can be seen ; but this is not accomplished without difficulty, partly547 (EDEMATOUS LARYNGITIS. From the irritability of the fauces, and partly from the large amount of tenacious mucus which usually surrounds the glottis. The_ difficulty in swallmving is often at first the most prominent symptom, and continues throughout; dyspnma, often of a spasmodic character, then appears, the lips becoming livid, the features pale and bedewed with perspiration, the eyes watery and bloodshot, and the respiratory muscles being called into violent action ; the nosh-ils are dilated ; gasping efforts at breathing, and sudden fits of increased difficulty in inspiring come on ; at the same time the pulse becomes feeble, though it oontinues rapid ; and, unless efficiently relieved, the patient will speedily sink. When it proves fatal, the acute usually runs into the oedematous form of laryngitis. Treatment—Y\\q treatment should be actively antiphlogistic. Xo time must be lost, otherwise the patient will fall into a hopeless state of asphyxia. Free blood-letting, the application of an abundant supply of leeches to the larynx, and the administration of calomel in large doses, with antimonials, must be employed. If, notwithstanding the administration of these remedies, the difficulty in respiration continue to increase, the windpipe must be opened before the lungs and brain become irretrievably engorged. It is no easy matter to determine when it is no longer prudent to trust to active antiphlogistic treatment, and when recourse should be had to operation ; indeed, the deter- mination of this point may be considered as one of the nicest questions in singery. As a general rule it may be stated that if, notwithstanding the antiphlogistic means above indicated, the dyspnoea become gradually more urgent, and the paroxysms of spasmodic difficulty of breathing more frequent and severe, then no time should be lost in the performance of the operation, for however short a period the disease may have existed. I can truly say that I have seen several cases lost by delaying the performance of this operation, but never one by opening the mndpipe too early. Indeed, if the opening be even made somewhat early, I do not think that much if any harm results, as the larynx is thereby set at ease; and, on the laryngitis being subdued by the ^ continuance of proper treatment, the apertmn, which has simply served as a i breathing-hole, may be allowed to close by granidation. ' (Edematous Laryngitis is seated chiefly, if not entirely, in the submucous J) areolar tissue, and frequently comes on in the course of chronic affections of ^ the larynx. It may, however, be of a distinctly erysipelatous character, occur- di ring as the result of exposure to infection, or to atmospheric vicissitudes. In ii fact, in many cases it appears to be at times epidemic, and in its pathological conditions resembles closely phlegmonous erysipelas of the part; the mucous membrane becoming red, pulpy, and swollen, and the areolar tissue Ij^ing j beneath it infiltrated with semi-puriform plastic matter. In this form of the < disease, the fauces are reddened, dusky and swollen ; there is much and early *j flyspncea ; the voice becomes hoarse, rough, and speedily extinct; deglutition O becomes very difficult; and, on passing the Anger over the back of the tongue, ‘ft the epiglottis will be felt rigid and turgid. There may be some degree of ® tenderness about the larynx ; Imt the local symptoms, which are less acute, are attended by a greater amount of dyspnoea than in the acute form of laryn- gitis. The dyspnoea is usually peculiar in character in the intervals between the spasms. Inspiration is always more or less difficult, as the swollen and N N 2548 DISEASES OF THE MOUTH AND THROAT. fjudematous parts fall together in a valve-like manner over the opening of the glottis. Expiration is, on the other hand, comparatively easy. In oedema- tons laryngitis there is also a good deal of spasm associated with the local turgescence. The spasms sometimes come on early, and carry off the patient at once. They are very apt to be brought on by speaking or swallowng; but, as the disease advances, the dyspnoea may become more continuous, with great restlessness, a cprick, small pulse, and convulsive breathing, the countenance being pale, sunken, and clammy, and the eye dull. Stupor at length super- venes, and speedily tciminates in death. The oedematous infiltration in this form of laryngitis is principally confined to the submucous areolar tissue ai’ound the epiglottis, at the margins of the glottis, and to that which lies at the back of the thyroid cartilage. In these situations- the tissue is distended Avith sero-plastic fluid, of an opalescent appearance, so as almost completely to occlude the rima glottidis (Fig. 643). It is a pathological fact of much importance, that this effusion never extends below the true vocal cords, being limited at this point by the direct adhesion of the mucous membrane to the subjacent fibrous tissue, without the intervention of any areolar membrane. Diagnosis.—It is of great importance to make the diagno- sis between the two forms of laryngitis. In the acute variety of the disease, antiphlogistic treatment is of great moment ^ in the oedematous form it is comparatively useless, for here elfusion sets in early, and nothing is left for the Surgeon but to open the air-passage, so as to give the patient breath- ing-room, whilst the disease is being subdued. The laryngo- scope is of the greatest use in arriving at a correct diagnosis. It is somewhat difficult to use in these cases, especially if there be much dyspnoea, but supposing even a momentary glance be obtained of the opening of the glottis, the condition depicted in Fig. 643 may readily be recognised. In addition to this, the epidemic character of the affection, the absence of much pain in the larynx, and the dusky-red and swollen fauces, wiU point to the oedematous variety. Then, also, the effect of antiphlogistic treatment should be taken into aceount. If after its active employment, no alleviation of the symptoms occur, it is only reasonable to suppose that the obstruction to breathing is owing rather to a lAurely mechanical obstacle than to simple inflammation. Treatment —The treatment of oedematous laryngitis must be antiphlogistic thouo-h the'constitution will not usually bear any very active measures. Leechino- under the jaAVS and over the larynx, AAdth the administration of anti- monials'and salines, Avill be especially serviceable. In many cases, scarifi- cation Avith a hernia-knife or probe-pointed bistoury about the root of the epiglottis, the sides of the glottis, and the back of the thyroid cartilage, will be found the most ready means of unloading the infiltrated mucous membrane. The operation of scarification may be more accurately performed by using the laryngeal lancet, whilst the glottis isbrought into view by the use of the laryngo- scope^ In these cases, however, it is especially necessary to open the windpipe befL it is too late, and the lungs have become engorged. After the proper ein- Fig. 643.—CEdonui tiie Glottis.I CHRONIC LARYNGITIS. 549 I ploymeiit of the means that have been indicated and their failure, the less delay I there is in opening the aii'-passage through the crico-thyroid membrane, the S better. The Sm-gcon should not wait until extreme and continuous dyspnoea i lias set in ; this may never occur, the difficulty in breathing being rather i spasmodic than continuous, and in one of the spasms of dyspnoea life may { suddenly become extinct. The lungs may become fatally congested, if the t •difficulty in breathing be allowed to continue too long. The operation adds D but little to the patient’s danger, but the increased risk is immense if it be [ delayed to an ad\-auced period. Not unfrequently this operation is delayed 3 until too late ; there is, I think, more risk of doing this than of opening the » Avindpipe too early. When once dyspnoea with laryngeal spasm has fairly set ] in, every moment is precious, and the patient may at any time be carried 3 off by the recurrence of the spasmodic seizures. The patient does not die j g-radually asphyxiated, but is suddenly seized Avitli a spasm that terminates il his existence. If the oedematous laryngitis become chi'onic, sloughing and putrid suppura- i tion of the submucous areolar tissue may occin, as in phlegmonous erysipelas ,( -of other parts of the body, and the patient may die partly from asphyxia and (, partly from typhoid symptoms, with putridity of the breath and mouth. In I these cases the administration of stimulants and tonics, more particularly ( port wine and bark, with free sponging of the part with a strong solution of j nitrate of silver, viU be ui-gently required. Chronic Laryngitis.—The larynx is liable to various chronic diseases of a K serious chameter, some of which are incurable, leaving a permanent impair- i ment of the vocal and other functions of the larynx. Those affections present || gTeat variety: and many give rise to Ajohonia, or loss of voice. Chronic I laiyngitis may ailse from cold in relaxed and debilitated subjects, or after pro- longed over-exertion of the Aroice in speaking or singing. This form is common amongst clergymen, and hence is familiarly known as the Clergyman's Sore- Throat ; it is also of frequent occurrence amongst singers, but may be met Avith among all classes of the community. Other forms arise fr’om deposit of tubercle, or in coimexion with tubercular disease of the lungs ; and others, I again, as the result of sy|Dhilis. In fact, so common are these two causes, that [ in all cases of chronic laryngitis not arising as the dii’ect result of OA*er-exertion ^ ■of the A'oice, one or the other of these diseases should be suspected and care- \ fully seai-ched for. In simple chrome laryngitis the A'oice at first becomes hoarse, and after- 3 A\aids reduced to a whisper. There is an increased secretion of mucus, and the patient is constantly troubled by a tickling or spasmodic cough, and at the J same time there is usually a feeling as if there AA^ere some constant cause of irrita- , tion in the throat, attended by a desire to cough up and expectorate. Examina- I tioii, by means of the laryngoscope, shows the mucous membrane of the thi-oat ^ congested, relaxed, and thickened. The true vocal cords have lost their shai’p I someAvhat rounded, and at the same time, instead of the pm-e white colour natural to them, they are usually of a pink tint. Occasionally smaff A\art-hke gi-owths may appear on the vocal cords or elsewhere, as the result of simple chronic laryngitis. In the ha«rmlar variety the symptoms are at first much the same as in the55° DISEASES OF THE MOUTH AND THROAT. simple : but as the disease advances, the expectovation becomes more and more puriform, the cough increases, the patient emaciates, is affected witli niglit sweats, and at last sinks and dies. This A’ariety is often spoken of as Larijmjeal i Fhthis'is. In this form of the disease, a marked feature, as seen l)y the laryn- jk goscopc, is the rounded thickening of the arytasnoid cartilages, accompanied > by a similar condition of the arytmno-epiglottidean folds of mucous membrane. I’atchcs of ulceration, often having a Avhite or a yellowish surface, form later in these parts. The epiglottis is usually congested, but not extensively ulcerated. Ulceration and thickening of the vocal cords are also common. When the affection is at all adA’anced, disease of the lungs is almost invariably present, and it is only in rare cases that the larynx is affected first. In the syiAiiliiic variety the symptoms much resemble the tubercular, but the constitutional condition is different, and the lungs remain healthy. The ] laiyngoscope shows us also that the local appearances are not exactly the I same. The epiglottis is often extensively affected, in some cases being com- pletely destroyed. The swollen rounded condition of the tips of the aiytmnoid cartilages, common in tubercular laryngitis, is not so marked. At the same time the ulceration frequently extends to the pharynx, and ulceration, or the scars of old ulcers, may be seen on the tonsils. The vocal .cords are often more or less completely destroyed, and not unfrequently the disease leads to necrosis of the laryngeal cartilages (see p. 553). The syphihtic form of ulceration gives rise in many cases to narrowing of the glottis, and tracheotomy is much more frequently required in this variety than in the tubercular. Diagnosis.—Examination of the larynx by means of the laryirgoscope will always serve to point out the true nature of the affection, and to prevent its beinsr confounded AAuth chronic bronchitis or catarrhal attacks ; and attention O to the points above indicated, Avith a careful inquiry into the constitutional condition of the patient, together Avith a stethoscopic examination of the chest, Avill usually determine the variety of the disease fr’om Avhich he is suffering. Treatmejit—ThB treatment of the various chi-onic inflammations of the mucous membrane of the pharynx and larynx requires to be conducted by careful regulation of the general health and selection of climate, avoidance of exposure to cold, and attention to digestion; and especially by the local appheation of various astringent vegetable and metallic solutions. In the milder forms of the disease, a satm’ated solution of tannin or glyce- rine, apphed by means of a camel’s hair brush or a sponge-probang, AAnll be found useful. In many cases the best results foUow the inhalation of solutions of tannin or sulphate of zinc in a “ pulverised ” form, apphed by means of the ordinary spray-douche, such as is used for procuring anassthesia l^y the local application of ether. But of all these astringents none equals in value the topical application of a solution of the nitrate of silver, which may almost be looked upon as specific in the simpler forms of this disease. _ , The practice of treating chronic disease of the larynx by the application of a strong solution of the nitrate of silver is by no means of recent origin. Many years ago it Avas employed by Sir C. Bell; and before him Bretonneaii applied the solution in these cases by means of a sponge attached to a inece ot Avhale-bone. Of late years this practice has been brought very iiromiiiently55^ LOCAL APPLICATIONS TO THE LARYNX. Ijcfore the profession 1)V Trousseau, and by the i\_nierican Suigeons, especially Horace (Ireen and J. AVarren. n Of the great value of this treatment in laryngeal disease, there can be no i| doubt. I believe it to be almost impossible to bring deeply seated and very I chronic inflammatory or ulcerative affections of this part of the air-passages to L a satisfactory termination by a)iy other means. The mode of application that I is the simplest and is very eliectual, consists in depressing the tongue with a proper spatula, and then passing a throat-sponge, consisting of a small piece of •; this material firmly attached to a curved whale-bone stick (Fig. 044), and ^ satinated with a solution of nitrate of siHer, down to the parts that are 1 diseased, so that the liquid may be applied to the Avhole of the affected surfaces. fl By the help of the laryngoscope, the solution may be V'ery accurately applied > to the inflamed part by means of a large camel’s-hair pencil, firmly attached to a I piece of wire bent to the proper angle, and set in a bundle. This solution Ishoidd vary in strength from half a drachm to a drachm of the salt to an ounce of distilled water ; most commonly, the latter strength will be most useful. This plan of treatment has been much practised of late years in this country, and Anth considerable success in a large number of cases. Some of its advo- cates, however, not content with curing in this way disease that is vdsibly seated in the throat, state that the morbid action extends down the trachea into the bronchi, and that it is necessary to follow it in these situations. They accordingly speak of passing the probang or brush between and beyond the vocal cords, and of sponging and mopping out the interior of the larynx I and the lower parts of the air-tube, and of applying the caustic solution to them, as if this Avere a proceeding that could be adopted with as little difficulty as jAassing the sponge into the nares. I cannot believe, however, that this [practice, though commonly spoken about and professedly employed, is ever in reality earned out. Any one acquainted Avith the physiology of the larynx knows hoAv acutely sensitiA’e it is, and hoAv it resists the introduction of any f foreign body by the most violent spasmodic fits of coughing, in its normal p state ; and any Surgeon Avho has seen the effects resulting fr’om the fair and i complete inhalation of a drop or tAvo of solution of nitrate of silver in a morbid and iiTitable condition of this tube, must feel sure that no sponge saturated Avith a solution of this caustic could ever haA'e been thrust doAvn between and f beyond the vocal cords into the trachea and lAronchi. Ihe utmost that can be done is that, guided by the laryngoscope, a small p brush may be momentarily passed betAveen the vocal cords, but the spasm so is caused renders it impossible to do more. ^ Other instruments have also been passed beyond the true cords, and Avarty growths have been in this Avay removed om the coifrs themselves ; but the moment they are touched, spasm occurs. . e most that can be done is a sudden touch of a brush or snatch Avith a forceps or loop of Avire. Any more deliberate proceeding is impossible. Inhalation of the Nitrate of Silver in Powder is most conveniently552 DISEASES OF THE MOUTH AND THROAT. done by mixing it, in proper proportions, with some innocuous impalpable powder, such as ground and dried sugar. The strength may vary ; one part of nitrate of silver being mixed with twelve, sixteen, or twenty of sugar. A small quantity of the powder so prepared should be put into the end of a thick glass tube, which has been bent nearly at right angles, about one inch ft’om its extremity. The Surgeon, placing his finger over the orifice of the stiaight part of the tube, caiTies the bent end behind the tongue, over the epiglottis ; lie then directs the patient to make a sudden inspiration, and at the moment of his doing so takes away his thumb, so as to allow the powder to be draivn out of the tube and into the air-passages along with the current of inspired air. In this way the nitrate of silver may, in some cases, be veiy conveniently applied to the whole of the affected mucous sm’faces without the iiTitation produced by the friction of the sponge. Injection of the Solution of Nitrate of Silver may easily be done by means of the instrument that is here delmeated (Fig. CIo), and which I have had constructed for this purpose. It consists of a silver tube, perforated at the end, and having a small piston moving in it ivith a spouge attached to its lower surface. The instrument is charged by dipping the end in the solu- tion, and then drawing back the piston-rod. It is then passed into the pharynx, or between the lips of the glottis, and the fluid is injected into the air-passages or upon the inflamed sinfaces in a number of fine streams, by pushing down the piston and compressing the sponge. By means of this laryngeal syringe the nitrate of silver can be apphed to any part of the pharynx, wnthout irritating the tender mucous membrane by the contact of a rough body ; and, by applying its nozzle to or between the lips of the glottis, the fluid may be readily thrown down into the interior of the larynx with the greatest certainty and ease. In those cases in which it is wished to apply the solution of the nitrate of silver to the air-passage, I greatly prefer using this simple instrument to the ordinary sponge, the mere pressine of which upon a tender mucous surface may be a source of irritation. When the mucous membrane behind the velum, or that of the posterior nares, is affected, the solution may readily be applied to these parts by turning the end of the instrument upwards, and then injecting it directly on to the affected sinfaces. In whatever way the caustic is used, its application should be repeated about eveiy second or third day, in order to insine its fuU effects. In some instances, however, advantages may be obtained by using it every day ; in others, again, a longer interval is required than that just stated. Results of Chronic Lax’yngitis.—In the more advanced forms of chronic disease of the larynx, the submucous areolar tissue becomes infiltrated with Plastic Deposits. The mucous membrane itself becomes swollen, congested, and ulcerated in patches ; vegetations form, perhaps, at some parts, and deep ulceration takes place at others, so that the whole surface becomes incgular^TREATMENT OF LARYNGEAL DLSEASE. 553 and loses its natural smoothness. These morbid appearances are not confined to any one part of the larynx, but may occupy any portion of that organ above the vocal cords. The large plane of mucous membrane covering the arytmnoid and the posterior part of the thyroid cartilages especially becomes involved. The epiglottis Ijecomes thickened and rigid, and the rima glottidis is narrowed. The pharyngeal mucous membrane becomes implicated, respiration is croupy, stridulous, and harsh, deglutition difficult, and there is abmidant muco-puru- lent expectoration, and wasting of the body. These diseases are often of sj-philitic origin, and, after continuing for some length of time, give rise to hoai’seness, cough, shortness of breath, a pale, pasty, and oedematous look about the face, with suffused eyes and constant difficulty in breathing. In these circumstances there is a constant tendency to acute inflammation supervening on the chronic laryngeal disease ; and the affection commonly proves fatal by the induction of oedema glottidis, often coming on with great rapidity. Necrosis of the Cartilages of the Larynx not unfrequently happens in the more advanced forms of this affection, attended by all the signs, consti- tutional and local, of the so-caUed Laryngeal Phthisis, and by the expecto- ration of lai’ge quantities of fetid puriform sputa, often streaked vdth lelood, and occasionally containing masses of the necrosed and disintegTated cartilage. In many cases Abscesses form outside the tube, and after much irritation and distress open externally ; and not unfrequently they are met with to such, an extent, as to undei’mine and disorganise the greater portion of the tissues of the anterior part of the neck. Where they correspond to the necrosed patches of cartilage, they give rise to aerial fistulm, through which bubbles of air escape dmlng respiration. T) eaiment. In the treatment of these more severe diseases of the larynx, the daily application of nitrate of silver A^dll be found of great benefit. It should be freely applied to or injected upon the mucous membrane about the epiglottis, within the lips of the glottis, and more especially that loose and filamentous tissue which is extended over the back of the thyi-oid cartilage, and which is commonly the seat of much chronic in-itation, and the chief source of^ the muco-puriform discharge. At the same time, the internal ad- ministration of bichloride of mercury with sarsaparilla will often be found of great service, more particularly in those cases in which the disease is of a syphffitic character ; the patient being kept in a regulated temperature, not uUoved to exert his voice, and avoiding all laborious exertion.

AVlieiievcr acute inflammation supervenes in these cases, with a tendency to oedema about the glottis, the patient should be narrowly watched, as he may readily be carried off by the sudden swelling of the lips of the rima, or by the supervention of spasm. In cases of this kind, the air-passage may be required to be opened to allow respiration to be earned on ; and this operation must not be delayed until such time as the patient falls into an asphyxial condition. Nervous Affections of the Larynx occur both in children and in adults. In children the affection, commonly called Spasmodic Croup, comes on sud- denly and runs its course with great rapidity. The child is seized, often without previous warning, with difflculty in breathing, uses ’violent efforts to inspire, becomes black in the face and convulsed, and may die before anything can be done for his relief. In other instances he gapes and gasps a few times, and eventually recovers himself with a long deep-drawn whooping inspiration. In cases of this kind, the Treatment at the time of the fits consists in dashing cold water in the face, in exposing the body to a current of cold air, and in using fi'iction to the extremities. If asphyxia occur, artificial respiration must be kept up either through an opening made in the windpipe or by the mouth. In the adult, these spasmodic affections of the larynx may come on either from pure hysteria, or from irritation of the laryngeal nerves by the pressure of tumours or aneiu’isms upon them. In other instances they arise from the presence of some local inflammatory mischief about the glottis. In the hysterical fonn of the affection the ordinary remedies for hysteria, together with cold douches, will be of essential service. In some cases, however, the obstruction to respiration is so great, that the Surgeon may almost think it necessary to have recourse to operation. When the disease arises from iirita- tion to the trunks of the nerves, such a procedure is seldom justifiable, as the occasioning cause is usually in itself of a fatal character. Extirpation of the Larynx.—Billroth has twice performed this opera- tion for cancer. The fii’st case survived, the second died. The operation has also been done by Langenbeck, Schmidt, Heine, and Bottini. It appears to me to bo at best a bairen triumph of surgical skill. If it be done to cure the patient of the cancer, it -will necessarily fail in that object; if it be done to relieve him of sufferings arising from obstructions to breathing, irritative cough, &c., then these objects Avould certainly be more safely, and probably be quite as effectually attained by tia- cheotomy. Tumours or Polypi occasionally form in the larynx. They are commonly gTanular, or small caulifiower- looking bodies, though they occasionally attain the size of a hazel-nut. In structure they are usually epithelial, i occasionaUy fibrous, and eventually may become can- Fig. 646.—El'itheiioma in (]7ig. 640). They ueccssarily produce aphonia, ^ interfere with respiration, and at last may give rise to asphyxia by obstructing the cavity of the laiynx.

Johnson, and Morell Mackenzie, in this, country, and by I\Ioura-Bourouillou of Paris, and other continental Surgeons. Gibb, in cases of this kind, succeeded in passing a loop of silver wire round the- bases of two such gi-owths, lying just within the true vocal cords, and then detaching them by draAving the Avires through a steel cannula, and so tighten- ing the loop. This ingenious operation has been performed several times Avith the aid of the laiyngoscope. Thyrotomy has been performed in some cases. This operation consists in opening the trachea and introducing a trachea-tube,, so as to enable the patient to breathe during the operation and during the after-procediu-c. The crico-thyroid membrane is then punctured, the thyroid cartilage slit up exactly in the median line, and the growth thus extracted by Avhat appears to bo and is a formidable operation, but Avhich has hitherto been attended by successful results. After the operation the parts are accurately brought together, and the irachea-tuhe is retained until the patient can breathe through the glottis Avith ease.CHAPTER LX. —»— OPERATIOi^S ON THE AIR-TUBE AND ON THE CHE8T. LARYNGOTOMY AND TRACHEOTOMY. The -windpipe may either require to be opened to allow the formation of a temporary breathing apertm’e, in consequence of the obstruction of the lar}mx by causes that are speedily removable ; or it may be necessary to establish a permanent opening in the air-passage in those forms of chronic laryngeal disease, in which the obstruction depends upon organic alterations of structure which are not remediable. Among the conditions requhing temporary aperture, may be mentioned all ucute inflammatory affections of the larynx that give rise to obstructive oedema •of the glottis ; also traumatic conditions, such as the impaction of masses of food in the gullet, inducing asphyxia, and not capable of being immediately removed ; scalds of the rima glottidis ; the presence of foreign bodies in the air- passage ; and oedema of the glottis from wounds of the thyio-hyoid membrane. The estabhshment of a permanent aperture in the air-passage is especially required in chronic diseases of the larynx, attended by thickening of the mucous membrane, by abscess, or by necrosis of the cartilages—in fact, by any such conditions as do not admit of removal; so also, in cases of epithehoma or warty growth of the larynx, a permanent opening below the obstructed point may be required. Opening the Windpipe in Croup and Diphtheria.—The question as to whether the windjDipe should be opened in cases of Croup has been much dis- cussed. Were croup merely a disease of the larynx, and did death in it result from simple laryngeal obstruction, it would doubtless ofteu be proper to per- form this operation. But in crouj) there are two distinct soiu’ces of dauger : 1, that arising from asphyxia dependent on laryngeal inflammation, obstruction by plastic deposits, and spasm ; and 2, that which is due to the extension of inflammatory action below the larynx into the bronchi and lungs. By tracheotomy we can doubtless remove so much of the danger as arises from the laryngeal obstruction, but we cannot remove that which is dependent on the often concomitant broncho-pneumonia. In this respect, the propriety of performing tracheotomy in the croup of children differs remarkably from the expediency of having recourse to the same operation in the acute laiyngitis ot adults, in which the lungs are rarely implicated to a serious extent. In feet, the question as to the performance of tracheotomy in the croup of children must be answered by the amount of laryngeal asphyxia and the extent of pulmonary implication. If the child be in danger of death from imcom- plicated laryngeal inflammation, obstruction, and spasm, timely tracheotomyOPENING THE WINDPIPE IN DIPHTHERIA. 557 will nntloubtecUy rcsciie it from this immediate danger, and Avill be a proper- operation ; bnt, if extensive broncho-pulmonary inflammation already exist, it will lie worse than useless, and should on no account be practised. A serious objection to the performance of tracheotomy in the croup of young children s, that it is by no means an easy operation or one devoid of immediate danger. If chloroform be not given, the struggles and ivrithings of the child will materially embarrass the Surgeon in his attempts at opening the windpipe. But even if chlorofonn be administered, which should always be done when practicable, and this source of difficulty removed, there is, unless care betaken,, no little danger of luomon-hage ; and I have heard of several cases in which this has occun-ed to a fatal extent. Although, therefore, as a general rule, I fullv agree with Porter in reprobating this in ordinary cases of cioup, yet cases' are doubtless occasionally met with, in which the disease is so clearly limited to the larynx—the respiration being free throughout the lungs and bronchi that the Surgeon may feel himself justified in endeavouring to save the little patient, struggling against overpowering asphyxia, by opening the windpipe. In several such cases, to which I have been called by other practitioners, and Avhich were apparently most favourable to the operation, I have considered myself justified in doing this, though rarely mth ultimate success. I believe- that the general experience of British Surgeons is unfavourable to the opera- tion. On the other hand the French Sm-geons, and more particularly Trous- seau, arc strenuous advocates for the performance of tracheotomy in croup, and the operation is accordingly far more extensively practised in France than in this countiy. But even in Paris it is not a very successful procedure ; thus it appears that, at the Hospital for Sick Children in that city, the operation was performed in 215 cases in five years, and that of these only 47 were ciu’ed. Unless we assume that the disease, as occurring in Paris, is different from the form of croup we meet -with here, it may fairly be doubted whether an opera- tion which is in itself dangerous could be necessary in many of these in- stances, and whether a large proportion of the children might not have- recovered under ordinary medical treatment and without having recourse to- surgical operation. In Diphtheria, as in croup, there are several sources of danger. There is. not only pei-il from the obstruction of the pharyirx and larynx, by inflammation and the accumulation of exudation-matter, to such an extent as to indirce asphyxia, but there is also liability to pulmonary inflammation and congestion,, blood-poisoning, and exhaustion of the system. In diphtheria, as in croup, the windpipe may be opened when the patient is in imminent danger of death from la-ryngeal obstmetion ; and the fatal event may be warded off so far as it arises from this cause, and time be then afforded for proper treatment. F^en though the relief afforded by operation be only temporary in the- majority of cases, and the patients generally eventually die of the constitu- tional symptoms, yet it is obviously proper in cases still uncomplicated, and ■\yhere the danger of death from laryngeal asphyxia is’ imminent, that the- Surgeon should rescue the patient from its instant peril, and give him his only chanee of prolonging or of preserving life, by opening the windpipe, the trachea in children, the larynx in adults, being most suitable for operation. It has been very justly observed by Sir W. Jenner that, by opening the wind-5SS OPERATIONS ON THE AIR-TUBE AND CHEST. pipe in these cases, avc save the patient from so terrible a death as that by asphj-xia; and, even if life be nltimately extinguished by the disease, temporary ease will have been afforded the patient, and death will occur in a less distress- ing manner ; and that, if only one life in a hundred could in this way lie saved, Ave should be justified in having recourse to the operation. Sir N. Jenner has made the important observation, that if the larynx be not invaded by the end of the first Aveek, so as to require the Avindpipe to be opened, laryngeal obstruction rarely if ever occiu’s. The prospect of saving life after opening the windpipe in cases of diphthe- ritic asphyxia Avill greatly depend upon the age of the patient. Under two or even three years of age, recovery is extremely rare; as age advances, the chance of life proportionately increases, and in adults the prospect of recovery is considerable. In many cases the patient Avill get great temporary benefit from the operation, and Avill appear to be doing well for several days, perhaps for eight, ten, or foiu-teen ; and then, to the great disappointment of the Surgeon, he will die, not from the effects of the operation, but from blood-poisoning or from the extension of the disease to the bronchi and lunss. After operations of laryngotomy or tracheotomy in croup and diphtheria, it is a question how long the tube should be left in. As a general rule, I think from three to four days are sufficient, care being taken to cleanse it thoroughly ! during this period. After Avithdrawal, respiration Avill in a great measure be carried on through the apertm-e, AA^hich aaiU not gradually close. Should this ■prove insufficient, the tube may always be inserted again. Occasionally false membranes are expelled, or may be withdrawn from the opening in the Avind- pipe ; and through it the interior of the larynx may be sponged out Avith solu- tion of nitrate of silver, if thought desirable. No patient ought ever to be allowed to die fr-om simple laryngeal obstruction, whether that be spasmodic or dependent on organic disease, Avithout an attempt being made to save life by opening the windpipe. It is as impermissible for a Surgeon to alloAv a patient to die of laryngeal asphyxia Avithout an attempt at relief by opening the windpipe, even though life appear to be extinct, as it would be to let him die of haemorrhage without attempting to contract the hleeding vessel. Necessity for Promptitude.—When it has been determined to open the windpipe for acute disease, more especiailly supervening on chronic lai-yngitis, ■the less delay there is in having recourse to operation, the better; as the patient may at any moment be seized Avith laryngeal spasm, and be canied oif. The operation ought always, hoAvever, to be completed, even though the patient have apparently expired before the windpipe has been opened; for resuscitation may, even in these extreme cases, be effected by artificial respiration. Wien life hangs on so slender a thread as it does in m-gent cases of laryngeal obstruc- tion, the first touch of the knife may cause a spasmodic seizure that may give rise to apparent death. It has tAAUce happened to me to operate under such circumstances, and in both cases to be fortunate enough to save the patient’s life. In one case to Avhich I Avas called many years ago by my fr-ieud kir. E. Baker, the patient, an elderly Avoman, Avas apparently dying fr-om the supervention of acute upon chi-onic laryngeal disease. I lost no time m making an incision into the crico-thyroid membrane, but at the first touch ofOPERATIONS FOR OPENING THE WINDPIPE. 559 the knife she sank bank, apparently dead. I immediately completed the opej tion a^ introdneed a large silver tnbe, throngh n-hich the kings were mflated; in the coni-se of a few minutes, the action of the heart recommenced, and the patient eventually recovered. She has never, however, been able to breathe without the silver tube, which she wears in her windpipe up to the present time In another case to which I was hastily simimoned by my fiiend Mr Tweed I found the patient, a young woman, in the last stage of asphyxia from acute disease of the larynx. I immediately proceeded to operate, wth the assistance of my then house-surgeon, now the Professor of Chmeal Surgery at Edinburo-h j\Ir. luster. As the patient’s neck was short and thick, and the veins excessively’turgid, there was profuse hemorrhage on the first incisions being made • while we were waiting a minute or two until this would cease before opciiiuo- the windpipe, the patient fell back and apparently expired. I lost no time in plunging the scalpel into the crico-thyroid membrane, and cutting down through the cricoid cartilage, so as to make a fr-ee aperture into the air- passage. On endeavouring to set up artificial respiration, I foiind^ the chest clogged with inspissated mucus, which prevented the entrance of air into the lungs ; the life of a fellow-creature being at stake, and dependent on the immediate and full estabhshment of artificial respiration, I felt that there was only one thing to be done—to empty the chest of the matters loading it, and that this must be done instantaneously. I accordingly applied my lips to the wound, and sucked out three or fom- mouthfuls of blood and mucus, when I had the satisfaction to see that air could be made to enter the lungs. By keeping up artificial respiration for some time, the heart began feebly to act, the face to become less livid, and the circulation to be re-established; the patient eventually did well, and is now alive and in good health. Operation's.—In opening the windpipe, the Siugeon has the choice of two situations in which he may make the aperture ; either in the crico-thyroid membrane by Laryngotomy, or hi some part of the trachea by Tracheotomy. Besides these two estabhshed operations, some Siugeons have performed a third—Laryngo-tracheotomy, by opening the crico-thyroid membrane, and diidding the cricoid cartilage with the upper rings of the trachea. Whichever operation is performed, so soon as the windpipe is opened, the patient is seized with an attack of spasm and convulsive cough, often attended by much struggling and distress, during which the whistling occasioned by the passing of the air through the new passage is very loud and marked. The patient, however, soon recovers himself, and then breathes naturally and easily, the signs of asphyxia disappearing. The windpipe may require to be opened either by laryngotomy or trache- otomy for the following conditions (L = Laryngotomy : T = Tracheotomy):— 1. Acute laryngitis with oedema of the glottis in the adult (L). 2. Chronic oedema of the glottis with suffocating spasms (L). 3. Syphilitic or other ulcerations of the glottis with chronic oedema (L). 4. Croup in children (T). i). Diphtheria in children (T); in adults (L). G.

IjARYITQOTOj^’ is an easy operation. The crico-thyroid membrane is almost subcutaneous, and may readily be reached by making a vertical incision in the mesial line, between the sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles, about an inch in length, and then a cross cut through the membrane -with an ordinary scalpel. The air-passage having thus been opened, a silver tube, curved on the flat, may be readily introduced and retained by tapes round the neck. The only trouble- some result that can occur in this operation is the woimd of a small artery, the crico-thyroid branch of the superior thyroid, which crosses the membrane. I have never seen any trouble arise from this ; but, should it occm-, the hemor- rhage would readily be arrested by the application of pressure or hgature. Tracheotomy consists in making an opening into some part of the trachea, , hy exposing the tube and cutting across two or three of its rings. ' In performing tracheotomy, the patient’s shoulder should be supported with pillows, and his head be thromi as much back as practicable. An incision about an inch and a half in length should then be made with a scalpel directly in the ' mesial line, fr’om the cricoid cartilage downwards. After dividing the integu- J ments, any veins that present themselves should be avoided as carefully as- * possible, being held aside with a blunt hook. By using the point of the scalpel thi'ec of them (Fig. 047). The tube must then be tapes round the neck.

It shoifld then be transflxed and drawn forwards by a sharp hook, and opened by push- ing the point of the knife, with its back turned to- wards the sternum, between two of the rings, and cut- ting upwards through about introduced, and retained by561 DIFFICULTIES IN TRACHEOTOMY. The question as to the safety of the administration of chloroform in these operations often ocem-s. I believe that it may always be given safely except in cases of extreme syncopal asphyxia, where, as sensibility no longer exists, it is unnecessary. Laryngeal inflammation and obstruction are always associated with so much spasm, more pai-ticularly in children, that it will often be found that the patient respires more easily and fully whilst under the influence of chloroform than before its inhalation was commenced ; and, as the anmsthesia materially focilitates the operation by doing away with his VTithings and stragglings, I now in'^'ariably have recourse to it when I perform tracheo- tomy on children. In laiyngotomy in the adult it does not appear to me to be necessary. Difficulties.—This operation is often attended by extreme difficulty, and not unfi'equently by much danger. The difficulties occurring in tracheotomy are chiefly referable to four heads ; 1. Difficulty in Exposing the Trachea ; 2. Profuse Haemorrhage ; 3. Difficulty in Opening the Trachea; and 4. Trouble in Introducing the Trachea-tube. 1. The difficulty in Exposing the Trachea increases greatly as the inci- sions approach the sternum, and is especially great in children and in stout short-necked persons. There are three situations in which the trachea may be opened; either above, underneath, 01 below the isthmus of the thyroid body, which usually crosses the air-tube opposite its third or fourth ring. Above the isthmus, the trachea is comparatively superfleial, and is not covered by any venous plexus, nor does any other source of difficulty present itself to the’Surgeon. Where the isthmus crosses the trachea, this tube is overlaid by a venous plexus as well as by the glandular structure. Below the thyi'oid gland, the air-tube is overlapped by the stemo-hyoid and sterno-thyi'oid muscles, and by the inferior thyi'oid veins, which are of large size, together with some tracheal branches from the inferior thyroid artery; and not unfrequently an irregular arterial branch ^cends in this situation in front of the trachea to supply the thyroid body The carotid arteries also are in close relation to the trachea on each side • and opposite the epistemal notch it is crossed by the left carotid and by the mnominata, which vessel has been seen by Macilwain to cross the tube at the vep^ point where tracheotomy is usually performed. A glance at these import- ant relations wiU suffice to indicate the difficulty that must, in many cLs occur in exposing and opening the trachea. This difficulty is greatly increased Tb«r neck have become turgid in consequence of the pulmonic obstruction It will also be seen that the trachea is less covered md mav SrXoffi oT reached above, than below, the isthmus of recomili hf ■ Sm-geons, as Velpeau, for instance, have recommended the opening to be made m the lower, part of the tube no advan trv eloing, whilst the difficulties of the operation are aery seriously increased ; and in practice it is almost invariably opraed at 'itsOPERATIONS ON THE AIR-TUBE AND GUEST. 562 the bleeding from other sources. When it occurs, it chiefly happens fi-om the wound of some anomalous branch, or from that of tlie small tracheal vessels, Desault has, however, mentioned a fatal case, in which death arose fr-om a Avound of the carotid. The arterial anastomosis of the isthmus of the thyroid body may, if this part be enlarged, occasion some difficulty in the performance of the operation ; but the main source of danger unquestionably proceeds from the venous Ueeding. Not only are the plexuses of veins of large size, more particularly where they cover the lower part of the trachea, but they become immensely gorged by the asphyxia that necessitates the operation. Hence, when they are wounded, the bleeding may be so abundant as scarcely to be controllable, and may very greatly retard the after-steps of the operation. Many Surgeons of authority in these matters advise that the Avindpipe should j not be opened until all, or nearly all, the bleeding has ceased ; lest the blood, entering the bronchi and lungs through the aperture, asphyxiate the patient, j But in this way much valuable time may be consumed, and the patient may be ; fatally exhausted by a tedious and prolonged operation, and by the loss of an unnecessarily large quantity of blood. The haemorrhage in this operation is almost entirely venous, and is, in a great measure, dependent on the distension of the veins of the neck, which occurs in asphyxia as the result of the accumu- lation of blood in the right cavities of the heart, consequent upon the obstructed circulation through the lungs ; and the bleeding aauII continue so long as that obstruction remains unmoved. But as the respiratory process is re-estabhshed, this obstruction to the puhnonic circulation diminishes, the cardiac cavities become unloaded, the venous turgescence of the neck subsides, and the hsem- orrhage proportionately lessens. This I have repeatedly found in asphyxia ' artificially induced in animals ; and I have often seen it in the human subject, ^ in cases in which it has become necessary to open the Avindpipe at once, Avithout waiting to arrest haemorrhage. Hence, except in those instances in which an arterial tAvig or large venous trunk has been Avomided, and which must of course be secured, the occurrence of bleeding, though tolerably smart, need not deter the Surgeon from opening the windpipe; as the relief ' afforded to respiration will induce a corresponding and rapid diminution in the venous tmgescence of the neck, and in the consequent flow of blood from the wound. 3. Another difficulty in tracheotomy sometimes attends the process ot Opening the Trachea after it is exposed. In consequence of the convulsive breathing of the patient, the sterno-mastoids are put upon the stretch, thus increasing considerably the depth of the wound in the neck ; and, at each short and gasping respiration, the air-tube is rapidly pumped or jerked to and fro, approaching to and receding fr’om the surface in such a way that the scalpel cannot be thrust into it with safety. In order to do this Avith the least risk.

By means of an instrument of this kind, the E trachea is first fixed and then divided without danger to the patient, ' The danger from haemorrhage, and the difficulty in opening the trachea, arc i much gi-eater in children than in adults. Before the age of puberty, this tube is \ deeply seated, covered -with a quantity of loose granular fat, containing many I veins, and is of small size, so that a slight deviation of the incision to one side 3 or the other may readily lead the Sui-geon astray, and into dangerous proximity I with the carotid artery. , 4. After the trachea has been opened, the next point is to Introduce a : proper Tube. In doing this, special care must be taken not to push the tube I into a sort of pouch which always exists at the lower angle of the woimd, between I the trachea and the deep fascia of the neck. This error is not only embarrassing I in the highest degree to the Surgeon, but dangerous to the patient by the delay I it occasions, by the compression exercised on the trachea below the opening 5 into it, and by the suction of blood into the aperture in the air-tube. It is I best avoided by expanding the tracheal opening with the dilator (Fig. 652), and * passing the tube between the blades of that instrument. In the first instance, - a tube of a conical shape should be employed, as it is not only introduced more ^1 readily than a cylindrical one, but fills up completely the aperture in the J f di-aming of blood into the lungs. In passino- the i tube into the rachea some difficulty may be experienced, owing to the elasMcitv .f the sides of the incision in the windpipe, in consequence If M5^4 OPERATIONS ON THE AIR-TUBE AND GUEST. them is apt to ho doubled in under the cud of the instrument. This may j^e avoided by the use of Fuller’s bivalve tube introduced closed (Fig. CnO), and then expanded by slipping a cannula into it (Fig. Of)!); or one side of tlie cut in the trachea may be held aside with the forceps or a blunt hook, whilst the tube is slipped under the other. If the rings of the trachea be very rigid and miyielding, the silver tube may most conveniently be introduced by expandin<»- the incision by means of the trachea-forceps (Fig. {NI2), and then passing it between or under their blades. Some Surgeons prefer, instead of the scalpel, to open the trachea with cutting forceps, or with a trochar carrying a cannula in the shape of a trachea-tube, which is then left in the air-passage ; these instruments, though ingenious and in some respects useful, do not appear to me to be so safe or easy of management, especially in children, as the scalpel and trachea-hook. Tracheotomy in Children is never an easy, and is at times a dangerous operation. The difficulty of the operation arises more particularly in infants and very young children from the shortness of the neck, the depth and small size of the trachea, and the quantity of granular areolo-adipose tissue lying over it. The danger of the operation results from the large size of the venous plexus in connection with the thyroid body, and the proximity of the carotids. In performing this operation in young subjects, chloroform should always be ad- I ministered. This may be done with safety, even though the most m’gent asphyxia | be present; the difficulty of respiration, being in a great measure spasmodic, is reheved by the anaesthetic. If chloroform be not given, the struggles of the child will seriously embarrass the operator, and add much to the danger of the operation. The incision must be very carefully placed on the mesial line ; and after the fascia of the neck has been opened, the knife should be used as sparingly as possible, and the tissues rather pushed and held aside Avith a director. The trachea, when exposed, must be raised up by transfixion -v^th the director-hook and carefully opened, the knife being neither thrust so deep as to wound the posterior part, nor turned laterally. As soon as the trachea is opened, the tube should be introduced; and this step of the operation is greatly facilitated by holding the trachea well up and drawing it forward vuth the hook. When the tube is fairly in, the hook must be withdrawn. Comparison of Tracheotomy and Laryngotomy.—On comparing tracheo- tomy, as ordinarily performed, with laryngotomy, I think there can be little doubt that the Surgeon should give the preference, in all cases where it is prac- ticable, to the latter operation, on account of its greater simplicity, safety, and rapidity. In all cases in which the obstruction to respiration is produced by inflammatoiy effusion into the submucous areolar tissue, whether depeudeiit upon idiopathic or erysipelatous laryngitis, oedema glottidis, or chronic disease of the larynx, or upon the irritation and infiammation excited by swallowing boiling water or the stronger acids, the swelling, for reasons that have afready been mentioned, never extends below the true vocal cords ; hence an opening i into the crico-thyinid membrane will always be below the seat of obstruction. An objection, it is true, has been urged to laryngotomy in these cases, that it docs not allow the patient to wear a tube without much irritation being ^ induced. This, however, I have not found to be the case in my practice, i j have had patients Avho have worn silver tubes in this situation a consic eia e jtracheotomy and LARYNGOTOMY compared. 565 number of years, in one case as many as twelve, and in whom no special iiTita- tion lias been occasioned by them. When the windpipe recpiircs to be opened for the extraction of a foreign body, traclieotomy should be performed ni pre- ference to laryngotomy, as the latter operation docs not admit of suftcient space for its expulsion or extraction. In children the larynx is so little I developed, that tracheotomy becomes necessaiy. ^ In my opinion, laryngotomy is the operation that should, in cases such as ! aboA-e mentioned, be preferred in the adult; and this opinion is based on the I following reasons. 1. As ill laryngotomy the air-tube is always opened below the seat of obstruc- : tion, there can be no necessity to make an apertm-e farther from the seat of 1 disease. In laryngitis, whether that affection assume the acute or the chronic ; character, the obstruction to breathing is in a great measure mechanical, and [ depends upon the iiiiiltratioii of the submucous areolar tissue of the larynx, I and partly of the large plane of this tissue, which lies behind the box of the I larynx, and ivhich, by expanding, as it were, into the pharynx, obstructs deglu- ; titioii, and afterwards, by the extension of this swelling and infiltration to the I lips of the glottis and the interior of the larynx, causes an impediment to the 1* entrance of air into the bronchi. But, as has been pointed out by Prescott Heivett, this submucous areolar tissue terminates at the true vocal cords, where the mucous membrane becomes directly applied to the subjacent fibrous struc- tures ; the swellmg and consequent mechanical impediment are hence confined to the limits of the thyroid cartilage, and any opening made below this vdll clear the loAvest limit of the disease, Avhich is always acciu’ately and almost mathe- matically bounded below by the vocal cords. Hence an aperture in the crico- thyroid membrane is quite as effectual as one in the trachea. 2. Lai’yngotomy is a far safer operation than tracheotomy. On this point I need scarcely dwell; a glance at the anatomy of the parts concerned wiU be sufficient to establish it. The crico-thyroid membrane is nearly subcutaneous, and no parts of importance can be wounded in opening it, if Ave except the small crico-thyroid artery AA'hich crosses it, and which might be cut across, but fr’om which I have never seen any trouble arise. The trachea, on the con- trary, is not only deeply seated, but covered by a large plexus of blood-vessels, Avhich, Avhen rendered tm-gid by the asphyxiated condition that exists when an operation is required, pours out a large quantity of dai'k blood, and thus seriously embarrasses and delays the Surgeon at a time when the life of the patient depends on the speedy admission of air to his lungs. 3. Laryngotomy can be much more quickly performed than tracheotomy. This I look upon as an inestimable advantage in many of the cases requiring I operation; a foAV seconds more or less being sufficient to turn the balance t either in favom of life or of death. The rapidity with AALich laryngeal obstruction • —partly mechanical and partly from spasm—sets in, is sometimes so groat, I more particularly Avheu an acute inflammation supervenes on chronic disease of the larynx, that life may be extinguished before the Sm-geon has time to open the Avindpipe, if he endeavour to do so by tracheotomy. In extreme cases, as Avhere the lungs have become slowly engorged, the action of the heart is already enfeebled, and a sudden spasm occim-ing at the glottis, will at once place the patient beyond recovery. But even though life appeal- for the moment extinct.566 OPERATIONS ON THE AIR-TUBE AND CHEST. it is tlie imperative duty of the Surg-eon to open the air-passage fus speedily as possible, and to endeavour, by means of artificial respiration, to recall the bickering spark ; and it is impossible to experience a greater satisfaction in the exercise of our profession, or to witness a gi*eater triumph of art, than in thus snatching a patient out of the very jaws of death. Laryngotomy should, therefore, be practised on the adult in impending asphyxia from the following causes 1. Acute laryngitis; 2. Erysipelatous laryngitis—oedema glottidis ; 3. Chronic ulceration and disease of the larynx ; 4. Scald of the pharynx, &c., from swallowing con-osive liquids ; 5. Spasm from iwessm-e on the recuiTent laryngeal nerve ; 0. Diphtheritic exudation. Tracheotomy should, as a general rule, he prefen’ed in children, and should be performed on them for obstruction to respiration from—1. Croupy exuda- tion ; 2. Diphtheritic effusion ; 3. Swallowing boiling water ; 4. Foreign bodies in the air-passage of adult as well as child ; 5. Impaction of food, &c., i in the phaiynx. Trachea-tubes should be of such a calibre throughout as to admit of respi- I’ation being carried on though them, without any effort on the part of the patient. Many of those that are to be met udth in the instnunent-makers’ shops, though very wide at the mouth, are far too naiTOw and contracted at the i lower aperture to aUow a free and unimpeded passage for the air of respiration, j being made very conical in order to admit of easy introduction, and to occlude completely the opening in the -windpipe, so as to prevent the entry of any blood ^ by the side of the tube. The disadvantage attending this mode of construction may in a great degree be remedied, by having a longitudinal opening like the | large eye of a catheter cut in the side of the tube, immediately above the inferior aperture. One great difficulty which the Surgeon has to meet in cases of tracheotomy or laryngotomy, is to keep the tube from being clogged and obstructed by mucus. ! It is usually stated that the tube may be kept clear by the occasional introduc- i tion of a feather’, of a piece of sponge fixed to a stick, or a bit of lint -wrapped round a probe. In this way it is trrre that the frothy or spumous mrreus that collects irr the trrbe may be readily errough cleared away ; bVit this simple means will in very many cases be found to be quite ineffectual in removing another kind of mucus that in certain conditions rapidly accrrmulates to a considerable extent -withirr the tube. On examirrirrg a trachea-tube that has been worn for but a few horrrs, it -\nll be found that its interior becomes gradually lined by a coating of dr-y, grrmmy, and very tenacious muerrs, which is so fir-mly adherent to the metal as to render it necessary, before the tube can be properly cleaned, to detach this lining by means of a pen-knife or pointed probe ; or, what is better, by pom’ing boiling water through the tube. Hhis tenacious mucus, col- lecting in largest quantity at the inferior aperture, and at the cur^'e of the trachea-tube, may block up its calibre to a very gi-eat and dangerous extent, whilst the mouth of the tube appears to be perfectly perdous and free ; though ' feathers and pieces of stick armed with sponge or lint have been introduced fr’om time to time, these, passing over thi^ dry mucus, are quite miable to detach it from the side of the tube, and merely bring away the sputa and more fr’othy mucus. . . , Obre devised a very simple means to remedy this inconvenience. It consists567 trachea-tubes. ?n Hip finchea-tube bein" made of uniform calibre throughout, and having an interior tube‘accurately fitted to it, and projecting about one-eighth of an inch V. flip imvpr extremity of the outer tube. It is in the projection of the Lterlal tube beyond the lower end of the external one that the great utility onhfcoiitrivance consists. If the two tubes be of the same long h^^ or still more, if the innermost tube be the shorter, a plug of mucus may be left at the end of the outer cannula, on the withdrawal of the inner tube But if this be the longer of the two, the end of the outer tube wiU be effectually cleared every time it is withdrawn, which may be done as often as any mucus coUects, without in the slightest degree disturbing the patient. The two tubes are fixed by means of a button, attached to the edge of the outer one (Figs. 600, C54) The bivalye trachea-tube (Figs. 650, 651) is constructed on the same Fig. 653.—Trachea-tube, Side l iew. Fig. 654.—Trachea-tube, Front view. principle, the inner tube being longer than the outer; and it possesses the additional advantage of being readily removed for the pui-poses of cleaning, and as easily replaced. When used for lai-yngotomy, the tube may con- veniently be curved on the flat (Fig. 655); the longest diameter being lateral instead of antero-posterior, thus being adapted to the form of the aperture in the crico-thyroid membrane. It sometimes happens that, in consequence of the tube becoming detached from the shield, it slips into the trachea, where it acts as a foreign body. Cases of this kind have been related by Walters of Reigate, and by J. W. Ogle of St. George’s Hospital. The removal of the tubes was effected by means of tracheotomy. For the prevention of such an accident, it has been suggested that the trachea-tube should be formed in one piece, instead of in two pieces soldered together. AVhen a trachea-tube has been worn for any length of time, it will almost always be found that ulceration has taken place in the trachea at some point as the result of pressure. The discharge from this ulcerating surface, and the increased secretion caused by the accompanying irritation, add greatly to the difficulty experienced in keeping the tube from becoming choked. To over- come these difficulties, Mon’ant Baker, of St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, has employed a tube made of India-rubber, such as is used in the manu- facture of the India-rubber catheter. It has sufficient rigidity to prevent its collapsing, but not sufficient to give rise to irritation or to cause ulceration. It is to be introduced after the first twenty-four hours, a silver tube being568 OPERATIONS ON THE AIR-TUBE AND CHEST. used till then. The tube is single, but the ease with which it can be removed and re-introduced is so great, that there is no difficulty in keeping it clean ; in fact the irritation produced in so doing is said to bo less than that caused by the removal of the inner tube of any ordinary double trachea-tube. Mr. Baker has found, from experience in a considerable number of cases, that it is worn Avith much greater comfort to the patient than a rigid tube. Trendelenburg’s Operation.—An ingenious and useful application and modification of tracheotomy has been devised by Trendelenburg and adopted by Langenbeck, in cases of operation about the jaws, palate, and pharynx, in which danger might arise from the inspiration of blood into the air-passage. The entrance of blood into the air-tube during these operations is dangerous, both directly, by the risk of suffocation; and also indirectly, by the blood finding its way into the air-cells, there coagulating, and thus disposing to bronchitis or pneumonia, a danger that is greatly increased by the inhalation of the breath loaded Avith septic influences from the suppurating and sloughy sur- faces of the wound. With the view of obAnating these dangers, Trendelenburg proposes the following operation. The patient having been placed under the influence of cliloroform, tracheotomy is performed in the usual Avay above the thyroid body. A trachea-tube fltted with a hollow India-rubber coUar (Fig. G56, 1) is then introduced, and the inhalation of the antesthetic vapour can-ied on through it by attaching, by means of an India-rubber tube, a funnel containing a sponge (Fig. 650, 2). When the Surgeon is about to commence Fig. 656.—Treuileleuburg’s Tracliea-Tampon. 1. Tlie Trachea-tube and Collar slightly 3. The Inflating Bottle attached inflated. 2. The Inhaling Funnel to the CoUar on Trachea-tube. his operation, the collar is inflated by means of the India-rubber ball attached (Fig 656 3) • the effect being to close the larynx above the tube, and thus to cut off aU possibihty of blood finding its way down the larynx into the bronchi and air-ceUs. After the operation is completed, the “ trachea-tampon is removed, and an ordinary trachea-tube is substituted and retained as long as it may be thought necessary.TAPPING THE CHEST. 569 TAPPINa THE CHEST 0 io a 5 9 1 Tapping the Pleural Cavity.—The operation of Tapping the Pleural Cavity is required in cases of hydrothorax, empyema, and hiemothorax. The point of selection is a spot in the fifth intercostal space on the lateral median line. This point is crossed by a line drawn horizontally round the body from the nipple to the spine. The chest-wall is here thinner than elsewhere, and the trochar at once perforates the intercostal muscles. The operation may be done by an ordinary trochar. But as it is of great I ^ Fig. 057.—Pistoii-Trocliar for Tiippiug the Chest. importance in cases of hydrothorax to exclude the air fr’om the pleural sac, it is usual to employ a trochar so constructed as to accomphsh this end. The Piston-trocliar (Fig. G57), or the one represented below (Fig. 058), may be i Fig. 058.-napping the Cliest hy the Suction-Troclmr. mplojed_ WhichcTcr instrument is used, the operation should be done ows. The skm haring been punctured by a scalpel, the point of the troch57° OPERATIONS ON THE AIR-TUBE AND CHEST. is slipped OA'er the upper margin of the sixth rib into the middle of the fifth intercostal space, and thrust sharply and firmly into the pleural sac, so as to make siu'e of penetrating the thickened pleura and any layers of false membrane which, if the instrument were pushed slowly on, might he thrust before it (Fig. G58). If the “ piston-trochar ” (Fig. 057) be used, the tap should be closed as the stylet is withdrawn, and an India-rubber tube attached to the end of the cannula. The tap being then opened, the fluid flows along this into a jar containing water. Or the Suction-trocliar may be used (Fig. 058), the chest fluid being allowed to rmi off by the elastic tube, the end of which is immersed in water. A third method of tapping the chest is by means of the Aspirator (Fig. 050). The air having been exhausted from the bottle and the stop-cock closed, the fig. 059.—Taijping the Chest hy the Asiiirator. chest is tapped in the usual situation with the aspirator-troohar ; and tie coo • on its side being turned on, the fluid rushes into the exhausted bottle to flU up the vacuum. The] quantity drawn off is often very great, several pints from the adult; and even in children the amount of fluid may be immenM.

The forcible expansion under these circumstances might gi\-e rise to haemorrhage. One stop-cock c, as re])resentcd in the drawing (Fig. G()0), closes both tubes. The piston A being withdrawn, and a vacuum so produced, the cock c is turned so that it is parallel to the syringe, and the vacuum is thus put in connection with the needle n. While doing this, the small cock at e must be closed. If it be determined to use the ajjparatus as a syjjhon, the cock e must be opened, and the handle of the piston forced do^m so as to fill a long tube passing downwards from E. The cock c now being turned olf, the fluid will continue to flow.

In hydrolhoral572 OPERATIONS ON THE AIR-TUBE AND CHEST. llO^YevGl•, it is of grccit consequence to prevent the entrance of air ; and hero every precaution to this end shonld he taken. Drainage-Tubes.—Goodfellow and De Morgan have advantageously adopted the use of Chassaignac’s drainage-tubes in the treatment of empyema, with the view of preventing the accumulation of pus, its fetid decomposition, and conse- quent irritative fever, and of allowing the gradual expansion of the previously comimessed Imig, or collapse of the chest-wall. The mode of introducing the drainage-tubes into the pleural sac, adopted by De Morgan, is the following. A puncture with a trochar having been made in the usual situation between the fifth and sixth ribs, a long iron j)robe, slightly bent, is passed through this opening, and pushed downwards and backwards. It is then made to press against the thoracic wall at its lower and posterior part; and, being felt through the intercostal space, it is cut down upon, and its end exposed. A silk thread carrying the drainage- tube is now passed through the eye of the probe ; and as this is drawn out at the lower opening, the thread and tube necessarily follow. The ends of the tube projecting fii-om the opposite openings are then tied together, leading the body of the tube in the pleural sac. The pus drops out as it forms ; and thus the chest is kept empty by drainage through the tube and the lower counter-opening. Tapping the Pericardium.—In hydrops pericardii, attended with immi- nent danger of immediate death, it may be necessary to tap the pericardium. This may most safely be done by making an incision about half an inch in length through the skin and areolar tissue in the fifth nitercostal space, in the cardiac region, and then slowly and carefully introducing a fine trochar at that point where percussion and auscultation have indicated the greatest amount of fluid. The trochar should be passed obhquely; and, as soon as it appeal's to have entered the pericardium, the stylet should be sheathed and the cannula pushed forwards mitil the serum escapes. The operation is, however, much more safely done with the aspirator. From experiments made on the dead body, Dieulafoy concludes that the operation may be performed in the fomth or fifth interspace, the fifth being perhaps preferable, as it is nearer the apex of the heart and corresponds with a more dependent situation of the fluid. The puncture may be made from 2 to 2^ inches from the left margin of the sternum. The spot having been selected should be marked with ink. If the patient be anasarcous, the inter- space must be determined by carefully pressing away the oedema. The needle to be employed should vary with the case. If the diagnosis be certain, No. 2 (one miUimetre, or roughly inch in diameter), should be used; but if the diagnosis be uncertain. No. 1, half this size, should be chosen, as ivith this needle, it is said, the heart may be punctined ivith impmiity. The best form of aspirator to use is one such as is represented in Fig. GGO, as needles of such small size are apt to be plugged with small flakes of lymph, and if such an accident occin, they may be cleared again by reversing the syringe and forcing n smaU quantity of fluid back into the pericardium. Before using the aspirator, it should be carefully tested with some carbolised water to see that t e needle is pervious, and the whole apparatus in working oidei. Aiaciuim having been created in the aspirator by drawing back and fixing the piston.573 TAPPING THE PERICARDIUM. the needle is to be inserted at the spot determined on. As soon as the open- ing at the point of the needle is covered, the stop-cock leading to it is to be opened, so that the vacuum extends into the needle ; and “we now advance, vacuum in hand, in search of the effusion.” The needle must be pushed slowly and carefully onwards in a direction upwards and inwards till the fluid appears in the glass tube of the aspirator. The moment this occurs aU movement of the needle must cease, and it must be held steadily as long as the fluid con- tinues to floAv. Any unnecessary movement may scratch and injure the surface of the heart. If the flow cease suddenly as if from some obstruction, a little fluid may be forced back as above stated to clear the needle. After AvithdraAving the needle no dressing is required to the minute puncture. Over a pint of fluid has been removed by this means at one operation. In inserting the needle, care must be taken not to force it through a costal cartilage, or a small plug of cartilage may be cut out Avhich would effectually close its canal.574 DISEASES OF THE BREAST. CHAPTEE LXI. ' —♦— DISEASES OP THE BREAST. By Disease of the Breast is meant an affection of the mammary region, not merely of the mammaiy gland. These diseases may occm- in the male as weU as in the female. They are necessarily most frequent as ■well as most important in the latter, the rudimentary mammary gland of the male being little predisposed to such affections in comparison to the highly developed and active organ in the female. Diseases of the breast, when they occm- in the female, are of much interest to the Surgeon ; not only on account of their great variety, hut fr-om the difficulties attending then’ diagnosis, and from the importance attaching to the question of operative interference in connection with them. Diseases of the breast seldom occim before puberty, being most fr-equently met wdth either during lactation, when the functions of the gland are in a high degree of development; or towards the termination of menstrual hfe, when the actions of the organ are necessarily influenced by the changes that are taking place in the uterine system. But there is this important difterence between the diseases at these different periods of life, viz., that in the young they are of a simple, in the older woman frequently, if not generally, of a malignant nature. Just before or at puberty, the breast occasionally becomes the seat of inflammation and abscess ; in all probabihty O'wing to changes taking place in it in connection with the general development of the reproductive system. As the period of' puberty approaches, the breasts often swell, become hard, knotty, and somewhat painful, indicative of some commencing change in the generative system. In other cases again, a precocious hypertrophy may take place, frequently attended with severe neiu-algia in the part. When puberty occurs, the breasts naturally enlarge, and often become tender ; and occasionally one undergoes a certain degree of hypertrophy, increasing greatly in bulk beyond the other. These various changes, though exciting alarm in females, cannot be regarded as of any very serious importance, and seldom require more than the simplest surgical treatment. ANOMALIES OP DEVELOPMENT. The mammary gland is subject to certain anomalies as to development. Thus, in some instances it has been found to be altogeiher wanting. Sir A. Cooper and Froriep both relate instances in which the organ was not de- veloped, and in which the ovaries were also defleient. A more remarkable anomaly consists in the development of a number of Supernumerary Breasts. Birkett has collected fourteen reported cases, in which there wereNEURALGIA OF THE BREAST. 575 more than two breasts ; most frequently there is but one supcmuraerary gland, sometimes two ; and occasionally, though very rarely, three have been met wth, constituting quintuple mammm. Supernumerary Nipples have likewdse been found to occur ; two to each breast have been met with, each communicating with the gland, and passing milk. Most frequently the supemnniorary breast is situated somewhere in the neighbourhood of the normal gland, as on the anterior part of the thorax ; and where four are developed, they have been found placed in two parallel rows, one above the other. Occasionally they have been met with in very strange situations ; thus they have been seen on the outer part of the thigh, in the gi*oin, and on the back ; and children are even said to have been suckled by these abnormal breasts. NEUBALGIA. Neuralgia of the Breast occasionally occurs to so severe a degree as to constitute a positive disease, either in girls or at a more advanced period of life, when it not unfr’equently complicates other moi’C serious affections of this organ. It is especially apt to occur in young, delicate, unmarnded females of the hysterical temperament, though it is often met with in strong ruddy-looking women, who are perhaps subject to nem’algic pains in the back, and in other situations. Most commonly the catamenia wdll be found to be in’egular; and uterine congestion, inflammation, or ulceration, will be dis- covered on examination ; indeed, I have scarcely ever failed to detect one or other of these conditions in the uterus in cases of neuralgic breast. Symptoms.—In neiualgia of the breast, the mammary gland may be of its normal size and consistence ; but in some instances the Avhole of it is more or less indurated and hypertrophied. There are always much general pain and aching, deeply in its substance, wdth cutaneous tenderness of its surface, and lancinating or radiating sensations that extend into the axilla and down the arm. These painful sensations are commonly increased before the menstrual period, and not unfr’equently alternate in the two breasts. Diaynosis.—The diagnosis of this affection from more serious mammary disease may usually be effected by attending to the superficial and radiating character of the pain, to the temperament of the woman in whom it occurs, to its shifting seat, and to the absence of any positive signs of disease in the breast. Treatment.—The treatment consists especially in attention to the condition of the uterine organs ; unless this be done in a proper way, the disease wiU prove to be excessively rebellious and troublesome to manage. By using the speculum, however, when necessary, and removing by proper remedies any uterine irritation that may be found, this affection will be subdued wdth far greater readiness than by any local jdan of treatment. At the same time, •antihysterical constitutional remedies may be employed ; the preparations of iron administered, when necessary ; and the local pain relieved by the aiqjlica- tion of belladonna and opiate plasters, or by hypodermic injections of morphia.DISEASES OF THE BREAST. 576 HYPBRTROPHy. Simple Hypertrophy op the Breast is nob unfrcqucntly associated with very severe neuralgia of the organ. An increase of size, such as naturally takes place during pregnancy, between the fourth and ninth months, will occasionally commence at puberty, and go on until the organ attains an enormous bulk, as in Fig. OGl, which represents the breast of a very thin girl of fifteen, who was under my care for this condition. In some cases the breast has been found after death to weigh as much as twenty pounds ; and after re- moA’al, a breast of this kind, taken from a young woman under thirty, has weighed no less than twelve pounds, being entirely com- posed of its normal tissues, greatly hyper- trophied. In these cases of hypertrophy both breasts are usually affected, though one is commonly more so than the other. When first this morbid condition commences, the breast preserves its usual shape, though it is increased in bulk; but as it enlarges it gradually projects forwards, drawing down the skin of the shoulders, of the side of the chest, end even of the back, and hansdne: mentioned by Bdrard, it has been known to Pig. 661.—Simple Hypertropliy of Breast in a Girl filteen years old. downwards, until, as in a case reach to the knees. Treatment.—The treatment of this affection is very unsatisfactory. The general health must be attended to, and an endeavour may be made to excite lactation, and thus to unload the vessels of the breast by the employment of galactagogue remedies. Amputation of the organ should not be performed in these cases, unless the gToivth attain so great a size as to render life a burden. Then the mass may be extiiqiated with little trouble or danger. Lobular Hypertrophy op the Breast has been described by Sir A, Cooper as occurring chiefly in unmarried women between thirty and forty years of age. It appears on manipulation to be composed of several sohd but movable masses, wLich after a time begin to diminish in size, until the breast at last atrophies, and is in a great measure absorbed. It ivould appear to be rather a species of the chronic mammary tumour than a pure hypertrophy. ABNORMAL CONDITIONS OP THE LACTEAL SECRETION. The lacteal secretion is occasionally the cause of abnormal conditions in the ^ breast. Thus the milk may appear at unusual times, a twelvemonth, for instance, after iveaning ; it has occasionally been known to be secreted in children, and in some remarkable instances in boys and men. In other instances again, after parturition, there is a total Absence of Milk, either owing to Avant of development in the gland, or to debihty on the part of the577 INFLAMMATION OF THE BREAST. mother. The opposite condition will occasionally occur, and an Excessive Flow of Milk may continne, especially in hysterical females long after the child has been weaned. In such cases as these, the (jalactorrhma may be checked by the application of the extract of belladonna to the breast, aided by the employment of tonics, and the administration of acids. Lactelvl Tumour.—It may happen during lactation that one of the lactiferous ducts becomes obstructed, either by its being obliterated by in- flammation or occluded by the deposit in it of a small concretion—a lacteal calculus. In either case the walls or the duct may be expanded, so that at last it constitutes a moderate-sized cyst, fluctuating on pressure, and evidently containing fluid. In some cases, the lacteal tumour has been known to attain an enormous size. Walpy has related a case in which he drew off ten pounds of milk by tapping a collection of this kind. These tumour’s may exist for a considerable time. Dupuytren records an instance in which one had existed for ten months, and Cooper one of a year’s duration. In these chronic cases the milk usually undergoes changes, becoming creamy, thick, and oily ; and in some instances it would appear to leave a solid residue by the absorption of its watery parts. In other instances the milk appears as if diffused through the substance of the gland and its ducts, constituting a spongy semi-fluctuating tumour. Velpeau has pointed out that these lacteal deposits imdergo a series of changes, somewhat similar to those that take place in blood that has been extravasated ,• becoming absorbed in whole or part in some instances, in others remaining fluid, and occasionally becoming encysted. Treatment.—In these cases, the readiest mode of getting rid of the tumom- is, as Sir A. Cooper advises, to make an oblique puncture from the nipple towards it, by means of a trochar and cannula, so that a fistulous track may be left, along which the milk is discharged, and thus got rid of; the child being at the same time weaned, so that the secretion may cease. In some cases after weaning, the milk may be diffused into the substance of the gland, or collected into masses of curd, forming hard nodules, which give a good deal of trouble, and may eventually lead to some of the forms of inflammation that will immediately be described ; these swelhngs are usually best removed by ffictions with somewhat stimulating embrocations, such as camphorated oil, by which their absorption is promoted. INFLAMMATION OF THE BREAST. Inflammation of the Breast may take place at any period of life. In c ildhood It occurs as the result of accidental causes, just before or at puberty m boys as well as in girls, as a consequence of the general development of the organs of reproduction. But far more frequently it is the direct result of the exalted action taking place in the gland during laetation, which, in feeble and antemie women, runs beyond the boimds of a normal standard. It is commonly met with during the first month or two after the birth of the child, and seldom ocems during weaning, but may, as Nunn has shown, be the consequence S’ unduly prolonpd suckling, and thus appear at a late period-the enth or eleventh month. It ie most fteqnontly met ,vith in wcaki, anlic The mflammafon may atToct any one of the eonstitnonts of which Zb oaT^ composed, and may be limited to this ; thus it may take place in the^ “ e P PDISEASES OF THE BREAST. 578 ill the subcutaneous areolar tissue lying between the skin and the gland; in the gland itself ; or in that extensive plane of areolar membrane upon which the gland rests, and which intervenes between it and the pectoral muscle. But although the inflammation commonly alfects these difterent parts, in many cases the whole of the breast appears to be affected, and no distinct implication of any special tissue can be made out. Inflammation of the Nipple and Areola.—When the nipple and areola are inflamed, these parts become conical, red, and swollen, Avith much pain, owing to the density of the subcutaneous tissue in this situation. This affec- tion, “ the cracked nipple ” of nurses, usually occurs at an early period of lac- tation in dehcate women, and especially with the first child. It commeilces in the follicles of the part, being accompanied by superficial ulceration, abrasion, fissure, and cracks, with oozing of a small quantity of thin sero- puriform fluid, great pain during suckling—so great, indeed, as to prevent the proper continuance of this act; and usually attended by a good deal of con- stitutional irritation. In some instances, the fissiu’ed state of the nipple would appear to precede the setting in of inflammation ; in other cases, the inflam- mation is the primary condition. The Treatment is as follows. The child must be taken from the affected breast, both for its own sake and the mother’s, the milk being di-awn off" by means of a breast-pump or sucker. The general health must be attended to ; tonics given ; the infant’s mouth examined for aphthae, which, whether as cause or as effect, are common, and must be treated on ordinary medical prin- ciples. If the nipple be not fissured, it should be covered with flexible collo- dion, or painted with an astringent; a solution of nitrate of silver, catechu, or tannin is the beSt. If it be fissm-ed, a pointed stick of nitrate of silver must be apphed to the bottom of the crack daily, or it may, if deep, be divided by drawing a lancet along it. Abscess of the Areola not unfrequently ocem-s in suckling women, with the ordinary signs of local inflammation, terminating in circumscribed sup- puration. The Treatment consists in the application of warm belladonna or lead lotion, and lancing the part early. In doing this, care should be taken that the cut be made from the centre of the nipple towards the circumference of the areola, so as not to divide the lacteal ducts. Inflammation of the Breast, which, as it generally occurs in niu-sing mothers, and terminates in suppm-ation, is usually called Milk Abscess, may occur in three situations ; 1, in the Subcutaneous Areolai* Tissue, Supra- mammary Abscess ; 2, in the bed of Areolar Tissue in wliich the Mammary Gland is lodged, Submammary Abscess; and 3, in the Gland itself. Mammary Abscess. 1. Inflammation, followed by Abscess of the Subcutaneous Areolar Tissue of the Breast, though common dining lactation, occins more fre- quently than any other form of inflammation in this region at other periods of life, more pai-ticidarly about the age of puberty.^ Its symptoms are those of simple phlegmonous inflammation, differing in no way from abscess of this kind in other situations, except that it is abvays distinctly circimi- scribed. , 2. Inflammation in the Areolar Plane between the Mamma ana579 INFLAMMATION OF THE MAMMAEV GLAND. the Pectoral Muscle clittuscs itself over the whole of the areolar layer, and almost invariably runs into abscess with considerable rapidity, giving rise to <n-cat pain, of a deep, heavy, and throbbing character, much increased by moving the arm and shoulder, and attended by swelling, oedema, and a slight red blush upon the skin. The breast becomes prominent, is conical and pro- jecting, the whole organ being pushed forwards by the pressure from behind ; it is not readily movable on the pectoral muscles, the subcutaneous ’^'eins become engorged, and at last abscess forms. It is not always easy in these cases to determine whether suppuration has taken place or not, the depth at which matter forms rendering it impossible in the early stages to detect fluctu- ation until it approaches the surface ; its presence may, however, be suspected on the occuiTeuce of deep-seated throbbing pain, oedema, and some superficial redness. The abscess at last points at some part of the margin of the gland, usually at its lower and outer side, where the matter seems to gnavitate ; after a time, however, it will commonly appear at other points of the circum- ference of the gland, beyond which it always extends, seldom, if ever, per- forating the structure. A series of four or five apertures, forming a large circle round the margin of the gland may thus form. It very commonly happens that the apertines through which the pus discharges itself in these situations, degenerate into fistulous canals, by no means easily closed. 3. Inflammation of the Mammary Gland itself is not of such frequent occmTence as either of the other forms of abscess. When the whole of the organ is aflected, it gives rise to great swelling of the breast, with severe aching and lancinating pain, and much constitutional disturbance, usually of an iiTitative type. Not unfr-equently one lobule only of the gland becomes inflamed ; and then the local signs are proportionately limited, and occa- sionally cease. As Velpeau has pointed out, one lobule after another may become inflamed, so that a succession of abscesses forms in different parts of the gland. As the inflammation advances to suppiu’ation, the skin is reddened, assumes a dusky hue, becomes glazed, has a peculiar greasy appearance, and pits on pressure. VTien matter has formed, the tension of the superficial parts, with oedema and perhaps deep-seated fluctuation, determine its presence. Treatment—1\\ the treatment of inflammation and abscess of the breast occun-ing dining lactation, it must be borne in mind that we have not a sthenic inflammatory condition to deal with, but that the disease almost invari- ably happens in delicate anmmic women, commonly of a strumous habit, and weakened by recent partinition; indeed, the affection appears to be an in- flammation of an in-itative and congestive rather than of a sthenic character. It is therefore obvious that antiphlogistic means of an active nature are not admissible ; and the best plan of treatment appeal’s to consist in keeping up the strength of the patient by proper constitutional support, at the same time that the local inflammation is checked by topical antiphlogistic mea- sures. The fu’st thing to be done is to prevent if possible the occuiTcnce ol suppuration ; if this can be accomplished, Avhich is, however, rarely the case much will he gained. In order to effect this, the breast should be supported in a slmg, so as to lessen congestion of it; the arm at the same time beino- fixed to the side, in order to prevent traction of the pectorals and movement P P 258o DISEASES OF THE BREAST. of tlie submammary areolar tissue. Tf tlie patient’s strength be good, leeches may be applied ; iu the majority of cases, however, they will not be required, but warm lead lotions or the assiduous application of camomile or poppy fomentations may be substituted in their stead ; at the same time, the milk should be drawn off by means of a breast-pump or sucker, the child being put to the unaffected breast or weaned, and an occasional saline purgative admini- stered. When suppuration is impending, the application of fomentations may be continued, the patient being allowed a more liberal supply of nourishment, with a moderate supply of malt liquor ; and, so soon as matter can be felt, it should be cut domi upon and let out by an aperture in the most dependent position. It is of great importance that the matter should be let out early, and by an opening into the lowest part of the abscess ; if it be not, it burrows deeply, diffusing itself through the areolar tissue under, beyond, and around the gland, and opening at several points, leaves long fistulous tracks perforat- ing the breast in various directions. When suppuration is going on, the patient’s strength must be supported with tonics, the mineral acids, bark, and quinine. Porter must be liberally allowed, and plenty of nourishment given. The sinuses that are left may usually be induced to close by attention to the state of the general health : should they not do so, however, the employment of pressure and the use of stimulating injections may, in time, accomplish this. In the event of their proving rebellious, it has been proposed to slit them up ; but this is au unnecessarily severe practice, and may, I believe, in aU cases be dispensed with. Chronic Abscess of the Breast may assume two forms ; the Diffused, and the Circumscribed or Encysted, Chronic Biffnsed Abscess of the breast may occur at all ages, in the single or in the manled. It usually appears iu the submammaiy areolar tissue, often without any external exciting cause, but as a consequence of impaired health, in strumous or cachectic females, and is often connected with uterine derange- ment. It may acquire a very large size, aud, pushing the mammary gland before it, gives the breast a conical pointed shape. Fluctuation soon becomes apparent, and the ordinary local signs of chronic cold or congestive abscess disclose themselves. The Treatment of chronic diffused abscess ot the hreast consists in making a free outlet for the pus in a dependent situation, and keeping it free with a drainage-tube ; at the same time that the general health is improved with iron or cod-liver oil on ordinary medical principles. Chronic Encysted Abscess of the breast is a disease of great impoitance, inasmuch as it closely simulates various tumours in this situation ; so much so indeed, that it is only with extreme difficulty that the diagnosis is effected in’some cases. The breast has in numerous instances been amputated on the supposition of its being the seat of tumour, when it was merely the seat of a very chronic thick-walled abscess. It usually commences as the result of preg- nancy, whether complete parturition or miscarriage take place sometimes as a consequence ot lacteal jneammation, but usually without any injury or othei direct local cause. An indurated indolent swelling forms, and “ ■ > gradually soften in the centre j but fluctuation may for a long J "ndistineft, and eren absent, being obsetued by the tluclr wall of plasticTUMOUnS OF THE BREAST. 581 matter that is tbroAvn out aroimcl the collection of pus. It is owing to the deposition of this dense mass of limiting fibrine, that the chronic en- cysted abscess is commonly developed as a hard and apparently solid lump. It is in o-eneral not very distinctly circumscribed, and of but moderate mag- nitude ; "after a time it remains stationary, or but slowly increases with but little pain during a space of many months ; it is not unfrcquently attended with retraction of the nipple. The diagnosis of this form of abscess is of great importance, inasmuch as it has not nnfrequently been excised for imnour of the breast. I am acquainted with many instances in which this mistake has been com- mitted. Such an error may, however, commonly be avoided by attention to the following points ; 1, that the existence of an abscess is almost in- A'ariably preceded by impregnation, parturition, or miscaniage ; 2, that there is more or loss codema of the subcutaneous areolar tissue covering it; ?>, that, although it is of slow formation and without pain, it is not dis- tinctly circumscribed, but gradually fuses in an iiTCgular manner into the neighboin'ing tissues ; 4, that it is not freely movable, but rather incorporated Avith adjacent parts ; and 5, that elasticity, or even deep fluctuation, may be commonly felt at one part of it. Should there be the least doubt in the case, the introduction of an exploring trochar, by giving issue to the pus, will always determine its true nature j indeed, this simple means of diagnosis should never be neglected in any case in which there is reason even to suspect the possibility of the apparent tumour of the breast being in reality an abscess. Treatment.—In the chronic encysted abscess, as well as in the diffused form of the disease, the drainage-tube is most useful ; but, should the mass of plastic matter be very large and dense, a seton may advantageously be passed across it in a perpendicular direction, so that the plastic tumour may be softened and caused to disappear by the inflammation thus excited in it. In aU cases of chronic abscess of the breast, but more particularly in the submammary, the arm should be kept at j)erfect rest in a sling or bandaged to the side. TUMOURS OP THE BREAST. The study of the various tumom-s of the female breast, more especially in a diagnostic point of view, is of the first importance to the practical Surgeon ; for, though it might be supposed that it would be easy, if not to recognise the minuter shades of pathological difference between morbid growths so super- ficially situated as those of the mammary gland, at all events to diagnose the malignant from the non-malignant afiections of this organ, yet in practice nothing is more difficult in many cases : and it not only requires great experi- ence, but also an intimate acquaintance with the sjDecial com’se and symptoms of each particular disease, to come to a correct conclusion as to its nature. Even with all the light which experience and a careful examination of the characters of the tumour may throAv upon the nature of the disease, it Avill be impossible for the Surgeon to avoid oceasional errors in diagnosis. Mammary tumours may be either simple or malignant. The original recog- nition and classification of the different Aurieties of simple tumour that affect582 DISEASES OF THE BREAST. the breast-gland, is principally due to Sir A. Cooper ; and this important de- partment of sm-gical pathology has of late years been much extended by the researches ot Velpeau, Birkett, and Paget. It is only very recently, however, that the confusion that has hitherto surrounded this very intricate subject has been clcared up, and it is chiefly by the recognition of the characters and by the study of the natural history of the various forms of sarcoma that affect the breast, that this has been accomplished. NON-MALIGNANT TUMOURS. The non-malignant tumours of the breast comprise the Chronic Mammanj Tumour, the different varieties of sarcoma and Cijstic Grotvlh, the Painful Tahercle, Hydatid Cysts, and various forms of Fibrous, Cartilayinous, and Osseous Groivths. Chronic Mammary or Adenoid Tumour, or Adenoma, is perhaps the most common variety of these benign structures. It usually occurs as the result of blows, squeezes, or lacteal irritation, and is almost invariably met ■with in young women under thirty years of age ; usually in women otherwise healthy ; and most frequently in those of a sanguineo-nervous temperament. It is often associated ■with the hysterical temperament, and connected with, if not dependent on, uterine iratation and sexual excitement of an irregular kind- This tumour is generally of small size when first perceived, and may remain stationary for many years ; or it may slowly increase, and at last attain a considerable bulk. In other cases it may veiy rapidly grow to a great size. In a case on which I operated some years ago, the tumour had continued for eighteen years about the size of a wahiut, but in the course of six months it increased to an enormous magnitude, and on removal weighed nearly five pounds. This tumoiu’ usually commences as a small, movable, finely nodulated growth, attached by a pedicle to one side of the mammary gland ; it is hard and incompressible, often appears isolated, and is not generally painful; it in- creases slowly, without discolouring the skin or becoming attached to it, and is frequently many years in attaining a moderate size. It is often floating, as it were, in the substance of the gland, into which it can be pushed back. This tumour is frequently mistaken for a cancerous gvowth, and the diagnosis is often as difficult as it is important; though in many cases the otherwise good health of the patient, the mobility of the mass, the absence of all impUcation of the skin or glands, the Avant of hardness, and its circumscribed character, will indicate its true natiue. On examination after remoA'al, an adenoma appears to be irregularly lobu- lated, is encapsuled, and its cut surface is found to present a bluish or gieyish- white colour, Avhich, after exposure to the air, assumes a rosy tint; and, on pressure, cfrops of a thick creamy fluid are often seen to exude. Under the microscope, it has been found by Birkett to consist of imperfectly dcA elopcc hypertrophy of the glandular tissue ; the terminal cells of which are^fiUed^Avitli epithelial scales. For microscopical characters, see Figs. 290,291, p. / 04, 0 . Adenoma, though usually very chronic in its progress, may at times assume extreme rapidity of growth, so as almost to simulate malignant disease, inisTREATMENT OF CHRONIC MAMMARY TUMOUR. 583 usually happens in those cases in which an adenoma has remained in a quiescent state from an early period up to about the middle of life, or in which it devclopes for the fimt time between the ages of 35 and 40 years. In these instances it will grow with extreme rapidity, attaining in a few months a size equal to that of a cocoa-nut, or even larger, and simulating in this respect the progress of an encephaloid tumour. Such rapidly growing adenomata are pain- less° and, however large, continue perfectly movable, free fr-om deep adhe- sion’, or from glandular implication ; the skin covering them is healthy, thinned, and unadherent, the nipple projecting usuaUy very prominently. The tumour itself will be felt to be nodulated, semi-elastic, not stony, and always rounded in outline. After removal its section is lobulated and glisten- ing, something resembling a mass of rice or sago jelly, often having cysts interepersed through its substance, containing fluid or semi-solid glandular tissue. Treatment.—Yhx?, consists in attention to the general health, and in the employment of local absorbent remedies. Under this treatment, adenomata have occasionally disappeared; in some instances they have been known to become spontaneously absorbed after maiTiage or during pregnancy. If obsti- nate, their dispersion may be facilitated by the occasional application of two or three leeches, followed by inunction of iodide of lead ointment ; and by the internal administration of Plummer’s piU, and the compound decoction of aloes. In addition to these means, the employment of compression will be found especially serviceable; this may be applied either by means of Amott’s slack air-cushion, or by Tanchou’s plan, which consists of a pad to which a spiral spring is attached, and which, being compressed by a proper arrangement of bandages across the chest, will keep up steady and continued pressure upon the tumoiu’. I have employed this kind of apparatus, which is far less ex- pensive and cumbersome than the air-compressor, in several cases of adenoma, mth great benefit. The advantage attending it is, that it can be used in con- junction wth absorbent ointments, which cannot be used uflth the air-bag, as the grease entering into their composition destroys the macintosh cloth of which it is made. In this way absorption may not unfrequently be secured ; and I am disposed to think that not a few of the so-called cases of cancer of the breast that have been reported as having been cmed by pressure, were in reality instances of the adenoma in which absorption had been brought about in this way. Should the growth attain too great a magnitude to admit of absoiption by the means that have just been recommended, its excision must be practised. In doing this it is not necessary to remove the whole of the breast, but it will be quite sufficient to extiipate the tumour itself, and at most the small lobe of mammaiy gland connected with it. This may be done, if the ^owth implicate the edge of the mammary gland, by two incisions that radiate from the nipple as fr’om a centre, thus inclosing a triangular portion of the breast. If it be very movable, and in the substance of the gland itself, it may often bo enucleated through a simple incision. In removing this tumour, 'there are two little practical points that should, if possible, be attended to. 1. The gland should not be incised through its whole thickness, so as to open up the areolar bed which is interposed between it and the pectoral muscle. If this be interfered with, infiltration of blood or of pus into ifc may occur, and deep584 DISEASES OF THE BREAST. abscess may form imcler the breast or at the lower edge of the gland, leadina- to very troublesome consequences. '•>. The Avound must not be closed tightly by sutures and plasters. If this be done, the discharges are retained, and bur- rowing of unhealthy matter into the submammary areolar tissue often takes place, leading to extensive suppuration behind the mammary gland, often of a most troublesome and tedious character. I have found it better to leave the wound open, and to dress it from the bottom. When the tumour has been allowed to attain a very large size before re- moval, it Avill generally be necessary to extirpate the nipple and the Avhole of the mammary gland, which will be found either invoh'ed in the tumour, or in an atrophied but otherwise healthy state. Sarcomatous Tumours frequently develop in the mammary gland. They are difficult to distinguish fr’om adenomata, but are usually somewhat softer, more rapidly force their growth, and tend to develop at a later period of life in Avomen aboA'e rather than in those under thirty years of age. The rapidity of groAvth of these tumom-s Avheii soft is very great, and many of the cases that up to a recent period have been described as encephaloid tumours of the female breast, have in reality been these rapidly growing soft sarcomata. Their cha- racters have been so fully described at p. 7G5, Vol. I., that they need not be recapitulated here. They haA^e also been described as rapidly groAving adenomata and “ recurring fibroid ” tumours. In many cases it is impossible to distinguish them accurately fr'om cancers until after extirpation ; and it is to this difficulty of diagnosis, and the confusion that has hitherto existed be- tween sarcomata and cancer—a difficulty that can only be cleared up by the microscope — that “ cancer-cm-ers ” owe much of their success. Igmorantly confounding the simple Avith the malignant gi’owth, they claim to have cured the cancer when they have only destroyed the sarcoma. In some cases sarcoma returns after operation, even though the Avhole of the mammary gland has been extirpated with the tumour. I believe this to be the case most frequently, if not solely, when the sarcoma is of A^ery rapid groAvth. In one case, where I had removed a very large tumom’ of this kind Aveighing about four pounds, with the whole of the iiiA’olved and atrophied mammary gland, from a lady forty years of age, in 1859, reciu'rence took place in 1861, and again in 1863, 1864, 1865, and 1868. The recurrent tumom-s AA'cre developed at some little distance from the original cicatrix, and proved on careful examination to be simple, without any cystic formation 01 can- cerous deposit, or any evidence whatever of malignant action, and Avere suc- cessfully removed. The patient’s general health continued perfectly good throughout. When a sarcoma is not only exceedingly rapid in its growth, but reem-s after removal, suspicions of malignancy not unnaturally arise, as two of the most frequent and important elements of such a condition, exuberant vegetative activity and local return, exist. But the absence of all contamination of neio-hbouring structiu-es, superficial or deep, of glandular implication or of visceral deposit, and of constitutional cachexy, will indicate the benign cha- racter of the disease. In such cases as these, the tendency to recurrence wil in mo"st cases gradually wear itself out; and, after several operations have been required at intervals of months, or a year- or tAvo, the disease Avill cease to beCYSTIC TUMOUR. 585 reproduced, and a cure will be thus established. But instaiiees are not wanting in which the tendency to the local reproduction of the sarcoma has been so active that it out-ran all possibility of complete cxtii;pation, and eventually destroyed the patient. For reference to a case of this kind, see p. / 08, \ oi. . Painfal Mammary Tumour.—It occasionally happens that the chiomc mammary tumour becomes the seat of very severe and paroxysmal neuralgic pains, attended with very considerable cutaneous sensibility, constituting the form of disease that goes by the name of the painful mammary tumour, i his condition most fi-cciucntly occurs in early life, and in women of an irritable and delicate constitution ; it is commonly associated with disorder of the uterine functions, the pain increasing at the catamenial periods,^ and appearing to be essentially owing to the implication of some of the twigs of the intercosto- humeral nerves in the disease. The Treatment of this affection must have special reference to the removal ot the neuralgic condition. This is commonly best effected by the internal ad- ministration of alteratives and tonics, more particularly of the preparations of iron and zinc, with cod-liver oil if necessary ; and by the inunction of the iodide of lead ointment, conjoined with belladonna or aconite, into the affected breast. In many cases the application of a few leeches from time to time, csiiecially in the vicinity of the axilla, wiU lessen the neiu'algia more effectually than any other jilan of treatment; and in others, again, pressure wdll be found sernceable. If all other means fail, excision of the tumoiu’ may in this, as in ■ the last case, ultimately be found necessary. Cystic Tuxiour of the Breast is one of the most common of the non- malignant affeetions of this organ. It may occiu' in three distinct forms: 1. As a Single Unilocular Cyst ; 2. As several of these cysts ocemving together, a Compound Cyst; and 3. As the Cysto-Sarcomatous Tumom’, in which the cystic development appears to be superadded to a structure analogous to that of the chronic mammary tumour. Besides these forms of non-mahgnant cystic tumour, we occasionally meet with Cystic Cancer of the breast. 1. The Single or Unilocular Cyst of the female breast, described by Sir B. Brodie as the Sero-Cijstic Tumour, and by Sir A. Cooper as a variety of hydatid tumoiu, usually occurs at first in the form of a small thin sac of about the size of a filbert, containing a clear serous fiuid, imbedded in the glandular substance of the breast, and movable under the skm. Sometimes more than one cyst of this kind is present in the breast; though, as one attains a gxeater development than the others, the smaller one may readily escape detection. These cysts when single and small always contain a clear serous fluid, but as they increase in size, or become multiple, their contents may assume a gi’eenish-brown or blackish tiuge from admixtiue vdth a small quantity of effused blood. They may continue for a great length of time of small size ; but in other cases they gradually increase until they contain several ounces of fluid. They then become very tense, with the skin drawn tightly over them, through which they shine if superficial. Sir B. Brodie is of opinion that they are originally formed by a dilatation of the lactiferous tubes, and refers to a preparation in which this position can be demonstrated. This may be the case in some instances, but in most cases they are undoubtedly, as often happens with cystic growths in other organs, of independent formation.DISEASES OF THE BREAST. 586 The Diagnosis of the aficetion may usually be readily effected by feeling the globular elastic cyst under the skin ; the mammary gland being movable, and not adherent to any of the adjacent structures. In those cases, however, in which the tumour lies deeply, the diagnosis may not so readily be made, more especially from some of the cystic forms of cancer to which I shall afterwards have occasion to advert. In fact, nothing is more easy than to diagnose the true nature of a superficially seated cystic tumour,—nothing more difficult in some cases than to diagnose one deeply seated at the under surface of the mammary gland. For, the whole thickness of the gland intervening between the cyst and the finger, the sense of elasticity is lost, and a solid feel com- municated, which may readily mislead even an experienced Surgeon, When- ever the Surgeon has any doubt about the existence of fluid in a tumour of the breast, he should introduce an exploring tfochar ; when, if the disease be cystic, the fluid will be discharged. If the tumour prove to be solid, no ill consequences will result from the simple puncture. Several instances have ocemTed to me in which, from the want of this simple precaution, very ex- cellent Surgeons had condemned, as cancerous, tumours of the breast which jDroved to be cystic. Unilocular cysts of the breast occasionally attain an immense size, at the same time that their walls remain thin and supple. In some of these instances, the fluid continues to the last of a truly serous character ; in other cases, how- ever, it becomes more or less glairy or mucilaginous, and hence Velpeau has described this variety as the Sero-onucous Cyst. In other cases, the walls of the cysts have been known to undergo calcareous degeneration. When these cysts attain a very large size, their walls being thin, and the skin covering them tense, they may become translucent, and thus constitute trae hydrocele of the breast, resembling in many respects similar serous tumours that form in the neck. 2. Compound Cysts.—In the majority of instances, as has already been observed, no material alteration takes place in the cyst, except, perhaps, its gra- dual increase in size ; but in other instances, peculiar changes occiu’ in it, in conse- quence of which it becomes filled up by a dense solid growth springing from the interior, at last undergoing ulceration, and giving rise to a series of destructive changes (Figs. 662, 663). The pathological phenomena that accompany these changes have been ably investigated by Sir B. Brodie. He finds that, in the fii’st instance, one or more membranous cysts, containing serum, are formed in the breast ; the fluid gradually becomes darker in colour, and opaque ; after a time a fibrinous excrescence, of a lobulated or foliated form, springs up into the interior of the cyst, gradually displacing and occasioning absoi-ption of the contained fluid, and at last fiUing up the whole of its interior; and then coming into contact with the capside by which it is compressed, or with which it may be firmly incorporated, the whole tumour is converted into a solid mass, m which the remains of the cysts still continue to be perceptilile. Sir B. Brodie thinks that there is reason for believing that a growth of a fibrinous substance takes place from the outer side of the cyst as well, thus adding to the general size of the breast. If one of the larger cysts be laid open, or if the pressiue ot the intracystic growth cause inflammation and ulceration of its capsule, t may at last be perforated, and a fungous mass will sprout tlu-ough it, prcseutii „I li ■i COMPOUND CYSTS. 587 many of the ordinary symptoms of a malignant f^’owth ; coloured, bleeding readily, and increasing rapidly in size. being iiTegular, dark- A^^ien sucli changes I J as these have taken place, the tumour assumes a formidable character, and will rapidly proye fatal by the induction of exhaustion and hectic.

Cystic Sarcoma.—The various forms of cystic tumour that have just been described, AA'hen associated Avith the development of fibrinous intracystic matter, constitute forms of the so-called cysUc sarcoma. Another A-ariety of this disease, however, is not unfrcquently met AAuth, in Avhich the sarcomatous or solid element of the tumour preponderates OA’er the cystic part of the gi'OAvth. In these cases the tumour AviU be found to be composed of a dense Avhite lobulated or foliated structure, closely resembling that of the chronic mam- mary tumour, and consisting either of imperfect hypertrophy of the breast- gland, or of the deposit of a fibrinous material. This mass is studded thi’oughout with a number of small cysts, varying in size from a pin’s head to a hazel-nut, and usually containing clear fluid. If some of these cysts increase out of proportion to the rest, the tumour Avill assume more of the true cystic character. This form of cystic sarcoma usually occius in Avomen from thirty to thirty- fiAm years of age, as the result of injury or as the remote consequence of some inflammatory action during lactation. On examining a breast affected in this way, it AAdll be found that the tumom’, which may either be confined to one lobe or may implicate the whole of the gland, is hard, heavy, and solid to the , feel ; on careful examination, hoAvever, its surface may be felt to be finely ■ nodulated; and, occasionally, a larger cyst than usual may be found projecting, Avhich is recognised by its elastic feel and globular shape. The disease is sIoav in its growth, and does not implicate the adjacent cutaneous or areolar structures; hence, the tiunoiu’ is movable on the pectoral muscles, and the skin is unattached to it. The axillary glands, also, are not enlarged, at least not to any material extent. The nipple AviU usually be foimd to be normal in its shape, and not depressed. The eventual development of malignant action in these cystic tumours by the deposit of cancer in the interior of the large cysts must not be overlooked. A tumour of this kind may be benign for many years, and remain generally so throughout the greater portion of its structure ; yet, after removal, en- cephaloid may be found to have formed in some of the cysts. In the case from which the drawings (Figs. 664, 665) were taken, the tumour had ■existed for more than twenty years before removal, haAdng commenced at the age of tAventy-eight; but, after extirpation, cancerous matter was foimd at the bottom of some of the cysts, which, as the constitution Avas uncontami- nated, Avas doubtless of recent formation ; and the siuface of the fungus was •epitheliomatous. Treatment.—The treatment of these various forms of cystic and sarcomatous groAvths varies, according to the number and size of the cysts, and the quantity ■of solid matter deposited inside and around them. When the cyst is small and i ^single, the fluid contents may be let out by punctiuing Aidth a small troebar; but a cure cannot usually be effected in this Avay, as the fluid readily reaccumu- lates. In cases of this kind. Sir B. Brodie found considerable advantage ■from the application of stimulating embrocations, more particularly of one composed of equal parts of camphorated spirit and AA^eak spirit, with one-eij, t589 q'jlj<j^[TMENT OF CYSTIC SARCOMA. f T^lumbi Tn other eases, blistering and the application of the ttalt of ioclL may I.e sci-viccablo.

Occasionally it will suppurate spontaneously, and is thus got rid of; or it may be opened, a tent of lint intro- duced, and thus suppuration established in it. Operative Treatment.—If the tumour be unilocular and single, containing* serous flitid, possibly with fibrinous matter.in its interior, it may often be dissected out of the areolar bed in which it lies, and be separated from its attachment to the mammary gland, this structure and the nipple being other- wise left intact. In this way I have successfully removed large unilocular cysts of the size of a shaddock. If the cyst be compound and numerous, the case is more serious, and then their extirpation only is not advisable. '^^^len the disease is truly a Cgstk Sarcoma, it is better either to leave the tumour and treat it by palliatives, or to remove the whole breast; partial removal of the breast, extirpation of the tumour with its lobe of the mammary gland only, is not usually a very successful operation. Eecurrence of cystic development will almost certainly occur ; and often very severe inflammation of the gland and of the ad.iacent textimes is set up. This I have seen on several occasions, and therefore think it better that the breast should either be left, or removed in ioto. Such an operation, however, should not be under- taken in the early stages ; as the tumour may continue for many years without seriously troubling or endangering the patient, and may perhaps eventually undergo atrophy or absorption. If, however, it show a disposition to increase, to become troublesome by its bulk, or painful, it should then certainly be extir- pated ; and this operation may always be performed with a good iwospect of success, inasmuch as the disease is not malignant, and docs not tend to contami- nate the constitution. It is a remarkable fact, however, which has been adverted to by Lawrence and Brodie, that, even though the whole of the breast be extir- pated, a similar affection occasionally recurs in the cicatrix, requiring subsequent operation ; and then, perhaps, being pennanently eradicted. This^’miist eitherDISEASES OF THE BREAST. 590 bo owing to some portion of the cystic structure having been left in the first | operation, or to the development of now cysts in the site of the former ; but to < which cause it is referable, is still uncertain. The repeated recurrence of these v, cystic tumours is very remarkable. Cassar Hawkins relates a case in which the growths had to be removed eight times for as many roeuiTonces. After the j removal of the cystic sarcoma, a recurrent tumour of cancerous character is sometimes developed in the cicatrix, even in cases in which there is good reason to belicA'C that there has been no carcinomatous element in the primary disease. Yet in other instances it is doubtless owing to the cancerous degene- ration of the cystic growth, which may originally have been benign, but in which a malignant action has established itself before removal. Sangximeous Cysts are occasionally met Avith in the mamma. They present the ordinary characters of cystic development, but are sometimes accompanied by bleeding from the nipples, and, when tapped, ai’e found to contain dark thin grumous fluid. Vamous hare TmiouRS.—Besides these tumom-s, the breast is occasionally the seat of other morbid growths ; for instance, flbrous, osseous, and cartila- ginous masses have been met with. AU these affections, however, are of extremely rare occurrence ; and, when they form, it is almost impossible to determine their true nature until after removal. Their extirpation is usually jn-actised on account of the obscurity attending the diagnosis, and the fact of their commonly being mistaken for cancerous growths. The most important of these, perhaps, is a Recurrent Fibrous tumour, Avhich shows a remarkable tendency to retin-n after removal. This it may do many—as often as eight or ten—times. Sir A. Cooper describes a Scrofulous Tumour of the breast; the precise natiu’e of which is not very apparent from the account given by that great i Sui-o-eon. It is not improbable, hoAvever, that it is of tuberciflous character ; | and Velpeau states that he has found tubercle occurring in the breast in j two forms : in the first, primarily deposited in the skin and subcutaneous I cellular tissue ; and in the other, as a fibro-tuberculous affection of the gland itself. . Hydatids of the breast are of rare occurrence, and have been principally described by Sir A. Cooper ; cases have also been related by Griife and others. These hydatid tumoiu-s are so excessively rare and obscime, that their true natui-e would not, in all probability be suspected until after removal. They present the ordinary characters of deeply seated cysts, Avith fluctuation and some induration round the globular swelling, and an absence of pain. In such a case, an incision into the tiimoim AAdll cause the escape of the acephtdocysts, and the ultimate suppuration of the cavity in which they lodged, which aaiII gradually cicatrise. , i j. -ii In some rare cases, tumoiu'S containing Foetal Remains haA^e been met AAutli in the breast: these, however, are rather matters of pathological curiosity than , of practical importance. CANCEB OP THE BREAST. All the various forms of cancer haA^e been met with in the breast; sciiibns, however, occurs Avith far greater frequency than any of the other varieties.SCIRRIIUS OF THE BREAST. 59^ OccasioiiaUy the eiicephaloid form of the disease is met with, but colloid is very rare Cancer of tlie breast, whatever form it assume, is invariably Tirimary :'it may afiect one lobe only, or be infiltrated into the whole gland ; and it may commence in the nipple or in the skin covering the breast. Most frequently one breast only is affected ; but in some cases both mammary glands ai’e implicated. ... Sciuiuius.—Scirrhus is the form of cancer which is commonly met with in I the breast. It may occur in several ways : either affecting the nipple, impli- \ eating the skin, being primarily deposited in the form of an intramammary tumour ; or iiifiltratiiig the whole substance of the organ. It most commonly : commences as a circumscribed tumour of small size, at first perhaps smooth : and round, hard and indolent in its character, with little or no pain ; it is readily movable, may be situated in one lobe, and is attached perhaps to the ! rest of the gland by a distinct pedicle. As it increases in size, it becomes hard, knobbed, and in-egular, perhaps presenting a finely gi’anular feel, and ' becoming fixed to the gland and subjacent parts. When the disease begins as I scirrhous infiltration of the breast, the mass is from the first hard, rugged, iiTe- : gular, nodulated, and heavy; often someivhat square in shape, and early accom- jianied by adhesions to subjacent parts. In other cases, the development of the scirrhous mass is accompanied by a corresponding atrophy of the mammary gland, which becomes shrivelled and disappears entfrely. In some instances, rather large cysts may form in connection with the sciiThous mass. In a woman, whose breast I once removed for what was supposed to be cystic sarcoma, but which proved after the operation to be a scirrhous tumour, the mass contained several cysts as large as cherries, filled with dark or greenish fluid, and projecting from its surface ; and in a lady under my care for scirrhus of the breast, a tumour as large as a pigeon’s egg, containing sanguinolent fluid, formed on the surface of the tumour. As the swelling increases in size, it has a tendency to be more fixed to the subjacent parts, becoming adherent to the pectoral muscles and incorporated ■with the areolar tissue at the border of the axilla. The tumour also besrins O to form a distinct external projection, and becomes- more irregular in shape ; it is the seat of severe pain, more particularly at night; and is usually covered by a plexus of blue and dilated veins. The ordinary symptoms of cancerous cachexy now appear, and the disease then makes stiU more rapid progress. The tumour may in some cases remain for a great length of time without implicating the Skin; but most commonly, after it has existed for a few months, this tissue becomes more or less involved in the morbid action. In- stead of being loose and movable over the surfiice of the cancer, it ^\i\\ be found, on being pinched up between the fingers, to dimple at one jDai’t, where it may be felt to be attached by a kind of cord-like process to the tumour bcnca.th it. After a time, that portion of the skin which first became fixed m this way acquires a reddish or purplish colour, and is covered with thin scaly epidermic desquamations, and becomes permeated by a number of small ramifying vessels. A crack or fissure eventually forms in this ; a small exuda- tion of a mucous fluid takes place, which dries into a scab ; under this, ulcerative action sets in, which speedily assumes the ordinary chax’acters of aDISEASES OF THE BREAST. 592 scirrlious ulcer, luiviug hard, elevated, and everted edges, a greyish-green or foul surface, and discharging a quantity of very fetid pus. In some cases ulceration may take place at several points, and thus the whole surfaee of the breast become converted into one immense chasm, Avhich may even extend up into the axilla. The skin, when affected, often assumes a red, glazed, hard, and brawny character, being shining, and as if gTeasy upon the surface, having its pores enlarged, and enveloping the side of the chest in a kind of stiff solid casing, attended usually by much pain, considerable cedema of the arm, and an aggravated form of constitutional cachexy : ulceration at last takes place in this hardened mass, and then speedily destroys the patient. In other cases, the cancerous development seems to develop primarily, and to expend its energy chiefly upon the cutaneous structures. The tumour of the gland is small, atrophic, and. implicates the nipple. The cancerous infiltration rapidly spreads into the surrounding integument, which becomes early contaminated, assuming a hard, leathery character, or feeling brawny and infiltrated ; often without discoloration, but presenting a hypertrophied appearance, the pores being enlarged, and the interspaces between them increased. In other cases, the infil- trated skin assumes a brownish or purplish colour, and is covered by rough desquamating crusts, so as to resemble the bark of an old tree. This diseased state of the integuments will extend very widely, without ulceration or fm’ther development of the tumour situated in the gland. I have in this way seen the integuments of the whole front of the chest, from the clavicles to below the mamnite, and from one axilla to the other, infiltrated, hard, and leathery, of a brownish-red colour, forming a stiff cuirass, as it were, but Avithout ulceration. This condition is very chronic ; and it is remarkable that in it the axillary glands are not infiltrated, or the constitution rendered cachectic, at nearly so early a period as when the disease primarily originates in the mammary gland, and secondarily involves the skin. Another way in which the skin becomes involved primarily, is by the formation of a scirrhous tubercle or nodule in it, usually towards the outer or axillary border of the mamma. From this the disease gradually infiltrates inwards, impheating the gland in a secondary manner, and usually but to a limited extent. The Pain is in many cases but trifling in the early stages of the affection ; so much so, indeed, that it is the tumour, often accidentally noticed, that first excites alarm ; as it increases, however, the suffering becomes severe, more particularly at night, is greatly aggravated by handling the diseased mass, and chiefly extends up to the shoulder and doAvn the arm. The pain usually becomes most severe about the time when the skin is first implicated ; but, as the cutaneous infiltration goes on, it gradually lessens, OAvmg probably to the destruction of the cutaneous nerves. Retraction of tlie Nipple commonly commences about the same time that the skin is implicated ; it appears to be owing to the glandular substance becomino- involved in the mass of the tumour, and thus giving rise to shorten- ing of the lacteal ducts ; in consequence of which, by the projection forwm-c s of the general mass of the breast, the nipple appears to become completely burled.'^ This sign has received more importance than it deserves in coiinec-STRUCTURE OF SCIRRHUS OF MAMMA. 593 tioii with cancer, as it does not occur in all cases of malignant disease, and is occasionally met with in simple mammaiy tumours. . , The Axillary Glands usually become enlarged early in the disease, and may attain a gi'eater size than that of the original tumour; and on close examination a kind of indurated cord may be felt extending in the course of the absorbents, from the edge of the pectoral muscle to the axilla. After a time, the supraclavicular or subclavicular glands may likewise become impli- cated. In fact, the whole of the glandular structures in the vicinity of the shoulder undergo cancerous infiltration. When this is the case, the pressure upon the axillai'y vein may occasion oedema of the arm and hand. The glan- dular infiltration usually increases rapidly after the skin has become implicated. In some cases, scirrhus of the axillary glands is the primary disease : and in other instances, when the glands become affected, the chief virulence of the disease appears to expend itself upon them ; the tumour of the breast ceasing to enlarge, or even wasting, whilst the secondary glandular deposits in the axilla become greatly developed. As the scirrhus extends, it may gradually affect the subjacent muscles, cellu- lar tissue, the ribs, and at last the pleura, giving rise eventually to hydrothorax or secondary visceral deposits. In many instances, however, the disease proves fatal by the induction of exhaustion. The constitutional cachexy is m many cases not very distinctly marked, until after the skin has become involved ; but then it rapidly increases, more especially when ulceration takes place. Indeed, the cancerous degeneration of the skin may be looked upon as an epoch of peculiar importance in scirrhus of the breast, as it is at this period that the pain increases, that the lymphatic system becomes infected, and that the constitution becomes distinctly poisoned. Duration.—The duration of life after the occurrence of scirrhus of the breast varies greatly; so much so, that the disease may be considered as assuming an acute and a chronic form. The acute variety principally occurs in ruddy and plethoric women, and commonly proves fatal in a few months. In those who are of a more feeble and delicate constitution, the disease, as a general rule, takes a slower course. Sir A. Cooper states that the disease, on an average, is from two to three years in growing, and from six months to two years in destroying life after being fully formed. In this estimate, which is probably correct, Walshe agrees ; so that the average dimation of life in cancer of the breast would probably be about three years. As a general nde, the progi-ess of scirrhus is slower in old people, in whom it occasionally ghes lise to a kind of atrophy of the breast, with shrinking and induration of the tumour. There are many instances on record, however, in which cancer of the breast has existed for a far longer period than has just been men- tioned ; for ten, twelve, or even, as in a case related by Sir B. Brodie, for twenty-five years. Pathological Structure.—After removal, scirrhus of the mamma presents considerable variety in appearance. In the majority of instances it occurs as a peculiarly hard, knobbed, and irregular mass, croaking under the knife when cut, and presenting on section a greyish or bluish-grey, semi-transparent surtacc, tra^'erscd in various directions by bands of a more opaque character and exuding on pressure a thin reddish juice. In many instances, masses of Q Q594 DISEASES OF THE BREAST. an opaque appearance and yellowish tint may be seen in the midst of the tnmonr. These, which look like tnbercnlons deposits, consist in reality of fatty degeneration of the scirrhous structure. In other cases again, on pressino- the tnmonr, small drops of a thick creamy fluid will appear to exude at various points. This seems to be the inspissated and altered secretion of the gland retained in the ducts. Cysts arc occasionally, though rarely, met with in scirrhns of the breast; these are usually small, and contain clear fluid, beino- deeply imbedded in the substance of the tumour ; in other cases they may be large and globular, and filled with a bloody or dark-green liquid.. The microscopical characters of scirrhus of the breast are such as are represented in Fig. 305 and 306, Vol. I. Encephaloid.—Encephaloid of the mammary region and gland is by no means of such common occurrence as scirrhus, yet all the varieties of this form of cancer have been met with in the breast; and fungous hasmatodcs has been seen to spring from the bottom of cystoid gTowths previously developed in this region. Encephaloid of the breast may sometimes acquire a considerable size ; thus, Cruveilhier relates a case in which the tumour weighed nearly twelve pounds. The structure of this disease does not differ from that of the same affection in other situations ; both the hard and the soft varieties may be met with, and in some advanced cases the true fungus htematodes occurs. But undoubtedly many forms of rapidly growing and fungating tumour of the mamma, which up to a recent period were considered, described, and figured as encephaloid, are in reality not cancerous at all, but simply forms of soft sarcoma, with a tendency to rapid growth, fungous sprouting, and interstitial hemorrhage. Encephaloid usually begins deeply in the substance of the breast, though sometimes, but more rarely, at a little distance from the gland, as a soft globular tumour, which rapidly increases in bulk ; the integuments covenng it are not at first adherent, but are usually pushed before it, and speedily become permeated by a largely ramified network of veins. In some cases I have seen the integuments, early in the disease, cedematous and inflamed, so as to mask the subjacent tumour. The mass at first feels as if composed of seA'eral soft and rounded tumours, which communicate an obscurely fluctuating sensation, perhaps causing the Surgeon to mistake the growth for a cystic formation or an abscess ; with Avhich it is especially apt to be confounded in those cases (rare, it is true) in which the skin is inflamed and cedematous. The breast now rapidly assumes a very prominent and conical form ; the skin covering it at its most projecting part becomes thinned and reddened, and at last gives w^ay, leaving a large circular ulcer, from which a fungous mass of gi-eyish or reddish-brown colour speedily sprouts up, with a good deal of discharge of a foul, bloody, and offensive character. From this, disintegrated masses are occasionally detached by a kind of sloughing action; and cases may even occur in which the whole of the fungous protrusion sloughs away, and ' cicatrisation taking place, a tolerably perfect cure may result. These in- stances, however, arc so rare as scarcely to influence our prognosis of the necessarily fatal character of the affection. Implication of the glandular structures in the vicinity of the tumour, followed by constitutional cachexy, occurs in this as in true scirrhus of the breast. The progress of- the disease595 CAUSES OF CANCER OF THE BREAST. is always extremely rapid, particularly in yoimg and otherwise healthy subjects. Colloid of the brc?,st is of rare occurrence, and, when met with, is usually associated with scirrhus or encephaloid. It may, however, occur singly ; and, slo\vly gro\\-ing, may attain a very large size. I have removed from the breast ■of a lady a colloid tumour which, after growing for five years, had attained a Aveio'ht of six pounds. Its colloid character was established after careful exa^ mination by G. Harley. In this case the tumom- was smooth, somewhat lobed, but not adherent to the skin or subjacent parts. On section after remoAval, it was found to be of a yellowish-brown colour of varying shades, and composed of a dense, smooth stroma, with numerous loculi and sacs filled with glaiiy, transparent colloid matter. Causes of Cancer of the Breast.—These are usually extremely obscure. Sex is certainly the circumstance that has the most marked influence on the occuiTence of mammary cancer, the disease being, as is iveU known, almost ■entirely confined to women ; yet instances in which this affection is met with in the male breast occasionally occm-. Its peculiar frequency in the female may possibly be owing to the gveat and sudden alternations of the functional -acti^•ity of the breast in women. The changes impressed upon this organ at puberty and diu’ing pregnancy, the various alternations which it undergoes, the inflammatoiy affections to which it is subject diu’ing lactation, the frequent iiritation to which it is exposed by sympathising with uterine derangement, and the diminution in its vital activity that takes place at the change of life, ure sufficient to explain the great liability of this organ to disease generally; nnd may not improbably give a clue to the reason why it is peculiarly the seat •of cancer in women. Age.—The age at which cancer of the breast most frequently occurs is between the thirtieth and fiftieth years. According to Birkett, it is most com- monly met ivith between the ages of forty-five and fifty—a period of life that is popularly looked upon as specially obnoxious to this malady. At these ages, cancer of the breast usually affects the form of scirrhus. When it ocem's, •as it very rarely does, in early life, it more fr-equeutly assumes the encephaloid •character. I have, however, removed a scirrhous breast fr’om an unmarried woman twenty-three years of age. In elderly women also, scirrhus is the prevalent form ; though I have seen several instances of encephaloid at an iidvanced period of life, one case in a woman upwards of seventy years of age. Indeed, cancer in either form may affect this organ up to the latest period to which life is prolonged. j\Iarried women are said to be more liable than single ones to cancer of the breast; it may, however, fairly be doubted whether they are proportionately so ; and it is a common belief; founded, I think, in some degree on truth, that the disease is most common in women who have not borne children. Injaiies inflicted'upon the breast, such as blows, squeezes, &c., are coni- Srcatly dreaded by women, as the causes of cancer. la they might be so in constitutions otherwise predisposed to the affection < ocs no appear impioljable ; and that they are so in reality in many cases I l.avo,.ot tl,c least <lo„bt. The number of instanees that ^mvo foliL Set- Q Q 2DISEASES OF THE DEEAST. 596 luy observcation, in which u blow or squeeze of the breast has speedily l)ceir followed by the appearance of a cancerous tumour in it, leaves no doubt Avhatever on my mind of the truth of the popular belief that assoeiates the injury with the disease, in the relation of cause and effect. Lacteal wjiam- mations are likewise frequently supposed to tend to the production of cancer of the breast. Of this doctrine, I think that we do not possess at present sufficient proof; though it appears highly probable that disturbance of the- functions of the organ during lactation may predispose to the occuiTence of this disease. Diagnosis.—The diagnosis of cancer of the breast from other diseases- affecting this organ is of the first importance, and is attended by coiTcsponding difficulties. The great point is to determine whether the tumour of the breast be of a cancerous character or not; that the Surgeon should go beyond this, matters little in practice—and, indeed, except in some of the forais of cystic disease of this organ, few practitioners would feel disposed to endeavour to carry their diagnosis beyond this point. The great and essential difficulty in determining the nature of a tumour of the breast consists in the fact of the same signs being more or less common to many gi’owths in this region; a hard, circumscribed, indolent mass, chronic in its progress, with a certain amount of pain, being the usual characteristics presented by all sohd mammary tumoiu'S ; and though in nine cases out of ten a tumour presenting these- characters, which has existed for a year or more in an elderly woman, and has- resisted ordinary absorbent and alterative treatment, is scirrhous, yet instances; of the reverse occasionally occur. Nothing can better exemplify the difficulty of diagnosis in tumours of the breast, than the circumstance, wffiich is not un- frequently witnessed, that after the removal of the diseased mass, its section, and careful examination. Surgeons of equal experience will differ as to whether it be malignant or not, and to what class of affections it should be refeiTed ; and, indeed, in many of these cases it is impossible to ascertain its precise- nature -without having recourse to microscoiucal observation. It is exti’emely difficult to lay down any definite rules of diagnosis by which the question as to the malignancy of a tumour of the breast can be solved. In the majority of cases of rustic [iroivih in this region, there is little difficulty the existence of cysts of sufficient size to be readily felt or seen through thc- skin being generally chai’acteristic of the non-malignant cystic growths. It must be borne in mind, however, that cases, such as one to which allusion has already been made, may occui’, in which cysts are conjoined with cancerous- development. The diagnosis between cystic sarcoma and some forms of rustic cancer of the breast is not always easy ; indeed, it may be impracticable, and only be? determinable after remov al by microscopic examination. I have had in the Hospital a patient fifty-nine years of age, in whose breast a hard tumour, as large as half an orange, had existed for five years ; it was perfectly and Ireely movable, unconnected in any Avay w'ith the skin ; there was no retraction of the nipple, and no lancinating pain. On its upper side, several large cysts could be felt, and seen through the skin. On examination after removal, it was found to be encysted scinffins, with large cysts of the size of cherries, con- taining bloody and yellow fluid. The only very suspicious circumstances here597 diagnosis of cancer. verc the age of the patient, and the existence of one small indurated gland m ‘''l,rthtsc CMS of doubt, tuo safer plan is always to make an exploratory puncture and, if necessary, to examine under the microscope the contents Withdrawn by the groove in the needle or by the trochar ; indeed, if theie be the slightest Liibt as to the nature of the tumour, this should nci-cr be omitted before its removal is determined upon. 1 liaN C more than once seen tumours ivhich had been positively pronounced to be scirrhous, and for ivhich amputation of the breast had been recommended, prove to be Hjystic, and disappear entirely ivhen their contents were i^nthckawn. Between cancer and the onlinary solid tumours of the breast, more especially the sarcomata, the diagnosis is often extremely difficult; but we may arrange the chief signs of the two forms of disease in distinct groups, when, by c-omparing them together, the differences may be more clearly seen. {See Table.)

Recurrence after removal, though a very suspicious circumstance, is l)y na598 DISEASES OF THE BREAST. means a proof of malignimcy. Eapiclly growing sarcomata will recur. This I liave seen happen five times in a lady, otherwise in perfect health, and without a trace of malignant disease in the system or in the tumour (sec page 584)., So also the recurring fibroid tumour has been removed eight or ten times from the breast, before its complete extirpation has been eft'ected. TuEAT:\rENT.—In cases of cancer of the breast, the first question that presents, itself to the Surgeon is, whether any plan of treatment short of the remo'^-al of the tumour holds out a prospect of cure, or even of relief; and if not, whethei- the extirpation of the cancerous breast can be undertaken with a prospect of ridding the patient of an othenvise fatal disease, or at least of prolonging her existence. To these questions the remarks made at pp. 790 et seq., Vol. I., on the general treatment of cancer, may be considered applicable. The manage- ment of cancer of the breast, however, involves so many special considerations- of importance, that it becomes necessary to consider its bearings somewhat in detail. No constitutional means appear to be of the slightest service in arresting,, and still less in removing, cancerous tumours of the breast. The ad-s’autages. stated to have been derived from the use of arsenic, conium, iron, various, preparations of meremy, &c., have not been borne out by experience ; and,, indeed, it may be stated generally that these and all other known remedies are^ perfectly valueless in the emutive treatment of this disease. Compression by various means, whether by plasters, as employed by Young ; by agaric, as used by Recamier ; by the spring-pads of Tanchou ; or by the slack air-cushion of Arnott, has been much praised, not only as a. palliative, but as a ciuative means of treatment in this disease ; and cases are- recorded, which, however, even the warmest advocates of this plan of treat- ment are forced to admit to be altogether exceptional, in which the employ- ment of this means has been stated to have'effected a complete removal of the- tumoiu’. But, although I am not prepared to deny that hard and chronic tumoiu's of the breast may have become absorbed during the employment of tins treatment (and indeed I have had occasion to observe this in my own practice, in cases of chronic mammary growth), I think that evidence is- altogether wanting to show that an undoubted case of cancer of the breast has. ever been ciued by this means. And, notwithstanding the high authority with which some of these alleged cures of cancer have been brought before the pro- fession, no positive proof has been adduced to show that the tumour that was. observed was really and truly of a cancerous character, and that it may not- have been either a chronic mammary tumoiu’, o]’ an encysted abscess of the- breast. Every practical Sin’geon well knows that it is utterly impossible, im the present state of science, to diagnose in many cases with complete certainty the true natine of a tiunour of the breast, and must frequently have witnessed, cases in which, after extirpation, the morbid growth has been found to be of a. different character from Avhat had originally been supposed. I am^ acquainted • with at least eight or ten cases in which some of the most experienced Sui^ geons, both in this country and in Paris, have amputated the breast for supposed iin-hus ; when, after removal, it was found simply to haA-e been the seat of a chronic abscess with very dense walls. And vdth regard to a hard, chrome, and indolent tumour of the breast, few Surgeons will hazard a positive diagnosis as599 OPERATION FOR CANCER. to whether it is scirrhous or not, until they have actually seen a section of it; and even then it often happens that men of ecpial experience mil differ in the judgment they pronounce as to its nature. For these reasons, it is impossible not to receive with the utmost hesitation the cases of supposed cancer of the breast reported as cured by the advocates of compression, and not to suspect that the cases recorded by these gentlemen as instances of the successful employment of this plan of treatment may have been other chronic tumours of the breast, than those of a cancerous character. But, though there is no evidence before the profession to prove the utility of compression as a curative agent in cancer of the breast, I think^ that, when practised with Arnott’s slack air-cushion, or Tanchou’s spring-pad, it is of con- siderable value as Vk imlUalive in some of the earlier stages of this disease; when it may undoubtedly occasionally arrest its progress for a time, diminish the size of the swelling, and lessen the violence of those attacks of lancinating pain which are so distressing to the patient. In conjunction with the pressure, much relief to suffering may be afforded by the use of belladonna plasters, or of atropine or aconite inunctions, together with the internal exhibition of conium, and morphia or hypodermic injections of morphia and atropine. In the advanced stages of the disease, however, when the skin is involved, the pressure is often unbearable, increasing the pain, and acting as a source of irritation to the patient. In some cases of this kind, in which the slack air- cushion could not be borne, I have seen relief afforded by moderate pressure with thick layers of amadou, supported by an elastic bandage, belladonna or conium in powder being dusted on the innermost layer of amadou. A very thin gutta-percha shield, moulded to the part, may sometimes be advan- tageously applied over this, and kept on by turns of an elastic roller. 'Wken the skin is implicated and very tender, the application of belladonna and lead lotion is of use. When the disease has run into an idcerated stage, the inter- nal administration of conium, so as to blunt the sensibility, and the local application of chlorinated lotions to lessen the fetor, together with the appli- cation of the watery extract of opium or of belladonna, wdU relieve. In cases of this kind, the application of caustics has been greatly vaunted, and portions of the diseased surface may be cleansed or removed by these means. The employment of the various antiseptic dressings that are familiar to aU Surgeons is of much service in the advanced stages of ulcerated cancer of the breast, removing fetor, and lessening the inflammatory irritation occasioned by the decomposition of the cancer matter. Caustics, applied in accordance with the principles laid down at ,p. 801, Vol. I., may occasionally be advantageously employed in the treatment of cancer of the breast, when excision is not practicable : as when the patient is alarmed at and positively refuses to submit to the knife ; w'hen she is anmmic or aged, so that the effects of loss of blood arc to be di’caded ; or when the cancer is already ulcerated. Operation.—The constitutional and ordinary local treatment of cancer of the breast being thus, at the most, of a palliative character, the question of operation always presents itself at last. The objects proposed are, in the first place, by the extirpation of the diseased breast, to prevent constitutional infec- tion, and thus permanently to free the patient from her necessarily fatal6oo aflectiou DISEASES OF THE BREAST. . . 111 t^iis, to retard tlie progi-ess of the constitutional inlection, and thus at least to prolong existence. How far these objects are attained by amputation of the cancerous breast is a subject of important incjuiry to the Surgeon. The operation has been discountenanced Ijy many excellent patliologists ; not so much Irom any intrinsic danger it may possess, foi, although occasionally fatal from erysipelas or some similar accidental complication, there is nothing specially hazardous about it; nor from its being now, as formerly, open to the objection of subjecting the patient to unnecessary pain, all suffering dm’ing its performance being prevented by anesthetics, and little inconvenience being experienced at subsequent dress- ings, Avhich are usually nearly painless ; but the great objection lies in the fear of the disease, in many cases, returning and running its course as rapidly after the operation as if none had been performed, and in others perhaps even more rapidly. The principal points in connection with the operation appear to resolve themseh-es into two questions 1. In any case of cancer of the breast, may constitutional infection be prevented by amputation of that organ ; and, if so, under what circumstances wiU this most probably happen ? 2. Although the disease may eventually return in the part or elsewhei’e, may not excision arrest the rapidity of the fatal termination ? {Yuh p. 80C et seq., Vol. I.) 1. To the first question, it is not easy to give a very definite reply. Nothing shows more clearly the ntter worthlessness of many so-called surgical statistics, than the discrepancy that exists between those which have been published as exhibiting the liability to relapse of cancer after operation. Thus, HiU states that out of 88 cancers on which he had operated, at least two years before the retimi was made, there were only ten relapses, and 2 deaths ; whilst Alexander Monro states that, ont of CO cancers which he had seen removed, in only 4 patients was there no relapse at the end of the second yean Boyer saved one only in 2y, and Macfaiiane gives a still more unfavourable accjount of his practice ; for he says that, out of 32 cases of cancer operated upon by himself, there was not one instance of radical cure ; and of 80 other cases 'with which he was acquainted, the result was in every instance unfavourable. Warren, on the other hand, saved 1 in 3 ; and Cooper 1 in 4. Amidst such conflicting statements as these, it is clearly impossible to eliminate more than the general fact, which is well known to every Surgeon ; that, in a large number of the cases of cancer operated upon, there is a tolerably speedy retm-n of the disease. In these cases there are, however, many j)oints to be taken into aceount, of which gross statistics can take no cognisance ; much being necessarily depend- ent upon the skill with which the operation is performed, as well as upon the care employed by the Surgeon to ent widely of the disease, and to extirjmte completely not only the whole of the morbid mass, but those tissues in its neighboiu’hood which appear to be impheated in however slight a degree. In many of these cases, also, it is by no means improbable that the practice, at one time rather generally followed, may have been adopted, of merely ex- tirpating the tumoiu’ without removing the whole of the breast. I am there- fore disposed to look upon any deductions based upon the statistics of Hill, Macfarlane, and Benedict, as of very little if of any value when applied to the surgery of the present day. This is more especially the case Ifom the fiict.OPERATION FOR CANCER OF THE 6or already adverted to, that it is oidj comparatively recently that it has been pos- sible to distinguish, ei-en after removal, certain forms of sarcoma from cancer and that all statistical statements in reference to the question of recnrrence of cancer of the breast after operation, made anterior to this period, must be utterly valueless, inasmuch as hard sarcomata were generally mistaken for scirrhus, and the soft and rapidly growing ones were confounded with encephaloid. The only inference fairly deduciblc from those inquiries is that in a certain proportion of cases, whatever the precise ratio be (and this is still undetermined), « disease supposed to be cancer has been effectually removed by extirpation of the breast. 2. As to the second question,—whether as a general rule life may not be prolonged by the performance of the operation,—it would appear, if the statistics collected by Leroy D’Etiolles be accimate, that hitherto it has not been so. Walshe comes to the conclusion that the operation cannot, as a general rule, be regarded as a means of prolonging life, but that in the majority of cases, death is hastened by such interference. Sir A. Cooper and Sir B. Brodie both agree that, in most cases, the disease returns in two or three years after the operation, and then kills the patient. But, though the general result of a statistical inquiry into this subject, based iipon the imperfect materials and probably very incoiTect figm’es at present before the profession, leads to the conclusion that operation for cancer of the •breast, when indiscriminately performed, has hitherto not only failed to cure the disease, but has actually in a great number of cases hastened its fatal termination, yet it must be admitted that instances have occurred in which life has been prolonged by this means considerably beyond its average dura- tion in this disease. Thus, Callaway operated on a case in which no return took place for twenty-two years. Velpeau states that he removed encephaloid tumours of the breast, and that the patient remained free fr’om the disease for eight or . ten years. Sir B. Brodie and other Surgeons relate similar in- stances in which the patient’s life has been prolonged for many years •after the operation ; and the experience of the most eminent practical Biu’geons is decidedly in favoiu of having recoiu’se to it imder certain cir- cumstances. But, high as is the authority that must necessarily attach itself to the statements of such great Surgeons as Velpeau and Brodie, it is impossible not to suspect that some of the tumours may not have been cancers, but only sarcomata, which the means of diagnosis possessed by these eminent men were insufficient to distinguish from true cancers in all cases. Ihe most trustworthy statistics that we possess on the relative dui’ation of life in cases of cancer of the breast, with or without operation, are those col- lected by Sir James Paget, Morrant Baker, and Sibley. Paget states that, of 11J cases, 6G were not submitted to operation ; of these the average diu’ation of life was a little more than 48 months. Of 47 operated on, the corresponding average was also a little more tlian 49 months. In the first two years of the disease the proportion of deaths was much less in those operated on than in those who were left—being in the former 24 percent., in the latter 3G percent. I he longest duration of life in cases not operated on was 18 years ; in those operated on, a little more than 12 years. Alorraut Baker finds that in 84 casesi)ISJ!:ases of tjie breast. 6o2 in which no operation was performed, the average duration of life was 45 months ; in (\2 cases operated on, the average was u(ii months. Sibley finds that the average duration of life in miopcratcd cases was about 32 months ; whilst in those subjected to amputation of the breast it reached b4 months. Thus it will be seen that, independently of the possible chances of a complete cure, the operation holds out the prospect of an average gain of nearly two years of life. There is, hoAvcver, another point of view' from which these operations may be considered ; for, even if they do not prolong life, they may greatly improve the patient’s condition, and place her in a state of comparative comfort during the remainder of her existence. Thus, she may be suffering so much pain from the local aflection, or, if the cancer be ulcerated, may be so much annoyed by the fetor of the discharges, that she may be placed in a position of far greater comfort by having the local source of disease and irritation removed ; and though she die eventually of cancer, it may be with much less suffering tO’ herself and others for her to be carried off by cachexy with secondary de- posits in the lungs or liver, than to be w'ora out by the pain, discharge, and haemorrhages, of a slowdy progressi-^'e ulcerating cancerous mamma. The question as to the advisabihty of operation in any given case of cancer of the breast cannot, however, be determined by abstract pathological reason- ing, by reference to scientific principles, or by calculations founded on sta- tistical results. The Surgeon must minutely examine and attentively w'eigh all the circumstances of the particular case before him, and he must endeavour to distinguish those cases in Avhich the operation may possibly be the means of preserving or prolonging life, from those in w'hich there is no prospect of its being of any service, or in which indeed it must inevitably hasten the patient’s death. 'Whatever the value of statistics may be in determining the question, whether in cases of cancer of the breast generally the operation will effect a cure or prolong life, they ai’e not equally valuable in their apphea- tion to individual cases. When a Surgeon is called on for his opinion respecting the propriety of amputating the breast of the patient before him, it is not sufficient for him to be able to state w'hat the general result ot the operation may be, but he must be able to satisfy himself whether the pai- ticular instance under consideration may or may not be one of those cases, exceptional perhaps, in which there is a possibihty of extirpating the disease entirely from the system, or at all e'S'ents of prolonging the patient s existence. In order to do this, it is necessary to endeavour to lay down some rules that may guide us in selecting those cases in Avhich the operation may be advan- tageously done, and in setting aside others in wdiich w^e know' that it will almost to a certainty hasten the patient’s death. And, indeed, it is the alisence of all such considerations in general statistical investigations into the results of operation for cancer, that deprives them of much of their value as guides m actual practice. , • t • • f Though nothing can be more unsurgical or improper than the mdiscrimma extirpation of cancerous tiimom-s of the breast from all patients who may pm- sent themselves in whatever stage of the disease ; and though such ^ would doubtless be follow'ed by fully as disastrous results as those that oc- curred to Macfarlane, Benedict, and others ; yet there can be little douSELECTION OF GASES FOR OPERATION. 603-, a Surgeon who would employ u certain principle of select on, very dillerent and a tar more successful result in Ins practice. Sii B. Biod has^veiT clearly and succinctly pointed out the most important circumstances, by which the question as to the propriety of operating 111 these be determined. Before doing so, ho very justly dwells on the fact that 1 many cases the operation may tail, and the disease speedily recur, thioug the neo-lio-cncc of the Surgeon in leaving portions of the gland, slices of the- tumour or contaminated tissues, and that thus the operation may receive dis- credit for what is in reality the built of the Surgeon who has performed it. ■\\'ith reference to operation, cancerous diseases of the breast may be dmded into three classes :-l. Those in which it is the duty of the Surgeon to dis- countenance excision ; 2. Those in which operation is of doubtful expediency and ;-5. Those in which it is the duty of the Surgeon to recommend it. _ 1. Cases unfit for Operation.—This class includes cases presenting the: following conditions; a. Strongly marked constitutional cachexy ; 1. Disease in both breasts ; c. Secondary deposits in internal organs ; d. Much enlarge- ment of the glands under, and especially of those above, the cla'^icle ; e. Ad- hesion of the tumour to the ribs and intercostal muscles ; /. Hard, bra\vny,. and infiltrated skin, of a reddish-brown colour, having a hard, leatheiy feel,, or a greasy, glazed appearance ; g. Eapid growth of the tumoiu’ in a patient- w'ith a strong hereditary taint; //■. An extensiA'ely ulcerated and fiuigatiug- tumour. 2. Doubtful Cases.—«. If the patient be aged, weak, or anmmic, and the- tumour large, it is seldom expedient to operate, as the shock may destroy life. 1. ATien the skin is merely dimpled in by a kind of pedicle passing; from the tumour to its under surface, an operation may be performed, unless- other circumstances should contraindicate it; but in such cases it is necessary widely to excise the integument surrounding the attached point. The cancer- cells, as I have more than once had occasion to observe, will have diffused themselves extensively through the neighbouring skin, ryhich, to the naked eye and to the touch, has a perfectly healthy appearance, the tumour being- smTounded by a kind of halo or atmosphere of cancer-infiltration, c. "When there is but moderate enlargement of the axillary glands, which are so situated as to admit of removal, the operation may be performed, d. When the cancer- is ulcerated, it is seldom proper to operate ; but, if all other conditions be favourable, this even need not in some special cases be a bar. As Sir B. Brodie has pointed out, the patient’s existence may sometimes in these cases be pro- longed, and her comfort materially increased, by removing the diseased and idcerated mass. Old age exercises a material influence on the expediency of operating for cancer of the breast. As a rule, I do not think it advisable to do so after- seventy years of age, unless the distress from pain or the discomfiture fi’om fetid ulceration be so great as to render removal at any risk justifiable. The danger of the operation is greatly increased by advanced age, more especially if the patient is stout; and if recovery take place the expectancy of life after- seventy -would not be materially, if at all, increased by the extirpation of a disease which would probably recur in a fatal form Avithin two years ; the more so, as the progress of cancer at adA-anced age is often very slow.1604 DISEASES OF THE BREAST. 3. Cases favourable for Operation.—The exclusion of all the cases that fall under tlie preceding- categories will necessarily limit very materially those in which an operation may be undcrtakeji; it can, hoAvever, be per- formed with every prospect of its being advantageous to the patient, if the tumour be of moderate size, slow or nearly stationary in its growth, uncon- nected with or at least merely attached by a pedicle of the skin, pretty dis- tinctly circumscribed, movable on the subjacent parts, and not complicated hy enlarged glands in the axilla or elsewhere. Tire patient has an especially good prospect of recovery, according to Brodie, if the disease be seated in the aiiijplc. AMien once a tumoiu’ of the breast has been ascertained to be of cancerous ■character, the sooner it is removed the better, unless one of the special reasons adverse to operation that have just been adverted to should exist. I cannot conceive that any good can come of delay in these cases. The disease (for reasons stated at pp. 791—8JO, Yol. I.) appears in the early stages often to be entirely •local : there is no evidence of constitutional infection, but if the operation be delayed the skin speedily becomes implicated, the axillary glands enlarge, and cancerous cachexy sets in. As a general rule, it may be stated that in all cases cf cancer of the breast the Avhole of that organ ought to be freely removed, ■especial care being taken that no slices- of manmiary structure be left behind ; •and after removal the under surface and edges of the gland ought to be careMly examined, with the -^’iew of seeing that the extirpation has been complete. When the cancer is infiltrated, the vdiole of the breast and the surrounding cellulo-adipose structures must be very freely removed, as there is often a halo of cancer-deposit ai-ound the morbid mass, in tissues apparently healthy. It may happen that the tumour, especially if scirrhous, is apparently isolated, and situated at one border of the gland, scarcely, if at all, connected -with that structure. Here the question will arise, as to whether the whole of the organ ought to be removed or not. In determining this we must, I think, be guided by the position of the scirrhous mass and the size of the breast. The cancer-infiltration proceeds in the course of the lymphatic vessels. If the cancer be situated towards the sternal or under aspect, however isolated it may appear, it mil be found that the mammary gland will certainly have become infiltrated, lying as it does between the morbid mass and the lym- phatics. YTien, however, the tumour is seated at the upper or outer border cf the gland; when it appears to be detached from the breast, lying rather in the axiUa or below the clavicle than in connection with the gland ; when tlie breast itself is very large and fat, but healthy to the feel, mthout hardness or retraction of the nipple ; Avhen there is no sign whatever of deep infiltration of the breast—it may then be a question whether it will not be more prudent to extirpate the tumour alone, with the adipose bed in which it lies, and a deep slice of the adjoining mammary gland, than to perform the more serious opera- tion of remoHng the whole of the breast. In determining this point we must, ' I think, be guided by the situation of the tumour, the feel of the breast, and the size of that organ. If the tumom- be distinctly axillary, if the breast tee perfectly soft and healthy, with the nipple projecting, there is no reason to tear infiltration by cancer of the central and sternal portions of the mammary g am . I have found on careful microscopical examination of breasts removed torAMPUTATION OF xiu^ scirr were •1ms afc the axillary border, that the above-named parts of the glancc entirely free ft-om all sign of disease. If the mamma be small and shrnnken, the whole may be removed without any increase of danger ; if it be- vervlaro-c the Burgeon best consults the patient’s safety by simply removing the tumour with a deep triangular slice of the contiguous portion of the gland > Imt if there be any hardness or suspicious nodulated feel about the mammary «dand if the line of demarcation between it and the tumour bo not defined,, and particularly if the patient be thin, so that the operation is not a very severe one, the extirpation of the whole of the breast ought certainly to be- practised.' However widely the parts are removed, the line of incision usually comes together readily and ei’enly, owing to the laxity of the integuments in the mammary region. I have observed in those cases in which it becomes necessary to extirpate tumoiu's of the mammary region, without removal of the gland, that eiysipelas has more frequently followed the operation than when the gland, being affected,, has required removal. Return of Cancer after Operation may take place in three situations ^ in the cicatrix of the part operated upon ; in the' neighboming lymphatic glands ; or in some internal organ. When cancer recurs in the neighbourhood of the previously affected part, it is probably owing to the cancer-cells having diffused themselves so widely into the skin, the subcutaneous areolar tissue and muscles, or neighbouring lymphatic glands, and after the removal of the tumoiu- these cells become the germs of new growths. In these circumstances it may recur in the cicatrix and then implicate the glands ; or in the glands, without the cicatrix having been pre\'iously affected. In local relapse of this kind, it often happens, that the disease, so reproduced, runs its course more rapidly than if no operation had been performed ; the increased action set up. in the part during the healing process appearing to give augmented force to- the reproductive energy of the cancerous growth. In some cases it even rctuins in the wound before cicatrisation is completed, the ulcerated surface- then assuming the ordinary character of the cancerous ulcer. In other cases, the cicatrix, some weeks or months after it is fully formed, assumes a dusky red or puiplish tinge, becoming hard, stony and nodulated at points ; these nodules being round or oval, often very numerous, and varying in size from a pin’s, head to a pigeon’s egg, studding the whole length and breadth of the cicatrix, and at last running into true cancerous ulceration. In such circumstances, the only hope of prolonging the patient’s life lies in the speedy excision of the- whole of the diseased stractures, or their extirpation by caustics, i^rovided there bo no deep affection of the glands, nor evidence of internal secondary deposit. But if the axillary glands be much enlarged, either alone or together, with recurrent disease in the cicatrix, or if there be any sign of internal cancer, further operation will be imin’oper. Amputation of the Breast.—The question of amputation of the breast should always be raised and discussed with more than ordinary regard to the. feelings of the patient. A woman looks upon her breast as alike the emblem and the ornament of her womanhood. She shrinks from the idea of its being affected by disease. She suffers acutely in mind when it is invaded by tumour of any kind : the horrid dread of that disease being cancer ever haunts herDISEASES OF THE BREAST. <6o6 thoiiglits, not so mucli from the fear of the possibly impending operation, but rather from the distress of mind, in many eases amounting to a sense of humiliation, at the idea of the mutilation of whieh she is about to beeome the A-ictim. The operation for the remoyal of a breast, whether affected with •cancer or with other disease, may be performed in the following Avay. d’he patient should lie upon a table, with the arm hanging over the side, tied down ■or held by an assistant. If the tumour be large, and the loss of blood a mattci of much consccj^uence, another assistant should compress the subclavian artery on the first rib. The haemorrhage ^vill, however, depend more on the natui'e than on the size of the tumour. In all cancerous tumours, but espe- •cially in the encephaloid, it is considerable, and from many enlarged vessels. In simple tumours, even of very large size, it is often trivial. I have remoA-ed ■a simple tiunour of the breast of many pounds weight, and only had to tic •one spouting vessel. Indeed, nothing indicates more conclusively the enor- mous vegetative activity of cancerous tumours, and the great drain they must •exercise upon the system generally, than the large size and gi-eat number of their supplying arteries, compared with those sent to a simple tumour many times larger than the malignant one. If the veins about the part be much •dilated, measures should be taken to aiTCst the flow of blood from them, as it may sometimes be dangerously profuse; indeed. South relates the case of a patient who died from this cause during the operation. In amputations of the breast for malignant disease, there are thi-ee principal and vital points that must be attended to : 1. Always to remove the whole of the breast-gland ; 2. Always to remove the nipple ; 3. Always to remove widely all dimpled skin. The direction of the incision through the integuments is varied by difierent Surgeons ; some prefer a transverse, others a perpendicular one. I think that no definite plan should be followed, but the direction of the cut made to vary according to the situation and size of the tumour, and the amount of integu- ment that requires removal. In all cases, the nipple should be included. In ■ordinary cases, as a general rule, I prefer an oblique incision following the course of the fibres of the great pectoral muscle ; as it enables the Surgeon, if necessary, to extend the cut into the axilla for the removal of enlarged glands, and, after cicatrisation, alloAvs the movements of the arm -without undue traction. An oblique elliptical incision, of sufiicient length, may thus be made, fii’st below, and next above the nipple, so as to include a sufficient quantity of integument (Fig. (!(){)). In some cases, where the skin is somewhat involved, a transverse incision may be made in addition to this, so as to include the affected integu- ment in a triangular manner. When the tumour is very large and prominent, a double vertical incision may very conveniently include the nipple and the most suspicious parts of the skin. The dissection should then be rapidly canicd down, by a few strokes of the scalpel, to the pectoral muscle, and the Ijreast removed from the cellular bed in -which it lies. When the tumour is of large i size, and especially if it be of simple character, this part of the operation may be done very expeditiously by drawing doum the mass and touching the areolar tissue with the scalpel, when the whole tumour will peel off the pectoral muscle, and can readily be detached. Alter the removal of the diseased breast, it and the tumour, as well as the whole interior of the wound, must be carefully6o7 amputation of the breast. examined, in order to ascertain that no slices of morbid tissue have been left behind • if so, they must be freely cut out; and if, as sometimes happens, the -roivth be rather firmly adherent to the pectoralmuscle or subjacent stxuc- turo« portions of these must also be removed. Should it be found that there m-e any enlarged glands in the axilla, they may be extii-pated either by extend- ino- the ivound upivards in this region, or by making a separate incision into the axilla, and carefully dissecting them out. In doing this, the edges and point of the scalpel should be very carefully used, and the glands rather teased iut by the handle of the knife and the fingers, so as to avoid the risk of hiemoiThage, which is apt to be troublesome in this situation, ihe extirpation ■of cnlai'gcd axillary glands is the most difficult part of operations on the Fig. GGO.—Incisions for Eeiuoviil of Cancer of Breast. breast, as they often extend much higher into the axilla and under the edge of the pectoral muscle than -would at first appear. When exposed, they may be ■seized with a double-hook or an artery-forceps, Avell di’awn down, and then enucleated as far as practicable with the fingers, aided by a few cautious touches with the edge of the knife. The less the point is used deep in the axilla, the better for the patient. Should the glandular mass extend high np, coming into close relation with the axillary vessels, it would be prudent not to attempt its complete extirpation -with the knife ; but, hawing been separated as far as practicable in the way already mentioned, it should be well drawn down, and then tightly tied as high as possible with a piece of whipcord, all that portion below the noose being then cut off. In this way we may avoid the two gi’cat dangers which attend extirpation of tumours in this locality, deeply situated and out of sight—^limmon’hage, and6o8 DISEASES OF THE BREAST. the entry of air into dilated veins; and, the ligature being applied beyond the diseased mass, that which remains of it Avill slough away when the thread separates. ' Tumours are occasionally met with in the axilla as a primary disease, un- connected with any malignant or other morbid action either in the upper extremity or in the breast. Such masses may be either lymphadenomata or cancers ; and may require extirpation. When the former, they are readily enough enucleated ; but when cancerous, they become so widely and deej^ly adherent, that their removal cannot be undertaken without much danger. In such dissections, I have had occasion to expose the axillary and subseapular vessels to some extent. The after-dressing of the wound is of great consequence. A wound that gapes immensely whilst the arm hangs down, will be found to close with the- greatest ease when the arm is raised and laid across the chest. All bleeding- vessels, then, having been secured, the edges of the wound must be brought into apposition by attention to position of the arm. Should there be a tendency to gape, or should any transverse cut have been required, the edges may be- brought together by a few points of suture. But if the integuments have not been freely removed, if the parts come well together, it is far better to dispense- entirely with sutures, and to retain the edges in contact with long narroAr strips of plaster. The edges of the wound are supported and compressed slightly by pads of lint. The womid itself is covered by a piece of antiseptic lint and the arm supported in a sling. No bandage of any kind is necessary r indeed, I look upon body-bandages in these cases as injurious. They preA'ent free respiration by their tightness, and favour htemorrhage by them AA'armth. The wound must be dressed on ordinary surgical principles. In many cases it Avill unite by the first intention ; for owing to the yielding nature of the parts- in this situation, the lips of the cut come into very good apposition, even though a considerable mass has been removed. By some it has been supposed that relapse of cancer is less liable to take place if the Avound unite by granu- lation, than if it come together by more speedy union ; of this, hoAvever, there is at present no proof with which I am acquainted, though it is by no means improbable that the suppurative action may ehminate cancer-cells from the neighboiu-ing tissues. The mortality from amputation, of the Ireast is not considerable, barely amounting to 10 per cent. The circumstances that chiefly influence it are the nature of the tumoim, the size of the breast, and the extent of the incision into the axilla. The operation is much more dangerous Avhen perfoinied for the removal of cancerous than of simple tumours : and the danger increases in proportion to the length of time the cancer has been alloAved to exist before the operation is undertaken. In proportion as the patient’s general health has become undermined by the continuance of the malignant disease, so the ten- dency to pyaemia and erysipelas increases. Women AA'ho haA'e small mammp, , Avith little fat, bear the operation best. The danger of the operation is, for obvious reasons, much greater in women with large breasts, in Avhom the areolar tissue is loaded with coarse yeUow fat. In these, reparative action is slow, and there is much tendency to sloughing and to erysipelas. Lastly, the opera- tion becomes dangerous in proportion as the tumour is adherent to the609 A A'ILLO-MAMMAR Y CA NCER. pectomi muscle, and the dissection requires to be earned doeply into tte axilla or raider the pectoral. The danger here is threctold ; I, ftom hiemoi- rlia<re • 2 from the entry of air into a yein ; 8, and chiefly, from opening lip "the deep foscia of the axilla, and the risk of the occiiiTence of deep cellulitis. When death follows these operations, it is usually the result of erysipelas or of pyaemia. There are two dangers which attend excision of the breast rather more fre- quently than other operations ; viz., 1st, a congestive or low form of pneamonia, not dependent on any blood-poisoning, but arising from defective aeration occasioned by the breathing being shallow and restrained either by tight banda^^ingof the chest, or by the pain induced by the movement of the chest- walls hi respiration ; and 2nd, embolism of the pulmonary artery. I have known several instances of death from each of these causes. The first danger can obi iously be guarded against; the second cannot. The Male Breast, though very rarely the seat of disease, may occasionally become affected in a somewhat similar manner to the mammary gland in the female ; being, in some instances, hyperiro^Jhied, in others the seat of an ahiormal secretion of millc, in other cases, affected by the formation of n/stir, sarcomatous, and scirrhous tumours. These gi’owths require removal by the same kind of operative procedure that is adopted when they affect the female breast, though of a less extensive character. Axillo-mammary Cancer presents some peculiarities that deserve special consideration. It developes at the outer and upper angle of the mammary gland towards its free border, so that, instead of growing into its substance and remaining imbedded in it, it tends to push into the direction of least resist- ance to its out-growth, and thus to extend into the areolar space at the lower border of the axiUary edge of the pectoralis major, and lie between it and the latissimus dorsi muscle. The tumour feels hard, nodulated, and is rounded in shape. Sometimes it appears to be scarcely attached to the mammary gland. But on closer manipulation it will be found to extend deeply into its sub- stance, which towards the base of the tumom’ feels hard and thickened. The greater portion of the gland, the median half and much of the lower part, •will continue long unaffected by cancerous infiltration. The nipple is not retracted until a very late period in this form of the disease. It and the areola continue to preserve their normal appearances, long after the skin above them has become involved and the axillary glands enlarged. The mamier in which the skin is implicated and the appearance it presents is peculiar and characteristic. It becomes involved early by dimpling from below in a trans- verse direction at the upper and outer border of the mamma, Avhere there is a tendouey naturally to a fold ov crease in the integument. There the skin liccomes infiltrated in a transverse line of hard scirrhus, red, depressed and puckered in, with much feeling of constriction and difficulty in raising the arm from the side. The disease, when once it has reached this stage, will of course make rapid progress both locally and constitutionally. That these axillo-mammary cancers commence in the breast-gland there can be no doubt, although their rapid development beyond its limits may, at first, lead to the suspicion that they have commenced outside it. It is only towards the upper and outer border of the mamma that those VOI,. II K RDISEASES OF THE BREAST. 6io oiitgroAving cancers seem to develop tbemselves. T have never seen them at the inner or lower part of tlie gland, unless the whole of its structure had been previously infiltrated. The operation in these cases should be complete and I tliorough, the whole organ being removed, however healthy the nipple, areola, and some portions of its gland-structure may appear to be. The skin should also be widely removed where implicated, and the dissection carried as high into the axilla as safety will permit. Unless thorough extirpation be practised, speedy and rapid recuiTcnce will ensue. In this as in all operations for diffused cancer, the wound should be well Avashed out with a solution of chloride of zinc (1 to 20), so as to destroy scattered and Avandering cells. AXILLARY TUMOURS. Scirrhous Tumours may form in men as well as in Avomen, as primary disease, under the pectoral muscle or in the axilla (Fig. 007). Such tumours might, in their early stages, be dissected out; but if they extend high up to the clavicle, or implicate the skin widely by infiltration, they should, I think;, be left, as was necessary in the patient fromAvhom Fig. G(iK was taken, Avhere the size of the tumour and its connections precluded the possibility of operation. Their re- moval cannot, indeed, at any stage, be undertaken without much danger. In dissections requisite for the ex- tirpation of such masses, as in Fig. GG7, I have had to expose the ax- illary and subscapular vessels and their accompanying nerves. The cancerous growth being usually somewhat widely disseminated, it is difficult to be certain that the Avhole is fairly extirpated : hence, recur- rence is likely speedily to take place.

By Hernia, in its widest sense, is meant the displacement of an organ from the cavity in which it is natiu’ally contained, by being protruded through an abnormal or accidental opening in its walls; when, however, it escapes through one of the natmal outlets of the part, it is not considered hernial. Thus, the protrusion of the brain through an apertime in the craniunr, or of the lung- tlu’ough one in the thoracic walls, or of a portion of intestine through the abdominal parietes, is termed a hernia of the organ ; but the descent of the bowel through the anus does not come under this designation. Here, however,, we have only to consider the hernial protrusions that occur ft’om the abdomert —the common situation of this disease. A hernia may occur at almost any part of the abdominal wall ; though it is- far more liable to do so in some situations than in others, being commonly met with at those points where the muscular and tendinous structures are weakened to allow the passage of the spermatic cord in the male, and of the round ligament in the female ; or for the transmission of the large Vessels to th& lower extremity; hence the inguinal and crural canals are the common situations of this disease. It may, however, occur in various other situations,, as at the umbilicus, the thyroid foramen, the sciatic notch, in the vagina, the pennteum, through the muscular portions of the abdominal wall, the dia- phragm, &c. Strl'CTURE of a Herxia.—In whatever situation it occurs, a hernia is composed of a Sac and its Contents. The Sac is the prolongation of that portion of the peritoneum which over- lies and corresponds to the aperture through which the hernia protrudes. It is in all cases composed of a nech and a lod]]. The Heck is usually nari’owed, though in some old hernias it becomes wide and expanded ; it is commonly short, consisting indeed of a sudden con- striction of the sac in this situation, as happens in many forms of femoral hernia ; but in other cases it is elongated, narrowed, and thickened, and even vascular in structime. The neck of the hernial sac usually becomes greatly thickened and of an opaque colour, by the deposit of plastic matter in or upon , it from the inntation to which it has been subjected by the pressure of the hernial tumour or the truss, by the incorporation of the subserous areolar • tissue lying externally to it, or by the puckering together of its folds, which have been compressed by the aperture in which it lies. The Body of the sac is usually glol)ular or j^yriform, sometimes elongatedCONTENTS OF HERNIAL SAC. 613 and cylindrical ; it may vary from the size of a cherry to a tumour as large iis the head. When recent, it is usually thin and transparent, though in sorne eases it becomes greatly thickened, having arborescent vessels ramifying m it, nnd being almost laminated in structure ; this is especially^ the case in old femoral herniie. In other instances, lioweA'er, it becomes thinned and atro- phied as the tumour expands, so that the contents become visible through it. This is especially the case in old umbilical hernim, in which I have •.seen it as thin as the finest gold-beater’s skin. In some cases the hernial sac undergoes degeneration, becoming converted into a fibrous or even cal- careous layer. The sac, though usually forming a perfect inclosure to the hernial contents, •occasionally constitutes but a partial investment to them, more particularly in such organs as the cmciim or bladder, which arc naturally partially uncovered by peritoneum. In other instances it may be ruptured, or altogether absent. The sac is absent when the hernia occurs as the result of a wound, injury, or ^abscess of the abnormal wall. It cannot be said to exist in a congenital hernia, und may be absent in ctecal and in umbilical hcrniEe. More rarely a double hernial sac is met with, one being protruded into or placed behind the other. There ai’e instances of three sacs occurring together; and Sir A. Cooper relates case in which six were met with in the same person. The abdominal parietes outside the sac undergo important changes. The ;aperture through which the hernia protrudes usually becomes circular ; after a time, indurated and rounded at the edge, and considerably enlarged ; when situated in the movable portions of the abdominal wall, as in the inguinal region, it becomes displaced in old hernim, being dragged doAvn by the weight of the protrusion, usually towards the mesial line. The subserous areolar tissue always becomes greatly thickened, often indui-ated and fatty, so as to constitute one of the densest investments of the sac, and, in some old cases of hernia, closely to resemble omentum. The more superficial structures, such as the integument and fascia, are much elongated and stretched ; often tense, but not uufi-equently hanging in folds ; they are usually thinned, but, if a truss have been long worn, they become thickened and condensed by the pressure of •the pad. Contents.—The contents of the sac vary greatly ; every ^dscus except the pancreas having been found in hernial tumours. Most frequently a portion of the Small Intestine, more particularly of the ileum, is protruded, constituting the form of hernia called Enterocele. The quantity of intestine within the sac may vary from a small section of the calibre of the gut, the whole diameter not being included, to a coil several feet in length, with its attached mesentery. After a portion of the intestine has once descended, the protruded part tends to increase in quantity ; until, as in some large and old hernim, the greater l^ortion has been known to lie in the sac. The Large Intestine is rarely lound in a hernia, though the emeum is occasionally met with. When in- testine has been long protruded, it usually becomes thickened in its coats, and nail owed, greyish on the surface, and more or less deranged in its fimc- tions. I he coixesponding mesentery becomes thickened, hypertrophied, and vascular. Omentum is often found in hernial sacs, together with intestine ; but is not6i4 HERNIA. imfrcqnently mot with alone, constituting; Epix>locele. After havinj^ l^eeii protruded for some time it hccomcs tliiekcncd, brawny, and laminated, losing its ordinary cellulo-adipose texture, and becoming indurated. Its veins usually assume a somewhat varicose condition ; and the mass of omentmn becomes, triang-ular, the apex beino- upwards at the abdominal aperture, and the base- below, broad and expanded. In some cases it can be unfolded ; in others, it is matted together into a cylindrical mass. Occasionally apertures form in it,, through which a coil of intestine may protrude, thus becoming secondarily strangulated within the sac. In other instances, cysts are met with in it. containing fluid, or into which the intestine may even slip. AYhen intestine and omentum together are found in a hernia, the disease is termed an Entero- epiplocele ; and in these circumstances the omentum usually descends before and occasionally envelopes the intestine. Besides these, the ordinary con- tents of hernise, the stomach, liver, spleen, sigmoid flexm’e of the colon,, bladder, uterus, and ovaries, have aU been found in them. In a case described by Scanzoni, the gravid uterus and ovaries were enclosed in the sac of an inguinal hernia. Adhesions commonly form within the sac in old-standing cases. These may take place between the contained viscera merely, as between two coils of intes- tine, or between these and the omentum ; or they may form between the wall of the sac and its contents, either by broad bands, or else by bridging across, from one side to the other, and inclosing a portion of the viscera. In recent cases these adhesions are soft, and may readily be broken down ; but when of longer duration, they are often very dense, and are especially firm about the- neck of the sac. Besides the viscera, the hernial sac always contains a certain quantity oifluui secreted by and lubricating its interior. In most cases, this is in but small quantity ; but in some instances, when the sac is inflamed, or the hernia, strangulated, a very considerable bulk of liquid has been met with ; I have- seen as much as a pint escape from a large hernia in an old man. inienj abundant, it is generally of a brownish colom, though clear and transparent; it is met with in largest quanti- ties in inguinal hernia. Hydrocele of the Hernial Sac.—In some in- stances the fluid becomes collected in a kind of cyst Avithin the sac, formed by the omentum contracting- adhesions to its upper part, and leaving space below for the fluid to collect, in Avhich this acciunulates- between the omentmn above and the wall of the sac below; this condition, represented in the amiexed drawing (Fig. G71), has been called IIydi ocele oj the Hernial Sac, and constitutes a somewhat rare form of disease. The fluid is often in considerable quantity; in a case which I tapped some years ago, nearly thiec- pints of dark-brown liquid had thus accumulated, and were di-aAvn off. i • wi - If we limit the term hydrocele of the hernial sac to those cases m which there is a slow and gradual accumulation ot fluid at the bottom of an o c emu ri-A.

Cui;^ing, m his woik 011 the 7VS//6-, states that, during his connection with the London Hospital, he S.1U- milv one case • and the only others with Avhich I am acquainted, besides one that occurred in my own practice, are two related by Pott, two by Pelletan one by Boyer, and one by Lawrence. This disease must not be confounded with the accumulation of fluid, in whatever quantity, in strangulated henna, or in hernial sacs that communicate with the peritoneal cavity. Its dis- tinmiishiiig feature is the accumulation of fluid in a sac that has been cut off fi-om all communication with the cavity of the peritoneum. An Accumulation of Ascitic Fluid in a Hernial Sac may occur when hernia is complicated with dropsy of the peritoneum. In one case of this kind which occurred in my practice at University College Hospital, the hernia, which was femoral, in a woman, was very tightly strangulated, as large as a shaddock, very tense, ivith distinct fluctuation ; the skin covering it being much stretched, this was pecidiarly evident. On opening the sac, fluid followed in a jet, as if a hydrocele had been punctured, and about four inches of strangled gut were found lying at the bottom of the sac. After dividing the stricture, serous fluid in large quantity continued to drain from the peritoneal cavity for several hoins after the operation. Loose Foreign Bodies have occasionally been met with inside hernial sacs. They are usually rounded, smooth, and firm; vary in size from a pea to a chestnut; and are mostly single. On section, they are foiuid to consist of a fatty central nucleus with a laminated fibrous envelope, usually of considerable thickness. They are apparently composed of one of the glandulee epiploicte, which has become detached, fallen loose into the peritoneal caHty, and become enveloped in plastic layers. SiGXS.—The signs of hernia, though varying considerably according to the contents of the sac and the condition in which it is placed, present in all cases many points in (common. There is an elongated or rotmded tumour at one of the usual abdominal apertures, broader below than above, where it is often naiTowed into a kind of neck ; usually increasing in size when the patient stands, holds his breath, coughs, or makes much muscular exertion. It can be pushed back into the abdomen on pressure, or goes back readily if the patient lie down, but reappears Avhen he stands up. On coughing, a strong and distinct impulse may be felt in it. When the hernia is altogether Intestinal, it is usually smooth, gurgling when pressed upon, sometimes tympanitic and rumbling, and resonant on percussion. It may be returned into the cavity of the abdomen Avith a distinct slip and gurgle ; it has a Avell-marked impulse on coughing, and is usually accompanied l)y various dyspeptic symptoms, and often Avith much dragging uneasiness. Omental Hernia is usually soft and doughy, returning sloAvly on pressure into the abdomen, feeling irregular on the surface, and httAung an ill-defined outline. It occurs most frequently on the left stde, and is rare in infants, in Avhom the omentum is short. In Entero-epiplocele there is a combination of the two conchtions and their signs ; but these arc usually so uncertain, that feAV6i6 JIERNJA. Surgeons care to jircdict before opening tlie sac wliat the probable nature of the contents may bo. Csacal Hernia necessarily occurs on tlie right side only. It is a large, knobby, and irregular tumour, irreducible, owing to the adhesions contracted by that portion of ccecum which is uncovered by peritoneum. The peculiarity of this hernia consists in the sac being absent, or only partial in the majority of cases, the peritoneum being stripped off as the gut descends. When this hernia is large, and partially invested by serous membrane, a sac usually exists at its upper aspect, into which a portion of small intestine may fall, and which may in some cases constitute a second hernia lying above or before the csecal one, ■which will be found situated at the posterior wall when this hernial pouch is opened. Occasionally the vermiform appendix and the caput coli are found in the sac, but can rarely be returned. The rule of caecal hernia having a partial peritoneal investment only, does not hold good in all cases; and instances have occasionally been met with in which this portion of intestine lay in a distinct sac. Hernia of the Bladder or Cystocele is very rare; and, like that of the caecum, is usually enclosed in a partial peritoneal investment, though it is not neces- sarily so. South states that there is a preparation at St. Thomas’s Hospital, in W'hich the fundus of the bladder, with its peritoneal covering, has passed into a distinct sac. In some instances the cystocele is accompanied by an enterocele. This hernia is always irreducible, is attended by a good deal of difficulty in urinating, with varying tension, according to the quantity of fluid con- tained ; by squeezing it, urine may be forced out through the m-ethra, and fluctuation has been felt in it. Urinary calculi have been formed in the tumour, and have been removed by incision through the scrotum, or have ulcerated out. Causes.—The causes of hernia are usually sufficiently well marked. In some instances the disease is congenital, arising from preternatural patency of the abdominal apertimes ; in other cases, it occurs at a later period of life, in con- sequence of some forcible effort, as lifting a heavy weight, jumping, coughing, straining at stool, or passing mine through a tight stricture. Such causes as these act especially in tall and dehcate people, particularly in those who have a natm-al disposition to weakness or bulging of the groins. The displacement of the abdominal viscera by a gravid tderus, will also occasionally give rise to the disease. Hernia is especially liable to be produced by a combination of causes : thus, if an aged person, one -with a feeble organisation, or whose abdominal apertures have been patent hi consequence of rathei sudden emaciation, make a violent effort, a hernial protrusion is a ery apt to occiu. Amongst the most frequent Predisposing Causes of hernia, are certainly sex, age, and occupation. g0x.—Men are more liable to this disease than ivomen, in the piopoition of about 4 or 5 to 1. Thus, according to Malgaigne, in France, one man in thirteen and one woman in fifty-two are the subjects of hernia. But, though men are more generally liable to hernia than women, they arc less so to certain forms of the disease, especially to the femoral and umbilical. It is to the inguinal that they are particularly subject. According to Lawrence, out ot 83,584 patients who applied to the City of London Truss Society, G/,D8 wereREDUCIBLE HERNIA. 617 males and lo,78C females. Of 43,-21-1 applicants at the same institution dm-iiig the emht years 18(;0-1HG7, 3G,1G1 were males and 7,07)3 females. Of these, 34,788 males and 3,085 females had ingiiiiial hernia; 1,373 males and 3,<)G8 females had femoral hernia. _ Age e.\crcises a very material influence upon the frequency of hernia. Mal- gaigne, who has carefully investigated this subject, finds that in infancy the disSise is sufficiently common, owing to the prevalence of congenital hernia at this period of life ; and, that in the first year after birth hernia occurs in the liroportion of 1 in every 21 children. It then goes on decreasing in frequency, there being 1 in 29 at the second year; 1 in 87 at the third year; until, at the thirteenth year, it has friUen to 1 in 77. Shortly after this, its fr-equency begins to rise again, and then goes on progressively increasing until the close of life ; thus, at the 21st year, there is one case in 32 ; at the 28th year, 1 in 21; at the 35th, one in 17 ; at the 40th, 1 in 9 ; at 50, 1 in G ; from GO to 70, 1 in 4 ; and fr-om 70 to 75, 1 in 3. In women, according to Malgaigne, hernia most fr’cqucntly occiu’s from the 20th to the 50th years.* Malgaigne’s figures give the ages of the patients when they came luider his observation. Ehngdoii has investigated the question of the ages at which the hernia commenced. He states that out of 9,29G cases, 5,G59, or GO.8 per cent., had commenced before 35, and 8,G37, or 39.2 per cent., after that age. The tendency to hernia is often hereditary, and congenital hernia is common in the children of hernial parents. Some races of men are less subject to hernia than others. Thus it is less fr'equent in the negro than in the white man, except in the ventral form. Occupation.—Those occupations in which the individual is exposed to violent muscular efforts, more particularly of an intermitting character, pre- dispose strongly to the occurrence of hernia ; and in these employments the tendency to the disease is often greatly increased by the injurious habit of wearing tight girths or belts round the waist, which, by constricting the ab- domen, throw the whole pressure of the abdominal contents upon the inguinal regions. CoxDiTioxs PEESENTED BY Heenia.—The Conditions in which a hernia may be foimd are very various, and entail corresponding differences in the result and treatment of the affection. When first formed, most hernim may be said to be Incomplete, being for a time retained within the orifice of the canal through which they eventually protrude. When they have passed alto- gether beyond the abdominal walls, they are said to be Complete; and this is the condition in vdiich they are usually presented to the Singeon. A hernia may also be Redmible, Irreducible, or Strangulated. REDUCIBLE HERNIA. A hernia is commonly at first Reducible; that is to say, it may readily be pushed back into the cavity of the abdomen, protruding again ivhen the patient stands up, holds his breath, or makes any exertion, and having a distinct and forcible impulse on coughing. Though the hernia contents, in these cases. elaborate article l>y A.6i8 HEllNJA. ai-c reducible into the abdomen, the sac is not; it almost immediately con- tracts adhesions to the areolar tissue, by-wliicli it is firmly fixed in its new situation ; though in some cases, as we shall hereafter see, it may be pushed back. Aitlicatiox of Truss.—In the Treatment of a reducible hernia, our object is, by the application of a proper truss, to retain the protrusion within the cavity of the abdomen. In order to do this, the patient must be provided with a proper kind of truss, adapted to the particular nature of the hernia. In umbilical and ventral ruptures, an elastic pad and belt may most con- veniently be used. In selecting the truss, care should be taken that the spring be of proper strength, adapted to the size and power of the individual; and that it be properly shaped, so that it docs not touch any part of the abdominal wall, but merely bears upon the points of pressure and counter- pressure. The pad should be convex, and firmly stuffed, and of sufficient size to press not only upon the external apertui’e, but upon the whole length of the canal. Before applying the truss, the hernia must be reduced, by placing the patient in the recumbent position, relaxing the muscles by bending the thigh upon the abdomen, and pressing the tumour back in the proper direction; the truss should then be put on, and be worn during the whole of the day; indeed, the patient should never be allowed to stand without wearing it. At night, it may either be left off altogether, or a lighter one applied. In some cases, the skin becomes irritated by the pressiu’c of the pad ; in these circumstances, an elastic air-cushion may be used, or the parts subjected to pressure may be well washed with spirit-lotion. The truss may be knonm to fit by testing it in the following way. The patient should be made to sit down on the edge of a chair, and then, extending his legs, opening them widely, and bending the body for- wards, cough several times. If the hernia do not now slip down behind the pad, we may be sure that the truss is efficient, and will keep the ruptme up in all ordinary circumstances. Radical Curb of Heraua.—Various means have been devised in order to effect the radical cure of a reducible hernia. The only plan that is at the same time perfectly safe and permanently successful, is the compression of a well- made truss. In this way, not unfrequently, the hernia of infants become radically cured ; the same result, however, seldom occurs at a more advanced period of life. In order that compression may succeed in this way, it is neces- sary that it should not only be applied to the external apertime through which the rupture escapes, but to the whole of the canal. It must also be continued for a very considerable time, at least a year or two, and care should be taken that diu-ing the treatment the rupture is not allowed to descend ; every time it comes down, any good that may have been derived is necessmily done aAvay with, and the treatment has to begin, as it were, anew. Radical cure of a hernia by truss-pressime can only be effected in those cases in which the abdo- minal aperture has been left congenitally weak or open. Hence it is only to be hoped for in children and very young adults, and only in those two congeni- tal forms of hernia—the mnbilical and the inguinal. The continued pressure of the truss-pad in these cases seems to determine those adhesive processes which are necessary for the closiu’e of one of the abdominal apeituies. the cm’c is supposed to hai e been effected in this way, the application of tlicWUTZEirS OPERATION. 619. truss must be coutinued for a very considerable length of time, lest by any unfortunate movement the ruptui’e descend again. • u The Operations that have been devised for the radical cure of hernia aie all founded on one of two principles ; viz., the excitation of such an amount of peritonitis in the sac, or its neck, as to cure its obliteration ;• or the plugging of the hernial aperture by invagination of the intcgumental tissues. If the accomplishment of these conditions would always prevent the recur- rence of the ruptiu-e, the radical cure might frequently be undertaken. But it is impossible to look upon the agglutination of the walls of the sac, or the closure of the abdominal aperture, as the sole conditions required. To accom- plish the radical cure, it would be necessary in many cases to effect changes in the shape and connections of the abdominal contents, to alter the size of the abdominal cavity, and indeed to modify in various ways many conditions inde- pendent of those immediately connected with the hernial protrusion. Many of the means of radical cmc, by which obliteration of the interior of the sac or of its neck is sought to be effected by the application of sutures or ligatures,, by the introduction of caustics, by excision, scarification, puncture, or injec- tion with tincture of iochne, are attended with so much danger from peritonitis, and are so seldom followed by any good results, that their consideration need not detain us here, the more so as they are universally abandoned by Siu’geons. of the present day. The operations that are now practised for the radical cure of hernia are con- ducted on two principal plans, however much they may be varied in their details by the ingenuity of particular Smgeons. The fii’st method of treatment consists of invaginating simply a portion of the scrotum, and fixing it in the inguinal canal, where it becomes adherent, and so occludes the aperture of exit. Of this kind of operation, Wutzer’s is- the best example. The second method of treatment consists in excising a portion of the integumental structines, and then by means of sutures attaching these and the deeper parts together, and thus leading to the consolidation of the canal. Of this. Wood’s operation is the best example. The following are the details of these procedures. Wutzer’s Operation.—The late C. W. Wutzer, of Bonn, adopted a plan of radically curing reducible inguinal hernige, combining the two principles on Avhich the older operations were fomided, viz., the agglutination of the neck of the hernial sac by the excitation of inflammation in it, and the closure of the inguinal canal by the invagination of the scrotum ; and he carried out these objects in a safer and more successful manner than by any of the methods pre- A'iously employed. His plan of treatment consists in introducing a plug of the scrotum into the ingiunal canal, and fixing it there by exciting adhesive inflam mation in the neck of the sac. The details of the operation are as follows, ihe patient lying on his back, and the hernia being reduced, the Sm’geoui pushes his index-finger up the inguinal canal as high as the internal ring, canying before it a cone of the scrotsd tissues ; a box-wood hollow cylinder, about four inches long (Fig. C), Avell oiled, is then pushed up as the finger is withdrawn, so as to occupy its place in the inguinal canal. Along the interior of this cylinder a flexible steel needle, gilt (A), fixed in a moA'able handle, is then pushed, so as to traverse the invaginated scirotum, the hernialHERNIA <520 sac, and the anterior abdominal wall, through which its point is caused to pro- trude. A conca^’e boxwood case (B) is then passed over the projecting point of the needle, and fixed by the other end by a screw apparatus to the cylinder (C), so as to compress the inclosed tissues. The apparatus so fixed is left in situ for six or eight days; when, some discharge being established, it is withdrawn, and the iiivaginated scrotal plug supported by lint introduced up its interior, and by a spica bandage tightly applied. The patient is kept quiet for a fortnight longer, when he is allowed to move about, wearing a light truss for three or four months. This method of treatment is easy of execution, and appears to be more suc- cessful than any that have preceded it. Yet it is open to the objections that •attend all plans for the radical cime of hernia; viz., the possible excitation of a dangerous amount of peritonitis ; and the want of adhesion between the lower part of the scrotal plug and the corresponding side of the inguinal canal and Ting, and consequent failure in the complete occlusion of the canal and in the radical cure. So far as the first objection is concerned, I believe that very little weight can be attached to it. I have very often performed this operation, and have never seen the slightest evidence of a disposition to peritoneal inflammation cr other local mischief, except abrasion of the skin in one or two cases. With respect to the second objection, there can be no doubt that failimes are not uufrequent ; but on the other hand successes are not rare, and I have now under observation several cases in which a complete ciu’e has resulted, although •several years, from two to nine, have elapsed since the operation. Wood’s Operation.—In order to secure the more complete obliteration of •the canal, and especially the cohesion of the inner and posterior walls, John Wood has brought forward another operation, for the follovdng description •of which I am indebted to him. The principle of this ■ method consists in the approximation of the tendinous structures forming the boundary of the hernial canal, by the application of a subcutaneous wire sutm-e through a puncture in the skin. In applying this principle to inguinal hernia, in order to promote the adhesion of the tendinous siu’faces, and to protect the sac and ■cord from injm’ious violence, the highly vascular, elastic, and tough fascia ot the scrotum is detached subcutaneously from the skin, transplanted by invagi- nation into the canal and held there by the ligatiu’es till adhesion ensues to ' the walls of the canal and to the spermatic cord. The wire is so applied as to obtain a fair hold in two places upon the structures forming the posterior wall, viz., the conjoined tendon and the triangulai’ aponemosis ; and again upon Poupart’s ligament and the lower portion of the external oblique ajDoneu xosis forming the anterior wall of the canal, hhe effect of the sutiue is to621 wo on's OPERA riox. close also the external abdominal ring, the pillars of which are included la L ™ By the close adhesion which is thus produced between Im posterior and anterior walls of the canal, the former is made to ^e th^ limb of a valve in preventing the descent of a henna into the canal, ihns. a permanent resistance to the reproduction of the rupture is provided,, which remains even after the temporarily effused lymph has been re-absorbed. The impulsive force of the abdominal contents tending to protrude at the- intenial ring, is resisted by the valve-like action of the posterior wall, and is not enabled to exert itself upon the recently formed adhesions. The use of the truss, except as a tempoi’ary adjunct in the cure, is londered unneces- sary by this operation. 0])ei-ation.—Hh.Q patient being laid on his back, with the shoulders well raised, and the pubes and scrotum shaved, the hernia must be reduced and held up by an assistant pressing upon the internal opening. The operator,, standing at that side of the patient whieh is about to be operated on, makes, with a small tenotomy-knife, an incision about three-fourths of an inch long- through the skin of the serotum over the lower part of the tumour ; or, if this, be large, about two and a half inches below the pubic spine. Then the knife, being inserted flativise between the skin and the faseia, is made to separate them ai-ound the incision over an area of about a two-ineh circle ; a pro- ceeding which the loose attachment of the skin easily allows. The knees of the patient should next be drawn up towards the abdomen, and held together- so as to relax the structures connected -with Poupart’s ligament. The fore- finger is next passed through the opening in the skin, and made to invaginate the detached fascia through the external ring into the canal, which is best done by using the right hand for the right side, and vica versa, keeping the- palm dhected forwards. The invagination of the fascia should be commenced from as low a point as the cutaneous incision will permit, so as to push the- invaginated finger as mi-ich as possible between the sac of the hernia and the- spermatic cord. When the finger is in the canal, its point should reach the- internal opening of the hernia, and the cord should be distinctly perceptible to it and protected by it. The point of the finger will then be placed behind the lower border of the internal oblique, and must render this point prominent at the surface by being hooked forward. The Surgeon will then be sensible of the edge of the conjoined tendon, raised in relief to the inner side of the iuvaginating finger, and in contact with its radial border. Next, the needle, stout, blunt-pointed, and curved, mounted on a strong handle, is to be- passed along the radial border of the finger as far as just beyond the- extreme joint, at which point it is made to pass through the conjoined tendon and tlic external oblique aponeurosis, till it is seen to raise the- skin. The latter is then to be drawn upwards and inwards as far as possible before the needle is pushed through it. Then a stout coppei- Avirc, silvered, about two feet long, and bent into a convenient hook at each end, is hooked on to the eye of the needle ; and the latter is withdrawn and unhooked, leaving the lower end of the wire in the scrotal incision, and the upper end in the groin-puucture. The iuvaginating finger is then- jilaccd on the outer side of the cord, behind Boupart’s ligament, as far from the border of the external ring as possible, raising the ligament on its point.622 HE UN I A. The needle is then passed along the ulnar border of the finger, and pushed through tlie external pillar close to l^upart’s ligament opposite to the internal ring, the skin being drawn outwards till the point of the needle appears at the former puncture, through which it is then pushed. The upper hoolc of the wire is then hooked on and drawn down with the needle into and throu-di the scrotal incision. Next, the spermatic cord opposite to the scrotal ind- sion is to be carelhlly separated from the sac of the hernia by the finger niid thumb, placed upon the skin in the same manner as in the operation foi ligaturing varicocele. The needle, detached again from the wire, is then passed into the lower angle of the scrotal incision, and made to travei-se the tissues between the cord and the hernial sac, and to emerge at the upper angle of the incision. The inner end of the ware is then hooked on to the needle and drawn with it across between the cord and sac. A little caie must heie be taken to avoid any kink in the wire, which must be drawn down until the part which remains in the wound is quite straio-ht. The ends of the wire are then twisted to the extent of three turns, which it will be found useful, when removing the wire, always to make in the same direction. Traction is then made upon the wire loop wfrich remains in the groin-punctm-e. This will be found to invaginate the sac and scrotal fascia, and to close up the pillars of the external abdominal ring. The loop must then be twisted by three firm turns well drawn into the groin-puncture. Then the long ends of the wire, being cut off to a suitable length, are to be passed together through the loop bent down to meet them and hooked on to it. Under the arch thus formed a stout pad of lint is placed, and the whole is held firmly by a spica bandage. The patient, after the operation, should be placed in bed with the shoulders well raised and the knees bent over a bolster. Any discharge which forms has a free escape downwards, and may be received upon a sponge steeped in some antiseptic fluid. The scrotum should be either suspended in a turn of the bandage, or kept up by a small cushion or strap of plaster. The wires should be kept in from fomdeen to twenty-one days, according to the amount of solid effrision which subsequently occurs. Any pain in the abdomen should be allayed by opiates and fomentations, and by slackening or removing the bandage after forty-eight hours. Pain sometimes results fr'om including the ilio-inguinal nerve, which must not be mistaken for the pain of peritonitis. Wood had up to 1872 operated in nearly 200 instances, and estimated his successful results in cases of all degrees of severity at about sixty-five per cent. In young persons the results have been still more favourable, and he now confines the operation to patients below the age of thirty, unless in special circumstances. Three deaths have resulted from pyaemia and peritonitis. lEBEDXJCIBLBJ HEENIA. Irreducible Herniae are usually of old date, and of large size. They gene- rally contain a considerable quantity of thickened omentum, as wall as intestine and mesentery. In many instances, a rupture of this kind is partly reducible, the greater portion remaining unreduced. It is usually the gut which slips up, and the omentum that cannot be returned.623 INFLAMED IRllEDUGJBLE HERNIA. (VvusESOFliiiiEDUCimuTY.-The irrcclucibilitj of a rupture maybe de- pendent on either its on the existence of adlmions ox on its ^ery nalure If the sac become the scat of an hour-glass contraction, or its nec' become elongated and narrowed, the hernial contents may continue per- manently protruding.

Hernite of the cfficum and bladder can never be returned, on account of the anatomical conditions, to which reference has already been made. .Sy.wPTOMS.—An irreducible hernia is usually a source of gi’eat incon- venience ; it has a tendency to increase if left to itself, until at last it may contain, as in some extreme cases it has been found to do, the greater portion of the abdominal viscera, forming an enormous tumour, inconvenient by its size and weight, in which the penis and scrotum are buried. Even when the irreducible hernia is of small size, it gives rise to a sensation of weakness in the part, with dragging pains, and is very frequently accompanied by colicky sensations and dysjieptic derangements. The patient also, in these circum- stances, is in a state of considerable danger lest the ruptm-e become strangulated by violent efforts, or injured and inflamed by blows. Treatment.—For the above reasons it is necessary not only to protect a ruptmn of this kind from external violence, ljut to endeavour to prevent its increase in size. This may best be done by letting the patient wear a truss with a large concave pad, which supports and protects it ; provided the rupture be not of too great a size for the application of such an instrument. If its magnitude be very considerable, it must be supported by means of a suspensory bandage. Bransby Cooper has recommended that an attempt should be made to convert the irreducible into a reducible hernia, by keeping the patient in bed for several weeks, on low diet, with the continued appli- cation of ice to the tumour ; and, if it contain much omentum, giving smaU doses of blue pill and tartar emetic, so as to promote the absorption of the fat. For these remedies I have advantageously instituted the iodide of potassium. This plan, which appears to have answered well in some cases, certaiidy deserves a further trial. Inflamed Irreducible Hernia.—The occurrence of inflammation in an irreducible hernia is a serious complication, and one that simulates strangu- lation very closely. When this complication occurs,' the part becomes swollen, hot, tender, and painful; there is not much tension in the tumour, which is seldom increased beyond its usual magnitude ; there is a good deal of pyrexia, and symptoms of peritonitis spreading from the vicinity of the inflamed rupture set in. In some cases there is vomiting ; but it is not constant, and never feculent, occun’ing generally early in the disease, and consisting principally of the contents of the stomach ; being apparently an effort of nature to get rid of an indigestible meal. If there be constipation, as usually happens in all cases of peritonitis, it is not complete, flatus occasionally passing fer amm, together with a small quantity of fluid faeces. It is of im-624 HERNIA. poitiiucG ill tlicsc cases to ol)scr\c tliat the iiiflaniination comiiieiices in the body of the sac, and extends into those parts of the abdomen that are eon- tiguous to its nock ; the stomachal and intestinal derangements being secondary to this consideration. The Treatment of an inflamed irreducible heniia must be directed to the peritonitis which attends it. The application of leeches over the sac and its neck, the free administration of calomel and opiimi, and the employment of enemata^ with strict antiphlogistic regimen and rest, will usually speedily subdue all inflammatory action. Incarcerated Hernia.—An iiTeduciblc hernia occasionally becomes ob- structed, then constituting the condition termed mcarreraiecl hernia. This condition principally occurs in old people, from the accumulation of flatus, or of undigested matters, such as cheny-stones or mustard-seeds, in an angle of the gut. In these cases there is constipation, with eructation, and perhaps occasional vomiting. There may be some degree of pain, weight, or uneasiness about the tumoiu'; but there is no tension in it or in its neck, and the symptoms altogether are of a chronic and snbaente character. The Treatment of such a case as this should consist in the administration of a good purgative injection ; the compound colocynth enema is the best, thrown up as high as possible by means of a long tube. Ice may then be applied to the tumour for about half an horn-; and the taxis, as will afterwards be described, may be used under chloroform. The ice may be omitted in those cases in which, on handling the tumour, giu’gling can readily be felt; but the taxis should always be used, as by it the incarcerated gut may be partially emptied of its contents ; or if any additional protrusion should have slipped down, this may be returned. After these means have been employed, an active purgative, either of calomel or of croton-oil and colocynth, should be administered ; and, if any inflammation ensue, this must be treated as ah’eady described. STRANGULATED HERNIA. A hernia is said to be Strangulated when a portion of gut or omentum that is protruded.is so tightly constricted that it cannot be returned into the abdomen ; having its functions arrested, and, if not relieved speedily, running into gangrene. This condition may occur at all periods of life, being met with in infants a few days old, and in centenarians. It commonly arises from a sudden violent effort, by which a fresh portion of intestine is forcibly pro- truded into a pre’V'iously 'existing hernia, which it distends to such a degi’ee as to produce strangulation. But, though old hemim are more subject to this condition than recent ones, it may occur at the very first formation of a hernial swelling, the gut becoming strangled as it is protruded. There are therefore two distinct kinds of strangulation. One may be said to be of a passive kind, , chiefly occunlng in elderly people, the subjects of old and perhaps irreducible hernia ; which, in consequence of some accidental circumstance, becomes dis- tended by the descent of a larger portion of intestine than usual, and this, nndero-oing constriction and compression at the neck of the sac, gradually j become strangulated. The other kind of strangulation is most frequent m625 SEAT OF STRICTURE. younger ind.iTicIua.ls ; in it tlic symptoms arc more active, the bowel becoming protruded in consequence of violent exertion, and undergoing rapid strangu- lation, the tension of the parts not having been lessened by the previous long existence of an irreducible hernia. jMechanism of Straxgulatiox.—Strangulation has been attributed either to a spasmodic action of the walls of the aperture through which the hernia protrudes, or to changes taking place in the protruded parts, subsequent to and occasioned by their constriction by the tissues external to them. The strangulation cannot, .1 think, ever be regai'ded with justice as of spasmodic character ; the aperture in the abdominal wall, through which the hernia escapes, being tendinous or fibrous, and certainly not in any way contractile, though the action of the abdominal muscles may undoubtedly increase the tension of its sides. The continued and permanent character of the strangu- lation, when once it has taken place, would also discountenance this opinion ; those forms of hernia, indeed, as the ventral, which occur in purely muscular structures, are very rarely strangulated, and, when they are so, the constriction is generally occasioned by the formation of dense adventitious bands upon or within the sac, and not by any muscular agency. Strangulation is characterised by congestion of the protruded parts, induced by the constriction to which they are subjected ; the mechanism being as follows. A knuckle of intestine, or piece of omentum, is suddenly protruded during an effort of some kind. This immediately becomes compressed by the sides of the narrow aperture thi’ough which it has escaped ; the return of its venous blood is consequently interfered with, and sweUing and oedema rapidly ensue, together wdth 'stagnation of the blood in it. If the constriction be excessively tight, the walls of the ring being very hard and shaiq), the part that is so strangulated may be deprived of its vitality in the course of a few hours. If the strangulation be less severe, the congestion will run into inflammation, the changes characteristic of this condition speedily supervening. In proportion as the congestion augments, and the inflammation comes on, the return of the protruded parts is necessarily ren- dered more difficult by the increase of their swelling. Seat of Strictueb. — The stricture is most commonly situated outside the neck of the sac, in the tendinous or ligamentous structiues surround- ing it; not unfrequently in the altered and thickened subserous areolar tissue. In other cases, and indeed with great fi-equency, it is met with in the neck of the sac itself (Fig. C73), which is nar- rowed, elongated, and tubular ; or constricted by bands that arc incorporated Avith it. More rarely it exists in the body of the sac, Avhich may have assumed an hour-glass shape. In some cases, it would appear as if this particular shape Avere owino- to an old hernia having been pushed doAvn by a recent one above it. The stricture is sometimes, though by no means frequently, met with inside the Fig. 673.—Stricture in the Neck of tile Bae, laid open. VOL, ir. sac, consisting of bands626 HERNIA. of adhesions stretching across this, or of the indurated edge of an aperture of the omentum tlirough which a portion of the gut has slipped. liOCAL Effects of STRAEauLATiON.—The changes induced in the strangu- lated parts result from the pressure of the stricture, and the consequent inter- ference ^vith the cirmxlation through them. If the strangulation be acute, that portion of intestine which lies immediately under the stricture will be seen to be nipped or mai-kcd by a deep sulcus, occasioned partly by the pressure to which it has been subjected, and partly by the swelling of the congested tissues beyond it. The changes that take place in the protruded intestine rapidly increase in proportion to the duration of the strangulation. The tightness of the stricture and the acuteness of the strangulation have, however, even more to do with these changes than its duration. I have seen the bowel so tightly nipped that, though the strangulation had only existed eight hom’s when the operation was performed, the vitality was lost in the part constricted (Fig. 07!)) ; and in other cases I have known the part to re- cover itself, although strangulation had lasted for five or six days before the operation was performed. The first change that takes place in the protruded parts in the case of strangulated hernia is their this rapidly runs on to inflammation, and speedily terminates in gangrene. The protruded bowel becomes, at first, of a claret, morone, or pm-plish-brown colour, sometimes ecchymosed on the surface, with thickening and stiffening of its coats, owing to effusion into their substance ; some liquid is also usually poured out into its interior. In this stage, that of congestion, the omentum -will also be found with its veins a good deal congested. When inflammation has set in, the bowel preserves the same colour as in the congested condition, but usually becomes coated here and there with flakes of lymph, which gives it a rough and viUous look ; the omentum has a somewhat rosy tinge, and there is usually a good deal of reddish fluid poured out into the sac. AVhen gangrene occurs, the bowel loses its lustre and polish, becoming of an ashy grey, or dull black colour, soft and somewhat lacer- able, so that its coats readily separate from one another ; the serous membrane especially peeling off. The omentum is dark pm-plish, or of a kind of dull yellowish-grey ; and there is usually a considerable quantity of dark turbid serum in the sac, the whole contents of which are extremely offensive. Most usually, when gangi’ene occurs in a strangulated rupture, inflammation of the sac and its coverings takes place, accompanied, after a time, by a reddish-blue or congested appearance and some tenderness on pressure ; and, if the part be left imreduced, eventually by emphysematous crackling. If the case be left without being relieved, gangi-ene of the skin will at last take place ; the sac driving way, and the fecal matters being discharged tfeough the softened and disintegrated tissues. In such circumstances as these—which, however, are very rjwely met wth at the present day—the patient usually eventually dies of low peritonitis, from extension of the inflammation to the serous mem- , brane. No effusion, however, of feculent matter will take place into the peritoneal cavity, even under such favourable conditions ; the portion of bowel immediately wthin the stricture becomes adherent by plastic matter to the peritonemn on its internal surface, and thus the escape of any extravasation into the cavity of the abdomen is prevented. It does not always folIoA\ tha627 SYMPT02fS OF STRAFGULATIOK there is any external evidence of the occurrence of gangrene within the sac ; JUKI the bowel is i'requently nipped to such an extent as to prevent its regain- ing its vitality, vnthont any iiniisiial condition being presented until the sac is actually laid open and the intestine examined. The fUiiil contained in the hernial sac undergoes changes in appearance and •chai-acter, corresponding to those which take place in the strangled gut. In •earlier and slighter cases it continues clear and but moderately abundant. Sometimes the quantity increases greatly and rapidly, but more commonly the •chief alteration that takes place is in its character. It becomes reddish or brown in colour from transuded blood. Sometimes even pure blood is found in the sac, and I have seen the protruded intestine invested with a layer of •coa^uliun. It gangrene of the gut take place, the fluid becomes tiiibid, daik, and offensive. Suppuration in the sac is very rare. I have only once met with it in a woman, 32 years of age, three months pregnant, who was suffering from an acutely strangulated femoral hernia of sixty hom’s’ dm’ation. In that •case, the taxis had been freely used. Fluctuation could be felt deeply, there was diffused doughy infiltration of the groin, and on opening the sac it was found filled with dark thick pus—about half an ounce ; at the bottom of which lay a small deeply congested but not gangrenous knuckle of intestine, which was replaced after the division of a very slight stricture. The patient Tecovered. In the more advanced cases of strangulated hernia, the peritoneum always becomes inflamed, usually to a considerable extent; the disease affects a diffuse form, and is accompanied by the effusion of tmbid serum, often of a very •acrid and irritating character, and mixed with flakes of lymph, sometimes to such an extent as to give it a truly puriform appearance. This glutinous lymph mats together contiguous coils of intestine, often appearing to be smeared over them hke so much melted butter. SvirPTOirs.—The signs and symptoms of strangulation are of two kinds : 1. The local ones, affecting the Tumom-; and 2. The general ones, influencing the Constitution. 1. Local Signs.—The tumour, if the hemia be an old one, wiU be found to be increased in size ; or it may have appeared for the first time. At the moment of strangulation it will generally be found to be hard, tense, and rounded, more particularly if it be an enterocele. When, however, the hernia is in a great measure omental, it is not unfr-equently soft and doughy, though strangulated. It seldom increases in size after strangulation has occurred, as no fresh protrusion can take place below the stricture ; but I have knovm it to be greatly augmented in bulk after the strangulation had existed for some hours, by the effusion of serum into the sac. If the hemia have previously been reducible, it can no longer ]>e put back ; and there is no impulse in it nor increase in its size on coughing, the stricture preventing the transmission •of the .shock to the contents of the tumour ; and in this way, as pointed out by Luke, the situation of the constriction may sometimes be ascertained lay observing at what point the impulse ceases. 2. Constitutional Symptoms.—So soon as the strangulation has occurred, intestinal obstruction takes place, and the patient becomes uneasy and restless. If the constriction be of an active character, he will be seized with acute pain s 8 2628 I JIEllNIA. iu the part, which speedily extends to the contiguous portion of tlie abdomen,, assuming the characters of peritoneal inflammation. a''he first thin<>' that happens when intestine is strangulated, whether a large coil bo constricted, or a small portion only of the diameter of the gut he nipped, is an arrest of the- peristaltic movement of the part implicated ; and the occuiTence of obstruction to the onward course of the intestinal contents is followed by constipation, vomiting, and colicky pains. The constipation is always complete, neither fmces nor flatus passing through ; the bowels may sometimes act once after the- strangulation has occiUTed from that portion which lies below the seat of con- striction, but they cann,ot, of course, empty themselves thoroughly, nor fronr above the strangled part. Vomiting usually sets in early, and is often very severe and continuous, with much retching and straining ; at first the contents of the stomach are ejected, with some bilious matters, but afterwards the vomiting becomes fecu- lent, or stercoraceous. The cause of feculent vomiting has usually been sup- posed to be an inverted peristaltic action of the intestines. But the observations- ' of Dr. Brinton seem to throw much doubt on the coiTCctness of this time- honoured view. Dr. Brinton maintains that in vomiting, the result of ' obstructed or strangulated intestine, the peristaltic action is not inverted—that it continues to be direct—but that when the intestinal contents meet -with the obstruction, they undergo a kind of churning, and that a central upward current takes place ; the contents of the bowel being forced upwards by the pressure of the accumulated substances at the seat of obstruction, and conse- quently behind them. The vomiting is attended by colicky and dragging pains; about the navel. These symptoms are more severe in their character when the strangulation is acute and the hernia is intestinal, than when it is passive, and the rupture omental. They occur equally in the incomplete and the complete forms of the disease ; indeed, it not nnfrequently happens that the hernial; tumour may be so small as to have escaped observation ; the occurrence of the above-mentioned symptoms being the first indication of the probable nature of the mischief. Hence, it is well always to examine for hernia when called to a patient suddenly seized Avith constipation, vomiting, and colicky pains, even if told that no tumour exists. After the strangulation has existed for some time, the inflammation that occui-s in the sac extends to the contiguous peritoneum, accompanied by the- ordinary signs of peritonitis, such as tension of the abdominal muscles, ten- derness, with lancinating pains about the abdomen, and tympanitis. The- patient lies on his back with the knees drawn up, has a small, hard, quick, and perhaps intermittent pulse, a diy tongue which speedily becomes brown, and a- pale, anxious, and dragged countenance, with a good deal of heat of the skin, and inflammatory fever. In some cases, this is of a sthenic type ; but, in the- majority of instances, especially in feeble subjects, it assumes the inltati'se- form. When gangrene of the ruptm’e takes phice, hiccup usually comes on, i with sudden cessation of pain in the tumour, and intermittent pulse, cold sweats, pallor, anxiety, rapid sinking of the vital powers, usually with slight dehrium ; and death speedily ocem’s. Modifications of Symptoms.—The symptoms just described ai-e those-DIAGNOSIS OF STRANGULATED HERNIA. 629 which arc usuaUy met vnth in strangulated hernia. They may, however, be modified in some important respects. , , i i, • 1. There may be little or no tension in a strangulated hernia, the tumour continuing soft and lax ; this is especially the case when the hernia contains omentum, and in congenital hernias when strangulated. It may also occur in the case of double herni® on the same side, in consequence of the outer sac beino- empty, or merely fiUed vnth serum, and the posterior one being pro- tnided against this and strangulated, but its tension being masked by the lax state of the outer one. i i • <- 2. Vomiting sometimes does not take place from first to last, there being at> mo'st a little retching ; at other times the patient vomits once or twice, and then there is no recurrence of this symptom so long as he remains quiet, and keeps the stomach empty ; but, on moving or taking noiu’ishment of any kind, oven fluids, it comes on again, and thus the Surgeon may elicit this symptom, .should it be necessary in a diagnostic point of ’^dew. 3. Extensive peritonitis, with copious effusion of a puriform liquid, may occm’ without any pain, and with but little tenderness and no elevation of iemperatiire ; the anxiety of countenance and sharpness of pulse being the only symptoms that lead to a suspicion of its existence. 4. Death may result from exhaustion consequent on vomiting and peritonitis, without any sign of gangrene in the constricted portion of intestine. Diagnosis.—The diagnosis of strangulated hernia requires to be made from the following conditions. 1. Obstructed Irreducible Hernia.—In this there are no acute symptoms, and the rupture will generally be found to be a large one of old standing. It may become somewhat tense and swollen, but is not tender to the touch, and always presents a certain degree of impulse on coughing. There is no sign of peritonitis. There may be constipation ; but there is no vomiting, or, if there be any, it is simply mucous and bihous, consisting of the contents of the stomach. The speedy restoration of the intestinal action, by the treatment already indicated as proper in these cases, mil remove any doubt as to the nature of the affection. 2. Inflamed Irreducible Hernia.—Here there are great tenderness and pain in the tumour, with pyi-exia, and some general peritonitis, but there is no vomiting ; or, if the patient have vomited once or tmee, he does not continue to do so with the same degree of 'sdolence, or in the same quantity, as he would if the peritonitis were the result of strangulation. Again, the constipation is not absolute and entire, but flatus and hquid fasces will usually pass. 3. General Peritonitis conjoined with Hernia.—Here the diagnosis is often extremely difficult, especially if the hernia be an irreducible one. In these cases, however, it will be observed that the peritonitis may be most intense at a distance from the sac ; that there will be little or no vomiting, or, if there be, that it is simply of mucus and the contents of the stomach j and that the constipation is by no means obstinate or insiu'mountable by ordinary moans. 4. In Double Hernia, one tumoiu’ may be strangulated and the other not, though iireducible. In these circumstances, it may at first be a little difficultHERNIA. 630 to determine which one is the seat of constriction. This, however, may be iiscertamed by observing greater tension and tenderness about the neck of the- straugidated than of the imconstricted hernia. 5. The co-existence of Early Pregnancy, or a tlireatened Miscarriage may obscure the diagnosis, the Surgeon possibly being in doubt whether the vomiting is dependent on the state of the uterus or on the strangulation of the hernia. Here it may be stated generally that the vomiting of pregnancy never becomes stercoraceous ; that constipation, if it exist, does not resist the action of apeiients or enemata ; and that the local signs of strangulation are usually well marked. ^ Besides these various conditions of hernia, which may be confounded ■with strangulation, there are other tumours which may Ije mistaken for this disease j but these we shall have to consider when speaking of the special forms of hernia. Treatment.—The treatment of strangulated hernia is one of the most important subjects in surgery. The object sought to be accomplished is the- removal of the constriction from the strangled hernial tumom*. This is effected ; either by the Reduction of its Contents by Taxis ; or by the Division of the- ; Stricture. j Taxis.—The reduction of the hernia is effected by the employment of the i taxis, by which is meant the various manual procediu’es employed in putting 1 the rupture back. The taxis, when properly performed, is seldom attended by any serious consequences to the patient. I have never known it followed by death ; and, out of 293 cases of hernia reported by Luke, as having been reduced by the taxis in the London Hospital, none died. It is not unfi’equently followed, however, by rather a shaip attack of peritonitis, which might pro- bably, in some instances, prove fatal; in one instance, I have seen it followed by very abundant hmmorrhage from the bowel, probably owing to the rupture- of some of the congested vessels of the strangled portion of the gut. In using the taxis, great care should in all cases be employed, and no undue force- should ever be had recom-se to. Ho good can ever be effected by violence : the resistance of the ring cannot be overcome by forcible pressure ; and a vast deal of harm may be done by squeezing against it the tender and inflamed gut,, causing this to overlap, and thus to be bruised, or even perhaps torn. The taxis should not be prolonged beyond half an hour ; if it be properly employed for this time, the hernia, if reducible, ■will probably go back. If it be apphed, as it is often very improperly, for a lengthened period, and by several Surgeons in succession, the protruded part becomes ecchymosed, irritated, and disposed to inflammation ; and the chances of recovery after a subsequent operation are much lessened. When the parts are much inflamed, the taxis shoifld be- employed mth great caution ; and, if it have been fanly and fully used by another Surgeon, it is better not to repeat it. When gangrene has occurred,, the taxis should never be employed ; as the putting back of the mortified gut 1 into the abdomen would be followed by extravasation of ffeces and Altai peri- tonitis. In using the taxis, it should be borne in mind that there are two obstacles to overcome ; the resistance of the parts around the ring, and the bulk of the tumom’. The first may be somewhat lessened by relaxing the abdominal631 TAXIS AXD AUXILIARY MEASURES. muscles, aiicl consequently diminishing the tension exercised upon the tendino^ apertures and fasciie of the groin. In order to effect this, the patient should be placed in a proper position, the body being bent forwards, the thigh ad- ducted, and semi-flexed upon the abdomen ; the Surgeon may then, by employ- ing steady pressure on the tumour, endeavour to squeeze out some of the flatus from the strangled portion of intestine, and thus to effect its reduction. In doing this, the^neck of the sac should be steadied Ijy the fingers of the left hand ; whilst, with the right spread over the tumour, the Surgeon endeavours to push it backwards, using a kind of kneading motion, and sometimes in the first instance drawing it slightly downwards, so as to disentangle it from the neck of the sac. The direction of the pressm-e is important; it should always be in the fine of the descent of the tumour. These means may be employed as soon as the patient is seen by the Surgeon, when, by steadily carrying on the taxis for a few minutes, he ‘will perhaps hear and feel a gurgling in the tumour, which will be followed by its immediate reduction. If the patient be thin, and the outline of the aperture through which the hernia escapes toler- ably defined, the protrusion may be reduced, after failure of the taxis in the ordinary way, by passing the tip of the finger or the nail under the edge of the ring, and pulling this firmly and forcibly on one side, so as to steady and at the same time dilate it, pressiue being kept up on the tumoiu with the other hand. This manoeuvre can be practised with more facility and success in femoral hernia, where the upper edge of the saphenous opening is sharply defined, but may also successfully be had recourse to in inguinal and umbilical protzTisions. In some cases reduction appears to have been facilitated by placing the patient on his head and shoulders, and raising the body in the vertical position whilst the taxis was being employed. Should, however, reduc- tion not ensue, it will be desirable to have recourse at once to further means, the object of which is, by relaxing the muscles and lessening the bulk of the tumour, to enable the hernia to be reduced. Auxiliary Measures.—The means to be employed must be modified ac- cording to the condition of the strangulation, whether it be of the active or of the passive kind. If it be very acute, occurring in a young, robust, and other- wise healthy subject, the patient may have about tivelve or sixteen ounces of blood taken away from the arm ; he should then be put into a hot bath, where he may remain for twenty minutes or half an hour, or until he feels faint; and, whilst he is in the bath in this condition, the taxis should be employed. If it do not succeed, he should be taken out, wrapped up in blankets, and have chloroform administered. When he is fully under the infiuence of this agent, uhich is certainly the most efficient which we possess for relaxing muscular contraction, the ta.xis may be tried once again. Should it still fail, operation should be immediately proceeded with. No good can possibly come of delay in these cases, and repeated attempts at the taxis should be carefully avoided. If the hernia do not admit of reduction in the early stage of the strangulation, it will necessarily be much less likely to do so when the parts, squeezed and biuised much by manipulation, wiU have had their congestive condition greatly increased. The frequent employment of the operation without opening the sac, of late years, very properly renders Surgeons much less averse to early dn ision of the stricture than was formerly the case.632 HERNIA. When the strangulation is less acute, or occurs in a more aged or less robust subject, it is well to omit the bleeding, and to trust to the warm bath and chloroform. ^\Tien the strangulation is of a passive character, and occurs in feeble or elderly people, other measures may be adopted with the view of lessening the buUc of the tumour ; which, rather than the tension of the parts, offers the chief obstacle to reduction in these cases. In such circumstances, especially when the tumoui’ is large and not very tense, it is well to dispense with the hot-bath, which has sometimes a tendency to increase any congestion that may ah’eady exist in the hernia ; I have in more than one case seen a strangulated rupture enlarge considerably after the employment of the bath. In such cases, more time may safely be spent in attempts at reduction than in very acutely strangulated hernim. It is a useful practice to commence the treat- ment by the administration of a large enema ; which, by emptying the lower bowel, will alter the relations of the abdominal contents, and may materially facilitate the reduction of the tumour. The best enema is one ot gruel and castor-oil, with some spirits of turpentine added to it; it should be injected through a full-sized tube, passed high up into the gut, and with a moderate degree of foi’ce. In administexlug it, care must be taken that no injmy be done to the bowel. It would scarcely be necessary to give such a caution as this, were it not that I was summoned, some years ago, by two very excellent practitioners, to see a woman with strangulated femor^ hernia, to whom an enema of about two quarts of tepid water had been ad- ministered ; and as this had not returned, and did not appear to have gone up the bowel, they suspected that it must have passed out of the rectum into the suiTounding areolar tissue. As the patient, however, did not seem to be suffering from this cause, and as the symptoms of strangulation were ingent, I operated on the hernia. Death suddenly occurred, apparently from ex- haustion, in about eight hours; and, on examining the body, it was found that the rectum had been perforated, and the fluid injected into the meso- rectum, separating the gut from the sacrum, whence it had extended into the general subperitoneal areolar tissue, which contained a quantity of the liquid ; some of the water also appeared to have entered the peritoneal cavity. In the large hernim of old people, more particularly the umbdical, in which there is a good deal of flatus, after the enema has been administered, a bladder of ice may be applied for thi’ee or fom’ hours with excellent effect. Chloroform may then be given, and the taxis employed under its influence. Of late years, indeed, I have been in most cases in the habit of trusting almost solely to chloroform as a relaxing agent, and have often even dispensed with the use of the warm bath. If however, this can be conveniently used without too much delay, it should be employed. After this, I put the patient at once under chloroform, and then try the taxis for a period not exceeding half an horn-: if this fail, the operation should be done without making any further attempts at reduction, which are not only useless, but injm-ious by bruising the pro- truded parts. Persistence of Symptoms after Iteductiou.—After the reduction of the hernia, the symptoms of strangulation may continue unabated. This unto- wai’d occurrence may arise from four distinct conditions : 1. The hernia mayTREATMENT OF SYAIPTOMS AFTER REDUCTION'. 633 navo been reauced in mass (vuh p. 052, Vol. H.) ; 2. An internal strangula- lion has existed Avithin the sac—the taxis having overcome the external stric- ture, but failing to influence that within the sac ; 3. The gut may have been so severely nipped that, although all constriction has been removed, the peristaltic action is not restored, the constricted portion of bowel falling into a state of gangrene ; 4. A second hernia may exist in a state of strangulation, which has escaped detection. The diagnosis of these several conditions may possibly be made by atten- tion to the following circumstances. In the reduction in mass the tumour has slipped up without any gurgle ; the canal is very open, and no trace of sac can be felt in it, but a rounded tumour, possibly at the upper part, on coughing. In the case of internal adhesions there will have been no 'gurgling, but the caual is still filled by the sac ; the abdominal apertures are not pretcrnaturally patent and distinct. In the case of extreme nipping and consequent paralysis of a portion of the gut, gurgling will have been felt and heard in effecting the taxis, Avhich does not happen in either of the other conditions, and the symptoms of intestinal obstruction will not be quite complete. The vomiting will lose its stercoraceous character, and probably some flatus will pass. In the case of the co-existence of a second hernia in a state of strangulation, the 'Cause of the continuance of the symptoms may be ascertained by careful ■examination of the abdominal walls. It is especially the co-existence of a small .femoral with a large umbilical or inguinal hernia that is apt to be overlooked. This I have seen .happen in a very fat person. A man was admitted into University College Hospital with strangulated inguinal hernia. It was reduced by the house-surgeon, but the symptoms persisted, and the patient died un- relieved, there being no indication for operation. After death a very small piece, half a knuckle, of intestine was found strangulated in the crural canal of the same side. The patient being extremely fat, this strangulation was not detected, and could not be recognised during life. The folds of the groin should be very carefully examined in all these cases. The Treatment of these different conditions is full of difficulty and of anxiety to the Siugeon. As a general rule, I think that the proper practice in all cases when the symptoms of strangulation, especially stercoraceous vomiting, continue unrelieved and undiminished in severity for some hom’s after the ap- parent reduction of the hernia, is to cut down upon the canal, expose the sac, and, if that be found still strictured, as will be explained at p. 637, Vol. II., divide the constriction. Should the hernia not have been reduced “ in mass,” it might possibly be found that a small knuckle of intestine is still gripped at the inner and deeper ring ; but should that not be the case, it wiU, I think, be safer not to push any exploration into the abdominal cavity with the vieAV of discovering the possible existence of unrelieved internal strangulation, the presence of which would be highly problematical, and, if existing, could scarcely admit ol discovery. The safer and wiser plan under such circum- stances appears to be, to leave the wound open, with a poultice and a light compress over it, and to give the patient the chance of the formation of an artificial anus on the sloughing of the strangulated or badly nipped knuckle of intestine ; a result that I have more than once witnessed about the fourth or fifth day, the patient ultimately recovering.<>34 HERNIA. In some cases, Avliere the nipping of the strangulated intestine has been severe, yet not sufficient to an-cst permanently the peristaltic action or to destroy its vitality, constipation and retching, with nausea, may continue ; and the tmnour, if the hernia have been small and deeply seated (more particularly if lemoral), may continue to be felt, though loss tense than before ; consisting simply of the thickened and inflamed sac, with serous fluid in it. In these circumstances, we must be careffil not to operate, I have, on two or throe occasions, seen an empty sac operated on to the annoyance of the Surgeon and danger of the patient. The mistake may be avoided by observing that the symptoms gradually lessen in severity by waiting, and that the tympanitis subsides, the abdomen becoming flat and supple. The length of time during which the congestive condition of the bowel wiU continue after a strangulated portion of intestine has been reduced, is very considerable. In a case of strangulated femoral hernia W'hich was some time ago under my care, reduction was effected, but, strangulation recurring at the end of twelve days, an operation became necessary ; this was performed, and the patient died on, the eighth day after it, or the twenty-first from the first strangulation. On examination, the small intestine was found congested in two distinct portions, each of which was about eight inches in length ; several feet of healthy gut intervening between them. One of these eongested por- tions lay opposite the wound, and was evidently the intestine that was last strangulated. The other was altogether away from the seat of operation, but was equally darkly congested, being almost of a black colour, and was clearly that portion which had been constricted some time previously; and which, although twenty days had elapsed, had not as yet recovered itself. When a second strangulated hernia exists it, of coiu’se, must either be reduced by the taxis, or the operation practised on it. After the taxis has been fairly employed for a sufficient time, and has not succeeded in reducing the hernia, the operation must be proceeded with. It is impossible to lay down any definite rule as to the time that it is prudent to continue efforts at reduction; but it may be stated generally that, after the different adjuvents of the taxis Avhich the Siu’geon may think it desirable to apply have been fairly tried and have failed, the operation should be under- taken without further delay. There are few Siu’geons who 'wiU not at once acknowledge the truth of the remark of the late Hey of Leeds—that he had often regretted perform in g this operation too late, but never having done it too earlv. It is true that cases are occasionally recorded, in which after foiu- or five days of treatment the hernia has gone up ; but it is very rare to meet with such cases in practice; and, in all probability, in delaying the operation in the hope of finding one such case, the lives of dozens of patients would be sacri- ficed. Luke has shown, as the result of the experience at the London Hospital, that the ratio of mortahty increases greatly in proportion to the length of (time during which the strangulation is allowed to continue.

Not only is time lost in this way, but the bowel is often bruise and injimoiisly squeezed, so that the inflammation already cxistin^ in it i^ considerably increased. OPERATION FOR. STBANaULATED HERNIA The operation for strangulated hernia maybe performed ni two ways; either by opening the sac, exposing its contents, and dividing the stricture, vheic’sei it is situated,/row ivitlwi; or it may be done by divid- ing the stricture outside, without opening the sac. In either case the great object of the operation, the di^dsion of the strictm-e by the knife, is the same ; but the mode in which it is effected is different. We shall first describe the ope- ration in which the sac is opened ; afterwards that in which it is not; and then briefly compare the two rig. C74.—operation for Hernia: Dirision of the Skin, procedures. OPERATlOJf IK WHICH THE Sac IS OPEKED.—Exposure of the Sac.—The patient having been brought to the edge of the bed, or placed on a table of convenient height, the bladder is emptied, and the parts that are the seat of operation are shaved. The dissection of the hernial coverings in layers anatomically ar- ranged, is never done at an operation. The Surgeon dissects, or rather cuts, down to the sac, then turns aside the coverings as a whole, and divides the stricture. He proceeds as fol- lows : An incision of sufficient length is made over the neck of the sac ; this may be best done by pinching up a fold of skin, pushing the scalpel through its base with the back of the instrument turned towards the hernia, and then cutting upwards (Fig. G74). A linear incision is thus made, which may be extended at either end if necessary ; the dissection is then can-ied through the \ superficial fascia and fat with the scalpel and forceps. ^ If any small artery spout freely, it had better be tied at oncc„ lest the bleeding obstruct the view of the part in the subsequent steps of the operation. As the Surgeon approaches the sac, more caution is required, particularly if the subserous areolar tissue be dense, opaque, and laminated. The Surgeon must pinch this up with the forceps, make a small incision into it, introduce a director, and lay it open upon this, or on the finger (Fig. G75).HERNIA. 636 If It be thin and not opaque, so as to admit a view of the subjacent parts be may dissect it through with the unsupported hand. In this way he proceeds until the sac is reached, which is usually knomi by its rounded and tense iippearance, its filamentous character, and by the arborescent an-angement of vessels upon its surface. In some cases the Surgeon thinks that he has Tcached the sac, when in reality he has only come upon a deep layer of con- densed aieolar tissue in close contact with it; here the absence of all appear- ance of vessels, the dull and opaque character of the tissue and its more solid feel, together with the absence of the peculiar tension that is characteristic of the sac, will enable him to recognise the real state of things. In other cases, it may happen that the sac is so thin, and the superficial structures are so little ■condensed, that the Surgeon lays it open in the earlier incisions before he thinks he has reached it. In these circumstances a portion of the intestine protruding might be mistaken for the sac. This dangerous eiTor may be avoided by observing the peculiarly smooth and highly polished appearance presented by the dark and congested gut, the absence of arborescent vessels, and the non-existence of any adhesions between its deeper portions and the tissues upon which it lies. If the sac be prematurely opened, the escape of fluid will indicate this ; and if omentum protrude, the granular appearance and peculiar feel of this tissue will at once cause its recognition. Opening the Sac.—The sac, having been exposed, must be carefully epened ; this should be done towards its anterior aspect; and, if it be a small ■one, at its lower pai’t. It may best be done, if the sac be not very tense, by seizing a portion of it between the finger and thmnb, and thus feeling that no intestine is included; a small portion of it is then pinched up by the forceps, and an opening is made into it by entting upon their points with the edge of the scalpel laid horizontally. If the sac be very tense, it cannot be pinched up in this way, and then it may best be opened by introducing the point of a fine hook very cautiously into its substance, raising up a portion of it in this way, and then making an apertiu-e into it. There is little risk of w'ounding the gut in doing this ; for, as the tension of the sac arises from the effusion of fluid into it, a layer of this will be interposed between it and the gut. In these cases, the fluid sometimes squirts out in a full jet, and occasionally exists in a very con- siderable quantity. I have seen at least a pint of slightly bloody serum escape •on opening the sac of an old strangulated inguinal hernia. Most frequently, however, there is not more than from half an ounce to an ounce ; and some- times the quantity is considerably less than this. Sir James Paget very visely attaches great importance to the character and appearance of the fluid in a hernial sac ; if this fluid be clear and transparent, of a yellow tint like serum, it is a good sign, as probably no great amount of congestion has taken place. If reddened by extravasation of blood, it is an evidence of increased congestion; and the deeper the discoloration, the browner, the more muddy the fluid, the greater probably has been the change induced in the strangled parts by the , congestion or inflammation resulting from the stricture. In some instances scarcely any fluid exists ; and then it becomes necessary to proceed with extreme caution in opening the sac, as the gut or omentum is applied closely to its imier wall. In such cases as these the sac is not unfrequently sufficiently translucent to enable the Surgeon to see its contents through it: and heDIVISION OF THE STRICTURE. 637 should then open it opposite to the oinentnm, or to any small mass of fat which he may observe shining through it. The opening having once been made into the sac, may be extended by the introduction of a broad director (Fig. G70), upon which it is to be slit up to a sufficient extent to allow the- examination of its contents. Fig. «V6.—Broail anti narrow Director on which tlio Sac may he divided. 3>’ Division of the Stricture.—The next point in the operation is the division of the strictiu-e ; and this requires considerable care, lest injury be done to the- neighbouring parts of importance, or the gut be wounded. Vessels and structures in the vicinity of the strictme are avoided by dividing it in a proper direction, in accordance with ordinary anatomical considerations, which will be. described when we come to speah of the special forms of ruptine. All injury to the intestine is prevented by introducing the index finger of the left hand, up to the seat of stricture, insinuating the finger-nail underneath it, and divid- ing the constriction by means of a hernia-knife, having a very limited cutting edge (Fig. 677). If a director be used to guide the knife, the intestine wiU be in considerable danger, as the instrument may be slid uuder that portion of it which hes beneath the stricture ; or the tense gut, curling over the side of the groove, may come into contact with the edge of the knife. These accidents are prevented by using the finger as a dhector, and slipping the hernia-knife (which should not have quite so long a probe - point as those usually made) along the pahnar surface of the finger, upon its flat side, (as represented in Fig. 678): the finger serves to keep the bowel out of the way, and detects any part that may be interposed between the edge of the knife and the stricture. During the division of the stricture, the protruding portions of intestine must be protected from injury by the knife. The operator may siwead his left hand over them in such a w'ay that they caimot be touched by the- edge of the instrument: or they may be protected by an attentive and careful assistant. In some cases the stricture is so tight that it is at first ahirost impossible- to get the edge of the nail underneatli it. The Surgeon, will, however, gene- rally succeed in doing so, by directing his assistant to draw down the cSl of Fig. 078.—Mode of u.sing tlie Hernia knife.HEllNIA. 638 intestine, so as to loosen it, as it were, from unclcrneath the stricture ; he will then usually succeed in passing his finger up in the middle of the coil, where the mesentery lies. So soon as the blunt end of the hernia-knife has been passed under the stricture, its sharp edge must be turned up, and the constric- tion divided in a piopcr dii’cction, to a very limited extent, from the one- •eighth to the quarter of an inch. Reduction, ihe intestine and omentum, having been examined, must be ■dealt with according to the condition in which they are found; as will be described at pp. 040—C45, Vol. II. If these structures be sufficiently healthy to admit of reduction, the intestine should first of all be replaced. This must be done by pushing it back with as much gentleness as possible, and chiefly by using the index-fingers. When it has slipped up into the abdomen, the omentum must be returned in the same way. In reducing the hernial protrusion, after the sac has been laid open, care should be taken that the mai-gins of this are firmly held doum by means of a pair of forceps ; lest it, together with its contents, be ’returned en masse, the strictime being undivided. After reduction, the Surgeon ■should pass his finger up into the canal through which the hernia has descended, and feel that all is clear. A suture or two should next be applied through the lips of the wound, with a few cross strips of plaster between them, ^ pad of lint laid over it, and a spica bandage to retain it all in proper position, and to prevent the protrusion of the hernia again during a fit of -coughing or a muscular effort. I have, however, seen the pressm*e of the pad occasion so much venous hmmoiThage, by producing congestion of the venous tissues in the neighbom-hood of the wound, as to require it to be laid aside, and the wound to be simply dressed. About the third or fourth day the sutures may be removed, and water-dressing applied. If inflammation or suppu- ration should set in, the part must be well poulticed; and care should be taken to leave the most dependent apertm-e free, as otherwise the pus formed in the external incisions may flow back through the internal apertm-e into the peritoneal cavity, and occasion fatal inflammation. Indeed, I think it desir- able that union of the lips of the wound after the operation for hernia should not take place by the first intention ; as it not unfr-equently happens when this ocem'S, that the pus and other discharges, not finding a ready outlet, may either be diffused between the muscular planes of the abdominal wall, occasioning sloughing and abscess, or, returning into the peritoneal cavity, may excite inflammation of it—a result which I have more than once seen occm-. The result of the operation for strangulated hernia is greatly influenced by the age of the patient; the result being very much more favourable in the carher than in the later periods of life. Of 15 consecutive cases operated on at Univei-sity College Hospital, of which 8 recovered and 7 died, the average age of the fatal cases was 23 years greater than that of the successful ones. Obesity, also, has a very unfavourable effect. The depth of the wound in fat people leads to an accumulation of drainage and exudative fluid from its loosely organised fatty walls, which decomposes readily, and soaking into the sub- peritoneal cellular tissue, gives rise to low and diffuse cellulitis with slougliing. After-Treatment.—The patient should be kept quiet in bed; a efry hot flannel laid over the abdomen, the leg on the affected side bent over a pillow.rElUTOXlTIS AFTER OPERATION. 639 and from ;5() to 40 m of laudammi given. The loowels will probably act ni the course of twenty-four hours ; should they not do so, a castor-oil and. gruel enema may be thrown up. It is of veiy great importance not to administer any purgatives in these cases, and to take little heed of the bowels not acting, even for three or four days after the operation. If the mechanical obstacles have been removed they will be sure to recover their proper action ; though, in consequence of the gut having been severely constricted and almost wounded by the pressiu-e of the stricture, it may require to be left quiet for a few days 1! before it can recover its peristaltic action. The administration of purgatives, I by still further irritating it, will increase the risk of inflammation in it, and { will probably do much harm. The patient, of course, must be kept upon the k simplest and most iiiiiiTitating diet—indeed, he should only be allowed barley- water and ice for the first day or two, and afterwards some beef-tea ; but no solid food must be given till the bowels have acted, and all risk of peritonitis has passed. Accidexts axp ]\Iodificatioxs of the Operatiox.—The operation ha\*ing been thus described, we have next to consider in detail certain accidents •attending it, or modifications which may be required ; such as Peritonitis, the , Management of the Intestine according to its conditions, the Management of Adhesions and of the Omentmn, Wounds of the Intestine and of Arteries, Sloughing of the Sac, Artificial Anus, and Pa3cal Fistula. Peritonitis after Operation.—The gxeat danger to be apprehended after ■operations for hernia is the supervention of perifo?iitis. This may have existed before the operation, may be impending at the time, or it may be occasioned, or at aU events gi’eatly increased, by the necessary wound of the peritoneirm. Two distinct kinds of peritonitis commonly follow operations for hernia ; the active or acute, and the passive or latent. Acute Peritonitis is commonly met with in strong and robust people, other- A\ise healthy, who are the subjects of the operation. It presents the ordinary symptoms of acute idiopathic inflammation of the abdomen ; there is tender- ness of a diffused character, with lancinating pains. The patient lies on his back, Avith his knees drawn up, has an anxious countenance, a quick, hard pulse, a diy tongue, and much inflammatory fever ; the respiration is prin- ■cipally thoracic, and tympanites soon comes on. The bowels are usually con- stipated, though sometimes irritated. The Treatment of this form of herniary peiitonitis is best conducted by the administration of opium, either alone or in combination Avith calomel. A pill containing gr. j of opium may be gWen every fourth or sixth hour. If the patient is young and strong, gr. j of calomel should bo added, and leeches, followed by hot fomentations, applied to the abdomen, and the patient confined to barley-Avater, milk, and ice. MTien the in- flammatory action is subdued, the constipation which is occasioned by it Avill be relieved Avithout the necessity of administering any purgatives. The tympanites may best be removed by tui’pentine enemata, and any lurking tenderness by the application of blisters. Latent or Passive Peritonitis appears to be of a diffused or erysipelatous character. It chiefly occurs in old people, or in Aveakly subjects, and is especially apt to folloAv upon inflammation of the omentum and its consequent :suppuration ; or it may occur in consequence of the extension of diseasedHERNIA. 640 actiou fi'om the cutaneous wound,, and in other cases from the morbid condi- tion induced by the strangulated gut. In hospital patients especially, in whom all disease is apt to assume a low character, this inflammation is peculiarly liable to occur. lu some instances, it sets in without the appearance of any marked local symptoms of inflammation, such as pain or uneasiness in the abdomen ; but, two or three days after the operation, the patient becomes depressed, with a quick and weak pulse, an anxious countenance, a tumid and tympsmitic abdomen, and rapid sinking of strength. In the majority of cases, however, some of the ordinary local signs of peritonitis are present. After death, the abdominal cavity will be found to contain a quantity of turbid serous fluid mixed mth flakes of lymph ; in many instances in such quantity as to give it a purifoim appearance, and not unfrequently matting together the coils of intestine. In the Treatment, it is necessary to support the patient, and in some instances even to administer stimulants, such as ammonia, the' brandy-and-egg mixture, &c. Depleting measures of aU kinds are quite inad- missible : and, indeed, the remedy that offers the most prospect of benefit ta the patient is opium, in full doses, one grain being given every third or fourth hour until some effect is produced upon the constitution. Opimn not only acts as an useful stimulant in these cases, but has a tendency to allay the increased vascular action. At the same time, a blister to the abdomen, dressed with mercurial ointment, may be advantageously employed ; and tiu-pentine enemata may be administered, with the view of removing the tympanites, which is a soiu’ce of much distress to the patient. Management of Congested Intestine.—The condition in Avhich th& contents of the sac are found in a case of hernia, determines greatly the coiu-se which the Singeon should pursue after the division of the stricture. Most frequently the intestine is deeply congested, being of a reddish pm-ple, a claret,, or chocolate colour. This congested state must not be confounded with gan- grene of the part—a mistake which might happen if the Surgeon were tO’ content himself with judging of its condition by the colour. However dark this may be, the gut cannot be said to be gangrenous so long as it is; polished and firm, free from putrescent odour, and without a greenish tinge. In cases in which there is much doubt as to whether its vitality continues or not, it has been proposed to scarify its surface lightly with the point of a lancet. If blood flow from the punctures, this may be taken as a proof of the continuance of the vitality of the part. Such a procedure as this, however, is certainly attended by some degree of danger, and can seldom be required. When the intestine is merely congested, however deeply this may be, the rule is, that it should be returned into the cavity of the abdomen in the hope of its ultimately recovering itself. This it wiU generally do if it have not been too much handled after the sac has been opened ; but in some cases it will slouc^h a few days after it has been reduced, and, the feces being discharged through the wound, a fecal fistula ^viU be formed; this may happen as late as the eighth or tenth day after the operation. Management of Tightly Constricted Intestine.—men the intestine has been very tightly nipped by a sharp-edged stricture, so that a deep sulcus or depression is left upon it, it seldom recovers itself, uhethci t c u 10 c 0VOL, II. Pig. G79.—Gangrene of Intestine from Strangulation. MANAGEMENT OF GAN'GliENOUS INTESTINE. 641 coil of <Tut have been thus affected, or the constriction have been limited to a small portion of the diameter of the intestine. It is ^ quickly changes which are incompatible with life may ensue in a poition of gut that has been very tightly strangulated. I have knotvn a coil of intestine, tl at had been but eight hours strangidated before the operation Avas performed, so tightly constricted as not to regain its vitality after reduction (Fig. G7i)). In such cases the patient usually dies of peritonitis in the course of a feAV days, Avithout the boAvels having acted, all peristaltic motion having necessarily been annihilated at the injured point. .On examination after death, the con- stricted intestine Avill be found to pre- sent all the appearances of^«n(/rene,being of a black or ashy-grey colour, Avithout having any flocculi of lymph deposited upon its surface, though these may be in abundance in the neighbouring parts. From the veiy unfavourable result of those cases in Avhich there has been very tight nipping of the protruded boAvel, a veiy cautious progmosis should be given; and, in reducing the gut after the diAusion of the stric- ture, care should be taken not to push it far back into the abdomen, but to leave it near the inner ring ; so that, in the event 01 its ultimately gmng Avay, there may be less risk of feculent extravasation. In those cases in Avhich the nipping has been very severe, the sulcus being distinctly marked, and the intestine excessively dark and congested, though not actually gan- grenous, it Avould, I think, be better, after dividing the stricture, to leave the gut outside the ring than to return it; the reduction of intestine in this state being almost invariably foUoAved by fatal peritonitis. It is important to observe that although intestine, AA'hich has been so severely nipped as this, may not be able to recover its vitahty, and Avill fall into a state of gangvene after being reduced, yet if does not, at the time of its exposure, present the characters of putrescence ; there is no fetor, no green or pulpy appearance, no loss of polish, nor separation of peritoneum ; it is simply of a dark purple or morone colour, and that it has been tightly nipped is eA’ident from the sidcus upon it. There are no signs of gangrene, simply because sufficient time has not elapsed for putrefaction to set in. As, AA hen a pile or naevus has been tied, though vitality be extinct in the part, Avhich is swollen and purple, some time must elapse before signs of putrescence manifest themsehns, so it may bo Avith a strictured gut Avhich may have lost its vitality ; and it should be treated as mortified intestine, though there be no sign of putridity about it. Management of Gangrenous Intestine.—When the intestine is actually gangrenous, the integuments covering the tumour aauII be infiltrated, braAvny and duskily congested, and the structures immediately overlyino- the sac matted together ; the sac will contain fetid dark-colomcd serum or“pus ; and T THERNIA. 642 the softened, laccrahlo, or pulpy look of the protruded part, its loss of lustre, and peculiar greenish-black or dark-grey colour, will cause the nature of the mischief to be readily recognised. In the majority of cases there will be much constitutional depression, and clammy skin, tympanitic abdomen, and browi or black tongue ; but in some instances I have known all these symptoms to be absent, and the condition of the patient to present no very unfavourable state. Some difference of opinion exists as to the proper line of practice to be adopted in such cases. Travers and Lawence seem to think that the division of the stricture is unnecessary, or may even be injurious ; whilst Dupuytren, A. Cooper, and Key (with whom I concur), advise that it should be done : that the stricture should be divided in the usual way ; that a free incision should then be made into the protruded portion of bowel, which must be left unre- duced, so as to allow the escape of faeces ; and the wound left open and covered by a poidtice. In this way an artificial anus will necessarily be formed, through which the feculent matter finds exit. The gut in the vicinity of the strictoe is retained in situ by masses of plastic matter, which prevent the peritoneal cavity from being opened. If the intestine should already have given way before the operation is performed, the stricture must be divided, and the part then left imreduced, care being taken to interfere as little as possible with any adhesions or connections lying inside the neck of the sac ; though I fully agree with Key, in thinking that the danger of disturbing them has been exaggerated. When a small portion of the bowel only is gangrenous, the better plan is to return it just beyond the mouth of the sac, without laying it open ; but it should not be pushed any distance into the cavity of the abdomen ; the pres- sure of the surrounding parts wiU prevent extravasation. When the slough separates, it will probably be discharged into the cavity of the intestine ; and the aperture resulting will be closed by the adhesions that extend between its margin and the abdominal wall. Ullanageiueiit of Adhesions.—This varies according to the condition of the bowel, and the nature and situation of the bands. As has just been remarked, if gangrene be present, especial care must be taken not to distimb any connections that have been formed about the neck of the sac, and which constitute the most effectual barrier against feculent extravasation. When the adhesions are recent, consisting merely of plastic matter, in whatever situation they exist, they may readily be broken down with the finger or the handle of the scalpel, and the parts then returned. When of old standing, and dense, they must be dealt with according to then connections. Most frequently these adhesions occur in the shape of thickened bands, situated -within and stretclnug across the neck of the sac. In other cases, they may be found either as fila- mentous bands, or as broad attachments connecting the sac with its conten s, and perhaps tying these together. When of a narrow and constricted form, and more pai'ticularly when seated in the neck of the sac, or stretching 1 *e bridles across its interior, they may readily be divided by a probe-poin e bistoury, or the hernia-knife. If they consist of broad attachments, tli y may be dissected away, by a little cai-eful manipulation, froin the paits in the inside of the sac; though, if the adhesions extensive mi old standing, it may sometimes be more prudent to dissect away ^ 1T T 2 MANAGEMENT OF OMENTUM. 642 tion of the sac which is in connection with them, or even to leave them nntouchccl, and the adherent intestine or omentum nnreduced rather than to endeavour to separate them. They may, however, attach themselves m such situations that it becomes necessary to divide them ; thus I have, in a case of congenital hernia, found it necessary to dissect away some very extensive and widely spread adhesions that had formed between the omentum and the testicle, and indeed had almost completely enveloped that organ. Internal Adhesions between the omentum and intestine or mesentery occa- sionally exist, consisting usually of rather firm bands stretching across from one pai't to the other, sometimes connected with the inner wall of the sac, but in other cases confined to its contents. As these bands may constitute the real strictime, continuing to strangulate the gut after the division of the structures outside and in the neck of the sac, they must necessarily be divided. This operation requires great care, lest the neighboming intestine be wounded. It is best done by passing a director underneath, and cutting the bands through with a probe-pointed bistoury ; or if this cannot be done on account of their connections, they must be seized with forceps, and carefuUy dissected off the gut. In a case of large inguinal hernia, containing both gut and omentum, on which I operated some years ago, I found, after dividing the stricture, and taking hold of the omentum in order to push back the intestine, that this could not be reduced. On searching for the cause of difl&culty, and drawing the mass well down, I found high up, in the part corresponding to the neck of the sac, a narrow band. Like a piece of whipcord, stretching across fi’om the omentum to the mesenteiy and firmly tying down the gut. On dissecting this earefuUy through, the constricted portion of intestine subjacent to it sprang up to its full diameter, aU constriction being removed, and was then very readily reduced. Management of Omentum.—The omentum may require to be treated in one of three ways : 1. It may be retinned ; 2. It may be left in the sac ; 3. It may be cut off. The method of treatment must vary according to the state in which the omentum is found. If it be small in quantity, healthy in character though congested, and apparently recently protruded, not having undergone those changes that occur in it when it has been a long time in a hernial sac, it should be reduced after the intestine has been put back. If, however, its mass be very large, if it be hypertrophied, indiuated, or otherwise altered in structure, or if it be closely adherent to the sac, at the same time that it is congested. Surgeons are agreed that it should not be returned into the abdominal cavity ; as inflammation of it, E^iploitis, will pio la y set in and terminate fatally -with effusion into the peritoneal sac. So a so, 1 e omentum be in large quantity, and have become inflamed in the sac. It should not be returned ; as the inflammation in it is very apt to run on ° condition of the whole mass. If gangrenous, it should sac bu/vltho hypertrophied and adherent to the sac, but without evidence of inflammation, it may be left in the sac • but in many of the cases of hypertrophied, and in all cases of inflamed or ganorenous omentum, the best practice consists in cutting off the mass, as rccLmended644 HERNIA. by Sir A. Cooper and Tia^n’cncc. If it be left iu the sac, inflammation or sloiigbing of it will occur, and the patient can derive no corresponding advan- tage to the danger he will consequently nm. Excision of the mass may be done in two ways, either by seizing and cutting it off at a level with the external ring, or by first inclosing the neck of the mass in a small whipcord ligature, and then cutting it off below this. If the first method be employed, the arteries of the stump, which are sometimes rather numerous, are apt to bleed freely : they must be tied singly by fine hgatures, Avhich should be left hanging out of the wound. There is often, however, a tendency to the retrac- tion of the stump of the omentum into the abdominal cavity ; in which case '• the ligatures, dropping into the peritoneum, and acting as setons, may become sources of gxeat initation : in order to prevent this, the better plan is to knot them together, and to fix their ends by a piece of plaster upon the forepart of the abdomen. The second plan consists in draw’ng down the mass of omen- tiun, passing a strong double whipcord ligature through its neck, tying this i securely on each side, and then cutting off the whole of the mass below the ligature. I have for many years employed it with excellent effect, and indeed noAV generally prefer it to the method just described, over which it possesses the advantages of freedom from hEemorrhage and impossibility of deep retrac- tion of the cut edge of the omentum into the cavity of the abdomen, provided moderate traction be kept up in the ligatures. The constricted stump of omentum sloughs away in a few days, and separates with the hgature. When | this practice is adopted, the wound should not be closed, but must be lightly poulticed. Should it be prefeiTed to do this operation antiseptically, the omentum may be tied with catgut ligatures cut short, a drainage-tube intro- duced, and the usual antiseptic dressings applied. The quantity of omentum that is cut off varies considerably ; the mass removed usually weighs from four to six ounces, but in some instances it may amount to a pound or more. Sacs or Ajoerhires are occasionally foimied in the omentum, in which a knuckle of intestine may become enveloped, or by the mai’gins of which it may be strangulated. These envelopes of omentum around the gut, which have been especially described by P. Hewett, may occur in aU kinds of hernia, at least in the inguinal, the femoral, and the umbilical, and sometimes acquire a large size, completely shutting in the gut. They appear to be formed in some cases at least by the adhesion of the opposite edges of floating layem of omentum aroimd a piece of intestine, which thus becomes mcluded. It is of importance to bear in mind the possibility of their existence, and in aU cases to unravel the omentum before removing it, lest it contain a knuckle of intes- tine, Avhich might be wounded in the operation. Cysts, usually containing pellucid serous fluid, straAV-colom’ed or reddened, though sometimes they are filled with blood, are occasionally met with m the omentum. They appear to be formed in the same Avay as the sacs containing intestine just described, except that they are inclosed on all sides, their serous contents being merely exudations Irom the peritoneal lining of t e cys . They are globular, elastic, and closely resemble in form a knuckle of intestine, occasioning not a little embaiTassment to the Surgeon : by a caieful examina tion and unravelling, however, of the omentum, their true nature will be madeWOUND OF ARTERIES IN OPERATION. 645 out; their fluid contents may then be discharged, and the omentum dealt with according to the rules already given. _ ^ Wounds of the Intestine may accidentaUy occur at two periods of the oneration • either from the Surgeon cutting too freely doum upon the sac, and onenhm this before he is aware of what he is about; or else, at the time of the di\dsion of the stricture, from a portion of the gut which lies beneath it ^rettino- into the way of the edge of the knife, and being nicked by it. The flrst Idnd of accident can only happen from a certain degree of carelessness ; but it is not always so easy to avoid woimding the gut, when the stricture is so tio-ht that the finger-nail cannot be slipped under it as a guide to the hernia- knife. In cases of this kind, a very narrow director must be used ; and this is a most dangerous instrument, as, in passing it deeply out of sight under the tight stricture, a small portion of the gut may ciml up over its side into the gi’oove, and thus become notched by the knife as this is slid along it. This accident has happened to the best and most careful Simgeons. Lawrence relates two cases that occm’red to him ; and Sir A. Cooper, Cloquet, Jobert, and Liston have all met with it. It may be known to have occurred by the bubbling up of a small quantity of flatus and liquid faeces from the bottom of the inciSon. The Treatment of a wound of the gut must depend upon its size. When it is very small, rather resembhng a puncture than a cut, the practice recommended by Sir A. Cooper should be adopted ; viz., to seize the margins of the incision with a pair of forceps, and to tie a fine silk thread tightly round them, the ends of which should then be cut off, and the gut returned into the abdominal cavity. Such a proceeding as this does not appear to give rise to much, if to any, increase of danger. In a case that occurred to me many years ago at the Hospital, in which, owing to the excessive tight- ness of the strictiu’e, a very naiTow director only could be passed under it, the gut immediately above it was notched and opened by a kind of punctured wound ; this was tied up in the way mentioned, and after the death of the patient) which took place on the fourth day after the operation from gangrene of the strangulated portion of bowel, the silk hgature was found to be com- pletely enveloped in a plug of plastic matter. If the wound be of larger size, it must be closed by the glovers’ stitch. Wound of one of the Arteries in the neighbourhood of the sac may occm- dining the division of the strictui-e, either in consequence of some anomaly in the distribution of the vessel, or from the Surgeon dividing the parts in a ivrong direction. This accident usually happens to the epigastric or to the obturator artery ; and Lawrence has collected fointeen recorded cases in which it occurred. The result in these has been very various ; in some the patients have died ; in others, after much loss of blood, and conse- quent faintness, the bleeding ceased spontaneously. The proper Treatment Avould certainly consist in cutting down upon and securing the bleeding vessel. In the event of the Surgeon operating on a case of hernia, without having- been able previously to satisfy himself as to its precise character, or if from any cause, in dividing the strictiue, he have reason to dread the proximity of an arteiy, he may safely and readily divide the constriction with a knife that would not easily cut an artery ; and he will And, if he blunt the edge of his hernia-knife by draiving it over the back of the scalpel, that it will still be646 HERNIA. keen enough to relieve the strangulation, whilst it will push before it any artery that may happen to be in the way. ^ Sloughing of the Sac is of rare occun’ence, and, when it happens, is commonly attended by fatal results ; it is not, however, necessarily so. It has tv ice happened in my piactice ; and in both cases the patient recovered. In an old woman on whom I operated for femoral hernia of very laro-e size the sac sloughed away, exposing nearly the whole of Scarpa’s triangle Avith almost as much distinctness as if it had been dissected ; but, although in much danger for a time from an acute attack of peritonitis, she ultimately recovered. Artificial Anus and Faecal Fistula.—When an apertme exists in the bowel by which the Avhole of the intestinal contents escape externally, the condition is denominated an arMficial amis. When but a small portion so escapes, the greater part finding its way through the natural anus, a fcecal fistula is said to exist. The quantity of feculent discharge necessarily depends upon the extent of destruction of the intestinal coats; and its character on the part of the gut that is injured. The escape takes place involuntarily, and is usually continuous. This condition may occur in several ways. Thus the gut may be acci- dentally wounded during the operation, and the fteces may afterwards continue to be discharged through the aperture so made ; or it may have been gan- gvenous, and have given way into the sac before the operation; or the Surgeon may have intentionally laid open a gangrenous portion of intestine, so as to facilitate the escape of the faeces. In some cases in which the bowel has been severely nipped, and is dark and congested, though it have not actually fallen into a state of gangrene, it may not be able to recover itself after its return into the abdominal cavity, but will give way m the course of three, four, six, or even ten days after the operation. In these cases, a small quantity of fecu- lent matter is first observed in the dressings; and gradually a greater discharge appears, until at last the fistulous opening is completely estabhshed. In such cases, it is of importance to observe that, although the bowel gives Avay within the peritoneal cavity, the fteces do not become extravasated mto this,, but escape externally. This important circumstance is owing to the fact of the portion of the bowel that is nipped losing its peristaltic action, and consequently remaining where it is put back ; the parts in the neighbourhood inflaming, throAving out lymph, and becoming consolidated to each other and to the parietal peritoneum, so as to include the gangrenous portion of the gut, and completely to circumscribe it. It is consequently of great importance, in cases of this kind, not in any Avay to disturb the adhesions, that have formed between the sides of the aperture in the gut and the neck of the sac. The Pathology of Artificial Amis is commonly as follows. The edges of the- apertiu'e in the gut are glued by plastic matter to the abdominal wall; and 1 A\^hether the whole or a portion only of the cahbre of the intestine be destroyed, the apertures of the upper and lower end, though at first lying almost in a continuous line, soon unite at a more or less acute angle. These are at first similar in size, and present no material differences in shape or appearance : as the disease becomes more chronic, they gradually alter in their characters ; the647 TREATMENT OF FjEGAL FISTULA. i-ture, being no longer used for the transmission of feces, ^adually tciidcncyto act as a kind of valve, and thus to occlude the orifice into the lower portion of the gut. The integuments in the neighbourhood of such an aperture as this usually become initatcd, infiamed, and excoriated, from the constant passage of the feces over them. In some cases, the mucous membrane fining the edges becomes everted, and pouting; and, in others, a true prolapse takes place, large portions of the membrane protruding. An artificial anus fully formed in this way never undergoes spontaneous cure. Besides this, which is the ordinaiy form of artificial anus, we must, I think, recognise at least two other varieties, both of which I have met in prac- tice. In one of these, the angle formed by the gut is adherent to the upper extremity of the sac which has been returned, and thus lies at some distance from the sm’face, so that the fecal matter traverses a long canal before it reaches the external aperture. In the other variety the angle of the gut is fixed at a higher point within the abdomen, and the feces find their way out through a channel bounded by agglutinated coils of intestine and layers of lymph. In both of these forms, there is a considerable distance between the external opening and the apertm’e in the gut. Thus, then, there are three forms of artificial anus, differing from one another according to the situation of the angle of the gut in relation to the external opening and to its connections. I^Tien a Fenced Fistula has formed, the condition of parts is somewhat dif- ferent. The apertiue in the intestine consists of merely a small perforation in its coats, unattended by any considerable loss of substance, through which a quantity of thin fiuid and feculent matter exudes, giving rise to a good deal of irritation of neighbouring structures. In some cases, there are several apertures communicating with the gut, and extending through the skin. Fistulous openings of this kind not unfrequently undergo spontaneous cure after existing for a few weeks or months. TfeedmcnL—\i the aperture be merely a small one, with a naiTOw fistula leading into the gut, the chief inconvenience suffered by the patient often arises from the inltation of the skin around the opening by the continued moistme of the feculent matter. In such cases the skin should be protected by means of zinc ointment, spread on lint; and the patient should wear a pad to restrain the discharge. By the pressure of this pad the aperture may sometimes be made to close. In other cases, the occasional application of the galvanic cautery or of a red-hot wire will induce contraction of its edges ; and in other instances, again, a plastic operation of some kind may be required. But I confess I have not usually seen much advantage result from such operations, which are often followed by erysipelas. As the existence of an artificial anus', by interfering with nutrition, commonly gives rise to considerable emaciation,'HERNIA. 648 it becomes necessary to support tbe patient’s strength by a sufficient quantity of good and nourishing food ; this is of greater consequence the higher the fistula is, as the interference with the earlier stages of the digestive process, and the loss of nutritive material by the discharge of the chyme, is propor- tionally gTeat. Spontaneous cure will occasionally take place, even though a perfect artificial anus exist. In a case under my care at the Hospital, a whole knuckle of intestine was gangTenous, and sloughed away, leaHng an artificial anus, which discharged the greater part of the intestinal contents, hut gradually contracted and closed without any local application or treatment beyond attention to cleanliness. If the aperture become a permanent artificial anus, surgical means must, if possible, be adopted in order to effect a cure. In accomplishing this, two important indications have to be fulfilled: the first is to diminish or destroy the projecting valvular or spur-like process, and thus to re-establish the continuity of the canal; and, after this has been done, the external wound may be closed, by paring its edges, and bringing them together with hare-bp pins. The first object is best accompbshed by Dupuytren’s enterotome (Fig. 680); this consists of an instrument something like a pair of scissors, mth blunt but serrated blades, which may be brought together by acting upon a screw that traverses its handle. One blade of the instrument (a) is passed into the upper, the other (&) into the lower portion of the intestine ; they are then approxi- mated slowly, and fixed by means of the screw in such a way as to compress on each side the spur-like process (Fig. 681). Veiy gradually, day by day, this screw is tightened so as to induce sloughing of this projection, and cohesion 01 its serous surfaces. As this action goes on, the initation caused by the instru ment wiU occasion plastic matter to be thrown out in the angle foimed by t e intestine, so that the peritoneum and mesentery become consobdated, and ail opening into the peritoneal cavity is avoided. Should the spur-hke process e accidentaby cut through before the lymph is thrown out in sufficient quaiitity, the peritoneum would be opened, and death would probably ensue, len the necessity for caution in this procedme. So soon as the bla es 0 Fig. 6SO.—Dupuj'trens Enterotome.

In some cases, from the length of time that has elapsed—many years, possibly —the fistula continues permanently patent, and no treatment is available for its closure. Its existenee is not incompatible with good general health. I have had two cases under my constant observation, in one of which, that of a woman about fifty years of age, the whole of the intestinal contents have been discharged for four years through an aperture of the umbilicus, in consequence of the sloughing away of a large coil of intestine in an umbilical hernia ; and another case is a lady more than eighty, who has for upwards of thirty ycai-s had a fiecal fistula in the right groin, consequent on an operation for femoral hernia. OrERATiON 'WITHOUT OPENING THE Sac.—The possibility of removing the stricture in strangulated hernia without laying the sac open, naturally sug- gested itself when it was known that in many cases the stricture was seated in the tendinous and areolar tissues outside the neck of the sac, and that, when these were divided, the protrusion was readily reduced. This operation was performed by Petit as loug ago as 1718, but was seldom practised until it was revived of late years by Aston Key and Luke. The great advantage sought to be gained by this operation is that, as the peritoneum is not interfered 'with nor its ca'vity opened, the risk from peritonitis "will be proportionately lessened. The wound made by the operation being altogether superficial, and the sac not opened, its risk has been compared to that of the taxis, with the addition of that which would result from a superficial wound. This argument would be conclusive in favour of the operation without opening the sac, if it could be sho'mi that, in all cases of strangulated hernia, peritonitis is occasioned by interfering -with the peritoneal cavity ; it must, however, be admitted, even by the keenest advocates of Petit’s operation, that this is not the case. But there is this additional element of risk : that it is the taxis practised on a hernia that has been so tightly strangled that reduction is impossible without operation, and in which, consequently, the parts that constitute the hernial protrusion are infinitely more congested, inflamed, and deteriorated in struc- ture than are those in which reduction by the simple taxis wdthout opera- tion to di'vide the stricture is possible. In many instances the inflammation exists before any operation is performed, being evidently produced by the stricture of and consequent injmy to the gut. But it cannot with fairness be argued that, though the peritonitis may exist before the operation, the incision of the peritoneal cavity does not increase it; even in healthy persons, laying open the abdomen, handhng the gut and omentum, and pushing the fingers into the peritoneal sac, would always be followed by intense, often by fatal, peritonitis. It is only reasonable to believe that the same proce- dures in an already inflamed peritoneum would be followed by equally disastrous results. That the opening made into the cavity of the abdomen in reality adds to the frequency of the peritonitis, cannot, I think, be doubted by any Surgeon. It not unfrequently happens in strangulated hernia, that no sign of peritonealHERNIA. 650 inflammation sets in until one or two days after the operation is performed; and then it ocenrs evidently as the result of this procedure. That the fatality of the peritonitis, even if existing before any operation be practised, must be greatly increased by interference ivith the serous sac, is e’S'ident from the fact already mentioned, that death very rarely ocem’s (not more than once in many hundred cases) after the reduction of a strangulated hernia by the taxis. Fully admittino-, therefore, that in many cases the peritonitis exists before the operation, and is occasioned by causes independent of it; it is, I think, impossible to deny that the inflammation is frequently directly occasioned by opening the peritoneal cavity, and handling the viscera ; and that, when already existing, its fatality must be greatly increased by this procedme. In fact, there are two causes for peritonitis in cases of operated strangulated hernia—viz., the constriction of the strictm-e, and the wound of the peritoneum. That form of peritonitis which arises from the pressme of the strictme is equally liable to happen, whether Petit’s operation or that by opening the sac be practised, and often precedes the operation ; whilst the peritonitis which arises from wound of the serous membrane does not occm’ in Petit’s operation, but is necessarily confined to that in which the sac is opened. There are, however, two objections that may be mged against Petit’s opera- tion with more justice than that it does not tend to prevent the occmi’ence of peritonitis. The first is that, if the intestine be not seen, it may sometimes be retmned in a gangrenous condition ; and the second, that the gut may possibly be retiu’ned stiU strangled by bands of adhesion, or by inclusion in an omental aperture. With regard to the first objection, it may be stated that, if the intes- tine be in a gangrenous state, there wiU usually be some evidence of this, either in the change that has taken place in the general symptoms of the patient, or in the condition of the sac and its coverings, which will enable the Singeon to guess at the condition of the enclosed parts, and will of course induce him to expose them fully and examine them thoroughly. This objection, however, cannot apply to those cases in which the strangulation has only existed for a time that would be insufficient to allow the occurrence of gangrene, and does not therefore oppose the performance of Petit’s operation in recent cases of strangulation. With regard to the occiuTence of internal strangulation, it is excessively rare ; and when it does occm, it still more rarely happens, whether the strangulation be effected by bands of adhesion or by an apertme in the omentum, that the parts can be retmned without opening the sac, adhesions usually existing also between this structure and its contents. But the best answer to the objections against the operation without opening the sac, are the results that have followed this practice. Luke, who has had great experience on this subject, states that he has operated in 84 cases of hernia. In 25 of these the sac was opened; in 59 the sac remained unopened. Of the 25 in which it was opened, 8 died ; whilst, of the 59 in which Petit’s operation was performed, only 7 died. If to Luke’s cases we add those reported by N. Ward, we shall find 36 deaths in 153 cases of Petit’s operation. That the ordinai-y operation, indeed, of opening the sac, is an exceedingly fatal one, is well known to aU hospital Smgeons, and is folly proved by smgical statistics. Of 77 opera- tions for hernia, reported by Sir A. Cooper, 36 proved fatal; and of 545 cases, recorded in the Journals, and collected by Tmner, 260 are reported to haveOPERATION WITHOUT OPENING SAG. 651 died. The result, therefore, of Luke’s operations is most favom-able, ^Yhen contrasted with those in which the sac was opened. . The operation without opening the sac may be practised in all foms ot hernia, but is much more readily done in some varieties of the disease than in others. It is espeeially applicable in cases of femoral hernia, in which the stricture is commonly outside the sac, as will be mentioned when speaking of that form of the disease. Of 31 cases of femoral hernia, operated on by Luke,, the sac required to be opened in 7 only. In inguinal hernia it is not so easy to perform Petit’s operation ; indeed, in the majority of cases the Sm-geon wiU fail to remove the stricture in this way. This is owing to the constriction being usiiaUy seated in the neck of the sac, and is especially observable in con- o-eni°al hernia. Of 20 inguinal herniEe operated on by Luke, the sac required to be opened in 13 instances. _ _ . For the various reasons that have been mentioned, I am decidedly of opmioii that tills operation should always be attempted, in preference to the ordinary one of opening the sac, in those cases in which the hernia, not having been long- strangulated, presents no sign of the occm-rence of gangrene in it, and more especiaUy when it is femoral or umbilical. Even if the Surgeon fail in com- pleting Petit’s operation, in consequence of the incorporation of the strictiu'e in the neck of the sac, or the constriction of this part, no harm can have resulted for the sac, after being exposed, may at any time be opened in the ordinary way, and the operation completed by dividing the stricture from within. 'VlTieu the hernia is of large size and irreducible, it is of especial importance to avoid opening the sac. If it be opened, the contents will inflame, and fatal peritonitis commonly ensues. In these cases, as Luke has pointed out, it rai-ely happens that the old inherent parts are seriously strangulated, but the- whole mischief seems to be occasioned and to be received by the new protrusion, that has taken place, and that gives rise to the tension; and if this can be liberated and reduced, the Surgeon has done all that need be accomplished. The evidence of the reduction of the recent protrusion, although the old adherent and in-educible hernia be left, is usually sufficiently obvious ; the portion of gut returning -with a slip and a gingle, with considerable diminution in the general tension of the tumour. Operation.—With regard to the mode of performing Petit’s operation little' need be said here, as it is precisely identical with the steps of the other operation up to the period of the exposine of the sac; except that, when it is not intended to open this, the incisions should be can-ied more directly over its neck. The stricture, if situated outside the sac, will then be found either in some of the tendinous structures surrounding it, or else in the subserous areolar tissue lying upon it. After the division of the constricting bands in this situation, by means of a probe-pointed knife carried underneath them, or by dissecting down upon them, an attempt at the taxis may be made by compressing the tumour in the usual way, at the same time that its neck is steadied by the fingers of the left hand. If the contents can be reduced, the incision in the superficial structiu’cs is brought together by a few strips of plaster, over which a pad and bandage may be applied. Bhould peritonitis come on, as the result of the strangulation, it must be ti-eated in the usual way. If, after the Sm’geon has fairly divided all the structures outside the sac, he find still that the return of652 HERNIA. the hernia is prevented hj some constriction in its neck, it will be necessaiw to lay this open and divide the constriction in the usual way. Reduction in Mass.—The reduction of the hernia in mass consists in the return of the sac and its contents into the abdomen still in a state of strangu- lation. When it is said that the parts are returned into the abdomen, it must not be understood that they are pushed back into its cavity, but that the external protrusion is caused to disappear by being pushed into the subserous areolar tissue behind and underneath the parietal peritoneum, between it and the abdominal muscles. This remarkable accident, which was first described by the French Surgeons of the last centiuy, received but little notice from practitioners in this country until attention was drawm to it by Luke, by whom its pathology has been carefully studied. Birkett, who has also investigated this condition wdth much care, is of opinion that the' sac is not torn from its connections in the scrotum or canal, and pushed back, but that it is ruptured, usually at its posterior part at its neck, and that thus the contents of the sac ai-e forced through this rent into the subperitoneal areolar tissue ; whilst the month of the sac, stiU constricting the hernia, and thus keeping it in a state of strangulation, is pushed back from the internal ring. It appears to me that both explanations are correct, and that we must admit two forms of reduction in mass ; the sac being pushed back intact in a state of strangulation, in one form, as descilbed by Luke ,• whilst in the other, as observed by Birkett, the sac is ruptured, and the hernia, strangulated by the displaced mouth of the sac, is forced out through the rent. Causes.—The reduction in mass has been far more frequently observed in cases of inguinal than in those of any of the other varieties of hernia. It has been met with in femoral hernire, but very rarely, and, so far as I know, not in any other form of the disease. This comparative frequency of its occurrence in inguinal hernim is doubtless due to their large size, and loose areolar con- nections. The accident has more often occiured from the patient’s own efforts at reducing a strangulated hernia, than from those of the Simgeon. It is a remarkable fact that, in most of the instances in which it has ocemred, only a very shght degree of force appears to have been employed in the reduction of the tumoiu’; and the accident would seem to have resulted from the adhesions between the sac and the neighboming parts being much weaker than natmal, so that a moderate degree of force caused the whole to shp through the canal. It may, hoAvever, occm* from the Sm’geon’s efforts, if these be too forcible or long continued. Symptoms.—The symptoms indicative of this accident are constitutional and local. The constitutional symptoms consist in a continuance of those that are indicative of the existence of strangrdation, notwithstanding the disappear- ance of the tumour. The vomiting and constipation persisting, the patient speedily becomes much depressed in strength, being seized with hiccup and prostration of all vital power ; signs of gangrene then evince themselves Avithin the sac ; and death ensues. An examination of the parts in hernia will usually enable the Simgeon to recognise the nature of the accident; he will ascertain that a tumoiu’ had pre- viously existed, and Avill learn from a description of its general characters, and the symptoms occasioned by it, that it Avas in aU probability a strangulatedASPIRATION IN STRANGULATED HERNIA. 655 rupture. ITo 'will then find, on examining the part, that there is a total absence of all that fulness Avhich is occasioned by the presence of the sac, even after its contents only have been reduced ; the sac, in such cases, always giving rise to a feeling of fulness and roundness in the part. He will, on the contrary, find that the abdominal ring is peculiarly and very distinctly open ; it is much larf>-er than usual, and somewhat rounded. On pushing the finger into the canal, this will be felt quite empty; but in some cases, on deep pressure with the finger, cspeeially Avhen the patient stands up or coughs, a rounded tumour may be in- distinctly felt behind the ordinary seat of the hernia. In many cases, however,, the most careful manual examination will fail to detect any prominence of this kind. Treatmonl.—If, after careful examination of such a case as this, in w'hich the symptoms of strangulation continue, the Surgeon learn by the previous history that a tumour has existed, but that it has suddenly gone up; and further, if he find that the seat of the supposed hernia presents the negative evidence that has just been described, it will then be necessary for him to push his inquiries a step further by an exploratory incision. Such an incision as this may first be used as a simple means of diagnosis, and, as it does not penetrate the peritoneal cavity, there is no danger attending it; and if the hernia be found, it wiU serve the pm-pose of the ordinary incision required in the operation, and may be used for the relief of the strangulation. The fii’st incision should be made so as to expose the abdominal ring ; if this be found peculiarly round and open, it would increase the pi-obabihty of the existence of the condition sought for. The inguinal canal must next be laid open, and the parts contained within it care- fully examined. If no appearance of hernial sac be found, but the cord be distinctly and clearly seen, still further presumptive evidence wiU be afforded of the reduction having been effected in mass ; for, if the hernia have been put back in the usual way, the sac will necessarily be left in the canal, and will preserve its usual relations to the cord. This supposition will be strengthened almost to a certainty if it be found that the “ condensed cellular capsule imme- diately investing the sac, as it is termed by Luke—^in other words, the con- densed and laminated subserous areolar tissue—has been left in the canal. An opening made into this will, as that Siu’geon observes, allow the finger to be brought into contact with the hernial tumour itself. Should, however, this condensed areolar tissue not be found, it must not be concluded that no hernia is present, inasmuch as this investment may have been accidentally absent. The finger should then be passed into the internal ring, which will probably be found open, and should be carried from side to side ; the tumour, if present m\\ be deteeted lying externaUy to the peritoneum behind the abdominal wall! \V hen found, it must be brought down into the canal by enlarging the ring ; it must then be opened, its contents examined, and the stricture in its neck divided. The intestine that has been so strangled must be dealt with in accordance with the rules already laid dowm. If the tumour cannot be readily u examination of it and its contents, the patient desired to make some propulsive efforts, so as to cause it to protrude If not come do^vn, it must be opened, and the stricture cautiously diyided within the abdomen with a sheathed bistoury. Treatment of Strangulated Hernia by Aspiration.—This operation, in■654 HERNIA. Avliicli it is attempted to render a strangulated hernia i-educible by withdrawing its gaseous and fluid contents by means of the pneumatic aspirator, was introduced into practice by Dieulafoy, and is thus performed ;—An aspirator of the form represented in Fig. COO, page 571, is to be preferred, and the needle must not exceed inch in diameter. The aspirator having been proved to be in working order, and the needle clear, a vacuum is made by withdrawing the piston. A few drops of water may be left in the bottom of the piston, so that gas may bo recognised as soon as it enters. The needle is now introduced into that part of the tumour, where, from resonance on percussion, or elastic feel, the gut is supposed to lie, and as soon as its eye is covered the vacuum is turned on. The needle must now be carefully and steadily pushed onwards. If there be fluid in the sac this wiU rise into the syringe, and as soon as it ceases to flow, the needle must be again carefully pushed onwards, until, from the appearance of gas or faecal matter in the syringe, it is known that the gut is reached. The needle must be held steadily and pushed in one direction only, as any lateral movement would tend to scratch or tear, the gut. The gas may be sufficient in quantity to abolish the vacuum, and if this occur, the cock must be tinned, the syringe emptied, and a fr'esh vacuum made. If one punctiue fails to diminish the bulk of the tumour, the needle must be with- draiim and inserted at a fresh spot, and this may be repeated two or three times. If the needle become plugged, it is better to abandon the operation at once, as further attempts would probably meet with no better success. After the operation taxis may be immediately employed, and if it fail the ordinary- operation must be performed. Further evidence is required to establish the true value of aspiration, but it has been performed sufficiently often to show that if needles of the proper size be used carefully, it is almost, if not absolutely, innocuous. Dieulafoy records 27 cases, 20 of which were suc- cessful, reduction of the gut by taxis following the operation. In the remaining 7 it was haimless, and of these 3 died and 4 recovered, after the ordinary operation for hernia. At University College Hospital aspiration has been tried 7 times. In 1 case only was it followed by reduction ; in 1 the fluid from the sac only was withdrawn, yet the impulse returned and the patient recovered, though the hernia remained um-educed ; in 4 it failed entirely, and the ordinary operation was performed in 3 cases successfully. In the fatal case two days after the operation the punctures could not be found at the post-mortem examination. In the remaining case the patient was moribund at the time, and died a few minutes after the operation. At the post-mortem no gas or fluid could be squeezed from the pmictiues in the gut. It seems, therefore, that the danger of fsecal extravasation is very small, although it is said to have occuiTed. The operation may fairly be tried in suitable cases, especially when the hernia is resonant on percussion, and only recently strangulated. It would be unwise to attempt it when fr'om the diua- tiou of the strangulation inflammation or gangrene of the gut might be . suspected.655 OBLIQUE INGUINAL HERNIA. CHAPTEE LXIII. ——4— SPECIAL HERNLZE. INGUINAL HEBNIA. By Inguinal Hernia is meant that protrusion which occupies the whole or a portion of the inguinal canal, and when fully formed, passes out of the external abdominal ring into the scrotum. Many varieties of this hernia are recognised by Surgeons. Thus it is said to be Gom'plete, when it passes out of the external ring; IncorwgMe, or Interstitial, so long as it is contained within the canal ; Oblique, when it occupies the whole com’se of the canal; Direct, when it passes forwards through a limited extent of it; Congenital, when it lies in the sac of the tunica vaginalis ; and Encysted, or Infantile, when it lies behind this. Inguinal hernise constitute the commonest species of ruptm-e, and would be much more frequent than they are, were it not for the obliquity of the canal, and the mamier in which its sides are applied to one another, and closely overlap the spermatic cord. They occur with most readiness in those cases in which the canal is short and the apertures wide. Although these hernite ai-e commonly incomplete in their early stages, it is seldom that they come under the observation of the Surgeon until the protru- sion has passed beyond the abdominal ring. Oblique Inguinal Hernia, often called External, on account of its relation to the epigastric artery, passes through the whole length of the canal, from one ring to the other ; and usually protrudes through the external one, constituting one of the forms of Scrotal Hernia. Coverings.—As it passes along the canal, it necessarily receives the same investments that the spermatic cord does; although these are often greatly modified by being elongated, hypertrophied, and otherwise altered in appear- ance. If we regard the inguinal canal as consisting of a series of invaginations of the different layers of the abdominal parietes, the outermost being the skin, and the innermost the fascia transversalis, with the peritoneum applied to this, it is easy to understand how the hernia in its descent has these pro- longations drawn over it, thus becoming successively invested with the same coverings as the spermatic cord. Thus it fii-st pushes before it that portion of the peritoneum which lies in a fossa just external to the epigastric vessels ; it next receives an investment from the subperitoneal fat, which, uniting with the fascia transversalis, constitutes the fascia propria of the sac ; as it passes under the internal oblique, it receives some of the fibres of this muscle, in the shape of the cremasteric fascia; and, lastly, when it reaches the externalSPECIAL IIERNIAE. 6s6 abdominal ring, which it greatly distends and renders round and open, it becomes covered by the intercolnmnar fascia, receiving also a partial invest- ment around its neck from some of the expanded and thickened fiI)rons bands that lie near the ring, and Avliich are always most marked upon its outer side. Relations.—The relations of the spermatic cord and testes, and of the epigastric artery, to an inguinal hernia, are of groat importance. The sjier- matic cord vdll almost invariably bo found to be situated behind or rather underneath the oblique inguinal hernia ; and the testis will be found to lie at its lower and back part, where it may always be distinctly felt. In some cases the elements of the spermatic cord become separated, the vas deferens lying on one side, and the spermatic vessels on the other. In other rare cases, an instance of which there is in a preparation in the University College Museum, the hernia lies behind the cord and has the testis in front. In other cases, again, it may happen that the elements of the cord are all separately spread out on the forepart of the hernial tumoiu’. The epirjastric artenj has the same relations to the obhque inguinal hernia that it has to the spermatic cord, lying to the inner side of and behind its neck. The pressure of large and old inguinal hemise has, however, a tendency to modify somewhat the relations of this vessel. By distending the rings, and dragging the posterior wall of the canal downwards and inwards, they shorten the canal, and cause a great deflexion of the artery from its natural course, which is changed from an oblique direction to one curved doAvnwards and inwards, under the outer edge of the rectus muscle. Direct Ihguixal Herjiia.—This does not pass out like the obhque through the internal abdominal ring, but pushes forwards through a triangular space,, which is bounded by the epigastric artery on the outer side, the edge of the rectus on the inner, and the cnu’al arch at its base ; through this the hernial tumour protrudes, pushing before it or ruptm-ing the posterior wall of the inguinal canal. Coverings.—These vary according to the length of the canal that the hernia traverses, and the portion of the posterior wall through which it pro- trudes. In fact, there are at least two distinct forms of direct inguinal hernia, which differ according as they are situated above or below the remains of the umbiheal artery. One, the most common variety, is situated below the cord- like remains of this vessel, between it and the outer edge of the rectus. The other, which is of less frequent occurrence, is situated above this vessel, between it and the epigastric artery. In that form of direct inguinal hernia, which lies toeloxo the umbilical artenj, the protrusion takes place through that part of the posterior nail of the inguinal canal which is situated almost behind and opposite to the external i-ing. In this situation, the investments successively received by the hernia aret first, the peritoneum, the subperitoneal fat, and the fascia transversalis ; it then comes into contact with the conjoined tendons of the internal obhque and transversalis muscles, which it may either rupture or push before it, thinned out and expanded. Most frequently these are ruptured, constituting a partial investment to the protrusion, which is most evident on the most part of the sac, that which is nearest the mesial line. As tneING UINA L HERNIA. 657 li6rniti pusses tliroiigh the cxtcrntil £ibcloiiiiii<il it receives ftom it the intercolurnnai’ ftxsciti find fibres, tind lastly is invested by the common fascia and integuments. In the direct ingiunal hernia which lies alove the umbilical artery, Avhich is of rare occurrence, the protrusion may pass under the lower edge of the transvcrsalis muscle, and then receives a partial investment of cremas- teric fascia, especially on its ihac side, as it comes into relation with the internal oblique. This form of direct inguinal hernia, therefore, receives very nearly the same covering that the oblique does, though its investment by the cremaster is not so perfect. It does not come into relation with the conjoined tendons. Relations.—In the direct inguinal hernia, the spermatic cord lies to the outer side of the sac ; and its elements are never separated from one another, as occasionally happens in the oblique. The epigastric artery also is on the outer side, but usually arches very distinctly over the neck of the sac, some- times indeed completely encircling the upper as well as the outer margin (Fig. G82). IsrcoiiPLETE OR Interstitial Hernia is usually of the oblique kind; but Lawrence has observed that it may be of the direct variety. It often escapes notice, but may not unfrequently be observed on the opposite side to an ordinary inguinal hernia. Double Inguinal Herniae, on opposite sides, are of very common _ occun-ence, and they may be of the same, or assume different forms. In some * instances, the two forms may be observed on the same side (Fig. 683). In females, inguinal hernia are much less frequent than in males. They Fig.C82 .—Double Direct Inguiiml Heniia : Neck of Sac crossed by Epigastric Arteiy. Fig. 0S3.—Double Inguinal Heniia on the same side : ObUque above. Direct below ; separated by Epi- gastric Vessels. may occur at aU ages, but seldom come under the notice of the Surgeon except at advanced periods of life. They have the same relations as in the male except that the round ligament is substituted for the spermatic cord VOL. II, ^ ’ u uSPECIAL JIERNTJI 6sS Signs.—The signs of inguinal hernia vary somewhat according to its character, whether interstitial, complete, or scrotal, oblique or direct. In ] the mtcrsHHal hernia, a degTCC of fulness will be perceived in the canal when L the patient stands or coughs ; and, on pressing the finger on the internal ring, H or passing it up into the external ring, and directing the patient to cough, a I distinct impulse, together wdth tumour, may be felt. In the ordinary ohlique K inf/uinal hernia, a tumour of an oblong or oval shape, oblique in its direction, V taking the course of the canal downwards and forwards, will be felt protruding 1 through the external abdominal ring, and presenting all the usual signs of a | hernia. So long as it is confined to the neighbourhood of the pubes, it is of ] moderate size ; but when once it enters the scrotum, where it meets with less resistance, it may gradually enlarge until it attains an enormous bulk. The testicle, however, may always be felt tolerably distinct at its posterior inferior part. In women this form of hernia descends into the labium, but never attains the same magnitude as in men. When of large size, these ruptures usually contain both intestine and omentimi, most frequently a portion of the ileum, though the various other viscera, such as the cascum, bladder, &c., have been found in them. In the direct inguinal hernia, the symptoms closely resemble those of the oblique, except that the tumour is more rounded, and usually not so large; the neck is wider, and situated near the root of the penis, wdth the cord on its outer side. Roser directs attention to the important fact that the oblique or external inguinal hernia is most common in young males, whilst the internal or direct inguinal hernia is almost confined to elderly men. This appears to be owing to the imperfect closure of the fascicular process of the peritoneum being the common cause of the first, and adipose absorption of the second form. The different forms of inguinal hernia are not unfrequently complicated with various other affections ; either vdth different kinds of rupture, or 'with diseases of the cord or testis, such as hydrocele of the cord or of the tunica vaginahs, or varicocele. These various complications necessarily make the diagnosis somewhat more obscure, but wdth care and practice it may generally easily be made out. Diagnosis.—The diagnosis of inguinal hernia is usually readily effected, the characters and position of the tumour enabling the Surgeon to detennine its true nature. In most cases it is useless to endeavour to ascertain whether the hernia is oblique or direct; all old oblique hernia having a tendency to drag the inner ring downwards and inwards, approximating it and bringing it nearly opposite to the outer one, shortening and destroying the obliquity of the canal. Hence the direction of the neck and of the axis of the tmnour in these cases so nearly resembles what is met vdth in the direct form of hernia, that the Surgeon should not attempt to undertake an operation, more particularly the division of the stricture, on any imaginary diagnosis. ^ Some forms of femoral hernia may occasionally be confounded with the inguinal; the distinguishing i points between these two forms of the disease will be considered in the section on femoral hernia. _ ...... i ^ The diagnosis of inguinal hernia from other diseases in this vicinity has to be considered under the two conditions in which the rupture is found,—!, %n the canal, and 2, in the scrotum.u u 2 C59 DIAGNOSIS OF INGFIiYAL HERNIA. 1. Whilst still lyinc; in the canal, inguinal hernia requires to be diagnosed from the following conditions, a. Ahscess^, descending from the interior of the nbdomen or pelvis through the canal, and passing out through the abdominal ring. The diagnosis may here be ellected by recognising the soft fluctuating foef of the abscess, wliich, though reducible on pressime, and descending on ■coughing with a distinet impulse, does not present the more solid characters mKUhc°gurgling sensation of a hernia, h. Encysted or Diffused Hydrocele of the Cord, lii the encysted hydrocele there is a smooth oval swelling situated on the cord, which can be apparently reduced, being pushed up into the canal, und descends again on coughing or straining; but it may be distinguished from hernia by being always of the same size, by not being reducible into the cavity of the abdomen, by the absence of all giu’gle, and by its very deflned outline. In the diffused hydroceleoit\yQ cord, the absence of distinct impulse on coughing, the impossibility of retimning the swelling completely within the abdominal ca^•ity, and of feeling the cord in a free and natural state, will prevent the disease from being confounded with hernia, c. Hmmatocele of the Cord. Here the soft and fluctuating nature of the swelling, the ecchymosis, the impossi- bility of complete reduction, and the absence of gurgling, will indicate its true nature, d. Fatly or other Tumours occasionally form on the cord; but the cir- ■cumscribed character and limited size of these swellings, the absence of impulse •on coughing, and of reducibility into the cavity of the abdomen, will point out that they are not hernite. e. Lodyment of the Testis in the Inguinal Canal give rise to a tumoiu', which closely resembles incomplete inguinal hernia: and if it should happen to become inflamed in this situation, the difficulty of the •diagnosis from strangulated hernia may be very considerable. In the ordinary undescended testis, the absence of that organ in the scrotum on the affected side, the peculiar sickening pain occasioned by the pressime of the tumoiu’, the iibs ence of gm’gling, and of aU possibility of reduction, w^ill enable the diagnosis to be effected. /. Inflamed Undescended Testis. From this it is not always at •once easy to eflect the diagnosis of incomplete inguinal hernia in a state of strangulation, mth which indeed it may be complicated. This diagnostic point will be more fuUy treated of in speaking of congenital hernia. In the mean- while, it may be stated that the absence of persistent and continuous vomiting ?md constipation, the feel of the tumour, hard below, elastic abms’e, and the peculiar pain when it is compressed, will enable the Surgeon to recognise the true nature of the tumour as being a retained and inflamed testis. 2. hen the hernia has descended into the scrotum, it may be confounded with : a. Ilydrocele of the Tunica Vaginalis. In this disease there is an •oval or pyriform tumour, usually translucent, unchangeable in size or shape by pressure, and having the cord clear and distinct above it, with an absence of impulse on coughing, or of gurgling in attempts at reduction. In cases of •congenita,] hydrocele in children, in which there is still an opening commiuii- cating with the peritoneal cavity, the tumour may be diminished in size by steady pressure, but gradually returns, fluctuates, and is translucent. In these cases its translucency, and the gradual manner in which the sac is emptied and is refilled, very different from the sudden slip np and protrusion of a hernia, ■enable the Surgeon to establish the diagnosis. It not unfrequently happens that icrnia is complicated vnth hydrocele of the tunica vaginalis. In these cases theSPECIAL I/ERNTjE. 66o two separate tumours can usually be distinguished, there being some degree of constriction, or of consolidation, between them. The hydrocele will present its ordinary characters of transluccncy, in-cducibility, and circumscribed outline, and is commonly jdaced anterior to the hernia, which lies towards the back of the scrotum, and may be distinguished by its reducibility and impulse on coughing. It sometimes happens, as in a case which once fell under my ob- servation, that a hydroceh of the cord is associated with one of the tunica vaginalis- and a hernia; in such circumstances, the diagnosis requires a little care, but may be effected readily enough by separately determining the characters of the different swellings. 1. Varicocele. Here the diagnosis 7nay be effected in the way pointed out by Sir A. Cooper. The patient should be placed in the re- cumbent position, and the swelling reduced ; the Surgeon then presses upon the. external ring with his fingers, taking care to cover the whole of it, and desires the patient to stand up. If it be a hernia, the tumour cannot descend ; but if it be a varicocele, it will speedily reappear iihilst the pressure is leing Icept up^ the blood being conveyed into it through the spermatic arteries, c. Tumours of the Testis. These may be distinguished from hernia by their solid feel,, rounded shape, by the absence of aU impidse on coughing, and, especially, by the cord being felt free and clear above them, and the inguinal canal imoccupied. d. Eccmatocele of the Tunica Vaginalis. Here the cause of the swelling, its. pyi'iform shape, opacity, solid feel, the absence of impulse on coughing, and the defined characters of the cord, will enable the Siugeon to make the diagnosis. Treatment.—When inguinal hernia is reducible, the rupture must be kept up by a well made truss, the pad of which, of an oval shape, shonld press not only upon the external ring, but upon the whole length of the canal. It is in this form of hernia that the various operations for the radical cure are most applicable. When it is irreducible, and of large size, nothing can be done, beyond supporting it in a bag-truss. Operation.—When the hernia is strangulated, if the taxis properly employed in the direction of the canal have failed, the operation must be performed in the fcUoAving way. The bladder having been emptied and the pubes shaved, the patient should be brought to the edge of the bed; and the Surgeon, stand- ing between his legs, and having the skin covering the external ring well pinched up, divides the fold in the usual way, by an incision tluee inches- in length, commencing about an inch above the external abdominal ring. Should any spouting vessels, as the external pudic, be divided in this incision, they had better be ligatui-ed. The Surgeon then proceeds with the section through the subcutaneous structures; he wiU, in many cases, find the superficial fascia considerably thickened, particularly if the patient have long worn a truss. He divides this structure in the line of the external incision, and then exposes, the intercolumnar fascia, which will also generally be found thickened, and incorporated with the superficial fascia. In many cases, the intercolumnar fibres mil be found condensed into a thick and broad fiUct, which limits the further extension of the ring, and produces. an evident constriction upon the neck of a large inguinal hernia. An opening should be cai’efidly made intO' this fascia, a grooved director passed under the edge of the ring, and this slit up. In some cases, though but very rarely, it will now be found that the herniaOPEFiATIONS FOR INCOMPLETE INGUINAL HERNIA. 66r may be reduced, its strangulation depending on the of this aperture’; most commonly, however, the stricture is situated deeper th;m •this The cremasteric fascia, which is generally considerably tluckened, is now oxnosed when its fibres will be found to form a kind of reticulated mesh over the hernial timiour. This structure must be cai’efully divided upon a director, >vhen the trausversalis foscia and subserous areolar tissue, ov fascia pro])na,yn\\ Ije laid bare. This structure is usually thickened and vascular, and not unfre- ouently the stricture appears to be situated in it, or in a kind of condensed ring formed by the incoi-poration of it with the meshes of the cremaster. If it be found, after the division of these faseije, that the hernia can be reduced, it wouM of coiu*sc be uimecessary to lay open the sac ; and the safety of the patient will be considerably enhanced, more particularly if the operation be perfoimed for 4111 old scrotal hernia of large size, by not doing so. If, however, as will happen in the majority of instances in inguinal hernia, it be found that the stricture is in the neck of the sac itself, occasioned by a condensation, constriction, and puckering of it, the sac must be carefully opened at its anterior part, the finger introducSl, and the stricture divided from within, by pressing the finger-nail under it, and cautiously sliding the hernia-knife along this. It is an established xule in sm-gery, that this division should be effected in a direction immediately upwards, so that it may lie parallel with the epigastric vessels, whether it be .situated upon the inner or outer side of these. It is true that, if the Sm'geon <iould be sine that he had to do mth an oblique inguinal hernia, he might safely <livide the stricture outwards ; or, if he were certain that the protrusion was of the direct kind, he might make the section inwards ; but, as it commonly hap- pens that he cannot determine with absolute certainty upon which hernia he is operating, he adopts the safer plan recommended by Sir A. Cooper and Lawrence, of cutting upwards from the middle of the ring parallel to the epigastric vessels. The Seat of Stricture in inguinal hernia ^will thus be seen to differ in •different cases ; and in some instances it exists in two situations. I think it most commonly ocem’s in the neck of the sac, oiving to contraction and elonga- tion of it, mth condensation of the subserous ai-eolar tissue lying immediately upon it. In other cases, though much more rarely, it seems to be formed by a thickeniug of the trausversalis fascia in the inner ring, but altogether outside the sac. Occasionally it is met ivith in some part of the canal, at the lower •edge of the internal oblique, but much more frequently at the external abdominal ring. In many cases there is very tight constriction in this situation, as well as in the deeper portions of the canal, or at the inner ring ; hence, after the division of any stricture at the external abdominal ring, the deeper portions of the canal should always be carefully examined before any attempt is made to put the hernia back. The operation for an Incomplele Inguinal Hernia requires to be conducted in the same way as that which has just been described, except that the incision ueed not be quite so long, and should not extend beyond the external ring. After this, has been laid open, and the tendon of the external oblique slit up, a flat director must be passed under the lower edge of the internal oblique and transversalis muscles, which must be carefully divided ; should the stricture not be relieied in this way, and the sac require to bo laid open, the deep section662 SPECIAL llEENPK. must be made in the same way and in the same direction as has already been described. In Ingtiinal Herniae, containing either the Casenm, the Sigmoid Flexure of the Colon, or the Urinary Bladder, the lorotruded risccra arc- only partially covered by peritoneum ; hence, in operating upon such hernife, when strangulated, care must be taken that the contents be not wounded, which is apt to occur if the Sm’geon divide the parts without due caution, not sus- pecting himself to have reached the neighbourhood of the viscus, but believing- that he has met Avith a sac Avhich does not exist. As the protruded parts ai’e generally adherent in these cases, the Surgeon must content himself Avith leav- ing them unreduced after the division of the stricture ; in such circumstances,, it has happened that the inotrusion is ultimately draAvn back into the abdomen by some natimal action of the parts. Operations for strangulated ingumal hernia are required during a greatei- range of ages than those for any other kind of protrusion. I have operated successfully for congenital hernia in infants less than six weeks old, and for ordinary oblique inguinal hernia at seven Aveeks and at four months of age ; and the operation has been done on centenarians. IITien small and recent,, the protrusion usually consists of intestine only; when large, it commonly contains omentum as weU. The treatment of these contents, and the after- management of the case, must be conducted in accordance Avdth the rules laid down at pages 6-I0 et seq. vol. II. Hernia in the Tunica Vaginalis : Congenital Hernia.—In this case- the hernia descends inside the tunica vaginahs, which constitutes its sac. It is. always oblique, and takes the course of the spermatic- cord ; most commonly descending into the scrotum,, but sometimes lying within the canal, out of which perhaps the testis has imperfectly passed. This hernia differs from an ordinary obhque hernia in the absence- of a true peritoneal sac, and in the protruded parts lying- in the tunica vaginalis and in contact AAuth the testicle; (Fig. G8I). The great peculiarity, indeed, of this, hernia, consists in its descending along the canal left open by the descent of the testis. In the foetus the testis originally lies below the kidney, and, as it descends in the later months of intra-uterine life into- the inguinal canal and scrotiun, it puUs doAvn a pro- longation of the peritoneum, exactly resembhng a hernial sac. In addition to this defective closuie of the Taginal process of the peritoneum, there is another anatomical con- dition which tends to the formation of a congenital ingninai hernia—ns., an ahnoi-mally long mesentery. This, unlike the open peiatoneal process, is not necessary to the formation of the hernia, but when existing it is a mateiial factor in its production. And it is attended by this serious inconreiiience. that it is an obstacle to the radical cure of the hernia by the closure of the open funicular process of peritoneum by the pressure of a trass. That prolongation of the peritonoimi which is carried down ® in its deroent, may be dirided into two portions, the fiiiiicular and the testi- Fig. 684.—CongciiitaTl Hernia.663 VAGINALIS. lIEliNIA OF THE TUNICA cuhu- The funicular is that which coiTCspoiids to the cord,_ extending fiom the internal i-iiKi- to the scrotum; the lostimlar is that which becomes the tunica va-inalis. A congenital licmia occiu-3 in consequence of the “ prolongato. not becoming, as in the noi-mal mentous hbio-celluto tissue, but remaining pernous, and thus as a inn of commnnication between the genci-al cavity of the peritoneum and Te tunica vaginalis ; and along the open channel thus left the conpnital hernia descends The reason whv in many cases the hernia is not truly congenital, but occurs ill after-lite, is that the funicular portion is only pai-tially closed or contracted, and that, under a sudden effort, the septum is broken through, and thus a knuckle of gut falls into the tunica vaginahs. _ blernia of the tunica vaginalis, though usually called “ congenital, is lare y so in reality ; the tendency is congenital, but the disease is not. It not unfrp- quently happens, it is true, that these hernim show themselves early in Me, in infants a few weeks or months old ; though at these ages even the funiculai prolongation of the peritoneum may be so completely occluded, that the hernia Avhich occui-s is of an ordinary oblique character. Kot uiifrequently, however, the hernia docs not take place until a considerably later period of life than this, and may suddenly happen in the adult; thus Velpeau relates instances in which it ocem-red lor the first time betAveen the ages of eighteen and twenty-five. I have operated in a case on a man thirty-five years of age, in whom this kind of hernia occiuTed for the first time when he was twelve years old ; and some years ago in a case at the Hospital, on a man about fifty, in Avhom, on the most care- ful inquuy, it woidd appear that the protrusion had not showm itself until he was about thirty years of age. Signs and Diagnosis.—The signs of hernia in the tunica vaginalis closely re- semble those of the ordinary oblique ; most commonly, however, if scrotal, the tumour is much rounded, and the neck feels narrow and constricted. The testis, also, cannot be felt distinct and separate from the tumour, but is sm’- roimded by, and, as it were, buried in the substance of the hernia, through Avhich it may sometimes be felt at the lower and back part of the scrotum. On inquiry, also, it Avill usually be found either that the hernia has existed in childhood, or the testis is still in the canal, or has descended later than usual. A hernia of the tunica vaginalis may be associated with a congenital hydrocele. In these cases, after the fluid has been returned into the peritoneal caAuty by directing the patient to lie on his back, and raising the scrotum, the portion of protruded giit may be felt and recognised by its gurgle and upward slip when reduced. This hernia may be associated with the testis in two conditions— viz., either undescended, lying in the canal or at the anterior abdominal ring, or higher up in the canal. In the first case, the hernia is, of com’se, incom- plete ; in the second, it is scrotal. When incomplete, the diagnosis may be made by feeling a soft swelling with the ordinary hernial signs above the small and laardened testis. When symptoms of strangulated hernia occur in a person in wMom the tesies have not descended into the scrotum, very great difficulty may be experienced in effecting an exact diagnosis. In such cases as these, an oblong or rounded tumom-, tense and painful, Avill be found to occupy the inguinal canal, not passing beyond the external ring, with some abdominal tenderness, and possilfiy nauseadown on the tumoiu and examine its composition.

Is it simply an inflamed undescended testis; or is it an undescended testis, inflamed or not, as the case may be, having a knuckle or loop of strangulated intestine lying behind it ? When the tumour simply consists of an inflamed undescended testis, the pain will be of that peculiar character which is indicative of orchitis, and the constitutional symptoms of strangulation, however simulated for a time, will not be persistently present. The following case is a good illustration of this condition. A man, aged about forty, said to be labouring under strangulated hernia, was sent up from the country for operation. On being called to him, I found the house-sm’geon attempting the reduction of the tumour in the hot bath ; but as soon as I felt the swelling, I was convinced, from its hard, solid, and irregular feel, that it was not a hernia. On inquiring into the history of the case, it appeared that the patient had for the last two days suffered from occasional vomiting, and had been constipated ; that the tumom- in the groin had not appeared suddenly, though it had enlarged with gveat rapidity ; that - it was excessively painful; and that he had always worn a truss for a supposed ruptui’e on that side, until the last few weeks, when, in consequence of the instrument breaking, he had discontinued it. On examining the gvoiii care- fully, a tumoiu- about as large as the fist was found in the right inguinal canal; it was tender to the touch, hard, and irregular at the upper and outer part, but somewhat soft and fluctuating below; when the finger was passed into the external ring, the outline, of the tumour could be very distinctly felt in the canal. There was no impulse in it on coughing, but some abdominal tender- ness on that side. The right testis was not in the scrotum. I ordered the man to be bled, the tumour to be leeched, and salines administered : under this treatment the case did well. When a knuckle of strangulated intestine hes behind and above the testis, still retained above the external ring, the symp- toms of strangulation will be violent and persistent; and this, even though the tumoiu present but httle the feel or the ordinary character of a hernia. In fact, in such a case, the Sm-geon is guided by the character of the general symptoms, and not by those of the local tumour. In a case of this kind to which I was called, there could be felt behind and above an inflamed and swollen testicle, which lay at the external abdominal ring, a small, hard, round tumoiu in the upper portion of the canal. As symptoms of strangulation were urgent, this was cut down upon, the anterior wall of the canal was incised, and the tunica vaginalis, much distended with fluid, was laid open, when a small knuckle of intestine was found lying at its upper part, very tightly constricted by the inner ring. But in other cases the diagnosis is not so easy ; the whole tumoiu lying in the canal feels smooth, elastic, and uniform, so that no manual examination can enable the Surgeon to say with certainty whether the tumom is an inflamed testis surrounded by fluid in a distended tiuiica vaginalis, or whether there is a loop of intestine lying above an undescended testis. In such cases as these, however, the Surgeon is guided in the course he should adopt by the symptoms. If these indicate strangulation of intestine, and persist after a reasonable time has been consumed in the application of leeches and the administration of purgatives, he should, without further delay, cuencysted hernia of tunica vaginalis. 66s tl,c hitonal ring « iH rcquiro division, tbo iutcsthio must be reduced, and the testis T)ut back in the canal. _ . in- TreLuenf.-Thc treatment of congenital lieniia consists in the the tumour, and the application of a proper truss, the pad of which should compress the whole length of the inguinal canal. In children a radical cure may be etfected in this way ; but, in order to accomplish this desirable result, the truss must be worn for several years. The applicatmn of a truss with an_ air-pad will in many instances be found especially useful, as it applies itseii with fn-cater exactness than an ordinary incomprossMe one. In applying the truss,*carc must be taken not to compress the testis if undescended. In order to avoid this, the lower end of the pad may be cut out so as to be conca'^ e, and thus press down the testis while it supports the hernia. ■\Vhen strangulated, congenital hernia does not commonly admit of reduc- tion, and thus necessarily renders an operation imperative. The procedure is more commonly req^uired for this kind of hernia in adults than in infants. The operation is the same as that for oblique inguinal hernia, but the parts concenied are usually thimier, the timica vaginalis serving for a sac ; hence more caution than usual is required in these cases. The sac commonly con- tains a hu’ge quantity of fluid, usually clear, but often dark in coloim, there being, in fact, a hydrocele conjoined with the hernia. The strictiu’c will iilways be foimd in the neck of the sac, which appears to be condensed, elon- gated, and narrowed ; hence it is useless in these cases to endeavour to relieve the strangulation, without laying open the sac, and dividing its neck from within. As the congenital hernia is always external to the epigastric vessels, the section of the strictm’e may be done with perfect safety in a direction up- wai’ds and outwards, though, if the Surgeon should have any doubt as to the exact nature of the case, it wiU be better to divide the strieture directly upwards. The strictme, in fact, appears to be formed by the imperfect contraction of that portion of the funicular prolongation of the peritoneum, wkich normally becomes obhterated before birth, and establishes the separation betw^een the tw'o serous sacs of the tunica vaginalis and of the peritoneum. The reduction of the contents of the hernia will in the adult often be prevented by adhesions in the neck of the sac, or between them and the testis. I have found both the gut and omentum closely incorporated with this organ, and requiring some nice dissection to separate them. In operating upon infants of a very tender nge, much caution wiU necessarily be demanded, on account of the tenuity of the coverings, their tension, and the small size of the apertimes. The testis, as well as the spermatic cord, the veins of which are excessively tm’gid, come into view', and will usually be found much congested, and of a black or bluish- lack colour. A species of congenital hernia has been met with in the female, especially in children, in which the protrusion takes place into the canal of Nuck, which invests the round ligament. In one instance, I have seen a double inguinal hernia in a girl of five years old. It is of extremely rare occiuTence, and requires the same treatment as the coiresponding disease in the male. Excysted Heuxia of the Tuhica Yaginajhs, ok Infantile Hernia, as it has been somewhat absiu’dly termed, occurs in those cases in which the funicular portion of the tunica vaginalis is partly obstructed by a septum, or by being666 SPECIAL IIEUNIJ':. 1 cou^■ertecl into filamentous tissue, but in such a way as to IcaA’e a pouch abo-s-e, Avhich is protruded doAvn behind or into the tunica vaginalis, so that it lies behind this cavity (Fig. (585). There arc no characters byAvhich the encysted can be distinguished from the ordinary congenital hernia. If it should become strangulated, it must be borne in mind that dining the operation the tunica vaginalis will first be opened ; no hernia will be seen here, but the tumour lies behind this sac, and requires to be dissected into through the double serous layer of which it is composed. The stricture will probably be in the neck, and requires to be divided in the usual way. FEMORAL HERNIA. By Femoral Kernia is meant a protrusion that escapes mider Poupart’s ligament, and enters the sheath of the vessels internally to the femoral vein. This hernia passes down to the innermost compart- ment of the sheath, which is occupied by fat and lymphatics, and usually contains a gland or two. It passes first of all through the crural ring, where it has Gimbernat’s ligament to its inner side ; the septum which separates the femoral vein from the inner compartment of the sheath of the vessels, to its outer aspect; Poupart’s liga- ■n-.m-.i-. 5n frnr.1-. • n-nrl thc boiic behind (Fia-.

As it approaches the lower corner of the saphenous opening where the canal terminates, it passes under the falciform process of the fascia lata, and out upon the thigh through the saphenous apertine ; hem it expands, becomes rounded, and has often a tendency to turn upWs cnex Pmipart’s ligament (Fig. G87), lying in this way upon the sometimes even ascending to some distance upon the anterior abdominal .667 femoral hernia. Ill the descent of the hernia through this course, it first of all pushes before it Ihetritmieal sac, and then receives an investment of the subserous areolar tissue—the septum crurale, a mass of dense areolar tissue, containing fat mid Ijinphatics, occnpyn'S ""S' “f"” statb eoiDomted ami matted with the contigiions portion of the sheath thus con stitTitim>-the fascia propria of this hernia, which is commonly thichencd, lamtated, and of an opaque fatty structure, like omentum. As the hernia continues to descend, it comes into relation Avith the cribriform fascia, which occupies the saphenous opening, and, lastly, pushes before it the integumental As the tumour descends through this coiu’se, it necessarily comes into re- lation with very important parts (Fig. GS8). Thus it is separated fi;om tho femoral vein solely by tho septum of the sheath of the vessels. It has the- T-ia epigastric arteiy above and to its outer side ; and the spennatic cord in the male, or the round ligament in the female, almost immediately above it. The obturator arteiy, when arising in the normal manner from the internal iliac, does not come into relation with the neck of the sac ; but when it takes its origin, as it not unfrequently does, from the external iliac, the common femoral, or the epigastric, it may have important relations to this part of tho hernia. Most commonly, in these circumstances, it passes to the iliac or outer side of the neck, but occa- sionally it winds round its inner or pubic side, coming into rather close relation with it; and then, as will immediately bo mentioned, it may bo in considerable danger during the operation. The combination, however, of this particular variety of the obturator artery and femoral hernia, is a very uncommon occur- rence ; because, in tho first place, this internal distribution of the artery is rare ; and when it does occur, as it passes directly o-\'cr that portion of the crural ring through which the sac would protrude, it necessarily strengthens this, and so diminishes the chance of rapture. css.—1.

Occasionally omentum is •contained within the sac, but seldom in large quantity. I have, however, •several times had occasion to operate in cases of old femoral hernia, in which it became necessary to remove large portions of adherent omentum ; in one, ■ten and a half ounces, and in the other alDOut seven. In each case there was ;a small knuckle of intestine strangulated behind the omentum. The ovaries. Fallopian tubes, &c., have been known to bo strangulated in this variety of Jiernia. Signs.—The signs of femoral hernia are usually well marked. They consist ■of a tolerably firm, tense, and unyielding tumom-, of a rounded shape, ■situated in the groin, to the inner side of the femoral vessels, and to the outer side of the spine of the pubes, having its neck under Poupart’s ligament, though, as it increases m size, its base may be turned above the structure; sometimes, though rarely, it passes downwards upon the thigh. Its size varies •considerably ; most commonly it is not larger than a walnut or a pigeon’s egg, s,nd then is deeply seated in the angle between the body of the pubes and the femoral vessels ; but occasionally it may attain a considerable bulk, as large as ■the fist or a French roU. "When large, this hernia usually rises up above Poupart’s ligament, and extends outwards in a direction parallel to it, so that it assumes an elongated shape ; it is then usually somewhat doughy and soft, •even when strangulated ; very different from the excessively tense feel that it lias when small. In some rare cases the femoral hernia has been found lying external to the vessels, the mouth of the sac being between them and the iliac spine. In these circumstances strangulation cannot well occur, inasmuch as the mouth Avill be the widest part of the sac ; but, as Hesselbach has observed, if the fascia iliaca be torn by the pressure of the tumour, the rupture may be strangled in the apertoe thus formed. Should an operation ever be required in such •circumstances, it must be borne in mind that the circumfiex ilii artery may be in some danger. As a femoral hernia passes out through the crural ring, it comes into very •close relation to the femoral vein, being merely separated from the vessel by the septum, which divides the imier from the middle compartment of the femoral sheath. Were it not for this septum, as Poser has observed, the femoral vein would be compressed by the tense hernial tumour protruded between it and Glimbernat’s ligament, and the inevitable consequence would be oedema of the whole lower extremity. As the hernia pushes down in the •track of the crimal canal, it can make no impression on the inner or on the posterior wall of the canal—both of which are unyielding ; but, pushing the anterior wall upwards, it drags upon the septum on the outer side of the neck of the sac, renders this tense, and thus saves the femoral vein from compression. Diagnosis.—The diagnosis of femoral hernia is not always easy. "When the hernia is large, and more particularly when it rises up above Poupart’s liga- ment, which some hemim, even of very moderate size, are apt to do, it might at first be mistaken for an inguinal rupture. The diagnosis, howe^•cr, may usually be effected by ascertaining the relation that the neck of the sac as oDIAGNOSIS OF FEMORAL HERNIA. 669 Toupart’s ligament, the inguinal hernia being situated ahove, tlic femoral Moi(}- this cord. 'Vhen, however, a small femoral hernia in a fat man rises upwards, so as to lie over' Poupart’s ligament, it resembles very closely an incomplete- inguinal hernia ; but its characters may be determined by the passage of the- finder up the inguinal canal, which will be found to be free, and the hernia can only be felt through its posterior and inferior wall. In the female the- finger cannot be passed up the canal, but the inguinal heniia will descend into the''labium, and may thus be recognised from the femoral, which lies 111 the- upper and Inner part of the thigh. In both sexes the relations of the neck of the sac to the spinous process of the pubes, which can abs^ays be felt in the- fattest subjects, arc most important in a diagnostic point of view. In femoral hernia the spine is to the inner, in inguinal hernia to the outer side of the- protrusion ; and, should a patient happen to be the subject of both inguinal and femoral hemia3 on the same side, the spine would be felt between the two. After reducing a femoral hernia, the finger also can usually be pushed into the inferior aperture of the crural canal, Avhen the situation and sharp outline of the falciform process Avill determine the nature of the opening through which the protrusion has occuiTed. The diseases occurring in the groin, Avith A\'hich femoral hernia may most readily be confounded, are—1. Enlarged Lymphatic Olands in this situation. From these it may be distinguished by the absence of impulse in the glandular tumoin, and by the simultaneous enlargement of several glands. A small strangulated hernia may, however, co-exist Avith these ; being subjacent to, and covered in by them. I^Tien this is the case, and the local signs of hernia are obscure, whilst the symptoms of strangulation continue, an incision should be- made into the part, and the dissection carefully carried through and underneath the glands, with the view of determining AA'hether the hernia exist or not. 2. A small Fatty Growth has been met with in the crural canal, closely simu- lating a hernia. The want of impulse on coughing, together Avith its limited and doughy character, and the absence of circumscription in the tumour, will enable the Sm’geon to distinguish it from hernia. 3. Psoas Abscess not unfr-e- quently points very nearly in the situation of femoral hernia: fr’om this it may, hoAA'ever, be distinguished by its fluctuating feel, by its soft yet semi-elastic- character, and by the general history of the case. The impiflse on coughing,. Avhich is very distinct in the abscess, is commonly more forcible and direct than that of a hernia ; and although the purulent collection may in many cases be squeezed back into the abdomen when the patient lies down, yet it returns Avithout a gm-gle, and without that distinct slip AA’hich accompanies the reduction of a hernia. 4. Varix of the Saphena Vein is in some danger of' being confounded Avith heimia. It may, hoAvever, be distinguished from this by the impulse in it being less distinct than in hernia, and by the- cnlargcment of the loAvor part of the A'ein being marked in the varix, but not existing in the rupture. Femoral hernia most commonly occurs in women, and very seldom under the age of twenty ; differing in both these respects from the inguinal rupture. )Sir A. Cooper states that he had only seen three cases under the above age. It Aery seldom becomes strangulated at an early period of life, CA'en Avhen existing. I have had a girl of nineteen under my care with femoral hernia, in whom■670 SPECIAL HERE EE. strangulation had already occurred on four occasions ; reduction, however having- been happily effected each time. Treatment.—Tlie treatment of femoral hernia, when it is reducible, must be conducted in the ordinary way by the application of a proper truss. A ■cure, however, is never, I believe, effected by the pressure of a pad, as some- times happens in inguinal hernia ; owing probably to the rigidity and in- compressibility of the tendinous and aponeurotic structures through which this ruptm-e protrudes. It is often difficult to keep this form of hernia up by means of a truss. The best instrument for this purpose is the mocmain truss, which I have found to succeed when all others have failed. When the hernia is in-educible, it should be supported by means of a truss with a concave pad. When a femoral rupture is strangulated, reduction should be effected either by taxis or by operation as speedily as possible, gangrene more rapidly ensuing in this than in any other form of hernia. In attempting the taxis, the structmes in the groin should be well relaxed by flexing the thigh upon the abdomen, und adducting it, which relaxes the margin of the saphenous opening; if it ■do not succeed with the assistance of the means recommended at p. (131, Yol. II., the operation should be proceeded -with at once. The operation for strangulated femoral hernia may be undertaken earlier and with a better prospect of success than that for any other form of rupture ; this is owing to the strictm-e being so commonly seated outside the sac, that the operation usually admits of being ■completed without implicating the peritoneum. The advantage of this mode of procedure in femoral hernia has been fully pointed out by A. Key, Luke, ;and Gay, and is now very generally recognised in practice. Gay, more par- ticmlarly, has pointed out that the stricture may commonly be divided without •opening the sac, by making a very limited incision on the inner sm-face of the neck of the tumour ; and he observes that the operation undertaken in this manner is little more than the taxis with the addition of a superficial incision. There is, however, this important difference between a hernia reduced by the ■ordinary simple taxis and one returned by Petit’s operation, that the strangu- lation in the latter case has been far tighter, or the operation would not have been necessary, and the consequent injury to the protruded parts is much more •severe. The stricture in femoral hernia is often found to l^e occasioned by the pres- sure of the criu’al arch. La-wi-ence states that it may be most effectually nelieved by di^uding the thin posterior border of this arch near the pubes. Other Surgeons recommend that the sharp edge of Gimbernat’s ligament shoidd be divided; and others again that the division should be made at the junction of Gimbernat’s and Poupart’s ligaments—through those ligamentous bands which Avere first described by Hey, under the term of the “ femoral ligament ” (1803), though subsequently (1814) he dropped this designation (they are noA\ some- times called “ Key’s ligament ”)—or at the inner edge of the falciform iwocess; and, indeed, it is in this situation that both Lawrence and Hey direct the incision to be made. In operating for femoral hernia, I have certainly most frequently found the stricture still to continue after the division of these ligamentous structm-es, and to be occasioned by fibrous bands, often very distinct, narrow, and glistening, lying across the neck of the sac in the fascia piopria 0 icOPERATIOX FOR FEMORAL HERNIA. 671 hernia • and I agTCC with the opinion expressed by Sir A. Cooper, that tlie nock of the sheath is the common seat of strangulation in femoral henna ; these transverse fibres, which sometimes appear to be partially reticulated, consisting probably of a condensation of the tendinous fibres that arc normally found m the sheath of the vessels. In order to expose them, it is comumn y neccssaiy to draw the neck of the sac well domi, when they will be seen deeply to indent and constrict it. • i The operation without opening the sac may most conveniently be iiei- formed when the tumour is small, by making an incision by transfixion along the inner side of its neck, and then dissecting through the superficial structures until the fiiscia propria is brought into view and carefully opened, and the sac exposed. The point of the finger should then be carried to the lower side of this, well luider the fascia propria. The finger-nail or flat director may then be insinuated under the sharp edge of Gimbernat’s ligament; which, at the point ef junction with Poiipart’s, may be divided upwards and inwards to the extent ■of a line or two by means of a hernia-knife. By this incision, not only is the •eige of Gimbernat’s and Poiipart’s ligaments dnided, but also the condensed and compressed fascia propria lying between the sac and the inner side of the •crinal arch. The reduction may now be attempted, and often effected : should ■any obstacle exist, the neck of the sac must be well drawn down and exposed, and any transverse bands situated upon it dissected through with the scalpel and forceps, or divided on a director. These bands lie in the fascia propria ; and when they are found, it is usually owing to the Surgeon not having exposed the neck of the sac sufficiently before passing his nail or director under the stricture. It is owmg to the incision being confined to the constriction occa- sioned by the crinal arch only, not including, as it ought to do, the subjacent condensed fascia propria ; a point of very great practical importance. Some- times this condensed and constricting portion of the fascia propria is so closely incorporated with the neck of the sac, that it camiot be divided without open- ing the latter. The operation performed in this way, without opening the sac, is certainly a very simple procedure ; and adds little if anything—nothing more, in fact, than a simple incision through superficial structures—to the danger of the patient. If it be thought desirable to open the sac, or if it be necessary to do so in consequence of its incorporation with the fascia propria, the operation must be performed in a different manner, the parts requiring to be rather fully exposed; and indeed, if the tumour be of any considerable magnitude, even though the sac be not opened, it will be better to expose the part somewhat more freely in the way to be described. An incision should be made parallel to Poupart’s ligament, by pinching up the skin, and then a transverse cut from the centre of this canded over the tumoiu’ so ns to present the follovung shape V : the dissection must then be carried through the superficial fascia, when the septum crurale or fascia propria vnll be exposed ; in some liases, especially if the hernia be a large one, this is thin, and requires to he carefully slit up on a director. In many instances, however, it is so dense, laminated, and changed in structure, as scarcely to be recognised for what it is.SPECIAL IlERNI.E. 672 It not unfrcquently happens that, after the superficial fascia has been divided, an oval, smooth, and firm body is exposed, -which at first looks like the hernial sac, or a lump of omentum ; this is in reality the fascia propria, thickened by the long-continued pressure of the truss, and congested perhaps by the attempts at reduction ; and in the midst of it, the sac will at last be found, after the dissection has been can-ied through several layers of this tissue. In it cysts containing bloody scrum may occasionally be found, and then the difficulty in the recognition of the structures is greatly increased. Though the mobility of this mass, the facihty of tracing its neck, and the roundness of its general outline, often cause it to be mistaken for sac or omentum, it may he distinguished from the first by the absence of the characteristic vessels upon its surface, and from the second by its more rounded, solid feel, and uniform, appearance. When the sac has been reached, it must be very carefully opened, there being usually very little if any fluid between it and its contents ; the^ finger-nail must then be passed under the sharp edge of the stricture, which should be divided in a direction upwards and inwards. The reason why this line of incision is universally chosen by Surgeons in this country at the present, day, is, that it is the only direction in which the strictiu’e can be divided without risk of inflicting serious injm-y upon neighbouring parts. If the section be made outwards, the femoral vein wiU be in danger ; if upwards and out- wards, the epigastric artery ; if directly upwards, the spermatic cord : hence the only direction is either inwards, or upwards and inwards. If the cut be made inwards, the sharp edge of Gimbernat’s ligament alone will be divided, and the crural arch not sufficiently hberated. But if the division be made upwards and inwards, the ilio-femoral ligament will be divided, and thus the tension of the whole of the arch lessened; the only danger that can occur from the division of the strictiue in this direction is the very remote one of the division of the obtiuator artery, when it takes the anomalous coui'se round the inside of the neck of the sac. Guthrie states that he has known some of the best Siugeons in London to lose patients by haemorrhage after the operation for femoral hernia. This accident, however, must be of extremely rare occun-ence, and might in a great measiue be guarded against by slightly blunting the edge of the hernia-knife before dividing the stricture, so that the tense fibrous bands, constituting the constriction would yield, while the artery would probably escape, being pushed before the biunted edge. I have, however, more than once seen blood well up rather freely on the division of the stricture; but it has ceased spontaneously, and I have never kno-wn it to give any trouble. If the division of the stricture be limited to a line or two, there will be but little danger of wounding the vessel, even when it takes the abnormal A^case in which this accident happened is recorded by A. H. Corley, of the Jervis Street Hospital, in Dublin. The bleeding was vei-y free, but was easily controlled by passing the fore finger into the wound and grasping the abdominal waU between it and the thumb. A emwed needle was accordingly passed in through the ring and out immediately above Poupart s hgament an a twisted suture applied round it.

The two ends Imd retracted one inch apart, the distal having gone so far in the direction of the obtnrator foramen that any attempt to reach it would have been out of the question. The needle was found to have passed imme- diately in front of the proximal end, crossing the track of the artery, but not actually including it within the ligature ; yet the traction so exerted seems to have been enough to close the vessel, as it was obliterated by a clot. The distal end contained no clot. From this case, it is evident that acupressure is the most hopeful means of dealing with such an accident, but it can only lie applied to the proximal end. In this case no htemorrhage occurred from the distal end, but the patient was much exhausted, and lived only thirty hours after the operation. It will generally be found that the intestine contained in the sac of a femoral hernia is dark-colomed and tightly nipped; it requires to be treated in accord- ance with the general principles that guide us in the management of hernia. UMBILICAL HERNIA. By Umbilical Hernia or Exoniphalus is meant a protrusion through the umbilical aperture. It occurs either in children or in adults. Umbilical Hernia in Children is sometimes congenital; and, when so, it has happened that the protrusion has been included in, and accidentally strangulated by, the hgatiu'e applied to the umbiheal cord. More frequently, however, it ocems shortly after birth, in consequence of the child straining or crying. In these cases it is readily recognised by a smooth, rounded, and tense tumour, starting forwards at the umbilicus, readily reducible on pressure. The Treatment should consist in keeping the tumour reduced by the appli- cation of an elastic India-rubber belt, with an air-pad that presses firmly upon the aperture; or, should such a contrivance as this not be at hand, the reduction may readily enough be effected by applying over the aperture a piece of soap-plaster spread on amadou, upon which a weU-padded slice of cork may be tightly strapped. It most commonly happens that, after pressure has in this way been kept up for some months, a radical cure results. Umbilical Hernia in Adults most frequently occurs in women, espe- cially those who have home many children, or who are loaded with internal fat. It is by no means unlikely that a tendency to this disease is often estab- lished in childhood, but does not become developed until the abdominal muscles have been weakened and the umbiheal aperture relaxed by the pressure of the gravid uterus. Umbilical rupture generally attains a considerable bulk, and often acqubes an enormous size ; when large, it is commonly iiTegular or semilunar in shape, sometimes appearing to be composed of several distinct tiunours. It is usually partly doughy and partly tympanitic to the feel, has a distinct impulse on coughing, and is readily reducible ; not unfrequently it happens, however, that a portion of the rupture continues irreducible, owing to the existence of adherent omentum. The coverings of an umbilical rupture are usuaUy ex- tremely thin, consisting merely of the peritonemn, a layer of condensed fascia, which IS often perforated at several points by circular openings through which the heraia protrudes, and the integuments containing the umbilical cicatrix, i> h,ch 18 ex-panded over the part. The sac gener.ally contains both intestine T OL. II, X X674 SPECIAL IIERNIJE. and omentum, but the stomach and other viscera have been included in it • and Murray has recorded a case in which the gravid uterus, at the eightli month of pregnancy, formed the contents of an umbilical hernia. Treatment.—The treatment consists, if the hernia be reducible, in wearinf>- a properly constructed truss ; if irreducible, in applying a hollow cup-shaped pad supported by a bandage over the part. It not unfrequently happens that, in consequence of an indigestible or flatulent meal, an irreducible umbilical rupture in old persons becomes obstructed, the symptoms consisting of tension of the protrusion, with nausea and constipation. In these cases, much dis- crimination will be required to avoid confounding this passive condition of the tumour mth acute strangulation of it. This may be done by attention to the rules laid down (p. G29, vol. II.). By leeching, fomentations, calomel and opium, and enemata, relief may usually be afforded. Should, however, the bowels not speedily act, and stercoraceous vomiting come on, the tumom’ con- tinuing irreducible, it will be better to cut doMm upon it, and treat it as a strangulated hernia, dividing adhesions, and reducing the swelling ; for, if it be left obstructed and unreduced, the whole tumour may run into a state of gangrenous inflammation, and then operative interference will be of httle use. In such circumstances death usually results ; but I have known the patient to survive the gangrene, the whole of a coil of intestine, the sac, and much mesentery and omentum sloughing away, and an incm’able artificial anus resulting. When an umbilical hernia becomes strangulated, as often happens in old iiTeducible tumours of this description, the symptoms are not usually very acute at first; but no time should be lost in eifecting reduction, if possible, by the taxis, as they speedily assume an active and urgent character. If the taxis fail, the plan that I have usually found to succeed best has been to give the patient three doses of calomel gr. ij, and opium gr. j, one every second hour ; at the administration of the second dose to apply an ice-bladder ; to keep this on for four horn’s ; and then to employ the taxis again, when reduction of some portion of the swelling will rarely fail to occur. Should this not succeed, the operation must be proceeded with without further delay, lest gangrene of the timiour set in. Operation.—The parts covering an umbilical hernia are usually very thin in places, so that much caution is required in making the early incisions. The strictm’e shoidd, if possible, be divided without opening the sac. This may usually be accomplished by drawing the tumour well down, and then making an incision in it about two inches in length over the neck at its upper part in the mesial hne. If the tumour OA'erlap here, it may be more convenient to make the incision by the side of the umbilical cicatrix, or even between the two lobes of the tumour ; but as a general rule, the upper part is the best. After the dmsion of the integumental structm’es, and often of a deep layer of fat, the end of the nail may be slipped under the edge of the sharp circular margin through which the ]3rotrusion has occurred, and, the stricture being divided away from the sac, and if possible in the mesial line, reduction may be readily and safely accomplished. Should the strangulation not be thus relieved, the sac must be opened, and any stricture di\dded from within. But the Surgeon should exhaust every means before he opens the sac of an675 VENTRAL UERNIA. ^imbilical lieruia, especially of large size, tlie patient, I believe, rare y le- coverino- when tins is done—much less frequently, so far as my experience troes than in other forms of hernia. Sometimes, after the external division of the stricture, it will be found that there is an internal strangiJation in the hernia, the gut having slipped tlmough an aperture formed, I believe, in the condensed fascia covering the sac ; if so, the edge of this sharply defined cpeiiino- may require division. Sir A. Cooper mentions an umbilical hernia formiiur two tumours, having a communication between them ; and South xelates a case in ivliich the tumom- resembled a figure of 8, a dense areolar baud binding down the middle of the sac. In such cases as these, which are by no means”uncommon, central constrietion may require to be divided as well 5is the stricture at the neck of the sac. Adherent omentum had, I think, better be left in the sac in cases of umbilical hernia ; and gangrenous intestine or omentum must be treated upon general principles. It is not often that strangulation of an umbilical hernia occims during pregnancy ; but, should this happen, the operation must be performed as usual; that condition does not complicate the case much, and instances are recorded by Sir A. Cooper, Lawrence, and others, of its successful performance at this period. After the division of the strietures and the reduction of parts, a large and very thick •compress must be laid over the loose folds of integument in the site of the hernia, and be retained in position by a broad and firmly applied flannel roller. VENTKAIi HEBNIA. By Ventral Herniae are meant those protrusions of the intestine that occur through any part of the abdominal wall, except the inguinal, the femoral, or the imibihcal apertm’es ; they most commonly occur in the mid-line between the recti muscles, the linea alba appearing to have given way in this situation dining parturition ; and here they may attain an immense size. A case was once sent to me from the country, in which there was a long triangular gap through the upper part of the abdominal wall, extending from the umbilicus to the eusiform cartilage, through which a protrusion had taken place that was nearly as large as an adult’s head. These ruptines have also been met with in the linem semilunares, and in the hypoehondriae and iliae regions ; and Cloquet describes a case oceurring in the lumbar region. When these hernim happen in the vicinity of the stomach, they are apt to occasion dyspeptic symptoms and much gastric irritation ; but Lawrence is doubtless right in thinking that these symptoms do not arise from the implication of the stomach, but simply from in-itation of it. These difierent protrusions have occasionally been met with as the residt of injuries, by which the anterior abdominal waU has been lacerated ; indeed they seldom, if ever, take place below the umbilicus, unless arising fr-om a directly traumatic cause. Treatment.—The treatment of ventral hernia must consist in supporting the tumour by means of a broad belt and properly constructed pad. Should it become strangulated, which I believe very rarely happens, owing to the width of the neck of the sac, the operation must be performed in the same way as for umbilical rupture, care being taken to divide cautiously the integuments, any aponeurotic investments, and the peritoneal sac if necessary; the stricture should always be divided upwards in the mesial line. X X 2SPECIAL IIERNIjE. 676 * A rare kind of ventral rapture has been dcscrn)ed by (Intbrie and tbe- German Surgeons, in which the abdominal wall has been absorbed or yielded to a considerable extent, forming a broad and expanded tumour, without any distinct neck 01 pedicle. Sometimes this tumour may attain an immense size stretching perhaps doAvn to the knees, and containing even the gravid uterus PELVIC HERNLB. Obturator Hernia.—This rare foimi of hernia, in ivhich the protrasion of intestine takes place through the thyroid foramen, was first noticed by Garengeot, in the early part of the eighteenth century ; and, since that time, about seventy cases have been recorded. Its existence has rarely been ascertained till after death ; in fact, Lawrence seems to doubt the possibility of the recognition of the complaint during life, in consequence of the small size wLich the tumour attains, and its being covered in and compressed under the pectineus muscle. But several cases are on record in which it was recognised during life. It generally occurs in persons above the age of fifty ; in consequence, according to Gurlt, of the participation by the muscular structines passing through the thyroid foramen in the general wasting of tissue which occurs at that time of life. Sym,2}foms.—In obturator hernia, the intestine descends through the thyroid foramen ; the neck of the sac thus lies behind the horizontal ramus of the pubes. The symptoms have in some cases sufficiently resembled those of strangulated femoral hernia to lead able Surgeons to suppose they had to deal ivith the latter affection. In addition, however, to the ordinary symptoms of strangulation, there arc two special signs which may lead to the suspicion of the existence of this hernia, if not to its positive diagnosis. The first of these is a slight fulness and hardness in the upper part of the thigh to the inner side of the femoral vessels, often very indistinct, yet giving to the surface of the limb a different outline from that which is observed on the other side. The other is, pain extending down the inner side of the thigh towards the knee ,- or even, as in a case referred to by Birkett, as far as the great toe. This pain has been noticed in a large number of the recorded cases, and is due to the pressure of the hernia on the obturator nerve : it may also be increased by pressure with the hand at the thyi’oid foramen. It does not extend to the testis ; but it may, as happened in a case which I have seen, affect the thigh to such an extent that the patient, to relieve it, flexes the limb on the abdomen. Eoser has recommended, as a means of diagnosis, an examination of the interior of the pelvis, per rectum in the male, and jier vaginam in the female. Most reliance, however, is to be placed on the symptoms which I have described. Treatment.—The taxis has been employed in a few cases. In one instance, Edscr reduced an obturator hernia in this way, the patient surviving ; but, in another case under his care, death took place, a portion of the walls of the in- ■ testine remaining strangulated. Werner w'as successful in an instance in f which, in addition to applying pressure externally, he introduced his hand into the vagina, and employed traction backwards and upwards. Welsch of Herren- berg reduced an obturator heraia by external pressure ; the patient was ap- parently doing well, when, in a few days, an abscess appeared at the site of the hernia, and he died in seven weeks. At the post mortem examination, the end677 TREATMENT OF OBTURATOR HERNIA. of the vermiform appendix atos found projecting through the thyroid foramen, with its tip laid open by the suiipirrativc process. In ten cases, an operation lias been performed, followed in three cases by .'•ocovcTy, and in seven by death. The recoveries occiuTcd in the practice of ObreS Bransby Cooper, and Lorinser of Vienna ; and the deaths in cases operated on by Heath of Ncwcastle-on-Tyne, Nuttall of Leicester, Heiberg <and Zahrtmann, Ariitz of llingkjdbing, Uh-ich and "Wilms of Berlin (two oases). In Obre’s case, the patient was seized with symptoms of strangulation, but no tumour could be detected in any of the ordinary seats of hernia. “ On uncovering the upper part of both thighs at the same time, the eye detected a slight degree of fulness in Scarpa’s triangle on the right side ; this triangle of the opposite limb ivas well marked with a hollow, or depression passing down its centre, but this was lost on the affected side, and the w'^hole contour of this part of the limb was visibly fuller than that of the corresponding one. There was no tumour or circumscribed swelling ; but, on standing over the patient, 4ind using firm pressiu’e with the ends of the fingers over the neighboiu’hood of the femoral artery, and a little below the saphenous opening, a distinct hard- ness could be felt (slight in its extent), giving an impression as if the sheaths of the vessels were being pressed on.” Taking the dangerous state of the patient into consideration, Obre acted in accordance with the best rules of surgery ; ^ind, thinking that there might be a hernia deeply strangulated in the femoral •canal, he made an incision downwards in this situation, but was disappointed •on finding, when the saphenous opening was exposed, that there was no in- testine confined there. As, however, a hardened structure could be deeply felt •at the inner border of the opening, the fascia lata was exposed, and the pectineus muscle divided to the extent of about two inches, when a hernial sac of about the size of a pigeon’s egg, and containing intestine, came into view. In this operation the saphena vein gave some trouble, lying in the course of the in- ■cision. The sac having been laid open, the stricture was dividedj_upwards, ■during which part of the procedure the vein was accidentally cut, and required ligature ; no other vessel was tied. The operation, which reflects the greatest •credit on Obr^’s diagnostic skill and dexterity, was perfectly successful, the patient making an excellent recovery. In Bransby Cooper’s case, the patient, •a woman aged forty-nine, recovered from the operation, but died of bronchitis before leaving the hospital. In Lorinser’s case, the existence of the tiunour was detected by vaginal examination. On cutting down on the hernia (on the •eleventh day of the symptoms) the intestine was found gangrenous. A fmcal fistula resulted, but subsequently closed ; and the patient survived eleven months, dying at last of tuberculosis. Considering the results which have followed the operation for obturator hernia, I think that when, in addition to the ordinary signs of strangulation, ■there are also present the altered contour of the limb (perhaps even distinct local swelling) and the pain which have been above described, these symptoms not only justify, but demand, that an exploratory incision be made through ■the stiuctures overlying the obturator foramen so as to examine it. If a hernia be found there, it must be dealt with by the general rules ah'eady laid down, according to the state of the intestine. Besides the obturator, various other pelvic hernim may take place, as into the6^S SPECIAL IIERNTjE. pcriniBiun, the vagina, or through the sciatic notch. Tliesc various forms of Tuptm-e arc of extreme rarity, and present many difficulties in their diagnosis. Perineal Hernia commonly occurs in the middle line, between the- rectum and the bladder in men, or the rectum and vagina in women ; but sometimes the protrusion has been known to take place by the side of the anus, or even in front of this. Of these vax’ious forms of rupture, many in- stances have been collected by Lawrence from different writers. The Treat- ment of such a hernia would consist in supporting the protrusion by means of a pad and bandage ; as the mouth of the sac is very large, strangulation is. not probable. Vaginal Hernia has occasionally been met with ; the tumour protruding- through the posterior or upper wall of the vag-ina, and presenting the ordinary characters of this disease, such as impulse on coughing and reducibility. It. may most conveniently be kept up by means of a sponge pessary. Pudendal Hernia has been described by Sir A. Cooper as very closely j resembling vaginal rupture. The situation of the tumoiu’ may cause it to be- j mistaken for an inguinal hernia ; but from this it may be recognised by the- ' upper part of the labium and the ring being completely free, whilst a tumom' presenting the ordinary characters of a ruptm-e is situated in the lower part of the labium, and forms a prominence along the side of the vagina. Sciatic Hernia.—This rare form of hernia has been described by Sir A. Cooper as passing through the sciatic notch, where it lies between the lower border of the pyriform muscle and the spine of the ischium. It hes in close relation with the sciatic nerve, and with the internal ihac vessels. In the: case related by Cooper, the obturator arteiy passed above, and the vein below the neck of the sac. From the depth at which such a hernia would be seated,, and its small size, it would probably escape observation durmg life ; but, if detected, it might readily be retained by means of proper bandages and a pad. Should operation ever be required, the deep incisions must be carefoUy con- ducted, on account of the great importance of the parts surrounding the sac. DIAPHRAGMATIC HERNIA. Congenital defect of the Diaphragm is occasionally met with.'^ It has consisted, in most of the recorded cases, of an aperture in this membrane,, varying in size from an inch in diameter upwards; and even, in some rare- instances, of an entire absence of one or both wings of the diaphragm. Through these openings, the contents of the abdomen have been protruded the stomach and small intestines being most frequently displaced, and the- spleen and hver having been found in the chest in a tolerably lai-ge proportion of the cases. The hernia has been mostly observed in children at or soon after bii'th ; but in several instances the subjects have hved to adult age, the- hemia-at last apparently taking place accidentally. In some of these latter ■ cases, liOTveyer, it maybe a question whether the opening in the diapiiagni Avas not the result of an accident, perhaps some time antecedent to the occiu- rence of the hernia. The opening has generally been found in the left sic e ; sometimes, however, on the right. * A most complete and interesting account of Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia n-as published hy Dr. Tholuas Balfour in the Ediiiburgh Medical Journal^ for Apiil, looj.DIA PUR A GJ/A TIC HERNIA. 679 1 Diaphragmatic heniia is sometimes obviously of traumatic origin, being the result of a vound or laceration of the diaphragm. It usually attains a lar<>-e size, and commonly contains the stomach or the transverse colon with a portion of the omentum, which forms a tumour in the thoracic cavity, encroaching upon the lungs, and pushing the heart to one side. The hernia is not enclosed in a peritoneal sac, but has been found partially enveloped by the pleiura. It occurs generally on the left side of the chest, but cases have been reeorded by Percy and others where the injury of the diaphragm was on the right side. The following ease affords a very good instance of this rare affection. A man, seventy-four years of age, was admitted into University College Hospital. About twelve months before, he fell into an area about ten feet deep; he believed that he injiued his chest and head, as from that time he had suffered much from shortness of breath and occasional sensation of suffo- cation, had a hacking cough, and could not lie domi without feeling some difficulty in breathing. At the time of the accident, he coughed up about three spoonfuls of blood. Ever since the accident, he suffered much from dyspeptic symptoms and constipation, though before he met with the injury he had experienced no inconvenience in this respect. About a month before admission, the difficulty in breathing increased ; and four days before he came to the hospital, Uolent pain in the abdomen came on, and his bowels ceased to act, although he took a variety of aperient medicines, and had enemata contain- ing croton oil. On admission, the abdomen was much distended, tense, and tympanitic, with pain around the umbilicus; the tongue was coated with whitish-brown, moist fur ; the pulse was small, quick, and somewhat resisting; there was nausea, but no vomiting. The skin was cool, and the countenance anxious ; the bowels had not acted for seven days, but he had frequent desire to go to stool. He Avas ordered an aperient draught every third hoiu\ As this had no effect, he Avas directed to take calomel and elaterium piUs, and to, have turpentine enemata, Avhich afforded him some reh'ef, though they brought away no faeces. The patient became more restless, the skin cold and flabby, the countenance more anxious, the breathing shorter, and the abdomen more tympanitic, and he died tAvo days after admission, and nine from the commence- ment of the obstruction.

Intestinal Obstructions may be of two distinct kinds, tbe Acute and the Chronic. These must not be confounded with one another, as they arc usually dependent not only upon very difi’erent conditions, but require different linos of treatment to be adopted for their rehef. Acute Intestinal Obstruction.—This condition may arise from liNc different causes. 1. It most commonly occurs by the formation of an internal hernia, which becomes suddenly strangulated, a portion of gut slipping through un apertiu'e in the mesentery or omentum (Fig. (J90), or becoming constricted by bands, adhesions, or di^•erticula, stretching across from one side of the ubdomen to the other. 2. It may occur from invagination or intussusception, the iqiper portion of the intestine slipping into and being constricted by the lower. 3. It may be produced by a portion of gut becoming twisted upon itself, and thus forming a volvulus, owing to the mesentery or meso-colon being unusually long, and allowing a half twist to take place, in consequence of %vhich complete obstruction ocem’s. 4. In other instances, symptoms of acute obstruction may arise in consequence of a mab'gnant stricture gradually closing, and then at last becoming suddenly occluded. 5. Severe and even fatal intestinal obstruction may occur simply from a spasmodic con- traction of the intestine, or as the result of inflammatory affections of the abdomen, without the existence of any mechanical lesion. Symptoms.—The symptoms of acute intestinal obstruction, more especially when arising from a mechanical cause, such as the forma- tion of an internal hernia, or volvu- lus, are always characterised by "very mjirked vital depression. There is constipation from the very first; but tin’s symptom is not the most prominent one, and those that result arc evidently, as in an ordinary case of strangulated hernia, the consequence of the injimy inflicted upon the intestine, rather than of tlie mere mechanical obstacle to the onward passage of the fasces. At the moment of the occurrence of the Fig. 000.—Intcstiniil Olistruotion from Ijitcnin Hernia.682 INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION. strangulation, the patient is usually seized with a sudden feeling of something 'UTong having taken place in the abdomen ; or he is struck with intense pain at one point. There may be sudden syncope, though most usually the depression of vital power docs not amount to this. Vomiting speedily occurs ; at first of the contents of the stomach, but after a time of stercoraceous matter ; some- times it assumes this form almost from the very first. The abdomen becomes swollen and tender, the intestines being blown up with flatus, giving rise to immense tympanitic distension, rolling over one another, and occasioning loud rumbling and gurgling noises. If the abdominal walls be thin, the rolling of the intestines may be distinctly felt, and in many cases seen, through them: and may sometimes be observed to be continued up to one spot, where it ceases. At this point an intumescence may sometimes be indistinctly felt correspond- ing to the seat of strangulation. If relief be not afforded, the sufferings of the patient become very severe, and his mental distress agonising ; the vomiting, perhaps, become less frequent, but the vital depression increases, and at last death results, usually about the sixth to the tenth day, though sometimes sooner, from exhaustion, peritonitis, and gangrene conjoined, the mind being- clear to the last, and the patient’s attention being intently and distressingly riveted upon the possibility or not of getting relief from the bowels. Chronic Intestinal Obstruction.—This usually arises from one of three causes ; viz., 1, the gradual obliteration of some portion of the colon, in con- sequence of the malignant degeneration of its walls ; 2, the compression of the gut by a tumour growing near it ; or, 3, the obstruction of its cavity by the accumulation of large masses of hardened feculent matters. The Symptoms, in the earlier stages of these cases, are commonly those that will be described as indicating stricture of the large intestine ; but, when once complete obstruction has come on, the constipation becomes the most pro- minent symptom. In some instances, this wdU occur without any antecedent leading to the supposition of the existence of stricture. There may be compa- ratively httle constitutional disturbance at first, but the bowels cannot be made to act, and any attempt at forcing their operation by the administration of pm’gatives gives rise to sickness and much distress. Diu’ing the progress of the- attack, eructations, retchings, and even vomiting, are of firequent occm-rence, but it seldom happens that this is stercoraceous till the very last; there may be much tympanites, with rumbling and gurgling of the intestines, but most- frequently the abdomen fills slowly and gradually, and these symptoms do not occur until after some days have elapsed. The distress of the patient does not depend so much on the length of time that the obstruction has existed, as on the amount of tympanitic distension of the abdomen. The greater this is, the more m-gent wiU be the symptoms. In many instances, life is prolonged for several weeks, for five or six, even after complete obstruction has set m; and in some cases a recovery may take place, even though a very considerable time have elapsed from the occurrence of the obstruction. In the case of a lady ' whom I attended many years ago with Mr. Powell, recovery took place, although there had been complete obstruction for upwards of five weeks ; and I have seen other cases recover in which from forty to forty-five days had elapsed before the obstruction was reheved. Diagnosis.—I. The diagnosis of the cames of the obstruction is of greatSYMPTOMS OF ACUTE OBSTRUCTION. 68s importance ; attention as to Avhether it assumes the acute or the chrome fornv will throw some light upon the conditions that occasion it. It is often difficult, to determine whether the obstruction is mechanical, or whether it depends, upon a spasmodic or inflammatory affection of the intestine, fihe piactice to- be adopted in any particular case must at last be determined by a history of the symptoms, by a careful exploration of the abdomen and rectum, and by the.- light that can thus be thrown upon the question, as to whether the obstruction be dependent on causes that ai-e removable or not by medical means. In many instances, the history of the case, the assemblage of strongly marked symptoms,, and the residt of abdominal and rectal exploration, enable the Surgeon to deter- mine, without much difficulty, that the obstruction is dependent on causes that, are not removable by any means short of operative interference. But, in othex" cases, no moans that we possess enable us to anive at a coiTCct or even an approximate diagnosis. Cases are recorded that have ended fatally from obstruction in forty-eight hours, without sickness, fixed pain in the abdomen,, or tympanites. These, however, are certainly exceptional, and do not bear" upon the question as to the propriety of performing gastrotomy in those in- stances in which it can be satisfactorily determined that a mechanical obstacle,, not removable by medical means, exists. That the diagnosis may so far be- effected vdth tolerable certainty is evident, from the fact that, in all those: cases of gastrotomy which have been of late years practised in this country,, mechanical obstruction, iiTemox'able by any but operative interference, had. Ixeen diagnosed and was found. The symptoms that vdll chiefly engage the Surgeon’s attention are—1, the- Dm’ation of the Constipation ; 2, the Occurrence of fixed Local Pain in the. Abdomen ; and 3, the Character of the Yomited Matters. 1. The Duration of the Constipation does not necessarily throw much light upon the cause. Indeed, if patients be naturally costive, constipation may last for a considerable number of days, or even weeks, without producing any very serioixs consequences. Most practitioners mxist have seen cases in which constipation has continued for three or four weeks, without destroying th& patient. Johnson mentions a case, in which it lasted during forty-five days.. In these cases, howevei’, constipation has usually come on gradually, being, as. it were, an aggravation of the patient’s natural condition. It is the character I’ather than the mei’e duration of the constipation that is important. The: sudden occmi’ence of iiTemovable obstruction, both of flatus and feces, ii\ pei’sons otherwise regular in their bow-els, and the sense of its dependence on a fixed cause, are points of importance, as tending to show that it arises from an acute mechanical condition. In acute internal strangidation, the constipation IS a ways sudden, and is accompanied or speedily followed by other symptoms, mdicating obstruction. 2. The Occurrence of Fixed Pain is common to many conditions of the: when taken in conjunction with the sudden supervention 0 o s luction to the course of the feces, with more or less tumefaction corres- ponch^ng to the seat of pain, and more especially with the next symptom ta which I shall advert, it is not without much value in the diagnosis. 3 Character of the Vomiting.—Even when the obstruction is not depen- dent on complete mechanical occlusion of the bowel, there may be incessant1 684 INTEBTINA L OESTJi UGTl OX. \'omitiug, and tUo stomach may reject its contents as often as anything is in- troduced into it ; but the vomiting will not be feculent in the majority of ■cases, however obstinate the constipation may be, and however long it may last. It, however, there be complete meehanical occlusion, feculent vomiting anost commonly sets in early, frequently by the third day, or even sooner ; and will continue until the cause of occlusion bci’cinoved. The vomiting, however, is not continuous, but will usually occur only after food has been taken into ■the stomach. It is true that feculent vomiting is not sufficient by itself to de- •termine the diagnosis ; and that it may occur in cases of pure spasmodic ileus, in which the obstruction is removable by medical means. Of this I have seen several instances,—the feculent vomiting being very persistent, and the patient presenting all the othei’ symptoms that are usually considered to be dependent on internal strangulation ; but eventually recovering under the use of opium, and other medical means directed to the relief of spasm, without •the necessity of operative interference. It is, therefore, as necessary to bear in mind the occasional dependence of feculent vomiting on pure spasmodic ileus, •or on other conditions that are removable by medical aid alone, as that it may be absent in cases in which the obstruction, Avhether seated in the small or in the large intestine, can only be relieved by surgical assistance. But a careful ■exploration of the abdomen and rectum, and a proper inquiry into the history •of the case, will most generally prevent the Singeon from being led into any serious error by trusting too implicitly to the presence or absence of this one symptom. The following is a summary of the general diagnostic signs of the various ■conditions, leading to acute internal obstruetion. 1. In Internal hernia the suddenness of the symptoms, the prostration or even syncope, fixed pain, ■and Ammiting, will throw light on the condition. '1. In Inhissuscejjtion, the early age, the fixed pain, with elongated tumour to be felt on palpation, and possibly through the rectum, Avith bloody mucous stools and tenesmus, are the chief signs. 3. In Volvuhts the signs of internal strangulation, Avith A-ery imequal distension of the abdomen, great tympanites on one side and flattening cn the other, are met with. 4. In Chronic stricture suddenly occluded, the .sudden aggraAction of the previous long-continued difficulty in defecation will clear up the diagnosis. II. After determining Avhether the obstruction be dependent on causes that are remoAmble or not, the next most important point is doubtless to asceitain Avhether the obstruction is seated in the laxge or in the small intestine. In general, there may be no great diflficulty in coming to an accurate opinion on this point, if it be borne in mind that, Avith the exception of a ohmlus, obstructions of the large intestines are most generally chronic, Avhilst those of the small ai-e, in by far the majority of cases if not invanably, acute in their character. The earlier occm-rence of feculent vomiting Avhen the obstruction is in the smaU intestine, the greater tympanitic distention and bulging in the com’se of the emeum and colon Avhen it is seated in the laige mtestnie ( e amount of minary secretion being, as was pointed out by Hilton and te. hir , less in the former than in the latter case, OAving to the diminis e , intestinal surface capable of absorption of liquids), and the result of ^ai exploration of tlie rectum, will most commonly enable the Surgeon to clecid685 SEAT OF OBSTRUCTION. this question with sufficient precision to guide him in tne choice of an operation. Yet cases do occur in which, tliough the obstruction be seated m the largm intestine, the symptoms are aeuto, and evidently not dependent on ctronm obstructive disease, and vomiting is of early occurrence, the distension of the- abdomen slight, the exploration by the rectum yields no result; and it is in cases of this description, presenting a train of symptoms of mixed and' uncertain character, that the diagnosis of the precise seat of the obstructioiii cannot be made with sufficient precision to justify operation. The most important point to determine in reference to the relief of intestinal’ obstructions by surgical operation, is whether the seat of the occlusion be above or below' the lower end of the descending colon. If situated at or below this, relief may be afforded by “ Amussat’s operation,” by which the colon is opened behind, and not through, the peritoneum. If above this point, except in those very rare cases in which the obstruction is in the transverse colon, it will be necessary to do “ Gastrotomy,” an operation by which the peritoneal cavity is. opened, and thus the peril to the patient greatly increased. 1. When the obstruction is situated below the descending colon, explora- tion of the rectum wffil usually determine to what cause it is more immediately referable. Thus it may be owing to fiecal impaction ; to strangulation of in- ternal piles ; to compression of the rectum by an over-distended bladder ; or to an enlarged uterus, engorged and tilted backw'ards so as to compress and constrict the gut, and thus to lead to the supposition of the existence of tumoiu'. If the intestinal obstruction be owing to one or the other of these causes, it may readily be relieved by appropriate treatment. It, however, more commonly proceeds from other conditions in this situation, that do not admit of relief except by oyierative interference ; as from constriction, simple or malignant, of the upper portion of the rectum, or of the lower part of the sigmoid flexure of the colon, produced by the pressure of a peh-ic tumour, or by a stricture from flbrous or cancerous degeneration of this part of the wall of the gut. In these circumstances, the obstruction may be as complete as in a case of internal strangulation, and the patient will inevitably perish unless relieved by operation. It is in this group of cases that relief may be given without intei'fering with the cavity of the peritoneum, by the operation of opening the descending colon in the left, or the emeum in the right lumbar region, between the reflections of the peritoneum at the part where the gut is not covered by that membrane. 2. When the obstruction is situated above the descending colon, it almost always occurs in the small intestine, rarely in the cincum or transverse colon,, and may be dependent on various causes, some of wffiich are removable, and others not, and of which preparations may be found in all the large patho- logical collections in London. Thus, it may be the result of internal strangu- lation, either occasioned by the small intestine falling into a pouch formed by the mesentery, or by the constriction of the gut by the passage across it of adventitious fibrous bands. It may be occasioned by intussusception, by the lodgment of biliaiy or other similar concretions, or by mere spasm of the smalt intestine, which may be so persistent as to prove fatal. This is, doubtless, a rare occun-ence; but cases of the kind arc on record, in -which the only post viortem appearance that could be discovered has been a spasmodicallyINTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION. <586 •contracted ileum. The great practical difficulty in all those cases of obstruc- tion, above the sigmoid flexure of the colon, is to determine the cause of the obstruction, whether it be of such a nature as may be removed by operation or not. In some of the cases mentioned, there may be special symptoms, Avhich lead to a tolerably direct diagnosis. Thus, in intussusception, bloody and mucous stools, and the existence of an oblong indurated swelling, may give a clue ; and in children, as the intussusception usually takes place through the ileo-colic valve, the mass of prolapsed intestine may often be felt in the rectum. In malignant or fibrous degeneration of the colon, the chronic nature of the •disease, the history of the case, and rectal exploration with the bougie, may indicate the nature of the obstructing cause. Treatment.—Treatment of Acute Obstruction.—This must necessarily l)e in a great measure determined by the diagnosis that is made as to its cause. Before proceeding to the employment of any measures, whether medical or surgical, in these cases, the Surgeon should never omit to institute a careful examination of the various abdominal and pelvic apertures for some of the more obscure forms of external hernia ; for in cases of supposed internal strangulation, it has occasionally timned out, after death, that the patient had been labouring under a small femoral, obtiwator, or sciatic hernia. If such a eondition be detected, it must of course be relieved by proper operative means. In the event of no such protrusion being detected, and from the general •obscurity of the symptoms in these cases rendering an exact diagnosis in the earlier stages almost impossible, it is generally expedient to try the effect of proper medical treatment, which will sometimes, even in apparently hopeless cases, afford relief. The only plan of treatment that appears to me of any value is the continued administration of opium or of calomel and opium, with the free application of leeches to the abdomen, followed by fomentations. The opium should be given in the solid form, the dose being one grain every six or eight bours, either alone or combined with half a grain to a grain of calomel. This treatment will in all cases be of considerable service, and in some, even the most hopeless and complicated, will afford satisfactory results. In a very complicated case of intestinal obstruction which I attended mth Garrod, this plan was eminently successful. A patient Avas admitted into the Hospital, haAing symptoms of internal strangulation ; he had at the same time double inguinal hernia, and a small umbilical rupture, as well as the remains of a fatty tumour, which had been partially removed from the abdomimal wall many years previously. There were peritonitis Avith tympanites, steicoraceous vomiting, and much vital depression ; but, as there was no strangulation existing in any of the external hernim, and as there Avas no evidence as to the precise locality of the internal mischief, it was not thought advisable to haverecoiu'se to opera- tion. The patient aatts accordingly treated Avith calomel and opium, when, on the tenth day, the obstruction gave way and the bowels acted, the patient ultimately recovering. n • • ^ Inflation of the Obstructed Intestine, by the injection of air into the rectum, has been recommended in cases of intussusception, and has occasionally been practised with success. In two instances I have successfully had recourse to it. One was the case of an infant, a few months old, seized with symptoms of intussusceptmn, whom I attended with Cousins. The other patient was aOPERATION' FOR ACUTE OBSTRUCTION. 687 Toun- lady about ten years of age, to whom I was called into consultation amth kr T. AVaion, Dr. Murphy, and Dr. West; inflation was performed on the fifth day after the setting in of sjanptouis of acute intestinal obstiiiction ap- parently dependent on intussusception. The proceeding uas followed by perfect success : the child felt “as if a bone broke ” in the abdomen the ob- struction was removed, and motions followed in three hours though all the previous treatment had been unavailing. For the convenient perfoimance of this operation, I have had an apparatus constructed, consisting of a circular double-action belloivs, with a long Aulcanised India-rubber tube, furnished with a stop-cock and rectum-tubes of different sizes for children and adults. Should this not bo at hand, a well-fitted stomach-pump will answer the pui-pose. AWieii the air is pumped in, it is doubtful whether it passes beyond the ileo- cmcal A-alve ; but this is of little consequence, in children especially, in whom the inflation of the large intestine alone may be quite sufficient, the obstruction often consisting of the slipping of the portion of the small intestine through the ileo-caecal aperture. Inversion of the patient, and shaking him violently when in this position, is an empirical method of treatment that has occasionally proved successful in the relief of cases of internal strangulation of an obscure character. This rude operation is done as follows. The patient is anaesthetised ; he is then taken by the legs and suspended over the shoulders of a strong and tall man, who, jumping up and down several times, violently shakes the inverted and un- conscious patient. As the patient is hanging with his head downwards, and the other viscera as ivell as the abdominal are shaken up by this process, it need scarcely be said that care must be taken in its employment, and it would scarcely be safe, except in the young. I have knoAvn it to succeed in one case of obscure acute intestinal obstruction; and I have seen a case of fatal obturator hernia—um’ecognised during life—in which, at the j^ost mortem examination,, it seemed probable that immersion and shaking would have effected reduction, and so saved the patient. Operation for Acute Intestinal Obstruction.—AVhen a patient is suffering from the symptoms of internal strangulation which resist medical treatment, and have not yielded to inflation or immersion—if it have been thought expedient to employ either of these means—he will almost to a certainty die, unless relief can be afforded by operation ; and tAvo great questions AAflU at last press themselves upon the Surgeon’s attention :—1, whether it is advisable to have recourse to operative interference ; and, 2, when it is proper to undertake it. The solution of these questions is fraught with difficulty, and must ahvays be a matter of the most anxious consideration to the Surgeon. It is not only that he knoAvs that, if the patient be left unrelieved, he must neces- sarily die ; but that he is aAvare that the only means of relief, gastrotomy, is probably nearly as fatal as the disease for AA'hich it is undertaken. But the difficulties that present themselves in the solution of the question are much increased by the great obscurity in diagnosing the cause of the obstruction, for in many cases it is absolutely impossible to determine with certainty AAffiether it be dependent on ileus, or arise from mechanical causes ; and by the fact that apparently desperate cases occasionally recover Avithout operation. If, howeA'er, by attention to any of the points that have been pretty fully adA’ertedINTESTINAL OLSTliUCTION. ^ G8S to, it can be satisfactorily made out that there is an internal straiif^ulation, and jnore especially if tlie intumescence occasioned hy it can he felt, it will evidentlv hc the duty of the Surgeon to give the patient his only chance hy the divisioit of the stricture. AVith regard to the time at which this should he done, the only general rule that can be laid down is probably the conclusion aiTived at l)y Phillips ; that operation is justifiable when three or four days have passed without any relief from ordinary means, constipation being complete, and vomiting of fmcal matters continuing. Gastrotomy then may be required for the relief of acute intestinal obstruc- tion, arising from, 1, internal strangulation of the small intestine in whatcvei- -way produced ; 2, intussusception, or the slipping of the upper portion of a (H)il of intestine into, and its retention by, the lower ; and 3, ^•olvulus, or a semi-twist of the large intestine on itself. The operation of gastrotomy is performed as follo\vs. The room being well warmed, the patient should be laid on a high table, his legs being allowed to- liaug over the end of it, so as to afford a full view of the abdomen. The bladder having then been emptied, chloroform should be administered ; and the Surgeon, taking his stand between the legs of the patient, proceeds to make the incision through the abdominal wall. This should, as a general rule,, be carried through the linea alba directly in the mesial line below the umbilicus, more especially in children, and in thin subjects. If the patient be very fat, it might be necessary to extend the incision higher. It is very seldom, necessary, and never desh-able, to make the incision through the abdominal muscles to the side of the linea alba. By such a procedure the operation would in no way be facilitated, the wound would be more severe, the epigastric vessels endangered, and the after-liability to ventral hernia greatly increased. The- linea alba then having been exposed, the incision must be carried through the- abdominal wall until the peritoneum is reached ; this must then be slit up by means of a probe-pointed bistoury guided by the forefinger of the left hand> The coils of small intestine will now probably protrude through the wound, curling over its edges ; they must be drawn to one side, and be carefully supported by an assistant, who should press upon them with a soft towel, whilst the Surgeon searches for the obstruction. This he does by very careMly and gently tracing upwards the contracted and empty coils, which must necessarily be below the seat of obstruction, or by following downwards the distended intestine. If there be a hernial constriction formed by a dense adventitious fibroid band, he may divide the band that constitutes the stricture on a director by means of a probe-pointed bistoury or hernia knife, or break it through with the finger ; or he may withdraw, from the aperture in the omentum or mesentery into Avhich it had slipped, the constiicted coil ot intestine. If it be a case of volvulus, the colon may be untwisted, as in a case , on which I operated in 18-11). The intestines having been returned, the wound should be closed by the intemipted suture, and the application of some , transverse strips of plaster ; the patient must then have his knees bent over a pillow, and should be kept principally upon ice and barley-water. Opium must be continuously administered, and the case generally treated on the ordinary principles of abdominal wound. The mortality following gastrotomy for the relief of intestinal obstruction is, as might be expected, very high, amountingI TREATMENT OF INTUSSUSCEPTION. 689 to about 80 per cent. Thus Ashhurst finds that, in u7 cases in which the opera- tion was done, there were 11 recoveries only. . „ Intussusception, or the invagination of an upper into a lower ot intestine, is a common cause of intestinal obstruction, especially in chilcli'en. It may occur in three situations—viz., in the ileiun, at the ileo-caecal valve, or in the large intestine. The order of the frequency of its occm-rencc is in that ot its seat, as just given. These intussusceptions vaiy gi’eatly in length, ihey are short, not more than two or throe inches in length when occurring m the ■ small, 12 to 18 inches long when occurring in the large intestine. The intus- susception may be acute or chronic, according as it is more or less tightly strangulated. When acute, the symptoms of urgent intestinal strangu- lation are well marked, usually accompanied by spurious diarrhoea, caused by bloody mucous or glairy discharge from the included bowel. In such cases the patient, especially if a young child, -will die in the course of three to five days fi’om collapse. If older, he may recover by the iiivaginated portion of gut ■ sloughing away, and the continuity of the intestine being restored by the cohesion of the opposed serous surfaces at the neck of the invagination where the inversion has taken place. If chi’onic, the patient may live for some weeks , until worn out by irritation and pain. The acute intussusception is usually situated in the ileum. The chronic is at the ileo-cmcal valve, or in the large intestine. In all cases of intussusception there is a tumour at the seat of disease, caused by the doubling in of the inverted portion of gut. If the invagination be iliac and the patient thin, this tumour can be felt thi’ough the relaxed abdominal muscles. If the intussusception be ileo-cmcal, or in the large intestine, it can be felt by passing .the finger up the rectum. In one case, related by Hutchin- •son, the intussusception was of such a length that the inverted ileo-cmcal valve ^ was extruded for some inches beyond the child’s anus, and had been mistaken : and treated for a prolapsus. Treaimmi.—There can be little doubt that spontaneous disentanglement ocem’s : in many of the shghter cases of intussusception. In others, again, reduction of : the iiivaginated bowel may be effected by the forcible injection up the rectum I of tepid water, or the inflation of the bowel by air. These means, however, 1 cannot be expected to succeed in any case of intussusception, except that of the I large intestine. If it be at or above the ileo-cmeal valve, little good would result ; fi:om such measures as these. If these means fail, the only chance of recovery ■ without operation lies in the sloughing away of the invaginated portion of gut. And what is this chanee by natural care ? The answer given by statistics is as follows. J. L. Smith, of New York, collected the details of 50 cases ; of these / recovered. Haven, of Boston, found that of 50 cases, there were 10 ; and Huchaussoy, that out of 135 cases, there Avere 20 recoveries. The chance of life by natural means, therefore, is about 18 per cent., or rather more than one in five not a veiy hopeful one, truly. In these circumstances. Surgeons have natuially looked to gastrotomy, and the manual disentanglement of the in- vaginated gut, as offering a better prospect of life. And this operation has undoubtedly in many cases been followed by recovery, since, under the directions of hiuck, the first avcII authenticated successful operation of this kind Avas per- formed. Ashhurst has colleeted the particulars of 13 cases in Avhich abdominal VOL. II. Y YINTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION. 690 section was porfoi-mod for intussusception. Of these five succeeded; and more recently the operation has been successfully practised by Hutchinson and others. But the prospect of success will gi-eatly depend on the nature and seat of the intussusception. If the strangulation be very acute, and if the disease be seated in the ileum, the chances are not so favourable by any means as in the more chronic form of the affection, when the large intestine is the seat of the invagi- nation. In these cases the gut is incarcerated rather than strangulated. There is, as Hutchinson has well pointed out, no hope of natural cure by gangrene of the included portion, and the patient Avill die, worn out by irritation and pain, unless relieved by operation. As to the time at which the operation should be performed, it will necessarily vary gveatly in the acute and the chronic cases of intussusception, and whether the obstruction is seated in the ileum or the large intestine. If the invagination be attended by acute symptoms of strangulation, and if it be situated in the ileum, the operation must not be delayed after a fair trial has been given to such means as injection, inflation, inversion, and opium. If the invagination be chronic and colic, the urgency for early operation is not so great, though the necessity be eventually gTeater. The operation itself presents no difficulties. The mcision should, as a rule, be made in the mesial line, and the tumour is a guide to the seat of the strangulation. lYhen the invaginated gut is reached, it must be drawn out by a combined process of gentle traction and of kneading. It need scarcely be said that if collapse, tympanites, or symptoms of gangrene have set in, no operation should be undertaken, and that it is always of very doubtful expediency in young infants. After the operation, the usual treatment of opium and milk and ice should be adopted. Treatment of Chronic Intestinal Obstruction.—Gastrotomy is here not needed except in the one instance of chronic incarcerated intussusception, to which reference has already been made. With this exception, chronic in- testinal obstruction will be foiuid to arise from one of thi’ee conditions, viz.: faecal impaction, compression of the rectum by pelvic tumom’ of some kind, or stricture of the large intestine. Fcacal impaction is most common in elderly women. When it is suspected, the rectum should be explored, and if it be found to be blocked up by a rounded mass of indin-ated and impacted faeces, the Surgeon must condescend to undertake the duties of the nightmau, and empty the human cloaca of its fetid accumulations. This is best done by anaesthetising the patient, then dilating the sphincter ani with the hand, breaking down the indurated inass • with an iron spoon or lithotomy scoop, and washing it away by copious^ enemata. If the obstruction arise from the gradual compression of the rectum by an 1 intrapelvic tumour, or from the slow constriction of it or the colon by • lignani disease of the walls, purgatives will be worse than useless ; they vnll, irritate, will often induce vomiting, and will always considerably increase the patient’s distress, and should not be repeated. The patient should be kept' quiet in bed, and have a nourishing diet: one leaving little residue is to be ■ preferred,—the best consists of beef-tea, eggs, and a small quantity of ^ and the passage should be opened by enemata, and the introduction of the tuDc691 COLOTOMY. of a stomach-pump. If these means do not succeed, and if the obstruction, as lUv-ivs the case in these chronic instances, be seated in or below the sigmoid flexure of tlio colon, tlie intestine must be opened at a point above the “cofotZT-Thc opetatiou required to give exit to the intestinal contents, is of two kinds In one the intestine is opened in the left iliac fossa, by cutting lo^h the peritoneum covering it. In the other it is opened in the loin by cutting betwLn the layers of the meso-colon, being thus exposed Avhere it is uncovered by peritoneum. LiHres Operation.—first operation, or Littre’s, as it has been caUed, was nroDOsed by a Surgeon of that name, in 1710, who ad^fised that in these cases the sio-moid flexm’e of the colon should be opened from the left iliac region ; but iAvas not until the year 177G that any operation of the kind was per- formed when Pillore, a Surgeon of Eouen, was the first to make an artificial anus on the adult, for relief of retention of frnces ; this he did, not according to Littre’s method, but by opening the emeum from the right iliac region. Fine, of Geneva, in 1797, opened the transverse colon from the umbilical region, in a case of retention of fmces produced by scirrhus of the upper part of the rectum. ... „ . Although these operations serve to fulfil the indication of reheving the retention °of the feces, they are all defective in one most important respect; for, as the peritoneum must in all of them of necessity be wounded, an intense and frequently fatal peritonitis is the inevitable consequence. It was to avoid this serious complication that Callisen, of Copenhagen, in 1796, proposed opening the colon from b.ehind, in the left lumber region, where it is not covered by peritoneum. He once attempted this operation on the dead body of a child ; but, failing in his endeavour to reach the intestine without wounding the serous membrane, he seems to have relinquished aU further idea of it; and it was subsequently rejected as impracticable by aU writers on , surgery who treated of this subject. Amussafs Operation.—The operation of colotomy proposed by Callisen, but first practised and perfected by Amussat, is one of the most important addi- tions to modem operative surgery, and affords an admirable illustration of the important practical application of an apparently trivial anatomical fact, viz., the relation of the layers of the meso-colon to the descending colon. Amussat, at the time when he was attending the celebrated Broussais for that scirrhous affection of the rectum of which he ultimately died, was led to reflect on the resources that Surgery offers in similar cases ; and after making some experiments on the dead body, with the view of contrasting the merit of the different operations that have been proposed for the formation of artificial anus in cases of obstruction of the large intestines, he became convinced that the operation proposed by Callisen, if somewhat modified, was not only prac- ticable, but safe. He soon had an opportunity of putting this opinion to the test of experiment in 1839, in a private case, at which he kindly inrfted me, then a student in Pains, to be present; and since this time the operation has I taken a recognised position in Siu’gery. I It is not only for the relief of chronic intestinal obstruction that ikmussat’s I operation is now performed. Y Y 2INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION. 692 Colotomy may be required for the following conditions :— 1. Intestinal obstruction below the descending colon. • 2. Intense pain in defincatiou, in ulcerated cancer of the large intestine or rectum. 3. Cancerous fistula between the rectum and bladder. 4. Congenital absence of the rectum (p. 701). The following is the way in which Colotomy by Amussat’s operation may be performed. A transverse incision is to be made two finger-breadths above and parallel to the crista ilii of the left side, or rather in the middle of that space which is bounded by the false ribs above and by the crista ilii below; the incision should commence at the external margin of the erector spinas, and extend outwards for about four inches. The spinous processes of the lumbar vertebrte, the crest of the ilium, and the last false rib, are the principal guides. The superior margin of the crista ilii is, however, the safest of these ; and the transverse incision may be said to correspond to the middle third of this part of the ilium (Fig. 691). According to the ride laid down by Allingham, the centre of the incision should be exactly half an inch behind a line drawn Fig 601.—Line of Incision for LuniLar Colotomy. Dotted line indicates situation of Descending Colon. vertically upwards from the mid-point between the anterior and posterioi superior spines of the ilium. It is just under this that the colon will be found. After the skin and the more superficial tissues have been divided, the muscular layers of the abdominal wall are next to be incised as they present themseh es ; if necessary, the external border of the quadratus lumber urn may also be cut across. These structures should be divided to the same extent as the incision of the skin, otherwise the Sm-geon will continue to dig a deep and conical pit, and will certainly fail to recognise at the bottom of it the gut of which he is in search. The dissection is then very carefully to be carried thi-ough the fine but firm layers of areolo-adipose tissue, which lie immediately upon the intestine. When the patient is fat, these are loaded with adipose matter; when thin, they are semi-transparent and membranous, closely resembling peritoneum, for which, indeed, they may readily be mistaken. These layers immediately over- lie the colon, which may usually be felt and seen to bulge through them. After their division, the colon ivill, in general, readily present itself, and may at once be recognised by its greenish colour and distended appearance (Iig. 692b The operation may then be completed by passing a tenaculum, 01 a needle armed with a strong waxed thread, into the most projecting part of tCOLOTOMT BY AMUSSAT’S OPERATION. 693 gut, and by this means di-awing it to the surface of the wound, in order to pre- vent it fi-om shrinking or sinking back when opened. It is now to be punc- 1 tured with a large troehar or bistoury; and its contents having been evacuated, 1 the sides of the opening in the intestine are to be fixed to those of the incision ; in the skin by four or five points of suture, so as to prevent the contents of the /. bowel from being effused into the areolar tissue of the wound (Fig. 693). It ) is of importance to draw the colon well forwards before opening it, in order to 3 prevent its contents from being effiised into the loose ai-eolar tissue of the ( wound, when they may set up considerable irritation and retard the union of j the parts. In order to prevent that accident, the following procedure may be I adopted with great advantage. When the gut is exposed, two long silk ) sutures may be passed through it transversely parallel to the sides of the ; wound. Eaeh suture should have a needle at each end. The four needles I should then be passed through four points of skin, two in the upper and two in the lower side of the wound. The gut may then be opened between the I two sutiu’es, the finger introduced, the loops pulled out and divided and I rapidly tied. By this plan much time is saved, and the fecal matter prevented from running into the wound. If the patient be very fat, the operation is ‘ proportionately difficult on accoimt of the depth of areolo-adipose tissue lying in front of the quadratus, which requires to be very carefully dissected through before the gut can be reached. This step of the operation will be much facilitated by dividing the deeper seated tissues in a crucial manner, so as to give the operator more space. After colotomy, the patient will derive much comfort from taking powdered charcoal. It not only deodorises, but also tends to harden the feces. When recovery has taken place, the anal apertme in the lumbar region may be kept supported and closed by means of a truss with a large pad. BTien the operation is practised on the dead body, it will be found on dis- section that the following are the parts cut through. After the skin and areolar tissue, the latissimus dorsi will be seen divided towards the posterior third of the iucision, and the obliquus externus in the anterior two-thirds of it: the obliquus internus and the transversahs, sometimes the quadratus lum- borum, the areolo-adipose tissue which immediately covers the intestine, and finally the colon itself, come into view. The colon will usually be found a Kig. 092.—Incision in Left Lumbar Uegion in Ainii8s,it’8 Operation. Fig. 093.—Colon Opened and Stitched to Sides of Incision.<594 INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION. from tlie suiToiinding muscular structures. Very few vessels or nerves are Avouncled, as they for the most part run parallel to the line of ineision ; whereas, if the vertical incision of Calliscn were adopted, they would neees- sarily be cut across. Different Surgeons have variously modified this operation by making the incision vertical or semilunar instead of transverse. Amussat’s operation may be required in a totally different set of cases from those of intestinal obstruction, viz., in cases in which there is no distension of the gut, but in which the patient is worn out by the sufferings induced by the passage of feculent matters over an ulcerated cancer of the rectum, or in which great distress and discomfort arise from the perforation of the bladder or vagina by a rectal cancer, and the consequent passage of faeces into these cavities. In cases such as these, the object of the operation is not to relieve distension, but to give ease to the patient, to mitigate his sufferings, and consequently to prolong his life in comfort, by diverting the passage of the faeces from the ulcerated sm-face through the opening in the lumbar region, and thus removing the main cause of his sufferings. It has proved most successful in affording the desired relief. But in such cases, the opera- tion is somewhat difficult of execution ; for, on account of the contracted state of the colon, that intestine recedes behind the quadratus lumborum, and the folds of peritoneum nearly surround or invest it ; and it is so covered in by fat and areolar tissue, that a very cautious dissection is required to expose it without wounding the peritoneum. The difficulty may to a certain extent be lessened by thi’owing up a large bland enema just before the operation, so as to distend the gut somewhat forcibly. Lastly, it may be required in cases of imperforate anus in children in whom the rectum is absent, so that the gut cannot be reached through the perinteum. In operating on the newly born infant, it must be borne in mind that the kidney is very large, extends far outwards, and is enveloped in very little if , any fat, and that the meso-colon is often so long that there may be a difficulty in opening the gut without wounding the peritoneum. I am disposed to think that in these cases it may be better to open the ctecum in the right flank than the descending colon in the left (see page 701). Comparison of Littre’s and Amnssat’s Operations.—When we compare the different operations that have been proposed for the formation of an artificial anus, it will be found that Callisen’s, as modified by Amussat, is the one to which the preference must be given ; for by it alone the peritoneum is not wounded, and thus the inflammation of that membrane, which is a necessary and often a fatal consequence of the other operations, is avoided. Beside this advantage, which is of the very greatest importance, Amussat’s operation presents several other claims to our notice. As only one side of the colon can be drawn forwards, and not a knuckle of it, as would be the case if the small intestines were operated upon, it is evident that the spur- ^ like process, which has been described by Dupuytren, must exist to a very small extent; and, consequently, if the artificial anus should ever become use- less, the natm-al passage for the faeces having been re-established, it con d readily be closed up. If, however, the peritoneum should be accidental y wounded in the attempt to reach the colon from behind, even then this opera- ion would be preferable to that of Littre ; for, the ca\lty of the abdomen695 RESULTS OF COLOTOMY. i having been opened at its most depending part (in the recumbent position), the fiecal mattei-s woidd have much less tendency to be efPused into it, than if it were opened in front. In respect of not wounding the peritoneum, this operation closely resembles that of puncturing the bladder above the pubes, and below the reflexion of that membrane. There is, however, one important difference between the two operations, which may influence the result; in the one case, as the patient lies upon his back, the urine has a tendency to stagnate in the wound, being obliged, in order to escape, to mount against its OAvn gravity ; whilst, in the other case, the fascal matters find a ready exit from a Avoimd situated in a depending part. Ca3sar Hawkins has collected and analysed 44 cases, in which an artificial anus has been formed by opening the intestine ; in 17 of these the artificial ) anus was made through the peritoneum, and in 27 behind that membrane ; : but for various reasons, which are stated at length in the paper, Hawkins ex- : eludes 0 of the cases of peritoneal section, leaving only 12 to compare with 26 I cases of operation behind this membrane. Of the former he finds that 7 died I and 5 recovered ; the recoveries amoiuiting, therefore, to only forty-one per I cent, in the cases of this category; whilst of the 26 cases where the peritoneum > was iminjm-ed, 10 died and 16 recovered ; the proportion of recoveries in the cases of this category amounting to sixty-one per cent. Though the large intestine was opened in aU these cases, the operation was performed on the rigid side in 10 instances ; in 4 cases the right colon and caecum were opened through the peritoneum, and of these all died ; whilst of the remaining 6, in I which the right colon was opened behind the peritoneum, 4 recovered. The preference, therefore, as Hawkins observes, on the right side, is certainly due to the lumbar operation. It is remarkable, however, that in the operation on the left colon, the results are somewhat different; for, of 8 cases in which this intestine was opened through the peritoneum, 5 recovered and 3 died ; whilst of 20 cases in which the lumbar operation was performed, 11 recovered and 9 died. Hawkins observes, that the inequalities of the numbers appear, how- ever, to leave the question as to the mode of operating on the descending colon still undecided ; and that an operator is justified in selecting whichever situa- tion he thinks best for the formation of an artificial anus on the left side of the body ; still, for the reasons that have afready been given, there can be no doubt whatever that Amussat’s is very decidedly preferable to Littr6’s operation. In those cases in which death has resulted fr’om Amussat’s operation, peritonitis does not appear to have exercised any material influence ; and the fatal result seems rather to have depended on the influence of previous disease on the con- stitution of the patient, or on changes taking place in the diseased bowel, than on the operation itself, which appears occasionally to have been uselessly done at the last extremity. We should, therefore, have less hesitation in per- forming the extraperitoneal operation in an early stage of those cases in which it is called for, than we should if the section itself were attended with any serious risk to the patient’s life.696 TUMOURS OF THE GROIN. CHAPTER LXV. , TAPPING THE ABDOMEN.—TUMOURS OE THE GROIN. TAPPING THE ABDOMEN. The abdomen often requires Tapping, either for ascites or for encysted dropsy. This operation, which is one of the simplest in surgery, may be performed as follows. The bladder having been emptied, the patient is seated on the edge of the bed or of a large chair, or if very weak lies on the side, and has a broad flannel roller, split at each end to withm six inches of the middle, passed round the body in such a way that the untorn part covers the front of the abdomen, whilst the ends, which are crossed behind, are given to an assistant on each side, who must draw tightly upon them as the water flows. The Sm'geon then, seating himself before the patient, makes a small incision with a scalpel into the mesial line about two inches below the umbilicus, and through the opening thus made he thi’usts the trochar; as the fluid escapes, the patient often be- comes faint, but this may commonly be guarded against by continuing to draw upon the bandage so as to keep up good pressm’e in the abdomen. After all the fluid has escaped, the aperture must be closed with a strip or two of j)laster supported by a pad and bandage. The incision through which the trochar is thrust need not enter the perito- neum, though if it do it matters little. The trochar itself must be of full size, with a weU-fltting cannula. Sometimes it is convenient to have one fltted with a stop-cock, to the end of which a vulcanised India-rubber tube, as represented Fig. 657, p. 569, may be adapted, by which the fluid is carried quietly and vdthout splashing into the pail destined to receive it. Should the particular character of the accumulation of fluid in encysted dropsy not allow its with- drawal by an aperture below the umbflicus, the abdomen may be tapped in any other convenient situation, except in the course of the epigastric vessels. TUMOURS OF THE GROIN. Tumom’s of various kinds may develope primarily in the groin, or descend , into it from the abdomen. They are of the following kinds1. Enlargement 1 of the Lymphatic Glands. 2. Abscess in or around those glands. 8. Abscess descending into the groin from the abdomen—Psoas, Iliac, Pericecal, Peiiiie- phiitic, &c. 4. Yarix of the Saphena Yein at its entrance into the femoral, 5. Aneurisms of all kinds. 6. Osteo-Aneurisms. 7. Cystic Tumoiu-s, bursal, and developing in the muscular structiues. 8.

Malignant Tumours, primarily de- veloping- in the soft structures in this region, extending into it from the bones, , or secondarily from contamination of the glands. 10. Hernim of different I kinds—inguinal, femoral, and obturator. Diagnosis. In effecting the diagnosis of these various tumours, we must 1 fii-st distinguish the pulsating from those that do not pulsate. The Pulsating Tumours°rnust either be aneurisms, osteo-aneiu'isms, or cancers or abscesses \ with communicated pulsation. The diagnosis of these different forms of : disease has already been so fully given at pages 28 and 210, vol. II., that I i need not enter upon it here. The Non-Pulsating Tumours are to be divided into two great classes, I viz., the ReducihU and the Irreducible. ! The Reducible Tumours of the groin are either hernia, varix of the saphena ! vein, or abdominal abscess presenting under Poupart’s ligament. The diagnosis of these different conditions is given at pp. G59, GGO, vol. II. These all have an impulse communicated to them in coughing. ! The Irreducible Tumours of the groin have further to be divided into those that contain Fluid and those that are Solid. ' The irreducible tumours containing Fluid are either abscesses in or around the lymphatic glands, or cystic growths of various kinds. The diagnosis here is easy ; the irregular hardened outline of glandular abscess, its rapid develop- ment, and softening from a previously indurated state, will distinguish it from the tense, clearly defined outline, smooth and elastic feel of the slowly develop- ing and very chronic cystic growth. In irreducible hernia the impulse on coughing, the gm-gling, and other peculiar signs characteristic of that disease, will prevent the possibility of error in diag-nosis. The Solid tumours in the groin may either be simple or malignant. The history of the case, the feel of the tumour, the rapidity of its progress, the extent of contamination of neighbouring parts, and the other signs that serve as diagnostic differences between simple and malignant growths, will enable the Surgeon to effect the diagnosis with sufficient accuracy. The Treatment of many of these tumom-s, such as abscess of various kinds, aneurism, varix, and hernia, has already been so fully considered in the various chapters devoted to these diseases, that I need not enter upon it here. But the question of operating for the removal of cystic or solid tumours of the groin, is one that presents several special points for consideration. These are, the relations of the morbid mass, 1st, to the femoral vein ; 2nd, to the femoral artery ; and 3rd, to the abdominal cavity. If the tumoiu- lie upon or com- piess the femoral vein, oedema of the foot and leg mU be the result ; and, should the compression have been prolonged and very ckronic, this oedema may assume a semi-solid character, so as to occasion a condition of the limb closely resembling elephantiasis. Although an intimate relation such as this between the tumoiu- and vein would obviously inculcate the necessity for extreme caution, it need not necessarily preclude the idea of operating for the removal of the tumour, which may possibly be altogether above and unattached to the sheath of the vessels. I once successfrilly removed a nmvoid and lipo- niatous tumoiu- of many years’ standing, in a case where the limb was in a state o spurious elephantiasis from compression of the femoral vein, but the vessel698 TUMOURS OF TUB GROIN. was not involved in the growth. If the femoral artery he compressed to such an extent as to interfere with the circulation through the lower part of the limb, it will most probably be found that the tumour dips under or sun-ounds the vessel, so as to render removal impracticable. The mere overlying of the arteiy by a fi-eely movable mass, without any compression of the vessel, need not preclude operation. The growth figm’cd p. 34o, vol. II., was of this kind. The connection of the tumour with the abdominal or pelvic cavities under Poupart’s ligament, or through the obturator foramen, must be most carefully examined. Should this exist, or even be strongly suspected, operation is necessarily quite inadmissible. I699 OCCLUSION OF THE RECTUM. CHAPTER LXVI. —♦— DISEASES OF THE LAHOE INTESTINE AND ANUS. CONaENITAL MALFOBMATIONS. Congenital Malformations of the anus and rectum are by no means un- frequent, and are of considerable importance ; for, if unrelieved, they must necessarily be the cause of speedily fatal intestinal obstruction. They may exist in various degrees, which may most conveniently be an’anged under the following heads. Narrowing and Partial Closure of the Anus.—The canal continues pervious, but not sufficiently so to allow of the bowels being completely emptied, the contraction usually merely admitting a full-sized probe. In sonie cases the obstruction appears to depend upon constriction of the anal orifice, in others upon an imperfect septum stretching across it. Treatment.—This consists in notching the contracted anus with a probe- pointed bistoury, and then introducing a sponge-tent, so as to dilate it to the proper size, to which it must be kept by the occasional introduction of a bougie. Complete Closure of Anus.—The anus may be completely closed by a membranous septum stretching across it, usually having a raphe along the central line, and a slight depression, through which the dark meconium can be seen, and on which an impulse can be felt. This constitutes perhaps the most common form of malformation that is met with. Treatment.—In this variety an incision must be made through the septum along the middle fine, and this again cut across on each side, when the meconium vdll freely escape. The four angular flaps that are left must now be removed, and the aperture kept open by the introduction of a well-oiled plug. Occlusion of Kectum above the Anus by a Membranous Septum.— The anus may remain open ; but, at a distance of about half an inch or an inch from its aperture, the rectum will be found occluded by a perfect membranous septum stretching across it. This is a rare and somewhat puzzhng kind of malfoiTuation, as in it the infant vull be found to labour imder intestinal obstruction, and yet, on examination, the anal orifice will be found perfectly formed, and thus the Surgeon may be misled as to the seat of the obstacle. He will, however, detect it by introducing a probe or the end of his httle finger into the anus. Treatment.—The operation, of which the following are the details, will be found to be successful. 1. The child is put in the lithotomy position. 2. A trochar-cannula is then passed down to and pressed against the septum. 3. The stylet is then passed700 DISEASES OF THE LARGE INTESTINE AND ANUS. down the cannula and through the septum, 4. The trochar being pushed into the bowel, is withdrawn, and the cannula left in. 5. A probe is passed through the cannula, which is then slipped out over it and along the probe, or a director which may be substituted for it, a naiTow-bladed pair of dressing forceps is pushed up and opened out so as to dilate the opening in the septum. During this process, the retained fasces will have escaped. The apertm-e must be kept free by the occasional introduction and expansion of the forceps or of a lamiuai’ia tube. It is important to observe that, although the anus may bo perfectly formed and patent, with a canal above it about half an inch long, the rectum may be entirely absent, the sigmoid flexure terminating in an immense cloaca opposite the sacral prominence. In such cases it is of course impossible to reach the gut through the anus. In a case of this kind, in an infant four days old, iu which I was un- able to reach the gut through the anal aperture, I performed lumbar colotomy. Complete Absence of Anns.—The anus may be completely absent, being blocked up by a dense mass of flbro-cellular structm’e, from half-an-inch to an inch in thickness, above which the rectum terminates in a kind of cul-de-sac. Treatment.—An incision about an inch in length should be carefully made, from the point of the coccyx forwards, and the dissection carried down until the gut is reached ; this must then be punctured, and the meconium allowed to escape. If the cut surface be left to granulate, with a plug of lint merely interposed between its sides, it ■will gradually contract, and degenerate into a fistulous opening, through which the meconium will escape Avith difficulty ; and, as this track is not lined by a mucous membrane, the probabihty is that the irritation set up along it by the intestinal matters will ultimately prove fatal to the child. Indeed, it commonly happens in these cases that death results in a feAV days, from irritation occasioned by the absorption of the excreted fluids. In order to obviate this soiuce of danger, Amussat thought of bringing down the mucous membrane of the bowel to the anal orifice, and fixing it there by sutures, so as to afford the meconium a mucous canal to pass through, and thus to preA'ent the diffuse inflammation which is apt to take place in the areolar tissue of the pelvis, by the contact and absorption of the effused matters. In many cases it is by no means easy to do this, but it should ahvays be attempted, as I beheA'e the whole safety of the child depends upon this being carried out. For some considerable time after the operation, the aperture should be kept dilated by means of bougies; a gum-elastic or pewter tube, through Avhich the faeces are allowed to escape, may be fixed in the part. Closure of Anus with. Absence of Rectum.—It has already been stated that in some cases of perfect formation and of patency of the anus the rectum is absent, but more commonly the anus is closed when the whole of the rectum is Avanting ; the intestine (colon) terminating in a large and expanded pouch, situated high up at the brim of the pelvis, opposite the sacral prominence. A case of this kind differs from the last oifiy in the extent of the occhision, and cannot indeed be distinguished from it until the Surgeon has made an incision in the site of the anus, and has failed to reach the gut at the usua distance. mi . Treatment—Tuxqq com’ses present themselves to the Surgeon, i. J-uooperation. In four instances of this kind on which I have operated, it was rERINEAL INCISION. 7°! colon may be opened in the left iliac legion , left lumbar region; and, 3. An opening may 2. It may be reached in the be made into it through the pcnnffium^ Incision—The only advantaaos that the iliac incision or Littrd’s operation presents, are, that it is an operation easy of performance ; and that, whether the Surgeon reach the colon or not, he is certain to hit upon some part of the intestinal tube which may be drawn forwards and opened. The ohjections to this operation are, the inconvenient situation of the artificial anus ; the gi-eat danger that must necessarily result from wounding the peri- toneum ; the chance of not finding the sigmoid fiexm-e ; and, as has often happened, of being obliged to open that portion of the small intestine which firet presents itself. The mariah'tij after this operation is very great. Amussat states that, of twenty-one children thus operated on, only four ultimately recovered. Eochard, of Brest, however, writing in 1859, speaks of twelve cases as having occurred in the practice of himself and other Surgeons in that town, in seven of which the operation was followed by recovery. 2. Lumbar Incision.—The lumbar incision, or Amussat’s operation, has now been several times successfully practised on imperforate children. The advantages of this operation consist not only in the artificial anus being ■situated at a more convenient spot than in Littrd’s operation, but more especially in the possibihty of opening the colon in this situation without wounding the peritoneum. The objections to this operation, as applied to imperforate children, lie in the frequent co-existence of malformation or malposition of the colon with absence of the rectum, and in the impossibility in many cases of determining, before proceeding to operate, whether the anus is only occluded by a membranous septum, or whether the rectum is absent as well. If it could be ascertained beforehand that, though the rectum be absent, the descending colon occupies its normal position in the left lumbar region, I think it probable that the lumbar incision would be attended with less danger than any other operation that could be practised ; but, in the absence of this knowledge, it would scarcely appear to be justifiable to have recourse to it, as the colon might not be found, and the anus might merely be covered by a dense membranous septum. 3. Perineal Incision.—The perineal incision has the advantage of being in the natural situation of the anus, and of being easily practised and perfectly successful in all those cases in which the anus only is imperforate, the rectum being present. It is in those cases only in which there is congenital absence of the rectum that this operation is difficult of performance, and uncertain in its residts. The dissection requires to be carried with caution to a consider- able depth along the mesial line ; the Surgeon taking the cinve of the sacrum and coccyx for his guide, and, bearing in mind the relations of the bladder and large vessels in the neighbourhood, carefully proceeding in search of the gut, which may be found at a considerable depth from the surface. The danger of wounding the bladder must also be considered, and may be materially lessened by emptying this viscus by pressing over the pubes before commencing the702 DISEASES OF THE LARGE INTESTINE AND ANUS. necessaiy to proceed to a depth of at least one and a half or two inches l)cfore the bowel was reached ; which, on account of the naiTowness of the wound and the small size and important relations of the parts, is not an easy matter. If it could he ascertained before proceeding to operate, that the rectum is absent it might be wiser to search for the bowel in the lumhar region. But, as the Surgeon has no means of ascertaining, before making his incision, whether the rectum be one inch or three inches from the surface, he must cut into the perinEeum in order to obtain the necessary information ; and if once he have penetrated to such a depth as to pass beyond the levator ani muscle, or into the deep fascine in this situation, a great portion of the immediate danger of the operation will have been inciUTed, and few would think it advisable to leave the perineal operation unfinished, and expose the child to the additional risk of opening the colon in the lumbar region. Yet, if he have gone as deeply as he dare ventime, and have not encountered the bowel, there is no alternative but to open the intestine through the abdomiuEil wall, or to leave the child to its fate. In this alternative, Amussat’s operation should be performed. This has actually been done, and with success. I saw, some years ago, a young gentle- man eight years of age, who had thus been operated upon in Mexico for con- genital absence of the anus and rectum. An incision had first been made in the perina3um, but, no intestine being met with, the colon was opened in the left lumbar region. The boy was in good health, well nourished, had no great trouble with the artificial anus, which was covered with a truss pad, and only suffered occasional inconvenience from prolapse of the mucous membrane. There was a kind of sphincter-like action in the muscles about the orifice, hy which the finger was gripped. I have several times operated in this way on imperforate children ; but in all instances unsuccessMly. In one case, there was an anal apertme, hut with complete occlusion of the rectum. I operated on the fom-th day, first attempt- ing to reach the gut through the anus ; but, failing in this, performed the lumbar operation on the left side. There is one point in connection with the perineal operation to which it is of much importance especially to attend, not only as respects the immediate result of the operation, but as regards the ultimate success of the procedm'e ; I mean the bringing down of the mucous membrane of the gut, and fixing it to the lips of the external wound. Unless this be done, the fine of incision between the termination of the gut and the apertm’e in the integuments wiU degenerate into a fistulous canal; which, hke all fistula, will have a tendency to contract, and will be a source of endless emban’assment to the Surgeon and to the patient. If the mucous membrane can be brought down and fixed to the opening in the integument, this source of inconvenience wiU be removed, and the patient wiU be saved all that danger which results from the passage of the meconium over a surface of recently incised areolar tissue. This, however,, can only be done when the intestine tenninates at a short distance from the surface. If the perineal incision be two or three inches in depth, there wiU be little probabihty of the Sm-geon being able to bring the intestine down to such an extent. In the case that I have related I attempted to do so, but found that the gut was too firmly fixed to be removed by any traction that it would have been safe to employ.7°3 SIMPLE STRICTURE OF RECTUM. Absence of Anns: Opening of Rectum into other Canals- The anal orifice may be absent, and the gut may open into one of the neic^hbouring mucous canals, as the vagina, the urethra, or the bladdei. In such anomalous cases there is usually, I believe, but little to be done, except to restore the anal orifice if possible ; but, if this be impracticable, to make a Imnbar orifice, and then to take the chance of the otlier preternatural com- munication closing. This it will sometimes do ; and cases have occurred in which although the whole of the meconium with flatus had escaped urethrcnn, yet, on opening the rectum, the abnormal communication seemed m-adually to close, the fmces being directed into their proper channel. In a case in which I was once considted, there Avas imperforate anus and rectum, and the bowel protruded as a red fleshy tube, discharging meconium, and about four inches in length, from the anterior abdominal Avail, just below the umbiheus, and immediately abov'e an extroverted bladder. In such a com- plicated malformation. Surgery could evidently do nothing. STBICTURE—SIMPLE SYPHILITIC AND MALIGNANT. Stricture may occur in any part of the large intestine, but with very vary- ing. degrees of fr’eqiiency in different portions of that gut. Excessively rarely met AA-ith in the ascending or transverse, of unfrequent occurrence in the descending colon, it becomes more common in the sigmoid flexure, and very frequently occurs at about the junction of this portion of the colon with the rectum. In the rectum itself it is most commonly found either at the upper part, from four to six inches above the anus, or else a little above that aperture. It is of three kinds : 1. the simple, dependent on simple thickening of the intestinal coats ; 2. the sjjj>Mlitic; and 3, the malignciJit, consisting of cancerous degeneration of the walls of the gut, or of malignant masses obstructing the bowel. 1. Simple or Fibrous Stricture, though occasionally occurring in the trans- verse or descending colon, is most frequently met Avith in the sigmoid flexmu or at its junction Avith the rectum, or at the upper part of this gut, from four to six inches from the anus. This form of stricture of the large intestine commonly occurs in elderly people, and with special frequency in women. It is usually the result of long-continued diarrhoea or of chronic dysentery. Symptoms.—The symptoms of simple strictiue of the rectum consist at first of some difficulty in defecation, the patient being obliged to strain at stool. The fasces Avill also appear to be flattened, narrowed, or furrowed, and in many cases, more especially as the stricture advances, are passed in the form of small scybala, A\ith occasionally a kind of spurious diarrhoea, consisting of the passage of the more fluid intestinal contents, Avhilst the solid matters are left behind. At the same time there is veiy commonly pain in defecation, and the occa- sional passage of some mucus or blood ; and dyspeptic symptoms, Avith flatu- lent distension of the abdomen, are apt to come on. If the stricture be Avithin four or five inehes of the anus, it may be reached Avith the finger, and its precise situation and diameter ascertained. If above this point, it must be examined by the introduction of a well-greased bougie, attention being paid to the curve Avhich the rectum makes from side to side, as Avell as fr'om before backwards. In introducing a bougie in order to ascertain the presence of704 DISEASES OF THE LARGE INTESTINE AND ANUS. a, stricture above tbe upper eud of the rectum, but little information can be gained in many cases, as the point of the instrument is apt to hitch in folds of the mueous membrane, or opposite the promontory of the sacrum ; and thus, its onward passage being prevented, an appearance of constriction may present itself, which in reality does not exist, and unless care be taken the mucous membrane may actually be lacerated, and the instrument forced through it into the peritoneal cavity. In other cases, the bougie will appear to pass, when in reality its point, meeting wth an obstruction, curves downwards into the rectum. The Progress and termination of a simple stricture vary in different cases. In many cases persons vdll live on in very good general health through a long series of years, who present aU the symptoms of this simple stricture of the rectum. In others the contraction of the stricture may go on increasing, until at last complete occlusion takes place, with retention of faeces and all the symptoms of obstructed bowels. This condition usually comes on slowly, and, after the obstruction is complete, life may continue for several weeks ; but in some instances the obstruction seems to take place rather suddenly, and with all the symptoms of acute intestinal strangulation, death occumng in a few days. Abscess occasionally forms in the neighboiu’hood of the stricture ; and, passing down into the pelvis, may bm’st either into the ischio-rectal space, or into the vagina, or may present upon the nates. The diseharge of pus from this source, as well as from the mucous membrane lining the sfrictm'e, which falls into an ulcerated state, may induce extreme emaciation and hectic, to which the impairment of nutrition consequent upon the distiu’bance of diges- tion adds materially. Treatment.—The bowels should be kept moderately open, but purgation carefully avoided, as it is a source of much irritation. Castor-oil, Carlsbad salts, or saline aperient mineral waters in small doses suit best. The diet should be carefully regulated, and the strength kept up. The surgical treatment of simple stricture of the rectum must be conducted on the principle of dilating the canal at its constricted point. If this be within reach of the finger, the dilatation can be readily carried out. If it be above the upper part of the rectum, and the stricture be tight, it is extremely difficult to introduce the proper instruments with certainty. When the stricture is Ioav down, so that the end of the finger can be introduced into it, it may readily be dilated by introducing a rectum bougie every second day, and gradually increasing the size of the instrument. If the strictine yield but slowly, and be very tight and indurated, I have found it a convenient plan to introduce a sheathed probe-pointed bistonry into it and to notch it towards its posterior aspect, where this may be done without danger to the peritoneum, A tent of compressed sponge should then be introduced, and left in for twelve hoiu’s. On its withdrawal, bougies may more readily be passed ; or the dila- tation may be carried, on by means of tents of compressed sponge, IMien the stricture is above the reach of the finger, a good deal of management vdll be required to make the bougie enter it. This is best done by laying the patient on his left side, and using a moderate-sized wax or elastic bougie, which miis be passed without the employment of any force. When onee the Surgnon has introduced one, others can readily be made to follow in the same trac', leTREATMENT OF SIMPLE STRICTURE OF RECTUM. 705 great clanger in introducing a bougie high up, is to mistake the obstruction offered by its point coming into contact with one of the valyular folds of mucous membrane that occur in this situation, for that of the stricture, and, by pushing on the instrument, to perforate the bowel—an accident that would ; probably occasion fatal peritonitis. During the introduction of bougies, the I bowels must bo kept regular by means of lenitive electuary, and the occa- ! sional use of emollient enemata. If much pain or in-itation should be occa- i sioned by their iwesence, opium should be administered internally or in the I form of suppositories. Though a simple stricture of the rectum may be much I relieved by the use of bougies, it is seldom, I think, cured by this means ; I there being a great tendency in it to contract so soon as the treatment is I discontinued. ! Dilatation may sometimes be very conveniently effected by the use of Todd’s dilator (Fig. 694). This is introduced closed, covered with a thin vulcanised India-rubber sheath, so as to avoid nipping the mucous mem- brane. It is then expanded to the required extent by press- ing on a trigger in the handle. If complete obstruction occur, an endeavour should be made ' to relieve the patient by the use of enemata of gruel and linseed-oU, and the strength should be supported by a diet that is nourishing, at the same time that it leaves little or no solid residue ; the bowels may eventually act after a consider- able lapse of time, the strictiue apparently giving way. In a case to which reference has already been made, the stricture gave way after obstruction had lasted for about five weeks, some hardened fieces with bloody mucus being discharged, which were speedily followed by abundant feculent motions. Should the obstruction, however, continue, and the patient consequently be in imminent danger of death from this cause, the intestine should be opened, if possible, by Amussat’s opera- tion, perfonned in the way already described (p. 692, vol. II.) This may require to be done either on the right or the left side, according to the seat of stricture. In the majority of instances, this ndU be situated below the descending colon, so that relief may be given by opening this intestine in the left loin ; but if it be impossible or even very difficult to deter- mine the precise seat of the obstruction, the operation may as readily be performed in the right Imnbar region. In those rare cases in which the stricture is seated in the transverse colon, there would probably be considerable distension of the right loin, with- out any corresponding enlargement of the left; in these circumstances, the proper plan would be to open the cajcum. 2. Syphilitic Stricture of the Large Intestine is met with in the rectum fr’om one to three inches above the anal aperture, and chiefly in young women under thirty, rarely in men. They are essentially Hospital cases, seldom if ever seen in private practice. This form of stricture is usually situated an inch or two up the rectum. It feels as if there were a7o6 diseases of THE LARGE INTESTINE AND ANUS. tluckcnccl cicatricial annular constriction of tlie mucous membrane. At times there are ulcerations and fissures in and below this constriction, and very commonly the usual evidences of constitutional syphilis. I ha^•e seen these syphilitic ulcerations extend into the vagina, so as to establish a recto-A'aginal fistula. In cases of this truly disgusting disease, the general health is usually good, and the local symptoms of rectal stricture by no means severe. The Trealment consists in the usual means for the cure of constitutional syphilis, local dilatation, with or Avithout notching, and the application of nitrate of silver to the concomitant sores. 3. Cancer and Malignant Stricture.—Cancer of the rectum usually occurs in the form of infiltration of the substance of the Avail of the gut, gi\'iiig rise to considerable indiu-ation and contraction of the boAvel. In other cases, a flat cauliflower growth springs fi’om the inner surface of the intestine, being hard, nodulated, and presenting all the ordinary characters of scirrhiis ; sometimes it is pedunculated, so as to resemble a hmmorrhoidal protrusion. Lastly, a scirrhous tumour may form in the areolar tissue external to the rectum, and at last press upon and implicate the gut. Encephaloid is rarely met with in this region, but has been seen as a large, soft, rapidly growing fungating mass. Epithelioma is rare, and when it occurs is met with at the anal orifice, often as a somewhat notched and protuberant growth. It wiU be found to extend into the interior of the gut, Avhere it is more or less ulcerated. Adenoid Cancer or Columnar Epithelioma of the rectum or sigmoid flexure is far from uncommon. Fihro-plastic tumours will also sometimes develop in the rectum, and run a truly malignant course, with ulceration, sloughing, and rapid impheation of adjacent parts. Most usually cancerous disease is seated from three to five inches above the anus, and may implicate a considerable portion of the bowel, extending upwards rather than doAvnwards, giving rise to considerable induration and contraction, and attended, at least in some cases, by complete occlusion of the interior of the gut. Stjmptoms.—Cancer of the rectum is chiefly met with in middle life, but sometimes does not occm until advanced age. Both sexes are equally liable to it; if anything, it is more frequent in Avomen than in men. It is very insidious in most cases in its early manifestations. A sense of uneasiness, a tendency to dian-hoea, a slight discharge of blood or mucus, a, feeling as if the patient had piles, are usually the only early evidences off the development of this distressing disease. After a time, the rectal pain: becomes very severe. Thei’e is now a constant feehng of pain and aa eight in the gut, Avith a sensation as if the bowels had not been completely relieved, together Avith the discharge of mucus, blood, or pus, and some^ flattening of thei faeces. On exploring the parts Avith the finger, the lower portion of the rectum, Anil usually be foimd considerably expanded, Avhilst the tip of the finger will come into contact with the contracted, hardened, ulcerated, and rugged mass; at one part of Avhich an opening will be found leading mto a rugged, irregular, scirrhous cavity that passes up through the cancerous mass to the healthy gut above. The patient experiences most intense suffering duringSYMPTOMS OF CANCFli OF RECTUM. 7°7 p fiin r>ncnno-P nf ffvcGS ovci’ tliG iw aucl iilcex’ated Si B of a iS and burning cbaractor, but nsnally radiates rormd the loma and domi the thighs, and is so sOTcro that the pat.ent action of the bon-cls noth the greatest dread, and lestrams it ^ ‘ % sible The xvliole nervous system at last participates m this_ continua y rceuiTin-- suffering; the countenance becomes anxious; the spirits are de- pressed ;° sleep and digestion are destroyed. The patient’s condition is indeec truly miserable, between the dread of excessive suffering when the bowels act, on the one hand, and the fear of impending obstruction on the other, in many instances he is worn out by this suffering, together with the constitu- tional cachexy induced by the contamination of the system with the caneerous. Fig. 695. —Cancer of Upper Part of Rectum. At x jierforation took place, leading to fatal Peritonitis during administration of an Enema. matter. Not unfrequently the misery is much increased by the formation of fistulous openings in the neighbourhood of the bowel, and communications between it and neighbouring parts, such as the vagina, bladder, or urethra, with cancerous implication of them. Flatus as well as faeces thus get entrance into the bladder and vagina ; the flatus passing out with a rush, the faeces some- times obstructing the urethra, and often very seriously irritating the bladder, producing strangury and gicat pain. Death may put an end to the patient’s sufferings in several ways : by exhaustion from pain and continuous discharge, together with constitutional cachexy ; by perforation of the caneerous mass, which, ulcerating through at some point, opens into the peritoneal cavity, and, by hajmon’hage internal or into the gut, inducing fatal collapse, rapidly destroys life ; and in other in- stances, though more rarely, by fiecal obstruction, as in the case of simple stricture. The reason why intestinal obstruction is compai’atively rare in z z 27°8 DISEASES OF THE LARGE INTESTINE AND ANUS. cancer of the rectum is, tliat the diseased mass ulcerates and necroses more rapidly than it gTOAVs into the hoAvel, and thus an irregular chasm is left in its. centre, through Avhich the faeces pass. Treahncnt.—This must necessarily be palliative. The hoAvels must he relieved by occasional doses of castor-oil or by emollient enemata. Large doses of opimn, or of morphia injected hypodermically, arc required after each action of the bowels to lessen the patient’s distress. Little good can he ex- pected from more active measures ; dilatation only imtates the disease and Avould tend to increase the mischief. The application of caustics, such as potassa fusa, offers no prospect of advantage, as only a superficial slough could in this way be formed without very serious risk of perforation ; it is, besides, an excessively painful remedy. Amussat has proposed to crush and break down the morbid mass by means of the finger and forceps; but from such treatment as this little good can be anticipated. The recommendation to excise the cancerous mass, as made by Lisfranc and other French Surgeons, is contrary to every principle of good surgery ; as it is impossible to extirpate the whole of the disease, without either laying open the peritoneal cavity, or destroying the patient by the profuse heemorrhage, Avhich could scarcely be arrested. If palliative means fail in affording the requisite relief, and the patient suffer much local pain and constitutional irritation during defecation, the propriety of establishing an artificial anus in the left lumbar region by colotomy may be discussed ; not nnth a view of saving life, but rather in the hope of prolonging existence, and lessening suffering by preventing the exhaustion and agonising pain that attend the passage of the feculent matter over the ulcerated surface (p. G92, vol. II.). Colotomy may be required in cancer of the rectum for one of three reasons : 1. To relieve the intense agony resulting from the passage of freces over the ulcerated cancerous masses ; 2. To relieve the suffering and gi'eat discomfort occasioned by the freces passing into the bladder or vagina ; 3. For the rehef of more or less complete obstruction giving rise to stercoraceous distension of the abdomen. In any case it is only a palliative ; but by its means life may be prolonged as well as rendered more endurable. Cancer of the Anns.—This is not a very common affection ; it usually occurs secondarily in consequence of scirrhus of the rectum spreading to andl involving the margin of the anus. When it occurs as a primary disease,., it is usually in the form of epithelioma, and may then form about the anus,, just as it does at other muco-cutaneous apertures. If limited, and detected ini the early stage, it may advantageously be excised ; but at a more advanced! period of the disease, such a practice can scarcely be adopted with any prospect- of success, in consequence of the impossibihty of removing the whole of the: structines implicated. Fihro-Plastic Tumour of the Kectum is occasionally met Anth, forming, large and somewhat pale tuberose masses, projecting into the interior of thei gut, or even protruding through the anus, and giving rise to the same train ot local symptoms as characterise cancer of the gut—although the pain is kss intense. In such cases as these the disease may, if limited or pedunculated, be removed by double whipcord ligature or by the ccraseur. By means ot this instrument, I have removed from the inside of the gut a tumour of this kindrecto-vesical FJSTUUE. 709 ncai-ly as large as the fist. Rccm-rence may of course he expected, but the patient will get relief for a time. _ , 1 , Papilliform tumours are also met with in this region, causing much obstruc- tion, irritation, and Inemorrhage. They may be removed in some cases by dividing the sphincter, dilating the gut, and then extracting or destroying the mass. Polypi sometimes form in the rectum, constituting large pendulous tumours of a fibro-miicoiis character (Figs. G9G, G!)7). They often give rise to profuse Fit; GOO.—Poljinis of the Rectum with Pedicle, Kg. 097.—Polyims of the Rectum cut oiien, removed from child 7 years old. showing cysts Uueil hy Coluiimar Eiuthelium. and repeated htemon-hages.

RECTAL PISTtrL.ffil. ■ Fistulous openings occasionally occur between the rectum and the bladder in men ; or between this gut and the vagina in women. Recto-Vesical Fistulae are not of common occurrence, and usually result either from organic disease of a cancerous character, establishing a communica- tion between the rectum and the bladder ; or from a wound of the gut during the operation of lithotomy. In these cases the urine escapes per anum in gi’eater or less quantity, occasioning constant irritation or excoriation, with a sort of liquid diarrhoea ; and the wet state in which the patient is kept by the di’ibbhng of mine gives rise to an offensive ammoniacal odour about him. If the communication between the rectum and bladder be a free one, feculent matter and flatus get admission into the minary organ, and escape from time to time by the urethra ; perhaps even more abundantly than the mine does per • anum. This is especially the case when the fistula is carcinomatous ; and it is remarkable how little inltation is often set up by this admixtme of feeces with mine in the bladder. The flstulous apertmn in the rectum can ahvays readily be detected by passing the finger into the gut, or examining its interior with ! the speculum ani. Treatnieni.—If the disease be cancerous, nothing can be done in the way of I treatment beyond keeping the parts clean ; but if it be traumatic in its origin, I of small size, and more especially if it. be recent, its closm’e may not unfr’e- I quently be accomplished by touching it with the nitrate of silver, or a red-hot wire through a speculum ani. In these cases the galvanic cautery might advantageously be employed. If, however, the fistula be of old standing, and the aperture large, cauterisation will probably not succeed ; and then perhaps710 DISEASES OF THE LARGE INTESTINE AND ANGS. the only mode of treatment that can be adopted Avill be to introduce a grooved staff into the urethra, and cut through the sphincter upon this, thus laying the-, parts into one, and coiu-crting tlio anal into a perineal fistula. By keeping the catheter in the bladder, and emptying this, granulations null be allowed to spring up, and deep union be accomplished. In cancerous recto-^'csical fistula, colotomy may be had recourse to -with every prospect of mitigating the- patient’s sufferings (Yol. II. p. 708), and of thus prolonging life. Hiitero-Vaginal Fistula.—It has happened that a communication has been set up between the small intestine and the vagina, an artificial anus in fact forming m this cavity. These cases, however, are very rare, and may indeed be looked upon as incurable. Roux and Casamayor have endeavoured to establish, by a deep and difficult dissection, a commimication between the- small and large intestine ; but the operation, as might haA'c been expected,, has. proved fatal. Recto-Vaginal Fistulas may arise from two causes ; 1st, sloughing of the- posterior wall of the vagina, in consequence of some undue pressm-e exercised upon it during parturition ; and 2nd, its perforation by syphilitic ulceration. They are of two kinds ; viz., the simple, consisting of a button-hole opening, (and these are often syphilitic), and those compheated with more or less extensive laceration of the perinmum. The size of these fistulous openings, when uncomplicated with rupture of the perinjBum, varies greatly; in some cases there is merely a small perforation, ’in others there may be loss of the greater portion of the posterior wall of the vagina. Whatever their size, they are necessarily sources of very great discomfort and annoyance, both physical and mental, to the patient. The recog-nition of the disease is of course at once made ; the escape of the ffcces and flatus into the vagina being obvious, and digital or ocular examination through the two-bladed speculum at once detect- ing the seat and extent of the aperture. As there is just the possibihty of the- communication existing between the vagina and the small intestine, it may be- useful to bear in mind that, in this case, the feculent matter that escapes has been found to be yellower and less stercoraceous than when the rectum is- opened. The Treatment v'ill vaiy according as the fistula is simple, or complicated with lacerated periuEeum. SimjAe uncom'plicatecl Recfo-Vaginal, Fistula, if it be small and recent, may occasionally be closed by attention to cleanliness, at the same time that its- edges are touched with the nitrate of silver, a hot iron -wu’e, or the platinum loop. If it be very large, the greater part of the posterior wall of the vagina having been destroyed, it vill probably be incm-able ; but even here the patient should not be left to her fate, and some operation should be attempted which may lessen its size, even if it do not completely close it. The kind of fistula Avhich is here most commonly met with usually consists of a circular aperture, that readily admits the point of the finger, as it is situated just above the- sphincter ani. The operation for the closure of a recto-vaginal fistula of this kind consists, after emptying the patient’s bowels by purgatives and an_ enema, and the bladder by the catheter, in introducing a duck-billed specuhun into the vagina, and freely paring the edges of the aperture. As the fistula is a n a} s low doivn, this is readily'done by placing the patient on her back, and tying-ULCER AXJ) FISSURE OF ANUS. 711 the luvncls and feet together, as in lithotomy. The vaginal mncous membiane slionld be dissected olf towards the fistula. The next point is to bring its edges into apposition, in a direction transverse to the axis of the vagina ; and in doing this, the recommendation made by Copeland and Brown, of dividing the sphincter ani, should always be acted on, as it is a most important auxiliary to the success of the operative procedures that are required ; for, as there is always loss of substance in these fistula), there is necessarily a tendency to tension on their sides when any attempt is made to draw them together ; and it is also of importance that any muscular movement about the parts in the neighbour- hood of the fistula) should be aiTested, as this might otherwise break down union after it had taken place between the edges. The sides of the fistula must then be drawn into apposition by silver sutures introduced by means of the hollow needle. I have generally found that these sutures are most easily introduced if passed/rowi alove downwards—the, mucous membrane being then drawn upon by the needle, which more readily transfixes it than if it be introduced from below upwards, when it is left to push the membrane before it. The Avires are then passed across the fistula and out through the vaginal mucous membrane, half an inch beyond the freshened surfaces, care being taken not to include the rectal mucous membrane. They may then be twisted, or brought through a leaden plate and clamped by shot. The success of the procedure depends not only on the proper completion of the steps of the operation, but greatly on the after-treatment. This should consist in the administration of opium, to pre- vent the bowels from acting for ten or tAvelve days ; indeed, until firm union has taken place between the edges. They may then be moved by means of laxatives and oleaginous enemata carefully given. During the treatment, the parts should be disturbed as little as possible, the patient lying on her side Avith a gum catheter tied in the bladder. The parts should be well syringed tA\-ice a day Avith cold water. The patient must be kept upon a A'ery moderate diet, and the stitches may be left in for eight days, when they must be cut out and carefully removed. Should any point of the fistula not be closed, the appheation of the nitrate of silver may induce proper union of it. If, as very commonly happens, the Recto-Vaginal Fistula he complicated -with a Lacerated Perinceum, the operation for that condition, described at p. 655, vol. I., must be performed, and the edges of the fistula, being deeply pared, bi’ought together at the same time. Sometimes in these cases it happens that the perinteum unites, leaving an aperture above this in the recto-vaginal septum ; if this aperture be but small, it may be closed by its edges being touched from time to time Avith the actual cautery ; if it be large, so as to allow the introduction of the finger, I believe that it is generally useless to attempt to close this apertmn by itself; but the perinteum should again be divided, and the Avhole operation repeated. ULCER AND FISSURE OP THE ANUS. This disease, though trivial in point of size and in its pathological relations, is of great practical importance, on account of the excessive local pain and great constitutional iiritation to Avhich a patient labouring under it is often subject. Ulcer and fissure commonly exist together in this situation, though it by no means unfrequently happens that the two conditions occur separately.712 DISEASES OF THE LARGE INTESTINE AND ANUS. The ulcer is usually of small size, seldom larger than a silver three-pence, of a circular or longitudinal shape, situated between the folds of the mucous mem- brane in the npper part of the anus, or rather the lower part of the rectum, just above the ring or ledge formed by the sphincter, and is usually met with towards the posterior part of the gut on one side of, or opposite to, the point of the coccyx. Occasionally more than one ulcer exists in this situation. If a fissure accompany the ulcer, it commonly leads from this across the face of the sphincter to the verge of the anus ; but in many cases one or two fissures, sometimes even three or four, exist without any ulcer. The fissures are usually slightly indurated and cord-like, extending merely through the mucous membrane, scarcely, if at all, implicating the deeper structures ; and not un- frequently their external termination is concealed by a small red pile or flap of integument. The existence of the ulcer may usually be determined by exploring the rectum with the finger, which, if practised in these examinations, udll detect a small, soft, and velvety patch at the diseased spot; on touching this, the patient will usually complain of acute and biuming pain. In some cases the ulcer may be brought into view by examining the rectum with the speculum ani, here delineated (Figs. 698 and 699). The fissmn may always readily be detected by everting the mucous membrane of the anus, and by lifting up or turning aside the pile that covers the lower end of the crack. During this examination, it wdU usually be found that the sphincter ani is in a more or less spasmodically contracted state, admitting the finger and instrument with difficulty. Symptoms.—The symptoms of ulcer or fissure in the anus are very character- istic. The patient complains of pain, nsually of a severe binning character, on the passage of a motion, especially if a hard one ; occasionally it occurs at the time of defecation, but more frequently commences a few minutes afterwards. Fig. 698,-Aual Dilator. Fig. C99.-Sreculum Ani. and continues from half-an-hom’ to several hours. This pain is very severe, and peculiarly wearing and burning ; it is generally most felt opposite the sacro-iliac articulation, but not unfrequently radiates roimd the pelvis or doivn the thighs. In many cases it produces a good deal of continued irntation about the genito-urinary organs, giving rise to symptoms of spasmodic stricture;TREATMENT OF ULCER AND FIESURE. m a frequent desire to urinate, tenderness about the prostate, and seminal emis- sions. The pain is sometimes so severe that the patient c^oids defecation as long as possible, and even abstains from food with the view of lessening the necessity for the fr-eqiiency of this act. Very commonly in women,^ the pains produced by the rectal disease simulate those occasioned by uterine irritation ; and in both sexes tliey may after a time become continuous, and be attended by a good deal of constant uneasiness in sitting, so that the patient is obliged to raise the hip of the affected side. There is often a discharge of a streak of pus or blood on the fteces, and conmionly a good deal of mucous exudation, with some tenesmus on defecation ; but in some instances these symptoms are altogether absent, and the patient never suffers any local inconvenience except from the pain. The constitutional irritation is often very gTcat, the iierA'ous system gene- rally sympathising with the local mischief. The countenance becomes pale, anxious, careworn, and the patient’s expression is indicative of constant suffering. Causes.—This affection most commonly occurs in women, especially in those of an hysterical temperament and weakly constitution. When met with in men, , it is most frequently seen in enfeebled, cachectic, and debilitated subjects, and appears to be the result of a broken state of health. In persons who have been the subjects of the chi-onic dysentery of hot climates, I have several times noticed a peculiar form of patchy ulceration within the rectum, of an extremely iiTitable and very intractable character. I have in several instances observed it in women to be of a syphilitic nature, and in such cases it is situated gene- rally towards the side or the anterior part of the anus. The rectum may be injured by bloAvs or falls upon the sacrum or coccyx. Fissm’e, laceration of the mucous membrane, ruptiu’e of the muscidar fibres, or even the detachment of the whole of the rectiun from its connections with the sacrum and coccyx, may ensue from these injuries. Treatment.—The treatment of fissure or ulcer of the anus, when the disease is met with in the early stages, may sometimes be successfully conducted by the application of nitrate of silver to the fissime, and the use of an anodyne or astringent suppository. I have found a very excellent and useful suppository in this and many other painful affections of the anus to be composed of 2 grains of extract of belladonna, 2 grains of the acetate of lead, and 4 of tannin, made up to a proper consistence mth a little cocoa-butter. This may be introduced into the rectum every night and allowed to dissolve there ; the bowels should at the same time be kept gently open with castor-oil, or the lenitive electuary. In those cases in which the disease has been of some standing these means will not suffice, and it becomes necessary to have I’ecom’se to a very simple operation to effect a cure. This consists in dividing the affected mucous membrane through the ulcer or fissure, with possibly some of the subjacent fibres of the sphincter muscle, by which the part is set at rest, and cicatrisation speedily takes place. The relief after the operation is usually immediate ; indeed, after its performance, a patient who has been suffering severely for months or years, wdl often get complete and almost instantaneous relief. The merit of intro- ducing this plan of treatment for the cure of ulcer and fissm-e of the anus into sm-gical practice is due to Sir B. Brodie. Boyer had previously recommended714 DISEASES OF THE LARGE INTESTINE AND ANUS. that the sphincter should bo cut completely across, in order that its action might be paralysed ; but Brodie found that the ulcer could be made to heal as readily by the limited incision above mentioned. The operation is readily done by introducing the left fore-finger into the rectum, guiding along it a piobe-pointcd bistoury, and then cutting downwards and outwards, carrying the knife about the eighth of an inch in depth. No dressing is required after this operation ; but, if the incision do not readily heal, it should be touched fi'om the bottom with the nitrate of silver. The patient’s bowels should be well opened befoie the operation, and a dose of castor-oil may be given on the second or third day alter it. During the process of cicatrisation it n ill often be advantageous to give iron, and to jmt the patient on a noiu’ishing diet. Spasmodic Contraction of the Sphincter Ani is usually associated with fissme 01 ulcer of the anus, or inflammatory irritation of some ncighboiu’ing organ ; but occasionally it occurs without this complication, and in all cases it may be connected Avith a neimalgic condition of the part. In hysterical Avomen, this neuralgia and spasm are especially apt to occur ; though it is not improbable that, in many of the so-called cases of neuralgia of the anus, some positiA’e disease, such as a small ulcer or fissme, may be detected on close examination, as I have had several occasions to verify. The Treatment of contraction of the sphincter, Avhether associated Avith. neuralgia or not, consists in the employment of local sedatives, especially the extract of belladonna, gr. j. to gr. ij., as a suppository ; the boAvels being kept relieved by enemata and confection of senna. Should these means fail, the patient must be antesthetised, and the sphincter forcibly dilated with the Simgeon’s fingers. Atony of the Rectum is common in middle age, in those who lead seden- tary lives, and especially in women. This condition is the consequence of and leads to habitual constipation, the Avails of the rectum becoming expanded and pouch-like. It may occasion the retention and impaction of hardened feces. A mass of clayey consistence, and as large as the foetal head, forming in the rectum and interfering seriously Avith defecation, becomes a source not only of great discomfort but of serious ill health. Like all retained excreta, it slowly poisons the system, giving rise to foul breath, dirty greyish complexion, and mental depression. The Treatment of atony of the rectum consists in scrupulous care in empty- ing the boAvels by the adruinistration of cold enemata. If impaction of feces have occurred, this is to be remedied only by putting the patient imder chloroform, forcibly dilating the sphincter with the hand, and breaking down the hardened mass with a lithotomy scoop or iron sjioon, Avasliing it away Avith enemata, and thus clearing out the bowel. (See p. G70.) ABSCESS AND FISTULA. Abscess not imfirequently occurs in the vicinity of the rectum and anus. It may either be superficial, being confined to the muco-cutaneous structures, and presenting the ordinary characters of acute subcutaneous abscess; or it may bo deeply seated, forming in the ischio-rectal fossa. It is these rectal abscessesISCJlIO-llECTAL ABSCESS. 715 that arc of most practical importance. Tlicy may be of two kinds—Acute and Chronic. Acirte Ischio-rectal Abscess.—This foi’ms dceidy in the fossa, Avith throbbing, shooting, and stabbing pains tlirongh the anus, rectum, and pcrinajnm ; on examination, a liard brawny substance may be felt in the areolar tissue by the side of the gut, either by examination from Avithout, or by exploration through the rectum. It speedily softens, and Avill, unless an outlet be made for it, either burst externally, or into the cavity of the gut, or both Avays. This acute form of abscess usually occurs in persons of otherwise strong and healthy constitutions. Chronic Ischio-rectal Abscess, on the other hand, occurs insidiously in persons of cachectic, broken, or phthisical constitutions. Without much pain or local inconvenience, it forms a collection of pus, Avhich is usually limited to one side of the ischio-rectal fossa, but in other cases acquires considerable magnitude, denuding the gut to a considerable extent ; in fact, almost sur- rounding the rectum, and then spreading widely on the nates or hip, presenting all the ordinary characters of a chronic abscess. This kind of purulent col- lection may form in this as in any other situation in the body, as the result of congestion or of some local irritation. I hax'e scA’eral times seen it follow kicks, blows, or bruises of the loAver part of the body, or as a consequence of the lowering of the Autality of the mass of areolo-adipose tissue on the ischio-rectal fossa by weakly persons sitting on a cold stone, or standing for a long time on the ice or snoAv. In other cases the mischief appears to originate- ai’ound the prostate, and an abscess forming in this situation may find its Avay doAvn by the side of the rectum. Sir B. Brodie attributed these abscesses,, and the consequent fistulm, to perforations of the mucous membrane of the- gut; and although I think he exaggerated the frequency of this mode of pro- duction of the abscess, yet there can be no doubt that, in some instances at least, it occurs as the result of perforation of the boAvel; either by ulceration- fiom Avithin, by the formation of a fissiu’e, or by some foreign body, as a fish- bone, transfixing it, and thus inducing inflammatory action in the areolar tissue outside the rectum. Tteatnient. In the treatment of these abscesses, the principal point to be- attended to is to prevent the extensive denudation of the gut. In order to do- this the abscess must be opened, so soon as the formation of j)us can be ascer- place, by making a free, and, if necessary, a deep incision in 0 ^ e ISC 10-rectal space by the side of the bowel. Unless this be done, it may mt ei burst into the interior of the gut, or spread widely upon the nates, an en give Avay. The pus that is let out of these collections is always ex reme y offensive, even though not mixed with any feculent matter ; thn near neig oiirhood of the boAvel appearing to determine some change in it that renders its smell peculiarly stercoraccous. After the evacuation of the abscess the patient feels easy, and thinks that all is well, the discharge gn:adually essening and the caAlty contracting; but it does not close, and a fistula Avdl be left, which continues to exude a thin watery pus, in Avhicfi feculent matter, perhaps, accumulates from time to time, giving rise to fresh outbreaks and extensions of the disease. Bisto-la in Ano.—The sinus loft by the contraction of the cavity of an7i6 diseases of the large intestine and anus. iscliio-rectal abscess constitutes a fistula in cino; an affection that has attracted a good deal of attention from the frequency of its occuiTence, and from the difficulty of curing it without ha'V'ing recourse to operation. Extent.—Sometimes a fistula is very limited, being merely the sinus left in the submucous areolar tissue of the anus after the biu’sting of a superficial abscess in this situation, extending to a short distance up the gut inside the sphincter. This form of fitsula constitutes, however, a kind of spimous variety of the disease ; for the true fistula in ano is outside the sphincter in the surrounding areolar tissue, extending always as high as the upper margin of that muscle, and fi’equently stretching to a considerable distance up the side of the gut, i\Iost frequently the lower and external aperture of the fistula is single, and is situated by the side of the anus in the ischio-rectal fossa, just beyond the sphincter ; but not unfrequently the aperture is in the perinaium, or posteriorly in the coccygeal region. Occasionally there is a fistulous opening on each side of the gut; or several openings may exist, and then sinuses ex- tend fr’om these upwards and outwards to a considerable distance, undennining the integuments of the perinaeum about the buttocks, even stretching away towai’ds the trochanters, and opening at a gveat distance from the bowel. These extensive fistulas and sinuses are frequently connected vuth strictm’e of the gut ; but they may occur without this in old and neglected cases of the .simple disease. The fistulas are usually oblique, but straight in their direction from a point half ail inch or an inch from the anal apertiu’e, running upwards to above the sphincter. In some cases they are tortuous ; and, occasionally, when opening at a distance from the gut, and extensively undermining the integuments, they are angular, having, as it were, an elbow at that point where the super- ficial sinus meets the deep fistula. This peculiarity will prevent the passage ■ of a probe through their whole length until the external sinus has been slit up, and the commencement of the deep fissme reached, and may lead to the suppo- sition of the fistula being more superficial than it in reality is. Varieties.—Fistula in ano is said to be Complete when it communicates by one end with the interior of the rectum, and opens by the other upon the external surface. It is said to be Incomplete when it has only one apertm-e, whether that be external or internal. Complete Fistula is the most common form. It probably arises in the majority of cases from some som’ce of irritation seated within the bowel, by which the mucous membrane of the rectum has been perforated, and an a.bscess has formed in the areolar tissue outside the gut. The external opening in this form of fistula is usually from half an inch to an inch from the margin o the anus ; though it may be seated at a greater distance than this, as upon the hip. It is commonly small, and has avascular granulation projecting from or occluding it; and a thin purulent discharge usually drams away fr-om it m ■ small quantities, moistening the surrounding integuments. The internal open- ing is usually situated just above the sphincter, where the rectum begms _o expand. But the fistula does not terminate at this internal aperture ; ^ or m the majority of cases it runs up into a kind of cnUte-sac, to a consi em e is . tance further. The internal aperture may readffy be detected by introduc „ * blunt curved probe into the fistula ; when, by a little management, it mayOPE EAT 10 X FOR FISTULA IX AXO. 7^7 caiTiecl through the inner opening. In some cases, the existence of this may be ascertained by examining the interior of the bowel with a specnlnm ani, and "jjy jjfiioctiiio* "Water into the external opening. Incomplete or Blind Fistula may be of two kinds, and commonly arises- from constitutional causes. When there is no internal perforation, a mere sinus having been left by the bursting of an abscess, the fistula is termed Umd external 'Ulien there is only an internal aperture, it is called Uind internal The blind external fistula is readily recognised by its being found that the probe does not penetrate the interior of the gut. The blind internal is not so readily detected ; but in this case it will generally be found that the patient suffem from an occasional and tolerably abundant discharge of pus fr’om the interior of the bowel; that there is a good deal of tenderness, with some brawny indication in the ischio-rectal fossa on one side of the anus ; and that the pus may be made to well out in some quantity by pressing upon this part. On passing the finger into the rectum, the ragged internal aperture in the gut through which the pus exudes may readily be felt. Operative interference is usually necessary. It is time that in some rare instances the fistula may be made to close under the infiuence of constitutional management, aided, perhaps, by stimulating its interior with the- nitrate of silver, or by touching it with a probe dipped in nitric acid. This kind of treatment is, however, only successful in the blind external fistula, several instances of which I have seen recover in this way ; but it can never be expected to answer in any other variety of the disease. Occasionally in elderly people a blind internal fistula (or fistulie) will be found, which, falling into a very chronic state and discharging but little, is a source of but very trivial diseomfort, and will continue for years without giving the patient serious local inconvenience, and in no way disturbing the general health. In such cases, I beheve, there is often far less risk in leaving the fistula un- touched, than in subjecting the patient at an advanced period of life to the hazards of an operation. When the fistula is complete, the only plan of treat- ment that offers any chanee of success is the division of the sphincter; so that this muscle, which tends to prevent the closure of the sinus, may be paralysed, and the fistula, being laid open from the bottom, made to heal by granulation. Various plans have been devised for the division of the sphincter, and much ingenuity has been expended in attempts to discover simpler and less painful modes of effecting this than by the knife, but hitherto without success ; and the only plan of treatment that deserves any attention is the division of the sphincter with a curved bistoury. The Operation for fistula in ano should not be performed indiscriminately in all cases and at all periods of the disease. If the fistula be dependent upon stricture of the gut, and more especially if this be of a malignant character, it is evident that no operation can bo attended by a chance of success, and none should be^ attempted. So, also, if the patient be cachectic and broken in health, it is well to improve his constitutional powers before undertaking an operation, lest the wound that results may not readily cicatrise. It is also Avell to wait until the disease has assumed a someivhat chronic form before proceeding to the division of the sphincter ; if this be done early after tlie bursting of the abscess, or at any time if there be much inflammatory action7i8 diseases of THE LARGE INTESTINE AND ANUS. goino- on, the M'ouncl is apt to assume a somewhat sloughy condition, and to heal with great difficulty. The most important question usually connected with the operation for fistula, is the propriety of performing it in phthisical subjects. It is a well-known fact that fistula in ano is especially apt to occur in consumptive individuals, and it is often a nice point to determine whether an operation should be performed or not in them ; how far the drain from the fistula may keep up or even generate the tendency to phthisis, or how far it may be salutary in acting as a counter-irritant, and in preventing the morbid ■condition of the lung from developing itself. Theophilus Thompson has stated that the co-existence of fistula with phthisis appears to retard the progress of the latter disease, acting as a derivative ; and doubtless in some instances this may be so. I have, however, in several cases found consider- able advantage result from operating for fistula in the early stages of phthisis, or in suspected cases of that disease, the patient’s health having considerably improved after the healing of the fistula. In such cases it may be of use to put an issue in the arm or side of the chest. But in confirmed, and still less in advanced phthisis, no operation should ever be practised ; as the wound will not heal, and the patient must be weakened by the additional discharge. The operation for comiAde. fistula should be performed in the following way. The bowels having been well cleared out the day before with a dose of castor- oil, and an enema administered on the morning of the operation, the patient should be laid on his left side, -with the nates projecting over the edge of the bed ; a probe must then be passed through the fistulous track into the rectum, and the Surgeon, introducing the forefinger into the gut, feels for the end of the instrument; he then passes a short strong-bladed probe- pointed bistoury of about the size and shape of that represented in the an- nexed figure (700) through the fistula, using the probe as a guide, though in some cases this may conveniently be dispensed with. Vl hen he feels the end of the knife projecting into the rectum thi-ough the internal aperture of the fistula, he, after withefi-awing the probe, hooks his forefinger over it (Fig. 701), and by a sweeping and pressing cut, raising the handle of the instrument at the same time that he pushes doum its point, brings both finger and blade out at the anal aperture, cutting through the whole thickness of the parts between this and the fistula, so as to lay the two ca^ufres into one. Care slioidd be taken to divide the sphincter in a direct anc not an oblique manner, lest a flap or fold be left which will interfere with the proper healing of the wound. In ration, the Surgeon should cut with his left hand if the fist a •be upon the left side ; and in cither case should be careful not to Dionne Fig. 701.- -Operation for Fistula in Ano. Fig. 700.— Froljc-pointed Histoui-y for Fistula.719 after-tbeatment of axal fistula. own fino-cr, as siicli cuts often pro^’c troublesome in healing. Where the external°xperture or iiperturcs of the fistula are at some distance from the gut, the inte<nimeuts being undermined to a considerable extent, perhaps thinned, soft, and bluish, all the superficial sinuses should bo slit up ; and, in those cases in which the course of the fistula runs more or less at a right angle Mith that of the external sinus, it is necessary to do so before the deep or internal fistula can be reached, through which the sphineter must be divided. If the fistula be a Uml exlerncil one, it must at the time of the operation be made complete, by scratching with the end of the knife through tlie thinned struc- tures that intervene between its extremity and the interior of the gut; and the operation must then be completed in the way described. If it be a hlmd mUrnul fistula, a bent probe should be passed up the anus and through the inner opening of the fistula into the canal. The end of this, which can be felt externally, must be exposed by a puncture made through the integuments with a sharp-pointed bistoury, and the operation then concluded in the or- dinary way. When there is an internal aperture into the gut, this will usually be found just above the sphincter ; ljut the fistula does not terminate here, frequently extending up by the side of the gut for an inch or two. In these circum- stances, what should be done with the cul-de-sac above the inner aperture ? If it be laid open, an extensive and deep wound wall be inflicted, which may implicate some of the hmmorrhoidal vessels, and thus give rise to a dangerous amount of bleeding. Hence I think it a safer practice for the Surgeon to con- tent himself with the division of the sphincter and aU the parts intervening between the inner apertm’e of the fistula and the verge of the anus ; the sinus which is left usually contracting and closing without difficulty when this has been done. In some cases it happens, however, that this cul-de-sac is not readily obliterated, but gives rise to a good deal of trouble in consequence of the occasional accumulation of ]dus in it, and the thickening of its apertiu'c into the bowel giving rise to spasmodic contraction of the sphincter and a kind of rectal stricture. This incouA^enience gradually subsides in most cases, under the use of astringent injections or the introduction of a probe armed with nitrate of silver. If the integuments around the fistula have been much undermined and thinned so as to leave loose flaps at the edges of the incision, the cure aauU be materially hastened by cutting these off. The after-treatment should be as simple as possible, consistently with securing closui’c of the wound by granulation from the bottom. A narrow slip of oiled lint should be introduced between the lips of the wound, and this must be left in tor forty-eight hours, during which time the bowels are kept confined by the administration of a grain or two of opium immediately after the opera- tion. On the second day a dose of castor-oil may be administered, Avhich Avill not oidy act upon the bowels, but bring away the piece of lint. The Avound must then be lightly dressed from the bottom, a poultice applied, and care taken at the daily dressing, by the introduction of a probe, to prevent the bridging OAer of gi'anulations. After the AV'ound has completely united, a notch Avill usually be left by the side of the anus, Avhich gives rise to some inconvenience for a time by the occasional involuntary discharge of a little intestinal mucus, and some flatus. This especially happens in those cases in720 DISEASES OF THE LARGE INTESTINE AND ANUS. which the incision has been made anteriorly to the anus into the porimcnm and where incontinence of feces may, for a time, be left.

Should profuse bleeding, in consequence of the division of some of the hmmorrhoidal vessels, come on a few hours after the operation all coagula should be cleared away, the gut washed out with ice-cold water and then securely plugged either -with a piece of compressed sponge, or with a lithotomy or oesophagus tube, surrounded by lint soaked in °a solution of perchloride of iron, and pushed into the bottom of the sinuses that have been laid open, HEMORRHOIDS OR PILES. By Hemorrhoids or Piles is meant a morbid condition of the blood- vessels of the anus and lower part of the rectum, especially of the veins of the submucous or subcutaneous areolar tissue, giving rise to more or less intumescence of the part, which may or niay not be attended with a discharo-e of blood. Surgeons are commonly in the habit of classifying‘piles, accordino- as they bleed or not, into Open or Blind ; or, according as they are situated above or below the verge of the anus, into Internal pr External; the in- ternal being always within the gut, the external habitually protruding out of or around the anal apertime. The first may either bleed or not; the latter are always blind. To this division into external and internal, B. Cooper has added an intermediate variety, the Intero-External, which is partly 'within and partly without the anus. These divisions are of much practical moment, as the treatment is very materially modified according as the haemorrhoid is situated above or below the anal verge. Predisposing Causes.—We must look to the peculiar arrangement of the veins of the rectum as directly predisposing to the occurrence of piles. The lower part of the rectum and the verge of the anus are composed of a plane of muscular fibre and a muco-cutaneous surface, with an intervening stratum of dense areolar tissue. In this areolar membrane is situated a close interlacement, or net-work, of tortuous veins. The blood, from this plexus of haemon-hoidal veins, finds its way into the general system through two distinct channels. By far the greatest portion of it is carried into the inferior mesenteric vein, and thence into the vena portm, through the medium of the superior htemoiThoidal vein, -w^hich may be looked upon as the extreme radicle of the portal system ; and a certain quantity passes into the internal iliac vein through branches that accom- pany the middle and inferior hmmon-hoidal arteries. We may, therefore, look upon the hmmorrhoidal plexus as being placed midway between the portal and general venous systems, being the point indeed at which they touch ; but as belonging rather to the portal than to the systemic veins. In these aiTangements we see all the elements that would predispose to congestion, and consequent dilatation ^ of the vessels of a part. There is a large and intricate plexus of veins in which, as in all similar net-works, there is a tendency for the blood to circulate slowly at times ; the natural tendency to stasis of the blood being much increased by the dependent position of the part, and by the anatomical fact that, in conse- quence of the absence of ■\'alves in the superior htemorrhoidal vein and in the721 CAUSES OF ILEMORRIIOIDS. vessels into which it pours its contents, the Avhole pressure of the column of blood in the portal system may be brought to bear upon the hmmorrhoidal plexus. The circulation through the portal system is likewise subject to much interference in consequence of hepatic and intestinal obstruction, and in these changes the blood in the hmmorrhoidal plexus also participates ; and, were it not for the provision that exists by which this plexus may free itself to a certain extent from over-distension by its communication with the internal iliac through the medium of the middle hmmoiThoidal vein, piles would be much more fr-equent than they even now are, as a consequence of obstructed portal circulation. Another great cause of hmmorrhoidal enlargement is to be found in the want of support that the veins of this plexus experience on their mucous aspect during defecation. Situated as they are in areolar tissue, between a plane of muscular fibres on one side, and yielding mucous membrane on the other, when distended by the eonstriction w%ich they undergo during and after - the expulsion of the contents of the rectum, they necessarily give way on that side on whieh they have the least support, being forced down and elongated, together with the mucous membrane under which they ramify, and which has a natural tendency to become sbghtly everted diu’ing the act of defecation. It Avill be found that all the more immediate or excitinsr causes of O piles act by unduly increasing one or other of those natural tendencies that exist in the system, by favouring the local congestion or determination of blood, at the same time that they produce a lax 'state of fibre. A(jq exercises considerable influence in predisposing to piles. This disease is not unfrequently met with in young men of eighteen or twenty years of age ; more especially if they be of a relaxed and phlegmatic temperament with languid circulation, and be obliged to lead a more sedentary life than is natural or proper at that age. After this period, the liability to the disease diminishes until middle age is reached, when the tendency to hmmorrhoidal affections is again increased, and becomes more marked than at any former period of life, owing to the more active operation of those causes that tend to impede the return of the portal blood. Sex appears to exercise more influenee on the occurrence of hmmonhoids at particular periods of fife, than on the general liability to the disease. It certainly appears to be more frequently met with amongst men at an early age, than in young women ; but at a later period of life, so far as my obser- vation goes, the disease oceims with nearly equal frequency in both sexes. The comparative exemption of young women is readily accounted for, by the periodic discharges from the uterus preventing the congestions that might otherwse occur in the parts in its vicinity. The greater frequency in females at a later period of life is attributable not only to the tendency induced during pre.^ancy by the pressure of the gravid uterus, but also, after the cessafron of the menses, to the determination that is apt to be set up in certain organs of the female economy, and to the retardation of the pLal chTflv r"" • ® of fat and other causes; these condLons chiefly occur m women of a sanguine and plethoric habit of body. KsnJmiarn hfe with indolent habits constitutes, perhaps, the most powerful joined with want of proper and sufficient exercise. Indeed, the artificial VOL. II.722 DISEASES OF THE LARGE INTESTINE AND ANUS. and luxurious habits of the more opulent elasses, by diminishing tone at the same time that tliey occasion pletliora and a tendency to abdominal en- gorgement, exercise a considerable influence on tlie occim-ence of this disease, which is much more frequent amongst them than in persons in the humlfler walks of life. There are a number of minor conditions which are commonly looked upon as predisposing causes of this disease, though it is extremely difficult to de- termine the precise share that each has in its occun-ence. Amongst these may l)e mentioned intemperance in food and drink ; residence in warm, moist, and relaxing climates ; the use of soft and warm beds, or the opposite condition of sitting on a cold stone or damp cushion. Over-excitement of the generative organs will also occasion it. Excitistg Causes.—Amongst the exciting causes may be mentioned local irritation of any kind. Thus, in some people hard riding will bring on an attack of piles. The haUhial use of drastic imrgatives, more especially of aloes, rhubarb, &c., is well known to occasion the disease ; though it must be obser^-ed that individuals, who make habitual use of these remedies, often- labour under some of those obstructions of the abdommal viscera that have already been noticed as conducing to piles. The existence of other diseases about the rectum and anus, such as fistula, ulcer, or stricture, by inducing local congestion and irritation, may excite the disease ; so also, uterine affections and various diseases of the genito-urinarg organs may give rise to this affection. The most direct exciting cause of piles is certainly a retardation to the return of the portal blood. Any impediment to the onward current of the blood through the htemorrhoidal or mesenteric veins, the trunk or ramifications of the vena portse, exercises a marked influence oji the tendency to congestion of the hmmon-hoidal plexus. Habitual constipation ; the accumulation of hardened feculent masses in the large intestine ; the want of due secretion fr’om the mucous surface ; obstruction to the proper action of the hver, and consequent congestion of that organ ; the pressiu’e of abdominal tumom’s, or of the gravid uterus, are all active exciting causes, interfering as they do with the proper return of the portal blood. In some cases, even the existence of an obstacle to the circulation hi the systemic veins may occasion this disease ; thus it will arise fr’om the pressure of an aneurismal tumour on some of the large venous trunks vdthin the chest. Structure.—A pile, ivhether external or internal, consists essentially in the first instance of a I'aricose condition of a portion of the hmmorrhoidal plexus,. or rather, of the small veins of the submucous tissue that pour their contents • into this ; this varicose condition, becoming prominently developed at certain i points, gives rise to small knots or tumours. A pile in this state is quite soft: and compressible, and can readily be emptied by pressime ; and when cut into,. it will be found to be composed of one or more cells filled with blood, andi surrounded by areolar tissue. The appearance of cells is, however, deceptive,. and is occasioned by a section of the sacculated and dilated veins that enter, into the composition of the tumour. After the piles have existed for some little time, or after they haA'e once become inflamed, the tissues that entei into their composition undergo modifications that induce corresponding altcia- tions in the cliaracter of the tumour. The coats of the veins become thickened,723 EXTERNA L IIjEMORRIIOIBS. tlieir collnlai- dilatations avo filled with coagulated blood ; the investing areolar tissue is hypertrophied or thickened by plastic deposit ; and, on being cut into, the pile is seen to bo composed of a spongy kind of tissue filled with blood. External piles, when examined after removal, often resemble in structure a mass of hypertrophied areolar tissue, infiltrated with plastic matter, in vdiich a number of small '\'essels of uniform character ramify, but without any ai^pearance of cells. Internal piles, on the contrary, contain more of the venous, and less of the areolar element. They are also commonly fm-nished Avith a small central artery, Avhich is apt to bleed freely, or even dangerously, if the tumour be cut across; hence, provided they are not clogged with coagulated blood, they may readily be injected from the inferior mesenteric artciy. Ill studying the structure of hmmoiThoids, it is of importance to observe that they occur under tivo different forms : one in which there are distinct tumours, within or external to the anus, and another in which there is merely a varicose condition of the veins of this region, without distinct intumescence. In those cases in Avhich there is merely a general varicose state of the veins of the submucous areolar tissue of the anus, without any distinct tumour springing above the lei’cl of the membrane, it will be found that the smaller branches of the hcemoiThoidal plexus, and the small twigs that enter these fiom the submucous areolar tissue, have undergone varicose dilatation, being apparently gi-eatly increased in number, as well as in size. The mucous membrane is of a deep mulberry or port-wine colour, and becomes everted after each motion. There is usually some mucous secretion about the anus, rendering the part moist: and the patient complains at times of Aveight and of bearing doAvn, Avith pains either in the part itself, in the sacro-lumbar region, or m the thighs. The motions, more especially if hard, are streaked Anth blood, and more or less of this fiuid drops in a rapid manner after the passage of the feces. There is seldom much blood lost; but at times there IS an exacerbation of all these symptoms, and the hemorrhage, as AviU more particularly be mentioned hereafter, may become very abundant. This con- dition of the mucous membrane may precede, and is frequently found to accom- pany the true pile, whether external or internal, and may be looked upon as constituting the first stage of this disease. If this state of things be aUowed to continue unrelieved, the tendency to congestion increases ; more and more micous3r protruded after defecation ; the sub- one of piXl aT Before arotlTnTTfi 1T muco-cutaneous tissue. aT^nZZ th usually constitute longitudinal folds W vJvT “■ from a centre.

AVhcn of small size and recent formation, external piles do not m general give rise to much distress, but merely some local heat, pricking, and Itching, with a sense of fulness after defecation ; but when of largo size’ and inflamed or irritated, they may occasion very acute suffering. There is not only deeply seated, dull, aching and throbbing paiir in the pile itself, but this shoots up the side of the rectum, through the perinaeum, and into the nates, and is much increased when the patient stands or walks. After a few days these symptoms subside ; suppm’ation either taking place in the pile, or the blood contained in it coagulating. The parts are, however, left in a thickened and indurated state, and do not really resume their former soft and flaccid condition, effusion of plastic matter taking place into the areolar tissue, and the contained blood perhaps coagulating, so that the tumour can no longer be emptied by pressure, assuming the form of a broad, rounded, or indurated mass. Internal Piles.—When the pile is situated altogether within the verge of the anus, it is called internal; of these there are two principal varieties, the Longitudinal and the Globular. The Longitudinal, or, as it is sometimes called, the Fleshy pile, is generally met mth about an inch or two up the rectum. It is spongy, elastic, firm, or tough, of a dark reddish or dusky brown tint, taperiug upwards from a broad base. It seldom bleeds or varies much in size ; between the piles are found small curtains, valves, or folds of mucous membrane, forming sacculi or pouches, with their concavities looking upwards. These sacculi are apt to become distended and pressed downwards by the ffeces, especially if the motions be hard and the bowels have been constipated, thus giving rise to a tendency to prolapsus. When the hsemoiThoid assumes a Globular form, it constitutes the ordinary bleeding pile. It may be situated on a broad base ; or, as not unfrequently happens, its point of attachment to the mucous membrane becoming elongated, it assumes a pedunculated shape, hanging downwards into the cavity of the rectum. It is of a dark bluish colour, and numerous small vessels of a brighter hue than the body of the pile may be seen ramifying on the mucous membrane investing it. Its surface is at first smooth and shining, and may continue so throughout, being covered vdth a thin and dehcate prolongation of the lining membrane of the gut. Not unfrequently, however, superficial ulceration takes place, and then it has a granulated strawberiy-hke appearance. Synyptoms.—Internal piles are usually attended by a sensation of heat, itching, pricking, or smarting about the anus, and a feeling as if there were a foreign body within the gut. After defecation these sensations are increased, and are often accompanied by a bearing down, as if the bowel wore not emptied of its contents, that is peculiarly distressing and sickening. This is occasioned by the piles, or the elongated and condensed mucous membrane to Avhich they are attached, being protruded during the expulsion of the fieces, and not retiu’ning sufficiently quickly, being grasped by the sphincter ani and constricted by it. This feeling of discomfort and bearing down is much increased, if the patient stand or walk much after having had a stool, or if he have a confined state of the bowels. If this state of things be not jKopcrly attended to, the symptoms become increased in severity; the bearing-dounniEMORRlIAGE FROM PILES. 725 sensation amounts to true tenesmus, and the act of defecation becomes so painful that the patient defers it as long as possible, and then when it does take place in consequence of the accumulation of the excreta and their indurated character, the suffering is much increased. Internal piles now nsuaUy make their appearance, if they have not existed before ; the mucous membrane of the rectum becomes prolapsed, and an increased secretion of thin mucus takes place from the orifice of the gut, moistening the part and soiling the patient s linen. Iiritation in the neighbouring organs is frequently set up; occasionally to so great an extent as to mask the original complaint, the patient referring his principal pain and discomfort to these sympathetic disturbances. There is often a dull aching fixed pain at the lower part of the lumbar spine, and more frequently opposite the sacrum or the sacro-iliac articulation on either side ; this is sometimes very severe, perhaps down the thigh, or round the groins ; iiTitability of the testicles may come on, or irritation about the neck of the bladder, causing frequent desire to micturate, and increasing the patient s sufferings by the straining that takes place. The general health now suffers, the patient may become emaciated, and the countenance often presents a pecu- liarly anxious, drawn, and careworn look. The symptom, however, that first of aU and most prominently fixes the patient’s attention, is Haemorrhage. This varies greatly in quantity ; at first there may merely be a few drops falling after the passage of a motion, or the cylinder of fmces may be stained on one side by a streak or spots of blood, or the bleeding may amount to several oimces or even pints. When moderate in quantity, it often affords relief to the other local symptoms, and seldom proves injiu-ious fr-om the quantity lost at one time; but, if profuse, and occiuTing at short intervals, its effects on the constitution may be alarming. The hmmon’hoidal flux is connected with, and in the great majority of cases dependent upon, the existence of distinct hmmorrhoidal tumoiu’s. Occasionally, however, it appears to occim when there is no distinct separate tumour pro- i jecting above the surface of the membrane ; but in these cases there is general intumescence and congestion of the whole of the mucous membrane of the lower part of the rectum, from which the blood exudes in drops, or it may even spirt in a distinct jet from the open mouth of a blood-vessel. It is fi’equently ushered in by an exacerbation of those symptoms that commonly accompany piles, such as a sensation of fulness, weight, and tension about the parts. But the symptoms that precede its occurrence are often much more imperfectly marked than is usually stated, and are frequently absent altogether. The discharge of blood may be periodical, occurring every mouth, or at intervals of two, three, or six months ; and it may be remittent or inter- mittent. When once it has set in, it usually continues from thrce to six days, increasing in quantity up to the third or fourth day, aud then lessening. When moderate in quantity and short in duration, it is often a source of relief to the patient; but if a very large quantity be lost at one time, or if it continue for too long a period, it becomes a source of great debility ; more harm is usually done to the patient by its long continuance, than by its excessive quantity at any one time. The patient may become much debilitated726 DISEASES OF THE LARGE INTESTINE AND ANUS. and antemic ; nervous headaclics, pallor, palpitations, and syncope may result. In some cases this discharge is of service, acting as a derivative, and prevent- ing disease from falling on more important parts ; it has especially been looked upon as, and doubtless is in many cases, a safeguard from apoplexy and visceral congestions and obstructions, particularly when it occurs in ijlethoric and corpulent persons who habitually live too highly. In other cases it may be considered as critical; especially when it occurs about the cessation of the menstrual period. But, as a rule, the continued loss of blood from piles is undoubtedly injurious to the patient’s constitution. Hmmorrhage from piles is sometimes vicarious with, and at other times arrests, the menstrual flow. In a case, which I attended with Gaivod, the patient had suffered from the hasmorrhoidal flux and piles frem the ago of puberty. She menstruated for the first time when thirty-seven years old ; up to that period the hmmorrhoidal discharge had occurred abrmdantly at monthly intervals. After the late establishment of the menstrual function, the ]Diles continued to bleed, but less regularly, and she became anemic, emaciated, and debilitated to the last degree. When she was forty-four years of age, I saw her for the first time ; the piles, which were very large and vascular, were ligatured, and she made a most perfect recovery in general health. The colour of the blood is most generally florid, as if it came from the small arteries or capillaries of the part rather than from the veins. It would appear that, in consequence of the over-distended and varicose condition of the veins of the part, the onward flow through the arteries and capillaries leading to them is obstructed ; and that, in consequence of the accumulated pressiue on those vessels, their parietes give Avay, allowing the florid blood to escape from the arteries. Very commonly the internal piles, when brought down, present a some- what granular sm’face, in consequence of ulceration haAung taken place, and the whole surface Avill be seen to exude blood in drops. In other instances, the blood appears to come from a cavity in one side of the hemor- rhoid, as if rupture had occurred from over-distension at that part. Occa- sionally, however, the flow' of blood is so rapid and copious that it cannot be supposed to come from exudation, but would appear to depend on ruptiue of the vessels of the part. The hemorrhoidal flux may be accompanied by, or alternate with, a thin glairy mucous discharge from the rectum and diseased structiues ; this would appear to be nothing more than excessive secretion from the membrane, in consequence of the irritation set up by the presence of the piles ; it is seldom in sufficient quantity to produce much annoyance, or to be of much moment to the patient. _ . •. v Complications.—Piles are not uncommonly compheated with othei diseases of the rectum, such as fissures, fistula, or prolapsus. When connected with fissure, the hmmorrhoid often, as Syme has remai-ked, assumes a peculiar form and appearance, presenting itself as a small red-colomed body, like a pea in size, firm, and seated at the base of the fissure, which it often conceals ; to a practised eye, however, the presence of a pile of this peculiar colour and shape is sufficient to indicate the existence of the fissure.DIAGNOSIS OF UjEMOERIIOIDAL TUMOURS. 72? In that form of fistula in which the aperture is near the anus, one or more external piles of small size are often found situated at the orifice of the fistida; and prolapsus rarely, if ever, is met with in adults, without the simultaneous occuiTcnce of piles. a i i Tkujuxatioks.—Hiemorrhoidal tumours may terminate by bubsiaence, Coagulation, Suppuration, or Sphacelus. Subsidence.—Complete subsidence of the pile can only take place when the disease is of recent occurrence. AVhen of long standing, and after it has been exposed to successive attacks of inflammation and turgescence, it never subsides completely ; and the areolar tissue and the muco-cutaneous structures, becoming hypertrophied, form elongated pendulous flaps around the margin of the anus. Coagulation of the contents of the pile is the result of inflammation ha^^ng• taken place in it, and probably terminating in plastic effusion by which the vessels leading fiom it are obstructed. When it takes place, the tumom, after more or less active inflammation, becomes hard, incompressible, and indolent, peimanent in size, and of a piu’plish or plum colom*. The coagulum thus formed may remain persistent, may excite suppiu’ation, or may be absorbed, the hypertrophied tissues forming one of the usual anal folds. In some rai’e instances, the coagula may become converted into structm’es resembling phlebolithes. Coagulation more frequently takes place in external than in internal piles, owing to the great impediment to the return of the blood from them, and to theu’ greater liability to inflammation, their exposed situation leading them to be braised or otherwise injured. "When it occims in internal piles, it most commonly affects those that are of a columnar or longitudinal shape, and least frequently the globular variety. Suppuration is not an uncommon termination, if acute inflammation have been set up in internal piles, more especially in those that have previously been coagulated. When the abscess is discharged, small coagula escape with its contents, the cavity gTanulates, and becomes obliterated, and the pile is cured. Sphacelus.—In some cases, when there is much elongation of the mucous membrane from which the pile springs, prolapsus of that membrane and of the piles may take place ; and, this being grasped after it has descended by the contraction of the sphincter, the same effect may be produced as if a ligature were applied. The tumom’ becomes much swollen, hard, livid, and tense ; there are much constitutional distiu’bance and restlessness ; but after a few days the part that is constricted sloughs and drops oft!, and all the symptoms arc relieved. Diagnosis.—The diagnosis must be regarded in two points of view ;— 1, as concerns the Hctimorrhoidal Tumours; and 2, with reference to the Hcomorrhoidal Flux. 1. Haemorrlioidal Tumours must be diagnosed ft’om prolapsus ani, polypus of the rectum, and condylomata about the anus. From prolapsus the diagnosis is not always easy ; indeed, the two diseases are so generally associated, that it is of little mornent to attempt it. In true prolapsus, ocular examination will suffice to distinguish the membranous wall of the intestine, forming a728 DISEASES OF THE LARGE INTESTINE AND ANUS. smooth, rounded, snid somcAvlmt lobulated annular protuberance, irom the isolated tumours of piles. In polypus, the history of the case, the pedunculated and solitary character of the tumom-, its large size, and comparatively slight tendency to periodical haimorrhage, will enable the Surgeon to make the diagnosis. From condyloniata the diagnosis is easy ; the soft, flat, mucous, and wart-like character of these gTowths, their history, and their occurrence at other points, as the perina3um, scrotum, vulva, and buttocks, udll enable the Surgeon to distinguish them without any difficulty. 2. The Hsemorrhoidal Flux must be distinguished from other intestinal haemorrhages. This may be done by attention to the chai'acter of the blood, which will enable us in many cases to determine its source. When it comes fr’om piles it is h'quid, of a more or less florid colour ; and not unfrequently is quite bright, staining or coating the faeces rather than being mixed up -with them. When, on the contrary, the blood is poured out at some higher point in the intestinal canal than the usual seat of haemorrhoids, it is of a dark, sooty character, mixed up with hquid faeces either in a diffused form or in small black coagula, and no fr’esh or bright blood will be visible. Digital exploration of the rectum in cases of piles, and the presence of symptoms indicating the existence of mischief at a higher part of the intestine than the anus in cases of melmna, will also serve to point to the seat of the flux. Treatment.—In conducting the treatment of a case of piles, that Sm-geon will succeed best who looks upon the disease not as a local affection, merely requiring manual interference, but as a symptom, or rather an effect, of remote visceral obstruction and disease, the removal of which may alone be sufficient to accomplish the cui’e, without the necessity of any local interference ; or, should it be thought necessary to have recourse to operative procedure, this must be made secondary to the removal of those conditions that have primarily occa- sioned the congestion and dilatation of the ha3morrhoidal v^essels. The treat- ment of piles, therefore, must be considered, 1, as regards the Eemoval of these Constitutional Conditions or Visceral Obstructions that occasion the disease, together with any Topical Applications that maybe considered necessary ; and, 2, with reference to the Operative Procedures that may be required for the removal of the affection. ]. The Constitutional Management of piles necessarily varies consider- ably according to the condition of the patient in whom they occur, and the vdsceral obstruction to which they may be referrable. Thus, when they occiu in debilitated persons, apparently from relaxation of the vessels, most benefit will be derived from a mild tonic and nutritious plan, at the same time that the bowels are kept regular by some of the aperients that will immediately be mentioned. In these cases, also, much advantage is often obtained by the administration of the confection of black pepper, which acts as a useful local stimulant to the vessels of the rectum. In the great majority of instances, however, more particularly when ocemuing about the middle period of life, piles are connected with a plethoric state of system, and obstruction of the ab- dominal viscera. In these circumstances, our eftbrts should be directed to the reduction of the plethoric condition, by putting the patient upon a proper regimen, prohibiting the use of stimulants, and lessening the_ quantity ot animal food that he is in the habit of taking. When piles arise from729 LOCAL TREATMENT OF FILES. m-essm-e ofa >n-avicl uterus or other abdominal tumour, little can be done; except, by local palliati^■es and mild aperients, to moderate the mcoiiTemence hfijf mcr'of piles, but more particularly in those arising fi-om hepatic obstruction, mild aperients are of essential service ; by remoYing- feculent accu- mulations and establishing a free secretion from the intestinal surface, they tend materially to prevent congestion of the portal system. At the same tune, ih-astic puro-atfves of all kinds should carefully be avoided. The most useful aperients arc the electuary of senna, sulphur, and castor-oil ; one or other 0 which should be taken regularly tivice or thrice a week at bed-time, in as smaU a quantity as will be sufficient to keep the bowels free. In many cases, the con- fection of senna may advantageously be given in combination with precipitated sulphur and the bitartratc of potash, equal parts of each of these being made into a mass ivith twice their quantity of the confection and a little syrup ; of this electuary a dessert-spoonful may lie taken every night or every second night. If there be a relaxed condition of the rectum and anus conjoined vuth the piles, as not unfrequently happens in old as well as in young people, the- administration of an electuary composed of eq^ual parts of the confections of senna and of black pepper, or of cubebs, viU be found very useful. ^ In fact, in aU cases in which the black pepper is administered, an aperient should be given from time to time, to prevent its accumulation in the large- intestine. When the liver is much obstructed, the treatment should be specially directed to the relief of this organ; with this view, a course of Plummer’s pill, followed by taraxacum, and, in relaxed constitutions, the mineral acids, will be found especially serviceable, at the same time that the bowels are kept free by gentle aperients. The habitual use of lavements, consisting either of soap and water or thin gi-uel, will be found advantageous in many cases of piles, though in some they appear to iiTitate, and rather to increase the disease. When the piles occur in relaxed constitutions, the lavement should be used cold ; but when the patient is of full habit of body, a tepid one will usually be found to agree best. In the general management of piles, it need scarcely be observed that any habits which favour the disease should be sedulously avoided. The Local Treatment of piles is of considerable importance. The parts should be regularly sponged with cold Avater, morning and evening. If there be much relaxation, and the piles be internal, benefit may result fr’om the employnrent of some astringent injection, such as a very Aveak solution of the sulphate of iron, or of the tincture of the sesquichloride—a grain of the first or ten drops of the second, to an ounce of Avater ; of this about tAvo ounces may be injected every night and left in the rectum. The application of an astringent ointment, such as the unguentum gaUae compositum, or the employ- ment of the anodyne and astringent suppository already recommended, will be attended Avith much benefit. If the piles become inflamed, the patient should keep his bed, and leeches should be freely applied around but not upon the tumours. Tepid lotions, poultices, and poppy fomentations, must be assiduously used, a very spare diet enjoined, and the IjoAvels opened by mild saline aperients. If a coagulum form in an external pile, as the result of inflammation, the tumour should be laid.DISEASES OF THE LAliOE INTESTINE ANJJ ANUS. 730 open with a lancet, and its contents citlier sc|ucezed, or turned out with the flat end of a director. ]f abscess form, it must be punctured in the usual way, and the part afterwards poulticed. Should strangulation of the piles take place, the protruded swelling must be returned by gentle steady pressure, and the part afterwards well poulticed. 2. Operation, ihe means above indicated are usually sutticient in ordinary cases ot jnles ; but it the disease attain an inconvenient size, giving rise to general irritation and local uneasiness, or if the abundance of the hEemorrhage be such as seriously to interfere with the health of the patient, it will become necessary at last to have recourse to operati\'e interference, with a view of removing the diseased structiu’es. No operation should ever be undertaken whilst the pile is in an inflamed state, lest unhealthy inflammatory action to an undue extent be set up in the part ; it is also Avell to get the patient’s health into a good state, as erysipelas may otherwise follow the operation ; and before proceeding to perform it, care should be taken that the bowels have been well opened. There are three plans of treatment adopted by Surgeons for the removal of piles; y\z., the excision of the tumoiu', its strangulation by ligatm’e, or destruc- tion by caustics. These methods of treatment should not be employed indis- criminately. The first is alone applicable to external piles ; the last two may be adopted in the internal form of the disease. Excision.—The removal of external piles is readily effected. The tumom’ should be seized with a vulsellum or hook, di’awn forwards, and snipped off with a pair of knife-edged scissors, curved upon the flat. At the same time when the external piles are removed in this way, any pendulous flaps of skin in their vicinity should be excised, lest they become irritated, and constitute the basis of a fresh pile. After the excision of external piles, there is usually but trifling hmmorrhage, which may readily be arrested by the application of cold lint, or a pad and T-bandage ; should any small artery bleed, it may be pinched, and the hmmorrhage thus stopped. The hEemorrhage attendant on this little operation is sometimes rather profuse. Ligature.—Internal piles are usually removed by the ligatm’e ; in fact, it may be laid down as a rule in sm’gery, that all external piles should be cut off and all internal piles tied. The reason of this difference in the practice to be adopted, according as the pile is situated above or below the margin of the anus, is the liability to hEemorrhage in the one case, but not in the other. The bleeding that follows the excision of an external pile is not only small in quantity, but may readily be arrested by cold or pressm-e. With internal piles, however, it is different ; these tumom’s are not oidy more vascidar, being often fed by a large centrEil arterial twig, but are deeply seated, and do not readily admit of the application of means for the arrest of the flow of blood from them. So difficult is it to stop the bleeding fr-om an internal pile in spme cases, that patients have actually lost their lives from this cause after its excision, even in the hands of some of the most distinguished Surgeons. The excision of internal piles has consequently been very properly abandoned. The Operation for the Ligature of Internal Piles mExy most conveniently be conducted in the foUowing manner. The patient, having had^ his bowels cleared out by a dose of castor-oil on the day preceding that fixed for the Iligature of internal piles. 73^ Fig. 702.- Ring Foi'ceps.

AVhen all is ready, ho slio'uld he laid on the bed on his left side noth the Sur^reon then seizes the most prominent pile with a hook, vulseilum, ring-forceps (Fig. 702), draws it well for- J^v, wards, and ties its base as tightly as pos- sible with a thin whipcord ligatiu'c. The ring-forceps may be tightened by a clip or by°a strong India-rubber ring on the shanks, which closes them if drawn down to the handles. He does the same to one pile after the other, until all that can be met with have been strangulated in this way. In some cases the pile is so broad at the base, that the ligature will not include it. In such cases some Surgeons employ transfixion ; this may usually be done readily enough by means of a nasvus- needle, or by the instrument represented in the annexed drawing (Fig. 703), Bushe’s Needle, which consists of a steel shank fixed in an ivory handle, and having its free end perforated for the reception of a needle-eye near its point. In this instrument not only is the angle formed by the needle and the shank a very convenient one for passing a ligatine through a pile inside the anus, but more particularly, as the needle can be detached, it may, as soon as it is carried across the base of tlie tumour, be separated and so withdrawn more readdy than it otherwise could. Transfixion of the pile and its ligature in two halves is, however, a very dangerous proce- dure, and should never be had recourse to if it can possibly be avoided. The danger of this operation consists in the possibility of a hfemorrhoidal vein being transfixed, and the two halves then tied separately. In this Avay the vessel is left open and cannot collapse, and the risk of direct septic absorption becomes very gi-eat. Transfixion may usually be avoided when the pile is large and round, by snipping through the cutaneous portion by means of cinved scissors, thus leaving a deep groove for the reception of the ligature, which then constricts only the substance and mucous sinface of the haemorrhoid. If the pile be longitudinal, it may be deeply notched with scissors in a direction upwards nt its lower attachment, at the line of junction between the skin and mucous membrane, and the ligature tied in the groove thus formed. In Avhatever Avay the ligatures arc applied, care should be taken that they are tied as tightly as possible, so that the piles may be effectually strangled at once ; as in this way they separate much more readily, and with far less pain to the patient than if loosely tied. When all the tumours requiring ligature have been tied, the ends of the threads must be cut off close, and the strangulated mass pushed If there be any external piles, these must now be cut back into the bowel.732 DISEASES OF THE LARGE INTESTINE AND ANUS. off; for, unless this be done, they become irritated, swollen, and inflamed by the presence of the ligatures, and constitute a source of mnch distress. The patient must now retnrn to bed, and shonld keep the recumbent posture until the ligatures separate, which usually happens from the sixth to the eighth day, when an ulcerated surface Avill be left, which, however, speedily closes and contracts. In some cases this process may be facilitated by the application of the nitrate of silver through a speculum ani. On the second day after the operation, the bowels may be opened with a dose of castor-oil. In the C(ft(i7'-treaiment of the case, care must be taken to prevent the recur- rence of those causes that gave rise to the affection in the first instance. After piles ha's e been tied, more particularly if they be seated towards the anterior part of the rectum, there is frequently great irritation set up about the neck of the bladder, so that the patient experiences difficulty in passing his urine, and sometimes suffers from complete retention ; a warm hip-bath, and a full dose of hyoscyamus and nitrous ether, will usually relieve this, and enable the urine to pass. In some cases, when the external piles are very large and vascular, and the patient debilitated, the ordinary rule of cutting them off may advantageously be deviated from, and a combination of the treatment by excision and hgature be adopted. In such cases an incision may be made through the integuments merely, and then the piles tied in the course of the groove thus formed. By these means the pain and constitutional disturbance- consequent on the inclusion of a portion of the integument in the ligatiu’e are avoided, at the same time that the risk of haemorrhage is not inciuTed. The treatment of piles by ligature is not altogether devoid of danger in per- sons of broken constitution. I -have more than once known death from pyaemia result in these cases. Smith's Operation.—Piles may be removed with but little fear of haemonhage by the method introduced by H. Smith, which is as follows. The pile is brought Fig. 704.—Smitii’s Clamp. doAvn and seized in a clamp (Fig. 701), fixed by a feAV tums of the screw, and cut off not too close to the clamp. The cut surface is then seared Avith a cau- terising iron, by which haemorrhage is prevented and cicatrisation facilitated. Th^ Removal of Piles by the Galvanic Ecraseur may easily and safely be effected, the pile being draAvn down with ring-forceps, and its base con- stricted by the platinum wire of the feraseur, which, being tightened, cuts off the projecting mass very readily. This treatment is, however, only to be adopted for internal piles. In them, it has the great advantage of preventing all htemorrhage by the searing of the cut surface by the hot wire ; and the contraction of the resulting cicatrix after the separation of the slough, tends still further to obliterate all dilated htemon-hoidal vessels. _ Caustics.—In certain kinds of internal piles, the application of nitric acuiFit 705 — Speculum Aui. DANGERS ATTENDING REMOVAL OF PILES. 733 1 1 vPPnmraeiK'led by Houston of Dublin and II. Lee, and may certainly ndvantao-consly be adopted. It must not, however, be applied to the external m* to tiio intcro-extemal pile, as it will pvoduce extreme m-itation , nor can i l.e looked upon as a substituto for tbe ligature in intenial niles o-cnerally. It is especially in the granular pile, having an ulcerated surface, that this mode of treatment is iisefu ; as in these cases it appears, by destroying a portion of the raucous membrane, not only to cure the pile to which it is aiiiilied, but, by producing an ulcer, to give rise to a cmatrix, which by contracting, consolidates the parts in its vicinity, and so lessens the relaxed state of the rectiim, which favours the haimon'hoidal tendency. The acid may conveniently be applied tlu-ough a speculum ani, having an aperture on one side (Fig. 705). This should be introduced well oiled, until the pile projects through the opening in it, when it must be fi’eely rubbed \Hth a piece of stick, or a glass rod, oi brush, dipped in the acid ; the sm-face is then immediately iviped with a piece of lint saturated with prepared chalk and water, and the instrument removed. Or the gilt chp (Fig. 706) may be used, so as to effectually protect the neigh- bouring parts from the action of the acid. A thin slough separates, leaving a raw siu’face, which gradually cicatrises and contracts. The application of the acid occasions but little pain when fairly made within the rectum ; but if a drop of it acci- dentally come into contact with the muco-cutaneous surface, a vast deal of irritation and inflammation is excited. This plan of treatment, though useful in particular forms of pile, as ivhen the tumour is granular or flat, so as not to allow ready removal by the ligature, should not be practised when the ligature can be employed, as it is by no means so certain a mode of treatment. It caimot be considered altogether devoid of risk ; for I have known one instance in which fatal erysipelas followed the cauterisation of piles with nitric acid. Dangers attending Operation for Piles.—The operation for the removal of piles may be attended by three sources of danger. After excision, and even the application of the ligature or of nitric acid, erysipelas may develop. If the objectionable practice of transfixing the pile by the needle be followed, and it be tied in two separate parts, a hfemorrhoidal vein may thus be opened, and its sides held apart by the action of the ligatures, and thus a tendency to direct pyaemic infection be induced ; and lastly, I have seen a kind of erysipe- latous colitis induced, leading to profuse muco-purulent discharge and high fever. I have also in one case seen pelvic cellutitis set up. But all these various secondary affections—erysipelas, pyaemia, colitis, and cellulitis—are happily of rare oecun’ence. A permanently moist condition of the skin around the anus is not un- frequent, as the result of portal congestion or a hmmorrhoidal tendency. It is best removed by the habitual use of aperient salines, or of aperient mineral waters, as those of Pullna or Friedrichshall. Fig. 705.—Gilt Clip.734 diseases of the LARGE INTESTINE AND ANUS. Pruritus Ani is often an extremely troublesome affection, the iteliing and general irritation about the anus being almost unbearable, fn many instances it appears to be a true prurigo of this part; in other cases it seems to be connected with the indtation of external piles, worms, or some similar affec- tion. The Treatment must in a great measure have reference to the cause. If there be an external pile, the removal of it, or if worms, their expulsion, will probably ciu-e the disease. If it arise from prurigo, it will require some special treatment. In some cases the arsenical preparations -will be found useful, to- gether with the local application of chlorinated lotions, or those containing hydrocyanic acid. “ PROLAPSUS ANI. Prolapsus Ani consists in a protrusion of the mucous membrane of the rectum through the anal orifice ; the areolar tissue that lies underneath it being also in the majority of instances much thickened and elongated. In the ordinary prolapsus, the muscular structures of the gut are not protruded ; yet occasionally the muscular coat descends with the mucous membrane, an invagination of the howel taking place, which constitutes a far more serious condition than the ordinary prolapsus. Causes.—Prolapsus not unfrequently ocem-s in children, especially those who are feeble, or who suffer from much irritation of the digestive or urinary organs. In weakly persons generally there is a natural tendency to prolapsus ; the shght protrusion of the mucous membrane which takes place during defe- cation being increased by any constitutional condition that gives rise to atony of the muscular system, especially if irritation of the intestinal mucous mem- brane be conjoined with this, as in dysentery, chronic dian’hoea, &c. So again, the habitual constipation, often occurring in persons of a relaxed habit of body, apparently proceeding fi’om want of power in the rectum to expel its contents, and requiring constant straining at stool, predisposes to this affection. It is especially common in those who labom* under stricture, stone, or any other disease about the urinary organs that require a considerable effort to be made in expelling the contents of the bladder. In persons whose constitution has been relaxed by a long residence in India, this disease also frequently occins. In other cases, and indeed most usually, the prolapsus is associated with piles, the weight and dragging of the hasmorrhoid drawing down the mucous mem- brane 'with it. This is especially apt to happen, when there is general haemorrhoidal tendency about the anus. In fact, the causes of prolapsus may be summed up under three heads ; 1. Simple relaxation of tissue, such as is met with in children and in weakly persons ; 2. Sympathetic irritation, as in chronic tenesmus, stone in the bladder, &c.; 3. A htemorrhoidal or polypoid condition of the mucous membrane of the rectum. Diagnosis.—Prolapsus is readily recognised. It consists in the protrusion of a ring of mucous membrane of a red or purphsh colour, and having a somewhat turgid look, rather lobulated in shape, and varying in size from half a walnut to a small orange (Fig. 707). The mucous membrane covering this ring will be found to be continuous with that investing the sphincter, and this constitutes the mark of distinction between ordinary prolapsus and invagina- tion of the whole thickness of the gut; for in the latter affection, which is735 treatment of e no lapsus ani. , 1 r.vp Hiorc is a deep and distincfc sulcns between the protrusion and extremely laie, tlieie is a t i is when the protrusion is stricture. In chronic cases, the anal aperture appears to be per- manently relaxed ; and, on intio- ducing the fing'ei’ into it, it is found to be widened and iveak- ened. The folds of skin in its neighbourhood are relaxed and elongated, radiating from it as from a centre; they are commonly bluish, soft, somewhat swollen, and pendulous, and often the seat of a good deal of irritation. The protrusion at first occurs only after defecation, and then readily goes back of itself, or is reduced by steady pressiu’e upon it; after a time, however, it AviU come down at other periods ; thus it may protrude after riding, walking, or even standing, and is returned noth much difficulty. Strangulation of the prolapsus may occasionally occur, if it be allowed to protrade for a considerable length of time ynthout a proper attempt being made to push it back. It then becomes swollen and livid, with great pain and tenesmus, discharges a fetid ill-conditioned pus, and may eventually fall into a sloughy state, and thus separating, undergo a spontaneous cure. There is a form of prolapsus that arises from complete atony of the levator and sphincter ani muscles. Tor this nothing can advantageously be done by operation. Palliation by simple support is the sole treatment. Treatveent.—The treatment of prolapsus may be said to be palliative and curative. The Palliative Treatment consists in the first place in reducing the tumour when protruded. This, in ordinary circumstances, the patient does for himself; but, if it become congested, it requires the help of the Siu’geon to put it back. This may occasionally be readily done by laying the patient on his side, or making him lean over the back of a chafr ; and then greasing the mass "with some oil, seizing it with a soft towel, and gradually compressing it, Avorking it back. It may be kept np by Avearing a belt Avith a pad and elastic support. Olive-shaped pewter pessaries are occasionally employed, with the vicAv of preventing the protrusion ; but I have never seen them of any service, the sphincter being usually too relaxed to keep them up, and their pressure appearing to excite irritation. The regulation of the boAvels is as important in prolapsus as in piles. It is usually best done by tlie administration of those laxatives that have been recommended for the latter disease. It is a good plan in prolapsus to get the patient to have his daily motion at bed-time instead of at the usual hour in the morning ; the recumbent position and the uniform temperature of the l)cd preventing the imtation of the sphincter and spasm of the anal muscles that commonly continue for some time after the reduction of the prolapsus,736 DISEASES OF THE LARGE INTESTINE AND ANUS. and which are a source of great discomfort when occurring in the early part of the day. Curative Treatment.—The relaxation of the mucous membrane of the rectum that essentially constitutes prolapsus may often be obviated by astrin- gent injections or suppositories. The best injection is that of the sulphate of iron, in the strength of from one to three grains in an ounce of water, thrown up in small quantities sufficient for the bowel to retain. In children, injections •of this kind, conjoined with regulation of the bowels by mild aperients, the administration of a moderate quantity of unstimulating food, and afterwards the employment of tonics will commonly remove the disease, unless it arise from stone in the bladder, or some other affection inducing much and con- tinued straining. In mild cases of prolapsus in adults, conjoined ^vith a relaxed state of the mucous membrane of the rectum and relaxation of the sphincter, the use of the iron injection vdll be found particularly beneficial, at the same time that the action of the bowels is regulated by means of an electuary taken in the morning or at night. By thus giving tone to the bowel, at the same time that constipation is prevented, the disease Avill ■occasionally undergo a cure, provided it be not associated with any affection in other organs. In those cases in which the prolapsus is haemorrhoidal or polypoid, the pro- trusion being dragged down by the weight and strain of the pile or polypus, the same treatment must be adopted as has been recommended for the latter disease ; and usually, after the ligatm’e and removal of the pile or polypus, the prolapsus will be cured. In slight cases of prolapsus, in which the disease appears rather to be owing to the relaxation of the sphincter and of the tissues external to it, the muco-cutaneous integument hanging in loose and pendulous folds around the anus, considerable benefit will commonly result from snipping of these pendulous fiaps of skin ; the cut surface that is left cicatrising, and by its contraction bracing up the part, and thus preventing its fiuther pro- trusion. These pendulous fiaps are best removed in a direction radiating from the anal orifice, with curved knife-edged scissors. When the prolapsus is considerable, and the ordinary palliative treatment after a proper trial fails in effecting a ciue, it will be necessary to remove the protruded mucous membrane by operation. This should always be done by the application of the hgatiue ; excision, though easy, being objectionable in this as in the case of piles, on account of the danger ft’om hasmoirhage. Application of Ligature.—The patient ha^dng had the bowels freely opened on the joreceding day, and an enema of tepid water on the morning of operation, should be directed to sit over a pan of hot water, in order to make the prolapsus descend ; it may then be seized with a pair of bioad-ended forceps, such as are represented in Fig. 703, and drawn well forwards. ^ The base must next be firmly tied with a strong piece of whipcord, and a similar process repeated on the opposite side of the anus. ^ Should there be any difficidty on account of the shape of the protrusion in hgatiuing the base firmly, this may be obviated by transfixing it with a hEcmorrhoidal needle, and tying it on each side. I think, however, that it is better, if possible, to avoid doing this. The ends of the ligatiue must then be cut short, the whole protrusion returned into the bowel, the external flaps of skin cut o , amINVAGINATION OF THE RECTUM. 737 an opiate pill administered, so as to an-est all peristaltic action for a fen’ days. Should the ulcerated surhice show any difficulty in healing, it must he touched with the nitrate of silver. This operation always leaves a per- manent cure. The ligature of prolapsus, like that of internal piles, is not very painfu, and for it chlorofoim need not be administered ; indeed, it is, perhaps, better that it should not be given, as the protrusion is apt to slip up under its in- fluence, the patient not being able to exercise the proper expulsive efforts. Rut, as the excision of the external flaps and piles is attended by very sharj) suHering, it is as well to administer the anaesthetic at the time when they are being removed. Should a prolapsus become strangulated, it would be necessary to try to reduce it through the sphincter by the employment of the taxis ; if this caimot readily be accomplished, free incisions may be made into it; if it be not re- duced, it will slough away, and thus undergo permanent cure. Invagination of the Rectum occurs in some rare cases, and sometimes the portion that has descended through the anus has become strangulated. In such cases as these, reduction must be effected ; if possible without, but if necessary with, division of the sphincter. T have already referred (p. 689) to the occasional protrusion through the anus of a chronic intussusception carrying with it the ileo-cmcal valve, and the necessity of care in not confounding this "with a prolapsus of the mucous membrane. A remarkable case has been recorded by Stocks, of Salford, in which an anal protrusion of the size of a cocoa-nut contained an ovarian cyst. This was re- moved by an incision through the coats of the bowel; and, after the wound had healed, the bowel was returned. ? B VOL. II.738 SECONDARY DISEASES OF THE URINARY ORGANS. DISEASES OF THE GENITO-UKINARY ORGANS. CHAPTER LXVII. -—-♦— SECONDARY DISEASES OF THE URINARY ORGANS ARISING FROM SURGICAL CAUSES. The great majority of cases of stone in the bladder, stricture of the urethra, cystitis secondary to paralysis, retention from enlarged prostate, tumours of the bladder, and, in short, of every disease tending to hinder the escape of urine ft’om the bladder, or to induce chronic inflammation of that organ, terminate, if not relieved, by giving rise to fatal disease of the kidneys. This fact alone is sufficient to make the study of the secondary affections of the kidney of the greatest importance to the practical Sm’geon; and the obscurity which sur- rounds their diagnosis, and the general impotence of treatment intended for their relief, renders the subject weU worthy of the fullest investigation. My friend and colleague, Marcus Beck, has for some years devoted 'much attention to the morbid changes thus induced. His pathological investigations in this very important department of Genito-urinary Diseases have been as careful and minute as they have been extended. The following pages will be found to contain a summary of the principal results at which he has arrived, for which I am indebted to him. Morbid Conditions of the Bladder.—If we examine a case in which death has occmued from one of the above-named diseases, we find that the mucous membrane of the bladder shows signs of both recent and old inflam- mation. The recent is indicated by the swollen and softened condition of the mucous membrane, and the intense pm-ple of the summits of the rugae, and possibly by patches of ulceration, the ulcerated sm’faces being often covered by a thick slough closely resembling diphtheritic membrane. The old inflamma- tion is indicated by the dark slate-grey pigmentation which affects the greater part of the mucous membrane, and which has resulted from repeated attacks of intense congestion, in which red blood-coi’puscles have become extravasated, and, after breaking np and becoming absorbed, have left their pigment behind them. The muscular wall of the bladder is found to be hypertrophied, or not, according to circumstances. If, in order to expel the mine, it have been called upon to make a greatly increased pressure on its contents, the hypertrophy Avill be vei’y marked. If the obstruction to the flow of urine have been of a valvulai’ nature, as is often the case in enlarged prostate, then dilatation of the bladder wiU greatly exceed the hypertrophy of the muscular walls. It may, therefore, always be supposed, when great hypertrophy with contraction of t e bladder is found, that increased difficulty existed in expelling the urine, but739 CAUSES OF nyPEHTROniY OF BLADDER. the increased power of the bladder proved ecpml to the occasion. When dila- tation is found combined with hypertrophy, we must conclude that increased power was required to expel the urine, but the increase of muscular tissue was not quite sufficient, and that the bladder suffered frequently from over-disten- sion. When dilatation alone is found with scarcely any hypertrophy, avc know either that the bladder has been paralysed, or that the obstruction to the exit of urine was vahailar in nature, so that increased force applied to the contents of the bladder could .only shut the valve more closely; and over-distension, with such an amount of stretching of the neck as to render the valve incom- petent, was the only means by Avhich urine could be passed without artificial aid. This last condition is peculiar to prostatic disease, and some cases of tumour of the bladder. In aU cases of great hypertrophy of the muscular walls of the bladder, the bundles of fibres form ridges on the surface, giving rise to the condition known as faschulaibn. In many cases in which great pressm’e has frequently existed in the bladder, either from the forcible contraction of its hypertrophied walls on the contained urine, or fr’om simple over-distension ■from retention arising fr'om a valvular obstruction in the prostate, the mucous membrane becomes thrust between the bundles of muscular fibres, so forming pouches called saccuU. These sacculi are most fr’equent in the posterior part of the bladder, and, in most cases, their walls are composed merely of mucous membrane and peritoneum. Sometimes, however, a layer of muscular fibres is also found. These sacculi form pouches in Avhich putrid urine accumulates, and frequently gives rise to in^ammation of the mucous membrane, sometimes ending in ulceration, and possibly perforation of the bladder. Much more often it gives rise to attacks of local peritonitis, and portions of intestine may so become glued to the bladder. (Sec also Chapter LXX.) The causes which give rise to an increased demand for force in expulsion of the mine, and consequently to hypertrophy of the bladder, are various. The most common is perhaps obstruction in the urethra from stricture. In some cases it may arise fr-om an in-egular enlargement of the prostate in which the obstruction is not valvular in character. Villous growth and other tumoius of the bladder may call for increased force, from partially obstructing the orifice of the urethra. Chronic cystitis, fr-om the alteration it produces in the cha- racter of the urine, always causes more or less hyiDertrophy. Stone in the bladder causes obstruction to the flow of urine, partly mechanically and partly by the chronic cystitis to which it usually gives rise. The thick ropy mucus of chronic cystitis luidoubtedly offers very considerable obstruction to the flow of urine. All these causes, therefore, may give rise to more or less hypertrophy. J.here is no evidence that mere frequency of action plays any important part iu the production of hyiiertrophy. In the few recorded cases in which there wa.s peat frequency of mictiuition with healthy urine in cases of calculous pyelitis, no mention is made of any marked hyjiertrophy. There is every reason to believe tliat hypcrtropliy of the bladder plays a IS ev( very important part in the production of kidney-disease. In no case, as the xahes of the ureters incompetent. In the simple dilatation from valvulai- obstructip an the prostate, they are closed more firmly than natural No guigitation takes place, but of course the pressure in the ureters and kidneys 3 11 2740 SECOXDARY DISEASES OF THE UlUNARY ORGANS. will bo increased, while the bladder is over-distended. In hj^ertrophy of the walls, we also find a certain amount of obstruction to the entrance of urine into the bladder, as the ureter has to pass obliquely through the thickened wall, and is doubtless often pressed on by thickened bands of fibres. The swelling of the mucous membrane at the orifice of the ureter in an inflamed bladder probably adds to this obstruction. Here then, although there may be no over-distension of the bladder, there is increased pressure in the ureters and kidneys, as increased force is required to drive the urine, through the partially obstructed orifice of the ureter. The amount of obstruction offered by a hjqDertrophied bladder varies much, as it is not uncommon to find considerable thickening of the wall of the bladder without any marked signs of pressure in the ureters or kidneys. In cases of villous tumour of the bladder, one ureter and kidney only may be found to be affected, and it will then be seen that the growth implicates the orifice of that ureter. In others, both sides may be equally affected, and both orifices healthy, but it will then be found that the growth has obstructed the neck of the bladder, and that the signs of pressure in the m-eters and kidneys are due to hypertrophy or over-distension of the bladder. Diseased Conditions of the Ureters and Pelvis of the Kidney.—■ In such cases as we have been considering, three chief forms are met with: I. The results of simple over-distension ■without acute inflammation : 2. Acute inflammation without signs .of over-distension: 3. A combination of the two. Simple chronic over-distension leads to dilatation of the ureter and pelvis of the kidney, ■with some thickening of their walls. The thickening is in part due to hypertrophy of the muscular coat of the ureter. The miicous mem- brane is of an opaque white colour, and free from pigmentation or ulceration. At the same time that the ureter becomes dilated, it often seems to be in- creased somewhat in length, and is more or less tortuous, and not unfrequently iiTegular pouch-like dilatations occur. The dilatation is sometimes so great that the ureter resembles a piece of small intestine. (See Chapter LXXI.) In inflammation of the ureter and of the pelvis of the kidney, we find the mucous membrane swollen and softened, of an intense red colour, and frequently show- jng patches of a slate-grey, resulting from preAuous attacks, as in the bladder. Ulceration is not uncommon, and often the ulcers are coated with a tenacious slough Idee a diphtheritic membrane. The urine contained in such an ureter and pelvis is often ammoniacal and abominably foetid, and mixed ■with much pus and mucus. There is every reason to believe that this is a consequence ■ of extension of decomposition from the urine in the bladder to that in the • meter. The severity and acuteness of the inflammation in the ureter are pro- ■ bably due to the irritation of this foul and decomposing urine. But it by no i moans follows, because the urine in the bladder is decomposing, that the same ■ condition extends up the ureter. In the great majority of cases, the e.xtension i of decomposition to the pelvis occurs late in the disease, and acts as the fina i cause of death, by exciting acute inflammation in the kidney. This extension' does not take place on account of any incompetence of the valves or regmgi a- - tion of urine, as, on testing the valves in such cases they will bo found to be competent. It probably creeps through the orifice of the ureter, by means o the mucus and inflammatory products, in the wake of the inflammation spreac -DISEASE OF KIDNEY FROM PRESSURE. 741 jng If after washing urine that l)y continuity of tissue from the bladder to the ureters It ah out a bladder with Condy’s fluid, or some other antiseptic, the first enters from the ureters and flows from the catheter be ammoniacal, the con- dition of the patient is always serious, as the decomposition has spread ttom the bladder to the pelvis of the kidney, where no local means can reach it Morbid Conditions of the Kidney.—The conditions found m the kidney itself vary considerably. They may be divided as follows : 1. Changes result- iim from pressure by obstruction to the entrance of urine into the bladder: •>°\cute interstitial inflammation: 3. Acute interstitial inflammation with scattered abscesses: 4. The results of former acute or suliacute attacks fi-om which the patient has recovered. 1. The Rcsulls of Pressure.—K case lately occurred at University College Hospital, which afforded an opportunity of examining the uncomplicated effects of pressure uffth great advantage. The ureters had been pressed upon by two enormous sacciili, which projected from the bladder immediately behind the trigone. The bladder was much dilated and hypertrophied, but the cause of disease was uncertain. There were no signs of old or recent cystitis, and no instrument had been passed during life. In this case both ureters were greatly dilated, and the pelvis on each side Avas expanded so as to contain many ounces of fluid. The kidneys Avere somewhat increased in size, and before being- opened felt like great thick Availed bags of fluid giving all over a distinct sense of fluctuation. On being cut open, each presented the following appearances. The capsule Avas tough and opaque, and separated with difficulty from the kidney-substance, slightly tearing it in so doing, and leaving the surface coarse and irregular. The surffice Avas uniformly pale, and whitish in colour. No trace of the pyi-amids was to be seen, but where each should have been was a deep hollow lined with a smooth membrane continuous with the pelvis of the kidney. The cortex was of about normal thickness, but in some parts thinner than natural; it was somewhat tough in consistence, and presented an imiform opaque whitish tint. The whole kidney was thus converted into a great sac- culated bag, composed on one side of the dilated and thickened pelvis, and on the other of the expanded cortex of the kidney. There were no signs of past or present acute inflammation. On microscopic examination of a thin section of the cortex, the chief change noticeable Avas an abundant small round cell infiltration of the intertubular tissue of the kidney. Every tubule was sepa- rated from its neighbours by rapidly growing young connective tissue, croAvded Avith small round cells, and this, by pressing on the vessels, had given rise to the pale colour above noted. The neAv groAvth was most abundant round the ^Malpighian liodies, the capsules of Avhich Avere greatly thickened ; so much so, that in many the vessels had been strangled and obliterated. The amount of change Avas not uniform, the ncAV groAvth being more abundant in some parts than in others. Hie tubules themselves shoAved no great signs of change. They Avere slightly dilated in some parts, and the epithelium looked as if flattened by pressure, but in other respeets it Avas perfectly healthy. This case shows that uncomplicated tension fi’om partial obstruction of the ureter gives rise to a gradual absorption of the pyramids, and to a condition of interstitial inflammation of the kidney, probably varying in severity Avith the degree and acuteness of the obstruction. In more extreme cases than that above described.742 SECONDARY DISEASES OF THE URINARY ORGANS. the atrophy of the cortex becomes much more advanced, till nothing may be left but a layer of kidney-substance not thicker than a shilling. The micro- scope also shows more dilatation of the tubules and flattening of the epithelium. It is an interesting fact to be noted, that in the case above described the secre- tion of urine was abundant, its specific gravity was 1009, and it was free from albumen and casts. It is also evident that, if such a kidney as this were exposed to any additional source of irritation, more acute inflammation incompatible M'ith life would readily be set up. 2. Acute Diffuse Intershtial InflammaMon.—In this condition the kidney is soft and swollen. The capsule is opaque, and small vessels are seen ramifying in it. It separates easily, but tears the kidney-substance in so doing. The siuface of the kidney is coarse and irregular. The colour of the surface is mottled, the greater part being usually of a pale yellowish tint intermixed with pm-ple patches. Sometimes the mottling is very fine, almost granular. The venous stars always seen on the surface of the kidney are injected, and show out prominently. On section, the cortex is found to be abnoimally soft, and to present the same mottled colom- as the surface. Sometimes the part of the cortex corresponding to one pyramid may present a more uniformly pale appear- ance than that belonging to another. Small yeUowdsh spots, looking hke minute collections of pus, may be present, which are, however, on section found to be solid, though very soft. The pyi-amids ai-e usually intensely injected, and contrast strongly with the paler cortex. Pale streaks can often be seen running parallel to the straight tubules. These are most frequent in those cases in which the pelvis is filled with putrid urine. The pelvis is found in some cases free from any signs of acute inflammation, though more fr-equently it is much affected and filled with foul urine and mucus. The appearances here described are often conjoined with the signs of pressure mentioned above, varying from mere flattening to complete destruction of the j)yramids. The microscope shows that this condition is a mere exaggeration of that found as the result of simple pressure. The change is chiefly and primarily interstitial, but the small ceU growth is so abundant as in many parts to press upon and even destroy the tubules, areas being foimd in which nothing but crowds of small round cells can be seen. These, when large, form the small yellowish spots visible to the naked eye. It only requires an increased intensity of the in- flammation and a softening of these spots to convert them into minute abscesses. As in the form of interstitial nephritis first mentioned, the new growth is most marked round the Malpighian bodies. The change is rarely uniform throughout the kidney. It varies in degree usually in every field of the microscope, and parts may be foimd apparently almost healthy. The epithe- lium throughout the kidney is usually swollen and granular, and readily washes out in preparing the specimen, but it does not choke the tubules as in acute catairhal nephritis. In very acute cases, small round cells, similar to those outside the tubules, are seen in the lumen of the tube surrounded by ‘ epithelium. These have probably found their way in fr’om the outside, and, if w’ashcd on by the secretion from above, would appear as pus-cells in the luinc. The vessels are often seen to be gorged with blood, and occasionally minute hcemorrhages are present. It is not always easy to distinguish this form of disease by the unaided eye, as, from the pallor caused by the pressure on theACrTE INTERSTITIAL NEPHRITIS WITH ABSCESSES. 743 A cssels from the small cell infiltration, it closely resembles the fotty kidney or some cases of catarrhal nephritis. The microscope alone can decide the question with certainty. Even in such a kidney the secretion of urine may be moderately abundant. In a case at University Collep Hospital the patient excreted over 300 grains of nrea on the last day of his life. 3. Acute ■Interstitial Nephritis ivilh Scattered (Suppuration of the ki jiiej—suppurative nephritis: when accompanied by pyelitis—pyelo-nephritis (Uayer) .) This is usually found in conjunction with that form of acute pyelitis in which the pelvis of the kidney is filled with putrid urine, pus, and mucus, but is by no means constantly so. In one case which was observ'ed at University College Hospital, both kidneys were equally riddled with abscesses.

Comparatively healthy tubules with inter-tubular ceU infiltration, to the left. but in one the pelvis was acutely inflamed and filled with foul urine, while in the other it was free from disease, and the urine it contained acid, and with- out unpleasant smeU. The kidney is generally swollen and enlarged. The fat surrounding it is usually abnormally adherent to the capsule. The capsule is thick and opaque, and marked by ramiform vessels, shovflng clearly on the surface. It separates easily, but in so doing tears the kidney-substance. The surface of the kidney presents a more or less mottled appearance. _ The chief tint is the same as in the diflPuse form just described, and is, in fact, due to the existence of the same condition ; but here and there, scattered usually in groups, are bright yellow spots, surrounded by a dark red areola, and varying in size from a pin’s head to a split pea. On cutting into these yellow spots, each is found to contain a drop of pus. These minute abscesses are usually grouped in areas corresponding to that part of the cortex which belongs to a single pyramid. If now a section be made of the kidney, the points of suppura- tion will not be found to be limited to the surface. Often they are continued down towards a pyramid, and arc connected with a yellow streak running parallel to the straight tubules as far as the papilla, or, if that have been partly destroyed by pressure, as far as the point at which the tubules open into the pelvis. This condition is not invariable, as sometimes the abscesses are perfectly isolated, and show no connection whatever with the pyramidal portion of the kidney. Occasionally one or more of the abscesses may burst beneath the capsule, separating it from the kidney, and giving rise to further suppura-744 SECONDARY DISEASES OF THE URINARY ORGANS. tion, may include the whole organ in a large collection of pus. The microscope shows that in this form of kidney the appearances are essentially the same as in the last; the chief change being the accumulation of crowds of small round cells in the intertubular substance, the degree of cell-infiltration varying in almost every field of the microscope. At the point at which an abscess is forming, or at the margin of one already formed, the crowds of small round cells are seen to press upon the tubules, separating them widely, and squeezing Fij:. 710.—A. Group of Abscesses on Surface of Kidney. B. Vertical Section of tlie same. Fig. 709.—Acute Interstitial Nephritis : Condition of Epitlielium. their walls together. Then the wall becomes indistinct; then only a few epithelium-cells can be recognised in the crowd of leucocytes ; lastly, nothing but leucocytes can be seen, and a little nearer the centre the intercellular substance becomes fluid, and the cells float free, and jius is so formed. The red areola is not found to be due to extravasation, although haemorrhages may exist scattered thi’ough such a kidney. The yeUow streaks in the pyramids are found to be due to a similar condition of intertubular cell-infiltration. Some- times clots may be seen in the vessels of the pyramids. These are probably secondary to the inflammation of the parts smTounding the vessels. As in the former variety, small round cells may be found in the tubules as well as outside them. The epithelium is usually much swollen, and sometimes des- quamating and choking the tubules, but this is only in those areas hi which the interstitial inflammation is most advanced. In others it may appeal’ almost healthy. This form of kidney merges into the diffuse variety, the solid yel- lowish spots before mentioned representing points which, had the patient lived longer, might have softened into abscesses. It is of coinse frequently conjoined with the signs of pressme, absorption of the pyramids, and dilatation of the pelvis. It is perhaps the most frequent form met with in the post imrlem ' room. The abscesses of the kidney thus .arising fr’om acute suppurative nephritis must not be confounded with those seen as the result of the j lodgment of septic embola in pymmia. These are usually larger, are more I distinctly wedge-shaped, and sometimes surrounded by a zone of hmmorrhage.

The microscope shows an absence of the general changes noticed abo^'e, and if an early stage of a jiymmic abscess can be <letectcd, htemorrhage will be found in the midst of comparatively healthy kidney-tissue, Avhilst the earliest stage of suppurative nephritis is characterised l^y acute cell-infiltration. a. Effects of Former A ftacics from u'hich the Patient has Recovered.—It is possible that the kidney may undergo extensive intertubular change, and yet, if the cause be removed, the inflammatory growth may be completely absorbed, and the organ regain its normal condition. More commonly, however, the new growth undergoes a development into fibrous tissue, a change correspond- ing exactly to that which occurs in the cicatrisation of a gi’anulating sore, and accompanied by a similar process of contraction. Thus we get an increase in the intertubular connective tissue, and at the same time a contraction and induration of the whole organ, so much so that it is sometimes reduced to less than a quarter of its normal bulk. If the pyi’amidal portion hare undergone absorption, this is never repaired, but, as its function seems merely that of a duct, its loss is of no great moment. In a kidney of this kind we find the fat adherent to the capsule, and the cajisule to the gland-tissue. It strips off with difficulty, and is thick and opaque. The siu’face of the kidney is irregular, granular, or perhaps even puckered by cicatrices. Scattered over the surface in most cases are niunerous small cysts. These are supposed to be due to the strangulation of the tubules by the fibrous gTowth. The colour is usually dark and somewhat red, mth numerous small dilated veins showing on the surface. On section, the cortex will be found to be greatly thinned, being sometimes not thicker than a shilling. The pyramids, unless absorbed fi’om previous pressure, are but little altered. The whole organ is of a leathery toughness which is quite peculiar. The pehus may be pigmented from previous inflammation. The microscope shows a great increase of the intertubular tissue, which is of a dense fibroid character. The tubules vary in size ; some are strangulated and compressed, others are dilated above the strangulation. Many°of the ilalpighian coipuscles are obliterated, lea'V'ing merely capsules containing the remains of the obliterated vessels. The capsules of all the Malpighian bodies are greatly thickened. The epithelium may be flattened by pressure, or normal. TTe small arteries usually show some hypertrophy of their muscular coats. Such a kidney as this may undergo a second attack of acute inflammation, and we then find a combination of the form of the contracted kidney with the colour and softness, and possibly the scattered abscesses, of the acute variety. It will be seen from the above description that this form of kidney differs in no ^\aJ to the naked eye from the ordinary granular, contracted, dr gouty 'K ney. > e do not, however, find the general changes associated with that disease. In a case which lately occurred at University College Hospital, in which this concbtion was well marked as the result of stricture of the urethra, there AN as no hypertrophy of the heart, and no change could be recognised in the walls of the small vessels in other parts. ftom ivhat has been said, it is evident that the inflammation of the kidnev arising as the conseqnenee of diseases of the lower urinary tract is primarily interstitial in character, the changes in the epithclinin being secondary.746 SECOxXJJAllY JJlEEASES OF THE UlilNAllY OUGAiXE. Causes of Interstitial Inflammation.—The following may be stated as the causes which in varying degree take part in the production of interstitial inflammation of the kidney: 1. Tension ; 2. llcflex in-itation of the kidney • 3. The presence of septic matter in the pelvis of the kidney. Each of these acting singly may induce serious disease, or perhaps even cause death, but we seldom see such cases. More often, two at least are in action. 1. Tension. It has been shown before how this is induced by any obstruc- tion to the free entrance of mine into the bladder. Every practical Surgeon i is acquainted with the fact that tension is one of the most powerful irritants to which the living tissues can be exposed. The examples of a tight stitch, pent up pus, and mammary abscess from obstruction to a duct, must occur to everyone. In the analogous case of the mamma, the inflammation resulting from obstruction aflccts the interacinous cellular tissue, which becomes infil- trated with small cells. In the liver, Wickham Legg and others have shown that ligature of the bile-duct causes interstitial hepatitis. In the kidney, no recorded case is to be found of suppuration occurring as the result of simple tension ; but in all cases in which evidence of tension exists, that is to say, dilated mnter or pelvis of the kidney, or some source of sudden obstruction as a more or less impacted calculus, subacute interstitial inflammation -will be found. It seems almost as if the new cell-growth were a conservative change intended to strengthen the tubules to resist the increased pressure. How- ever this may be, a kidney in this condition is in a state in which a httle further irritation from any cause may hurry it on to fatal and acute inflammation. 2. Reflex Irriiation of the Kklmij.—Mechanical injm-ies to the neck of the bladder or posterior part of the urethra, and probably diseases of these parts in which constantly recimlng in-itation is present, re-act upon the kidney through the influence of the nervous system. It is needless here to attempt any ex- planation of the exact manner in which this takes place, as it would be merely a matter of speculation ; but a few facts may be given as proof of the assertion. It is weU. known that several cases are on record, in which death has occurred from suppression of urine following the simple introduction of a catheter, the post mortem examination showing a condition of intense conges- tion of the kidney. Again, patients Avith stone in the bladder occasionally die from acute inflammation of the kidney, often accompanied by suppmation, after the operation of hthotrity. Cases of this kind have occurred in which the cystitis was not increased by the ojperation, in which the decomposition of m-ine remained unchanged, and no altered circumstance existed, except the mechanical injm-y of the passage of the instrument, to account for the sudden supervention of acute nephritis. In these cases signs of chronic disease, which has been rendered acute by the additional irritation, are always present. Lastly, a few cases have been observed at University College Hospital after operations for stricture, with the vieAV of ascertaining if any change could be found in the ' urine as the direct result of the operation. In three cases of Holt’s dilatation, the urine Avas found to be fr-ee from blood, or to contain no more than could be accounted for by the operation, during the first hour or hom- and a half after the operation, and then to become gradually more and more bloody for another hour or hour and a half, and after that to become gi-adually free fr-om blood.747 SEPTW MATTER IE RELVIS OF KIJJXEY. III one case there was almost total supin'cssion for the first hour and a half, followed bj very bloody urine. In one case of internal urethrotomy, during: the first hour the urine flowed away in great quantities, and was almost free from blood. For the next six hours it was passed in moderate quantity, and Avas A'cry darkly tinged Avith blood. In all foim cases, there Avas some reason to. believe that the blood came from the kidney. It occurred after the hemor- rhage from the Avound Avould have ceased ; it Avas uniformly mixed Avith the urine, and free from clots. These cases are of course insufficient in number to draAv any conclusions from them ; but. as far as they go, they tend to shoAV that, ill all cases of operation on the lu’ethi’a, there is a miniature representa- tion of that intense congestion of the kidney Avhich is found in cases of deatli. from suppression of urine after simple catheterism. Possibly in some cases the dilatation of the vessels is preceded by a contraction of longer or shorter dm\ation, giving rise to the suppression noted aboA'e. In a healthy kidney such an attack of acute hypermmia soon passes off and does no harm ; but, supposing the kidney to be already diseased, the subacute condition may readily become acute and terminate fatally. Repeated attacks of such hyper- lemia, Avhich probably result from the irritation of a stone, or passing urine through a bad strictiu’e, Avould in aU probability be alone sufficient to lead to a ckronic interstitial change in the kidney. It is a matter of observation, that fatal affections of the kidney scarcely ever result from operations performed on the penile portion of the m-ethra. 3. The presence of Septic Matter in the Pelvis of the Kidney. This plays a most important part in producing the final acute condition which often kills the patient. In the first place, the mere presence of such an irritating sub- stance as ammomacal m’ine in the pehds of a kidney already diseased, Avould certainly intensify the existing infiammation. It seems probable, hoAvever, that in many cases the septic matter thus pent up at some degree of pressm’c (for the thick mixture of mucus, pus, and urine cannot pass the valves of the ureter aheady someAvhat obstructed by the SAV'ollen mucous membrane, and prhaps by a hypertrophied or distended bladder, so readily as healthy urine) becomes absorbed by the lymphatics of the kidney, and thus gives rise to a diffuse intertubular inflammation rapidly running on to suppuration. This wou account for the pale streaks seen running in many cases parallel to the straight tubules in the pyramids, and expanding in the cortex. Pro- a y t IS condition alone is sufficient to account for many cases of acute siippurative nephritis, but it must be remembered that suppuration of the kidney does occur, not unfrequently, in cases in which the urine in the peyis IS ee rom decomposition. Dr. George Johnson suggests that the scattered abscesses may occasionally be due to rupture of the tubules and local extraAasatioiis of urine ; and in a kidney already softened by acute interstitial lepliritis. It IS very possible that this may occim. Dr. Dickinson accounts for the abscesses by a theory of septic embolism in the A-eins, a sort of local pyiomia; the presence of the general change, and the fact that CA-ery stage is found l.eUoen comn.cncng diffuse interstitial i„fl„,„„,atio., and the MIy f„red abscesses seem to contradict this view, (ioodliart of Gny’s Hospital Iris suggested the possible connection bettveen erysipelas and snppnratiL of the kidney, and has advanced some very interestiiig evidence in fa™,r of h^L viet748 SEGONDAliY DISEASES OF THE UJilNAliY ORGANS. M’hich is well Avorthy of furtlicr investigation, although, at most, it could but account for a small proportion of the deaths from this disease. It Avill be seen from the above, that in the production of fatal interstitial aiephritis a number of causes are at work, sometimes all together, sometimes singly, and no exclusiA’e theory can possibly explain more than a small propor- tion of the cases. Symptoms of Kidney-Disease in Surgical Affections of the Genito- urinary Organs.—Simple although a condition seriously •endangering the success of any operation on the urinary organs, gives rise to remarkably few symptoms ; and it is surprising to what an extent the structure of the kidney may be damaged by chronic interstitial nephritis arising from this cause Avithout interfering in any noticeable degree Avith the patient’s health. It gives rise to no oedema, no marked anaamia, and no alteration in the fimction of the skin. The most characteristic feature is probably an increase in the quantity of lU'ine, Avith a diminution in the specific gi’aAuty. In a case lately in University College Hospital, the patient passed five pints of urine daily of a specific gravity of 1003 or 1004. In all cases in which it is desirable to ascertain the condition of the kidneys, the urine should bo collected for the whole day, and the specific gTavity taken. If the quantity be large and the specific gravity low, chronic interstitial nephritis may be suspected. The quantity of albmnen is ahvays small, and it may be absent altogether. At most, only a foAV hyaline casts can be found, and often no renal epithelium. The excretion of inea is usually in sufficient amount, as the quantity of urine makes up for the Ioav specific gravity. If the primary disease give rise to much pus and mucus, or to a little blood, the difficulties of diagnosis are greatly increased, and reliance must then be placed solely in the quantity and specific gTavity, and CA’en these may proA'e deceptive. It is rarely possible to gain much information by feeling the kidney. There is no tenderness, and it is seldom sufficiently enlarged for the Sm’geon to form any conclusion as to its condition. Suhcu'ute interstitial nephritis ghres rise to more evident symptoms. The patient is Aveak and languid, and slowly but steadily emaciates. He loses his appetite and has occasional attacks of nausea, though rarely actual vomiting. His tongue is furred and has a tendency to become dry, and occasionally there is thirst. There is no tenderness OA'er the kidney. There may be occa- sionally a slight feeling of chilliness, seldom actual rigors. The temperature will be found to be slightly elevated, especially at night; and for this reason, in any doubtful case, it is essential to obtain the evening temperatine, as in the morning it may fall to normal. It seldom rises above 101 F. The mine is abiuidant and usually of Ioav specific gravity, but by no means always so. It is seldom possible to find casts or to judge of the amount of albumen, as this form of disease usually accompanies bladder-affections, Avhich fill the urine Avith pus or mucus, as chronic cystitis, stone, and stricture. At most, only a fcAv renal epithelium-cells and possibly a hyaline cast or tAVO could be found. This condition may last for weeks or even months, the patient gradually be- coming Aveaker and weaker until he is carried off by some intercurrent disease, or dies of pure exhaustion. More commonly, however, an acute attack siiper- A-encs on the subacute, either spontaneously or as the result of some surgicaSYMPTOMS OF KIDNEY-DISEASE. 74f> interference, and, rapidly ending in suppuration of the kidney, terminates fatally. On the other hand, the symptoms often gradually subside, the tem- perature becomes normal, and the patient gains strength. The improvement usually coincides with some diminution of the local irritation at the primary seat of disease, such as results from rest in bed in a case of stone, or from the- cleansing of a foul bladder. As the symptoms are somewhat indefinite, it is often difficult to say how much is due to renal mischief and how much to the- primary affection ; but wherever we find a diy tongue, a persistent nocturnal elevation of temperature, loss of appetite, general weakness and emaciation, wc ought to make every attempt to get rid of these symptoms before under- taking any serious surgical procedure, such as the treatment of stricture, lithotomy, or lithotrity, the irritation of Avhich might start the smouldering- inflanimation into activity. Acute mterslitial and suppurative nephritis gives rise to much more manifest symptoms, often supervening on those just described. The attack, Avhicb is- often induced by some surgical procedure although it may commence spon- taneously, begins with a severe rigor, followed by j)rofuso sweating. The temperatme may rise to 105° F. or 106° F. After the rigor it falls, but remains somewhat above normal. The rigors and SAveating may be repeated more than once. The tongue rapidly becomes dry, red, and fissured, looking- like a jnece of broiled ham, and sordes accumulate on the teeth. There are complete loss of appetite, and rapid emaciation ; nausea is almost a constant symptom, and actual Ammiting is common. Diarrhoea may occur. The patient soon sinks into a heavy drowsy state, often Avith contracted jrapils, so that the condition may closely resemble that of opium-poisoning. He can be roused and answers rationally if spoken to, and in most cases complains of little pain or discomfort. The temperature noAv usually falls, sometimes below normal, and the skin feels cold and clammy. In this form, there is usually some tenderness on pressing firmly in the region of the kidneys. As the case but it rarely reaches a condition of absolute coma. Convulsions are extremely rare. There is no oedema at any time. The urine varies much. It usually becomes more or less bloody, and in rare cases is ^ippressed ; though much more frequently a considerable quantity is passed up to the time of death. It is usually in such a state fr-om decomposition and the presence of pus, blood and mucus, as to render accurate chemical and microscopical investio-ation impossible. Pus-cells are constantly present, but Avhether they come fr-om the ticiTifiv nr f.lipi Tilaflfl/iT in miTT l_ 1_ _ . . progresses, muttering delirium sets in, followed by more complete insensibility «r ” V.*. The diu-ation of an acute attack as above described, when terminating75° SECOXDARY DISEASES OF THE URINARY ORGANS. fatally, varies from a few days to a couple of weeks. In fovourable cases, even after very marked symptoms, suck as the rigors, dry tongue, vomiting, and diarrhoea, the patient may slowly recover. The cause of death in many cases seems to bo septicmmia from absoi-ption of the septic matter from the kidney rather than urtemia. Certainly the mode of death differs greatly fi-om that of acute Bright’s disease, the jn’ofonnd coma and convulsions being rarely present. The DiCKjnosi!^ has to be made from pyjcmia, peritonitis, typhoid fever, and ague. From pymmia the diagnosis is somewhat difficult, the most important jioints being the vomiting, the absence of secondary abscesses, the di’owsy state into which the joatient soon falls, and the fact that the temperatm’e often remains for days before death, below normal. The vomiting and extreme illness may resemble the low, diffuse, painless form of peritonitis sometimes seen in affections of the bladder, but the vomiting has not the pumping cha- racter of that in peritonitis, and the elevation of temperature for the first few days is unlike that form of peritonitis in which the temperature is persistently low. Suppurating kidney can only resemble typhoid fever in rare cases, and the absence of spots, and the temperature will usually serve to distinguish them. In the case above mentioned, the temperature was below normal for three weeks before death. From ague, the disease is diagnosed by the absence of the com- plete intermission after the sweating stage; but it must be always remembered that patients who have suffered fr’om ague are singularly liable to attacks of fever after any operation on the urinary organs. Urethral Fever or Uraemic Fever.—This term has been somewhat loosely used to signify a rigor followed by sweating, and more or less prolonged ele- vation of temperature, consequent on some operation on the urinary organs, or possibly arising spontaneously. It vdll be seen at once that this definition includes acute interstitial nephritis, as above described, and also pyasmia. AVhen a patient has been said to have died of “ urethral fever,” one of these two conditions has been invariably found, although no Surgeon would inten- tionally include pymmia mider lu-ethral fevei’. It is probable that the real nature of the affection is, at least in the great majority of cases, a distimbance of the circulation in the kidney, or some interference with its function, due to reflex irritation fi’om the passage of the instrument, as before described in speaking of the sources of iiTitation to the kidney. That it is not due to absorption of urine from a wound in the urinary passages, is evident fr’om the fact that rigors are rare after lithotomy, and are not a marked symptom of extravasation of urine, and that womids of the urethra anterior to the scrotum scarcely ever give rise to them. This view of the renal origin of so-called urethral fever is supported by Malherbe, in his treatise on Uraemic Fever, as he would caU it. It is difficult to obtain direct proof, but further knowledge might be gained by carefuUy examining hour by horn’ the quantity and quality of the urine secreted after any urethral or vesical operation, and at ‘ the same time accmately observing the changes in temperature, even when the rigor does not occur. Malherbe states that the temperature rises in almost every case ; and in one of the four cases of stricture mentioned before, the temperature rose to 100’3° F. about three hours after the operation, nhen the urine became bloody. It fell to 99'2° F. when the blood disappeared; butTREATMEXT OF INTERSTITIAL XERHRITIS. 75^^ tlirec hours afterwards a}j;ain rose to 100‘3° F. a little more blood showed itself, and the temperature Further investigation in the same line might lead to some important results. „ , , ., i Prognosis.—The prognosis in acute affections of the kidney,^ secondary to bladder disease, is always gi-ave ; but even the most unpromising cases may recover. Vomiting, delirium, partial insensibility, and a very dry tongue, are all bad signs. A marked diminution of the quantity, and much blood in the urine, are unfavourable symptoms. Treatment.—Prevention is of course first to be aimed at. No patient should therefore be submitted to an operation except in cases of necessity, without a careful examination of the whole day’s urine as to specific gravity, the presence and quantity of albumen, and the microscopic appearances. If possible, the temperature should be observed night and morning for two or thi’ee days. If any suspicion arise as to the condition of the kidneys, that operation should be selected, when practicable, which gives rise to least irrita- tion. Soft instruments should be employed instead of metal, and a sufficient ■interval allowed between their use. Above all, any treatment calculated to cause cystitis, or to give rise to decomposition of the urine, should be avoided. As there can be but little doubt that the causes of decomposition are often in- troduced into, the bladder by catheters or other instruments, these should be kept scrupulously clean. Some recommend oiling the instruments with carbolic acid and oil (1 to 10). If decomposition already exist in the urine, it should if possible be aiTested by washing out the bladder with some antiseptic, for which purpose quinine and diluted sulphuric acid, in the proportion of gr. ij. and m. ij. to an ounce of water, wifi, be found very efficacious. If the cause of the renal mischief be stricture of the m'ethra or stone, some operation must of course be undertaken; but if the temperature be elevated, or there be other ■fiigns of renal disease, it should be delayed until an attempt has been made by rest and other remedies to bring the kidneys into a healthy state. If after a few days no improvement be seen, and it seem probable that the disease is kept up by the presence of the stone or stricture, further delay is useless; and, choosing the least severe and iivitating operation, the Surgeon must operate at once. The treatment of well-marked interstitial nephritis is extremely unsatisfactory. If there be any tenderness in the loins, dry cupping may be of service. The bowels should be well acted on by purgatives, and the skin by hot-air baths, to relieve the kidneys as much as possible. Heroic operations undertaken during acute nephritis in the hope of removing the cause, are almost always, if not invariably, fatal. Quinine and opium have been recommended for the prevention of the rigors that frequently follow operations on the urinary organs. Opium is probably of service, but must be given with great caution if any symptoms of ursemic poisoning exist; but quinine has not, according to most w'ho have tiled it, proved of any use. Diet and stimulation must be regulated on general principles.752 V1U±VARY CALCULUS. CHAPTEK LXVIII. —t— UIMKAP.Y CALCULUS ANI) IJTITOTOMY. CALCULOUS DIATHESES AND DEPOSITS. The urine is liable to the deposit of various solid matters, which, when- amorphous and impalpahlc, are termed Sediments ; when ciystalline, they constitute Gravel; and when concrete. Calculus or Stone. These deposits, whatever form they assume, are the result of constitutional causes ; and the constitutional conditions giving rise to them are commonly called Diatheses. Of these, Siugcons usually recognise three ; the Uric or LitMc, the Oxalic, and the Phosphatic; besides, these,'however, others doubtless exist, the precise characters of which have yet to be determined. Uric or Lithic Acid Diathesis.—This diathesis chiefly occurs in in- dividuals of robust habit of body and florid appearance, Avho have lived high, and suffer from irritable gastric dyspepsia. It is often associated with a gouty or rheumatic tendency, or Avith some of the more chronic forms of skin disease, especially psoriasis. It is characterised by scanty and acid high-coloured urine, which deposits on cooling two kinds of sediment, a yellow and a red. According: to Lehmann, these sediments consist of urate of soda : but Golding Bird, and, I belieA-e, most of the chemists in this country, regard them as urate or lithatc- of ammonia. But AY. Eoberts states that they have no definite chemical com- position, consisting of uric acid combined A\ith soda, potass, and ammonia, in varyino- proportions. The yellow sediment, containing an admixture of the , colouring matter of the urine, is usually dependent on slight disorder of the digestive organs and skin, coming and going under the influence of very trivial causes. The red sediment, owing its colour, according to Bird, to an : admixture of purpurine, a highly carbonaceous ingredient, and indicat^e of imperfect assimilation, is met with in persons of full habit, who hve too ^eely.treatment of uric acid diathesis. 753 ■V V'lrietvor rathev an admixture, of these sediments, constitutes the lateritious thvosif so common in gout and rheumatism. These deposits disappear com- pletely’on boiling, which distinguishes them from any other sediments. The red sand or gi-avel is a crystallised variety of the lithic acid sediment. I may be compared, in general appearance, to Cayenne pepper, and under the microscope presents the characters seen in Fig. 711. It is not unfrequently met with in children of a strumous habit, ivho lu’c allowed more animal food than they can well assimilate. Occasionally crystals of imic acid are found intennixed uith these deposits, presenting the characters figured in ^Calculi. The calculi that occur in tliis diathesis are of two kinds ; the unc acid, and the urate of ammonia. The uric acid calculus (Fig. 713) is usually of small or moderate size, varying fi'om a pin’s head to a pigeon’s egg ; it is oval, somewhat compressed and fiattened, smooth on the surface, and oi a fawn colour. On section it is seen to be laminated, and to present various shades of a light brown or fawn tint. The mate of ammonia calculus is of very rare occmrence ; when met with, it is chiefly in children, and is composed of concentric rings, having a fine earthy appearance, and being clay-coloured. " The uric acid calculus may be distinguished ft’om the urate of ammonia by heating a fr’agment in solution of caustic potash: both dissolve, but the mate of ammonia evolves ammonia in the process of solution. Treatment—The treatment of the mic acid diathesis must be directed to the removal of the prirhe causes of this • con- dition, viz., mal-assimilation, defective oxygenation of the blood, and the ingestion of too large a quantity of stimu- lating food. AU these may be remedied by attention to ordinary hygienic measmes ; the patient must live sparely, should avoid fermented liquors, espe- cially red and efiervescent wines, and abstain fr’om sweets, pastry, &c. He should take plenty of out-door exercise, and keep the skin in healthy action by warm diy air or vapour bathing, and the use of horsehair gloves. The bowels must also be carefully regulated by means of saline and other aperients, with occasional alterative doSes of blue pfil; to which, if the constitution be pecu- liarly rheumatic or gouty, some colchicum may advantageously be added. Preferable to aU medicines, perhaps, are the natural aperient saline waters of PiiUna, Friedrichshall, or Carlsbad, taken fasting. The patient may also be directed to drink some of the natmal alkaline waters, as those of Vichy, Vais, or Fachingen. The Vichy waters, containing a large quantity of carbonate of soda, with free carbonic acid, are extremely sendceable for the correction of this diathesis. If they cannot be procured, a very good alkaline drink consists of a scruple of bicarbonate of potass and five grains of nitre dissolved in a tumbler of cold or tepid water, to which about five grains of citric acid or a table- spoonful of lemon-juice may be added, and taken early in the morning or in the middle of the day. The preparations of lithia are of essential seindce in remo\dng uric acid gravel or in clearing the urine of urates. They may be given alone, or in combination with the citrate or carbonate of potass. Fig. 713.—Uric Acid Calculus. IVlien uric acid calculus has actually formed, it is weU not to give the 3 c VOL. IX.754 URINARY CALCULUS. alkaline remedies too long, or in too large quantity ; lest the stone rapidly increase in size by becoming encrusted with phosphates. Oxalic Diathesis.—This is characterised by the formation of oxalate of lime in the urine. It generally occurs in individuals in whom there is defective assimilation, dependent upon exhausted nervous energy, arising from over- work, mental anxiety, or venereal excesses. The patient is usually pale and hypochondriacal, suffers from dyspepsia, acidity of stomach, and disturbed sleep. In these cases there is often loss of sexual power ; a state of debility of the generative organs, connected either with the w'ant of erectile vigour, or too speedy emissions. The mine is usually very pale, abundant, and acid, and there is heat and smarting during its passage along the m-ethra. In this dia- thesis there is no sediment or gravel, properly speaking, but the crystals float in the urine ; subsiding, however, when it stands, but not occurring in suffi- cient quantity to constitute a true sediment (Fig. 714). Roberts states that oxaluria ac- companies no constant state of symptoms, and questions the existence of such a dia- thesis ; so much so, as to state that the pre- sence of oxaliu’ia by itself furnishes no indi- cation for treatment. Calculus.—The oxa- late of lime or mulberry calculus is usually of a dark-brown or almost black ■coloiu’, moderate ^ , Fig. 714.—Ciystals of Oxalate of Lime. being Seldom '^^iate of Lime Calculus. larger than a walnut, and round; it is always rough, tuberculated, and some- times almost spiculated on the surface (Fig. 715). Treatment.—When there is no calculus, it is necessary to put the patient upon a light and noiu’ishing diet, especially fish, as recommended by Biid, cautioning him to avoid sweets and aU fermented liquors, with the exception of a moderate quantity of brandy. Tonics, particularly the mineral acids, iron, zinc, and quinine, may be given, and the residence should, if possible, be changed for a time to a warm chmate. When calculus is formed, there is, owing to its roughness, and the irrit- able state of the patient’s nervous system, usually a good deal of pain in the region of the bladder, requiring the free administration of opiates. Phosphatic Diathesis.—This chiefly oc- em's in old persons, or in those who are pre- maturely aged, with a broken constitution and an anemic condition of the system. In this diathesis, the sediment and ealenU may occm in three distinct forms i 1. Triple or Ammoniaeo-Magnesian Phosphate; 2. Phosphate of L mo; and 8. Mued Phosphates, consisting of a mixture of the preceding v arieties. Fip 716._Cryslals of Ammoniaoo- Magnesiaii Phospliatc.CYSTINE AND XANTHINE. 755 1. The Triple Phosphate (Fig. 710) usually occurs in urine that is copious, pale, and barely acid, sickly to the smell, and soon decomposing and becoming very offensive. In other cases the lu’ine is dark, alkaline, and mucous. This condition especially occurs in old people, and is associated with much debility, irritability of mind, pallor, and aummia. 2. The Phosphate of Lime sediment is of less common occurrence; it usually occurs in pale and offensive, readily putrescent urine, mixed with much mucus, and in some cases apparently produced by the mucous membrane of the bladder. .3. Mixed Phosphates commonly occur after injmies of the spine, as the result of general impairment of the health, or in advanced cases of prostatic disease. They are occasionally met with in large quantity, forming a kind of mortar-like sediment in the bladder. They are deposited whenever the urine from any cause becomes alkaline from decomposition. Calculi.—The phosphatic calculi are very common. The most frequent is the mixed, or fusible calculus, as it is termed, on account of the ready way in which it melts when exposed to heat. This calculus is fr-iable, laminated, and has a chalky or earthy look. The calculus composed of phosphate of ammonia and magnesia is not so common ; it resembles the preceding rather closely in its general cha- racters, but is whiter and has a more chalky look. The phosphate of lime cal- culus is extremely rare ; it is laminated, and harder than the other varieties. Treatment.—The treatment of the phosphatic diathesis consists principally in improving the digestive powers, and in restoring the general strength of the patient by giving him good food, wine, or beer. The administration of tonics, especially of nitric acid, should be attended to, and exercise in the open air enjoined. As there are usually much pain and uTitability of system in this diathesis, opium may advantageously be administered. Roberts con- siders phosphates in the great majority of cases as merely the result of the alkalinity of the urine, from whatever cause arising. Besides the calculi mentioned, various other kinds of concretions form in the urine, each of which doubtless represents a diathesis ; the characters of which, however, are not so distinctly marked or so well recognised as those that have just been described. Cystine is one of the rarer forms of morbid product occasionally met with in the bladder. It differs from all other ingredients in containing a large quantity—about 26 per cent.—of sulphim. It is very rarely seen as a sediment in the urine ; but when it occurs in this form it presents the microscopic characters seen in Fig. 717, being composed of hexagoual laminae. Calculi con- taining cystine have occasionally been met with. Golding Bird states that in Guy’s Hos- pital Museum there are eleven composed of this peculiar animal matter; and in the Museum of University College we have some good specimens. Cystine in calculus has a peculiar yellowish or greenish and waxy look, ’very different from any other ingredient met with in lu’inary concretions. Crystals of Cystiue. Xanthine, or Xanthic Oxide, was first noticed by Marcet, and has since 3 C 2UlilFAllY CALCULUS. 756 boon obsen’od by Laugier, Tjangenbeck, and others. It is of extroinely rare occniToncc, and has only been found in four recorded instances in the form of calculous concretions. These ha^•e generally been of small size, with the exception of the one removed by Langonbeck, which weighed 388 grains. For a detailed account of the chemical characters and constituents of this sub- stance, as well as of the other materials of which calculi* arc formed, I must refer to the works of Gr. Bird, Beale, Thudichum, &c. Carbonate of Iiime has occasionally been met Anth as an amorphous powder in allcaline or A-’ery faintly acid urine. Bird states that he has detected carbonate of lime as forming a distinct stratum in some phosphatic calculi; and Thudichum has examined prostatic concretions consisting almost entirely of this' substance—the urinary origin of Avhich, hoAvever, he doubts. But minary vesical calculi composed of carbonate of lime are certainly very rarely met with. STONE IN THE BLAHDEB. Fig. ns.- Section of an Aiternating Calculus. S'L'RUCTURE OF Calculi.—Calculi, though sometimes composed throughout of the same deposit, are not unfrequently made up of layers or strata, differing in chemical composition foom one another, and these usually go by the name of alternating calculi (Fig. 718). Most frequently the nucleus consists of hthic acid; next in the order of frequency comes the oxalate of lime'; and then the concretion of a phosphatic character throughout. It is veiy seldom that the nucleus is absent; but concre- tions have occasionally been met with in which none could be detected, or in which it was even replaced by a cavity. The nucleus is usually as nearly as possible in the centre of the calculus, and is generally nearly regular in shape ; occasionally, hoAvever, it is branched or curiously radiated, and then the concretion generally affects a corresponding outline. Calculi containing tAAO oi three nuclei have sometimes been found, consisting probably of an equal number o concretions agglomerated together. A foreign body occasionally takes the place o a nuc eus. The body of a calculus having the uric acid nucleus is usually composed ot some of the lithates ; but not unfrequently these are incrusted by a deposit of phosphates. In other instances, the body may be wholly composed of some of the earthy phosphates, which more rarely alternate AVith the oxalate ot lime or the triple phosphates. ^ ,. An oxalate of lime nucleus iisuaUy has a body of the same constitution ; but in some cases it is incrusted by phosphates or mates (Fig. 710). When the interior is phosphatic, the concretion is always of the same constitution. The alterations in the composition of a calculus are due to vaiwing conditions of the general health, and consequen y of the character and constituents of the urine, and of the f state of the lining membrane of the bladder.

OiUGix.—Calculi may bo formed either in the kidneys or in the bladder. Those that contain nuclei of the urates or oxalates are probably renal in their origin ; whilst those that have a phosphatic nucleus arc usually vesical from the fii-st; renal nuclei of this composition being rarely met with. All renal calculi, all those vesical calculi that have a renal origin, and some of those even that appear to be primarily formed in the bladder, have a consti- tutional source; they arise from a morbid state of the urine, which probably in its turn depends upon mal-assimilation, the peculiar form of which determines the chemical composition of the stone. Those calculi that ai’c formed by deposit from the urine upon and around some foreign body, as a pin or straw accidentally introduced into the bladder, and some soft phosphatic concretions that appear to be the result of an unhealthy state of its mucous membrane, may be looked upon as being local in their origin. Calculi of Renal Origin.—When a stone forms in the pelvis of the kidney, it usually gives rise to pain in the loin. When of small size, it may descend into the bladder with but little suffering to the patient; but, if large enough to mutate the ureter and to pass with some difficulty, it then gives rise to a pecidiar train of symptoms, which will immediately be described. In some cases the calcidus attains a very large size, occupying the whole of the pelvis of the kidney, extending into the calices and lueter, and being moulded, as it were, to the shape of the parts amongst which it lies ; it then gives rise, by its pressui’e, to absorption of the substance of the kidney, and occasions, by the magnitude that it attains, excessive pain and irritation in this region, the patient usually dying, worn out by constant suffering and by the irritation of incurable kidney-disease. In some instances, stone in this situation has given rise to abscess in and around the kidney, and has even been discharged through an aperture in the lumbar region. Descent of Cl Reiicd Gcdculus.—Incases in which a renal calculus descends into the bladder, the patient is seized with pain in the loin that has been the seat of previous in’itation. This pain is usually of the most agonising character, extending into the spermatic cord and testis, and down the inside of the thigh of the afiected side. There is retraction of the testicle, with constipation and vomiting ; fr-equently accompanied by the passage of scanty, high-coloimed, and bloody mine, and gi’eat constitutional distiubance. This pain usually con- tinues of a somewhat remittent chai-acter, imtil the calculus enters the bladder, when, unless expelled, it gives rise to . the train of symptoms peculiar to its presence in that organ.

Calculi of Vesical Origin.—Though a Ycsical calculus often OAves its origin to the descent of a stone from the kidney, yet frequently there is no evidence of its coming from such a soui-ce, but every appearance of its being deposited in the bladder ; a nucleus being originally formed in this viscus by the aggregation of some sabulous matters, around and upon which fr(fsh deposits take place, until a true calculus is formed. In some instances, A'esical calculi have been found deposited upon and incrusting foreign bodies, acci- dentally introduced into the bladder, such as a piece of straw, a pin, a bit of bougie, fragment of bone, &c. NUMBER.—The number of calculi in the bladder A’aries considerably ; most commonly only one is encountered ; but in about one-fifth or one-sixth of the cases operated upon, several will be found ; from two to six or eight are by no means uncommonly met with. Occasionally several dozens have been detected ,- and there are even'instances on record in which some hundreds of distinct and separate calculi have been found in one bladder. The most remarkable case of this kind is one in which Physick remoA'ed from a judge in the United States upwards of a thousand calculi, varying in size from a partridge-shot to a bean, and each marked with a black spot. Several calculi may become „„„ . matted together in one large concretion, as in the aimexed Acid ^Calculi representation of a calculus (Fig. 720) that I removed from a tiier. child foiu’ years old; it was formed of eleven distinct lithic acid calculi soldered together in this Avay ; besides which, three others were lodged in the bladder. When two or more calculi occur, it is remarkable howjmiform they are often in shape, size, and weight, one being the exact counterpart of the other. When there are several calculi in the bladder, the attrition of one against the other usually causes the opposing surfaces to become smooth, thus consti- tuting “ facets ” (Fig. 721). In some cases, however, when the calculi are numerous, there are no signs of attrition. In a patient of mine who had fifteen calculi in his bladder, all the stones were round, about the size and shape of marbles, Avithout any facets. In other cases, again, there may be more facets on one calculus than companion-calculi in Fig. 721.—Calculi with Facets. bladder. A secoiid stone may occasion two or even three facets on the first, having rolled first to one and then to the other side of it. Spontaneous Fracture of a calculus will sometimes occur Aifithin the bladder. This curious phenomenon may happen to a stone that is single, oi to one among several calculi. When it occurs, great iiTitability of the bladdei is set up. There are several Avays of explaining this fracture, or rather dis- integration, of a calculus. Cmale supposes it to occur by the contraction of the hypertrophied coats of the bladder upon the stone. It is possible that, Avhen there are seA'eral calculi in the bladder, the concussion of one against another may give rise to it; and for the breaking up of a calculus to hapiicn, it AA^ould by no means be necessary that this pressure of the bladdei oi concusPHYSICAL GIIAEACTERS OF CALCULI. 759 sion should bo sufficiently strong to resolye the stone at once into fragments. If a crack or fissure merely be formed in it, the infiltration of the lu-ine into this may so soften and loosen its cohesion, that it becomes resolved, without further violence, into a number of pieces. In some instances ^ these become agglomerated together, by the deposit of a quantity of phosphatie matter upon and around them. In other cases, the different fragments may each form the nucleus of a fresh calculus, so that the bladder may afterwards contain numerous concretions. Physical Characters.—The Size of calculi varies from that of a hemp- seed or pin’s head to a concretion of immense magnitude. One of the largest Avith Avhich I am acquainted, was a calculus removed by the high operation by Uytterhoeven of Brussels, Avhich I saiv some time ago in his possession, and of which he has been obliging enough to giA’e me a cast; it is pyriform, and measures 9^ inches in its longest circumference, and 12^ inches round at its broadest part, being inches long, and about 4 wide. In the celebrated case of Sir W. Ogilvie, Cline attempted, but failed, to extract a calculus measuring 1G inches round one axis and 14 round the other. It weighed 44 ounces, and must have been about the size of Uytterhoeven’s. These enormous concretions are happily rarely met with at the present day ; the usual size of stones removed by operation being from about one to two inches in the longest diameter, somewhat naiTOW, and perhaps flattened. The Weight of calculi commonly varies fr’om a few grains to several ounces ; the commonest Aveight is from three drachms to about an ounce or tAvo in weight, occasionally from three to six ; fr’om this they may range upwards until several pounds are reached. Thus, in Cline’s case the stone weighed 44 ounces. Deschamps saw one of 51 ounces, and Morand one weighing Gibs, r none of these admitted of removal. The largest calculi are usually composed of phosphates, in greater part if not in whole. Large and heavy calculi are certainly less frequently met Avith noAV than formerly, owing to operations for stone being simpler and less dreaded since the introduction of aneesthetics, and hence practised in an earher stage of the disease. The Hardness of calculi varies considerably ; the oxalate of lime is the hardest; the lithates come next in consistence, and are often very hard, though brittle; the phosphatie calculi are always comparatively soft and friable. The Shape of calculi presents great A'ariety; most commonly, however, they have an ovoid flgiu’e. Concretions of m’ate of ammonia and uric acid are generally pretty regularly ovoidal, smooth, and disc-like. Those composed of oxalate of lime are usually somewhat globular or square-shaped, and generally rough, nodulated, or spiculated upon the surface. The phosphatie calculi present usually the most irregular outline; most commonly, it is true, they ^e ovoid or globular, but are not unfrequently branched, as if moulded to the interior of the kidney, constricted, or of an hour-glass shape. The cystine calculi are generally tolerably oval and regular in outline. Position. Most frequently calculi lie loose in the bladder; but occasionally they may be flxed, either by being encysted, and then lying in one of the sacculi that have afready been described within the walls of the bladder (Figs. / 22 and 72o); or by being flxed in and embraced by one of the ureters; and m other cases by being deposited upon, and partly included in, fungous groAvths.760 URINARY CALCULUS. Causes.—Whouever a foreign body of any kind, as a piece of broken catheter, &c., is introduced into the bladder, it will form the nucleus of a calculus, speedily becoming incrusted by calculous, probably phosphatic matter. But the causes of calculi occiUTing spontaneously arc very obscure. There can be httle doubt, it is true, that the different forms of concretion are connected with the vai'ieties of diatheses that have already been described ; and we may Fig. 722.—Exterior of Bl.-ulder, containing Fig. 723.—Interior of tlie same Bladder, showing small an Encysted Calculus at n. Orifice leading into Cyst at n ; 6, Ureter. look upon the formation of a calculus as an indication of the existence, in a greater degree of intensity than usual, of the causes which ordinarily give rise to sediments or gTavel; but why, in particular cases, aggregation into a calculous mass takes place, it is impossible to say. Age exercises considerable influence upon the production of calcuh. Stone may occur in the bladder at all periods of life, and even, according to Stahl, may be congenital. The greatest number of cases occin during the fii’st two decennial periods ; thus, Thompson, as the result of his statistical inquhies, states that one-third of the entne number of cases occurs before seven years of age, and one-half of the entire number before the thirteenth year is completed. Coulson has collected 2972 recorded cases of lithotomy from various som-ces; of these, 1466 occinred under the age of ten, 731 from eleven to twenty, 205 from twenty-one to thirty; 264 from thnty-one to fifty, and 306 from fifty- one and upwards. In many of these cases, although the patient was cut towards the middle period of life, the stone probably began to be formed dm’ing childhood. Children belongmg to the wealthy classes are very seldom the subjects of calculus, owing probably to greater care in diet than can be taken mth those of poorer jieople. By many, the absence of milk as an article of diet is supposed to tend to the formation of stone. Sex influences materially the occm’rence of stone, which is far more frequent in the male than in the female, in the proportion of about twenty to one of cases requiring operation. This, however, does not represent the exact ratio; as, owing to the shortness and large size of the urethra in females, many small calculi are voided by them that would be retained in the male. It would appear that in some farts of the ivortcl calculus is a far more common disease than in others. It is generally more frequently met with in cold than in warm climates. The negi’o race is remaikably exempt from this afiection.SYMPT03IS OF STONE IN THE BLADDER. 761 It is a singular fact that in some parts of the same country calculous disorders are of far more frequent occurrence than in others. Thus it is well known that the inhabitants of the east coast of England and Scotland are peculiarly liable to these disorders ; and that in Norfolk stone occurs with especial frequency, the mortality from calculus being much higher here in proportion to the population than in any other county of England (Cadge). In America also, it would appear that the inhabitants of certain States are peculiarly obnoxious to this affection; and I understand that in some districts of Germany the disease may be said to Ije almost unknown, whilst in others it is of common occurrence. The relatiAU frequency of the kinds of calculus also A-aries in different countries. H. Y. Carter, who has analysed and described upwjuds of a hundred specimens contained in the Museum of the Grant Medical College at Bombay, shows that the per-centage of calculi Avith an rn-ic acid or urate of ammonia nucleus is, in India, 5(1’30 ; in England, 71'79 ; Avhile that of calcuh Avith a nucleus of oxalate of lime is in India, 38'6o, in England, IG’87. The calculi composed pmcly of oxalate of lime also greatly exceed in munber those which consist entirely of luic acid or mate of ammonia. To what these differences are OAving it is impossible to say. Peculiarity of race, of con- stitution, and of diet, with exposmn to prevalent easterly Avinds, haA^e all been assigned as reasons for them ; but probably not on very sufficient grounds. SrMPTOJis.—The symjDtoms of stone in the bladder vary according as the calculus lies loose in the caAdty of the auscus or is encysted. Their intensity Avill depend on the size and shape of the stone, the condition of the bladder, and the constitution of the patient. Most commoidy, the severity of the symptoms is in proportion to the magnitude of the calculus. This, however, is not ahvays the case. In a patient whom I once cut, the most intense suffering and repeated attacks of cystitis had been occasioned by a small but sharp-pointed calculus, not weighing more than a drachm; and some years ago I saAv a patient in whose bladder five calculi AA^ere found after death, nearly as large as chestnuts, though their presence had never been suspected during life by the different Smgeons under AA'hose care he had been for stricture, so little distress had they occasioned. In some cases, the symptoms of stone very suddenly declare themselves; and then the Siugeon finds on examination that the patient has a largish calculus, which must have been a long time forming Awthout attracting attention. Bough and angular calculi necessarily give rise to more severe symptoms than smooth ones, owing to their induciiio- a chronic form of cystitis; and as the constitution is usually a good deal shattered and the nervous system very irritable in those conditions of the system in Avhich the phosphates am deposited, phosphatic calculi are usuaUy attended by more local suflering and constitutional disturbance than other forms of the disease. The s^ptoms induced by stone are the result of the mechanical irritation pioduced by the presence of a foreign body in the bladder ; they consist of lam Increased In-equency in Micturition, occasional Stoppage of the Urine and \ arious Morbid Conditions of that Fluid. ^ it symptom that attracts attention • the reo-ioifof tL’^ltlcir^"'’ Th experienced in e„ion of the liLiddei and the permamm, but may radiate Avidely in the762 UBINARY CALCULUS. course of the sacro-hmibar nerves, the patient complaining of a heavy and dragging sensation in the groins, extending down the outside or back of the thighs, and not uncommonly experienced even in the soles of the feet. The penis is the seat of a good deal of uneasiness ; frequently of a shai-p and cutting pain at the end of the glans. This is especially noticed in children, in Avhom attention is often attracted to the complaint by their constantly squeezing and pulling the organ to relieve the distress they suffer in it. The pain is much increased by any movement by which the stone is jolted about in the bladder, as in driving, riding, or jumping ; and is especially severe in those cases in which cystitis occurs. It is always most severe towards the termination of, or immediately after, mictmition ; as there is then a tendency for the calculus to roll forwards towards the neck of the bladder, where it comes into contact with and is grasped by the most sensitive part of that organ. Hence it is not unfrequent, in cases of calculus in childi-en, to find that the little patient instinctively lies upon its back or side whilst passing urine, and thus escapes much of the agony that it would otherwise sufier. In adults in whom the prostate happens to be enlarged, the calculus usually lies in a depression behind this gland ; and hence, being prevented from coming into contact with the neck of the bladder, occasions less suffering than in other cases. In consequence of the irritation set up in the bladder occasioning chronic inflammatory action of the mucous membrane, there is an Increased Frequency of Miciuriiion. The urine is passed frequently, in small quantities at a time, usually contains some mucus or pus, and is occasionally tinged with blood, or loaded with thick vesical mucus. But in many cases the urine remains remarkably clear, transparent, and free from marked admixtiu'es throughout. If the kidneys be irritated, the lu’ine is commonly albuminous. The presence of blood in the lu’ine is often one of the earliest signs of stone in the bladder, and in children especially should lead to the suspicion of the existence of calculus. It may be in large quantities, and may continue for many weeks, especially in the earher stages. The mine may then clear as the bladder becomes accustomed to the presence of the stone, and the blood may only reappear under the influence of active movement, or of any cause of increased uTitation of the organ. But it is important to observe that the quantity of albmnen, as shown by boiling the mine, will continue to be very great. It very rarely happens that a stone has existed for any time, without the mine becoming occasionally streaked or tinged by blood. An occasional Stoppage in the Flmv of Urine before the bladder is emptied commonly occurs, OAving to the stone being impelled against its neck, and thus blocking up the lU’ethra ; but, on the patient lying on his back or on his side, the stream floAVS again, the situation ol the calculus being changed.

Physical Diagnosis of Stone.—The existence of stone is finally deter- mined by Sounding the Bladder. A Sound is a solid steel instrument shaped like a catheter, but shorter in the curve (Fig. 724), so that it may explore thoroughly all parts of the bladder. jTjg. 724.—Souiul for examining BliuUler. especially those behind the prostate. It should have a wide and smooth steel handle, and be slightly bulbous. The operation of sounding is conducted as follows. The patient lies upon his back on a hard mattress ; a full-sized sound, well oiled and wanned, is then passed into the bladder ; which should, if the- patient can retain it, be allowed to contain three or four ounces of urine. The Surgeon then using his left hand, or crossing over to the patient’s right side, whichever he finds most convenient, carefully directs the beak of the instru- ment towai-ds the back of the bladder, turning it fr’om right to left over the whole of that region ; he next draws it forward on one side as fai- as the neck, tapping, as it were, gently with its beak ; he repeats the same manoeuvre on the other side ; and, lastly, directs the end of the instrument by raising its handle into the lower fundus, which he carefully explores. Usually the stone is readily detected by these manceuvres, and its position in the bladder will often be dependent upon, and may to a certain extent be taken as an approxi- mative indication of, its size. Thus, 'when moderately large, it will usually be foimd lying to one side, most generally the right, of the neck of the bladder ; when small, it wiU be placed towards the fundus, near the orifice of one or other ureter. These then are the situations in which the Surgeon should first seek for a stone, and in which he wdll generally find it when present. Should it not be met ■with here, the chances are, more especially if the patient be elderly, that it wuU be found- in a pouch behind the pro- state, where it may be detected by depressing the handle and so tinn- ing the beak of the sound doivnwards (Fig. 725). Should the Surgeon not detect the calculus in r.-„ rss.-SomuUng for stone belnnd Prostate, any ot these situations, he depresses the handle between the thighs, and tilts up the beak so as to examine the pubic portion of the organ (Fig. 720). In the event of his not meeting with a stone, he may direct the patient to stand up, and then he mayURINARY CALCULUS. 764 explore the bladder, first on one side, then on the other. Slionld the rational symptoms of stone be Avell marked, though no calculus be struck, the Singeon must not give a decided opinion in the negative after the first exploration, but should examine the pa- tient again a few days later, with the bladder in different states, as to its contents. In making: this second examination, I have fomid it of gi’eat service to use a hollow steel sound, by which the organ can be injected or emptied at pleasure (Fig. 727). The patient should on this occasion have his bladder injected through such an instru- Fi^. 726.—Sounding for Stone above Pubes. ment aS this, udth folU’ or six ounces of tepid water, so as to distend the organ slightly, and prevent the folds of mucous membrane from overlapping any concretion that may exist in it. Its interior is then carefully explored in the way already described ; and, if the Fig. 727.—Hollow Sound. stone camiot then be detected, the contents of the bladder are gradually allowed to escape through the sound, and the patient is desired to stand up whilst the exploration is being proceeded with. In this way, by examining a patient in different positions and in different conditions of the bladder as to capacity, a calculus is sm-e to be detected if one exist. A hthotrite may occasionally be advantageously used as a sound for the detection of small calculi lying behind the prostate, a situation more readily reached by its short beak than by an instrument of larger ciu’ve. These examinations must not, however, be too pi'otracted ; the time occupied should not exceed above five minutes, lest cystitis be induced. When a stone is struck by the sound, there is not only a characteristic and distinct shock commimicated to the instrument, but' there is heard a tolerably loud click, which can be detected by the bystanders, and frequently by the patient, as well as by the Siugeon. By conducting the sounding properly, the Sm-geon may usually ascertain not only the existence of a stone, but its size and hardness ; Avhether it be single, if it be encysted, and the general state of the bladder ; with all of which it is of importance that he should be acquainted before undertaking any operation. A good deal of this information may be elicited by the ordinary sound, but some of the points can only be accurately determined by sounding wdth the lithotrite.765 SOUNDING THE BLADDER. Fig. 72s.—Soumliiig for Encysteil Calculus. one situation ; and if the beak of the instrument cannot be made to pass round it, so as to isolate it, but a kind of tumom- projecting through the walls of the bladder is felt, around or on one side of the point where the calculus is struck. The fasciculated, roughened, and sacculated condition of the Madder may generally be detected by the Avay in which the beak of the instrument gTates and rubs over the organ. The size of the calculus is best determined by a lithotrite. It is true that a Surgeon may sometimes come to a decision as to the bulk of a calculus, by observing the extent of surface along which the sound is in contact with the stone, as the instrument is being withdrawn. But a very rough guess only can be aiTived at in this way ; and I have frequently seen very experienced Sur- geons deceived in their estimate of the size of a calculus, mistaking perhaps several small ones lying together for one large one. By introducing a litho- trite and seizing the calculus gently between its blades, a correct estimate of its size may always be arrived at. In order to determine that severed calculi exist in the bladder, it is sometimes sufficient for the Surgeon to feel that the beak of the sound comes into contact with a stone on each side of the organ, or that it ean be distinctly insinuated between two concretions. In some cases, however, these points cannot clearly be made out; and then the Surgeon, introducing a lithotrite and seizing the first calculus with which he meets, should hold this between the blades of the instrument, and whilst it is so fixed move it and the lithotrite from side to side ; when, if a elick be heard and felt, he may be sm’e of the existence of another stone. Sounding is by no means destitute of danger, more especially if roughly done, or in patients who have chronic kidney-disease. In the first case it may766 URINARY CALCULUS. give rise to cystitis or profuse and continuous hiemorrhage ; in tlic second, to rigors and nrteinia. ’ Errors in Sounding occasionally occur. The Surgeon may mistake a hardened and fasciculated bladder, having its ridges perhaps incrusted with phosphatic sabulous matter, for a calculus j this is especially apt to happen in children. In these cases, however, the mistake may usually be guarded agaiirst by the absence of a distinct click, though a rough grating sensatioir be expe- rienced, and by the Surgeon being unable to isolate a stone. Yet the difficulty in some cases is great; Velpeau states that he is acquainted with four instances, and S. Cooper with seven, in which patients have been cut and no calcidus found ; and Avhen rve reflect that these accidents have happened to such men ■as Cheselden, rvho on three occasions cut a patient and found no stone, to Crosse, to Eoux, and to Dupuytren, it is easy to understand that in some cases the difficulty of coming to a correct decision must be very great. In ivommi the symptoms of stone closely resemble those met with in men, and the detection of the calculus is usually very easy, orving to the shortness -of the canal and the facility rvith which the stone may be tilted up by intro- ducing the fingers of the left hand into the vagina. The sound used in these cases should be shorter and less curved than that employed for the detection of calculus in the male bladder. Pathological Changes induced by Calculus.—After a stone has existed for some time in the bladder, it induces serious pathological changes in the whole of the urinary apparatus. The urethra usually becomes slightly dilated; and the prostate not unfrequently somewhat enlarged and irritable, in conse- quence of which a kind of pouch is formed behind it, in which the calculus is apt to lodge. The most important changes, howeiBr, take place in the bladder and kidneys. The Madder becomes extremely sensitive, especially about its neck, and is consequently unable to contain as much urine as usual ; hence it becomes contracted. In some rare instances, however, as wiU be more especially noticed when ive come to speak of lithotrity, it falls into an atonic condition, and then is apt to become rather largely dilated. The mucous membrane is commonly a good deal inflamed and irritated by the presence of the calculus; and the muscular coat becomes thickened and hypertro- phied, so as to give it a very fasciculated or colunmated appearance. Cysts occasionally form, containing sabulous matter and fetid pus or urine, and in some cases lodging a concretion, which then constitutes an encysted calculus lying altogether outside the cavity of the bladder, ivith which it merely com- mmiicates by a very narrow aperture, as in Figs. 722 and 723, representing a case that was under my care some years ago, and ivhich is fully described in the Journals for March, 1853. The hidmijs are usually ii-ritated, often con- gested, frequently in a state of granular degeneration, and ultimately become the seat of such structural changes as are incompatible with life. VTien death occurs as the consequence of stone, the patient usually sinks, ivorn out by pro- tracted suffering and kidney-disease. LITHOTOMY. It is not my intention to enter into the general history of lithotomy, an operation that has been practised from the earliest ages ; nor to give a sketch767 INSTRUMENTS FOR LITHOTOMY. Qp PljQ ^rudiitil motlific^fcions tlint Iirvg n^fc Vcinous times l)Gcn iiitiocliicecl^ ftom tliG rnde attempts of the Greek and Roman Surgeons to the i^arbarous and unscientific iiroccdures adopted by the itinerant operators after tlie re^•ival ol letters. For all this, I would refer the reader to the classical Avorks of Des- champs and of John Bell. The operation, as now generally practised in this country, is essentially that introduced by Cheselden, and modified more or less according to the A'iews of particular Surgeons. Though Surgeons generally are agreed upon the great principles involved in it, they differ in carrying these out; as in the direction and extent of the incisions, and in the instruments employed, which have been much varied to suit the tastes and views of parti- cular operators. But, although I look upon Chesclden’s operation, as modified and practised by Liston, as being on the whole the simplest and safest mode of cutting for the stone as yet introduced, there can be no doubt that recourse may occasionally be had Avith advantage to other methods instead of it. Indeed, there is no operation that requires to be considered from so many and such different points of view as lithotomy. The size, shape, and position of the stone, the age and constitution of the patient, all render it desirable, and indeed necessary, to modify the method of operating. Hence, a Surgeon should not be too exclusively wedded to one plan, but should adopt one or other of the methods about to be described, according to the exigencies of the particular case before him. Instruments.—The table for operating must be firm and of conA'enient height, so that when the Surgeon sits on a rather Ioav stool the patient’s nates AA-ill be on a level with his breast; a few blankets doubled should be laid upon the table, and covered by a piece of tarpaulin hanging over the end ; and a tray of sand placed under it on the floor. The instruments necessary are the foUoAving a pair of lithotomy tapes, a sharp and probe-pointed scalpel, a staff, forceps, and scoops of various sizes, and a tube. To these may be added a searcher, and a brass injecting syringe. The tapes should be of coarse flannel, about three yards long, by thi-ee inches broad. An inflnite amount of ingenuity has been expended in giving variety to the shape of the knives used for opening the deeper portions of the urethra and neck of the bladder in lithotomy. Instruments of this kind, straight-edo-ed and shouldered, beaked and probe-ended in every possible Avay, have been deAu'sed ; and each has had its special advocate, but has seldom been adoi^ted jn practice by any except its inventor. All these modifleations of the ordinarv scalpel are, to say the least, useless ; some, perhaps, actually dangerous. They simply seek to supply by mechanical means that safety in the deeper incisions which may as readily be secured by a broad-bladed, straight-backed scalpel if properly guided by a hand that is ordinarily skilful.

The cutting gorget, formerly much in vogue, is all but miiversally discarded as a most dangerous tool by the modern lithotomist. ^ (HscardedURTNAIiY CALCULUS. 768 The scalpel for the adult may he of the size and the shape represented 720); for children, it may be made smaller.

YhQ forceps must not be too heavy, but should be of a good length in the handles, and have the joint well set back ; the inside of the blades, as recom- mended by Liston, should be lined with linen to prevent the stone from slipping (Fig. 782). Coxeter has made them with open blades, but lined Fig. 731.—Opeu-bladed Litliotomy-forceps, lined.witli linen. with linen as heretofore (Fig. 731); in this way, as there is less metal, the weight is diminished, and the diameter of the instrument with a stone in its grasp is materially lessened.

The searcher is a slightly curved sound, having a bulbous ex- tremity (Fig. 737). The syringe should be j)rovided with Gross’s ball nozzle, which ]iropcls a reversed current. In describing the operation of lithotomy, we shall first of all examine seriatim the different steps of an operation that presents no unusual complica- tion or difficulty; Ave shall then consider the difficulties that may be met with, and the accidents that may occur dm-ing the operation, and the principal sources of danger and the causes of death after its performance. Preparation of the Patient.—Before subjecting a patient to operation, his general health must be properly attended to ; and, indeed, if we find the constitution much broken by prolonged suffering, the bladder or kidneys seriously diseased, as indicated by the existence of pus or albumen in large quantity in his urine, it will be wise to postpone the operation for a time, or perhaps even to defer it altogether. There are few conditions in Avhich a Sm’- geon is placed, that test his moral coimage more severely than the refusal to operate on a patient for stone, and thus allowing him to die unrelieved. For a Sm-geon to do this, unmoved by the entreaties of the patient and of his fi'iends, requires no little self-reliance. Yet, when the patient is greatly emaciated, his constitution broken doAvn, and his kidneys evidently disor- ganised extensively, lithotomy would be attended by an inevitably and rapidly fatal result, and the performance of an operation would be an useless act of cruelty. Supposing, however, that the stone is of moderate size, that the urine is either healthy or contains but a moderate quantity of pus or albumen, that there is no visceral complication to prevent the performance of the ojDera- tion, and that the patient’s health is in a tolerably good state, it will only be necessary to subject hiin to proper preparative treatment for a short time, so as to allay or remove irritability of the urinary organs before jrroceeding with it. With this view he'should be kept as quiet as possible for about a week or ten days preceding the operation ; his diet should be properly regulated, but not too low ; the pain should be lessened by the administration of opiates or henbane, and the bowels properly relieved. On the day preceding the opera- tion, a dose of castor-oil or some other aperient should be administered ; and on the morning of the operation the rectum must be emptied by means of an enema. Lateral Operation.—AU the urine contained in the bladder having been draA\n off, that organ should be filled by the injection of about six or eight ounces of tepid water, in order to steady it and' to facilitate the seizure and extraction of the stone. xYfter chloroform has been administered, the Surgeon should introduce a full-sized staff, which he uses as a sound, in order to feel tor the calculus. If he detects it, he proceeds ivith the operation; if he cannot detect It, It IS usually recommended that he should ivithdi-aw the staff and mtroduce a sound, with wliich he examines the bladder ; and, in the event of his stiiliaihng to discover the presence of the stone, the operation must be deterred, for it is an imperative rule in surgeiy that lithotomy should never bo performed unless the stone can be felt at the time Avhen the patient is actually 3d770 URINARY CALCULUS. on the table. It is, however, safer not to proceed with the operation unless the stone can he felt with the staff; lest the point of this, though apparently in the bladder, be actually engaged in a false passage. The stone, then, having been felt, the patient is to be firmly tied up and brought to the end of the table, so that his nates project beyond it, where he is to be securely held on each side by an assistant, who grasps the foot in his hand, places the patient’s knee under his arm, and draws the limb well aside, so that the perinmimi may be fairly exposed. It is desirable that the perinaeum be thus fully exposed to the Surgeon. In a patient, however, on whom I once operated, this could not be done, owng to the left hip being stiffened by chronic rheumatic arthritis ; but I did not experience any particular difficulty in the operation, though somewhat in- convenienced by the position of the limb. The Surgeon then, seating himself before the patient, shaves the perinaeum—if this have not already been done—and in- troduces his finger into the rectum to ascertain that the gut is empty. He then gives the staff into the charge of a trusty assistant, who stands on the patient’s left, and who raises and draws aside the scrotum with the left hand whilst he holds the staff in the right (Fig. 738). The Surgeon then sees that the staff is held in the way in vffiich he prefers it. There are two ways in which it may be held ; it may either be drawn well up into the arch of the pubes, or it may be pushed somewhat down, and slightly tmuied towards the left of the peringeum. Liston always employed the first method, which I certainly think is the best, as it tends to increase the space be- tween the lu’ethra and the rectum, and consequently lessens the danger of wounding that gut, which more than counterbalances the advantage of the other method—that of approaching the membranous portion of the urethra to the surface. The external incision is made by entering the knife in the raphe of the peri- nteum, one inch and a half above the anus, and cariying it downwards and outwards, until it reaches a point that is just below the anus, but about one- third nearer to the tuberosity of the ischium than to the margin of the anal aperture (Fig. 738). It is useless to prolong the incision beyond this, as any freer division of the structures of the scrotum and on the nates cannot facili- > tate the extraction of the stone ; but it must occupy the extent indicated, otherwise considerable difficulty may be experienced in the later steps of the operation. The depth to which this incision should be caiTied must vary ! according to the obesity of the subject; usually from about three quarter of ' an inch to an inch, but not so deeply above as below. By this incision the j Fig. 738.—Position of Patient and Line of Incision in Lateral Lithotomy.3 D 2 INCISIOXS IN LATERAL OPERATION. 77t Fig. —Lateral Lithotomy : Fiiiger-iiail in Groove of the Staff. skin, superficial fascia, subcutaneous fat, and inferior htemoiTlioidal vessels, are dinded. After it is completed, the knife is again introduced a little below the upper part of the -wound, and the blade is run lightly doAvn-wards over any resisting structures ; the left fore-finger being placed at the middle of the tvound, so as to protect the rectum. In this way the transversalis perinmi muscle is di\ided, together with some areolar tissue and small vessels, and the triangular space is opened between the accelerator urinm and erector penis muscles. The lower border of the triangular liga- ment is notched so as to open up the space between the two layers of the triangular liga- ment, in which the mem- branous part of the urethra hes. The knife is then with- draAvn, and the left index-finger is pushed deeply into this space until the edge of the nail is lodged in the groove of the staff (Fig. 789), Avhich can be felt just anterior to the prostate, thinly covered by the membranous portion of the urethra. The point of the knife is then pushed through the urethra at its [membranous part into the groove of the staff, above the index-finger, which protects and presses to the right the rectum lying beneath it (Figs. 740 and 741). l^Tien the knife is felt to be well lodged in the groove, its handle is slightly depressed, so that the point may be raised ; at the same time the blade should be somewhat lateralised so that its side lies parallel to the ramus of the ischimn. If the edge be turned too directly downwards towards the mesial line, the rectum may be Avounded ; and if it be directed too much outAvards the in- ternal pudic artery will be endangered (Fig. 742); hence the mid coiu'se is the proper one. The Surgeon, keeping the knife steadily in this position, and pressing the point firmly against the side of the groove of the staff, Avhich he must never for a moment lose, pushes it forwards through the deep perineal fascia, a fcAV fibres of the levator ani, and the prostate, and thus makes an entry into the bladder (Fig. 741) j he then withdraws the knife by keeping its back against the staff, so as not to enlarge the extent of the incision in the prostate.

Tlirough this, and along the staff,URINARY CALCULUS. 772 he then pushes his left index-finger until it reaches the bladder, n-hen he endeaA’onrs to feel the calcnlns with its tip. Should his finger be short, the iiorimenin deep, or the prostate enlarged, he may be unable to reach the bladder in this way ; and mnst then introduce a blunt gorget, as recommended by Chcseldcn and Martineau, in order to dilate the aperture in the prostate. If he use his finger for this purpose, he gives it a tm'st or two after passing it through the prostate, so as to expand and dilate the aperture through which it is entered. Having made sure that it is in the bladder, and haHng, if possible, felt the stone, he directs the assistant to withdraw the staff from the urethra. Here let ns pause, and examine the principal points in these the first and second stages of the operation. It will be observed that, in accordance with the best authorities upon this subject, and with my own experience, I have recommended the external incision to be free, the rectum to be protected by the left index-finger, the knife to be somewhat lateralised dm-ing and after the opening of the urethra, and the deep incision to be limited. _ 1. The Position of the Knife must be carefully attended to, especially din’ing the deep or second incision. At this stage of the operation the edge should be lateralised; that is, directed about midway between the horizonta and pei-pendicular positions, so that the sin-face of the blade lies nearly paraUel to the ramus of the ischium. The manner of holding the knife has been much discussed, and necessarily and natinally varies with different Surpons. i believe it signifies little how the handle of the instrument is held between theMANNER OF HOLDING THE KNIFE. 773 Surgeon’s fingers, proncled the edge be never turned upwards, but be always kept well lateralised, and the point steadily pressed into the groove of the staff. Provided a Sui’geon know Avliat he as best suits liis own con^'enience. In the fii’st incision, most operators, I behcA'c, hold the knife under the hand, as reijrescnted in Fig. 748 ; a position which that excellent lithotomist and accomplished Smgeon, Fergusson, pre- serves throughout the operation. Lis- ton, in the early part of his career, appears to have held the knife, in the second stage of the operation, above the hand; and in all the representations, published as weU as mipubhshed, that he has left off his operation, he has de- picted the kinfe and hands in the ' position shown in Fig. 744 ; which, in the last edition of his Practical Surgery, he describes as a correct sketch of “ the position of the hands and knife ” at the commencement of the second stage of is about, ho may safely hold his knife Fig. 742.—Arteries of Periiifeum and Deep Fascia. the operation. There can be no doubt, however, as Fergusson has pointed out, that in actual practice, at least after his first few years as an operator, he held the knife under the hand, with the index-finger upon the side or the back of the blade. For my own part, I behove that every Surgeon will hold the knife in the Fig. 7iS.—Position of Hand and Knife (Fergusson). Fig. 744.—Position of Hand and Knife (Liston). way which he finds most convenient, and, as it were, natural to him. If any rules can be laid down on this point, I should say that, in operating on a child, or on an adult -with a shallow peri- naeum, the knife is most com'eniently held as represented in Fig. 745. But if the patient be fat, and the peri- nasum deep, then I think that it is a question whether greater steadiness may not sometimes be secured by Position of Ilnnd and Knife (.VutUor). holding the knile somewhat in the manner of a gorget, with the index-finger.774 UIUSAltY CALCULUS. perhaps a little more upon the side of the handle (Figs. 741 and 745 ); in this way the point is firmly pressed into tlm gi-oove of the stafh out of which it cannot slip, as it is secured and supported by the index-finger being some- what under it. The section of the prostate is thus made by a steady push or thrust of the knife forwards, and not by any cutting movement downwards. No danger can result in the deep incision from pushing the point of the knife up into the groove of the staff; but there is great danger of missing the bladder, and entering the recto-vesical space, if it be at all depressed and the handle raised, though this cannot always be avoided if the staff be pushed deeply into the bladder. 2. The Incision into the Prostate in the adult should be of very limited extent: on this point, I believe, all Surgeons of the present day are agreed. Scarpa advises that the incision into it should not exceed five lines in adults, and two in children. It is difficult to measure the extent of the incision: it is sufficient to say, that it should be as limited as possible; and if care bo taken to push the knife in, with the point w’ell pressed against the groove, and the l)lade forming but a hmited angle with the shaft of the staff, and especially in Avithdrawing it that it be brought carefriUy back over the finger and still in contact with the instrument, there will be no danger in cutting too Avidely, or in doing more than merely notching the apex of the prostate (Fig. 746 a). The danger, however, it must be borne in mind, does not consist in the section of the prostate itself—AA'hich is in reality a structure of but little importance —^but in cutting beyond it into the reflections of the pelvic fasciae, which AviU be opened up if the base of the prostate be cut, and the wound of which Avill, almost to a certainty, be followed by m-inary infiltration and diffuse inflammation. That distinguished anatomist Elhs has, I beheve, for many years taught that the true separation be- tAveen the cavity of the pehns and the internal parts, in Avhich a lithotomy wound can be safely made, is not the sheath of the prostate, but the lateral and anterior true ligaments of the bladder; or in other words, the recto-vesical fascia. Hence the incision may be safely car- ried thi-ough the whole length of the loAver and outer side of the prostate up to the very neck of the bladder, provided it do not pass beyond the at- Fig. 746.-inci3ion in Prostate. tachmciit of the lateral liga- ment to the bladder, and so open up the loose _ subperitoneal tissue around i In the section of the prostate, then, two points have specially to be attende to : one is, that the knife in entering be not pushed angle Avith the staff, so as to cut AVidely; and the other is, that indilatation of the prostate. 775 drawal the blade be kept steadily in contact with the staff. Indeed, I believe that there is more danger of doing mischief in the withdrawal than in the entry of the knife; for,‘If it leave the staff for a moment, all guide is lost, and the edge may sweep doumwards through the base of the prostate and its investing capside. As the knife is withdrawn, the left index-finger is pushed forward^into the aperture in the prostate, which is then dilated by its pressure to a sufficient extent for the introduction of the forceps, which are slipped in as the finger is withebrawn, and for the extraction of the stone. This part of the operation may very conveniently be performed, as was usually done by Liston, at the moment when the Surgeon is stooping down, engaged in selecting his forceps. The dilatation of the prostate is readily effected; for this structiire, though dense, is friable, and breaks down easily under somewhat forcible pressure by the finger. In this way, by a mere notching of the pro- state,—by a slight section of its apex or urethral surface, followed by simple dilatation with the finger,—sufficient space will be obtained for the extraction of all moderate-sized calculi, without the employment of any violence, or the infliction of any bruising upon the tissues. But another obstacle exists which will prevent the dilatation of the neck of the bladder to any veiy material extent, without an amount of bruising, or laceration, or even rupture that would probably prove fatal to the patient. This obstacle consists of a firm resisting tissue, which has been described by Tyrrell as “ an elastic ring,” siuTounding the neck of the bladder; by Liston as “ a fibrous or ligamentous band siuTounding the orifice of the bladder, into which the muscular fibres of the organ are inserted.” If this ring or band be ruptured, either by the finger or by the expansion of the forceps, fatal consequences vdll ensue ; but if it be divided, the other tissues, as Liston observes, will yield to an inconceivable extent, without injury to the ilio-vesical fascia. The division of this ring must only be practised co a very limited extent. I beheve that it is always affected in the act of pushing the scalpel inwards into the bladder ; a mere notching of the fibres of the ring, indeed, is sufficient to allow the requisite expansion to talze place when pressure is applied. In thus describing the mode of incising the prostate and neck of the bladder, I have, generally, used the term “dilatation ;” and I believe that, by a simple process of dilatation or expansion of these parts, and without any violence whateA'er, small calculi of or under on inch in diameter may be extracted. In fact, for the removal of such stones, no force whatever is required, either in opening up the prostate or in withdi’awing the calculus. But, in removing stones of greater magnitude than this, I believe that the process of expansion of the prostate and neck of the bladder, whether effected by the finger, by a blunt gorget, or by the opening up of the blades of the forceps, is a process of laceration rather than of dilatation, as I have fi'equently had occasion to observe in experiments on this point made on the dead subject. If this laceration be, however, confined to the substance of the prostate, and do not extend through the lateral ligament of the bladder, and into the fasciae of the pelvis, no hann results. It is difficult, with ordinary force, to lacerate the dense ligament. This structure, therefore, remains as a firm unbroken barrier be- tween the pelvic fasciae and the external wound, preventing the possibility ofUlilNAEY CALCULUS. 776 the infiltration of nvinc into the internal subperitoneal areolar tissue, and lessening materially the chance of the extension of diffuse inflammation into the pelvic fasciaj. But if, in the withdrawal of the stone, or by an undue expansion of tlie blades of the forceps, the Sin-geon feel a sudden giving way of a tense annular structure, he may be sure that the lateral ligaments have been torn, and that fatal mischief will ensue. Extraction of the Stone.—A forceps of sufficient length, and of a size proportioned to that of the calculus, and previously warnred by immersion in tepid water, must be slid along the index-finger, which is kept in the wound, and by which the neck of the bladder should be drawn somewhat down so as to meet the instrument. In this way, also, the stone may often be fixed Ijy the point of the finger, and its position thus acciu-ately determined. The forceps having been introduced closed, the finger is withdrawn, when a gush of urine Avill usually take place through the wound, if that fluid have not already escaped at the time when the incision is made through the prostate. By this gush the calculus may, as Fergusson observes, sometimes be carried into the gi’asp of the instrument; most commonly, however, the stone requires to be felt for with the closed forceps. When its position has been ascertained, usually at the inferior fundus, the blades of the instrument are opened ; and, by pushing one against the wall of the bladder, and giving it a slight shake, the calculus generally drops between them; though occasionally it is somewhat troublesome to seize, and this, indeed, often constitutes the most tedious and annoying part of the operation. The blades, having the stone in their grasp, are then closed, and the stone is drawn do^vnwards through the womid. If it be small, it may be extracted at once without any difficulty ; if it Ido of moderate size, the finger should be introduced along the blades, in order to feel whether it is in a proper position for extraction. If its long axis lie across the wound, this must be changed ; and it must then be withdravm by a kind of to-and-fro movement in the direction of the axis of the pebds (Fig. 717). Should unfortunately the stone be broken, or shoifld there be several small calculi, the fragments or the small calculi may generally be best removed by means of the scoop (Fig. 748). In the event of fr’actm'e occurring, it null be necessary to wash out the bladder freely and repeatedly with tepid water, injected by means of a brass syringe through a tube introduced by the wound. If the perinteum be very deep, and the pros- • f tate enlarged, it may Fic. 747.—Direction of Forceps m Extraction of stone. ,, 7 ^ e happen that the neck oi the bladder is so far removed from the sm-face that the finger cannot reach ILITIIOTOME Foil LATERAL LITIIOTOMI. 777 its interior. In these circumstances, the Surgeon must be the forceps, that the instrument do not slip to the side of the incision, tlie guide and support of the index- finger being lost. In two or three cases of this kind that have occun-ed to me, in which, owing to the anatomical leasons above stated, 1 could not reach the bladdei with tlie tip of my fore-finger, I have directed the assistant who held the staff not to withdraw it, but, using it as a o-uide, have slipped the forceps along its gToove and over its concavity, in this way making it enter the bladder with the greatest ease and certainty. This manoeim-e I would strongly recommend in the cases alluded to. It is of the first importance to extract the stone whole without breaking it, or even chipping fragments from it with the blades of the forceps. ISFo effort consistent with the safety of the patient should be spared in obtaining this desirable result; not for the sake of any v^ain display of manual skill, but from Fig. 74S.—Position of Finger and Scoop in E.'ctracting Stone. a regard to the well-being of the patient. If the stone become broken by the attempt at extraction, what happens ?' The Surgeon is obliged to introduce repeatedly the forceps and the scoop in his attempts to clear the bladder ; the mucous membrane of which, falling upon and em^eloping the fragments, is liable to be pricked, bruised, and excoriated in the endeavom’ to seize them. The bladder requires to be frequently washed out with copious injections of tepid water, and the operation thus becomes greatly and dangerously prolonged. Even after much time and labour have been spent in these efforts, fragments are apt to be left behind which may occasion great present irritation, and, if retained, will form the nuclei of future recurrent calculi. In children, and indeed in most cases in which the perinamm is not very deep, so that after the introduction of the finger the stone can be felt and hooked forwards, the scoop is a most convenient instrument for its extraction ; and in these cases I have often employed it iir preference to the forceps. After the calculus has been removed, it must be examined for facets, or the interior of the bladder explored by means of a searcher ; and if other stones be found, they must be dealt with in the same way as the first. The gum-elastic iule may then be introduced, and secured with tapes to a band round the patient’s abdomen. This tube must be kept fr-ee from coagula by the introduction into it, fi'om time to time, of the feather of a pen. The tube is of great service by preventing the womid fr-om becoming blocked up by coagula, and the free escape of the urine consequently interfered with. By means of this tube a ready outlet is given to the urine, the chance of infiltration is lessened, and if there be haamorrhage the wound may readily be plugged round it. Lithotome for Lateral Lithotomy.—Surgeons have, at various times, expended much ingenuity on the construction of instruments calculated to facilitate the operation of lithotomy, and to enable the operator to make his incision with absolute precision. Most Siu-geons prefer to rely on their own skill to accomplish this, and mechanical contrivances have very generally and778 URINARY CALCULUS. perhaps somewhat unjustly been discarded. Of all the instruments of the kind refen-ed to, that which is the invention of N. ll. Smith, of Baltimore, is the most ingenious and practically useful, ’ This instrument consists of a staff with appliances (Fig, 749), and a pecu- liarly shaped bent cutting gorget (Fig, 750). It was first described and figured by Smith in 1831. It has undergone many modifications at the hands of its inventor, and is now given to the pro- fession with all its improvements, as seen in Figs. 749 and 750. The staff consists of three parts. 1. A rectangular tubular staff, with a wide ’ slit making a quarter turn, so as to fit it for lateral lithotomy. 2. Attached to the staff by a hinge close under the handle, is an “ arm-piece,” or “ conductor.” This ends in a knife-blade, set at right angles to the shaft and deeply grooved at its under part. 3. An “ indicator ” consists of a slender rod traversing the handle of the staff and terminating in a cup sliding in the tubular staff. The mode of action of the instrument is as follows. The conductor being drawn back on its hinge, the rectangular staff is passed in the usual way into the bladder, the angle being brought just in front of the prostate and resting on the mem- *''°'coiiductor*^^* branous part of the methi’a. When the Fig. 750 (to right).—Smitii’s Gorget. Sm’geon has Satisfied himself that the staff is in proper position, he draws down the conductor, and, pressing upon it, pushes its terminal knife through the tissues of the perinmum until it enters the slit in the staff. The groove in the “ conductor ” outside the perinfeum is now continuous with that in the staff which is in the urethra. The “indicator ” is now draAvn up so that its cup lies immediately under the groove of the “ conductor.” The superficial inci- sion having been made in the usual way, the methra is opened on the groove in the “ conductor ;” the beak of the knife is then engaged in the cup of the “ indicator,” and as the knife advances the rod of the indicator descends, but ceases to move if the blade depart from the proper route by slipping out of the slit in the staff and stops when the end of the groove is reached. The knife, oi* gorget (Fig. 750), ends in a blunt beak, and the handle is sot at an angle to the blade, so as to enable the Sm’geon to watch more accurately its attitude and position. Professor Johnson, of Baltimore, has used this instrument many times, and speaks highly of its utility. After-treatment of Lithotomy.—After the operation, the patient mustLATERAL LITHOTOMY IH BOYS. 779 be removed to a bed, which should be properly aiTanged by having a largo square of :Maciutosh cloth put across it. On this a folded sheet should be laid, which must be rolled up on the further side, so that, as it becomes wetted by the escape of urine, it may be drawn across irom under the patient. This niiist be changed frequently in order to keep him clean and dry. A full dose of tincture of opium in barley-water should then be given ; a waim flannel laid across the abdomen ; plenty of barley- or giun-water allowed for drink, and nothing but rice-milk or light pudding for diet durmg the first three or four days. After this some broth may be allowed, and the quality of the food gi-adually improved. Occasionally, however, it may be necessary to depart from this routine system of dieting the patient after lithotomy ; and I have, with great advantage, allowed wine, and e\'en brandy, a day or two after the operation. At the end of thirty-six or forty-eight hours the tube may be removed, the sides of the incision by that time having become glazed over, and little danger of infiltration existing. The patient, who up to this time has been lying on his back, should then be directed to change his posture, first to one side and then to the other. The buttocks and hips should be well oiled, so as to prevent the irritating effects of the luinary drainage. The urine continues to flo^v entirely through the wound for the first foim or five days. About this time it frequently suddenly ceases to do so, escaping by the urethra. This is owing to the prostate becoming tiu'gid by inflammatory action, and thus blocking up the aperture in it; but as this swelling goes down, in the course of a day or two, the urine usually escapes by the wound again, and continues to do so in gTadually decreasing quantities until the aperture is finally closed, which usually happens at about the end of fourteen or eighteen days ; though in patients who have suffered from phosphatic calculus it sometimes takes a longer period, owing to the broken state of the general health. Should the wound fall into a sloughy state, the patient must be put on a very generous diet, even a free allowance of stimulants : and the tinctime of benzoin may l)e daily applied. When slow of healing, it may be stimulated with nitrate of silver apphed to the bottom ; and, should a fistulous apertirre be left, that may be touched with the electric cautery. After the operation, appropriate constitutional treatment should be continued for some time in order to prevent a recurrence of the disease. Lateral Lithotomy in Boys under the age of puberty is, perhaps, the most successful of all the great operations in surgery. It is performed much in the same way as in the male adult ; there are, however, some points of modification or of difference in the operation when pi’actised on young subjects. The following arc worthy of note, and should be remembered by the Surgeon in proceeding to operate on children. 1. Ihe urethra in boys AviU commonly be found larger than would perhaps at first be expected from their age, readily admitting a No. 8 or i) staff. 2. fihe perinajum is usually proportionately more vascular in boys, in consequence of the straining produced by the inltation of the calculus. ?}. 'J.herc is often from the same cause a tendency to prolapsus of the rectum.780 UlUNAliY CALCULUS. 4. As the prostate is a rudimentary organ in the boy, the deep incision necessarily passes, in most cases, beyond its limits into the neck of the bladder. b. In boys the tissues are more yielding, and more readily lacerable under the finger. 0. d'be most important point, however, is, that in the boy the bladder lies high, being rather in the abdomen than in the pelvis ; hence, it is of import- ance to raise the point of the knife somewhat more than in the adult in making the deep incision, and to be careful that it do not slip into the tissues between the rectum and the bladder, which may happen unless this precaution be taken. I have known this to occur in several instances to Hospital Sm-geons of skill and experience, the forceps being passed into this space under the supposition of its being the bladder ; and in every case the patient died unrelieved. This accident is the more likely to happen, because in boys the parts are very yielding, and readily admit of being pushed before the knife or finger ; and the finger may thus pass between the neck of the bladder and the pubes, or into the loose areolar tissue between the rectum and the bladder. The urethra being opened, urine escapes ; and the Surgeon introduces his finger into a dis- tinct cavity, which he believes to be the interior of the bladder, but which is not so, but the recto-vesical space. ’ The liability to the occurrence of this dis- tressing and fatal accident is materially lessened by injecting the bladder fully with tepid water, by which it is steadied and brought lower down. But in young boys lithotomy is from this cause always an anxious operation. It falls to the lot of but few Sm’geons of experience in hthotomy to pass through an active professional life without meeting with difficulty and anxiety in operating on boys ; and when such an untoward accident ocems, those will be the most charitable in their judgment of others, who have themselves had the most experience in the operation and have had most frequently to en- counter its intrinsic difficulties. In order, then, to obviate the special dangers that have just been mentioned as likely to occiu' in the lateral lithotomy of boys, the following points should be attended to. 1. The bladder should be injected with two or three ounces of tepid water. 2. The point of the knife, wfoen it has entered the groove of the staff, should be kept very fii-mly pressed against its side, and carried somewhat upwards instead of straight forwards. 3. When the knife is laid aside and the Sm’geon proceeds to pass his finger into the bladder, he will find the following manoeuvre to facilitate this step of the operation very greatly, and lessen materially the danger of ^ pushing the neck of the bladder before him. Placing the nail of the left index in the groove of the staff j he should not carry it along the convexity of this instrument, but, shdiug it over to the concave side, gently but steadily work his way along this into the bladder. In doing so, he passes the finger between the roof of the urethra, which is a fixed part of the canal, and the staff", mstead of between this and the fioor of the urethra, which is mobile and yieldmg. There is the additional advantage that, by pressing dovm the staff as the finger goes above it, the urethra and neck of the bladder are somewhat dilated._ 4. So soon as the finger enters the bladder and the staff is withdravm, the781 DIFFICULTIES DURING LITHOTOMY. calculus should he fixed Avith its point against the floor of the bladder, where it may then be seized easily by the forceps. . , „ i i n Dii'TicuiiTrES Lithotojiy.—The difficulties before and during the operation are three-fold ; 1, in Finding the Stone ; 2, in Entering the Bladder ; and 3, in Seizing and Extracting the Calculus. 1. Difficulty in Finding the Stone, either by the staff or the sound, may exist before commencing the operation ; and sometimes it is impossible to find the stone, although its presence may have been distinctly and incontestably ascertained a few days pre^'iously. In these circumstances, the Surgeon must on no account be tempted to proceed with the operation 5 but, aftei a carefully conducted exploration has failed to elicit the actual piesence of the stone, all further proceedings must be deferred to another opportunity. The stone may escape detection in three ways. 1. It may have been passed by the urethra, between the first examination and the time fixed for the operation. A small calculus, especially if elongated and spindle-shaped, may give a very distinct click against the sound, and yet be not too large to pass through the urethra. 2. The stone may have become encysted. 3. It may have become enveloped in folds of the mucous membrane of the collapsed bladder, and so may escape contact with the sound. All these events are more likely to happen in children than in the adult, and it is in them that, for want of attention to these pre- cautions, the unfortunate accident of cutting into the bladder and finding no stone has most frequently occuiTed. 2. Difficulty in Entering the Bladder.—This is rarely experienced in adults. It may, however, arise in consequence of the Surgeon neglecting to keep the point of the knife well lodged in the groove of the staff, and thus letting it slip between the rectum and the bladder ; the tissue of which, being broken up, leaves a kind of cavity that he mistakes for the interior of the bladder. If the perinceum be very deep and the prostate enlarged, he may also experience some difficulty in reaching the bladder ; but he can scarcely fail to do so if he push the knife Avell on in the groove of the staff, and dilate the incision in the prostate with a blunt gorget, if his finger fail to reach the cavity beyond it. Perhaps the most serious obstacle to en- tering the bladder consists in the presence of large tumours in the prostate. The com- bination of a deep perinEeum, an enlarged prostate, and a tumour, certainly constitutes a formidable series of obstacles. In these cases, the finger when slipped along the staff does not enter the bladder, but be- comes involved in the smooth and irregular sinuosities that wind between the prostatic tumours (Fig. 751). In such cases it is nrell to practise the manoeuvre that has already been described ; viz., of using the staff as a guide into the bladder, slipping the forceps along the side and con- cavity of this instrument before it is withdrawn. In lays, gi-eafc and sometimes insuperable difficulty has been experienced Fig. 751.—Tumour of I’roatate, uaUnid size, removed during Litliotomy from 11 man aged (34.URINARY CALCULUS. 7S2 m reaching the bladder. This difficulty arises in consequence of the small size of the urethra, the mobility of the bladder, and the ready lacerability of the tissues. If, after the gToove in the staff has been exposed, care be not taken to insinuate, as it Avere, the nail into the opening in the urethra thus made, the membranous portion may be torn across ; and the neck of the bladder, receding befoi’e the finger, may easily be pushed away from the sur- face, so that the Surgeon may fail in reaching the cavity of the organ. When the road is once lost in this wajy, there is the very greatest difficulty in finding it again. The course that should be pursued is, I think, as follows. If the staff haA c not been AvithdraAvn, the Siu’geon must again place the knife in its groove, and carefully push it on towards the neck of the bladder, notching that structure and passing the finger cautiously along the groove, and hooking doAvn the parts with his nail until he reach the inside of the bladder. Should the staff haA’G been withdraAAm, the Surgeon must endeavour to pass it again ; if he succeed in this, he may act as just stated ; but if he cannot succeed in introducing the staff fairly into the bladder, he must on no account tvluiiever endeaAmur to open that viscus, or continue his attempts at the extraction of the calculus, but must at once abandon the operation until the parts have healed, Avhen he can repeat it. The great danger in these cases arises fi’om the Surgeon losing his presence of mind, and endeavouring to enter the bladder Avithout a guide a procedure which must be unsuccessful, and can only end in the destruction of the patient. In adults, the difficulty is to get out the stone ; in children, to get into the bladder. 3. Difficulty in Seizing and. Extracting the Stone is far more fre- quently met Avith than in reaching the bladder. This may be OAAdng to a variety of causes. It is likely to happen in all those cases in AA’hich, either fr’om the depth at Avhich the bladder lies from the sm’face, or fr’om the pecuhai’ position of the calculus, the stone cannot be felt Avith the finger after the incisions have been made into the neck of the bladder. Difficulty from the Position of the Stone.—The calculus may be lodged in the lo wer fundus. This is especially apt to happen if the patient be old and fat, and haAm a deep perinmum, perhaps vrith enlarged prostate, behind which the stone may be lodged. This constitutes the greatest difficulty. Here the best plan is to use a much-curved pair of forceps, and to tilt the bladder up by introducing the finger into the rectum, so as to bring the stone within reach. HTien the stone is situated in the upper fundus of the bladder above the pubes, it is altogether out of the axis of the incision, and in such a case can only be extracted with great difficulty. Aston Key recommends that in such cases the abdomen should be compressed, and the calculus thus pushed doAvn into reach. This suggestion is a very useful one ; and it Avas only by employ- ing this manoeuvre and using a very curved scoop, that I could remove a calculus lodged above the pubes, in the first patient AA'honi I cut at the Hospital many years ago. Difficidty in consequence of the Stone heing Fixed to or retained in the Bladder. ■—A small calculus may be enveloped hij the folds of the imicous memhrane, and in this Avay elude the grasp of the forceps. In these circumstances there is nothing for the Surgeon to do, but patiently to try to disentangle and removeENCYSTED CALCULUS. 783 the calculus by means of the finder and scoop, if it can be so reached ; if not, by expanding the forceps in the bladder, to try to push aside the mucous membrane that surrounds the stone. In consequence of spasm of the 'bladder, it is said to have occasionally happened that a calculus has been so firmly fixed as not to admit of the application of the forceps, the blades of which could not be introduced between the walls of the viscus without using an improper degree of force, and giving rise to the danger of rupturing the neck of the bladder. I am disposed to think that this “ spasm of the bladder ” is purely imaginary, and that the real difficulty has arisen from some other, cause, as perhaps a contracted and rickety peh'is. But, whatever may be the real cause of a difficulty that has un- doubtedly been encountered, I think it Avould be safer for the Surgeon to" desist from the operation, and in the course of a few days or weeks endeavour to complete the extraction, and thus perform the operation a deux temps ” of Deschamps. The stone may be so fixed between liypertrophied fasciculi in the interior of the bladder, as to be detached with considerable difficulty. In such cases, the scoop Avill be found to be the most useful instrument for its removal. "When the calculus is encysted, its extraction will probably be impracticable, or attended with most dangerous consequences. Hence, it is expedient not to operate in cases of encysted calculus that are known to be such. If, hoAvever, the Surgeon have been unfortunate enough to cut into a bladder containing an •encysted calculus, he must be guided in the course he should adopt by the eondition in which he finds the stone. If the aperture leading into the cyst be very small, as in Fig. 723, the better plan A\dll be to j>roceed no further with the operation, as it Avill be clearly impossible to remove the stone. If, on the other hand, the aperture into the cyst be large, he might feel disposed to make an effort to extract the calculus. With this view he mio-ht adnnf. f.bp on the eighth day after the operation.URINARY GALCULUS. 784 Amyloid Tumours in the Prostate constitute sometimes rather a serious diffi- | culty in lithotomy. They may do this in two ways ; first, by elongating the ' prostatic part of the urethra to so groat an extent as to caiTy the neck of the bladder far from the surface ; and, secondly, by being in the way during ex- traction of the stone. A tumour of this kind, an inch or more in diamotei', necessarily fills up to a very serious extent the space in the wound through which the stone has to pass ; it jams up the orifice and prevents the free play of the forceps. These tumours, however, when caught between the blades or shanks of the forceps, soon shell out, and, rolling out of the wound, allow the easy exit of the calculus after them (Fig. 751). Richets of the Pelvic Bones may constitute a serious or even an insuperable obstacle to the extraction of a calculus. This condition may act in two ways. It may narrow the brim of the pelvis in its antero-posteriox^ diameter, to so gi-eat an extent as to prevent the passage of the stone downwards after it has been seized by the forceps. This condition is more to be feared in children, in whom the bladder, being an abdominal organ and lying high, is altogether above the brim of the pelvis in these cases. Or there may be difficulty in the extraction of the stone through the inferior outlet, owing to the approximation of the rami on each side. The first cause of difficulty once ocemred to me, in operating on a very rickety boy four years and a half old. Of the second I have had no experience. The rickety condition of the pelvis may be suspected in cases in which the lower limbs are much distorted. Its existence may he ascertained by digital exploration of the rectum, and by external measure- ments. If it be found to exist to an extreme degree, it would probably be safer to perform the suprapubic operation. Difficulty deinndiny icpon the Shape and Size of the Stone.-—If the stone be very round, it is usnally more difficult to seize than when flat or elon- gated. Flat, disc-shaped calculi, however, occasionally fall into the fundus of the bladder behind the prostate, and then cannot be readily reached by the forceps, which passes over them. In these circumstances, they are best ex- tracted by the curved scoop. Very flat broad calculi, and those that are round, egg-shaped, or branched, are the most difficult to remove, even though their size be not very great. As a general rule, however, it may be stated that, the larger the calculus, the more difficult is its extraction. This arises not so mixch from the outlet of the pelvis being too naiTow, as from the irecessity of making the internal incisions through the prostate to a very limited extent. There will always be considerable difficulty experienced in extracting calculi weighing six or eight ounces and upwards; though cases are recorded by Cheselden, Klein, and others, in which calculi from twelve to fifteen ounces in weight have been extracted by the lateral operation. Any calcidus above one inch and a half in its shorter diameter will present con- siderable difficulties in being extracted through an incision in the prostate of the ordinary size ; viz., not exceeding eight lines in length, even though this , be considerably dilated by the pressure of the fingers ; and I think it may be safely said, that a calculus two inches and upwards in diameter can scarcely be removed by the ordinary lateral operation with any degree of force whicli it is safe to employ. The practice adopted in such a case, more than a century ago, by Gooch, of Norwich, is probably the best that can be pm-sued. It con-2IANAGEMENT OF LARGE CALCULUS. 785 sists in drawing- the stone well down with the forceps, and then letting an assistant carefully divide the tissues that resist. In this way, by a process of traction, twisting, and division, the stone may be brought out u-itli safety. In the facility with which the calculus is extracted, however, much wll depend upon the make of the forceps. As Liston most truly observes, “ There can be no more fotal error than to attempt the extraction of a large stone with short and shabby forceps.” In these cases the open-bladed forceps (Fig. 731) will be found useful, the absence of metal in the most convex part of the blade lessening materially the bulk of the instrument when grasping a stone. In the event of the calculus being too large to be extracted by the ordinary lateral operation, what course should the Surgeon pimsue ? Three are open to him : 1. Division of the Right Side of the Prostate from the interior of the wound ; 2. Crushing the Calculus in the Bladder, and then remov ing it; and 3. The performance of the Recto-vesical Operation. The Incision of the Right Side of the Prostate gives considerable additional space, and is sufficient for most ordinary purposes; very large calculi being fortimately seldom met with. This section may be made by introducing into the wound a probe-pointed scalpel (Fig. 730), guided by the index-finger, and very cautiously dividing the right side of the prostate downwards and outwards, in the same direction that the section of the left has been made. This procedure must be ■cautiously done. The parts, being put well on the stretch as the stone is drawn forwards, are carefully notched, and thus yield to the traction. In two cases I have seen Liston do this. In one the patient recovered, in the other he died of diffuse cellular inflamma- tion. I have practised it once on a patient at the Hospital, who made an excellent recovery. 1 he second plan, that of Crushing the Calculus in the Bladder through the wound in the perinsBum, would certainly be a hazardous procedure. The in-ita- tion that vmild necessarily be set up by the large lithotrite or crusher (Mg. /0-) that has been invented for this purpose, by the presence of the _agments of stone, and by the necessary difficulty and delay of clearing em out of the viscus, would probably be fatal to the patient. In the event if wmilriT” extract the calculus through the perinteum, I think /• 0 adopt the third course, and to perform the rcr/o-m/m? oimakon, which will presently be described. Should, however, the unusually large size ^ the stone have been recognised before the commencement of 2 Fig. 752.—Lithotomy Crusher and Drill for large Calculi.UIUNARY CALCULUS. 786 operation, it might be thought more safe to practise at once the high than the lateral operation. Difficulty from Fracture of tlie Calculus.—The difficulty of extraction is greatly increased if the stone be broken. Fractm-e of a calculus is of two kinds. In the one case the stone is simply broken into several fragments, or splinters, so to speak, are detached from it. This accident may happen to hard as well as to soft calculi, and is generally owing to the Surgeon employing too much pressure on the blades of the forceps, fearing that the stone may escape fr’om between them ; or it may arise from the large size of the calculus requiring some foi’ce to be exex’cised in its extraction, when the Surgeon is very apt to compress the forceps as he draws the stone doum. When this accident is found to have occurred, the Siu’geon must remove with small forceps the fragments that have been detached. He should then wash out the bladder by coixious injections of tepid water, and very carefully examine its interior for any loose pieces. It is seldom that any worse consequence results from this occurrence, than delay in the completion of the operation. The second mode of fracture consists in the crumbhng down of the calculus so soon as it is seized by the forceps, into a soft mortary mass ; the stone is not broken into large pieces, but, having natm’aUy little cohesion, disinte- grates into a mass of softish fragments, none of which probably exceed a cheny-stone in size, and Which indeed resemble a wet sabulous aggregation, rather than distinct pieces of calculus. This crumbling down can only ocem- in phosphatic calculi, and is most likely to happen with the triple phosphate. It is in no way the fault of the Sm’geon, but arises from want of cohesion hi the calculus, so that the blades of the forceps bite, as it were, through it. It is an unpleasant accident to occur, as it becomes extremely difficult, if not impossible, to clear away the whole of the soft mortary detritus from the- interior of the bladder, to the lining membrane of which it tenaciously adheres, small masses lying under the folds into which the contracted organ is thrown. As much as possible should be removed by the scoop, and the re- mainder washed away, as far as practicable, by copious injections; with all care, however, some will be left, and may be discharged through the wound some days, or even two or three weeks, after the operation. When this happens, the bladder should be thoroughly washed out every day, or every second day, by warm water injections thrown in through a catheter passed down the urethra and allowed to regm’gitate through the wound ; and this plan must be persevered in so long as any foreign body escapes.^ Shoidd the wound have healed, the detritus must be treated as in lithotrity; and the- bladder must be washed out every second or third day by a large-eyed catheter,, until all is removed. Accidekts during Lithotomy.—The principal accidents that may occiu* during the performance of the lateral operation of lithotomy are Hcemoirhage, Cutting the Bulb ; Missing the Membranous Portion of the Urethra ; Wound ' of the Rectmn ; or Wound of the Posterior Part of the Bladdei. Hgemorrhage dming lithotomy may occur fr’om three som-ces : 1. 1 o Superficial Arteries of the Perinieimi; 2. The Deep Arteries of this region; and, 3. The Prostatic and other Veins. 'When excessive, from ^^tever source it proceeds, it is always a very serious complication ; for, even if it do787 WOUND OF PEIUNEAL ARTERIES. not prove fatal by the induction of syncope, &c., which I ^ rai-ely the case, it is apt to lead to a fatal termination indirectly, and at a later period, by favouring or predisposing to the occui-rcnce of low mflammatoiy diseases, local or constitutional. I believe that patients who lose a large ciuantity of blood at the operation seldom recover. e 1 Hemorrhage from the Division of the Superficial or the Transverse Artery of the Permceum is°seldom very dangerous, though occasionaUy, if these vessels be larger than usual, they may furnish a serious quantity of blood ; m such circumstances their ligature would be required, and might be practised eithei before or after the extraction of the calculus. It is better, if possible, to wait until the completion of the operation, lest the ligatui’e be pulled off duiing the extraction of the stone. 1 ' ^ i. i n j 2. The Division of the Deep Arteries of the perinmum, that of the bulb and the internal pudic, w'Oidd be attended by far more serious, peihaps even by fatal consequences ; as, from the depth at w'hich the vessels aie seated, it would almost be impossible to apply a ligatiu’e to them, unless the patient Avere A*ery thin, and the perinmum proportionately shalloAV. The facility of ligaturing any of these arteries, especially that of the bulb, when wounded, is gi’eatly increased by enlarging the incision upwards. In the event of a hgatiu’e not being applicable, the Sm'geon would have to trust to plugging the wound aroiuid the tube, or to the pressm’e of an assistant s fingers con- tinued for a considerable time. The pressiu’e of the fingers of relays of assistants, kept up for a considerable length of time, is perhaps the sui’est mode of aiTesting the hemorrhage. The pressure must be kept up for many hoiu’s; thus South relates a case in which it Avas maintained for fourteen hours ; and Brodie one in Avhich, after twenty-foirr hours, it succeeded. The assistants should not be changed more frequently than necessary, each keeping up pressiu-e for two or three hours, and removing his fingers as cautiously as possible. It is, doubtless, very rare for these arteries to be wounded Avheu they follow their usual course ; though such accidents have happened in the hands of some of the most skilful lithotomists, such as Home, Bell, Boux, and Desault. It was the opinion of Aston Key that the artery of the bulb was . generally cut durmg lithotomy ; but in this I beheve he was mistaken, so far as its trunk is concenied, though doubtless in many cases the bulb itself may be Avounded, and the mesh of twigs, in w'hich the A'essel terminates, diA'ided ; this, however, would not yield an alarming hmmorrhage. The trunk of the artery of the bulb Avould, hoAvever, be endangered by opening the urethra too high up, and lateralising the knife too early, and might bleed very freely. The internal pudic artery, bound down by a strong fascia and under cover of the ramus of the ischium, runs but little risk unless the knife be lateralised too much, and the incision be carried too far outwards. It is in some of the anomalous distributions of these vessels that the greatest danger Avould be occasioned. The artery of the bulb, the inferior hmmorrhoidal, the dorsal artery of the penis, or the internal pudic, may take such an anomalous course that their division must be inevitable ; and, as the Siu’geon has no possible means of knoAving beforehand Avhether the distribution of the arteries is regular or not, and as his incisions are all planned on the supposition that they are, he is not to blame in the event of a vessel being accidentally divided.788 UrjNARY CALCULUS. ■when it takes an abnormal direction, with which it is impossible to he acquainted until after the accident has occurred. If the incision be commenced too high up, and especially if the upper part of the first incision be made by pushing the knife in too deeply, the corpus cavernosum and its vessels may be wounded. It may be stated as a general rule, that serious hfemon’hage is usually best avoided by making the incisions low ; and indeed, I believe that the great secret of success in the lateral operation of lithotomy consists in making all the deep incisions as low as practicable ; the knife entering the groove of the staff from below upwards, rather than fr'om above downwards. 3. Venous Hcemorrliage may occur from two sources—the superficial or the prostatic veins. It is very seldom that any trouble arises from superficial veins ; but in one case I have seen veiy considerable loss of blood occur from a large vein running transversely to and near the upper angle of the wound, lying almost immediately under the skin, which had been incompletely divided. From the prostatic plexus hsemorrhage is most likely to occur in old people, in whom the veins in this situation are often enlarged—almost hEemorrhoidal. Whether the venous bleeding take place fr’om a superficial or fr'om a deep source, it is very apt to find its way back into the bladder, to mix with the urine, and thus to escape through the tube rather than fr’om the wound itself; or the blood may probably coagulate in the interior of the bladder, distending that organ and producing a feehng of dysm’ia. Should it proceed from a superficial source, it may be necessary, as was done in the case just alluded to, to pass a hgatiu’e under the vessel, and thus arrest it. If it occur from the prostatic veins, the better plan wiU be to plug the wound. This is done by passing long strips of lint, either dry or soaked in a solution of perchloride of iron or of alum, along the side of the tube, which must be left in the wound and kept pervious ; or the lithotomy tube may have a “ petticoat ” of thick muslin tied around it, into which the slips of lint are stuffed. The advantage of this arrangement is, that the whole apparatus may very easily be removed together at the end of forty-eight hours. Haemorrhage frrom any of the above-named sources, but more especially fr’om the deep arteries and veins, may take place into the bladder. When this occurs, the urine that escapes vfiU be seen ^to be deeply mixed with blood, and coagula mil form in the interior of the viscus, which becomes distended and rises above the pubes, with dulness on percussion in the hypogastric region. The patient ■will become pale, faint, and cold. In such circumstances, the coagula must be washed out of the bladder with cold water, the soiuce of In-emorrhage ascertained by an examination of the wound, the farther flow of blood arrested by plugging, the ligature, or the actual cautery, restoratives administered, the pelvis placed high, and the patient keep cool. Wound of the Bulb is not of very nncommon occurrence in lithotomy ; and, I believe, is of no consequence beyond furnishing a small additional quantity of blood. Indeed, the bulb is so situated,_ in many cases overlapping the membranous portion of the urethra, that this can scaicely be openc without wouuding it. , ,, Missing the Urethra altogether, and opening up the bladder through oven altogether beyond the prostate, is an accident that may happen if the Si789 SOUIICES OF DANGER AFTER LITHOTOMY. rreon miscalcalato the depth of the perina3um, and, keeping the incisions too Tow, thrust the knife too deeply. It is, I believe, an inevitably fatal accident, as in it the base of the bladder and the recto-vesical fascia are opened, and the patient is thus exposed to the occiuTence of diffuse inflammation of, and infiltration into, the pelvic fosciin. I was present many years ago at the ]wst mortem examination of a fatal case of lithotomy, in which perhaps the most skilful operator of that day had opened the bladder beyond the prostate, leavin" the urethra untouched ; the patient died from the cause just stated. Wound of the Rectum occiu'S more frequently than is generally supposed. It may happen either in consequence of the staff being too much depressed, the edge of the knife turned too directly downwards, or to the rectum being- distended and overlapping the sides of the prostate. I have also known the lower part of the rectum perforated by the Surgeon’s finger, whilst depressing the gut so as to keep it out of the way of the knife. The Treatment of this aecident will vary according to the size and situation of the aperture. If it be of but moderate extent and low down, just above the anus, it wiU probably close as the wound granulates and the lu'ine resumes its passage through the urethi-a. If the incision be more extensive and higher up, the patient will incm- the risk of the miserable infirmity of recto-vesical fistula being induced. In such circumstances, the proper treatment is to divide the sphincter ani from the opening downwards, and thus to lay the gut and wound into one cavity which -nfill j)robably fiU by gTanulation, and thus close the m-inary passages. Wound of the Posterior Part of the Bladder is very rare ; yet it has happened in consequence of the knife being thrust too deej)ly along the groove of the staff, more particularly in operations on children, and would be specially apt to happen in such cases if the bladder did not contain suffi- cient urine at the time. This is an additional reason for injecting the bladder before operating. In children, the lateral operation of lithotomy presents certain special diffi- culties which have already been adverted to. These are : 1, the Surgeon missing the bladder and opening up the recto-vesical space (p. 780); 2, not opening the urethi-a and neck of the bladder sufficiently with the knife, but pushing these parts before the finger, and so tearing across the m-ethra, and thus necessarily being unable to complete the operation (p. 782) ; and 3, i-unning the knife too far along* the groove of the staff into the bladder, and thus wounding the posterior part of that organ. Sources of Danger and Causes of Death after Lithotomy. Litho- tomy, even in healthy subjects, is always a dangerous operation ; and, thouo-h the operator, more is, I believe, due to the constitution and age of the patient and especially to the state of his kidneys. Sir B. Brodie most justly says’ “ Success mhthotomy most undoubtedly depends in a great degi-ee on the mOTinnl olr-ill i-v-P C< T ■-i ^ . _ . _ ^ ® the rate of mortality doubtless depends greatly upon the dexterity and skill*of frirt .!^TT _T_ i it ... . _ ' •' manual skill of the Siu-geon, and on the mode in which the operation is per- formed ; but It depends still more on the condition of the patient with respect790 UlUNARY CALCULUS. bits of catheter, &c., from this organ, bad consequenees have rarely occurred, though the operations liavc often been tedious. In litliotoiny the case is different; for here the bladder is not only usually in a state of chronic irritation, but the kidneys arc frequently diseased, and these conditions influence the result of the operation more materially than any other circum- stances. Hence an operator may have a run of unsuccessful cases ; or, by a fortunate conciuTence of favourable cases, more particularly in childi-en, it has occasionally happened that a Surgeon has cut 20 or 30 patients in succession udthout losing a single one ; but several deaths then occun-ing, though the operation was performed in the same way and with the same care as before, his average has fallen to about the usual level. Green, at St. Thomas’s, cut 40 patients in succession, and only lost one. Tiynn cut 25 patients for stone without losing one, and he said that he thought he had at last discovered the secret of performing lithotomy with success ; but, he added, the Almighty punished him for his presumption, for he lost the next 4 cases that he cut. Bransby Cooper, of Guy’s, cut 30 patients in succession without a death, but then lost several, thus reducing the rate of mortality to the usual standard. Tn’ston, during a period of six years, in which he operated 24 times, lost no patient from lithotomy at University College Hospital; but out of the whole 37 cases which he cut during the period of his connection Avith that insti- tution, there were 5 deaths ; reducing the average to 1 in 7'2. This success Avas, however, very gi’eat when it is taken into consideration that most of these cases occuiTed in adults, and that many of them were of a very serious character. I And on reference to the Hospital Records, that only seven of the patients were under 10 years of age, whilst 14 were above 50 ; of these, two were 80 years of age, of whom 1 died and the other recovered. I beheve that Liston lost only one patient under GO years of age, and that was a lad of 18, in whom he found it necessary to diAude the right side of the prostate as well as the left, and who died of infiltration of urine. Thirty-eight patients, successively operated on at the NorAAoch Hospital, recovered, but the aA'erage rate of mortality in that Institution, calculated from 871 cases, has been 1 in 7*50. The accompanying Table gUes much valuable information on the rate of mortality after lateral lithotomy at different ages. It may be taken as a fair example of successful English practice in this operation.

Sir B. Brodie states, that ot the 50 cases operated on in all the London Hospitals in the year 1854, 10 died; makino- the mortality as nearly as possible 1 in G. But the more recent and extended statistics collected by Thompson, show that the average mortality in the London Hospitals is 1 in 1\. According to Coulson the average mortality in Eno-land, deduced from 1743 cases of the lateral operation, is 1 in G'03 cases; whilsUn France it is 1 in 5'7 ; and for Europe generally 1 in 5’14. The more recent statistics of Sir H. Thompson show a more favom-able result for lateral lithotomy in England. He finds that out of 1827 recorded cases there were 220 deaths, or nearly as possible 1 in 8. Klein states that, of 448G cases of lateral lithotomy, in Moscow, there were 552 deaths ; the mortality thus being nearly the same as in England. The pcr-centage of deaths after lithotomy in the adult will doubtless be foimd gi-adually to increase with the increasing use of lithotrity. This must not be refeiTed to any defect in the method, or to want of skill in the performance of lithotomy, but to the fact that, instead of, as heretofore, being the general method of removing calculus, it has now become the exceptional one. Almost all cases of small and moderate sized calculi in men vdth other- wise healthy urinary organs are now subjected to lithotrity, whilst those cases in which the stone is too large, or the kidneys, bladder, prostate, or lu-ethra too diseased, to admit of this mode of operating, are reserved for lithotomy ; and as the mortality after this operation increases in the exact proportion to the size of the stone and the disease in the urinaxy organs, we must expect that, when its performance is confined to persons with large calcuh, irritable bladders, enlarged prostates, diseased kidneys, or strictured urethrm, a higher per-centage of deaths vill follow it than was the case when all favourable cases, and not the unfavourable ones only, Avere subjected to it. Age exercises a more marked influence on the result of lithotomy than any other condition. Lithotomy may be looked upon as one of the most successful operations in surgery at early periods of life, a hazardous one in middle age, and an extremely dangerous one in advanced age. At the Korwich Hospital, lithotomy has been found to be foiu’ times as fatal in men as in boys. Coulson finds, on analysing 2972 cases of lithotomy, that the mortality at •each successive decennial period is as follows. Below 10 years it is 1 in 13, and thence gradually augments from 10 to 80 years to 1 in 9,1 in G, 1 in 5, 1 in 4, 1 in 3’G5, 1 in 3‘23, and 1 in 2'71. I he reason of the small mortality after lithotomy in boys, as compai'ed ■with adults, is twofold. In the first place, the urinary oi’gans, more especially •the kidneys, are healthier than in the adult ; and secondly, the urine is less .acrid, less irxitating, less loaded Avith effete mateiials of an unhealthy charactei’, .and is consequently less apt to excite inflammation in those tissues over Avhicli it filtrates in its passage through the Avound. Hence, Avhen boys die after lithotomy, they do not usually perish from the same causes that prove fatal in the adult, viz., kidney-disease and diffuse pelvic inflammation and infilti’ation; but the fatal result is gcixerally the conse- •quence of some accident having occuiTcd or violence been inflicted diu’ino'UlUNAEY CALCULUS. 792 the operation, such as l)y mistaking the recto-vesical space for the interior of the bladder, the tearing across of the urethra and non-extraction of the stone, -wounding of the recto-vesical fold of peritoneum, or perforation of the back of the bladder by the point of the scalpel. It is by these accidents usually that death happens in boys that arc cut for stone, and not from unavoidable circumstances that may follow the most skihully performed operation. The Shock of the Operation occasionally proves fatal, though probably much less frequently since the introduction of chloroform than was formerly the case. Yet, even now, patients occasionally die from this cause, induced either by a very much prolonged operation, or by the system being weakened, and having lost its resisting power in consequence of disease of the kidneys, perhaps of a latent character. The State of the Kidneys influences the result of lithotomy in the adult more directly than any other condition. If these organs be sound, the patient win usually recover ; hence in children, in whom the complication of renal disease rarely exists, lithotomy is very successful, even though the operation is proportionately far more severe in them than in adults. If, on the other hand, the kidneys be extensively and chronically diseased, the patient will commonly die, even though he have been operated upon with the utmost care and skill. The condition of the kidneys that is especially fatal has been fully de- sciibed in Chapter LXVII. This morbid condition may be evidenced by the presence of albumen in considerable quantities in the urine, and granulai* casts, with muco-pus. If the albumen, in subsiding to the bottom of a test- tube, after being coagulated by heat and acid, form a precipitate that does not amount to more than one-tenth of the bulk of the mine, the case may, I think, be looked upon as tolerably favourable ; but, if it amount to one-sixth, the case is decidedly unfavomable, though even under these circumstances I have often seen recoveiy take place. Yet, with kidney-disease that -will fmnish such a quantity of albumen as this, the patient vdU be very liable to the occurrence of low and diffuse cellular inflammation. A Prolonged Operation, even under antesthetics, is dangerous; and, although it is certainly not well to operate against time, yet it is undoubtedly advantageous to flnish the operation ■v^dth as little delay as is consistent -with the safety of the patient, even though he be an'sesthetised. Hemorrhage does not so often prove fatal, either shortly after the opera- tion, or at a later period, as might be expected from the great vascidarity of the parts incised. Secondary hEemon'hage, of a dangerous or even fatal character, may, however, come on six, eight, or ten days after the operation. I have known it as late as the fourteenth day. It must be borne in mind that, when hemorrhage takes place after the operation, the blood may find its -\Wy into the bladder rather than escape externally, distending the viscus with coagula, but not giving any external evidence of the mischief that has occurred. Secondary hemorrhage will usually cease on plugging the womid with sponge or lint soaked in alum solutions. Should it prove serious, hmv- ever, the actual cautery may be advantageously employed. In a case tha occun-ed to me, the bleeding on the ninth day was stopped by wiping out the wound with the actual cautery, a practice which, I have been iiitormoDANGEll OF CUTTING BEYOND PROSTATE. 793 by A. Dalrjmple, -^vas occasionally successfully practised by that excellent litliotomist, his father. Cystitis is, in my experienee, a rare sequence of lithotomy. I ha-^'e, how- ever, seen it occur, attended by the secretion of largo quantities of ^'iscid, ropy mucus from the bladder, coming aAvay two or three days after the operation, with tenderness in the suprapubic region. It may exist before the operation, or may be de'\’cloped by long-continued or rough manipulations with the forceps in searching for the stone, or from the irritation of the tube. The symptoms are apt to simulate those of pelvic peritonitis. The Treatment con- sists of fomentations above the pubes, abundant diluents, and washing out the bladder with tepid water injeeted through the wound. Diffuse Inflammation of the Areolar Tissue of the Pelvis, especially of the layers around the neck of the bladder, between it and the rectum, and that extend from thence under the peritoneum, is the most frequent cause of death after lithotomy. This inflammation, which is always diffuse or erysipela- tous, followed by rapid sloughing of the textures that it invades, may arise from two causes : 1. From the urine being infiltrated into the areolar tissue, in consequenee of the iucision extending beyond the limits of the prostate, into the loose layers of tissue that he behind the recto-vesical fascia and around the bladder; 2. In consequence of the hruising and laceration to which the neck of the bladder, the prostate, and the textures between it and the rectum, are subjected, in prolonged attempts to extract a large calculus through too small an incision. 1. The danger of Cutting legond the Limits of the Prostate in the adult has already been adverted to. In the extraction of calculi of ordinary size, there can be no necessity to extend the internal incision ; but when the calculus is of considerable magnitude, the Sui’geon, wishiug to get as much space as possible, may inadvertently cany his knife beyond the prostate ; or, if he make a out into the right side of this gland, he may perhaps prolong it a little too far, and thus open the loose areolar tissue or fascia which lies beyond it, and which is continuous Avith the pelvic and subperitoneal planes of areolar merubrane. By dilating the incision in the prostate downwards and outwards, either with the Anger or with a blunt gorget, injmy to this tissue is prevented. If the ineision extend beyond the prostate, the urine, as it escapes through the Avound, soaks into the meshes of the loose areolar tissue over which it floAAS, and thus gives rise to infiltration, foUoAved by rapidly extending inflam- mation and sloughing, which speedily involve the Avhole of the neighbourino- texflures. This misehief generally occurs within the first forty-eight hours" indeed I have never seen it come on after the third day. It is indicated by the patient being seized with rigors, followed by dry heat of skin, a quick pulse, Avhich, after a time, may become intermittent, and a diy and broAAn imvoT' f f ® complain of some tenderness about the Ibp bn^ a^.t^omen, and in tlie gi-oins ; the beUy becomes tympanitic, the body covered Avith a profuse sweat; hiccup comes on, the pulse becomes more Aveak and fluttenng, and death usually occurs about the fourth or fifth y aftei the operation. In some cases, there are more decided sio-us of peiitoiieal inflammation; but, as Brodie very truly remarks, this is not theURINARY CALCULUS. 794 primary disease, but is only induced secondarily Ly the inflammation and sloughing of the areolar tissue of the pelvis spreading to the contiguous serous membrane. The Trealment of such cases must be conducted on the ordinary principles that guide us in the management of diffuse inflammations. It is only by ad- ministering ammonia, with such a quantity of wine or brandy as the state of the system may indicate, together with such nourishment as the patient can take, that life can be preser^'cd. The disease is a depressing one, and requires a stimulating plan of treatment. Brodie has recommended that in these cases a free incision should be made throirgh the sloughy tissues about the wound into the rectum, in accordance with the general principles that guide us in the management of similar affections elsewhere. In one case of that kind that occim-ed under his care, he saved the patient by passing a curved probe-pointed bistoury into the wound to its furthest extremity, to the left side of the neck of the bladder; he then pushed it through the tunics of the rectum, and, draw- ing it downwards, divided the lower part of the gut together Avith the sphincter ; thus laying the wound and the rectiun into one. The relief was im- mediate, and the patient recovered. This plan of treatment certainly seems rational, and worthy of trial in similar cases. 2. Diffuse inflammation of the areolar tissue around the neck of the bladder and prostate arising from Bruising and Over-distension of the parts dining the extraction of a large calculus is, I believe, a more frequent occurrence than infiltration of urine, and fully as fatal. This sequence of lithotomy is especially npt to occm’ in those cases in which, in consequence of diseased kidneys, or the existence of other organic mischief, the patient is more than usually liable to the supervention of diffuse or erysipelatous inflammation ; indeed, it is in this indirect way, I believe, that diseased kidneys constitute such a formidable •obstacle to the safe performance of lithotomy. In the extraction of large calculi, considerable traction is required, and force must be exerted; hence undue bruising and laceration are very apt to be inflicted upon the parts that constitute the line of incision. It is in this way that the danger of lithotomy increases almost in exact proportion to the size ■of the calculus : for here the Sm-geon is often placed betiveen the horns of a dilemma. He must either cut beyond the limits of the prostate, and thus incur the risk of inducing urinary infiltration into, or diffuse inflammation of, the pelvic fascirn : or else, by hmiting his incision to the margin of the gland, .and thus having, perhaps, an aperture of insufficient size, he may inflict severe injury by the bruising and laceration of parts during forcible and possibly prolonged efforts at extraction. It must, howei'er, be borne in mind that, the lai’ger the stone, the more probabihty is there of the existence of old-standing disease of the bladder or kidneys, and of an unfai'ourable result from this •cause. Crosse has draivn up a table that shows A'ery strikingly the influence of the weight or, in other w'ords, of the size of a calculus on the results of lithotomy. He found that when the stone was one ounce and under in weight, the deaths were in the proportion of 1 in 11-25 cases. 'WTien it was fr-om 1 to 2 ounces in iveight, there ivas 1 death in G-Gl cases: when from 2 to 3 ounces, 1 death in 2-18 cases : Avhen from 3 to 4 ounces, 1 death in D57 cases : ivhen from 4 to 5 ounces, 1 death in TGG cases. This table, which has been con-MEDIAN LITHOTOMY. 795 structccl on the results of 703 cases, illustrates very clearly these facts, that the operation for the removal of a large calculus is far more dangerous than that for the extraction of a small one, and that the danger increases in the direct ratio of the size of the stone. The symptoms of diffuse inflammation of the areolar tissue arising from this cause very closely resemble those from infiltration of urine, and the •treatment must be conducted on precisely similar principles. Peritonitis may occim after lithotomy, as a consequence of the extension of inflammation from the bladder or the pelvic fascim to the serous membrane, from wound of the posterior part of the bladder, or from extension of inflam- mation from a sacculus of the bladder to its immediate investment of peritoneum. To one or other of these conditions, more especially inflammation of the pelvic fascim, it will always be found to be secondary. Sloughing.—In persons of a feeble and cachectic habit, especially in those who are the subjects of phosphatic calculi, the wound vdll often assume a sloughy condition, and heal slowly, or its surface may become coated by phos- phates. In such cases a liberal allowance of stimulants voll be required, together with the local ap25hcation of compound tinctme of benzoin ; and, in order to facilitate contraction at a more remote period, a solution of nitrate of sih'er, or the tinctme of cantharides. The phosphates may be removed by injection of the dilute nitric acid lotion. Having finished the consideration of the ordinary lateral operation, we shall now proceed to that of other methods for extracting the stone by cutting pro- •cedm'es. These are the Median, the Bilateral, the Medio-lateral, and the Biipraimlic operations ; each of which has its advocates, to the exclusion of the others, and each of which undoubtedly possesses certain special advan- tages. In addition to these, there are various modifications of these different •operations which the ingenuity of Surgeons has deAused, but which have usually little to recommend them in the opinions of any except of theh •originators. iVlEDiAif Lithotomy. The median operation of lithotomy is that procedure by which a stone is extracted through an incision in the raphe of the perinmum, oxtending into the urethra behind the bulb. Histm y. The history of the median operation affords an illustration of the mutability of professional practice, and makes it appear as if there w^ere a cycle of opinion in surgery, as in fashion, politics, and philosophy. The median opeiation was introduced three or four hmidred years ago, and continued to be practised up to the middle of the last century, when its tediousness, its painful character, and the excessive mortality foUowing it, caused it to faU into disuse as soon as the safer and simpler method of Cheselden was introduced. Of late years, however, it has been revived under a somewhat modified form ; and it IS t IS modem median operation, and its supposed advantages over the lateral, that we must here consider. The old median operation—called also the “ Marian,” fr-om Sanctus Ma- iManus, who AVTote on it, though it did not originate Avith him, and the opeiation of the apparatus major,” fr-om the number of instruments used in I was performed in the following manner, according to John Bell A grooved staff Avas introduced into the bladder, and the patient tied up in the796 URINARY GALCULUS. usual way ; the lithotomist thcu, kneeling or sitting before him, made an incision in the perinmum, not exactly in the raphe, which was thought to be dangerous, but A-ery slightly to the left side, and terminating just above the anus. The knife Avas then carried on to the membranous part of the methi-a, Avhich Avas opened on the groove of the staff; and, the knife being kept firmly pressed against the staff; a long probe was introduced into the bladder by its side. The knife and the staff Averc now Avithdi-awn, nothing but the probe being left in the bladder, to serve as a guide into this cavity. Along this probe, two iron rods, called “ conductors,” Averc noAV passed, and Avith these the operator dilated the prostate and neck of the bladder, by separating the handles—at least, it was said that he dilated them, but, as John Bell pithily observes, “ he dilated, or, in plain language, tore open, the prostate gland.” These conductors being held aside, “ dilators ” Avere introduced so as to enlarge the opening, the forceps was then pushed into the bladder, and the stone extracted as it best could be. The principles of this operation Avere—a hmited incision in the membranous part of the lU’ethra above the anus ; dilatation, and not incision, of the prostate and neck of the bladder ; or, to use the words of Le Cat, “ small incision ; much dilatation.” Its results were, hoAvever, so unsuccessful, that it fell into entire disuse here, and almost so on the continent, merely appearing from time to time under various modifications at one or other of the continental schools. This condition of things prevailed mitil about twenty years ago, when a new form of median operation was devised by Allarton, who with gveat perseverance and equal ability urged it upon the attention of Surgeons in this country, by Avhom it has noAv been extensively practised. Operation.—This operation, for the introduction of which into modem sm’gery the greatest credit is due to Allarton, is performed as foUoAvs. A staff,, grooved along its convexity, haAong been inserted into the bladder, the patient is tied up in the usual mamier ; the Surgeon then, sitting in front, introduces his left index finger into the rectum, and feels for the apex of the prostate, against AAkich he keeps it lodged, in order to judge of the distance of the pros- tate from the siu’face, to act as a guide to the knife, and prevent the rectum fr’om being Avoimded. A straight-backed bistoury is now entered half an inch above the anal aperture, and pushed straight forwards, to a depth of about an inch and a half in the mesial line, so as to enter, if possible, the gvoove of the staff at the apex of the prostate. A small incision upwards is then made in the groove of the staff, and, as the knife is AvithdraAvn, the incision in the skin is also extended upwards; the knife is then laid aside, and a long ball-pointed probe is introduced into the bladder along the groove of the staff, which is then withdraAAui. The probe is now the only guide to the bladder’; and up to this point, therefore, there is but little, if any, difference between the modern median and the old Marian operations, except that the incision is exactly in, instead of a httle to one side of, the middle line. The forefinger is now introduced along the probe, and by Avorking it forwards the prostate is dilated, and^ the finger enters the bladder, Avherr, the probe being removed, the forceps is introdrreed, and the stone extracted. Thus it Avill be .seen that the orrly real point of difference betAveen this and the old Marian operation, is that irr the mo ernMODIFICATION' OF MEDIAN OPERATION. 797 The first, which I think of some staff, a rectangular one gi-oovcd from about one inch above the elbow nearly to the point, re- sembling the staff introduced by Buchanan of Glasgow (Fig. 753). Its use and advantages are that, when in the bladder, the angle rests against the apex of the prostate, and can be felt in the perinosum, and the Sm-geon can judge of the exact point where to enter the knife (directing it so as to open the groove just below the Fig- 753,-Median operation with Rectangular Staff, angle), which he cannot do with the curved staff; the incision upwards also is limited, and there is, besides, less danger of wounding the rectum, the urethra being drawn upwards away from it, and not pushed down against it, as with the ordinary staff. The knife should be straight-backed, having the back not more than two inches long ; so that the Surgeon can tell to what depth he has entered it. I have found it advantageous in practice to carry a beaked director, shaped like a large hernia-director, along the groove, after the incision has been made in the urethra, so as to open up the canal and thus to clear the passage for the finger. And haAfing opened the urethra, I think it better to dilate the prostate before withdrawing the staff; by pushing the finger slowly, with a rotatory movement, along its side, the bladder is entered Avith more ease and certainty ; whereas, if only the probe be used, it may not be stiff enough, and the Surgeon is apt to push the bladder before him. It has been proposed to employ mechanical means of dilatation, instead of the finger, to open up the prostate and neck of the bladder ; and I have had some dilators for this purpose constructed by Coxeter on the principle of the two-bladed dilator of the female urethra. I have tried them on the dead subject ; but I have not ven- tured to use them on the living, lest, by the employment of screAv-power, the same deep lacerations of the neck of the bladder should result that were so fatal in the old Marian operation. Indeed, I believe that their use AA'ould, be fraught AA’ith danger from their liability to occasion rupture of the neck of the bladder ; and, if persisted in, I cannot but fear that they Avill bring discredit on the operation, reducing it to the condition of an old Marian, and repeating the dangers of that procedure. No safe dilatation can be effected except by the finger, with Avhich no harm can be done, whilst it appears to me that the greatest possible mischief may be done Avith scrcAV-dilators. COAIPAllISOX BETAVEBN THE MEDIAN AND THE LATERAL OPERATIONS.—The tAVO operations, the lateral and the median, cannot Avith propriety be comparedURINARY CALCULUS. 79S as a whole, as wo have as yet no sufficient statistics to enable us to determine- whether the mortality after the median has been less than that which has fol- lowed the lateral. AYc may, hoAvever, compare the modern median operation with the lateral, and endoaTOur to determine in what respects the median is superior, in what inferior, to the lateral, and in what cases it might be em- ployed instead of the latter. For in this, as in lithotrity, the Surgeon should not be too exclusive ; it is his duty to learn and to practise different methods of attaining the same end, and to make use of one or the other according to the- requirements of the actual case before him, and to endeavour to select what is good and to reject what is doubtful in every method brought before him. It would be in the highest degree unsurgical to lithotrise only, or to cut only, every patient with stone coming under care ; and I believe that there is a choice as to the cutting operation to be performed. In fact, there are no opera- tions in Siu’gery that require to be so frequently modified, according to the- necessities of the particular case, as those for stone : the age of the patient, the size and number of the calculi, and the condition of the urinary organs, alt exercise A'ery important modifying influences, and prevent the Sm-geon fr’om confining himself to one method exclusively. In order to make a proper comparison between these two operations—the median and the lateral—we must take them seriatim. The difficulties and dangers of the lateral operation are : 1, the difficulty in some cases of entering- the bladder; 2, hmmoiThage ; 3, the risk of wounding the bulb ; 4, of wound- ing the rectum ; 5, too extensive an incision in the prostate, and opening up- the pelvic fascia ; G, the difficulty in extracting the stone. 1. General Ease and Simplicity of the Operation.—There is no doubt that the Siu’geon wiU be more skilful in that operation which he has more often- performed : so far as ease and simplicity are concerned, there is no gi-eat difference between them. In the lateral operation there is very seldom any difficulty in entering the bladder, though Surgeons have sometimes been foiled in this; but Surgeons of the gi’eatest skill have also had great difficulty in entering the- bladder in the median operation. The bladder tends to be pushed upwards and backwards before the finger, especially in boys, in whom the prostate is ^ not developed; and, unless the neck of the bladder be well opened, there i appears to be great danger of tearing across the membranous part of the- urethi’a, and of pushing forward the separated bladder. In boys, the parts are- so very small and undeveloped, and the space to work in is so very naiTow, that an ordinary finger can only with great difficulty be got through the neck of the bladder unless this have been freely incised. But, by doing this, we depart- entirely from the guiding principle laid down by the advocates of the median operation, viz., dilatation and not incision. So far as facihty of entering the bladder is concerned, the two operations are probably on a par in the adidt: but in the boy the result of recent experience would show that the difficidties in this respect are far greater in the median than in the lateral; although the- ‘ latter operation even is not exempt from difficulty from this cause. 2. Hjemorrhage.—In this respect, the median operation has decidedly the advantage. If the incision be made in the middle line, without woimdmg the bulb, alSiough there may be tolerably free bleeding at the time, yet there is no- vessel that can furnish dangerous consecutive hemorrhage ; whilst in thelatcraLATERAL LITHOTOMY COMPARED. 799 MEDIAN AND opci-ation there are the dangers of arterial and of profuse the knife coiuino- into close relation with the artery of the bulb and others of some size If the object were, therefore, simply to save blood, the median is so far better than the lateral. But, after all, it must in fairness be said that the daimer of excessivo hemorrhage in the lateral operation is but very sma . "With care, it will rarely happen that the patient loses a dangerous amoun o 3 Wound of the Bulb.—This may occur in both, but is more difficult to avoid, and indeed is very likely to happen, in the median, as the bulb some- times so overlaps the membranous part of the urethra, that it is difficult not to cut it; whilst in the lateral operation, by cutting low down, and entering- the oi-oove of the staff well back, and from below upwards, this may always be avoided. It is true that division of the bulb in the mesial line seldom gives rise to much heemoiThage ; but cases have occurred to my knowledge, though not in my practice, in which patients have died from this cause after the perineal section, the blood regm’gitating into the bladder, and filling^ that viscus. 4. Wound of the Rectum.—This gut is not in much danger in the lateral operation, unless it be distended. In the median, on the other hand, tne rectum is in considerable danger. If this operation be performed on the dead body, it -will be found that the back of the bistomy comes very, I may say imcomfortably, close to the finger in the rectum ; and if another finger be- placed in the woimd, they will come into very close apposition just anterior to the prostate. In the old Marian operation, the rectum used to be very frequently cut, gas and farces issuing from the rvound. 5. Treatment of the Prostate.—As to the difference in this respect—i.e., dilatation in the median, section in the lateral operation—I believe it to be more imaginary than real. I think that it is very nearly the same in both operations when properly performed. All are agreed that in the lateral opera- tion but a limited incision should be made in the prostate and neck of the bladder, these structures being merely notched, and the opening being dilated with the finger, so as to avoid opening up the pelvic fascia. The difference between an incision that opens the capsule of the prostate, and dilating this structm-e by the finger, is very great. The great object in lateral hthotomy is not to open up the pelvic fascia with the knife ; and it is difficult, if not impossible,, to tear this Avith the finger. If we take an aponein'osis out of the body, it will be found to be very difficult to tear ; but if touched ever so lightly with the knife, it separates at once. So, in the median operation, the prostate may be dilated to a considerable extent Avithout opening its capside. I have used the Avord “ dilate ; ” but dilatation appears to me to be an erroneous term. I believe that the prostate is not simply dilated, but partially lacerated : that there is an actual laceration of the substance of the prostate, but not extending into or through its capsule. I have often examined the prostate in the dead subject, after it has been subjected to this process of “ dilatation,” and have ahvays found its substance more or less tom. A laceration of the substance of the prostate, hoAvcA’cr, is of no consequence, and only becomes dangerous Avhen it amounts to rupture of the capsule, when it exposes the patient to the fatal accident of extravasation of urine and diffuse inflammation of the pelvic fascia.UniXARY CALCULUS. 8oo Now, in the lateral operation, in rnnning the kniCe clown the groove of the staff, the Surgeon may readily, unless care be taken, and very often, I iDclievc, docs actually and almost unavoidably go beyond the limits of the prostate, and thus exposes the patient to all these dangers. In the median this cannot be done, if the knife be not used after the urethra is opened, the prostate being dilated solely with tlie finger. So far as this point, then, is concerned, the median may be regarded as safer than the lateral operation, it l^eing im2}ossible to open up the pelvic fasciae with the finger in the median, whilst they mmj be opened by the knife in the lateral. In fact, the neck of the bladder and the prostatic portion of the urethra are in the median operation placed very much in the position of the female urethra when that is dilated for the extraction of a calculus ; being dilated to a gi-eat extent, somewhat lacerated perhaps, but not torn through so as to admit urine into the fasciae of the pelvis ; and in that I believe the gi-eat and essential superiority of the median over the lateral operation to consist. 0. Manipulation of the Forceps and Extraction of the Stone.—In the adult, the main difficulty of lithotomy does not lie in entering the bladder, but in the completion of the operation, that for which the operation has been undertaken—the removal of the stone. And the difficulty and danger increase in proportion to the size of the calcnlus ; the tissues between the neck of the bladder and the perineal integuments must either be widely cut or extensively torn and bruised to allow the passage of a large stone. No amount of simple dilatation of which these tissues are susceptible can make a passage through them that will allow the extraction of a stone 1-| or 2 inches in diameter; such a stone must either be cut or torn out. Now, what space have we in the median operation for the introduction of the forceps and the extraction of a large stone ? Here, I think, is the weak point of the median operation. In it the incision is made, and all the manipulation is practised, towards the apex of the narrow triangle formed by the rami of the pubic bones. The base of this triangle is represented by a horizontal line corresponding to the level of the membranous portion of the m’ethra, and consequently does not occupy the widest part of the perinseum ; it is formed by the lower portion of the deep fascia, supported and filled up by the rectum and the tissues which are attached to and support the gut on each side. These parts form a rigid wall or ban’ier stretching across the periufeum, which cannot be depressed, and requires to be divided laterally into the ischio-rectal fossa before a stone of any considerable magnitude can be removed. It was in consequence of the extensive bruising and laceration of these structures, and the difficulty experienced in bringing the stone through them, that the old Marian operation fell into disuse. / In performing the median operation there are three points, or rather planes, of obstruction, between the siu’face and the interior of the bladder. The first is occasioned by the muscles of the perina3um, and, perhaps, also by the under portion of the deep perineal fascia. In the lateral operation wo cut across this ' plane, and lay open the ischio-rectal fossa, giving abundance of room for the manipulation of the forceps and the extraction ot the stone, along the base of the triangle formed by the rami of the ischiatic and pubic bones. But in the median we have to extract towards the summit of this space, at the apex of a naiTow triangle, having the muscular structures forming a tense bar along itsbe made in the Idadder by it, inovidiicl these advantages are maintained, it is i APrUCABILlTY OF MEDIAN OPERATION. 8oi base, and offering a material obstacle to the introduction of the forceps and the extraction ot the stone. _ 11 i The second obstacle lies in the prostate ; but, as it is easily removable by dilatation, it cannot be considered a serious one. _ The third, the deepest and most important, is situated at the neck ot the bladder. AVe find here a narrow tense ring beyond the prostate ; and this bar remains intact in spite of the dilatation and laceration to which the prostate has been subjected. On introducing the finger, we shall feel it pasped tightly by this rino-. I have found, by experiments on the dead subject, this inner rintr of th^neck of the bladder cannot be expanded to a size more than sufficient to extract a calculus of one inch in diameter without laceration or incision : and its laceration or rupture is well known to be one of the most dangerous and fatal accidents in lithotomy. It is in consequence of the obshicle offered by this, that the median operation is not available for the extraction of large calculi. A calcidus two inches in diameter cannot be extracted by the median operation without the employment of great violence. But, though much force is usually required in order to extract a calculus of even moderate size through this tense ring at the neck of the bladder, it is an undeniable fact that serious consequences seldom follow the violence so used, and that a degree of force, which would be fatal in lateral lithotomy, may be employed without danger in the extraction of a calculus by the median operation. In this respect the extraction of a calculus by the median operation resembles the removal of one through the dilated urethra of the female; the great point in favour of the median over the lateral procedure, and the cause of its com- parative safety, Ijcing that the pelvic fascim are not incised, nor otherwise opened. But, it may be said, what is easier, when the finger is in the bladder, than to push a probe-pointed bistoury along it, and cut downwards and outwards through these structures into the ischio-rectal fossa, if the stone be large, and thus get plenty of space ? Nothing could be easier or more simple ; but what would be the consequence ? AVe at once reduce the median to the conditions of the lateral operation. A free incision in the neck of the bladder and prostate increases the tendency to hasmoiThage, opens up the fascia, and exposes the patient, in fact, to all the dangers of an ill-contrived lateral operation, destroy- ing at once and altogether the principle of the median operation—viz., dilata- tion, and not incision ; and, if we do not gain space by incision, but attempt to extract a moderately large stone by dilatation of the parts, we shall certainly not succeed, but our dilatation will end in a laceration, not only of the substance of the prostate, which is safe, but of the neck and perhaps of the base of the bladder, which will be fatal. Urinary fistula was common after the old Marian operation. It remains to be seen whether it will be so after the modern median. In conclusion, then, it appears to me that the median operation, when per- formed in suitable cases, has the advantages over the lateral of being attended by less risk of arterial haemoiThage, and less danger of injmy to the pelvic fasciaj; but, that in consequence of the very small size of the opening that can only applicable to stones of at most a medium size, and that it cannot in all cases be substituted for lateral lithotomy, as the general operation for stone, where lithotrity is not admissible. TOL. II. 3 p8o2 URINARY CALCULUS. Indications for the Median Operation.—The median operation may with propriety be performed in the following classes of cases. 1. In cases where foreign bodies, such as pieces of bougie, of tobacco-pipe, &c., are lodged in the bladder, the median is preferable, the body being small, elongated, Ld easily extracted. 2. It may be employed to remove stones not exceeding one inch in their smallest diameter. But then, it may be said, calculi of this size can generally be safely subjected to lithotrity. That is true ; but, in certain of these cases, lithotrity is not admissible ; so that the median operation is in- dicated in cases of small calculi in which lithotrity cannot be practised in con- sequence of irritability of the bladder, or of the patient being too weak to bear repeated sittings. If a small calculus be lodged just behind the prostate, in a pouch which occasionally forms at a lower fundus of the bladder, we may come down on it at once by the median incision. 3. When there arc numerous small calculi, lithotrity is not desirable, and then the median operation appears to be preferable. 4. In cases in which lithotrity has been performed, and the patient is unable to expel the fragments, we may perform the median operation, and readily extract the detritus by the scoop, as it lies behind the prostate. 5. In the case also of calculi which are too large to be successfully subjected to lithotrity, but which, if removed by the lateral operation, are attended by a frightful rate of mortahty, it seems to me that the median operation might possibly be advantageously combined with lithotrity. The stone having been broken up at one sitting, the fragments might at once be extracted through a limited incision in the mesial line of the perinteum. 6. In cases in which the patient is so anmmic that the loss of an additional ounce or two of blood might turn the scale against him, median is preferable to lateral lithotomy. For, although it is by no means almost a bloodless operation, as is supposed by some, yet there is less hmmorrhage during the performance, or rather, perhaps, less continuous oozing after its completion, than in the lateral, and there is certainly not the danger of the profuse bleeding that is sometimes seen in that operation. Where we have to do with a stone of large size, the median is not, in my opinion, safe ; such an amount of traction must be used as will infalhbly bruise and lacerate the neck and base of the bladder, and expose the patient to infiltration of urine and deep pelvic inflammation—to all the dangers, in fact, of the old Marian opera- tion ; dangers which were so great that more than half the patients subjected to it perished, and which caused it to be abandoned for the lateral. I have said nothing special about the performance of the median operation in boys. Under the age of puberty, lateral lithotomy is a very successful operation ; certainly the most successful of all the great operations in surgery. The median can scarcely prove to be superior to it in this respect; and unless it can be shovm to possess decided advantages over the lateral in ease of exe- oution—and in this particular respect, in my opinion, it falls far short of the lateral—it does not appear to me to be desirable to abandon an operation ol proved safety for one that is still on its trial. Bilateral Lithotomy.—The bilateral operation introduced by Dupuytren is a modification of the old median. In it a curved transverse incision is made across the perinmum half an inch above the anus, towards which its concavity looks, the horns of the incision extending to two-thirds of the distance between the anus and the tuber ischii on each side (Fig. 754). The dissection is care-bilateral lithotomy. 803 fully earned down to the central point of the perintenm, and the membranous portion of the urethra is opened on a grooved me- dian statf previously intro- duced ; along this the double lithotome cache (Fig. 755) is passed with its concavity turned upwards.

The extraction of the stone is then effected in the usual way. This operation appears to me not to have received the attention from Surgeons in this country that it deserves. By being careful not to open the intestine, and to introduce the lithotome into the membranous portion of the canal, the arteries of the bulb are not endangered, and indeed the transverse and super- ficial arteries of the pcrinaium are also above and beyond the line of incision. The prostate is divided ef|ually on both sides in its greatest diameter ; if the expansion of the lithotome be carefully guarded, there is no danger of going beyond the limits of that organ, or of wounding the internal pudic .arteries (Fig. 757) ; and the interior of the bladder is reached by the most direct and the readiest passage. In withdrawing the litho- tome, the handle must be well depressed, and great care must be taken that the instrument be kept securely in the mesial line, so that the section may not be made more freely in ■one side than the other. The operation has not been performed with sufficient frequency in this country fur • any reliable statistics as to the results. But Eve of Nashville has done it jn 78 cases of all ages, with a mortality of only 8.

Oi-KIIATION,—Civiale has rocominciKled a combinatioi> ot the median and the bilateral operations of lithotomy, by which the chief objections to both are got rid of. This operation is best suited for the extrac- tion of large stones from the bladder ; for those calculi, in fact, which cannot be remo'^’cd by the ordinary median operation without too gi’eat an amount of force, and consequent bruising or laceration of the parts. It is easy of execu- tion, seeins likely to be attended by little risk of htemorrhage, of urinary extravasation, or of pchde inflammation, and opens the Ifladder at the part Avhich is nearest the perineal surface. Ihe operation may be performed in the following manner. The patient ing been tied up, and a deeply grooved rectangular staff passed into the bladder, the urethra is opened at the membranous part with the edge of the knife turned upwards, as described in the median operation (p. 706) ; the double lithotome is then slid along the staff into the bladder, its concavity turned downwards, the blades expanded to but a limited extent, and the prostate, or the bilateral gorget (Fig. 758), invented by Dr. J. Wood, of New York, may be pushed along the staff, and the soft structures between it and the surface incised as it is withdrawn. If the stone be not very large, the incision may be confined to one side only, and made with a probe-pointed bistoury. It will be found that sufficient space is obtained by the perpendicular incision of the skin ; whilst the limited internal transverse cut removes that tension and resistance of the deeper structures,, which in the ordinaiy median operation interfere seriously with the manipulation of the forceps and the extraction of the stone ; and, by the division of both sides of the prostate to a limited extent, abundance of space is obtained. More ex- tended experience has shown, however, that the advantages, are rather theoretical than practical, and that its performance- in this country has been attended by unsatisfactoiy results two of the principal dangers being w'ound of the rectum, and tearing through the sphincter. Many other modifications of the median and the bilateral operations have been practised by varying the direction of the external incision, and by making' the internal one on one or both sides of the prostate, or by notching this- structure in ■\'arious directions. Hif4H OR Suprapubic Opbeatiox.—Although the median and lateral operations for lithotomy are perhaps the safest for the extraction of stones of small or moderate size, yet there can be no doubt that their results are extremely unfavoiuable when the calculus exceeds a certain magnitude ; and in these circumstances it may be deemed expedient to perform the “ high operation ” in preference to them. It is fortunate, however, that large calculi are comparatively rarely met with, and will doubtless become more rare, as the diagnosis of stone can now be made at a very early period of the existence of the calculus, and as the treatment is now generally preventive. Thus, of the 703 Norwich cases, that form the basis of Crosse’s tables, and indeed of our chief information on these points, 520 were mider 1 ounce in weight; 110 Pi^. 758.—Wood'.^ Bilateral Gorget.mail OR SUPRAPUBIC OPERATION. 805 weighed from 1 to i ounces; 85 from 2 to 3 ; 11 irom 8 to 4 ; 5 from 1 to 5) ; and only 4 were above this size. Hence, if we confine the high operation to those instances in which the calculus is above such a size as will readily admit of extractiou through the perinmum, we shall seldom have occasion to perform it; yet instances occasionally occur in which no other method of extracting the caleulus presents itself. Thus, by this method, Uytterhoeven succeeded in ■extracting a calculus, of which he has kindly given me a cast, which measured 1 (]i inches in one circumference, and 12| in the other. It was perfectly moulded to the shape of the inside of the bladder, and clearly could not have ■been removed by any incisions through the pcrinmimi, as the outlet would ■liave been insufficient for its extraction. The patient survived the operation •eight days. But not only may the high operation be recpiired on account of the size of the calculus ; it may be rendered necessary by other conditions, such as the existence of so much rigidity about the hips in consequence of rheumatic disease, as would prevent the proper exposure of the perinmum ; or by that region being the seat of disease which would interfere with any operation being practised through it; or the pelvic outlets may be so contracted b}^ rickets as to prevent the possibihty of the extraction of a stone through them, l)y any of the perineal operations. Operation.—The high operation consists in making an incision through the •abdorm’nal wall, above the pubes, and opening the anterior part of the bladder underneath the reflexion of the peritoneum that passes upwards fi’om its ■superior fundus. In performing this operation, it is necessary that means should be taken to raise up the fundus of the bladder, so that it may project above the pubes, and thus admit of being safely opened. With this view various con- trivances have been invented, such as catheters containing sliding stylets, which can be pushed through the bladder when that viscus is exposed. These instruments, though ingenious, are not necessary ; for the end of an ordinary catheter introduced through the urethra, and made to project above the pubes, will serve as a sufficient guide. The bladder having been slowly but folly injected with tepid water, so that it may arise above the pubes, an incision, about three inches in length, is to be canied from the pubes directly upwards in the mesial line. The pyi’amidales aie then to be cut across near their origin, the linea alba exposed, cautiously opened near the pubes, and divided upwards some httle way. The peri- toneurn must next be pushed back, and the dissection carefully carried through the areolar tissue above the bone, until the instrument previously introduced can be felt through the bladder, when, if it contain a sliding and pointed stylet, this may be pushed through the coats of the bladder : if not. around the margins of the wound. In ■geons kept the bladder empty by making8o6 UEINAMY CALCULU;:<. incisions tliroiigli the pcrinieum into the membranous portion of the urethra or neck of the bladder, thus complicating seriously the operation ; but this accident may best be prevented by introducing a gum elastic catheter into the urethra, and leaving it there for a few days until consolidation has taken place and the wound shows a disposition to close, pressure being at the same time kept up on the lips of the incision. Another cause of danger in this operation is w'ounding the peritoneum,, which may occur in consequence of the contracted state of the bladder causing it to lie low in the pelvis, and thus preventing the proper introduction of instruments to cany it up above the pubes. Dulles finds that the suprapubic is far less favourable than the lateral in its results for calculi below 53'. in weight. For those between 5j. and ^ij., there is little difference, whilst for calculi above 5ij., it is far more favour- aide. He states that, of a gross total of 465 cases of the suprapubic operation, in both sexes there had been 135 deaths, or a mortality of 1 in 3‘44 ; the mortality being about 1 in 3 in males, against 1 in 8’2 iii< females. This high rate of mortahty may to a certain extent be accomited for by the fact that the patients subjected to suprapubic h'thotomy were on an average one-third older, and the stones four and a half times heavier, than in the cases subjected to the lateral operation. Dulles gives a table of 43 cases operated on by American Surgeons, of which 14 died, or as nearly as possible 1 in 3. This agrees with the statistics pre^■iously published by Humphry, who collected 104 cases in which this operation had been performed ; of these 31 proved fatal, chiefly from peritonitis and urinary infiltration—the mortality amounted consequently to 1 in 8^ ; and SouberbieUe, one of the greatest jnodern advocates of this operation, lost 1 patient in 3. The general result, therefore, is not veiy satisfactory ; though, as in many instances the operatioir , was performed in cases in which the lateral method was not applicable on account of the size of the stone, we cannot with justice compare the two pro- cedures in regard to the mortality attending them.LITIIOTEITY. 807 CHAPTER LXIX. 4 URINARY CALCULUS {continmd). LITHOTBITY. Thk operation of Litliotrity, by whicb the stone is crushed in the bladder and the pulverised fragments are expelled or extracted through the urethra, is of modern, and indeed of very recent invention ; for, notmthstanding that A'arious rude and incomplete attempts may at different times have been made with this view, it was not until about the year 1818 or 1820 that the subject began to attract serious attention : and to the French Surgeons is undoubtedly due the great merit of having not only introduced but perfected this operation. About this time Civiale, followed by Amussat, Leroy, and others, began con- structing instruments, which, though very imperfect, yet were sufficient to break down a calculus in the bladder. This was publicly done by Civiale in 1822. From this period the system made rapid j)rogress ; and the successive improvements made by the Surgeons whose names have just been mentioned, together with the ingenious mechanical adaptations introduced by Weiss, Heurteloup, Costello, and Charriere, enabled Sm’geons to attack the stone with certainty and effect. It is principally due to the labours of Civiale in France, and of Brodie and Weiss in this country, that the system has been brought to its present state of perfection; whilst the practice of lithotrity has been largely adopted and urged upon the Profession by Sir W. Fergusson, Coidson, Sir H. Thompson, and many other Siu’geons. To Sir Hemy Thompson more especially, the Profession is indebted for having laid down Avith precision those rules by Avhich the operation may be performed vath as much simplicity as safety. For the safe and proper performance of this operation, the Surgeon must not only be acquainted with the general principles on which it is undertaken, but he must be thoroughly conversant with the more minute details in the construction and the manipulation of the instruments employed, as well as with the state of e\'ory part of the urinary organs. It is impossible for any Surgeon who wishes to practise lithotrity successfully, to devote too much time and attention to these points of detail. IXSTRUIIKNTS.—The instruments required for lithotrity are the following. An ordinary so^ind Avith a short beak is required to examine the condition of the bladder. The steel sound should be holloAV, so that the bladder may, if8o8 URINARY CALCULUS. necessary, be injected through it after or during sounding, without the neces- sity of changing the instrument (Fig. 750). This will be found of much service in the later stages of the operation for detecting small fragments. A Irass sijrimjo, with rings, and having a large piston rod, so that it may work easily, should be at hand, and admit of adaptation to the liollow sound. The Surgeon should also be provided with silver catlieiers of three different kinds : one with large lateral eyes, another with a large eye in the convexity, and a third with a large eye in the conca's'ity near the. point (Figs. 773, 774, 775) ; all having an elastic gum bougie fitted to the interior, instead of a stylet, to clear out the fragments (Fig. 776). These should also fit to the syringe. The instrument foy breaking the stone consists of a lithotrite, as represented in the annexed cuts (Figs. 760, 765, 766) ; or a similar instrument worked by a rack and pinion is employed by Fergusson. The hthotrite must be made of well-tempered steel; and should be tested by being made to crush a piece of sandstone grit, of about the size of a walnut. It should be of as full a size as the urethra will readily admit; it must have the male blade well serrated, and the female or under blade open at the beak, with an oval apertuio, through which the detritus of the crushed stone is forced, and thus any entanglement of it between the blades is prevented (Fig. 760). The object of this open-bladed Hthotrite is to break the larger and harder stones into pieces ; but it is not intended to pulverise smaller calculi and fragments. 759. Litliometer Somul for measuring stone. It is liollow, so tliat the bladder can lie emptiwl ’ and injected through it. The Hthotrite should be cut out of a bar of solid steel, and not, as is the case with some instruments, made of a plate of this metal, tmmed up at the edges , as such an one possesses too little strength to be used with safety on large and hard calculi. Those cut out of a bar of metal have an external blade, ha^ng a gi-ooved shape, as in Fig. 764. In this, the male or internal branch, cut to fit accurately (Fig. 763), slides smoothly, the whole instrument possessing anrEEPARATION OF PATIENT FOR LITIIOTRITY. 809 I' ig. 701. Fig. TOi Fig. 703. nmount of strengtli and power that no calculus can resist. The bent-up instru- ment is composed of an outer tube of metal, as represented in its transverse section (Fig. 7G2), in which the internal blade fits less accurately (Fig. 7(if), and which possesses less strength, csiDcciall^^ at the elliow, than the lithotrite cut out of the solid. The scoop may, however, be constructed of bent metal without danger. Civiale’s lithotrite, such as is repre- sented in Fig. 7()5, has a most ingenious double action, enabhng the Siu-geon to work it either by the hand or by a screw. In this instrument, there is no fenestra in the female blade. It is of two kinds. In one, the male blade is much naiTOwcr than the female ; in the other, it is nearly as broad. The first kind is useful in crushing through moderate-sized stones ; the second kind, with the broad male blade, is used Fig. 704.

PAriENT.-Before proceeding to the operation of 'I y, It IS necessary that the patient’s constitution should be carefully bowels should be freely opened, and the condition of the li^estne organs regulated, aud, more especially, all local irritability about the 111 iiiaiy organs should be subdued by ordinary medical treatment. This is oyen o much greater importance in lithotrity than in lithotomy. In lithotrity we m^t always expect that any existing irritation or inflammation of the b^ be increased by the necessary introduction of instruments, and b^thc l>resc„oo of fragments of calcolu, i„ bladder, and tboir J ge aWUlUNAliY CALCULUS. the urethra but iu lithotomy all source of irritation is at once removed )>y the- extraction ot the stone. The condition of the urinary organs must be very carefully examined : and, if these be diseased, it will probably be requisite to abandon the operation. In a subsequent part of this Chapter, when we come to the comparison of lithotomy and lithotrity, we shall exdmine the conditions which either indicate ■01 negative the pcifoimance of the latter operation. At present, Ave will, suppose a case in Avhich the Surgeon may have recourse to lithotrity Avith every prospect of readily and permanently freeing the patient of his calculus ; one in which the calculus is of moderate size, single, and not too hard ; the lu-inary organs healthy, and not over sensith-e ; and the patient an adult, but not too aged. ^ In performing the operation in such a case, but little preparatory treat- ment is required ; though it is well to keep the patient quiet for a few days,, and to regulate his boAvels before anything is done. Should the patient’s health not be iu a satisfactory state, or should his urinary organs be irritable, he must j be treated on ordinary medical principles until his health be sufficiently restored for the Surgeon safely to-undertake an operation. Shoidd the patient be iierA'ous about the use of instruments, or should the lu-ethra be in-itable, a large sound may be passed every second day, so as to accustom the patient and the parts to the use and contact of instruments. L SE OE Ajy^TtSTHETics.—Much difference of opinion exists as to the advisa- bility of employing chloroform iu lithotrity. It has been objected to its use that the sensations of the patient are an useful guide to the Surgeon in his manipulations ; and that, if these be annihilated by antesthetics, injury may be done by the lithotrite nipping or otherwise bruising the mucous membrane. But this objection is not tenable. It is the sensations of the Surgeon, and not those of the patient, that constitute a valuable guide ; although in the majority of cases lithotrity, when properly performed, is almost a painless procedure. Yet cases not unfrequently occur in which the patient can with difficulty support the necessary manipulations, and in Avhich, either from nerA'OUSuess or from irritability of the bladder, he ejects his urine on the introduction of the lithotrite, or even does not allow his bladder to be duly distended by-injection. In such cases chlorofoim is of inestimable service ; and many patients when anses- thetised can be safely subjected to hthotrity, avIio could not suffer the operation under other circumstances. Operation.—The operation of lithotrity may be divided into three stages : 1. The Introduction of the Instrument. 2. The Search for and Seizure of the Stone. 3. The Crushing of the Stone. 1. Introd-action of the Lithotrite.—Lithotrity may most conveniently be performed with the patient lying on his back either upon a hard mattress, or on a couch or table. If the patient be very stout, or the prostate enlarged, the pehds may be raised by a hard pilloAA", so as to allow the stone to roll up on | the posterior siuface of the bladder. The Surgeon, standing on the right side of the patient, carefully introduces the holloAv sound, or catheter, and di’aAvs off the urine ; he then sloAvly and very cautiously, injects the bladder, by means^ of the brass syringe, Aidth from fom- to six ounces of tepid Avater. The use off drawing off' the urine is to make sure of the bladder holding the propci •quantity of fluid Avhen it is afterwards injected ; and the object in injecting it.SEIZURE OF THE STOXE. 8if is to distend it with fluid to such an extent as to prevent the mucous membrane from being seized in the grasp of tlie lithotrite, or injured by the splintering ol the stone. The instrument is then withdrawn, after the situation of the stone- has been detected by it, and the lithotrite is introduced. Should the patient be able to hold enough lu’ine to protect his bladder from the action of the lithotrite or the fragments, the injection may be dispensed with, and the lithotrite may .-7 at once be used. As this is straight, with a sharp clboAv near the beak, some little skill is required in passing it. In / doing this the Surgeon must / keep his eye upon the short ; curved beak of the instrument. ! the direction and position of i which must be constantly ob- served or rather judged of; and especial care must be taken, in canying it under the pubes, not 'to injure the ‘OV.-IntroUuction of tUe Lithotrite. m’ethra by pushing the heak of the lithotrite forwards too suddenly, instead of winding it, as it were,, under the arch of that bone. The instrimient should first be introduced nearly parallel to the abdomen, the penis being held between the left fore- and middle fingers, and drawn over it. As the lithotrite passes down, it must be gradually raised to the perpendicular position ; and as its curi'e passes under the pubes, the handle should be depressed between the thighs (Fig. 767). The direction of the curve is the thing to bear in mind ; and the position of the handle must be varied in accordance with the course which this takes. The hthotrite should be well greased with olive oil, so that the branch and screw may work smoothly. Lard or ointment should not be used for this puiqDosc, as it is apt to clog, and to entangle gritty bits Of calculus. 2, Seizure of the Stone.—The next point is to seize the stone, which will generally be found in the situation where its presence was detected duiing tlie sounding of the bladder. If large, the stone will probably lie low', near the neck of the Idadder ; if small, it is most frequently met "with at the right side, or at the inferior fundus. Should it be situated in a depression in this region, it may most readily be seized by introducing a finger into the rectum, and raising up the lower part of the bladder ; or, better still, by raising the pelvis on a hard pillow, and so causing the stone to roll up on the posterior surface. Brodie strongly advises that the lithotrite should never be used as a sound to- asceitain the position of the stone ; if this be done, the patient suflers pain, the bladder is in-itated, the urine is expelled, and the stone not readilyURINARY CALCULUS. Sl2 seized. In seizing the calculus, a good deal of tact is required. 'J'here arc two ways of seizing the stone. Brodie recommends that it should be done by pushing the female blade of the lithotrite against the inferior fundus of the bladder, pressing gently down with it so as to make a conical depression in <! this situation, and then inclining the beak towards the stone, drawing back ihe male blade with the thumb (Fig. 7G8) ; with a slight shake or jerk, the ■Surgeon then tries to get the calculus between the blades, at the same time •that the male branch is being pushed forwards to seize it. In this manceuvre the female blade should be moved as little as possible, but the stone must be seized by pressing the thumb upon the half-circle of steel fixed on the male branch. In this way the stone may often be seized at the first attempt, but in other cases it is not grasped until after several efforts have been made to fix it; the calculus, especially if round, slipping away from between the blades of the instrument, and being merely scraped liy them. Civiale adopted another . I f' I t- Fig. TOO.—Civialo’s llotlioa of Seizing the Stone behind the Prostate. procedure (Fig. 709). In passing the lithotrite, he lelt where the stone la} i813 BREAK ING THE STOXE. lio tliGii very jjGiifcly turned the beuk of the instruuient toAvnids the opposito side of the bladder, opened the Idades, and then, turning them over towards the stone, seized it between the open blades. In those manoeuvres, all rough handling must be most carefully avoided, and the instrument should bo turned about as little as possible. It is far safer to desist in the operation, if there be anv diffieulty in seizing the stone, than to persevere in repeated and fruitless attempts, by Avhich the bladder may be severely injured and inflamed. Kather than do this, the patient should be allowed to get up and move about for a feAv minutes, when the position of the stone may be so far altered that it will admit of being seized. 3. Breaking the Stone.—When the stone has been seized, it is gently raised in the grasp of the lithotrite, so as to be placed about the middle of the- bladder, and it is then crushed. The important step of the operation, like all the others, requires to be deliberately and carefully done (Fig. 770). If Civiale’s impi'OA'ed lithotrite be used, the stone, if small, may often readily be crushed by the pressure of the hand alone Avithout the action of the scrcAV (Fig. 771).

The shorter the sittings, the more likely will the case be to do well, ihe first sitting should not exceed four minutes, and the subse- • quent ones be as short as possible. In the repetition of the sittings, the Sur- ,geon must be guided by the effect produced on the stone and on the bladder. The calculus may be entmely destroyed in one sitting, but most commonly from, three to five or six are required ; these should, if |3ossiblc, l)o conducted at in- tervals of three or four days, though this must depend upon the amount of irritation induced by them. At the first sitting, it is sufficient to break up the stone; the frag- ments being left to bo dealt with subsequently. This sitting is by far the most important of all; it should not occupy more than about a very few minutes. After the stone has been broken up, the patient should be made to lie in bed on his back for about twenty-four hom-s, be kept warm, and be plentifully supplied with diluents. He should pass water in an urinal, and not be allowed to stand up or to loan forward, lest the fragments fall against or become fixed in the neck of the bladder, whore they may produce great irritation and distress. Much of the success of lithotrity will depend upon the gentleness with which the proceedings are conducted during the first sitting, and the care with which the patient is managed for a day or two subsequently. Before withdrawing the lithotrite, the Sm’geon must be careful to see, by the scale on the handle, that the male blade is well home. If this be not the case, and the instrument be enlarged by any fragments or detritus being entangled between the blades, laceration of the neck of the bladder or urethra might occiu- in attempting to withdraw it. After the stone has been broken, little detritus will usually escape during the first twenty-four hours ; but after this it is expelled, iu some cases in con- siderable quantity, each time the urine is passed. In others, it docs not escape so readily ; and then the Surgeon requires to introduce Civiale’s instrument (Fig. 765), by which he can seize the smaller fr'agments, crush them, and, screudng the instrument home, extract the beak filled with detritus. In using this instrument, however, care must be taken not to get hold of too large a fragment; for in breaking this up, whether by the hand or screw, the Ijeak may Be clogged with the detritus in such a way that it does not readily close, and then there may be considerable difficulty in withdrawing it. Should this ■accident occur, the scoop may be emptied by passing its beak back into the bladder, tapping sharply upon the instrument, and moving the male branch to and fro. In crushing ffagments behind the prostate, Civiale turned the concave part of the beak downwards, and seized the fragment this position (Fig. 769). In doing this, however, great care must be taker, not to nip the mucous membrane of the bladder. There is a difference iu the practice of Surgeons Avith respect to Avashing out the bladder. Thompson very usually does not do so ; other Siu-geous Avash out the bladder after each sitting, except the first, with tepid v'ater. Ibc most convenient instrument for this purpose is a full-sized silver catheter.LitUotrity Catheters. Fig. 773.—Eyes at Extremity. Fig. 774.—Eye in Concavity. Fig 775.—Bye in Convexity.

In using the latter instrument, the point of which should be directed towards the in- ferior fundus, a considerable quantity •of water may sometimes with adi^antagc lie pumped through the bladder by •udaptiiig a flute-valve syidiige or elastic bottle to it. Clover has invented a most ingenious ■tind simple instrument (Fig. 776), for washing out the bladder. It is es- pecially useful in the latter stages of the operation, and more particularly in clearing the organ of the last fragment. The interval between the sittings will vary according to the effect produced. If all go well, the second sitting may usually take place about five or six days after the first, and they may then be repeated at intervals of from three to four days; each sitting should be short—not exceeding five to eight minutes. A¥hcn the Surgeon believes that the bladder has been •emptied of all fragments and detritus, Vk final exploration must be made. This last aet of the operation is necessarily one of the greatest importance, as on the precision with which it is conducted depends in a great degree the future immunity of the patient from a recurrenee of the disease ; any fr’ag- 7nent, however minute, that is left behind necessarily constituting the nucleu.s •of a further calculus. The exploration is best conducted by means of a small lithotrite, the bladder containing but a moderate quantity of urine. The w'hole of the in- terior, but especially the part behind the prostate, should be carefully •explored ; and if any fragment be found it must be crushed, and the detritus •extracted. Civiale employed the “ trilobe,” allowing the urine slowdy to trickle •out through the shaft of the instrument, at the time when he drew and closed :the blades over the floor of the bladder, by pushing the tubular shank over them. As a measure of additional safety, the exploration should be repeated .after the lapse of a wnck or two, and the bladder be well washed out after each proeedure. During the whole of the treatment, it is necessary to adopt means to allay arritation. AVith this view the patient should be kept in bed, or on a couch ; .a moderate diet only should be allowed, plenty of demulcent drinks given', such as bai’ley-water, soda-water, or milk; and opiates or henbane, if neces.sarv, .should be administered.UlUNA B Y CALCUL US. 8i6 The amount of irritation of the hhulder developed after lithotrity will vary greatly in different cases. In some, where the stone, when unbroken, has excited miich pain and irritability of the organ, the sufferings arc at once lessened by its being broken up. It is diihcult to account for this, except on the supposition that the fragments, being spi’cad over a wider surface than the unbroken calculus, press less directly on any one part, and so produce less local irritation. More frequently, however, the crushed stone produces much greatei- irritation than the unbroken one. In this respect, how'cver, much Avill depend Apimiatus. upon the care that is taken after the operation.

In such unfavourable circumstances no time is to be lost. The patient should be anjesthetised, the bladder injected with weak belladonna solution, the • lithotrity-seoop introduced, the fragments broken up as completely as possible, and detritus taken away or washed out. No other means than this, or litho- tomy, will save the patient ; and nothing is more remarkable than to witness the immense relief that the patient derives when the large angular fragments are broken up into detritus. Accide^:ts IK Lithotrity.—In considering the accidents in lithotrity, I put out of consideration those that may arise from the Surgeon acting care- lessly, or with improper force, and thus occasioning laceration of the urethra, or injury to the coats of the bladder ; so also accidents occurring from the bending or breaking of the instruments wiU scarcely happen, if these have been properly tested on a piece of sandstone grit before being employed in the bladder. Impaction of Angular Fragments of Stone in the Urethra.-—This is 1 a most dangerous and painful accident, and not only occasions great local irri- tation, ending perhaps in cystitis or abscess, but may give rise to severe rigors and nervous prostration. It most commonly arises either from the Surgeon attempting to do too much at the first sittiug, or from the patient moving about too much, or straining to pass urine after the stone has been broken. The fragments are especially apt to lodge in the prostatic urethra, or about the bulb, and there give rise to a very great degree of irritation, and even of fatal mis- chief, producing great constitutional distm’bance of an irritative and asthenic type. lYhen the pieces are impacted low down in the urethra, it is absolutely necessaiy to remove them from the canal as speedily as possible, lest the consti- tutional disturbance occasioned by them prove fatal to the patient. This may be done in various ways. Most frequently, they may be pushed back into the bladder, by passing a large catheter carefully down to them. The most con- venient instrument for this pm-pose is one that is open ended, so that the fragment may be received in the aperture at the end of the instrument, and so pushed on before it. Through such a catheter as this a stream of water may be injected, and the fr’agment thus forced back. Should these manoeuvres fail, it has been proposed to crush the fragments in the urethra with a small litho- trite (Fig. 777) ; but this plan is somewhat hazardous, as it is very difiicult to Fig. 77".—Urethral Lithotrite. avoid pinching up the mucous membrane of the canal with the bits of stone, ihe safest practice seems to be, either to extract them through the urethi’al orifice, or to cut them out through the perinamm. Extraction through the urethral orifice may be effected by the forceps (Figs. 778, 779), or by Civiale’sURINARY CALCULUS. instrument (Fig. 257, Vol. I.). Should these means fail, or should the frao-ment be very deeply seated, as in the membranous portion of the urethra, and the local and constitutional irritation produced by it be so groat as to threaten abscess or a fatal termination, the better plan would be to make an incision directly down upon it, and to remove it through the perimeum by a median Fig. 779.—Uietluul Forceps, with AJligator-jaw action. The smaller figure presents the Jaw of Forceps opened. operation of Kthotomy. If such an operation as this be required, the Siu’geon might possibly feel disposed to extend the incision a little, and empty the bladder of any remaining detritus by means of a scoop. The Clironic Enlargement of the Prostate of old people corqjjlicates seriously the operation of hthotrity, not only in rendering the introduction of instruments more difficult, but in offering an obstacle to the expulsion of the fragments. Enlarged prostate cannot, however, be considered to be by any means an insuperable bar to hthotrity ; as, after the stone has been crushed, the bladder may be emptied by means of the scoop, by Clover’s apparatus, or by Sir P. Crampton’s device, which consists in exhausting the air from a pro- perly constructed bottle, fitted with a stop-cock, and then attaching this to a catheter previously introduced, and opening the stop-cock, when the pressine of the atmosphere drives the contents of the bladder, mine and grit, into the exhausted bottle. As a general rule, it is not desirable to turn the blades of the lithotrite downwards, lest the fioor of the bladder be injured. But in •some cases in which a small stone is lodged, or fragments have fallen into a pouch behind the prostate, or in which the prostate is enlarged so as to form a bar which rises above the floor of the bladder, it vill be impossible to seize the calculus or the fragment, imless this manmuvre be adopted. In doing this, risk of injmy vill be materially lessened, if not altogether removed, by some- what depressing the handle of the lithotrite, and thus preventing all downward pressure of the blades, which are gently opened and closed over the base of the bladder.ATONY OF THE BLADDER. 819 Daggers ix Lithotrity.—The principal dangers in lithofcrity arise from the state of the bladder and kidneys. They consist in the induction of ■C'ystitis of a iow form, Atony of the Bladder, of Eenal Indtation, or in the occurrence of Pya3mia, with much constitutional disturbance of a low type. Cystitis may occur in consequence of the increased in-itation to which the bladder is subjected. It sometimes occurs during the earlier period of the operation, in consequence of the irritation of the bladder by large and angular fr-agments, and subsides at once when these arc crushed up and pulverised. Bhould it continue, it speedily assumes a low form, and is apt to prove fatal by the induction of acute secondary inflammation of the kidneys or septi- offimia; even if it do not do so, its continuance is an insuperable obstacle to the fru-ther crushing of the stone ; and in cases of this kind the best course that could be pursued will be, after getting the patient into as favourable a state as possible, to remove the fragments by lithotomy. Atony of the Bladder is one of the most dangerous conditions that can •occiu’ in lithotrity. This state of things happens usually in old people, in whom the urinary organs may appear to be in a peculiarly quiet and favour- able condition before the operation, the patient being able to hold his urine for six or eight hom’s, and to bear the injection of ten or twelve ounces of fluid. In these circumstances, the Surgeon should be upon his guard ; for the danger of this condition is, that the bladder does not possess sufficient contractile power to expel the fragments. These consequently acciunulate in the lower fundus, and imtate the mucous membrane, and thus the founda- tion may be laid for fatal cystitis, which in these cases always assumes a typhoid type. The atony of the bladder appears to arise partly from that natural want of expulsive power, which is not imfrequent in old people, and partly fr’om a kind of paralysis of the organ, induced by the contact of the instruments, especially after long sittings, and by the pressure of the fragments, by which the bladder is, as it were, overpowered. Such patients usually die with severe constitu- tional depression, and with suppurative inflammation of the kidney. When atony of the bladder has come on, it is essential that the Surgeon should rid the patient of the fragments which he is unable to expel. This may sometimes be done by means of the scoop, assisted by washing out the bladder through the large-eyed catheter ; but the safer plan would probably be, to get the patient into as good a condition as possible, and then cut him. IhisI once did in an interesting case under my care at the Hospital; the patient, an old man, had been lithotrised by a Surgeon out of doors a few weeks before admission, but no fragments had passed ,• on sounding him, I found a moderate-sized calculus, with what appeared to be a large mass of soft concretion, of the natm-e of which I was not aware until after its removal • ‘ the patient having concealed the fact of his having been lithotrised.

S20 Disease of the Kidneys is in Lithotrity as in all other operations on the urinary organs, the most common cause of danger and of death. The various forms of fatal kidney-disease have been so fully described in Chapter IjXVI [. that I must refer the reader to it. Constitutional Disturbance.—Very considerable constitutional disturbance occasionally follows lithotrity. The patient is seized with severe and long- continued rigors, followed by profuse sweating, lasting for many hours. These, serious symptoms are most apt to come on after the first sitting, and are ana- logous to those nervous phenomena that are apt to follow upon the intro- duction of instruments in strictures, &c. They may pass off, leaving merely a temporary debility; or a typhoid state may set in ; the pulse becoming cpiick, feeble, and intermitting, the skin hot and dry, and the tongue bromi. This condition is apt to prove fatal, either directly, or by intercurrent visceral mischief; it appears to arise in many cases from causes independent of the operation, or that are called into activity by the shock and slight constitu- tional disturbance induced by it. This is more especially apt to happen, when there is latent disease of the kidneys. Indeed, there is no condition of system that is more directly antagonistic to the success of lithotrity than, chronic disease of the kidneys. When this occurs to any considerable extent, with or without much albumen in the urine, casts of tubes and blood, the increased irritation induced by the operation will almost to a certainty prove fatal. In other instances, again, the fatal result is more directly dependent. on the irritation induced by the operation leading to the formation of abscess in the neighbourhood of the prostate, or around the neck of the bladder; and in other instances, again, oir the supervention of unhealthy suppuration in some of the sacculi that are occasionally met with in this organ. From whatever cause arising, this condition is usually eventually fatal by the supervention of suppuration of the kidneys or septiceemia, and is un- doubtedly often predisposed to by the previous existence of chronic renal disease. The Treatment of this state of things should consist in the free adminis- tration of stimulants—brandy, ammonia, and ether—followed by a full dose of opiate, and abundant warm diluents. Especial care must be taken not to repeat the sitting for at least a week or ten days after the rigors have passed off. Perineal Lithotrity.—After a stone has been broken up in the ordinary operation of lithotrity, it occasionally happens that the fragments become a source of so much irritation that the crushing operation has to be abandoned, and lithotomy is required, in order to relieve the patient. Again, during the operation of lithotomy, the operator may meet with so largo a stone, that he cannot extract it with safety, and he then breaks it up in order to remove it in a fragmentary manner, or the stone may be so soft that it crumbles imdcr the pressure of the forceps. These circumstances, familiar to all lithotomists, have led various Sm'geons to recommend, as a formal operation, the breaking up of ' calculi before extraction, in order that the removal of the broken stone might be effected through a smaller incision than would be required foi its extraction if entire. Without going back to the records of ancient or even mediceval surgery for illustrations of this operation, it suflices to say that in modern times such a procedure has been advocated by many distin-perineal LITHOTIUTY. 82 1 guished Surgeons, more especially by Malgaigne, under the term of “ Litho- to a formal opoi-atioo "^n Perimal Litholrill/r those procediu-ce ivhich were toimclly undertaken Avithont any very definite rules. • , <* cfno-P<; • 1 The The operation itself is extremelj simple.

M. Uolbean gives very minute directions for the proper performance of the various stages of the operation. They resolve themselves into the simple rules of a moderate external incision, very slow and methodical dilatation of the prostatic urethra and vesical neck, and complete “ fragmentation ” of the calculus. From our knowledge of Avhat happens Avhen a stone is accidentally broken by the crush of the forceps during an ordinary lithotomy operation, we should not entertain veiy sanguine views of the results of the same procedure Avhen piu-posely performed. The delay in extracting the broken fragments is great—the bladder emptied of its urine contracts upon and is irritated822 URINARY CALCULUS, by them, and the uncertainty and diffieulty of clearing away all fragments by means of forceps, scoop, and injections, are very considerable. The accident is one that is justly dreaded and guarded against as far as possible by the practical lithotomist. Resulls.—Tlio results of perineal lithotrity do not either appear hitherto to- have been very brilliant or even satisfactory. In thirty operations there were five deaths, which, considering that at least four of the patients were under twenty years of age, is folly as high as, if not higher, than what ocem's in lateral lithotomy, and far exceeds that resulting from lithotrity. Apphmhililij.—When we compare perineal lithotrity with ordinary lithotrity, or lithotomy, whether lateral or median, it presents positive disadvantages in many cases, no advantage in others, and appears only to be apphcable to a few exceptional instances. In cases of small or medium-sized calculi, the results of ordinary lithotrity are infinitely more satisfactory ; and no object can be gained by complicating this operation with an incision into the urethra. For ordinary calcuh, too large for lithotrity, the lateral and median opera- tions offer fully as successful if not more successful results than those which have been obtained by perineal hthotrity; and very few Surgeons would, when once they had seized the stone, trouble themselves to break it up before extracting it, or subject their patient to the delay in the operation that always occurs, even when the stone is accidentally broken after seizure—a delay oc- casioned by the prolonged manipulations which then become necessary, and which are not without their own special dangers. The only cases, indeed, in which I can conceive perineal lithotrity to be adopted by a Siu’geon, are those in which he has to do with a very lai’ge soft phosphatic calculus. As such a stone almost inevitably crumbles down when seized before extraction, it might possibly be as weU to convert into a step of a regular operation that occurrence which would otherwise happen as an accident in ordinary lithotomy. Should it become necessary, after ordinary lithotrity, to cut a patient for the speedy extraction of the fragments, Dolbeau’s method of dilating the neck of the bladder, and his small forceps, might be found useful. COMPARISON BB TWEEN LITHOTOMY AND LITHOTRITY. Lithotomy and hthotrity differ so entirely from one another in principle and detail, that it is useless to attempt to establish a comparison between the different steps of these two operations. It is, however, a question of the very first importance and interest to ascertain by which operation a patient can most safely have a calculus removed from his bladder. In determining this point,^ it is not only necessary to make a comparison between the general results ol cases that have been subjected to the two procedures, but more especially to ascertain those circumstances that infiuence the result of each operation in particular cases—to determine, in fact, in what cases lithotomy, and m what lithotrity, holds out the best prospect to the patient. It is, I think, m the highest degree unpractical to enter into a discussion as to which should be theSTATISTICS OF LITHOTOMY AND LITIIOTBITY. 825 o-eneral method of treatment in cases of stone. That Surgeon shows his practical skill the best, who knows best which operation is the one most appropriate to the particular case before him, and who knows best howto apply the operation that ho selects to the case to which it is applicable. Both operations haye been reduced to great simplicity and certainty ; but neither should be exclusively practised. It is undoubtedly the duty of the Surgeon to make himself familiar with the practice of both, and to adopt that one which promises best in the particular instance with which he has to do. In all cases in which it is practicable, and in aU cases even in which the chances of the two operations arc evenly balanced, lithotrity should as a matter of humanity be preferred to lithotomy. Probably about four-fifths of all cases of stone occuiTing in the adult are proper for lithotrity, and the proportion would be much greater if the patients applied earher for relief, or if, instead of being subjected to medical treatment, they were at once put under proper Surgical care, and the stone detected. Statistics.—The statistics cannot represent the true state of the question so far as a general comparison between the operations is concerned. For it must be borne in mind that those cases that are lithotrised have invariably been picked ; whilst hthotomy has been performed on almost ah patients indiscriminately as they have presented themselves. For lithotrity to be suc- cessfully done, it is necessary that the stone be of moderate size, and that the urinary organs be in a healthy state and free from irritation ; and this is the state in which most of the cases have been, in which crushing has been done. In hthotomy cases, on the other hand, the Surgeon has had to contend with all the difficulties of large or multiple calculi, diseased bladders, and bad con- stitutions. Hence, in comparing the statistics of the results of lithotrity with those of hthotomy, we compare the statistics of the results of operations per- formed under the most favoinable circumstances on a series of selected cases, with those of cases taken indiscriminately and often presenting most unfavour- able conditions. Another cause of uncertainty with regard to the statistics of hthotrity has been this ; that up to a recent period those which we possessed were chiefly from a professed lithotritist, Cmale, the accuracy of which had been denied in a veiy decided and emphatic manner by many of the leading Surgeons in Paris, who had inquired fully into the matter; and the conclusions from which must necessarily be received with much hesitation in this country, where it is difficult to anive at the real truth of the statements advanced on either side. If we compare Civiale’s statistics of hthotrity with those of hthotomy, as practised liy the most skilful Surgeons, Cheselden, Liston, and the Norwich operators, we should at once decide in favour of the crushing method; for Civiale states that out of 5!)1 operations ho had but 14 deaths, or 1 in 42’2 ; whilst, as we have seen, the most skilful lithotomists in this country, where tlie results of the cutting operation have been far more successful than else- Avhere, can only boast of such a rate of mortality as 1 iu 7*0, or at most in 10. But though the success is thus stated by Civiale to have been great in his own cases, the accinacy of this statement has been denied by other French Suro-eons and it is certainly voiy different from what has occurred elsewhere. Thus of824 URINARY CALCULUR. 1G2 cases operated upon by litbotrity by various Surgeons in Pai-is, Ci\'ialc states that death resulted in 38, and a cure in 100 instances; the results of the remaining cases being unknown, or the cures incomplete. In this country it is impossible to say, even approximately, what the average mortality after lithotrity has been ; but I believe there is a very general feeling that, in many of the London hospitals in which it has been performed, lithotrity has not been a very successful operation. The same remark appears to hold good Avith regard to the Parisian hospitals ; Malgaigne estimates the mortality ft-om lithotrity in these institutions at 1 in 4, while he calculates that of private cases as 1 in 8. This difference between the results of this operation in hospital and in pri\'ate practice can easily be accounted for by the difference in the constitutions of the patients, and by their applying for relief in priA'ate in a less advanced form of the disease than in hospital practice. We find that the same holds good with regard to the results of lithotomy. Thus, Coulson states that Dudley lost only 1 in 36 of the private patients that he cut; Mettauer, 1 in 36j ; Martineau, 1 in 42 ; and Mott, 1 in 50. These results are fully as favom’able as Giviale’s statistics of lithotrity, and shoAv the influence which the constitution of the patient, and a proper selection of cases, may exercise upon the results of the cutting operation. The only statistics of lithotrity that we at present possess are those given by Brodie, Fergusson, Keith, and Thompson as the result of their practice. Brodie’s cases were almost entirely private ones ; and many occurred early, before the art Avas perfected, hence they are scarcely fairly apphcable to the present day. He states that, out of 115 cases of lithotrity—not all, however, on different indi- Auduals, the operation haAdng been repeated more than once on several of the patients—he lost 9. Of these, death was directly attributable to the operation in 5 instances ; and in the remaining 4, it Avas dependent on organic disease, brought into activity by the shock of the operation. Fergusson lost 12 out of 109 cases, and Keith 7 out of 129. Thompson’s statistics show by far the most favom’able results that have yet been obtained. He operated in 184 consecutive cases, of which only 3 were under 30 years old, the mean age being 61, the oldest 83, and in 46 cases 70 and upwards. The recoveries, excluding every kind of casualty, amounted to 93 per cent. Ko case was left unfinished; in no case was lithotomy required; and in 13 cases only was a second operation demanded. Lithotrity, as has ah’eady been stated, cannot be applied to aU cases of stone; in most that are unsuited to this operation, lithotomy may be done AA’ith success. In some cases, however, no operation can be practised, in consequence of serious disease of the genitals, bladder, or kidneys, or of some visceral mis- chief that would necessarily interfere with the performance of any capital operation. The necessity of selecting cases of lithotrity is well instanced by a statement that Civiale has given with reference to this point. This dexterous lithotritist considered that, of 838 calculous patients aaLo applied to him diu’ing a series of twenty years, only 548 were fit cases for lithotrity, and 290, or more than one-third, Avere not operated on hy this method ; of the last 322 cases included in this list, 241 were lithotrised, 1 in 3’6 being considered unfit for that operation. Of the 91 cases not crushed, 28 were cut, and in 8 otheis lithotrity and lithotomy were combined. Of these 36 cases subjected to litho-825 SELECTION OF OPERATION. tomy, Civiale lost 18, or exactly one-lialf. These figures show that lithotrity cannot be considered the only operation for stone ; but must, even in the hands of the most dexterous and successful practitioners, be in many instances replaced by the cutting operation. Selection op Operation : Lithotomy or Lithotrity.—The circum- stances that must chiefly determine the Surgeon in the selection of the particular operation to be performed are—1, The Age of the Patient; 2, the Size and Character of the Stone ; and 3, the Condition of the Urinary Organs. 1. Age.—The age of a patient is an important element. As a general rule, it may be stated that at the middle and advanced periods of life lithotrity is most successful; while, in early ages lithotomy is the preferable operation. In children under the age of puberty, the genito-urinary organs are undeveloped ; the urethra is small, and the bladder narrow. These conditions not only necessitate the employment of instruments specially constructed of reduced size, and render great care in their manipulation requisite, but the narrovmess of the lu’cthra is especially apt to render the expulsion of the fragments of the crushed stone extremely difficult, and to favour their impaction. If, in addition to this, we bear in mind the great sensitiveness of the bladder in young children, and their restlessness under the repeated sittings which may be necessary, it can easily be understood that lithotrity is neither an easy nor a safe operation in them ,• unless the calculus be so small—not larger than a cherry-stone—that it can be crushed aud brought away at one sitting. Ijitho- tomy, on the other hand, is so successful an operation in children, that the Surgeon would gain nothing by substituting lithotrity for it. Thus, of 35 children under 10, operated on by Cheselden, only 1 died ; and of 58 children cut for stone at St. Thomas’s, but 1 case proved fatal; and the average mor- tality of lithotomy cases in children is not more than about 1 in 14. Guersant, at the Children’s Hospital in Paris, has performed lithotrity in children 40 times 35 of the cases being in boys : of these, 7 died, and 3 at least of the others required to be afterwards subjected to hthotomy. Of the deaths, 4 were caused by croup and scarlatina, and 3 were attributable to the operation. These resffits are anything but satisfactory when compared with those of lithotomy in children in this country, or even iu Guersant’s own practice ; for, of 100 that he cut, 14 died. I think that the best and most experienced Surgeons are agreed in this, that, although lithotrity is jiracticable on boys, yet lithotomy, beiug much safer and far speedier, should be preferred to lithotrity in all patients under puberty, and in most under twenty years At veiy advanced periods of life, the iiTitable state of the miuary organs, the tendency to the supervention of low cystitis, and the enlarged state of the prostate, are often such as to prevent the performance of lithotrity with any prospect of success. At the same time, the success of lithotrity in old age has leen very great m the hands of some Surgeons. Thus, Segalas states that, of 14 octogenarians whom he lithotrised, he did not lose one ; and of 27 septua- genarians, but two. Lithotomy, on the other hand, is very fatal in a^ed persons. It 18 at the middle period of life, or in persons who, though advanced inURINARY CALCULUS. 826 years, preserve their powers unimpaired, that lithotrity is most generallv apphcable and is most successful. 2^. Size and Character of the Stone.—With regard to the size of the stone. Surgeons generally recognise the fact that a small stone is more favour- able to lithotrity than a large one. All calculi below one inch in diameter may be ciushed, piovidcd other circumstances are favoux’able. In regard to larger calculi, it is, as a general rule, not well to attempt to crush a stone that is above one inch and a half in diameter ; much, however, will depend on the composition and density of the calculus. The objections to lithotrity in any given case are, not that a large stone cannot be broken, because in most cases this can be done ; but that the fragments may be so large, angular, and sharp, as to require separate crushing to enable them to pass ; that their quantity would be so great that the bladder would in all probability not be able to expel them ; or that their presence, and the necessary operations for their disinte- gration and removal, would produce a dangerous amount of irritation. This is especially applicable to lithic acid concretions, giving a clear and ringing sound, the fragments of which do not disintegrate, but split up into sharp and angular spicula and scales. Oxalate of lime calculi, occurring chiefly in young people, comparatively rarely admit hthotrity, but, when crushed, break up very readily; and, as there is usually a co-existing healthy state of the urinary organs, the cases have a favourable issue. Phosplmtic calculi, which are soft and fi’iable, and do not yield ang-ular fragments requiring repeated disinte- gration, may, even if of larger size than that mentioned, be broken up. Some of the French lithotrisers are in the habit of breaking up friable phos- phatic calculi of from fifteen to twenty lines in diameter. At the same time, the shattered state of system, and the irritable condition of the urinary organs accompanying phosphatic calculi, often counterbalance the advantage that would otherwise have been derived from the character of the stone. If there be several stones, the propriety of performing lithotrity will depend in a great degree upon the size of the calculi. If these be small—not larger, perhaps, than small nuts, and not very numerous, the bladder being healthy— the operation may be performed with safety. I have removed successfully in a few sittings five or six calculi about half an inch in diameter. But if the calculi be larger than that, lithotrity is not a very successful procediu’e ; for, though each calculus may not be very large, yet the aggregate of the whole is considerable ; and, besides this, the calcuh wiU each require a separate opera- tion, as it were, and may each contain a hard and possibly very resisting nucleus. Occasionally the bladder contains a large number of small pea- shaped calculi. These may be successfully broken up, and washed out through a large-eyed catheter ; from 50 to 100 separate ones may be thus removed. Sometimes a calculus, after having been broken up into several fragments, has been left in the bladder, each fragment forming the nucleus for a new stone. Such cases are usually most successfully cut; but in favourable cir- cumstances as to the condition of the luinary organs, they may be subjected to lithotrity. 3. The Conditions of the Urinary Organs that influence the pio- priety of performing lithotrity or lithotomy have relerence to the state ot the Jcidneijs, the Madder, the urethra, and the prostate.CONDITION OF UNINARY ORGANS. 827- As a general rule, it may be stated that, the greater the inflammatory tendency of the urinary organs, the loss successful will hthotr ty be. The repeated introduction of instnments, however carefully and skilful y conducted • the presence of fragments of calculus, and their tendency to impaction or entanglement in the urethra, necessarily dispose to inflammatioiv ci-en in the most favourable cases, and very readily excite it, if there be any tendency to such action existing in the parts. If, however, the stone be sma , or of moderate size, and friable ; the bladder healthy, and of good contractd& power • the urethra capacious ; and the patient of soimd constitution and quiet tempciiment, the stone may often be broken up and the fragments expelled with comparatively little suffering. In fact, in such a combination of favour- able circumstances, lithotrity ought unquestionably to be preferred. If, however, the bladder be very irritable, or if the patient’s constitution be- an excitable one, so that he does not well bear the introduction of instru- ments ; more particularly if it be found that this local and constitutional sensitiveness, instead of being blunted by the methodical introduction of sounds or bougies, is rather increased thereby ; and especially if the stone be- of such size that several sittings would be required—lithotomy should be- employed. The existence of organic disease, however, about the urinary organs, con- stitutes the greatest obstacle to lithotrity ; and, when extensive, must form a complete bar to the performance of that operation. It is not easy, however, to determine the amount of local disease that should thus be held to contra- indicate hthotrity. On this point the opinions of Surgeons differ much ; and it is particularly in the management of these cases that the advantage of the- tact and dexterity in the use of the crushing instruments, which habit can alone give, is well exemplified. The condition of the Mdneys merits special attention. If these organs be diseased, as indicated by the presence of casts of tubes, or of a considerable quantity of albumen in the urine, or in any other way, the performance of a scries of operations in the bladder would be likely materially to increase the mischief in them, and consequently ought not to be undertaken. Organic disease of the kidneys is a more serious obstacle to lithotrity than to lithotomy, on account of the prolonged nature of the operation, and the greater liability to sympathetic or propagated inutation in these organs, giving rise to purulent nephritis. It is not only by the operation increasing the renal mischief that harm might result, but also in consequence of the tendency to low and diffuse inflammation of the bladder, prostate, and surrounding areolar planes, and to pyainia, that always co-exists with kidney disease. Ihe conditions of the bladder that interfere seriously with lithotrity ai’o partly functional, partly organic. The functional derangements are of two ■\-ery opposite kinds ; viz., a state of extreme irritability of the organ, and an abnormal want of sensibility of it—a state of atony. The organic lesions con- sist of hypertrophied, fasciculated, sacculated, and permanently contracted states of the viscus, which is then most commonly irritable as well. A chronically inflamed or irritable state of the bladder, more particularly if the organ be thickened and fasciculated, so that it will not bear the injec- tion of a few ounces of tepid water, seriously interferes with the success ofUlUXARY CALCULUS. S28 lithotrity. xV very irritable and sensitive bladder not only will be the seat of {severe sulfcring on the introduction of instruments, but may not be aide to hold sufficient urine to make the operation a safe one, and may readily become dangerously inflamed in consequence of the repeated introduction of instru- ments, and the presence of angular fragments. Hence, if the ordinary opera- tion of sounding occasion much distress ; if the patient cannot hold his imine long, but pass it in small quantities ; if it be bloody, or much loaded Avith Auscid mucus, he Avill scarcely be able to bear the procedures necessary for the operation. In some instances, however, the irritability of the bladder may be •overcome, and in all it may be materially lessened, by keeping the patient in bed, and, as Brodie recommends, daily injecting tepid AA'ater. If the bladder be sacculated, there Avill still be a greater risk of an unfavourable result; the •sacculi not only retaining fragments of calculus, but also becoming the seats of unhealthy inflammation, in consequence of which asthenic cystitis of a veiy serious character, followed by pysemic symptoms and metastatic abscesses, may result, leading in some cases to perforation of the peritoneum. In such cases as these, early lithotomy offers the only chance to the patient. The existence of a moderate amount of vesical catarrh, if the bladder be othenvise healthy, is no objection to lithotrity. In encysted calculus, lithotrity is, for obvious reasons, inadmissible. Atony of the htadeter is not only a serious inconvenience, but a great soincc of danger in lithotrity. It caimot in all cases be positively ascertained before- hand ; though it may be suspected if the patient can hold his urine for a great many hours, and can bear without complaint the injection of a large quantity—eight or ten ounces—of fluid, the interior of the bladder feeling large and smooth to the sound. This condition chiefly occurs in old men of feeble habit of body; and, if ascertained, calls for the performance of lithotomy. As Civiale has pointed out, this condition may be a source of great danger after lithotrity, the organ not possessing sufficient expulsiA^e poAver to rid itself of the fragments with Avhich it is encumbered, and of the presence of which it seems to be insensible, so far as the feelings of the patient are con- cerned ; Avhile its low vitality renders it peculiarly liable to subacute cystitis, excited by the presence of the fragments in the loAver fundus. It must be borne in mind, that this atony of the bladder may, especially in feeble and aged individuals, be induced by the contact of the instrument, and especially by prolonged sittings. If the urethra be the seat of strictiu-e, or be very irritable, lithotrity which may require the frequent introduction of instruments of large size, and A\ill entail the continued passage of fragments of calculus cannot be perfomied. Stricture of the urethra does not, however, absolutely preA'ent the peifoimance of lithotrity, but only retards the operation until the constriction can be pio- perly dilated. Should this, however, be not practicable to the Ml extent of the urethra, lithotomy on a small staff must be practised. Moderate enlargement of the prostate, such as is often met AVith m elderly people, does not necessarily prevent the performance of lithotrity ; undoubtedly compheates the operation. The introduction of the hthotri c Avill be attended by considerable difficulty; and the fragments have a tendency to become lodged in a pouch of the loAver fundus behind the enlarged glam .recurrence of CALCULUE. 82c> This more especially happens it the middle lobe be enlarged ; and in these circumstances, though the stone may undoubtedly be crushed, yet the fiag- ments would probably require to be removed by the scoop ; the operation would consequently be very tedious and prolonged, and lithotomy would probably be found to answer best. Any inflammatory disease or abscess of the prostate must necessarily prevent the performance of lithotomy. I have said nothing in this comparison between lithotrity and lithotomy of the comparative painfulness of the two operations ; for, as chloroform may be administered with equal adi'antage in both cases, there is little difference in this respect, except that perhaps the advantage lies on the side of lithotomy, as being the shorter proceeding. Froni all that precedes, then, it would appear that, useful as lithotrity unquestionably is in many, even in most, cases, it cannot be looked upon as an universal means of treating stone in the bladder, being only safely applicable in favoimable conditions of the urinary organs, to calculi that are small, or at most of but moderate size, and after puberty ; and that a large number of cases will always be left in which lithotomy offers the sole means of relief. Choice of Operation of Lithotomy.—The particular operation of htho- tomy to which recourse should be had, will also vary according to the cha- racter of the stone. If this be small, and the patient an adult, the medmn operation may advantageously be performed. If it be of moderate or tolerably large size, and more particularly if the operation be practised on a child, the kderal appears to me to be the more applicable. If, again, the calculus be of inordinate magnitude, the suRra^iibic, the medio-hilatercd, or the redo-vesical operation should be the method selected. In fact, the Surgeon should not con- fine himself too exclusively to any one method of operating, but should adopt that procedure which appears to be best adapted to the special circumstances presented by the particular case before him, and should vaiy his method ac- cording to the state of the luinary organs, the age of the patient, and the size and character of the stone. The Result of Operations for Stone will depend in a gTeat measure upon the condition of the bladder, and the character of the stone. If the bladder be healthy, all symptoms will cease on the removal of the calculus, and the patient will be restored to perfect health. This usually happens when the calculus is of the lithic acid or the oxalate of lime variety, and of renal origin. If, however, the bladder be unsound, irritable, and the urine alkaline from de- composition, and disposed to the deposit of phosphatic matters, the calculus, being phosphatic, and chiefly, if not wholly, vesical in its origin, then an irritable state of bladder may be left, or may speedily return after the opera- tion, whieh will consequently have been productive of little, or only of temporary benefit. ^ Recurrence of Calculus after Operation.—This may take place fr’om four distinct causes 1, in consequence of a continuance of the constitutional condition or diathesis, under the influence of which the calculus was originally fonned; 2, from the descent of a renal calculus; 3, from a fr-agment of calculus aving been accidentally left in the bladder ; and 4, from the accumulation of phosphatic deposit in the inflamed fundus of the bladder, or in the line of im- perfectly healed incisions.Ul^INARY CALCULUS. S30 Relapse from the first cause is probably not very eommon. When it occurs •^e recim-ent calculus is of course of the same composition as the primaiy one’ The occasional occuiTence of relapse shows the necessity of continuing consti* tutional treatment adapted to the particular diathesis, after the removal of the •calculus from the bladder. Recurrence of calculus from the descent of a new stone from the kidney every now and then occurs, and is especially liable to be met with in those cases in which the primary calculi are multiple and small. In these cases, the relanse may take place very shortly after the first operation, and will be preceded by the usual symptoms of the descent of the renal stone. Relapse fr-om the retention of a fragment which serves as the nucleus of another stone, will undoubtedly occasionally occur, although its occun-encc is fairly attributable to want of due care on the part of the Siu-geon. It is apt to happen more frequently after lithotrity than after lithotomy, and it is pro- bably to this cause chiefly that we must refer the greater liability to relapse •after the crushing than the cutting operation. But it may happen after lithotomy, that a fr-oigment is left behind when the stone has been broken •diu-ing extraction, and the bladder not thoroughly washed out. But even in this case, the bit of stone will usually be carried out of the wound by the flow of mine through it. ReciuTence from the formation of a phosphatic calculus in the bladder, or perhaps outside it in the track of a partially healed woimd, ydll occasionally ■occui* after either operation, as the result of a low form of cystitis favouring decomposition of the urine and phosphatic deposits. I have known such deposits to form both in the bladder, and in the perimeum, where the wound had degenerated into a sinus. The registers of the Norwich Hospital show 1 relapse in 58 cases; and those of LuneviUe, 1 in 116 cases of lithotomy (Coulson). After lithotrity, relapse is more common ; although it is probably less frequent now than formerly, and will become less frequent as the details of the ■operation come to be better understood, and are more carefully practised. In the practice of Civiale it has occurred about once in every tenth case. But this estimate, high as it is, falls below what happens in surgical practice generally. Civiale states that, of 36 private patients on whom he operated in 1860, 10 had previously been operated on, the stone having reappeared. This must eAudently arise from some fragment of calculus having escaped detection and being left behind, thus constituting a nucleus for a fresh formation. The fr’equency of the occurrence of secondary calculi after lithotrity, even in such practised hands as Civiale’s, if it do not constitute an objection to that opera- tion, shows the necessity of the Surgeon most carefully examining the bladder before he pronounces the patient cured ; and even then watching him for some length of time, in order to meet the recuiTent calculus at its first formation, and to adopt means for its early removal. Lithotrity cannot therefore be said to be so complete a cure in all cases as lithotomy. Not only is reciuTcnce of calculus more common after the former than after the latter operation, but it not uncommonly happens that patients who have been lithotrised successfully, and in whom no recurrent calculus has formed, continue to suffer for a great length of time afterwards fr’om very distressing irritability of the bladder.URETHRAL CALCULUS. •o-nrl r\Vvi-ki-i<- J.'Urt -i? - 1 I , 1 O J which resists in the most obstinate manner all the ordinary methods of treat- ment. This is not the case after lithotomy ; when a patient once recovers, his bladder usually regains its tone completely, and no trace of evil conse- quences is left. 'Treatment.—In the event of a secondary calculus forming, whether after lithotomy or lithotrity, either method may again be employed, according to the nature of the case. Most generally, the bladder may be cleared of the recurrent calculus by means of the lithotrite. If lithotomy have previously been performed, and it be thought proper again to have recourse to it, this may be done again in the usual way, through the cicatrix left by the former wound; or the Surgeon, if ambidextrous, may adopt Liston’s advice to cut through the right side of the periiiEeum on a staff with a groove to the left of its convexity. As this procedure, however, would entail the use of the left hand for cutting and extracting, most Surgeons would prefer either the opera- tion through the site of the old wound, or, better still, the median operation. Whatever procediu-e, however, may be adopted, it should be borne in mind that the rectimi may have become rather firmly adherent to the membranous portion of the urethra and the apex of the prostate, in consequence of the •contraction of the old cicatrix, and may thus be endangered. Calculi are not unfrequently found impacted in the urethra, especially iri childi-en. These are most commonly formed in the kidney, whence they pass into the bladder, and thence into the urinary canal, through which they usually escape, but in some instances lodge in it, more especially at the bulb or in the navicular fossa. These calculi are commonly of the lithic acid or oxalate of hme varieties; they are generally round, but not uncommonly •elongated or spindle-shaped. But, although most urethral calculi are undoubtedly renal in their origin, formed m the canal. They will then be found to be phosphatic, are usually •consequent upon stricture, and may attain a large size. In some cases these concretions are moulded in the prostatic and bulbous portions of the methra being elongated, rounded at one end, and pointed at the other. In other in- stances, again, they appear to be formed in a pouch that lies to the outside of the imethra, and that is only connected with it by a small aperture.

AVben called, therefore, to a child suffering from this condition, we should always at once suspect urethral calculus as being the cause, and examine the urethra by the perineeum or rectum, or by the introduction of a sound. Treatment.—The treatment of urethral cal- culus will vary in the adult and in the child. In the adult, urethral calculi may be removed by extraction, incision, or lithotrity. When situated towards the anterior part of the canal, an urethral calculus may frequently be extracted by quietly working the stone forwards between the finger and thumb, the patient being under chloroform. Should this plan not succeed, it may be removed by passing a long and very narrow-bladed pair of forceps down to it, by which it is seized and drawn forwards ; occasionally, when it has reached the navicular fossa, it will not pass through the urethral orifice unless this be dilated by incision with a probe- pointed bistoury. If the calculus be too large to be extracted in this way, and appear to be firmly fixed, an incision may be made down upon it, through the urethra, by which it may be removed. It is a good rule not to make this incision in any part of the urethra anterior to the scrotum ; for, in consequence of the coverings of the penile portion of the m’ethra being very thin, the aperture will probably not be closed, but a fistulous opening left. When the stone is situated in the scrotal portion of the urethra, there would be some risk of abscess and of urinary infiltration if the incision were made through the lax tissues of the scrotum. Hence it is better, if possible, to push the stone back towards the membranous portion of the canal, to cut down iipon it, and extract it through the perinmum by an incision in the mesial line. Should it not be thought advisable to cut the patient, the stone may be pushed back into the bladder, and then crushed by a lithotrite. This operation may readily be done by passing a staft^ grooved along its convexity, or an ordinary director, as far as the calculus, and making an incision upon the end of it, so as to lay open the urethra ; the staff is then removed, and the calculus extracted by means of a slender pair of forceps. A catheter should next be passed into the bladder, and retained there for a few days, in order to lessen the tendency to the forma- tion of urinary fistula. It may happen that the calculus, impacted in the urethra, is only one of several; others being lodged in the bladder. In order to ascertain this, the Surgeon should, after removing the calculus for which the operation has been performed, pass a sound into the bladder, so as to ascertain whether any other concretions exist in that organ ; and if so, they should at once be removed by extending the incision of the membranous portion of the urethra into the bladder, by the median operation of lithotomy. I once saw Liston extract two vesical calculi, after having removed one that had blocked up the urethra, by converting the perineal incision into that of lateral lithotomy. Fig. 781.—Extra-urethral Oalculas.833 IMPACTED AND PliOSTATIG CALCULI. Impaction of a Calculus in the deeper portion of the urethra of a boy may lead to very serious consequences. In tlie majority of instances it occa- sions mo]-e or less complete retention of urine, which requires relief. This may be given in one of two ways. 1. If the stone be near the urethral orifice, it may be extracted, and, 2, if situated more deeply, it may be pushed back to the perinecum—there fixed by the finger, and cut down upon in the mesial line. It should never bo pushed back into the bladder, as such an act would lead to the necessity of lithotomy. If the stone is allowed to continue fixed in the urethra very serious conse- quences may ensue, by the ulceration of the urethra by the pressure of the stone, which escapes into the areolar tissue, the formation of urinary abscess in the perinmum, followed, perhaps, by the extravasation of urine into the scrotum, aud its diffusion along the superficial fascia in the usual direction, with the ordinary disastrous results of inflammation and sloughing that accompany and follow such infiltration. In this condition, the boy, after suffering from the ordinary symptoms of vesical calculus, will become affected by intense instability of bladder, the urine passing with much pain every few minutes ; or incontinence even Avill set in. Some purulent discharge will be observed about the meatus, and there vnU be some hard ill-defined swelling in the perinaBum, Avith much tenderness in this region. On passing a sound, no stone probably Avill be found, as this has escaped from the urethra, and is lying in a pouch in some part of the perinmum, and in the midst of broken-doAvn areolar tissue and pus ; into this cavity the sound aauU readily pass. The Treatment in these cases is simple. It consists of introducing a grooAmd staff, placing the boy in the lithotomy position, and then freely incising the mesial fine of the perinmum, so as to open up the luinary abscess ; in this the stone may be found, or it may be so enveloped in the sloughy tissues as to escape detection ; perhaps it will escape through the wound in a few days, and be found lying on the bed. Should there be much hcEmorrhage, a petticoated lithotomy-tube should be introduced. If extravasation of urine have occurred, free incisions must be made in the usual way, and the child Ido put upon a stimulating diet. PEOSTATIO CALCULUS. Prostatic calculus differs from all other urinary concretions in situation and composition, being formed in the ducts of the prostate gland, and composed prmeipally of phosphate of lime and some animal matter ; usuaUy about 85 per cent, of the phosphate, to 15 of the organic ingredients. Sometimes, also, the concretion is said to consist of carbonate of lime (p. 75G). It generally occurs m old people, though it may sometimes be met with in young subjects. From a ad of nineteen, Avhom I cut for vesical calculus, I extracted two prostatic calculus is usually of a grey or ashy colour, some- Avhat triangular m outline, smooth and polished (Fig. 782} ; havino- facets cing veiy hard, and seldom much larger than a cheny or plumstone T thouo-h may occasionally attain a considerable bulk, haAung been met with as lai^e 3 H^34 URINARY CALCULUS. as a hen’s egg, and then presenting a branched or in-egular appearance. Though usually hut one or two exist, which are sometimes deposited in a kind of cyst in the organ, as many as thirty or forty have been met with, the ducts being filled, and its whole tissue being studded with them. Symptoms.—Calculus in the prostate gives rise to a sense of weight, pain, and irritation in the perinmum, some- retention of urine, and, in fact, to the ordinary symptoms of enlarged and irritated prostate; it often occasions a tolerably free discharge of mucus in the urine. On introducing a sound, this passes over the stone, sometimes rubbing or striking it with a distmet grate or click before its beak enters the bladder. This is increased by the finger in the rectum pushing the organ up, and thus bringing the stone into more direct contact with the sound. In some instances the calculus is deeply imbedded in the prostate, and cannot be touched by the sound. In these cases the stone may usually be felt through the rectum. If there be many small calculi in a sacculus in the prostate, they may be felt by introducing the finger into the rectum, when a peculiar crackhng or grating sensation may be experienced by the rubbing together of the calculi, something hke that produced by beads in a bag. Treatment.—The treatment of prostatic calculus will depend upon the situation, size, and number of the concretions. When they are large, single, or at most two or three in number, readily struck with the sound, and situated on the urethral surface of the organ, the ordinary median operation may advan- tageously be performed, and the calculus removed with a scoop or forceps. If the calculi be small and very numerous, not to be felt with the sound, but only through the rectum, it will be wiser not to have recoiu'se to operation, which could not remove the whole of the concretions. In such circumstances, a palliative treatment directed to the subdual of the irritation of the prostate, and the use of the catheter to relieve retention, is the only course to pursue. When prostatic and vesical calculi occiu’ together.', the same operation wiU rid the patient of both forms of the disease. (For foreign bodies in bladder, vkh Vol. I., p. 651.) CALCULUS IN THE FEMALE. Stone is of rare occurrence in women ; in London, certainly, it is not often met with. Thus, South states that, during a period of twenty-three years, 144 males were operated on for stone at St. Thomas’s Hospital, and only 2 females. In some districts, however, stone would appear to be more common in women than this. Thus, according to Crosse, at the Norwich Hospital, the proportion has been about 1 woman to 19 men. Civiale states, as the result of his researches, that in the North of Italy, the proportion is 1 to 18 ; and in France, about 1 to 22. At the University College Hospital we had not had ‘ a case of stone in the female for many yeai’s until 1855, when three came under my care in the com’se of a few months : and since that period many have occmi’ed. Vesical calculi in the female are often nothing more than phosphatic incrus- | tations deposited around some foreign body that has, either accidentally or835 CALCULUS IF THE FEMALE. from depraved motives, been passed up the urethra and has been dropped into the bladder. In this -vvay hair-pins, pieces of bougie, of catheter, or of pencil, will often be found to form the starting point and the nucleus of the concretion. Symptoms. The symptoms of stone in the female closely resemble those that occur in the male, and its iiresence may usually be easily detected by means of a short and nearly straight sound, or a female catheter. It is often simulated very closely by the irritation occasioned by a vascular urethral tumour, or by an irritable bladder ; but exploration of the auscus will always determine the diagnosis. Largo calculi may be met with in very young female children. I have removed an uric acid calculus incrusted vdth phosphates, measuring inch in length by ^ inch in breadth, from a little girl four years old. The stone was removed mibroken, by gradual dilatation of the urethra. In the adult they may attain a very large size. I have extracted one from a young woman measm'ing 8 inches in its long, and 6 inches in its short circumference. . Calculus in the female bladder, if allowed to remain um-elieved, will not only occasion the various morbid conditions in the lu’inary organs that have been described as following the long-continued presence of stone in the male, but will give rise to diseased states peculiar to the female. Thus the stone may be spontaneously discharged through the urethra ; if of small size, with- out any bad results following ; but if large, by a process of ulceration, in consequence of which permanent incontinence of urine will remain : or it may slough through into the vagina: or lastly, it may offer a serious obstacle during parturition to the descent of the foetal head, when, if it cannot be pushed aside to be dealt with afterwards, it must be cut out, or craniotomy be per- formed. Kemoval.—stone may be extracted from the female bladder by one of three methods : 1, l^y Lithectasy, through a dilated urethra ; 2, by Lithotomy ; 3, by Lithotrity. These different operations cannot be employed indiscrimi- nately, but each one is more especially adapted to certain kinds of calculus. 1. Lithectasy may be performed in two ways—either by simply Dilating ilia Urethra by means of a sponge-tent or dilator, or else by Incising the Mucous Membrane at the same time that the canal is being expanded. a. Simple Dilatation of the urethra may be effected quickly by the intro- duction of a three-bladcd dilator, which is rapidly screwed up. In this Avay, in a few minutes the eanal may be easily dilated sufficiently to allow the introduction of a pair of forceps, and the extraction of a calculus of moderate size. Some Smgeons prefer a slow process of dilatation, continued through many hours, by means of a sponge-tent; but this appears to me to possess no advantage over the more rapid expansion, and has the [very decided disadvan- tage of prolonging the patient’s sufferings. In the absence of a proper urethral dilator, it is always easy to dilate the canal by means of the finger. With this A icAV a director is first passed, and along this the Surgeon gradually insinuates the tip of his finger, and then soon succeeds in expanding the urethra suffi- ciently for all ordinary purposes. 1. Dilatation may be employed conjointly Avith incision, in order to 3 H 2836 UlilNAliY CALCULUS. prevent injurious stretching of the urethra, and consequent laceration of its niucons membrane. The incision should he made after the m-ethra has been dilated to some extent, a probe-pointed bistoury being introduced by the side of the canal, and the mucous membrane divided. Brodie made an incision directly upwards; Liston downwards and outwards on each side—on the whole, I think, the best direction for the incisions, as more space may thus be obtained. By dilatation, either alone or with incision of the mucous membrane, small stones may readily be extracted ; and those calculi that are formed by the phos- phatic incrustation of foreign bodies, may be removed in this way. I have thus extracted, by dilatation, a full-sized gum-elastic bougie from the bladder of a young woman. In the removal of moderate-sized calculi, however, the great objection to this operation is the liability to incontinence of urine resulting from it. It is difficult to say to what extent the urethra may be dilated without incontinence resulting ; this must necessarily vary in different individuals. It certainly can be expanded sufficiently to allow the introduc- tion of the index-finger, and the extraction of a stone eight or ten lines in diameter, without any evil resulting. The incontinence of m’ine that may be left after the removal of larger calcuh than this may not be by any means complete ; but a weakened state of the sphincter of the bladder results, so that the patient cannot hold her urine for more than an hour or two at the most. 2. Inithotomy in the female may be performed in a variety of ways. There are, however, only three modes of practising this operation that appear to me to deserve serious attention ; viz., the SuprapiiLic, the Urethral, and the Vaginal. The Suprapubic or high operation in women differs in no very material respect from the same procedure in men ; except that it requires additional care in consequence of the difficulty there is in causing the female bladder to retain enough urine or water to make the viscus rise sufficiently above the pubes. The extraction of the stone is easy, as it can be raised into the grasp of the forceps by being pushed up from the vagina. Urethral Lithotomy is a very simple and efficient operation. It consists in placing the patient in the lithotomy position, and tying her up. A gTooved staff is then introduced into the bladder, and a shai-p-pointed bistomy, giuded by it, is pushed through the floor of the urethra, about an inch and a half from the meatus, the canal being divided directly downwards. The forceps may then be readily carried into the bladder, and a calculus of good size removed. After the bladder has been cleared, a full-sized catheter should be introduced, and left in the bladder, and the cut edges of the lu’ethra brought together over it by two or three points of silver sutiwe. Vaginal Litliotoiny is an operation easy of performance. It may be practised by passing a straight grooved staff into the bladder, pressing the end well do^vn against the anterior wall of the vagina, and fixing it there with the left index finger. A scalpel is then pushed through the anterior wall of tlie vagina and inferior fundus of the bladder into the groove in the staff, which is made to enter just behind the urethra, and is then run backwards for about inch ; through the aperture thus made the forceps is passed, and the stoneLITHOTOMY AND LITIIOTRITY IN FEMALES. 837 extracted. The incision into the bladder through the anterior vaginal wall should bo brought together by metallic sutm-es, as in ordinary operations for vesico-vaginal fistula, and may thus be successfully closed, as has been done by J. Lane, Aveling, and others. ,. ^ On Comparison of those throe operations, urethral liihotomy is certainly the easiest, the least severe at the time of its performance, and the least likely to be attended by after evil consequences. It is quite sufficient for the extrac- tion of all ordinaiy calculi. The only possible evil that may result from it is the want of union of the incision. But should this happen, a plastic procedure at a subsequent period can easily remedy the defect that would thus be left. Both the high and the vaginal operations are easy of performance. In the Mjh operation, there would, mth care, be but little risk of injuring the peri- toneum ; and the chance of nrinary infiltration, Avhich is a serious objection in the male, may be prevented in the female by the introduction of a siphon •catheter into the urethra. The vaginal operation, though easier of perform- ance, is open to the objection of possibly leaving a permanent lu’inary fistula. If, however, the lips of the incision have not been bruised by the forceps, or in I the extraction of the stone, and be immediately brought together by metallic sutures, the risk of a fistula is, after all, not great. Vaginal lithotomy may, in some cases, be the only alternative. I extracted, by this operation, a calculus measiu’ing eight inches by six in circumference, from the bladder of a woman twenty-three years of age, Avho had suffered from symptoms of stone from childhood. The stone by its size offered so serious an obstacle to the descent of the foetal head during parturition, that craniotomy had been rendered necessary ; the anterior vaginal wall had been a good deal bruised, and I feared that sloughing of it might take place ; hence I extracted the stone by the vaginal method. Lithotomy is not so dangerous an oj)eration in the female as in the male ; yet death occasionally occurs, especially in feeble children, from cystitis and peritonitis, more particularly if the extraction of the stone have been tedious and deficient, the bladder being much manipulated. 3. Lithotrity in the female requires to be practised on the same principles as in the male. The details of the operation differ, however, in some important particulars. The chief obstacle in the performance of the operation in the iemale, consists in the difficulty with Avhich the bladder retains m*ine or Avater that is injected into it. In consequence of this there is not only great difficulty in seizing the stone, the bladder collapsing and falling into folds around it, but also danger of injm’ing the mucous membrane Avith the lithotrite. In order to cause the bladder to retain the necessary quantity of m’ine, the pelvis must be AA'ell tilted up, and the m-ethra compressed against the lithotrite. It is well not to dilate the urethra before the introduction of the instrument, as the incontinence is thereby increased. The ordinary male lithotrite is not a very convenient instrument to use in the female ))ladder, the handle being aAvkAvardly long. This is especially the case in female children. Hence I have found it convenient to have a shorter instrument constructed, Avith Avhich it is far more easy to manipulate in the female bladder. If mine or Avatcr cannot be retained, the calculus may moreCALCULUS. saloly be seized and crushed by means of a snnll nnri of 11 i i mi.o..,*ccps: o,if .fe ie fo of the shape of that depicted in Fig. 783. In prfoming hthotrity in the female it is not necessary to pulverise the calculus, but merely to break it up into fragments of such a size as to admit of easy extraction through the urethra. After the stone has been broken up, the urethra (unless this have previously been done) may be dilated by means of the two-bladed instrument to a mode- rate degi’ee, the larger fragments re- moved by means of a pair of slender forceps, and the detritus and smaller fragments cleared out of the bladder by repeated injections of tepid water. The whole of the fragments and detritus should be removed at one sitting. The shortness and wide capacity of the female urethra will readily allow the escape of any detritus that may un- avoidably be left. For all calculi in the female bladder, except those of the very largest size, this operation is the most applicable. I have in this way crushed and extracted at one sitting, fr’om the bladder of a lady about 50 years of age, a calculus (phosphatic) fully as large as a hen’s egg. By this operation the stone may be removed piecemeal and at once, without the necessity of dilating the m'ethra to such a degree as to incur the risk of incontinence of urine resulting. Lithotrity may be had recourse to at all ages, in^the very young as well as the old. I have crushed and successfully removed a large calculus from a child three and a half years of age, the youngest patient on whom I have operated by this method. Although the urethi’a of so young a female child cannot without danger of incontinence be dilated to too great an extent, yet it may safely and easily be enlarged sufficiently to admit a moderate-sized hthotrite.

Extroyeusiox op the Bladder, consisting in an absence of the anterior wall of the organ, with defieiency in the coiTesponding part of the abdominal parietes, is occasionally met with as a congenital malformation. It may occur in either sex, but is most common in males. This condition essentially consists in an arrest of development, in consequence > of which the anterior part of the pelvic girdle is deficient, the bodies of the pubic bones being imperfectly developed and the symphysis being absent. The recti muscles separate at their lower part, and pass obliquely outwards to be inserted into the lateral abutments of the pubic bones. A triangular space is thus left, into which the bladder is forced, and where its anterior wall, being fused with the common integuments, becomes deficient and thus leaves the interior exposed. At this spot also the umbilical cord traverses the abdominal waU, and thus the umbilicus wiU be found wanting in all these cases, and the urethra to be in a state of epispadias. The posterior wall of the bladder, being pushed forwards by the pressm-e of the abdominal viscera behind, forms a rounded tumour about the size of a small orange just above the pubes. The surface of this tumom’ is red, vascular, and papillated, evi- dently composed of mucous membrane ; at its lower aspect the orifices of the ureters wfil be observed to open, and to discharge the mine in drops or in a stream. For a full description of the mechanism of the passage of the urine in this malformation, I would refer to a case which fell under my notice, and in which I made a number of experiments on the rapidity of the passage of foreign matters through the kidneys, reported in the Medical Gazette for 1845. This malformation is of the most distressing kind. The odoim constantly exhaled from the patient by the dribbling of the mine is a source of annoyance to himself and of disgust to others. In order to render his presence at all tolerable to others, this dribbling must be prevented by some mechanical con- trivance. With this view the patient should wear a properly constructed instrument to receive and collect the urine, consisting of a hollow shield strapped over the part, communicating by means of a tube with an India- iTibber bottle, which may be attached along the inside of the thigh. Treatment.—Up to a comparatively recent period this condition was considered incurable. Of late years, however, operations have been devised and practised with the view of covering in the exposed bladder, forming an anterior wall to840 DISEASES OF THE BLADDER. the viscus, and restoring the urinary canal; so as to protect the tender extro- verted surface of the bladder, to prevent tlie pain and in-itation arising from contact of the clothes with it, and, by giving a proper conduit to the urine, to save the patient all the annoyance of constant dribbling. The first operation for the remedy of this malformation that was success- fully performed was done, in 1859, by Ayres of New York, in the case of a young woman 28 years of age. He, consequently, has the merit of having been the pioneer in this branch of Surgery. He was followed by Pancoast of Philadelphia, and subsequently by Holmes and Wood of London. Asrves’ Operation.—The operation practised by Ayres comprised two steps. The first consisted in dissecting down a long flap of integument and of super- ficial fascia from the anterior wall of the abdomen above the bladder, and tmming this down so that the cuticular surface was innermost and lay over the exposed bladder as far as its inferior border. Lateral union was then secured in this position, but the lower part of the fiap was left open, so as to allow a free exit for the mine. In this way the bladder was covered in com- pletely by a skin fiap, having its cuticular surface underneath, and conse- quently next to the exposed vesical mucous membrane. The integuments of the abdomen were now sufficiently separated from their areolar connections with the muscles beneath, on each side of the reversed flap, to admit of their shding forwards, and being united by sutures along the mesial line, so as com- pletely to cover in the exposed raw siu’face of the flap. In this way the bladder was overlaid by integumental structm’es, which readily united along the mesial line ; and were the patient a male, little more would require to be done than to dissect up the integumental structures below this flap, and so to close m the epispadias and fonn an anterior wall to the urethra. In xiyres’s case, as the patient was a female, the second step of the operation, which was practised after a lapse of three weeks, consisted in fashioning a covering for the vulva, by dissecting up the integuments coA'^ering the pelvic bones on each side, and uniting them to one another on the mesial fine and to the lower part of the reversed flap. The prmciple of the operations adopted by Pancoast, Holmes, and Wood, is essentially the same as that practised by Ayres—viz., that of raising integu- mental flaps from the abdominal wall, and covering in the bladder by turning the cuticular surface of these flaps towards it. But the details of the operations differ chiefly in this, that the flaps have been taken fr’om the groins and lateral aspects of the abdominal wall, with their bases downwards, so that they might be nourished by the recurrent branches of the common femoral aitery. Wood’s Operation.—A flap composed of the skin and areolar tissue of the abdominal walls above the extroverted bladder is first dissected up. This flap is somewhat square in shape, and its base should con-espond in width with the exposed mucous membrane of the bladder. Its length should be sufficient to cover the whole of the exposed mucous membrane. This flap is turned down with its skin-surface towards the bladder. Then a “pyi-iform flap,” the base of which is about equal in width to the length of the umbilical flap, is dis- sected up from each groin, the base of the flap being “ directed towai-ds the scrotum and thigh ” (Fig. 784). These two flaps are brought together so as to meet in the median line, and to cover in the umbilical Hap, the raw surliiccsOPERATION- FOR EXTROVERTED BLADDER. 841 of the two groin-flaps being in contact with the raw sui’facc of the reversed umbilical flap. The flaps arc then secured in position by hare-hp pins, each pin passed so as to transfix both the groin-flaps and a fold of the umbilical flap beneath, holding the three firmly together (Fig. 785). No sutures are required in the flaps. The edges of the wounds left in the places from which the flaps have been raised are then brought together by hare-lip pins and Avire sutures (Fig. 785), and broad strips of plaster placed across so as to support the parts and to remove as tar as possible any tension from the flaps. The patient must be kept in bed in a sitting posture, with the knees drawn up. If the operation be successful, all the pins and sutures may be removed by about the sixth or eighth day, and cicatrisation will probably be complete Fig. 780. Wood’s Operation liy Lateral Reversed Flans (After AVood.) ‘ ’■ of the bladder beiiio- com- penis^to which an fissimcd to be left a itTanl troublesome fistulm are apt842 DISEASES OF THE BLADDEli. to protrusion of the mucous membrane of the bladder from beneath the new covering at the opening left at the root of the penis (Fig. 786), lead to a gi-adual increase in the size of the opening and a partial return of the symptoms. To prevent this, the fissured penis may be covered in by the following method. The whole front of the scrotum, including the dartos, together with the skin covering the lower side of the penis, are raised so as to form a bridge of skin connected with the groin at each side. This is lifted over the penis, and placed upon a raw surface prepared by turning down a collar or flap from the lower arched border of the new bladder-covering and fr-om the sides of the urethra and penis as far forwards as the gians. A continuous wire suture is apphed to keep the deep flaps in place ; and the transplanted scrotal structures are united to the border of the bladder-covering by a line of interrupted sutures (Fig. 787). The scrotal wound is readily closed by some wire sutm’es. By this means a sort of urethi’a is formed, containing the muscular tissue of the dartos in its roof, which may even give it a slight power of contraction, so as to enable the new bladder to retain small quantities of urine. This second stage of the opera- tion is often somewhat interfered with by erections of the penis. These are best controlled by ice-bags. The knees should be kept drawn up so as to reheve tension, especially in the first stage of the operation. After the cure is complete, the patient is often troubled by the gTowth of hair from the imder surface of the umbihcal flap, and the accumulation of phosphates upon the hairs and in the angles of the new bladder. This is best relieved by extracting the hairs with a pair of forceps, and by using weak acid injections to remove the accumulation of phosphates. CYSTITIS. Idiopathic inflammation of the bladder is of rare occui’rence. This disease most commonly originates either from traumatic causes, as from the passage of instruments, the irritation of broken fingments of calculus, &c. ; or it may arise from irritation produced by the application of blisters, the administra- tion of diuretics, or directly from the extension of gonorrhoea to the interior of the organ. Acute Cystitis.—The Symptoms of cystitis consist not only in local pain and weight about the hypogastric and iliac regions, with tenderness on pressure in these situations, and a good deal of constitutional irritation ; but in the existence of extreme irritability about the bladder. So soon as a few drops of urine collect, they excite so much irritation in this viscus that they cannot be retained, and are expeUed by a kind of spasmodic or convulsive effort, consti- tuting strangury, often accompanied by a good deal of tenesmus^ and great suffering. The urine will be found to be high coloured, mixed with more or less mucus or pus, and often tinged with blood. ^ ^ ■ Tmninatio)i.—K\\ acute attack of cystitis usually terminates in the chronic form of the disease, and thus gradually undergoes resolution. Occasionally, however, it terminates fatally ; and when this is the case, the patient s symp toms commonly assume an ataxic character, the tongue becoming brown an dry, the pulse rapid and weak, and the urine very offensive. On examination after death, it will commonly be found that the inflammation of the bladdci843 CIlRONia CYSTITIS. has ffone on to o-angrene of the mucous membrane, to diffuse peritonitis, or to the formation of abscess, either in the substance of the wall of the bladder or between the bladder and the rectum, with perhaps infiltration of urine in the deep areolar tissue of the pelvis oi the periiicGum. Treatment.—Yha treatment of cystitis is very simple, the disease admitting of little being done in the way of medicines. The free application of leeches to the neighbourhood of the inflamed organ, long-continued soaking in warm hip-baths,°thc application of poppy fomentations or of laudanum and linseed- meal poultices, the injection of emollient cnemata, and the copious adminis- tration of barley water or mucilaginous drinks, will subdue the inflammation and afford the patient great comfort; to these means may be added the administration of antimonials with henbane or opiates. The only salines that are of much use are the citrate and nitrate of potash; and these must be given largely diluted. Chronic Cystitis.—Acute cystitis commonly degenerates into the chronic form of the disease, the symptoms of which closely resemble, though in a modified degree, those that have just been described as characterising acute cystitis, and constitute one of the varieties of the “ iiTitable bladder.” The Treatment of chronic cystitis must be of a moderately anti-inflammatory character, so long as inflammatory action keeps up ; when once this subsides, and the disease falls into an asthenic condition, the management of the disease must, to a considerable extent, be modified. In the early stages, whilst there is tenderness and inflammatory action, leeches, warm hip-baths, poppy fomen- tations, mucilaginous drinks, Avith henbane, and some alkaline remedies, especially the hquor potasses largely diluted, wiU be found most useful, the bowels at the same time being kept open by castor-oil and enemata. If there be much strangury of a spasmodic character, it will best be relieved by cupping or leeching the perinaBum, the internal administration of chloric ether anil opiates, or the cannabis Indica, and the use of morphia suppositories. If the urine become offensive in cystitis, whether chronic or acute, gveat advantage is derived by washing out the bladder vflth a solution of the permanganate of potash or of salicylic acid. Irritability op the Bladder is a condition of very frequent occm’reuce. It is met Avith at all ages, complicates many of the diseases to which the I urinary organs are liable, and arises from a great variety of causes. Symptoms.—The patient has a frequent desire to pass urine ; the fluid is generally ejected forcibly, or even spasmodically, and in small quantities at a time. Its passage is attended by pain of a burning, aching, spasmodic character, then constituting Stranyury, sometimes confined to the body, sometimes to the neck of the bladder, not unfrequently extending to the point ' of the penis, or radiating round the pelvis and doAvn the thighs. The urine : may in the earlier stages, and in some cases throughout, continue to be I healthy ; but more commonly, after the disease has lasted some little time, it I becomes loaded Avith mucus, muco-pus, or pus. When the mucoid secretion is I abundant, viscid, and glutinous, the affection is called Vesical Catarrh. In this stage its duration may be indefinite, more particularly in hidividuals advanced in years and gouty in constitution. I Symptoms of Vesical Catarrh.—In vesical catarrh the symptoms are844 DISEASES OF THE B LAD DEE. Fig. 78S.—Microsoopioal Apioear.mces in Mu- cus of Vesical Catarrli. 1. 1. Mucus. 2.

There is frecment desire to pass urine, which is usually ammoniacal and fetid, and is mixed\vith a lai-ge quantity of glutinous stringy mucus, which gives it a turbid appearance ihe urine, on standing, separates into two parts, the upper beino- dear but the lower consisting of a thick, viscid, slimy or gummy mucus,1)ften semi- opaque and purulent in appearance ; it sticks tenaciously to the bottom of the pot, and when poured out hangs fi’om the edge in long stringy masses. It is often mixed with urinary deposits, more especially of a phosphatic kind. Its microscopic appearances are represented in Fig. 788, ihe alkaline condition of urine in vesical catan’h has been supposed to depend upon the simple fermentation of its mucus; but Niemeyer and Lister have shown that urine mixed with mucus may continue acid for a gx*eat length of time, unless it have become mixed with loxver organisms, with vibrios, &c., which Nie- meyer has supposed to enter the bladder- through badly washed catheters, but which, according to Salisbury, are developed di- rectly from the epithelium of that organ. This chi’onic form of inflammation of the bladder is not unfrequently fatal, death resulting eventually with symptoms of a typhoid character ; the tongue becoming brown and the pulse feeble ; and these conditions are usually associated rvith urtemic poisoning. Pathological Changes.—On examining the bladder after death in such cases, great thickening of the muscular coat and of the mucous membrane will usually be found, together with a dilated and tortuous condition of the veins ramifying upon it, the blood contained within which is peculiarly black. Abscesses may be found in the walls or outside them, circumscribed and bounded by plastic matter. The mucous membrane is thrown into folds and ridges, which becoiiie thickened and hardened, having irregular depressions between them, so as to cause the interior of the bladder to resemble somewhat the inside of one of the cavities of the heart with its projecting columnae carnese. This fasciculated condition is almost an invariable accompaniment of long-continued chronic inflammatory irritation of the bladder. As the organ becomes hypertrophied, in con- sequence of the continuance of the disease, it usually becomes sacculated, the cysts forming at its posterior or lateral parts. The sacculi are of two kinds, both of which are formed by projections between the fasciculi of the wall of the bladder. In the first and least common kind, the muscular as well as the mucous coat is pushed outwards. In the second form of cyst, the mucous coat alone forms a kind of hernial protrusion (Fig. 789). In the cysts thus formed, accmnulations of various kinds may take Fig. 7S0.—Cyst in the Wall of tlie Bladder.irdUTABlLlTY OF THE BLADDER. 845 place : mucus, pus, sabulous matter, and even calculous concretions, not un- frequcntly being met with in these situations. It is the retention of urme> mixed with mucus or pus in these cysts, where it undergoes decomposition, that is a common cause of the great fetor of the urine in such cases. Causes.—Irritability of the bladder may ai-isc, as has already been stated, from a gi-eat variety of causes. These differ somewhat as the disease occurs in men, in women, or in children. The causes of irritability of the bladder in men may be arranged under the following heads. 1. Alorhid Conditions of the Urine.—If this secretion bo preternaturally acid and acrid, and loaded with lithates and the products of imperfect assimilation, it is especially apt to occasion an in’itation of the bladder, attended by pain and a frequent desire to expel the offending fluid. Urine containing oxalates in lai-go quantity is sometimes, though more rarely, a source of irritability of the bladder, which in these cases is perhaps increased by the morbidly sensitive state of the nervous system usually co-existing with these conditions of the urine. In gout, in-itability of the bladder is not unfrequently met Avith. This may in some cases be owing to the acid and acrid character of the urine ; in others, to the excitation of a distinct gouty inflammation of the bladder and prostate, co-existing or alternating Avith the articular form of the disease. 2. Renal Disease, more particularly the lodgment of a stone in the kidney, AviU often occasion sympathetic pains in the bladder, Avith much iiTitability of that organ, so as closely to simulate vesical disease, or even to lead to a suspicion of the existence of stone in the bladder. Tuberculous pyelitis wiU often occasion in-itability of the bladder, so as to closely simulate the symptoms of stone. The presence of the unorganisable deposit in the hilus of the kid- ney, whether it be tuberculous, or calculous, wiU produce the same local symptoms, and is not unfrequently attended by sympathetic in-itation of the bladder, simulating the presence of stone in that organ. 3. Disease of the Bladder itself, as a chronically inflamed state of its mucous membrane, will give rise to pain and irritation on the accumulation of a small quantity of urine, Avith a frequent desire for its expulsion. So, also, when the interior of the organ is fasciculated, or contains cysts, and more especially if there be a tumour in a state of ulceration, a degree of morbid irritability A\'iH be induced, often of the most severe and intractable kind. 4. The Lodgment of a Stone in the Bladder will ahvays, by its mechanical action, by its weight and pressure, by rolling about Avhen the body is in motion, imtate the interior of the organ ; and, in fact, the “ rational symp- toms ” of stone in the bladder are simply those of irritability of that organ. 5. Inflammation, Ulceration, Abscess, or other Diseases of the Prostate, and inflammation, gonorrheal or simple, and abscess or stricture of the deeper por- tions of the urethra, also not unfrequently occasion irritability of the bladder. 0. Various Diseases in Neighbouring Organs Avill occasion this condition. Amongst the most frequent are fissm-e and ulcer of the rectum and anus, piles, prolapsus, intestinal Avorms, gall-stones, and varicocele. Diagnosis. The diagnosis of in-itability of the bladder is easily made ; but it is often a matter of no little difficulty, though of the very flrst importanccv to diagnose the piecise cause ol that irritability. This can of course only be846 DISEASES OF THE BLADDER. done by a careful surgical exploration of the whole of the urinary organs and often of the neighbouring parts ; no mere inquiry into the nature of the symp- toms, no chemical examination of the urine, can do more than establish the fact of the existence of “ irritability of the bladder,” and afford some evidence of a negative kind as to the absence of certain causes. But nothing short of a caicful smgical exploiation by means of the catheter, finger, and sound, of the inethia, piostiatc, and bladder, can enable the practitioner to state noth absolute certainty on what this condition of irritability depends. I have repeatedly seen cases of stone in the bladder, and of prostatic disease, vainly treated by medical means for months as cases of simple “ in-itability of the bladder ; ” the exis- tence of the real cause of the symptoms having been overlooked altogether, until a proper surgical examination of the urinary organs was instituted. So closely, in fact, do the symptoms of vesical irritation, arising from gout, or sympathetic with kidney-disease, simulate those that are occasioned by stone in the bladder, that it is impossible for the most experienced medical practitioner to refer them with certainty to the right cause without exploring this cavity. I have known several patients who had been operated on for stone, and who, some years afterwards, suffered from gouty irritability of the bladder, imagine, but erroneously, that they were labouring under a recurrence of the calcidus, so closely do the two classes of symptoms coincide in character. Treatment.—In the treatment of instability of the bladder it must be borne in mind that this condition is not a substantive disease, but is an assem- blage of symptoms resulting from the influence of a great number of very various causes, which must first be removed before the bladder can recover its normal sensibility and tone. When once the occasioning cause has been removed, whether that be a calculus, or gout, or prostatic disease, or a pile, the remaining local vesical irritation may be removed by the use of weak alkaline and mucilaginous drinks. Many sedatives are of use; some in one case, others in another. Opium and belladonna, either by mouth or in suppository, are amongst the best. Henbane, or Indian hemp, suits some patients; and chloral is amongst the most generally useful remedies. The diet should be carefully regidated, and warm hip-baths used frequently. Cijstotomy.—The disease, when once fafrly chi’onic, may become hopelessly intractable, resisting every means of treatment, local and constitutional; and nothing can be more miserable than the state of the unfortunate victim of an incmrably “ irritable bladder.” In such extreme and long continued cases in which the patient’s life has become a burden to him, in which every constitutional remedy and local sedative has been unavailingly tried, the idea has occurred to Surgeons of incising the inflamed and diseased parts by an operation as for lithotomy. Guthrie, who in 1834 strongly recommended this procedure, states that Sir W. Blizard successfully practised it in several cases as far back as 1806, dividing the enlarged prostate and neck of the bladder with a double gorget. Of late years it has been proposed to make an incision as for median or medio-lateral lithotomy, into the neck of the Ijladder, and, by introducing a caoutchouc tube, allow the urine to drain away. This operation has proved successfid in the hands of Verneuil, and is certainly a proper procedure in hopelessly chronic and otherwise incurable cases. Treatment of Vesical Catarrh.—When vesical catarrh has come on, andinniTABILITY OF THE BLADDER. 847 the disease has lost its active inflammatory character, appe^ing rather to con- sist of atonic exudations from the mucous membrane, a different plan of treat- ment will require to be adopted. In such cases as these, the greatest benefit vnll be derived from warm stimulating and balsamic diuretics. Amongst the best are infusion of buchu or matico in large doses. These remedies are useless, unless taken in quantities of a pint or a pint and: a half in the day. They may be conjoined witla nitric acid and tincture of nux vomica, if the urine be alkaline and the bladder atonic. But no remedy appears to me to possess so much in- fluence over the mere ropy mucoid discharge as the balsam of copaiba. Turpen- tine, cubebs, and tincture of the scsquichloride of iron, will be found useful. It is often difficult to say beforehand which diuretic will suit best, and I can lay doivn no precise rules to guide the practitioner in this respect. But they may often be tried or alternated with advantage. In many cases great tempo- rary relief is obtained fr’om each new remedy, which fails to be maintained. In the more advanced forms of the disease, when typhoid symptoms come on, bark and ammonia will be found most useful, together Avith the administration of the brandy-and-egg mixture. In these cases also it is of great importance to empty the bladder, by means of the catheter, of the viscid mucus that accumu- lates in it, and the putrefaction of Ai’hich, together Avith that of the residual urine, tends to engender the depressed state into which the patient sinks. In some cases, this may advantageously be done by washing it out Avith AA'arm water infections through a double-cmTent catheter. In this stage of the disease, benefit may occasionally be derived from the employment of slightly astringent injections. Amongst the most useful of these will be found the nitrate of silver, in the proportion of one grain to fom- or six ounces of tepid distilled water. Brodie employed water slightly acidulated Avith nitric acid. Irritability of the Bladder in Children appears to be an affection closely allied to the congestive and subacute inflammatory conditions of the different mucous membranes, as of the eyes, nose, and throat, that commonly occur in stramous subjects. In this disease the child passes ui'ine with great frequency and with much pain ; the urine is offensive, and usually phos- phatic; there is much uneasiness complained of about the groins and along the penis ; in fact, many of the ordinary symptoms of stone are present. On sounding the bladder, it wiU be found roughened, fasciculated, and often con- tains sabulous matters mixed with mucus. Occasionally there is a. good deal of gastro-intestinal initation, and not unfrequently worms are present. The Treatment consists in attention to the general improA’^ement of the health, in the removal of intestinal initation, in the regulation of the digestive func- tions, and in the administration of copaiba in small doses, either alone or con- joined Avith a few minims of liquor potassae, at the same time that general antistnunous treatment must be properly canied out, and the bladder washed out from time to time Avith a Aveak solution of the nitrate of silver. Irritability of the Bladder in 'Women often simulates stone so closely, that It IS only after very careful sounding that the Surgeon is satisfied that no calculus exists. This condition depends on a morbidly sensitive state of the mucous membrane of tlie urethra and bladder, that may arise from a A'ai-iety of causes, similar to those described at p. 844, as occasioning irritability of the male bladder. There are some conditions, however, in which it occursDISEASES OF THE BLADDEIt. 848 that aro peculiar to women. 1. It may bo a truly neurotic or hysterical affec- tion. 2. It is often sympathetic : being connected ^viih some local disease of the genito-m-inary organs, with a vascular tumour at the meatus of the urethra or Avith some congestive affection of the uterus, Avhich Avill require to be cured before the bladder can be brought into a sound state. 3. Prolapsus of the anterior wall of the vagina, draAving down the corresponding portion of the bladder, Avill keep up this condition; if so, the prolapsus must bo cured by some plastic operative procedure. In all circumstances, hoAvever, Avhen this state has once been set up, it is very difficult to remove. 4. In many cases it is undoubtedly due to the irritation produced by a morbid state of the urine, dependent on mal-assimilation, and usually connected Avith an excess of lithates. In cases of this kind, careful regulation of diet, and the administration of potash Avith henbane, will afford much relief; but the complaint is of a very intractable nature, and under the most careful treatment will often continue for years. 5. In strumous girls it may be due to a congestiA'e, thickened, and irritated stated of the vesical mucous membrane, similar to that Avhich is met AAuth in other parts of the body, as the eyelids, nose, and throat. In cases such as these, the patient requires to be put upon a general antistrumous treatment, and the bladder should be mopped out Avith a very strong solution of the nitrate of silver. This is best done by dilating the urethra, passing a sdver tube into the bladder, and then through it a small sponge-probang charged with the solution. TUMOUBS AND CYSTS OP THE ELADDEH; AND HJEMATUEIA. Tumours of the Bladder.—The most common tumour of the bladder is the villous. This tumom- is in no way malignant—in the great majority of cases, being more nearly allied to a papilloma. It consists of numerous delicate branched processes floating freely in the urine. On microscopic examination, each process is found to be composed of a capillaiy loop surrounded by an extremely delicate connecth^e tissue, in some parts almost homogeneous, with numerous nuclei scattered through it. The sm-face is covered Avith epithehum similar in character to that of the bladder. These tumours almost invariably grow on some part of the trigone, and usually near the orifice of one ureter. Fragments of them may occasionally be found in the urine, thus”serviug as a diagnostic mark of the nature of the disease. They prove fatal eventually by profuse haemorrhages of a most persistent character, or by the pain they occa- sion and the obstruction to the escape of the mine, thus leading to secondary diseases of the bladder and kidneys (see Vol. I., p. 768). True cancer of the bladder is very rare, and still more rare as a primary growth. When found, it is almost abvays the result of extension of the morbid ^■owth, either from the prostate or from the rectum or uterus. The diagnosis is extremely difficult and uncertain. As the cells usually found in carcinoma resemble in many respects the cells of the bladder epithehum, especially those UTegular epithelium-cells found in the urine daring cystitis, but^ little value can be attached to the presence of such cells in attempting to diagnose this dlS0HiS6 Cancer of the bladder is usually associated with similar disease of theCYSTS OF THE BLADDER. 849 prostate or neighbouring structures, and in Avonien may be secondary to cancer of tbe uterus. According to Walsbe, it does not appear before tbe fortieth year. These tumoui-s, -whether simple or malignant, occasionally become encrusted with 2}hosj)ha(ic matter, deposited upon them by the urine ; and then they will resemble still more closely a calculus when the bladder is sounded ; from it, however, they may be distinguished by their fixed character, and by the impos- sibility of passing a sound around them. Some difficulty is often experienced in examining the bladder in these cases ; for, as the fungous mass pushes back the posterior wall of the viscus, it has a tendency to elongate the prostatic jDortion of the urethra and the neck of the bladder, so that a very long instru- ment may be required to reach it. Little can in general be done in the way of Treatment in this disease ; though the example of Civiale might, in some cases, be advantageously fol- lowed, who removed a small gi’owth seated at the neck of the bladder by seizing and twisting it off with a lithotrite. Warner has recorded a case in -which a tumour of this kind, of the size of an egg, was tied in the bladder of a woman after dilating her urethra. Billroth has, however, recently successfully removed a -villous gi’owth from the bladder of a boy by performing suprapubic and median lithotomy at the same time, and guiding a knife passed in through the perineal wound Avith his finger inserted at the suprapubic opening. > Cysts of the Bladder have already been mentioned at pp. 759, 765, and 844, in connexion -\Aith stone in and with irritability of that organ. We have now to consider them as a separate disease. As such they may be single or multiple, small in size, not larger than a cherry, or attaining the magnitude of the foetal head, and even larger than this. They no doubt commonly occur in the bladders of elderly men who have suffered from severe mechanical obstacles to the passage of the urine, in the shape of strictiue or enlarged prostate, are associated -with a generally thickened fasciculated state of the organ, and appear to be the result of simple dilatation of some weakened spot in the periphery of the bladder by the compression of the contained mine during efforts at expulsion, causing extrusion of the mucous, of the thinned muscular, and of the expanded serous coats at some points of least resistance. But there is another kind of bladder-cyst, the origin of which cannot be explained in this way, and that would appear to be a distinct out-growth of the bladder. These cysts may be single or multiple, and may attain an enor- mous magnitude. The largest I have seen occurred in a man 35 years of age, otherwise perfectly healthy. He Avas admitted into University College Hospital, and Avas under the joint care of Dr. Wilson Fox and the author. There Avas a tense clastic tumour, smooth and rounded, occupying the Avhole abdomen and extending into the pelvis, so as to be felt through the rectum. Had it occurred in a Avoman, the disease Avould probably have been pronounced ovarian. The tumoAu- had existed for six months, had gradually increased, but occasioned no uneasiness except by its pressm’e-effects. There was and had been no difficulty in passing urine or in defecation. The tumour was aspirated at its most prominent part, and se\en pints of clear lu’ine Avere draAvn off. The patient suddenly became taint, and died of syncope. On examination after death, tAvo enormous cysts Avere found connected with the bladder, one on each side, by a rounded openingS50 DISEASES OF THE EL A DDES. bladder, it may be the result of congestion of the mucous mcmbianc, 0 that would admit the little finger. These orifices were situated symmetrically equidistant from the mesial line, and about one and a half inch above each ureter. These cysts were thin-Avallcd, chiefly composed of mucous membrane and peritoneum, possibly having expanded muscular fibres in their composi- tion. The two cysts Averc emptied through the bladder by the one puncture. The- peh'is of the kidneys, the ureter, and the bladder Avere all dilated; the urethra and prostate quite healthy. There Avas a total absence of all mechanical obstruction. It looked as if the Avhole of the urinary apparatus betAveen the calyces of the kidneys and the neck of the bladder had taken on a dilating out- groAvth. For certainly the dilatation of the canals and the formation of the cysts could not be occasioned by exccntric pressure, due to mechanical obstruction. ILiiiMATimiA.—The admixture of blood Avith the urine may usually be recognised by the colour that it communicates to this fluid. If the blood be in large quantity, the urine AAnll be dark broAvn, chocolate, or morone-coloured, and Avill stain red the bottom of the utensil or a piece of Avhite blotting-paper. If it be in smaller quantity, the urine will be broAvn in varying shades— smoky, or having something the aspect of thin beef-tea ; and in other cases it Avill be little discoloured, but will deposit a red or broAAn sediment on standing. Under the microscope, blood-discs may be detected in large numbers. Heat coagulates the blood into a brownish-grey deposit, leaving a clear supernatant fluid. Htematiuia may arise from a constihdmial condition or from a local cause. When constitutional, it is usually the consequence of scurvy. In those cases it Avill necessarily be associated Avith other, and probably marked, evidences of the disease. A form of haematuria, depending on the presence of a parasite— the Billiarzia lumiatoUa—is prevalent in Africa, and has been ably investi- gated by Leuckart, John Harley, Cobbold, and others. ■\^TAen arising from local causes, hasmaturia is a symptom of disease existing in some part of the urinary apparatus ; but it often assumes so great an importance from the loss of blood induced, that it must be looked upon as a substantive disease. Sources.—Htematuria may arise from, 1, the Kidneys ; 2, the Bladder ; 3, the Prostate ; or 4, the Urethra ; and from each source several distinct causes AAill produce it. The recognition of the precise morbid condition that gives rise to hgematuna is of the first importance in its treatment. 1. H£emorrh.age from the Kidneys.—When occurring fi’om the kidneys, the bleeding may be the result of congestion, acute inflammation, or malignant disease of those organs, of acute, tubercular, or calculous pyelitis, or of passage of a calculus down the ureter. The most certain evidence that the blood comes fr’om the kidney is the presence of blood-casts of the renal tubules. The renal congestion may be inflammatory or passive ; in either case the m-ine will present, after the discharge of blood has ceased, evidences of chronic renal disease in the form of albumen, pus, or casts of tubes. hen the hamion-hage arises from renal calculus, either stationaiy or descending, the symptoms of that morbid condition, described in p. 7o7, vol. II., aviU be Avei Hemorrhage ft-om the Bladder.-If the Mood proceed from theTREATMENT OF UjEMATURIA. 851 in-itation of a calculus, of villous disease, or of the ulceration of malig-nant disease. When it depends on vesical congestion, there will be a sensation of wei<^ht in the region of the bladder, with frequent desire to pass urine ; when on calculus, the special symptoms of the existence of stone will be present. When it occurs from villous disease of the neck of the bladder, the quantity of blood lost is usually very great and the hicmon-hage is persistent. The blood will bo found uniformly mixed with the urine. If it arise fr’om malignant disease, the diseharge of pus, and of the delris of the idcer ating tumour, will afford unequivocal evidences of the true source of thi hiemon-hage. 3 Hseniorrliag'e from tlie Prostat©.—If tho prostate be the source 01 hicmon-hage, the discharge may be occasioned by congestion of that organ, or by its ulceration, simple or malignant. In these cases, exploration by the rectum and lu’ethra will indicate the true cause of the bleeding. In general, when the hajmaturia is renal, the urine will be uniformly mixed with the blood ; when it is prostatic or vesical, the first mine that passes, or that is drawn off by the catheter, will be pale and less bloody than the last, and at the termination of the flow nothing but blood may escape. 4. Hemorrhage from the Urethra.—The bleeding may arise from simple congestion of the mucous membrane, from inflammatory irritation of it, or may follow rupture of the walls of the canal, consequent on injury or on the introduction of instruments. Blood fr-om the lu’ethra usually flows independently of micturition, as in recent injuries, or passes with the first few drops of urine. It may, however, occasionally come with the last drops expelled. This is by no means uncommon in gonon-hcea, or in cases of gleet dependent upon a granular condition of the mucous membrane of the bulbous portion of the nrethra. It seems, then, to be due to the contraction of the ejaculator urinae squeezing a drop or two of blood fr’om the inflamed spot. Treatment.—The treatment of hmmaturia must necessarily have reference to its cause. When it depends on a morbid constitutional state, as scurvy or malarial poisoning, the treatment of the disease, of which the hmmaturia is merely a symptom or an effect, must be conducted on ordinary medical prin- ciples. If it arise from inflammatoiy congestion of the kidneys, bladder, or prostate, cupping, or the application of leeches over the affected part, demul- cents, and saline drinks, will be most efficacious ; if from passive congestion, it will usually be found that the hepatic portal system is at fault, and a dose or two of blue-pill or calomel, follow^ed by a purgative, and afterwards by the use of astringents, AviU speedily induce a cessation of the haemorrhage. The astringent that exercises the most marked influence in arresting haematuria, Avhen that condition is purely passive, is undoubtedly gallic acid. This may be given in five or ten gvain doses, frequently repeated, in infusion of buchu or nva ursi. As a general rale, it is better not to use the catheter in these cases ; but sometimes the bladder becomes distended by a large soft coagulum, filling up its interior, and causing it to reach to the umbilicus, forming a rounded solid tumour, like a gravid uterus. In such circumstances, the fluid contents may be draAvn off by a large catheter, and the more solid portions broken 3 I 2DISEASES OF THE BLADDER. 852 down and washed away by the injection of tepid Avater through a large-eyed or double-current catheter. If the syi-inge of an aspirator be adapted to a large-eyed catheter, the blood, even when coagulated into a single large clot filling the whole bladder, may be easily removed. By the use of this simple contrivance, a complication formerly most troublesome to the Surgeon and most agonising to the patient is overcome without the slightest difficulty. If decomposition occur in the coagulum, giving rise to the formation of flatus in the bladder, a weak tepid saline solution, to which a little creasote has been added, may advantageously be used. I have knoAvn abundant hajmaturia to continue for many years—for twelve or fourteen—probably from villous disease, without deranging the general health to so great an extent as might be expected from so continuous and copious a loss of blood. ATONY OF THE BLADDER. Atony of the Bladder may occur with the opposite conditions of retention and incontinence of urine, according as there is associated mechanical impe- diment or the neck of the organ retains or has lost its contractile power. When the body of the bladder is atonic, whilst the neck preserves its con- tractility, retention of urine wiU ensue in consequence of simple inabihty on the part of the organ to expel its contents, and not from the existence of any mechanical obstacle to the outward flow of the mine. When, on the other hand, the neck of the bladder is paralysed, the urine cannot be retained, but di’ibbles away involuntarily, thus constituting incontinence (p. 855). Atony of the bladder occasionally occurs as the result of a single prolonged over- distension, whether voluntary or involuntary. Atony of the bladder appears in many cases to depend on simple loss of muscular contractility, and to be altogether unconnected with any diminution of nei’A^ous power. The true pathology of this condition has stiU to be made out. May it not, like the analogous atony of the heart, be due to fatty or granular degeneration of the muscular fibres of the affected organ, and the “flabby heart ” have its counterpart in the atonic or “flabby” bladder ? Ebtention of TJuixe.—Loss of tone in the body of the bladder, leading eventually to its atony, not unfrequently ocems in old age as the result of simple diminution of muscular power. It must not be confounded with Paralysis of the bladder as the result of injury or disease of the spinal cord. 1 . T Symptoms.—When this condition comes on slowly as the result ot disease, the patient usually finds that the urine escapes in a dribbling manner ; that there is some difficulty, and at last an impossibihty, in emptying the bladder com- pletely ; and there is not that forcible ejection of the last drops of urine that is characteristic of a healthy tone in the organ ; at the same time, there is not unfr-equently a tendency to the dribbling away of a few drops toivards the end of the emission of urine, and after its apparent cessation. There is also an occa- sional escape of m-ine at night. When complete retention occurs, whether this take place gradually or suddenly, the bladder slowly enlarges, rising at last out of the pelvis into the abdomen, stretching up into the hypogastric rcgio”. reaching even as high as the umbilicus. On examining the lower part ot theRESULTS OF RETENTION FROM ATONY OF BLADDER. 853 abdomen, the organ will be felt hard, elastic, rounded, and pyiifoim in shape, projectiiif^ above the pnbes, and feeling much like an enlarged uterns. In this situation,” also, percussion will elicit a dull sound; and on exploring the part through the rectum, the bladder will be found to project in this direction also ; and on tapping with the fingers above the pubes, fluctuation may be felt through the wall of the gut. Atony of the bladder is a sufficient cause for incomplete retention of urine. But it does not appear to me to be adequate to explain the complete retention with distension of the bladder that is commonly seen. For this to occur there must be some mechanical obstacle, however slight, to the outward flow of the urine—contraction of the neck, or a congested or enlarged prostate. Could complete retention occur from a merely atonic bladder, we should meet with it in women as well as in men. But simple atony of the bladder is a cause of incontinence, not of complete retention, in the female. It is the mechanical obstacle at the neck of the male bladder which intensifies the effects of its atony and leads to the complete stoppage. After the bladder has once become distended, it commonly happens that a quantity of urine continues to dribble out of it; in fact, the amount that escapes in this manner may be very considerable, though the retention continue um'eheved. This retention tvith drihlling is a condition of much practical importance, as the continued escape of mine may lead the patient, and even the Surgeon, to overlook the true nature of the disease ; the more so, as in elderly people retention slowly induced often occasions but httle inconvenience. I have di-awn off nearly a gallon of mine from a patient in whom it had not been saspected that retention existed, in consequence of the continuance of this dribbling. In women, retention is not by any means so common as in men, but the bladder will sometimes attain an enormous size, rising as high as the umbilicus ; and such large bladders have been tapped under the supposi- tion of the tumour being an ovarian cyst, or some similar growth. I once witnessed such a case in which the Smgeon, to his surprise, on tapping the tumour, drew off a quantity of clear and healthy urine, instead of ovarian fluid; fortunately no bad effects followed. This retention with dribbling occurs in consequence of the bladder, as it rises out of the pelvis, elongating its neck ; and as the body becomes bent forward over the pubes a shaiq) curve or angle is formed at the junction of the neck and body of the viscus, through which a small body of urine continues to dribble away, and escapes rather by its own gravity than by any expulsive effort on the part of the patient. Diagnos'is.—Retention from Atony can easily be diagnosed from retention from Ohstruction. In the former, on introducing the catheter when the patient is lying on his back, the instrument will not only readily enter, but the urine will simply flow out in a slow uniform stream, not being projected in a jet by the contrac- tion of the walls of the organ, but rising and falling in obedience to the respiratory movements. In retention from obstruction, there will be expe- lienced some difficulty in passing the instrument at some one point; and when once it is introduced into the bladder, the mine will escape in a free and far projected stream. Results. The habitual retention of a small quantity of urine in an atom'cS54 DISEASES OF THE BLADDER. bladder whicb is incapable of discharging- completely the whole of its contents occurs much more li-equently than is suspected. The quantity thus retained will vary from an ounce to half a pint : the patient believing that he has emptied his bladder, but the introduction of a catheter proving the existence of retained urine. This condition will be a soui-ce of serious inconvenience, and eventually of disease, to the patient. In consequence of the bladder never being completely emptied, there mil be frequent, sudden, and almost u-resistible calls to pass urine, so as to simulate imtability of the bladder. The retained lu’ine becomes offensive, ammoniacal or fishy in odour, and mixed with mucus or muco-pus. The constituents of the urine become absorbed, derange the health, give rise to impaired nutrition, and, being ehminated by the skin, iiiitate it and occasion intractable forms of skin-disease. I have seen chronic eczema of the most inveterate character produced in this Avay, and only yield to treatment on care being taken to keep the bladder clear and free from residual urine. The continuance of complete retention of m-ine from atony of the bladder, will probably give rise to fatal consequences ; a subacute inflammation taking place in the mucous membrane of the organ, which falls into a sloughy condition, accompanied by symptoms of a tyjDhoid type. In some instances coma supervenes, owing to the poisoning of the system by the absorption of the lU’inary constituents. Even though the retention be relieved, tliis condition is apt to come on ; vesical catarrh with fetid m-ine supervening, the tongue becoming brown, and low fever setting in. The bladder cannot ulcerate or bm-st when the retention arises from atony of that organ independent of any mechanical obstacle ; the continued dribbling pre- venting this catastroj)he. Treatment.—The treatment of retention fr-om atony must have reference to the cause of the loss of power in the bladder ; but in all cfrcumstances the m-ine must be drawn off regularly. A large gum catheter must accordingly be introduced twice a day, even though the retention be not complete, in order to empty the bladder of the small quantity of residual m-ine left in it after the apparent evacuation of its contents ; and, in doing this, care must be taken that the beak of the instrument properly enters the body of the bladder, which is further removed from the pubes than usual; for it will sometimes happen that it may enter the dilated prostatic part of the urethra, or elongated neck of the bladder, when, an ounce or two of mine escaping, it may be supposed that there is no more left, though in reality the xiscus is immensely distended. In order to get the catheter well in, its point should be closely hooked around the pubes and raised by depressing the handle between the thighs. In cases ot paralysis, the catheter should neither be introduced too fr-equently, nor should it be allowed to remain in the bladder. Frequent introduction of the instru- ment, or its retention in the bladder, is liable to be followed by subacute cystitis, with fetid, ammoniacal, and viscid m-ine. These sequences are usually attributed to the mechanical in-itation produced by the instrument giving rise to low inflammation of the vesical mucous mem- brane, and this occasioning in its turn a decomposition of the urine. That a solid and foreign body like a catheter may, by its repeated introduction into and retention in the bladder, develop irritative inflammation of the inteiior of this organ, is by no means improbable. But I cannot consider this to be855 INCONTINENCE OF URINE. the sole, or, indeed, the chief cause of the urinary disturbance that ensues. It M-ould appear probable that the air which is carried into the bladder at each introduction of the empty catheter,, gives rise to decomposition of the urine ; that this becoming ammoniacal, decomposed, and fetid, imtates the mucous membrane of the bladder ; that vesical catarrh then results ; and that thus we have the phenomena of decomposed urine, subacute cystitis, and vesical catandi, occurring in the consecutive order just given, and primarily arising from and dependent on the introduction of air, and consequent putrefaction of the urine. The pressure of the point of a catlieter retained in a paralysed bladder may also give rise to sloughing of the mucous membrane. When once a bladder has become atonic, it very rarely recovers its con- tractility completely. The regular use of the catheter becomes imperative, and will do more, by taking off the habit of retention, to favour normal con- tractility, than any medicines. The only internal remedy of any real value is strychnine, in very minute doses, long continued. The treatment of an enormously distended bladder with concmi’ing extra- vasation into, and abscess of, the perinmum, is very simple. It consists in putting the patient in the lithotomy position, introducing the left forefinger ' into the rectum, thrusting a long bistoury, edge upwards, into the mid-line of the perina3iun, until it reaches the open space occupied by pus and urine, cutting upwards for about three inches, and thus opening up the perineal suppuration and extravasation, and evacuating the over-distended bladder through the incision thus made. The double pathological condition is thus relieved by one simple fr’ee incision. After the operation, an elastic catheter may be passed by the luethra into the bladder, the end left open, attached to an India- rubber tube, and the mine thus allowed to escape. IxcoxTiXEXCE OE UErxE ai’ises from weakness of the neck of the bladder, in consequence of which there is not sufficient power to hold the contents of the organ, and the mine escapes. It may be regarded as active or passive, according as the body of the bladder retains or has lost its contractile power. Active Incontinence is most frequent in children, in whom it ocem’s dming sleep, the patient losing command over the sphincter so soon as a small quantity of urine has accumulated behind it. In many cases it is sympathetic, dependent on the irritation of piles, strictme of the methra, or stone in the bladder ; and occasionally it results from nervous causes, more particulai'ly in women of a hysterical temperament. In strumous children, nocturnal incontinence of urine is very apt to occur ; probably from the irri- tation produced by the fluid, which is generally found loaded with uric acid crystals. Passive Incontinence, or, as it has been termed by Thompson, overfloiv of urine, ocems when the bladder is in a state of atony. In such cases, the sphincter-like action of the neck may not be quite lost, so that a small quantity of urine is ejected from time to time, as it overcomes the slight resistance offered by the partial contractility of the neck. Over-distension of the bladder will occasion incontinence of urine, not from paralysis, but fr-om a kind of strain of the muscular structures of the part : in this way a patient, who from circumstances has been unable to empty his bladder for a con- siderable time, may suffer from incontinence. Incontinence or ovcrfloAv is8s 6 DISEASES OF THE BLADDER. also liable to occur iu cases of enlarged prostate ; being here preceded by- distension (see page 8(;4). In old people it may occur from simple debility, and is commonly associated -witli a tendency to retention. li cntmcnt, fhe treatment must depend upon the cause. TVhen the incon- tinence occuis in weakly childi’cn, if it be not connected with worms or gastro- intestinal irritation, which should then be removed, the administration of tonics will be found useful—either quinine or the tincture of sesquichloride of iron, alone or conjoined with tincture of cantharides. If there be irritation of the mucous membrane of the bladder, the administration of alkalies, in conjunction with a tonic, as the potassio-tartrate of iron, or a little copaiba mixed with honey, will be found very serviceable. Cold sponging, light clothing at night, and means calculated to break the habit, such as waking the child at the time at which it generally occurs, changing his position in bed, &c., should not be omitted. Of all remedies for incontinence of urine in children, belladonna is the most successful. Einger advises it to be given in full doses ; from 10 to ' 20 minims of the tincture three times a day. When incontinence ocem’s at a more advanced period of life, if there be any source of sympathetic irritation, this must be removed : if none can be discovered, recourse' must be had to ' tonics, especially iron and cantharides -with strychnine, and galvanism, together Avith cold douching or shower-baths, and in old people the daily use of the catheter. j Hysterical Hetention and Incontinence of Urine not unfi’equently ' occur in nervous girls, and require to be treated by antihysterical remedies, amongst Avhich preparations of sesquichloride of iron, either alone or with valerian, -null be found most useful. Cold douches are also of great service. In cases of hysterical retention, it may sometimes be necessary to use the catheter ; but in such circumstances it is well not to employ this instrument |: too fi’equen-tly, as the patients are apt to get into the habit of having it intro- ; duced, and wiU, with that morbid propensity that characterises hysteria, con- ; tinue for a length of time to require its introduction. If left to themselves, though the bladder may become much distended, it will not bui’st, but will probably empty itself without fru’ther trouble, particularly if the patient be put. into a tub and well douched over the hip and loins with cold water. In some cases, these morbid conditions in women appear to be connected with some local irritation about the m’ethra or uterus ; and then proper treatment must be directed to these organs before the disease can be removed. Painful Conditions of the Bladder.—The bladder may be the seat of severe pain, either continuous or remittent, without any disease being dis- cernible iu it on the closest examination ; the pain being either a kind of nem-algic condition, especially occurring in hysterical or hypochondriacal , patients ; or else being sympathetic with, and dependent on, disease at a ; distance, as in the kidneys, uterus, rectum, &c. At the same time it must be borne in mind, that the secretion of acid or irritating urine aauII, in some V individuals, be a source of much and constant suffering ; and that any disease i, seated about, or coming into contact with, the neck of the bladder, as tumour, | stone, &c., is especially apt to give rise to severe suffering, and will, in mam cases, be accompanied by ft'equeut desire to mictiHate, with much spasm about the part.857 FRO STATIC ABSCESS. CHAPTER LXXI. —♦ DISEASES OF THE PROSTATE. The prostate is subject to Acute and Chronic Inflammation, to Hypertrophy, and occasionally to Atrophy, Malignant Disease, Tubercle, and the formation of Calcuh. PKOSTATITIS. Acute Iiifiamination of the Prostate, or Prostatitis, reiy rarely occurs as an idiopathic affection. When met with, it is usually the result of . gonon’hoea. Or of the use of strictiu'e-instruments, more especially in middle- aged men. Symptoms.—These are—deeply-seated duU pain, with heat and weight in the perinaeum, a frequent desire to pass urine, and very great and spasmodic pain accompanying the act; in fact, the irritabihty that is set up about the neck of the bladder is perhaps the most marked and distressing feature in the disease. These symptoms are, however, common to various inflammatory affections of the m’inary organs, and they can only be distinctly referred to the inflamed prostate by rectal exploration. On introducing the finger into the gut, the prostate wiU be found much enlarged and exquisitely tender to the touch ; and the patient often suffers considerably from the pressure of the inflamed organ upon the rectum during defecation. Treatment.—This should be of an active antiphlogistic character, so as to prevent, if possible, the formation of abscess. The perinseum must be cupped or weU leeched ; warm hip-baths and poppy fomentations assiduously employed ; and sahnes with antimony administered. In this "way, the for- mation of abscess within or aroimd the prostate mav, in many cases, be prevented. Prostatic Abscess may happen either as a consequence of acute inflam- mation running into the suppurative stage, and in this way it is not very unfrequently met with as a complication of gonorrhoea ; or it may occim with comparatively little antecedent inflammation—as sometimes happens in pyaemia, or if the organ be accidentally bruised during lithotrity. In these cases, abscess perhaps as frequently forms in the areolar envelope as in the organ itself. Idiopathic suppuration of the prostate, irrespective of any of the above causes, is, however, of rare occiUTence ; but it may occur in individuals of broken health, the matter then usually accumulating in large quantity, and discharging itself into the bladder. Symptoms. When inflammation of the prostate terminates in abscess, rigors.858 DISEASES OF THE PROSTATE. with stranguiy, and perhaps retention of urine, occur. In many ca.ses the perinmnm becomes brawny ; in others, tenderness of the gland and deep fluctuation may be felt throng] 1 the rectum. When left to itself, the abscess most usually gives way into the urethi-a or nock of the bladder ; jjut it may, especially when occurring in the prostatic capsule, open externally into the perinmum, or even into the rectum. In many cases, the abscess presenting on the urethral surface of the prostate is burst diu-ing the introduction of the catheter, used for the relief of the retention of urine induced by the pressure of the tumefaction ; the matter escaping along the side of and through the instrument. Treatment.—It not unfrequently happens that the first certain indication afforded to the Siu’geon of the foi’mation of a prostatic abscess is the escape of pus by the urethra, or mixed with the mine, so as to give this fluid a thick milky appearance. In such circumstances, the only available treatment is that which is directed for the relief of the strangiuy and local vesical irritation on ordinary medical principles, such as have aheady been described. But if, as sometimes happens, the pus come forward into the perinmum, then a more decided line of treatment is required. In these cases a hard brawny mass will be felt lying deeply on the side of the perinaeum ; and into this a deep incision should be made. The Surgeon must not wait for fluctuation, but must cut deeply in the direction of the matter, keeping, however, as nearly as possible in the mesial line, with the back of the knife towards the rectum. Even if no pus escape at first, it may do so if the part be well poulticed for a few hom's ; and thus communication with the m’ethra or rectum may be prevented. Bietention of Urine from Prostatitis.—In prostatitis, retention may occur from the swelling of the organ, from the infiltration of exudation-matter around it, or from the formation of pus in it. In these cases the neck of the bladder will be carried to a considerable distance from the siuface, and may very probably not be reached by an ordinary catheter, which may be biu’ied up to the rings and yet not enter the cavity of that organ. In these circumstances a silver prostate-catheter should be employed; and this must be carefully introduced, lest, by entering the cavity of an abscess which has already biust ]3er urethram, it might be supposed to have entered the bladder itself. In introducing the instrument in these circumstances, care should be taken to keep its point constantly in contact with the upper sm’face of the urethra, and to hook it round the pubes. The iipper smfface of the urethra is a sm’e guide to the bladder ; for any abscess, false passage, or irregularity of direction will always first affect the lower aspect of this canal, being siurounded by yielding structiu'es; whilst the upper part, being firmly supported by bone and liga- ment, cannot so readily alter its direction. Deep-Seated and very Chronic Abscess will sometimes slowly form in the pelvis, between the bladder and rectum, or behind the prostate, giving rise ^ by its pressm-e to a long train of obscure symptoms, indicative of irritation about these organs, such as dysiu'ia, strangury, occasional admixture of pus with the urine. On careful examination of the perina3um and rectum, some slight hardness may perhaps be deeply felt in the mesial line, or towards one side of it. This slowly increases, and perineal abscess of an ill-defined chai’acter devclopes itself. When this has become sufficiently evident, a free incisionCHRONIC ENLARGEMENT OF THE PROSTATE. 859 should be made into it, when pus in gi’eater or less abundance will escape. On careful exploration by a probe of the cavity thus opened up, a deep sinus will probably be found leading into the pelvis, and to the original seat of the abscess. This requires to be opened up by a free incision on one side or other of the perina3um, as if for lateral lithotomy, and a proper and direct exit given to the matter. The cavity must then be dressed with dry lint, and allowed to granulate from the bottom. CHRONIC ENIiARGEMENT OP THE PROSTATE. Clironic Enlargement of the Prostate may be looked upon as a senile disease, seldom occiu-ring before the age of fifty-five, and being commonly met with after this. At that period of life, as Brodie observes, when the hair becomes grey and scanty, when atheroma begins to be deposited in the coats of the arteries, and when the arcus senilis forms on the cornea, the prostate often becomes increased in size. At the same time, however, other changes take place in the genito-urinary system ; thus the urethi’a becomes dilated and the bladder thickened ; and, unless the enlargement of the prostate advance in too gi'eat a proportion to the other changes, so as to interfere with the free escape of the m-ine, no disease can properly be said to be established. If we look upon the diseased enlargement of the prostate as such an amount of hyper- trophy of this organ as interferes seriously with the discharge of the mine, we shall probably not find it so frequent even in old men as is generally supposed. Guthrie states that it is not commonly found in the pensioners at Greenwich Hospital. Thompson found that an enlargement appreciable after death existed in 34 per cent, of men above the age of sixty ; but that such a degree of enlargement as to give rise to symptoms dming life Avas only met with in 15 or IG per cent, of the cases he examined. Though age must be looked upon as the primary cause of this particular hypertrophy of the prostate, there can be little doubt that it may be predisposed to by any continued source of irritation of the minary organs, such as gonorrhoea, stricture, or hard living. Characters.—Enlargement of the prostate is due to hypertrophy of the normal structures—fibrous and glandular—of the organs. Most commonly there is an excess of development of the fibrous structure ; generally, how- ever, when the size of the gland has been very slowly and not greatly enlarged, there is nearly equal hypertrophy of all the tissues. In rare instances, there is excessive development of tlie glandular element ; and in some cases homologous tuinom's are developed. The enlargement generally occupies the whole of the organ, and may cause its size to increase to that of a hen’s egg or a small orange ; in most cases, all the lobes are enlarged equally or nearly so, but sometimes there is a greater development of one of the lateral lobes or of the middle portion. More rarely, the lateral lobes or the anterior commissure alone are enlarged. The enlarged prostate, in the earlier stages, presents to the naked eye an ap- pearance of rotundity and increased fulness : at a more advanced stage, there may be great irregularity of outline. There is usually no change of coloiu,’ externally : and the texture of the gland is generally indurated, though some- times it is found to be looser and softer than natiu-al. On making a section,DISEASES OF THE PROSTATE. 86o the cut surface bulges above the level; and the shades of colour are more strongly marked than in the healthy prostate. Not uncommonly, single gland- lobules are found hypertrophied; and in some cases, spheroidal prominences are seen, which are easily enucleated, and which arc tumours formed in the substance of the gland. Of these we shall presently speak. In some instances, an abundance of fluid escapes from the cut siu’face and from the openings of the prostatic ducts ; while in other cases this is entirely wanting. Small cavities, dilatations of the gland-follicles, are occasionally found; sometimes empty, and sometimes containing a yellow fluid resembling pus in appearance, but which consists of the prostatic secretion in a thickened state. The prostate may attain a very large size. The largest that I have seen is certainly one in the Norwich Hospital Museum, taken from a man of eighty ; it weighs more than 20 ounces. Simple Prostatic Tumours.—The nature of simple tumours of the prostate has been carefully studied by Sir Henry Thompson ; to whose elaborate work on the diseases of this organ the student is referred for further information. According to Thompson, tumoiu’s of non-malignant character are met with in most cases of hypertrophied prostate, and also occasionally when there is no eidargement of the organ. He divides them into two classes. “ 1. Tumours which are generally imbedded in the substances of the pro- state, but the structures of which are isolated from those which surrounded it. “ 2. Outgrowths which are continuous in structure with the parts of the prostate whence they spring, but which manifest a tendency to become par- tially isolated, by assuming a more or less polypoid form, and maintaining attachment to the parent organ through the medium of a pedicle only.” 1. The isolated tumours\i\ the substance of the prostate have been recog-nised by Sir E. Home, Cruveilhier, Eokitansky, Paget, and other pathologists. They may occupy any portion of the organ ; but are, perhaps, more numerous in the lateral lobes than elsewhere. They are easily enucleated, having but a loose connection with the substance of the gland. In diameter they vary from ^'^th to f ths of an inch. They are firmer and mostly paler in coloiu than the proper prostatic tissue, and are less vascular. “ The basis of the tumoius appears to be the fibrous basis or stroma of the prostate itself, an admixtiue of unstriped, soft, pale muscular fibres, and con- nective mth a little elastic tissue, closely interwoven. Interspersed vrith this, there are present in most cases small cavities containing flattened polygonal or spheroidal epithelium, like that seen in a pouch at the extremity of a prostatic gland-duct, and sometimes, also, some prismatic epithelium. These cavities ai-e sometimes solitary, sometimes slightly branched, and sometimes of an elongated or tubular form. In a few instances there is very little, or, perhaps no such glandular tissue to be found ; generally, however, a careful search will discover it. In some of the outlying tumours the glandular structure is more perfectly developed—in some it is quite so—and a duct is furnished which evidently caiTies secretion to the appointed destination.” 2. The part of the prostate which is most usually the seat of outgrowth is the middle or luethral portion, which may become greatly enlarged in size, with or without hypertrophy of the lateral lobes. The growth assimies a pyrifoimMECHANICAL EFFECTS OF ENLARGED PROSTATE. 86i shape, and is more or less pedunculated. It is continuous in structure with the prostatic tissues, and has its own duct, which opens into the urethra through the pedicle. Prostatic concretions are commonly found in these out- growths ; never in the isolated tumours. OutoTOwths ai’o most common in the middle portion of the prostate ; but sometimes there may be a projection from the posterior part of one of the lateral lobes, or from that portion of the gland Avhich lies above or in fr-ont of the inner orifice of the urethra. In rare instances, the A'crumontanum alone appears to be affected, forming •a thickened polypoid projection, which projects in a valvular manner, and interferes materially with the floAV of lu-ine. Thompson points out, as had been suggested by Velpeau, that remarkable analogies exist between these prostatic outgrowths and the fibroid tumours of the uterus. This view is in accordance with the teaching of Leuckart, Simpson, and others, that the prostatic utricle in the male is the analogue of the uterus in the female. Mechanical Effects of Enlarged Prostate on the Urinary Organs.— Enlargements of the prostate are productive of inconvenience vith regard to the flow of urine, giving rise either to retention or to incontinence, or to a kind of mixture of both conditions. VTien the lateral lobes are enlarged, there is a diminution of the lateral or transverse diameter of the canal, at the same time that the antero-posterior diameter is increased, so that the canal becomes a chink-like passage. The m-ethi’a also becomes greatly elongated and tortuous; and is diverted from the natiu'al direction—this varying with the form of enlargement. When the median portion is enlarged, there is a more or less ■angular curvatme of the canal at the prostatic portion. When, in addition, there is enlargement of a lateral lobe, the urethra is also curved laterally in the direction of the enlarged lobe. The lateral deviation may occur also when there is enlargement of the middle lobe ; but it then affects both sides. The inner orifice of the urethra also uudergoes changes. Enlargement of the posterior part of the middle portion of the prostate gives it a crescentric form, ■with the uonvexity directed upwards : and, in enlarge- ment of either lateral lobe, the convexity of the crescent lies towards the side opposite the enlarged lobe. Sometimes, when there are two •or more irregularly enlarged lobes, the orifice is very much distorted, elongated, and tortuous. Sometimes, in cases of valvular or pedunculated projections from the posterior portions, the orifice appears to be overlapped altogether. This condition existed in the case from which the accompanying (Fig. 790) Avas taken ; the third, or median lobe forming a pedunculated tumour Avhich aeted like a A^alve—obstrueting the exit of the urine from the bladder, though it did not offer any obstacle to the introduction ■of a catheter. Fig. 700.—niacUler laid oiicii, slio^vving Enlargcnieut of Urctliral Fortiou of Prostate.862 DISEASES OF THE F HOST ATE. _ Ihe elongation and expansion of the prostatic portion of the urethra gives rise to an increase in its capacity, so that it sometimes holds two or three ounces of urine ; and the elongation will caiTy the neck of the bladder upwards and behind the pubes, to a considerable dis- tance from the urethra. AVhile the lateral enlargements cause the urethra to assume a somewhat tor- tuous course, the middle lobe, if hypertro- phied, may readily occasion retention, by projecting against the entrance to this winding channel, and falling over it like a valve whenever the patient attempts to pass mine, as in Fig. 790. Then, again, if the middle lobe continue small whilst the enlargement of the lateral lobes takes a direction up towards the bladder, widen- ing as they go, the vesical neck may be sa dilated that incontinence and a continuous dribbling will occur through a kind of fis- sure that extends between the lateral lobes. The obstacle ofiered to the passage- of the urine by an enlarged prostate wiU usually eventually give rise to a chroni- cally thickened, fasciculated, and sacculated bladder, the fundus of which descends dilated; ciironiti below and behind the enlarged gland, fonning a kind of pouch that cannot empty itself, and in which mucus and morbid concretions are apt to collect. The ureters often become dilated and the kidneys chronically diseased; a series of changes well illustrated by the annexed cut (Fig. 791). Moral Effects of Enlarged Prostate.—The irritation of a congested and enlarged prostate Avill excite libidinous ideas in the aged, which may lead to the perpetration of acts of indecency—such as exposure of the person, &c., or to a general impairment of the moral tone. But not only does the diseased state of this body thus excite a depraved condition of the mind ; the converse will alsa happen. And if the true history of many cases of prostatic congestion and. hmmorrhage were told, it would be found to begin in imdue or in-egular sexual or erotic excitement, by which the genital organs have been injm-iously Fig. 791.—Besults of enlai-ged Prostate; Bladder enlarged: Ureters Disease OT Kidneys. over-stimulated. SvjVIPTOMS.—The symptoms of enlarged prostate arise primarily from the mechanical obstacle offered to the escape of the urine. The first symptoms usually consist in the feeling of a necessity to strain slightly before the urine will flow; and then, after the bladder has been apparently emptied, in the- involuntary escape of a small quantity of urine. The patient also finds that he is much longer than usual in emptying the bladder ; for, though the stream flows freely enough so soon as it has once begun to escape, yet it cannot be properly projected, the viscus having, to a certain extent, lost its tonicity.DIAGNOSIS OF OBSTRUCTION BY ENLARGED PROSTATE. 863 About this time changes begin to take place in the urine, -which usually becomes someAvhat fetid, even while it continues acid, and is often intermixed with more or less viscid, stringy mucus ; though in many cases it is clear, pale, and not in any way altered in character. The symptoms often come on in a veiy gradual manner, the patient straining and experiencing much difficulty in the extrusion of the urine for months or even years before retention will occur. As the disease advances and the bladder becomes less capable of emptying itself, two or three ounces or more of residual urine are left, which becomes dark, and mixed Avith adhesive sticky mucus ; and, at last, if the mucous membrane of the bladder fall into a chronic state of inflammation, this urine assumes a milky appearance from an admixture of pus, and becomes horriljly offensive, blackening the silver catheter. Diagnosis.—The exact condition of the enlarged prostate can only be ascer- tained by examination through the rectum and lU’cthra. By rectal exploration with the finger, the degree of eiflargement of the lateral lobes can best be ascertained ; though, as in many cases the end of the finger cannot reach the fiu'ther extremity of the gland, it AviU be impossible to say to what extent the hypertrophy has extended. The urethral exploration must be conducted by means of a long gum-elastic or a silver prostatic catheter, and will afibrd information that rectal exploration cannot give ; and by it are ascertained approximately the size of the middle lobe, and the condition of the urethra as to elongation and curve. The diagnosis of obstruction in consequence of enlarged prostate has to be made from that produced by, 1, Stricture of the Urethra ; 2, Calculus of the Bladder ; 3, Vesical Tumour : 4, Chronic Cystitis ; 5, Atony of the Bladder ; G, Paralysis of the Bladder. 1. Ill Stricture the stream of mine is small ; the obstruction is ivithin six inches of the meatus and the disease mostly occurs before middle life. In enlarged prostate, the flow of urine is not always reduced in volume ; the obstruction is at least seven inches from the orifice ; and the enlargement does not occur until after middle hfe. In stricture, straining will increase the jet of urine ; in enlarged prostate, it only makes matters worse. 2. Calculus presents many symptoms in common with enlarged prostate, and its more special symptoms may be absent. The presence of a small quantity of florid blood in the urine passed after exercise should make the SiU’geon strongly suspect the presence of a stone ; but the use of the sound wiU alone lead to an exact diagnosis. _ 3. Vesical Tumour gives rise to more pain and tenderness on the introduc- tion of instruments than prostatic enlargement; and the urine generally con- tains samous discharge and flocculi, often with sabulous matter. Microscopic examination of the contents of the urine may show tlie presence of the com- ponent tissues of the tumour. Tumours, especially of the malignant kind may be felt through the rectum ; while villous tumours give rise to the almost constant presence of blood in the urine. ^ 4. In Chrome Cystitis, without complication, the absence of the physical signs of enlarged prostate, as ascertained by examination by the rectum and urethra, vill establish the diagnosis.864 DISEASES OF THE PROSTATE. T). In Atony of the bladder from over-distension, the diagnosis is effected by observing the manner in which the urine flows on the introduction of a catheter. In prostatic obstruction—provided that the distension have not produced atony—tlie flow of urine is often forcible, and can be accelerated by the will of the patient; while, in atony, the m’ine simply runs out through the catheter. G. True Paralyses of the bladder, accompanied with a similar affection of other parts, is recognised by its concomitant conditions, and by the absence of physical signs of enlarged prostate, and, as in atony, by the passive natm’c of the flow of urine through the catheter, detention of Urine constitutes the great danger in advanced cases of enlarged prostate. It commonly comes on gradually, the patient having for some time before experienced considerable difficulty in passing his urine, and he ■will often find that the more he strains in his efforts to do this the less readily will it come away ; whereas, when he remains quiet, it -will usually flow with more freedom. The retention firom prostatic enlargement is of the mixed kind, there being always more or less incontinence, or rather overflow, conjoined with it. When the bladder has become tense, and the prostatic portion of the urethra put upon the stretch, the escape of a certain quantity of urine will take place, mitil, by the relief of the tension of the over-distended bladder, the parts about its neck and the enlarged prostate become relaxed, so that they again fall together, and thus, the urethra resuming its tortuoiis condition, the outlet is occluded. In these cases error may always be guarded against by the Surgeon feeling the enlarged bladder rising up above the pubes, and reaching perhaps as high as the umbiheus. This condition is an extremely dangerous one, not so much from any risk of the bladder or m-ethra giving way in conse- quence of over-distension, which very rarely happens in retention from enlarged prostate, as from the occmTence of atony of the bladder, or the probability of the early setting in of chronic inflammation of its mucous membrane, which is especially apt to take place. The bladder has usually not emptied itself com- pletely for a considerable length of time before the retention is complete; and a quantity of ropy mucus, having collected in the fundus behind the prostate, whence it cannot be expelled, becomes putrid, and thus disposes to the super- vention of that form of chronic inflammation of the vesical mucous membrane, which, occurring in a depressed state of the system, is especially apt to give rise to a brown tongue 'vuth quick pulse, and typhoid symptoms. Secondary inflammation of the kidneys terminating in suppuration is of fi’equent occur- rence. Indeed, when death ocem’s from prostatic disease, it usually takes place in this way. In some rare instances there is evidence of true incontinence of urine, the bladder being found empty and contracted, while the prostate is enlarged con- siderably but equally, so that the urethral orifice is patent. Treatment.—In the treatment of enlarged prostate, little, cazi be done by ‘ medical means ; though the patient’s condition may be somewhat ameliorated by remedies calculated to lessen irritation about the urinaiy organs, and to improve the condition of the urine. If it be very acid, alkalies with henbane should be given ; if neutral or alkaline, the dilute nitric acid with opium ; it mixed ■with ropy mucus or muco-pus, the infusion of buchu, or the balsams otUSE OF THE CATHETER IN ENLARGED PROSTATE. 865 copaiba or Peru, or turpentine. If hjEmorrhage occur, tincture of sesqui- chloride of iron, infusion of uva ursi, or gallic acid, will be useful. Counter- in-itation, the application of iodine, and other measures calculated to promote absorption of the enlarged gland, are of service. In the treatment of enlarged prostate, it is of great importance to use the catheter regularly, in order to empty the pouch that forms in the l)as fond of the bladder behind the prostate ; and which, being below the level of the urethra, tends to collect an accumulation of viscid mucus and fetid urine which the patient cannot expel without aid, partly from their gravitating into this pouch, and partly from the muscular power of the organ being impaired. The removal of these matters is of great unportance ; as, independently of any retention, they may, by undergoing putrefaction, give rise to septie infection. The bladder should be effectually emptied at least twice everij day. This may best be done by the introduction of a gum catheter of full size, which should be passed without the stylet. This the patient should be taught to do himself; and thus the habitual distension of the bladder, or retention in it of a quantity of urine, will be prevented, and aU the accompanying constitutional distm’bance averted. Sometimes, in order to reach and empty the bladder thoroughly, a prostatic catheter must be used. This instrument should be made of silver, and be of large size, equal to about No. 12. In oi’der to properly enter the bladder, which is carried away from the surface by the elongated urethra, the prostatic should be about four inches longer than an ordinary catheter ; and, as the neck of the viscus is usually pushed up high behind the pubes by the projection upwards of the lateral lobes, the curve of the instrument should be gi’eater and longer than usual. I find the best-shaped prostatic catheter to be one, the curve of which is exactly the third of the circumference of a circle five-and-a-half inches in dia- meter. The eyes should be large and rounded ; and I have found it of use to have the lower end of the stylet pro- vided Avith a piston-plate, so that, by Avithdrawing this, the mucus may be sucked in through the eyes of the instrument. In some cases, however, a moderately curved gum-elastic catheter, of full size, enters the bladder most easily ; in fact no one curve nor one kind of instrument will answer in all cases. In introducino- the catheter, care should be taken Avhen the point enters the prostatic portion of the urethra to depress the handle well between the thighs, lest the end against the enlarged middle lobe (Fig. 792) or do not sweep sufficiently Fig. r92.—Enlarged Middle Lobe of Prostate arresting progress of the Catheter. ’DISEASES OF THE PROSTATE. 866 round the pubes. The middle lobe, even when very greatly enlarged and valvular, as was the case in Fig. 700, docs not necessarily offer much obstacle to the introduction of the catheter, the point of which pushes it hack. It is of great moment to ascertain that the catheter does fairly enter the body of the bladder. In enlarged prostate, the corresponding portion of the urethra is often elongated and dilated, forming a bend or pouch, containing perhaps half an ounce or one ounce of urine; this pouch the catheter may enter and empty, and the Siu-geon, then erroneously supposing that he has passed the instrument into the bladder, may rest content; but this is a grievous error, as the bladder is left distended beyond the pouch. Treatment of Retention of Urine.—^When retention has occurred, re- lief can only be afforded by the proper use of the catheter, and this should never be delayed, as typhoid symptoms in elderly people rapidly set in. Three questions present themselves in connection with the treatment of this form of retention. 1. As to the hind of cathetcT Ah&t should be used, Brodie recommends a gum-elastic instrument, long, of large size, and kept on a well-curved iron stylet, so to preserve its curve when that is withdrawn. This must be intro- duced either with or without the stylet; if possible, without it. Other Surgeons of great authority in these matters prefer the silver prostatic catheter ; and I certainly think that for the relief of retention a silver instrument is safer, and more easily managed, than the gum-elastic one. It might be supposed that a less chance of mischief would result from the gum-elastic than from the metallic catheter, as being the softer and more yielding instrument; but this is erroneous, if the stylet be allowed to remain in, as it is then as rigid at the point, as hard, and as likely to penetrate soft structures as a silver oue would be. If the stylet be withdrawn, it is often a very unmanageable instru- ment ; it is impossible to know how to direct its point; and if the obstacle be difficult to surmount, it is not easy to guide the instrument over it. The manoeuvre mentioned by Sir B. Brodie wiU often be of use ; viz., after passing the catheter as far as it will go, to withdraw the stylet for three or four inches, and so tilt up the point of the catheter, which then passes over the obstacle. With the metallic catheter, on the other hand, the Surgeon can feel his way, as it were, and wiU, if he depress the handle well, as soon as the point enters the prostatic portion of the urethra, find little difficulty in guiding it into the bladder. It is the first introduction of the instrument that especially requhes care, and as much gentleness as possible ; after it has once been introduced, it will almost invariably readily find its own way. It is a question whether the patient should be placed in the erect or in the recumbent position, when the catheter is introduced for the rehef of uriuaiy retention. I certainly think that the recumbent is not only the easiest position in which to introduce the instrument, but the safest. In old and feeble subjects the sudden withdrawal of the urine, by removing compression from the abdo- ‘ minal veins, and allowing these vessels to refiU, may induce syncope, which occurring in the erect position might prove fatal. I have heard of one case, in which the sudden death of the aged patient in such circiunstances was attributed to this cause. By far the most convenient instrument in the majority of cases is the softTREA TMENT 0 F RETENTION FROM ENLARGED FROST A TE 867 French “ elbowed ” catheter—the “ cathetere a coucle,” of the size and shape here represented (Fig. 7i)8). The stem is soft and pliable, but the angle and eyed point are made of firm gum-catheter material. By keeping the point well up against the methra, it ^viU often slip in very easily and smoothly in cases of enlarged prostate. A flexible India-rubber catheter is also a useful instrument in the treatment of prostatic retention. Hutchinson states “that in almost all cases of prostatic xetention, a flexible India-rubber catheter wdthout a stylet can be passed into the bladder.” Its use is so perfectly painless and free from danger, that it may always be tried before adopting more sereie measuies. If from anj cause it be necessary to retain such an instrument, hlutchinson uses a nozzle wdth rings passed into the orifice of the India-rubber catheter, and fitted with a “ styletted plug.” The nozzle is about three-quarters of an inch in length, and is fitted accurately by the plug. The stylet reaches about two inches down the catheter so as to stiffen it. With such an instrument in use, the patient need not be confined to bed. 2. The next question in connection with the rehef of retention in these cases is, whether the catheter should be left in the Uadder, or be tvithdremn after the wiscus is emptied. As a general rule, it is certainly far better not to leaye the catheter in, for the reasons given at page 85-1. The instrument should be introduced twice in the twenty-four hours ; and care should be taken, if possible, to empty the pouch behind the prostate by depressing its point. When the instrument is used habitually in this way, the gum-catheter may be employed. Should the mucus be very viscid and offensive, the bladder may be washed out with tepid water through a double current catheter. After the bladder has been emptied for the first time, it wiU be found to refill in the course of a very few hours, usually in six or eight, the secretion of the kidneys appearing to be set free on the removal of the pressm-e. Should any great diflBculty be experienced in introducing the catheter, it may be thought desirable to leave it in the bladder for two or three days ; and then a gum-elastic one is always to be prefen’ed, as,in these circumstances it presents a great advantage over the silver catheter, becoming soft, accommo- I dating itself to the shape of the parts after the stylet has been taken out, and 1 not being so liable to irritate the mucous membrane wdth its point, w^hich, I dipping down into the pouch behind the prostate, acts as a syphon, emptying t this part of the bladder far better than a silver catheter could do. I 3. The third question in connection with the relief of retention from I enlarged prostate, is as to the course that should bo pursued if no instru- ment can l)e introduced into the Uctdder in the ordinary way. In these cases, which, however, very rarely occur, three lines of practice may be adopted ; puncture of the bladder above the pubes, punciure through the rectum, ox forcible catheterism.868 DISEASES OF THE PROSTATE. Puncture above the Pubes can vci’y seldom be required. Since the University College Hospital was opened, only three cases have presented them- selves in which it was thought proper to adopt such a procedure for retention from enlarged prostate ; and in one of these cases, Avhich was under my care, the enlargement of the prostate was complicated with impermeable stricture, which was, indeed, the main cause of the retention. The operation consists either in pushing the trochar at once through the abdominal wall; or else, as in tapping for ascites, making a small incision about half an inch in length through the integuments, exactly in the mesial line, immediately above the i pubes, and then passing a curved trochar, with its concavity do\vnwards and backwards, into the bladder behind that bone, and consequently underneath the reflection of the peritoneum (Fig. 794). After the bladder has been emptied, the cannula or an elastic gum tube must be left in for the escape of the urine, whilst the continuity of the natural passage is being restored. When the bladder is gTeatly distended, in consequence of retention from enlargement of the prostate or any other cause, the peritoneal reflection is car- ried lip Avith it, and a considerable portion of the anterior wall of the organ i uncovered by peritoneum is left above the pubes. In a case of unrelieved re- j tention from stricture, in which the patient died suddenly during the adminis- tration of chloroform, and which I had an opportunity of dissecting, I found i that the fundus of the bladder reached to five inches above the symphysis i pubis, and was only two inches below the umbiheus ; that the line of reflec- tion of the peritoneum was 3|- inches above the bone ; and that the space uncovered by serous membrane was 2^ inches wide. The bladder contained nearly forty ounces of urine, the | retention having lasted dm’ing forty-eight hours. Brander of Jersey and others have modified this operation by puncturing through the symphysis pubis, by means of a trochar and cannula. There is not, however, sufficient evidence to enable us to decide as to the merits of this procedure. Puncture tlirough the Rec- tum is not generally a safe pro- cedure in retention from enlarged prostate, in consequence of this structure encroaching on that i (Fig. 794).CANCER OF THE PROSTATE. 869 A procedure that was formerly recommended by Brodie, Liston, and most Siu-geons of authority in these matters, was Forcible Cathetensm, or Tun- nelling the Prostate. As the retention is generally owing to an enlai^gement of the urethral portion of the prostate, relief was allbrded by pushing the point of a silver catheter through this obstacle into the bladder. A false passage was thus purposely formed, in Avhich the instrument was left for about forty-eight hours, when it would generally enter it again with sufficient readiness on being re-introduced. This practice has, however,' been very generally rendered uniie- cessaiy by the use of improved instruments, aided by chloroform inhalations ; and “ timnelling the prostate ” may be looked upon as belonging to a past age of Urinary Surgery, ruder than the present. After the retention has been relieved, the bladder will often remain in an atonic state for a time, the mine flowing out, but with no power of expulsion, for some weeks. In these circumstances, the catheter should be used twice in the twenty-four hours ; good diet, with wine, quinine, and extract of nux vomica may be given, and blisters applied to the sacrum ; afterwards, the patient should be taught to pass the catheter for himself once or twice daily. The radical cme of the impediment to the flow of the m’ine has been pro- posed to be efiected by removing the enlarged middle lobe of the prostate by ligature, by excision with a lithotrite, or by lateral or median incision of the perimeum. Such operations, however, from their difficulty and danger, should not be hghtly undertaken ; perhaps the least dangerous mode of removal ivould be by median m’ethrotomy. OTHEB DISEASES OF THE PBOSTATE. Atrophy of the Prostate sometimes ocem’s. It may be the result of exhausting disease, especially phthisis, of old age, of mechanical pressure from tumoms or calculi, or of local disease of the gland itself. The atrophy may also be congenial. Cancer of the Prostate.—The prostate is very rarely attacked by cancer, probably more rarely than any other structure in the body. When cancer occurs in this organ, it is usually of the encephaloid and htematoid forms. I have, however, seen true scirrhus in the case of a man about 70 years old. He died with secondary deposits in the abdominal gland, and -with the liver studded with scuThous nodules. Eare as the disease is, I have seen at least three instanees of it, and can therefore scarcely agi'ce with the estimate of Tanchou, given by Walshe, that it only occurred five times in upw^ai-ds of eight thousand fatal cases of cancer. The SymjJtoms are those of ordinary enlarged prostate. But digital examination y?er rectum wdU probably detect a large, hard, ill-defined mass entering up into the pelvis and abdomen ; and the gradual development of secondary deposits in distant organs wiU reveal the true nature of this inciu’able afiection. The only Treatment that can be adopted is that calculated to relieve the bladder from the mechanical obstacle to the escape of lu'ine, and to palhatc suffering by ordinary means. Tubercle of the Prostate is occasionally, but rarely’, met with ; and is to870 DISEASES OF THE PROSTATE. be regarded as a manifestation of a constitutional disease. It may lead to ex- tensive suppuration in the ischio-rectal fossa, and possibly to some forms of : fistula in ano. Cheesy masses are occasionally found in the prostate in cases ^ of tubercular disease of the epididymis, vesiculm seminales, and vas deferens. ' In a case which occurred lately in University College Hospital, in which the ' patient died of tuberculai- meningitis after castration for tubercular testicle, two cavities surroimded by cheesy matter, and lai-ge enough to admit the top J of the thumb, were found in the prostate gland. i Cysts or Cavities are sometimes found in the prostate; they may be | dilatations of gland-follicles, abscesses, or cavities containing concretions or > calculi. ] Prostatic Calculi have been abeady described in the Chapter on Urinary 1 Calculus (Vol. II. p. 833). | Prostatorrhcea has been described by Gross as a discharge of elear glairy 1 mucus from the prostate, in consequence of irritation of that organ. The disease is characterised by the discharge of a few drops of ropy, viscid mucus from the urethra after micturition or defecation. It is chiefly of importance from its hability to be confounded with spermatorrhoea, and from the depressing efifeet consequently produced upon the patient’s mind. The Diagnosis of prostatorrhcea from simmatorflicoa may be effected by microscopical examination of the charaeters of the discharge. The Treatment consists in attention to the state of the general health ; the administration of tonics, more especially of iron and nux vomica ; the removal of any local source of initation in the urethra, rectum, or anus, as stricture, piles, or fissure ; and the local application to the prostatic portion of the urethra of the nitrate of silver. The application of a blister to the perinjeum j is beneficial in some cases. IURETHRITIS. 871 CHAPTER LXXII. DISEASES OF THE UEETHRA. UPtETHKITIS. Simple Inflammation of the Urethra is especially apt to occm- in strumous, rheumatic, or gouty individuals, from slight som’ces of irritation, cither direct or sympathetic, that would not excite it in more healthy constitu- tions. In strumous children, it may arise from worms in the intestines, or from gastric irritation; and in gouty or rheumatic subjects, it appears often to occur in connection with an acid or loaded state of the urine. In other cases, the irritation of a stricture, the passage of instruments, or ordinary sexual in- tercourse, may occasion the disease, without there being anything of a specific or venereal character about it. Contact with women who are out of health, pregnant, or suffering from leucorrhoea, may and often does give rise to local in-itation of this kind. Urethritis, especially when arising from sexual inter- course, is frequently mistaken for gonorrhoea; but from this it may be dis- tinguished by the less intense degree of infiammation, and by the absence of the secondary consequences that frequently follow true gonorrhoea; yet, in many instances, the diagnosis is extremely difficult, especially from the subacute forms of gonorrhoea that are common in London. Symptoms.—Urethritis is characterised by heat, pricking, and tension about the urethra for a day or two, followed by muco-purulent discharge, often rather profuse, and accompanied by some ardor m’inte. The symptoms altogether are not severe, and the disease usually subsides at the end of a week or ten days ; but sometimes it becomes chronic, especially if conjoined with stricture, and then constitutes an extremely troublesome affection, more particularly in gouty indiUduals. Treatment.—The treatment of m’ethritis is mildly antiphlogistic. The bowels should be kept open, and salines freely administered ; in many cases small doses of colchiciun, in combination with alkalies, will be foimd of especial service in cutting the disease short. The use of emollient or sfightly astringent injections, such as opiate lotions, or a very weak solution of acetate of lead, with belladonna, will be found serviceable as the disease is on the decline, but not until then ; and when the afiection has reached a chronic stage, small doses of copaiba may be advantageously administered. The diet in all cases should be of the blandest character, stimulants of all kinds being interdicted. If the disease be conjoined with slight stricture, it may not imfrequentlygive rise to temporary retention of urine. This may, however, most commonly be readily relieved by antiphlogistic treatment, cupping or leeches to theDISEASES OF THE URETHRA. 872 peringeum, the warm hii>bath, and salines, with, perhaps, opiate suppositories and plenty of demulcent drinks. The catheter should not be used in these cases, if it be possible to give relief without it. Urethral Abscess occasionally forms as the result of urethritis, a soft fluc- tuating point behig perceived in the neighbourhood of the canal. As soon as this is detected, it should be opened, when the aperture that results will readily close. If left, it will probably not burst externally, but into the urethra, the tissues ill this direction being less resistant; and then, if it should be opened externally as well, a troublesome urinary fistula wiU result. Perineal Abscess may form as the result of stricture or of urethritis, in whatever way excited ; the patient complaining of a sensation of weight, with pain and throbbing, deep in the perinmum. On examination, a hard tense swelling will be found, situated a little anteriorly to the anus, and extending along the side of the imethra. It presents no sign of fluctuation until it comes forwards into the scrotum. The Treatment consists in the application of leeches, followed by fomenta- tions, and an eaily incision through the perimeum into the swelling. In some cases, the abscess is situated altogether externally to the urethra, and then the aperture closes readily enough, like that of any other ordinary abscess. In other cases, it communicates with the canal, and then fistulous openings are left, through which a certain quantity of urine escapes. These apertures gradually tend to close if they be not complicated with strictime or other urethral disease ; should they be so, they will require special treatment, of a kind that will be hereafter described. GONORBHCE3A. Gonorrlicsa is a specific disease, accompanied by inflammation and an abun- dant muco-purulent discharge ; affecting the urethra most commonly, but also the other mucous membraues of the genital organs, as of the prepuce and the glans in the male, and of the vulva and vagina in the female. The urethra is the usual seat of gonorrhoea in the male ; and the disease may be looked on as an infectious inethritis. It is usually fixed with greatest intensity in the fossa navicnlaris; but it may extend itself over a much greater surface, affecting the entire length of the canal, and even the whole mucous lining of the bladder. In the female it commonly spreads over the extensive mucous surface of the internal organs of generation, and sometimes invades the uterus and Fallopian tubes. Cause.—Gonorrhoea has its origin in the female, and is constantly developed dc novo in prostitutes, that is, without infection from the male. It is a highly infective inflammation of the mucous membrane of the vagina generated by the decomposition of retained semen and of foul discharges, the result of repeated acts of indiscriminate intercom’se without proper attention to cleanli- ness. It is impossible to say where urethritis or vaginitis ends, and infective gonon’hoea begins. In the male, gonorrhoea arises in all cases from the ai^ph- cation of a peculiar animal poison, generated in the female by iminne or indis- criminate sexual intercourse, to the parts which it attacks, and must not be confounded with the various non-specific inflammatory diseases that may afiectSYMPTOMS OF GOMOlUUlCFA. 873 the parts commonly the seat of gonorrlima, and which are all chai-acterised by muco-purulent dischai'gcs. The poison of gonorrhoea differs entirely from those of the venereal diseases described in Chapter XXXVL, as has been fully proved by the unerring test of inoculation ; these diseases not being capable of reproducing one another in any circumstances. The inflammatory siippm-ation which is characteristic of gonoiThoea has these peculiarities: 1. It has a distinct and lengthened period of incu- bation ; 2. It rapidly propagates itself by continuity of tissue along the mucous tracts that it affects ; 3. It is contagious in the highest degree not only when the pus is applied to, and, as it were, rubbed into the mucous sm'faces of the generative organs during coitus, but when it simply touches other mucous surfaces ; and 4. It is attended by remote constitutional phenomena partaking of a pyaemic character. Character.—Gronorrhoea is usually looked upon as a purely local affection of the genital organs. Some Sui’geons, however, amongst Avhom may be espe- cially mentioned Travers, seem to consider it as occasionally assuming a con- stitutional character ; in this opinion I entirely agree. Although, gonon’hoea in the eaily stages is doubtless a strictly local affection, yet it is occasionally followed by a particular train of very characteristic phenomena, that can scai’cely be looked upon in any other light than as the result of constitutional infection ; the more so, as some individuals never have gonorrha3a without the disease being followed by these sequences, whilst others are altogether exempt from them. The parts that are secondarily affected ai’e chiefly the fibrous tissues, the mucous and the cutaneous sm’faces. The affections of the fibrous Hssues give rise to, so-called rheumatism and to peculiar forms of inflamma- tion of the testicle and of the sclerotic. The affection of the mucous mem- branes displays itself in specific inflammations of the throat, and of the eyes ; and the sJcin becomes the seat of certain eruptions. The occm’rence of these various affections, assuming as they do a specific type so distinctly marked that they can at once be characterised as gonon-hoeal, certainly tends to show that the disease impresses the constitution in some peculiar maimer, somewhat analogous to syphilis and pyaemia ; though in a ftu’ minor degree, and with much less certainty, than these diseases. Symptohs,—The symptoms of gonorrhoea in the male may be diAuded into three stages:—1. The Incubative Stage, or the period of Irritation; 2. The Acute Inflammatory Stage ; and, 3. The Chronic Stage. 1. Incubative Stage.—The first stage, that of in’itation, usually comes on from three to Aa’o days after connection, when the patient begins to experience some degree of heat, itching, and general irritation about the penis. The lips of the m-ethra are somewhat red and swollen; its orifice gapes ; and, on squeezing it, some mucus exudes. This stage usually continues for three or four days, but sometimes longer, for six or eight, Avhen it terminates in the second stage, Avhich is one of active inflammation. 2, Acute or Inflammatory Stage.—The discharge nOAV becomes abun- dant, thick, and of a groenish-yelloAV-colour ; there is gx’cat pain in passing urine, Avith considerable heat and smarting, and the urine, AA^hich floAvs in a diminished stream, is passed Avith increased frequency. The urethra is SAVollen,DISEASES OF THE UHETIIRA. 874 firm, and cord-like to the touch ; the whole penis, indeed, looks generally red and tiirgescont. As the disease advances, and the bulbous portion of the urethra becomes affected, weight and tension in the peringeum -will be com- plained of. If the prostatic portion be the seat of disease, there will be heat and weight about the anus. During the whole of this period there is generally a good deal of constitutional disturbance, restlessness, and fever. One of the most troublesome symptoms in this stage of the complaint is the occurrence of Chordee, which consists in painful erections at night, with a twist in the body of the penis, which is usually curved down towards the scrotum. 8. Chronic Stage.—These symptoms usually continue for about a fort- night, when the third stage, that of subacute or chronic inflammation, sets in. Diming this period of the affection the inflammatory symptoms gradually sub- side, but a thin muco-purulent discharge keeps up, with some degree of heat and irritation about the urethra, and occasional smarting in passing urine. Under proper treatment, this usually subsides in the course of another fortnight or three weeks ; but, if neglected, or in certain constitutions, it may last for many months, or even years, then degenerating into a Gleet. In proportion to the continuance of the affection the inflammatory symptoms subside, though the specific and contagious character does not disappear, and the affection may continue so long as the discharge keeps up. Himter mentions the case of a girl ■who had been two years in the Magdalen Hospital, and who infected a person with whom she had connection immediately after she left that Institu- tion. The persistence of the contagion of gleet is, it is true, more marked in women than in men. So long, however, as any purulent discharge continues from the male urethra, though it be but a daily drop, the patient must be looked upon as infectious. The severity and the continuance of gonorrhoea are often opposed to one another. Thus the disease is most severe in young and plethoric persons, and in first attacks ; but it is most difficult of cure in strumous and phlegmatic constitutions, more especially if there be a gouty or rheumatic tendency co- existing, and is very troublesome to remove alter repeated attacks. I have observed repeatedly that it is very apt to degenerate into a gleet in people who are subject to chronic eczema. There is a form of chronic gleet which continues very persistently after an attack of gonorrhoeal epididymitis. In these cases the discharge is not so much urethral as testicular. It appears to proceed from the increased exuda- tion from the mucous membrane of the secretory and efferent structures of the testis, during the process of resolution of the inflammation. ^ The length of time that the infection of gleet -will continue in both sexes, but especially in the female, makes it somewhat difficult to say whether the poison of gonorrhoea can be generated de novo, as it is not improbable tha many individuals communicate the disease, believing themselves to be perfectly cured, though still suftering from slight gleet. , i Gleet.—The term gleet is apphed to any mucous or muco-purulent dischai’ge, which is very small in amount and persists for an indefinite time unaccompa- nied by any other obvious symptoms. This condition is one which gives rise to great mental uneasiness in many patients, and some varieties are, more ,875 TREATMENT OF GONORRHCEA. liable to terminate in strictm-e if unrelieved. The correct diagnosis of ite natm-e and source is, therefore, of extreme importance. In the first place, it is necessary to remember that in young men a somewhat copious flow of mucus is apt to accompany an erection of the penis. When, as is frequently the case, an erection occurs just before waking in the morning, the mucus may be fomid glueing the lips of the urethra together, and may be mistaken by the patient for a gleet. Again, true gonorrhoeal gleet must not be confounded with pro- statorrhoca (sec p. 870). Desormeaux has shown by means of the endoscope, that a true gonoiThoeal gleet is due to the presence of chronically inflamed patches of mucous membrane in the urethra. These patches are purphsh or dark red in colour, whereas the normal urethra is a pale pink. Sometimes the surface of the mucous membrane is covered with small granulations, like those seen on the conjunctiva in granular lids. This condition Desormeaux calls “ granular urethritis.” The patches may be multiple, but more often there is only one situated in the bulbous portion of the methra. The sijmjAoms of such a condition are the following. A slight, sometimes almost colomiess sometimes yellowish, discharge will be found glueing the lips of the urethra together in the morning. This discharge is little affected by diet or stimulants, but is usually greatly aggravated by connection. If during micturition the first few drops of urine be passed into a separate vessel, flocculi of mucus and pus are seen floating in it. There is no pain or discomfort in micturition, but the stream may be slightly narrowed, and a few di’ops of urine may be retamed in the m’ethra, and dribble away afterwards, as in a slight strictiue. These in- flamed patches may usually be detected without difficulty by the use of the olive-headed bougie. As the sound passes the inflamed spot, the patient will complain of pain, and on withdrawing it a drop of blood may be found upon its bulb. A shght feehng of resistance to the instrument is also felt. Teeatvient.—The treatment of gonorrhoea must be conducted with re- ference to the stage to which the disease has attaiired, but especially with regard to the amount of inflammatory action accompanying it. It is of two kinds, rational, and specific or empirical. Both plans are useful, and, indeed, usually necessary for a proper cure, but they caimot be adopted indiscrimi- nately. Thus, if specific means be employed dm’ing the acute inflammatory stage of the complaint, much mischief may ensue; whilst, if antiphlogistic treatment be persevered in for too long a time, the disease may be kept up indefinitely. It has been proposed to adopt what has been termed the aloortive ov revulsive treatment, during the earliest stages of gonorrhoea ; indeed, during the incu- bative period. This method consists either in the injection of a very strong solution of the nitrate of silver into the luethra, or in the application to the inflamed mucous membrane of a strong ointment of that salt by means of a bougie smeared with it; other Surgeons, again, have recommended the admi- nistration of very large doses of copaiba at this period. These various plans have, however, deservedly fallen into disrepute. I have on several occasions seen most intense inflammation produced by this mode of treatment, and never, in any case, any good result. Independently of this, it is impossible to know whether the case, in the earliest stage, will prove to be one of simple urethritis or a specific gonoiThcoa.S76 DISEASES OF THE URETHRA. In the aaile injiammaiorij attended by heat, swelling of the organ, gToat ardor urinaa, and abundant muco-purulent discharge, the treatment must be entirely antiphlogistic, the activity of the measures being proportioned to the intensity of the inflammation* If this be very severe, leeches may be applied to the perinmum, or to any very tender point along the urethra. If it be not so intense, warm liip-baths, poppy fomentations, or the envelopment of the penis in warm-Avater dressing, will be of essential service. At the same time the urine must be diluted, and its acidity lessened, by the patient drinking large quantities of alkaline diluents—barley-Avater or linseed-tea containing a little nitre or carbonate of potash in solution, or soda-water ; and the skin and bowels may be kept in action by the administration, every second night of a dose of blue pill, and every fourth or sixth hour, of a powder composed of a drachm of sulphate of magnesia, 5 grains of nitre, and yVth of a grain of tartar emetic, dissolved in a wine-glass of Avater. All stimulants must be avoided, the diet being restricted to light slops, and perfect rest enjoined.. By such means as these, the acti\dty of the inflammation will be gradually lessened, the discharge becoming thinner, and smarting in micturition less severe, and the erections less painfal. The patient should also be desired to j pass his urine frequently, so that it may not be too concentrated. I When the third stage of the disease has been reached, specific treatment ' may be employed with great advantage ; while, if recoimse were had to it at an earlier period, it would certainly increase the inflammatory action and give the patient much distress. Even in this stage the specific remedies, such as copaiba and cubebs, must be cautiously given ; the Surgeon feeling his way Avith them, and being prepared to discontinue them and to retmm to strictly ' antiphlogistic measures, if he find that they increase the irritation. Should the disease, however, from the commencement, haA'e assumed a subacute character, ; the specific treatment may Avith safety be adopted at a much earlier period. Copaiba and cubebs are the remedies that are almost unh^ersally used in this stage of gonorrhoea. Of these, copaiba is the least irritating, and con- sequently most' generally to be preferred. It may be administered in a variety of Avays ; in capside, pill, draught, or extract. The capsule is generally to be preferred, on acount of the nauseous taste being thus more readily disguised ; but in many cases it acts with more certainty, and Avith better effect, if given in cither of the other forms. When the capsules are given, the patient may take from six to eight or ten in the day, and should at the same time have an alkaline mixtme, which increases materially the effect of the drug. A very excellent mode of administering copaiba is to rub it doAAUi into a mass with biniit magnesia, and to let the patient take about a drachm of this paste three times a day, in a bolus wrapped in wafer-paper ; or, if the taste be not much objected to, he may take it most advantageously in mucilage, with liquor potassm and tincture of henbane. In some relaxed constitutions, and more particidarly after frequent clap, ' cubebs will be found to cine the patient more readily than copaiba, or rather most successfully if given in combination with it. An excellent plan is to pi about half an ounce of powdered cubebs into a mortar, and to rub it up wt 1 ns much copaiba as AviU form a stiff' paste, of Avhich the patient shoidd take a drachm as a bolus thrice daily. The effects of this electuary are often most877 INJECTION'S IN GONORRHOEA. strikin" ; but it can only be used in the constitutions indicated, and after the more active inflammatory symptoms have subsided. It is during the third stage of gonorrhoea that Injections may advan- tageously be used. j\ruch and 'S'ery unfounded prejudice exists against their use in the minds of many ; but surely it is as safe to apply proper local applications to an inflamed urethra as it is to an inflamed conjunctiva ; and the bad conse- cptences, sueh as stricture and inflamed testicle, which have sometimes been referred to their use, have either been due rather to the long continuance and to the severity of the disease itself than to the remedies employed, or to their application at too early a stage or of too groat a strength. It is in long- standing cases of gonorrhoea, in which the discharge continues for months or years, that stricture results, not in cases of ordinary duration ; and in these it is the result of the chronic inflammatory thickening of the mucous membrane, and has no more to do with the injections than with the copaiba or salines which the patient may have taken. As the ardor urinm subsides, emollient and slightly astringent injections may be used. The best is perhaps the ace- tate of lead in tepid water, of the strength of two grains to the oimce. If this induce irritation, a few grains of the watery extract of opium may advan- tageously be added. As the disease subsides, a stronger astringent is required, and then one or two grains of the acetate of zinc may be added to each ounce of the injection ; or a very weak solution of sulphate or chloride of zinc may he employed, gr. ij of the first, and gr. j of the second, to each ounce of water ; or an injection of gr. of the nitrate of silver to the ounce may be used. During the whole of this stage, the diet and habits of life must be carefully regulated, and all stimulants interdicted. The injections should be discontinued as soon as the discharge has ceased ; unless this be done, they may re-induce it. The mode of injection is of imjDortance. A glass syringe should always be used, with a smooth rounded nozzle. The patient sitting on the edge of the chair and holding up the penis, should carefully insert the end of the syringe between the lips of the m-ethra, and then slowly throw in the injection as far as it will go. Al- though the inflammation is usually confined to the an- terior portion of the urethra, yet it may extend to the bulb, and the injection should be applied to the whole length of the inflamed mucous membrane. If any enter the bladder it cannot signify, as it will immediately be deeomposed by the salts and mucus of the urine. ^ Instead of the ordinary glass syringe, the injector (Fig /.)o) may be advantageously used. This injection is thrown from behind forwards, so that when passed beyond the mflamed part it washes out the discharge, instead of foreing it further on.

It will eonstantly be found that, after the disease has apparently been cured, excesses at table, and more ospecially the drinking of beer, or of effervescing or acid wines, Avill brin<^ back the discharge. It will also return after connection, though it have pieviously ceased entirely. This is especially the case in strumous, gouty, or xheumatic constitutions, in which all urethral inflainmations are with difficulty removed. In these cases, then, abstiirence ffiom alcoholic liquids and dietetic stimulants, and a continent life must be strictly enjoined ; but the local treat- ment requires careful attention. The conditions of the urethral mucous membrane has already been fully described. This condition is difficult of cure ; for, as Desormeaux has pointed out, no injection, which the healthy portion of the urethra is capable of bearing, will have much effect upon the inflamed patch. He therefore recommends the application of a very strong solution of nitrate of silver through the endoscope ; but equally satisfactory results may be obtained by the use of Guyon’s injector (Frg. 796). This consists of a hollow bulbous sound perforated in the bulb, and Fig. 796.—Guyon’s Injector. Tlie SmaUcr Figure represents the Nozzle. fitted with a small syringe. The bulbous sound having been passed first up and down the urethra till the exact situation of the inflamed spot is found by the tenderness and shght cling before mentioned, the perforated head is held fixed ■at the diseased spot, and a few drops of a solution of nitrate of silver (ten to twenty grains to the oimce of water) are injected. The patient should pass lu’ine immediately before the injection, and not again for some hours if possible. Berkeley Hill, who has had great experience of this mode of treatment, states that, if the patient keep quiet for some time after, no complications are likely to follow ; but neglect of these precautions may be followed by swelled testicle or even perineal abscess. After the operation, a weak astringent injection must be used for a few days, and the passage of bougies for a short time after is usually necessary to complete the cure. Otis, of Hew York, is of opinion that every prolonged gleet is the result of a narrowing of the canal, and he recom- mends internal urethrotomy as a ciu’e—cutting the m-ethi-a up to its normal size by the method described under the treatment of strictm-e of the urethra. The operation is somewhat severe, and should ne^’er be had resort to till milder means have failed. The treatment of gleet may therefore be summed up as follows. The patient must be carefully examined, in order to detect if possible some con- stitutional condition, such as struma, gout, or rheumatism, which may serve as a guide as to general treatment, diet, and use of stimulants. Change of air and sea-bathing are often of essential service. At the same time, the electuary of cubebs and copaiba, or one composed of cubebs and the sesquioxide of iron.879 COMPLICATIONS OF GONORRIKEA. may bo administcrod ;vith advantage, and the chronic sta^e of gononlKca may be persevered w.th. Sbonld these far, and shoiUd the” olive-headed sound give distinct evidence of a_tender spot, ant perhaps a slight narrowing of the urethra, the passage of a full bonvic every second or third day should be tried. If, after a fair tiial, this faiMo, injection of nitrate of silver by Guyou's injector must next be had recourse to, followed by mild injections and the passage of bougies ; and, lastly, if everything else have failed, and a distinct narroinng of the canal be present, internal urethrotomy may be tried as a last resource. COJIPLICATIOXS OP Go^^ORI^H(EA.—Gonorrhoea, when acute or virulent, seldom runs its course without local complications of some kind, the result of the propagation of the inflammation to neighbouring parts, often of consider- able severity, and occasionally even hirzardous to life ;—such as chordee, phimosis, sympathetic bubo, perineal abscess, irritability of the bladder, reten- tion of urine, hiemorrhage from the imethra, &c. Many of these complications present no special features, but require to be treated on general principles, without reference to their specifle cause. Others demand more special manage- ment, and these we may liriefly consider here. Inflammatioii of the Lymphatics of the Frsenum may occur, stretching along the sides and dorsum of the penis in the form of hard thread-like lines, with much redness and oedema of the integuments, and general swelling of the ■organ, the glans in these cases often assuming a turgid aspect and a dnU brick-red colour. This condition is a very serious one, as it may lead to one of two conse- ■quences, or both may ensue, viz., inflammation and suppuration of the inguinal glands, or blood-poisoning. It is the latter result that gives rise to the most serious constitutional effects in gonorrhoea, closely resembling the less severe forms of pyemia, viz., the so-called gonoirhoeal rheumatism, and abscess in or ■around the prostate. Chordee, or painful erection of the penis, with twist of the organ, coming- on at night, is often a most distressing and troublesome symptom. It is usually best relieved by the application of cold to the part, but more especially by the administration at bed-time of a pill composed of gr. j of opium with gr. v of ■camphor, the camphor acting as a direct sedative to the generative organs. Eiicord recommends a suppository of camphor and opium, gr. x of camphor, and gr. j of the watery extract of opium, to be introduced into the rectum an hour before bed-time, as the best means of remo’sdng the tendency to chordee. Irritability of the Bladder with Spasm of its Heck, Strangury, and Dysuria, may be of two kinds ; either inflammatory, coming on in the ■earlier stages of the disease with pain in the peringeum, and all the symptoms of active inflammation about the part strongly marked ; or atonic, supervening at a more advanced period, without any special signs of inflammation. In the first case, leeches to the perinaium, hot poppy fomentations, the warm bidet, with full doses of Dover’s powder, or of henbane and carbonate of potash or nitre, Avill afford much relief. IVhen the disease is atonic, the administration of tincture of perchloride of iron, conjoined with local soothing remedies, as the poppy fomentations or bidet, and an opiate or belladonna suppository, will be beneficial.88o DISEASES OF THE URETHRA. Cystitis, of an acute character, may occur either by the metastasis or the exteusiou of tlie urethral inflammation. When there is metastasis the urethral discharge diminishes or cither ceases, just as in epididymitis ; the patient is seized with intolerable and frequent dysuria, strangury, and general febrile distiu-bance. The urine becomes loaded with muco-pus. The condition is perilous. There is danger to life if the constitution be broken, and there is always danger of prolonged or possibly intractable subacute cystitis. The Treaimejit of this condition consists in the employment of belladonna or opiate suppositories; the frequent use of warm hip-baths ; the application of fomentations to the perinaeum, and of hot poultices to the pubic region. Brodie makes the important practical statement that, if the urine continue acid, the best treatment consists in the administration of calomel and opium. This is entirely in accordance with my experience, and where the patient is moderately young, and the urine acid, with pulse good, calomel -nuth opium, or i Dover’s powder, will give effectual relief. As the cystitis subsides, the urethral j discharg ere-appears. ; Retention of Urine from Gonorrhoea may set in at any period of the acute stage. The obstruction is usually dependent on congestion and inflam- mation of the mucous membrane of the urethra. Leeches to the perinseum, the warm hip-bath, and opiate suppositories, will probably afford relief. It is always desirable to avoid using the catheter, as it is apt to lacerate the swollen i and softened mucous membrane, and thus to occasion troublesome bleeding ;• | and will always produce much pain, and increased in’itation of the canal. j Should, however, the retention have continued twenty-four hours, or longer, it I will probably not give way to the means above indicated, and then it will he- | necessary to use the instrument, when a fuU-sized silver one should be very ; carefully introduced ; a large instrument entering the bladder as easily as a smaller one, and with less risk of injury to the tender walls of the canal. "^^Tien the catheter has been introduced, it is often somcAvhat difficult to^ determine whether it should be left in or taken out. If it be left in, inflam- matory action is increased. If it be taken out, the Surgeon may not be able- easily to introduce it again. The solution to this question is to be found in the- facility with which the instrument is passed. If it have been introduced without much difficulty, it is better to withdraw it after the bladder has- been emptied, and to continue the antiphlogistic treatment, when a second introduction may not be required. If, on the other hand, the catheter have- been passed with great difficulty, and be firmly gi-asped either by spasm or stricture, it should be left in ; but very active treatment must be employed to prevent it from exciting too much inflammation. It must, however, be remembered that the retention may be due to more serious conditions; to prostatitis, to abscess in the prostate or the perinaeum, or to inflammatory exudation in the tissues about the neck of the bladder. In these circumstances, more active antiphlogistic measures will be required, ' with the use of the catheter twice in the twenty-four hours, and probably free incisions into the perina^um, if there be pus or urine extravasated into that region. In many cases of gonorrhoeal retention, an old stricture complicates the clap. Here the employment of energetic antiphlogistic measures and the use of the88i GONORltlKEAL EPIDIDYMITIS. catheter are indicated ; but, as the stricture is the chief cause of obstruction, the treatment must be directed to it. ^ i, « i i Hemorrhage from the Urethra may occur either as the result ot chordee, and consequent rupture of some blood-vessels of the coiq)US spongiosum, as the consequence of attempts at passing the catheter, or as a kind of exudation from the mucous membrane. Most commonly it may be arrested by the application of ice, and the employment of moderate local antiphlogistic treatment. Should it be abundant, the introduction of a large gmn-elastic catheter, and pressure by means of a bandage to the penis or peiinmum, will arrest it. Sequences of Gonorrhoea.—The sequences, or more remote complications of gonorrhoea, are partly local and partly constitutional. Amongst the local we find more particularly Warts about the prepuce and glans or within the urethral orifice, which require to be treated by excision or caustics ; and Stricture, the management of which is fully described elsewhere. In some cases, also, in consequence of extravasation of blood, or the effusion of plastic mattei' into the corpus spongiosum or the corpora cavernosa, limited and localised Induration and Thickening of the Penis may result, attended by chordee, painful erections, and a permanent twist in the organ. In such conditions as these, an attempt may be made to produce absorption of the effused mass, by the administration of small doses of bichloride of mercury, with the inunction of iodide of lead ointment. After the cure of a clap that has been of long continuance, the generative organs are often left in a toeah and irritable state; the penis, scrotum, and spermatic cords being lax and elongated, with an apparent want of power, and often painful and dragging sensations about the cords and groins. Besides the strictly local complications of gonorrhoea, certain sequences, to which some constitutions are especially liable, occasionally occur as the result of this disease ; viz., inflammation of the testes and of the eyes, rheumatism, cutaneous eruptions, and sore throat. Some df these, as the affections of the eyes and testes, may be either local or constitutional; the others are clearly constitutional. The constitutional effects of gonorrhoea offer characters that have some analogy to those presented by the more chronic and subacute forms of pytemia. This is more especially .the case in monarthritic inflamma- tion of the knee or wi’ist, leading to disorganisation or permanent ankylosis of these joints. Gonorrhceal Epididymitis is certainly the most common of these sequences. It most invariably affects only one testis, and commences in the epididymis, whence it extends to the body of the organ. It usually occurs in individuals who have a lax and long scrotum, with very pendulous testes. It seldom sets in before the third week after the occurrence of gonorrhoea, but may occiu at any period during the continuance of the discharge, though it is more frequent between the fifth and sixth weeks than at any other time. In cases of gleet, also, it not uncommonly occurs at a Iqter period. In many instances it is refciTed to some slight injury—a blow, or squeeze, received during the con- tinuance of the gonoiThoea ; but in some cases it would appear to arise from extension of the inflammation along the ejaculatory duct; and in others from a kind of metastasis of the morbid action from the urethra to the testis. ThatDISEASES OF THE URETHRA. 882 the disease commences in the epididymis, may be advanced in support of the first opinion ; whilst the fact that the discharge usually ceases when the in- flammation of the testicle comes on, and returns as it subsides, may be adduced in support of the doctrine of its metastatic origin. Curling is of opinion that the diminution of discharge is due to counter-in-itation, as he has seen a case in which the urethral discharge ceased, although the orchitis had been occasioned by a blow. As the symptoms and treatment of gonon-hoeal inflammation of the testicle present nothing peculiar, I shall reserve their consideration until we speak of diseases of this organ. Gonorrhoeal epididymitis is apt to be followed by long-continued gleet, consequent on the exudation from the lining membranes of the inflamed vas deferens, and the secretory apparatus of the testes. Gonorrhoeal Inflammation of the Eyes is fortunately not of very common occun-ence. It may affect either the conjunctiva or the sclerotica. Gonorrhoeal Conjunctivitis is one of the most destructive forms of ophthalmia, giving rise not unfrequently, in the course of forty-eight hours, to the most intense chemosis, with opacity and softening of the cornea, followed by staphyloma and a discharge of the humoiu’s. In the majority of instances only one eye is affected ; but, in some, both are involved to an equal extent. The disease commences with the ordinary symptoms of conjunctival inflammation ; itching and swelling of the eyelids, velvety redness of the con- junctiva, muco-purulent discharge, with much lachrymation. The chemosis sets in early, and is very severe ; and, unless treatment afford speedy rehef, the consequences are most disastrous to vision. Lawrence states that, of 14 cases that feU under his observation, 9 had only one eye affected and 5 both. Of the nine in whom one eye only was diseased, the organ was lost in 6 cases ; of the 5 in whom both eyes were affected, both organs were destroyed in one case; in 2 one eye only was lost; one patient recovered imperfectly; and in only one did complete recovery ensue. It has been a question with Siu’geons, whether gonoiThoeal oiDhthalmia is the result of the direct application of the specific pus to the conjimctiva, or occurs as a constitutional disorder. There can be little doubt that the application of the pus to the surface of the conjunctiva will occasion the disease, but at the same time it is perfectly certain that in many instances there is no evidence of contact, the inflammation occurring in both eyes without the patient having apparently communicated it; and, though it is necessarily difficult to adduce positive proof on this point, it is but reasonable to presume that such cases may be constitutional. The Trccdment of this dangerous affection must be of an active character ; blood should be taken freely from the temples by cupping, or, if the patient be sufficiently robust, from the arm, as strongly recommended by Lawi-ence, who placed gTeat reliance on it; he must of course be kept in a dark room, and on strict antiphlogistic regimen. The disease must, however, be met, and the eye cap alone be saved, by active local treatment. The most active topical agent that we possess is the nitrate of silver. The use of this astrin- gent, originally introduced by Little, has been much insisted on by Guthrie, Walker, and others, and is generally adopted at the present day, being certainly the most useful agent that we possess. Surgeons differ somewhat in opinionGONORIUKEAL rheumatism. 883 as to the strength of the application ; some, the Germans especially, advise that the solid stick should be used ; whilst others employ it in solution, of the strength of a drachm to the ounce of distilled water. Wharton Jones employs a weaker solution, one of four or five grains to the ounce, and I have seen cases very successfully treated by this plan ; so much so, indeed, that I am disposed to prefer it to the stronger solution. A few drops must be introduced about twice in the twenty-four hours, into the inner canthus of the eye ; the lids in the meantime being kept covered by compresses dipped in weak alum lotion, and the purulent discharge, as it accumulates, carefully washed away by tepid ahun injections. In doing this, great care must be taken that none of the discharge come into contact with the eyes of the Surgeon or nm-scs, as it is highly contagious, and AviU almost to a certainty produce the disease ; instances are recorded in which, in this way, the attendant’s vision has been destroyed. If the chemosis be considerable, it must be incised ; and, as the inflammation subsides, belladonna lotions may be employed u-ith advantage, and the use of the nitrate of silver gradually discontinued. Gonorrhceal Sclerotitis is by no means of such frequent occurrence as the conjunctival inflammation ; when it happens, it wiU commonly be found to be associated vdth gonorrhoeal rheumatism, and not unfrequently with inflam- mation of the testicle, occun’ing apparently in individuals in whom there is a tendency to affection of the fibrous tissues. This disease is evidently of con- stitutional origin, as it cannot possibly arise from local contagion; it is attended by the ordinary signs of sclerotic inflammation, and is usually accompanied by some degree of iritis. In the Treatment there is nothing very peculiar. Cupping or leeches to the temples, with belladonna fomentations, are the principal local means ; and calomel and opium, continued until the gums are affected, constitute the chief internal remedies; these means must be persevered in until the anterior chamber clears, and any effused lymph is absorbed. As the disease declines, and especially if the patient be somewhat debilitated, soda, rhubarb, and bark in powder may be given internally, and blisters kept open on the temples. Inflamination of the Nose, attended by profuse suppuration, is a com- plication that I have more than once had occasion to observe in gonon'hoea. The swelling of the organ is considerable, the tenderness great, and the discharge abundant; a condition, indeed, of the Schneiderian membrane that seems analogous to the inflammation of the conjunctiva just described. The Ireatment that I have found to succeed best, consists in fomentations followed by astiingent lotions or injections. Gonorrhoeal Rheumatism prmcipally occurs in young and otherwise healthy persons. It is of two kinds; in one, the most common, and indeed, the typical variety, the fibrous and muscular structures are affected ; in the other the joints are impheated. It is a disease that appears to be closely associated with some forms of blood-poisoning—possibly in some cases with pyaemia. It is of two kinds, the fibroid or plastic, and the suppiuative. The fibroid is intimately associated with those forms of blood-disease in ■\\ ich fibrinous exudations are formed in internal organs, more especially on the serous surfaces, as the pleura, the peri-, and the endocardium. The fibroid 3 L 2DISEASES OF THE URETHRA. 884 or plastic form of gonon-hocal rheumatism is not unft-equently accompanied by inflammation of the testicle or of the sclerotic. It commonly affects the fleshy parts of the body, as the hips, the shoulders, and the thighs, and not unfre- quently occurs in the soles of the feet. It is always very painful at night, but is not commonly attended by any very severe constitutional disturbance. The suppurative, more rare, appears in truth to be a variety of pya3mia, directlv due to self-infection of the patient from pus retained in the deeper portions of the urethra or contaminating the system through the medium of the lymphatics. In these cases, the inflammation, when it affects a large joint, is always monar- thritic. The knee is the one that specially suffers, permanent ankylosis conse- quent on destruction of cartilage resulting. The synovial form presents the ordinary characters of severe and often destructive inflammation of the joint, the knee or ankle being chiefly involved. Ankylosis is the chief danger to be apprehended as a remote result of gonorrhoeal arthritis, and it is mostly incurable. Treatment—In the plastic form small doses of calomel and opium, followed by iodide of potassium, should be steadily given. In the more truly arthritic form of the disease, mercurials are not so much needed, and the chief reliance should be on the iodide of potassium with alkaline tonics. The local joint affection must be treated by absolute rest, blistering, and mercmlal inunction. The most favom’able termination will be in ankylosis, which must be treated as described p. 235. Cutaneous Eruptions, chiefly consisting of roseola, with shght pityilasis, and perhaps a few patches of psoriasis with very flimsy scales, occasionally occur in rather severe cases of gonorrhoea, usually appearing from six weeks to three months after the commencement of the attack. They are chiefly diffused about the chest and belly, and present no sign of coppery redness. At the time of their occmrence, the fauces commonly become similarly involved, presenting, as was first pointed out by Travers, a diffused superficial redness on the velum palati and pillars, with perhaps superficial ulceration on these, the tonsils, or the uvula. The occin-rence of these affections is usually pre- ceded by slight febrile action, which, however, subsides on their full evolution. The roseolar eruptions occiuTing dining gonorrhoea must not be mistaken for the rash occasionally produced by copaiba. The Treatment consists in the administration of salines, followed by iodide of potassium in moderate doses. Mercurials are not required. Gonorrhcfia in the Female differs from the same affection in the male in not being so severe, though it is usually more extensive, and of longer dination. The severity is less, on account of the shortness of the female urethra preventing the occurrence of the retention of urine as in the male, and also from the absence of such parts as the prostate, testes, &c., the implication of which constitutes the principal som-ce of difficulty in men. , Gonorrhoea in the female may affect the part to very different degi-ees; ' thus the vulva alone may be implicated, or, as most commonly happens, the inflammation may spread to the whole of the mucous membrane of the vao-ina The urethra is less commonly the seat of disease, though occa- sionally implicated with other parts ; and, lastly, the interior of the uterus may become affected by this specific inflammation. In some cases it willTREATMENT OF GONORRIKEA IN THE FEMALE. 885 even spread along the Fallopian tubes to the ovaries : and ovaritis and fatal peritonitis may also bo induced. _ i i The Symptoms of gonorrhoea in women arc sufficiently well marked :n the early stages, when there is an abundant muco-purulent discharge from the parts affected, with a good deal of inflammatory irritation, accompanied with pain in micturition, and a frequent desire to pass urine.^ As the disease becomes chronic, however, it is more difficult to determine its true character ; it being apt to be confounded with some of those accidental and leucorrhocal discharges to which females of all ages are subject. Diagnosis.—In the majority of cases, goiioiThoea may be distinguished from all other muco-puruUnt discharges of the female organs, by the presence of inflammation about the external parts, and the mucous membrane of the vagina and urethra. In these cases it will be found, on introducing a speculum (which, however, occasions considerable pain, and is flrmly grasped by the con- traction of the vagina), that the discharge comes from the vaginal wall, and that the uterine oriflee is free from it, or nearly so ; whereas m leucorrhoea the discharge proceeds in a great measure from the interior of the uterus, the os and cervix of which udll probably also present signs of diseased action. It must, however, be borne in mind that the discharge in gonorrhoea may occa- sionally be in a great degree uterine ; and that that of leucoiThoea may be an exudation from the mucous membrane of the vagina. In such circumstances, when the disease is chronic, it is almost impossible to arrive at a correct con- clusion as to the natiue of the case from simple inspection ; and in these cases of doubt the Sm’geon had better give a very guarded opinion, lest he be led into the error of inculpating an innocent woman. The difficulty is increased, and a good deal of obsem-ity thrown over the case, by the fact that leucorrhoeal discharges will occasionally give rise to urethritis in the male, which closely simulates gonoiThoea, Female Children also are occasionally subject to an acute inflammation of the vagina and nymphm as the result of simple initation, of constitutional disturbance, or of teething ; these cases require to be recognised, as they have frequently been the cause of unfounded accusations. The Treatment of gonon’hoea in the female must vary, according as the disease is acute or chronic. In the acute stage, general and local anti- phlogistic means—salines, low diet, rest in bed, and emoUient sedative fomentations—must be used. As the disease subsides into a chronic con- dition, astringent injections must be employed; a weak solution of acetate of lead, or the liquor aluminis compositus largely diluted ■with tepid water, being especially useful. In other cases, a weak solution of nitrate of silver may be used with much advantage. These injections should be employed three or four times a day and in large quantity. After they have been thro'wu up, a piece of lint well soaked in the lotion should be introduced between the opposed mucous surfaces, so as to prevent their coming into apposition, the discharge being in a great measure kept up by their friction against one another.^ In order that the injection may be properly given, the woman should lie flat on her back, and pump in the fluid by means of one of Kennedy’s elastic bottles. In the treatment of gonorrhoea in women, specifics are of no use unless the urethra be affected, when copaiba may be given, as in the male.DISEASES OF THE URETHRA. 886 The disease is apt to degenerate into a chronic glccty condition, leaving a thin | mneo-pnrifonn discharge, which will continue to be infectious for a great i length of time. STBICTUBE OP THE UBETHBA. Much discrepancy of opinion for a long time existed as to the structure of the urethra, some Surgeons admitting, others denying its muscularity. Though the presence of muscular fibres in the urethra had been suspected by many in consequence of the phenomena presented by some forms of stricture being solely explicable in this way, it is only in recent times that their existence has been demonstrated ; KoUiker and Hancock having shown that the tube is surrounded through its entire length with an organic muscular coat. Hancock has demonstrated the coiu’se of these fibres. He has pointed out that the fibres of the inner layer of the muscular coat of the bladder pass forwards underneath the mucous membrane of the prostatic portion of the urethra, and those from the outer layer of the muscular coat of the bladder outside the prostate. These two layers join at the membranous portion of the urethra, forming the mus- cular covering of this portion of the canal. At the bulb, these two layers divide again; the inner lying underneath the mucous membrane, separated from it merely by areolar tissue ; the external lying outside the corpus spongio- sum, between it and its fibrous investment. At the anterior extremity of the urethra, they unite again and form its lips. Thus the urethra is siuTOunded through its whole length by muscular fibres, a double layer of which invests it at the membranous portion, and again at the external meatus. The prostate and corpus spongiosum are included between planes of these fibres. The vesicles and ducts of the prostate are surrounded by layers of organic fibre ; those of the ejaculatory ducts coming from the organic layer of the vas deferens. These fibres are totally distinct from the common muscular apparatus of the perinEBum ; and their existence proves the lu’ethra to be, as had often been suspected, a musculo-membranous canal. By Stricture of the Urethra is meant a na^ro^ving of the canal at one or more points. These may proceed from three distinct conditions; viz.—1, Spasmodic Action of the layer of the organic Muscular Fibres situated outside the mucous membrane ; 2, Congestion of the Mucous Membrane of the canal; or, 3, Organic Changes in the Mucous and Submucous Tissues, consisting of thickening, indm’ation, or the deposit of plastic matter within them. Ac- cording as the disease arises from one or other of these causes, it may be termed a Spasmodic, a Gong&stive, or an Organic strictiu’e. These dift'eient forms of the disease having the one condition—narrowing of the iwethra and its consequences, in common, and in practice being often associated together, present so much variety in their symptoms, in the treatment they require, and in the constitutions in which they occur, as to require separate ' description. • ■ i i Spasmodic Stricture.—The existence of this form of constriction has been much cavilled at. Surgeons, disregarding the evidence of their own senses, and being led away by an imperfect anatomical examination of the urethra, have denied the possibihty of spasm of this canal, not being able to demonstrate thetreatment of spasmodic stricture. 887 existence of any muscular fibres in sufficiently close proximity to the mucous meXL to infineiioe it bj their action. The possession of m^uiar contrac- tilitv by the urethra is, however, obvious from the facts that a bougie may occa^sionally be introduced with sufficient case, but that the Surgeon, 011 attemptincT^to withefraw it, wiU find it tightly grasped; so also, occasional y, on infroducing the instrument, he ivill feel it meet with an obstruction, whic on steady pressure will yield with that species of quivering that is peculiai to fibre' Again, the fact that a patient wifi at one time pass Ifis m-ine with the most perfect freedom, whilst, if it be rendered acrid or acid bv drinkino- spirits, effervescent wines, or other similar beverages, almost com- plete obstruction will ensue, tends to prove the existence of an occasional spasmodic constriction of the canal. These facts, though sufficiently con- vincing to many Surgeons, had failed to carry proof of the existence of spasmodic stricture to others, until the researches of KoUiker and Hancock, which have been referred to, set the question of the muscularity of the urethi’a finally at rest. Causes. The causes of spasmodic stricture are generally such conditions as occasion a relaxed and imtable state of system, as long residence m hot cli- mates, especially if conjoined with habitual excesses in drinking, high living and sexual indulgences. The more immediate causes are usually any circum- stances that occasion iriitation of the urethral mucous membrane, which being- propagated to the organic muscular fibres beneath, calls them into actmty, and thus gives rise to the spasmodic affection. The most usual of these are those conditions of the system in which the hthates are largely eliminated ; as exposure to cold and wet, by which the action of the skin is suspended ; or too free an indulgence in spirituous and acid hquors—such as red or effervescent wines, beer, or punch—which are well known to give rise to an attack in many constitutions. Symptoms.—In spasmodic stricture we find evidence of narrowing of the urethra, and consequent impediment to the free flow of urine, rapidly super- vening under the influence of certain causes, and as speedily subsiding. A patient, for instance, in his ordinary health and passing luine freely, if he take such food or drink as wiU give rise to a very acid condition of this fluid ; if he be exposed to cold, or get out of health in any way ; suddenly finds himself able only to pass his urine in a small stream by drops with much straining, or may even be seized with complete retention. Under appropriate treatment these symptoms rapidly subside ; recurring, however, on the application of any exciting cause. At the time of the occurrence of this spasm there is often a sensation of weight and uneasiness in the perimeum, with evident irritation of the urethral mucous membrane, as shown by reddening of the lips of the orifice; in fact, a tendency to a combmation of the congestive Avith the spasmodic form of stricture. There will often be found to be a very shght organic stricture hi cases of the spasmodic form of this disease ; so that, when the spasm subsides, the urethra Avill not be quite so free as natural. Treatment.—If the patient be suffering from spasmodic difficulty in passing urine, a suppository, consisting of half a drachm of laudanum in a little starch, should be thrown up the rectum, or a full dose of Dover’s powder administered, and the warm hip-bath used. As the opium begins to take effect, the mineDISEASES OF THE URETHRA. 888 will iisiifilly be passed without much difficulty. The bowels should then be made to act, when the patient will usually be relieved. If the spasm continue as It often does, for some days or weeks after this, a full-sized bourne should be introduced e^-ery second or third day, in order to lessen the irrita- bility of the urethra. In some cases, this is more effectually done by the use of a plated bougie well warmed and oiled. Whatever instrument is used should be of large size, from No. 8 to 10. A small bougie will often be arrested, and Avill create much irritation, when a large one will pass readily. If the use of the instrument cause irritation and increase of spasm, it is better to omit it entirely, and to trust to constitutional treatment. But the Sm-geon must not be discoiuaged, if the first few introductions of the bougie appear to increase the irritation; as the urethra becomes accustomed to the use of the instru- ment, relaxation of the spasm will take place. At the same time, the patient’s general health should be carefully attended to ; the bowels must be kept open, and the diet regulated; aU acids, stimulants, and sweets being carefully avoided! Dm-ing the time when the bougie is being used, he should take the citrate of potash weU diluted. As a preventive treatment of these attacks, a careful regulation of the diet, warm clothing Avith the use of flannel, and keeping the skin in action by means of horsehair gloves and tepid baths, will be found serviceable. Congestive Stricture.—Many Surgeons look upon spasmodic stricture as essentially dependent on congestion of the mucous membrane of the luethi’a, overlooking altogether the existence of spasm, or considering it as the result of irritation of the perineal muscles, and not of the true organic muscles of thc’ canal. That the tAvo conditions of congestion and spasm are frequently associated in the imethra, in the relation of cause and effect, there can be no- doubt ; and this is the most frequent condition in which spasmodic strictures are found. Indeed, congestion plays an important j>art in all forms of stric- ture ; it may, as we have just seen, he connected AAuth the spasmodic A'ariety ; it may occur a,lone; or it may be associated Avith organic strictm-e. Some parts of the urethra appear to be more subject to congestion than others; thus, for instance, the membranous and prostatic portions, especially the folds of mucous membrane constituting the verumontanum, are peculiarly liable to- become congested. Causes.—Congestive stricture frequently occurs as the result of chronic and long-continued inflammation of the urethra, or of the passage of mine that has been rendered irritating by being too concentrated, or by an admixture of an undue proportion of lithates. It is especially in gouty or rheumatic sub- jects who suffer from irritability of the skin and mucous membranes that this condition occurs. In these cases there is no true or permanent obstruction, but the disease is transitory, and solely due to a swollen state of the membrane of the part. But in the majority of cases it complicates and aggi’aA’ates seriously spasmodic and slight organic strictures. Symptoms.—In congestive stricture we not only find the common symptoms occasioned by an impediment of the fr’ee passage of the urine, but some SAA^elling of the lips of the m’ethra, Avith reddening and eA’ersion of them. There is also slight gleety exudation, and not unfrequently an abundant puriform discharge, in fact, imethritis of a marked kind, Avith a sense of weight or fulness in theORGANIC STRICTURE. SS9 jx;riii£eum, pain in micturition, and sometimes uneasiness in defecation. This state of things constitutes a very troublesome aflection, intimately connected with the various forms of urethritis, and exceedingly apt to relapse from apparently very trivial circumstances, slight errors of diet, dyspeptic derange- ments, or any local sources of irritation. The Treatment in these cases should consist in careful regulation of the diet and habits of life, and especially in the administration of the citrate of potash, and the saline aperient mineral waters, as those of Carlsbad or Friediichshall. If there bo much tenderness or weight about the perinmum, the application of leeches to this part, together with the use of the warm hip-bath, will be serviceable. Congestive stricture, though more influenced by constitutional than by local means in many cases, yet requires the introduction of bougies in order to pre- vent the constriction from becoming permanent. In some instances a wax, in others a silver or pewter instrument, will be found to answer best. Whatever is used, care should be taken to introduce it slowly and with every possible gentleness. With all care, some haemorrhage usually follows the passage of the instriunent; not from laceration, but simply as the result of compression of , the mucous membrane ; and the discharge of blood appears rather to be beneficial than otherwise. Organic Stricture.—This, the true form of strictiu’e, is the result either of chronic inflammation of the m’ethra, leading to thickening of the mucous membrane, or of injiuy from blows or kicks in the perinmum, by which a portion of it is torn and heals by a contracted cicatrix. Repeated gonorrhoeas and long-continued gleets are the most fertile causes of this disease. In the urethra as elsewhere, plastic matter is deposited in and around the mucous membrane in the submucous areolar tissue, as the result of inflammation ; con- solidation of this takes place, followed by contraction of the canal. The long continuance of inflammation is more to be dreaded than its intensity in occasioning this mischief; hence it is of great importance not to allow gleets to run on indeflnitely, as they wiU almost to a certainty be followed by con- striction of some portion of the urethra. Arje.—Stricture of the urethra may be met with at any age after puberty. The causes that usually give rise to it seldom come into operation, however, before the adult age ; hence strictures are not A'ery common before 25 years of age. Between that period and the age of 40 they most commonly originate, and may then continue for an indeflnite period. The earhest age at which I have seen true organic strictiu’e of the urethra has been in a boy 14 years old, when it had aheady existed for more than 12 months; it was situated one and a half inches fr’om the meatus, and was so tight as oifly to admit of Ho. 1 catheter. It was complicated with and had given rise to a flstula in perinmo, through which the greater part of the urine escaped. The boy in whom it occurred could give no explanation of its occurrence, but it was probably traiunatic. His attention was first directed to it by a sudden attack of reten- tion. A he stricture was hard and gristly, about half an inch long, and required urethrotomy for its relief. There was no calculus. Seat.—The seat of organic stricture vailes considerably ; indeed, any portion of the urethra may be affected by it, except the prostatic. It appears to be theSgo DISEASES OF THE URETHRA. common belief amongst Surgeons, that tbe membranous portion of the eanal is the most frequently afleeted by this disease. This, however, there can be little doubt, is an erroneous opinion. H. Smith has examined 98 specimens of stric- ture contained in the different London museums ; of these he found only 21 seated in the membranous portion of the m’ethra, whilst 77 were anterior to the triangular ligament; the majority of these being either in the bulbous portion of the urethra, or a little in advance of this. Sir H. Thompson, in his excellent work on Stricture, states that, in an examination of 320 strictures, he found 215 at the junction of the spongy and membranous portions of the urethra; 51 in the spongy portion, from an inch in front of its commencement to within two inches and a half of the external meatus ; and 54 at the external orifice, or within two inches and a half of it. The part most fi’equently affected is the first inch of the spongy portion; in the membranous portion, strictm-e is extremely rare. He also states, “ I may confidently assert that there is not a single case of stricture in the prostatic portion of the urethra to be found in any one of the public museums of London, Edinbiugh, or Paris.” Occa- sionally strictures are multiple, two frequently occm’ring, and sometimes as many as four or five. Characters.—The characters of organic strictm-e vary greatly. In some cases it is annular, encircling the whole of the canal, and occasionally for some little distance. The elongated annular stricture usually arises from consohdation of the corpus spongiosum by plastic matter compressing the urethra, as in Fig. 797. In other cases, again, annular strictiues may be narrow and sharp-edged, and are then called “pack-thread” or “bridle” strictures ; consisting of bands stretching across the luethra (Fig. 798). Sometimes there are several of these in close proximity to one another, leaving merely narrow passages between or under them. These bands occasionally stretch directly across the canal, but at Fig. 797.—Stricture from Con- solidation of Corpus Spon- giosum. Fig. 798.—Bridle-Stricture. Fig. 799.—Stricture at the An- terior part of the Uretlira.SYMPTOMS OF ORGANIC STRICTURE. 891 other times and more commonly they take a somewhat obhque direction (Fig. 79!)). It is not very clear how these bridles or frmna stretching acioss the urethra are formed. It can scarcely be by thq effusion ol plastic matter ; it is more probable that they are occasioned by a valvular projection of the mucous membrane which has been perforated, perhaps by the iwint of the catheter, and thus has had apertures produced in it. These various kinds of organic stricture are haixl and elastic; sometimes, when old, almost cartilaginous in their density, feeling gristly and rough to the instrument that passes over them. Amount of Constriction.—varies greatly in organic stricture, from merely slight narrowing of the channel to almost complete obstruction of it. A question has arisen whether the canal of the urethra is ever rendered com- pletely impermeable by a stricture. In answering this, it is necessary to be agreed upon the meaning of the term ‘impermeable.” If by it be meant impenetrable to the passage of a catheter, there can be no doubt that such strictures may occasionally, though very rarely, occur ; the channel being so naiTow, oblique, or tortuous, that the instrument cannot be passed through it. Strictures, however, of this description may usually be ultimately made per- , meable to instruments by proper and careful treatment. If by “impermeable” is meant generally impervious to the passage of urine, there can be no doubt that such a condition does not exist. It would clearly be incompatible with life, unless a fistidous opening existed behind the stricture, through which the urine might pass out; and, even wdth such an aperture existing, I have never heard of or seen a case in which no urine whatever escaped by the meatus, unless in consequence pf injury or disease a portion of the whole calibre of the urethra had sloughed awny ; and it is clear that, so long as any urine passes out in this way, a stricture cannot be looked upon as truly impermeable. Mechanical Results.—When an organic stricture is once formed, it will continue unless removed by surgical means ; and, as it usually becomes more closely contracted, it will offer an increasing obstacle to the free flow of the urine, and thus eventually tend to give rise to important structm'al changes in the ininary apparatus. The urethra behind it becomes increased in diameter, sometimes dilated into a true pouch, in which sabulous masses, and even small calculous concretions occasionally collect. The Madder, subjected to increased pressure by the necessity of overcoming the obstacle to the passage of the urine, becomes thickened, fasciculated, and contracted. The ureters are often found dilated, from a tendency to a reflux of the urine, or to compression of their vesical orifices, in consequence of the altered structure of the bladder. The ^oelves of the hidneys become the seat of chronic suppuration; and the kidneys them- selves become irritated, congested, and at last the seat of some of those vai'ious secondary changes which have been fully described in Chapter LXVII. Symptoms.—TAiQ amount of constitutional distinbance set up by a stricture will vary greatly in different cases. In many, and indeed in most instances, it is not VC17 great. The extent to which the constitution is influenced will pnerally be in proportion to the tightness and duration of the stricture ; but it is surprising how much constitutional in-itation is set up in some systems by <a stricture, even though it be not very tight. The interference ivith the free892 DISEASES OF THE DUET HR A. flow of the urine causes in-itation of the bladder and kidneys, the secretion fi-om which becomes less abundant than usual; in consequence of this, the actions of the skin and other depurative organs are deranged, and thus the system at largo is influenced and sufters. In other cases, again, the constitu- tional symptoms are rather of a nervous character; the patient suffering not only gi’eat pain in micturition, but being seized with rigors, followed by neivous prostration, each time the urine flows over the tender and irritable surface. ihe Local Sic/ns of stricture are ahvays well marked, are very unequivocal, and are dependent simply on the mechanical obstacle presented by the con- tracted urethra to the free escape of the urine. The disease usually com- mences with the retention in the urethra of a few drops of urine after evacua- tion of the contents of the bladder ; these escape and wet his clothes. The patient finds that he has to pass urine more frequently than usual, particularly at night; there is some straining, perhaps a slight gleety discharge, and a feeling of weakness about the genital organs. The stream of urine has changes impressed upon it diming its passage through the stricture, by ivhich its shape and direction are modified ; thus, it may become forked, scattered, twisted, fan-like, or be discharged in a double ciuTent—one projected directly forwards, the other dropping perpendicularly downwards. As the disease advances, these signs necessarily become more marked, imtil they may termi- nate in complete retention ; they, however, often come on in a yery insidious manner, and when the patient seeks advice he is found to be already the subject of a very tight and intractable stricture ; indeed, in some cases, the fii'st circumstance that directs the attention of the patient to his complaint is the sudden occurrence of retention of urine. Examination of the Urethra.—The existence of strictime can be deter- mined with certainty only by the introduction of an instrument down the urethra. In exploring the canal in a suspected case, two points have to be ascertained— the existence of a stricture, and its degree of tightness. The existence of a stricture may be determined by passing a plated steel sound, or a silver catheter of medium size, about Ho. 8, well oiled and warmed. This will readily pass as far as the constricted point, but wiU then be arrested. In this exploration, too small an instrument must not be used, lest it hitch in the fossm of the urethra or against the verumontanum, and this accidental arrest be mistaken for the obstruction produced by the stricture ; or it may pass through the stricture, and thus mislead the Simgeon. The existence of a strictime having been ascertained, the next point is to determine its degree of tightness. This is best done by withdrawing the instrument previously used, and then introducing a smaller one about the size of the stream of urine that the patient passes. If this fail to enter the strictme, a smaller one stiU must be used, until that size is reached, which can be introduced with but a moderate • degree of force. In this way the existence, the seat, and degree of tightness of ' the stricture, are ascertained. The tact of an experienced Surgeon will also lead him to judge to a certain extent of the length, degxee of indmation, &c., ot the constriction. The slighter narrowings of the nrethra ai’e most easily recognised by means of the conical or olive-headed sound (Figs. 800, 801). The conical shape oftreatment of organic stricture. 893 this instrument enables it to pass readily drawino- it the shoulder hitches on any nan-ow pait The mstiument should be gi-aduatcd in inches, so that the exact distance of the stricture ftom the orifice can be readily determined. If it be desired to recognise more acciu'ately the seat of the stricture, the distance of the orifice of the bladder from the meatus externns must fii-st be determined by carefully passing a graduated catheter d l)Oule, and noting the exact moment at which the urine commences to flow. The graduated olive-headed sound is then passed, and slowly withdrawn. If the hitch or cling be felt between one inch and one and three-quarters, the stricture is in the mem- branous part. If between one and three-quarters and three inches, it is in the bulbous portion. For the purpose of measuring these slight stric- tures, Otis, of New York, has invented an instru- ment which he calls the “urethrometer ” (Fig. 802). It consists of a straight tube, the end of which can be dilated into a sort of fenestrated sphere, and the size to which it is dilated is registered on a small dial on the handle. The instrument can be readily introduced into the bladder if necessary, but there is no advantage in so doing. When in the urethra. Fig. SOO.— Conical-heacled Sound. Fig. SOI.— Olive-headed Sound. behind the stricture, the bulb is gradually expanded till it is just held, but not tightly gvasped. It is then drawn steadily forward, and when it is stopped the bulb is gradually diminished till it passes the stricture. The exact size of each part is thus registered on the dial. The employment of soft wax bougies has been recommended with the view of taking a mould of the size, shape, and direction of the stricture, by pressing the end of the instrument into it; but no possible advantage can be derived from this proceeding, and a Surgeon accustomed to the use of metallic instru- ments can obtain all this information with more certainty by the finer touch afforded by them. Treatment.—The treatment of organic stricture of the urethra may be con- ducted by the following methods :—1, Gradual Mechanical Dilatation ; 2, Con- tinuous Dilatation; 3, Caustics; 4, Forcible Expansion or Rupture; o. Internal Urethrotomy ; 6, External Urethrotomy or Perinmal Section. What- ever plan of treatment be adopted, the Surgeon must bear in mind that his operations have to be conducted upon a tender canal endowed with exquisite^94 DISEASES OF THE URETHRA. sensibility,'Which sympathises closely with the conditions of the general system, and in which improper violence or too active measures may set np a degree of irritation that will readily extend to neighbouring structures, and thus jeopar- dise the life of the patient. But, though it is necessary to recollect all this, he must not run into the opposite and equally dangerous extreme of adopting 1 inefheient measures for the removal of the obstruction. A bad stricture 5. one of the most serious diseases to which the human frame is liable, and will almost inevitably, if left to itself, terminate fatally by the induction of renal disease, or of serious local complications. We must therefore not hesitate to adopt sufficiently energetic measimes for its removal; and if these be properly conducted, there is scarcely any affection in which the Surgeon can afford his. patient greater relief than in this. At the same time, however, that local means are being used, constitutional treatment should not be neglected. Organic stricture is often more or less associated with a spasmodic or a con- gestive condition of the urethra, and requires the same constitutional treat- ment, modified according to circumstances, that is necessary in these affections —proper regulation of diet, avoidance of all articles of food that generate lithates, and care not to allow the urine to become too concentrated. Attention to the maintenance of the healthy action of the Liver and skin will also tend much to increase the patient’s comfort, and to ward off the more serious consequences of strictiu’e. In all except the slightest cases of stricture it is advisable, before beginning mechanical treatment, to subject the patient to constitutional remedies to diminish as far as possible the congestion and spasm which may be present. If j any serious difficulty be anticipated, and if the ckcumstances of the patient | permit it, he should be confined to bed for a day or more. The bowels should be freely opened, and he should sit for some time in a hot hip-bath, morning and evening. An opium or morphia suppository may be administered at night, and if the signs of congestion be well marked, a few leeches may be applied to the perimsum. Occasionally blisters over the seat of strictm-e, when it can be clearly felt from without, may be of service. By these means alone, a strictine j which at fii’st seemed almost impermeable may be so far reheved as to take a | No. 4 or 5 catheter'. | 1. Crradnal Mechanical Dilatation, as it is eiToneously termed, is the j usual and certainly the most successful mode of treating ordinary strictures ; but it is not the mere stretching or forcible dilatation of the stricture that | cures it. The means employed to produce dilatation tend to promote the absorption of those plastic matters effused in and underneath the mucous membrane, which especially constitute the stricture, and thus to occasion a permanent cure. The instruments that are used for dilatation are either metafile, such as silver catheters, steel sounds, plated or pewter bougies; or made of some , soft and yielding material, as gum-elastic catheters, catgut, wax, or elastic bougies. Though each Siugeon wifi mostly prefer one kind of instrument tO' another, it is well not to be too exclusive in the use of any one ; for it vifi be found in particular strictui’es and certain constitutions that it is advan- tageous to depart from the ordinary practice, and that the Sm'geon ma} modify with great benefit to his patient the mechanical means that he adopts.INTRODUCTION OF CATHETERS AND SOUNDS. 895 \.s a o-eneral rule, I think that metallic instruments are decidedly preferable, more especially in the early stages of the treatment, and Avhen the stricture is tight, cartilaginous, and of old standing. In such cases, nothing will pass so reachly as a well-made steel sound or silver catheter. But, when once dilata- tion has been carried up to a certain point, for instance, to the introduction of a No. 5 catheter, then some of the other and softer instruments may often be advantageously substituted for the metal one. The shape and curve of Catheters and Sounds is of much importance ; the best curve for these instruments, I think, consists of one-fourth of the circumference of a circle 4^ inches in diameter. If sounds be used, they should be made slightly conical, so that there may be a difference of about three numbers between the point and the thickest part, which corresponds to the bend of the instrument. They should be well rounded at the point. Sounds are particularly useful Avhen the stricture will admit a moderate-sized instru- meut. The sound should have a broad metallic handle, which transmits any sensation commiuiicated to the point more acciu’ately than a wooden one. If a catheter be used—and this instrument is most applicable in small stric- tures, in which, if the difficulty of introduction be great, it may advan- tageously be left—it should be made very solid and stiff. The rings should be large, so as to serve for a handle, and the eyes well rounded off and somewhat depressed, so that they may not scrape the urethra. These instru- ments should be used mth every possible care and gentleness; but, though no one more strongly recognises than I do the necessity of not employing unnecessary violence in their introduction, it is useless to think of passing through a tight hard stricture without the employment of some degree of force. The catheter or sound wiU not “ find its own way” here as it may in a healthy urethra, but it must be guided and directed by the hand of the Surgeon ; and there is scarcely an operation in surgery that requires more tact and delicacy of manipulation than that of passing an instrument through a tight, or, as it is termed, an impermeable stricture. Here some force must be used, but the skiU is shown in proportioning this to the amount of resistance, and in using it in a proper direction. The appearance of force is indeed often greater than the reality; for, though the point of the catheter have passed through a tight strictiu’e, it may still require considerable pressure to push the rest of the instrument through it. Introduction.—Catheters and sounds are best introduced by laying the patient flat upon his back, with the pelvis somewhat raised, and the head and shoulders low. The Sm’geon, standing on the left side, inserts the instrument well warmed and oiled into the urethra, with its concavity turned towards the left gi’oin, and passes it down the canal, at the same time drawing the penis upwards with his left hand, so as to put the mucous membrane on the stretch. As the instrument approaches the triangular ligament, the handle is can’ied to the mesial line, and at the same time raised perpendicularly ; aud, as its poiut passes under the pubes, it should be kept well against the upper surface of the urethra, and made to enter the bladder by depressing the handle towards and between the thighs. The surest guide to the bladder is the upper surface of the urethra, which is more fixed than the lower, and less liable to the existence of fistulous openings or false896 DISEASES OF THE URETHRA. passages. Should difficulty be experienced, the introduction may be facilitated by injecting and slightly distending the uretlira with olive oil before passing the instrument. If the stricture be not only very tight, but twisted, it inay be somewhat difficult to get a metallic instrument through ; and then the plan recommended by Brodie may be advantageously employed. This consists in taking a fine catgut bougie, and bending it, as repre- sented in rig. 808, about an inch from the point, so as to follow the track of the stricture more closely. In this way, strictures that are otherwise impassable may be rendered pervious with comparative ease. Under the influence of chloroform, however, many strictures may be readily passed with metallic instruments that are not pervious in any other way. The Surgeon repeatedly Cc t^'°t Bou U passing catheters through very tight stric- iihit to Shape tures, which had been impenetrable for months or years without of stricture. , . , this agent. Gum-elastic bougies and catheters, and wax bougies, are not as a rule so manageable as metallic instruments, as they may bend back against tight organic strictiues. In those of a spasmodic and congestive kind, however, in Avhich a large instrument will readily pass, they are of much service. They are usually best introduced whilst the patient is standing, and they generally o-lide most readily into the bladder if they have been slightly curved before being passed. When they are of wax, it is useful to smooth them down between the fingers before introducing them. In using the elastic catheter, a stylet is usually requued; but in some cases the instrument ajipears to enter more easily without. In others, it may be passed with the stylet doivn to the strictm'e ; and then, on partially withdravdng it, the point of the catheter will start up, and thus more readily slip in. Soft conical bougies and catheters with a lulbous end are often extremely useful (Figs. 804: and 805). Their introduction excites far less irritation and pam, with much less likelihood of bleeding fr’om a congested mucous membrane. Fig. S04.—Conical Bulbous Bougie. than does that of metallic or even gum-elastic instruments. ^ It is, of com-se, quite impossible to make a false passage with them; and in most cases of ordinary strictm-e they wiU be found to be the safest and most agreeable in- Fig. 805.—Conical Bulbous Catlieter. struments to use.

The soft tapering end will frequently insinuate itself along an irritable urethra, and through a spasmodic and congestive stricture, with the greatest possible ease and comfoit. Results of Introduction of an Instrument.—The introduction of an instniment usually gives rise to a smarting, painful sensation in the urethra ; this is generally most severe as the point approaches the neck of the bladder, and is then sometimes attended by nausea and sudden fexintness. As a general rule, the instrument should be passed every second or third day, and when introduced should be left in for about five minutes, or until the spasm of the urethra induced by its introduction has subsided. If, however, the stricture be extremely tight, a very small catheter only having been in- troduced, the instrument may be left in for twenty-four or forty-eight hours, when it vail be found that, however tightly grasped it originally had been, it has become loosened; a shght discharge being at the same time set up from the urethi-a. It may then be readily withdraxvn, and, w'hen the iiTitation has subsided at the end of a couple of days, a considerably larger one may be introduced. The augmentation of the size of the instrumeut should be very gradual. It is fuUy sufficient to increase it by one number at each time of introduction. Many urethrae vdU not bear even this, and it becomes necessary to pass the same instrument on two or three successive occasions before a larger size can be introduced. The size of the instrument may be gradually increased until that is reached which the m-ethral orifice readily admits ; beyond this, the Sm’geon should not go ; but so soon as the full size, usually No. 12 or 14, can be introduced with ease, it should not be passed so frequently as before ; once a week or ten days, and gradually with less frequency. But for some length of time it will be necessary to introduce it at least once a month or six weeks, lest contraction take place again. If the size of the instrument be increased too rapidly, indtation may be set up, and inflammation of the testicles, and abscess in the perinmum or prostate, induced. I have more than once had occasion to regret being in too much haste to increase the size of the instrument; and, by augmenting it by two or three numbers at one sitting, have seen the patient thrown back for weeks by the supervention of some of the affections just mentioned. By gradual dilatation, properly carried out, most strictiu’es may be con- siderably reheved in the com-se of a few weeks ; and the majority may be cured by continuing the treatment for a sufficient length of time. Some, however, cannot be cured in this way ; it would appear that the tissue of which they are composed is so contractile that, although they may be ex- panded up to a certain size—say up to No. 5 or G—it is impossible to go beyond this. In other cases there is a great tendency to relapse, and to a return of the constriction ; the stricture rapidly becoming tighter so soon as the introduction of the instruments is discontinued, even though it be dilated to the full size of the urethra, up to No. 12 catheter, for instance. In some instances the relapse is almost instantaneous, mictmdtion being as difficult as before as soon as the catheter is withdrawn. In these cases recourse must be had to other measures, which will be described. Accidents attending CATiiETERisji.-The introduction of instruments VOL, II,DISEASES OF THE URETHRA. 898 occcasionally gives rise to certain troublesome and even dangerous sequences. Amongst these, syncope and rigors, hmmorrhage, and inflammatory in-itation about the urethra or testes, are the most common. Rigors.—In some persons there is a great tendency to the occurrence of shivering and faintness during the passage of an instrument, more particularly as it approaches the neck of the bladder. These effects usually go off after the 'withdrav'al of the catheter, but in some cases they may continue for many hours, or even come on after the lapse of some time, perhaps as late as the following day, more especially if the patient have been exposed to cold. The rigors in these circumstances are very severe and intermitting, so much so as to resemble an ague-fit. During the rigor the temperature rises considerably, often to 104° or 105°. The subsidence of the rigor is marked by profuse sweating, and is usually attended by great exhaustion. This occun-ence is always very alarming, and, although usually not attended by positive danger, yet leaves the patient weak and exhausted ; and if he be old, of broken constitution, or the subject of chronic urmmia consequent on kidney-disease, a fatal result may rapidly ensue. In these distressing cases, death may occur at different periods and in different ways. The earhest period at which I have seen a fatal termination has been in nine hours ; usually it takes place in from 24 to 48 hours after the occurrence of the first rigor. The cause of death may be coma, exhaustion, or cardiac syncope. The cause of the occurrence of these rigors and sweatings is exceedingly obsciu’e. Constitutional nervousness or timidity has certainly nothing to do with them. I have seen them occiu’ in the strongest and most courageous men, and they very rarely follow the use of the catheter in women. I have only once seen these effects in the female. That was in the person of a young married lady, strong and healthy, who had a strictm’e of the orifice of the urethra, which I dilated by a two-bladed dilator. Twenty hoius after the operation, she had three most intense rigors followed by profuse sweatings. In men they may occur after dilatation of any part of the urethra, but are most frequent after deep dilatation, possibly because the deeper portions of the canal are more commonly strictured. I have, however, heard of one case in which a fatal ri°'or followed incision and dilatation of the orifice of the urethra. I o doubt whether these rigors occur unless there have been some lesion, abrasion, or rupture of the mucous membrane of the urethra. Eigors certainly follow the use of metalhc instruments more frequently than that of the softer kinds. They more frequently occur in old cases of stricture, and are probably then dependent on a chronic urmmic state. In this condition Ave know that the neiwous system readily becomes affected—that coma or conA’ulsions easily occm; and it is in this state that the additional irritation inflicted on the urinary organs by the use of an instrument developes the rigor. The Treatment consists in Avrapping the patient up in blankets, with hot bottles to the feet, and giAung hot brandy-and-water, and full doses of quinme Avith citrate of potash and mucilage frequently repeated. ^ 'When there is a tendency to rigors, it is Avell to giA'c a full dose of quinine immediately on the Avithdrawal of the instrument, as a preventive means. Hemorrhage, Avhich is sometimes rather profuse, may follow the introduc- tion of a catheter, especially if the stricture be congestiA'e, and the instrumentFALSE PASSAGES. 899 employed small. It generally ceases of itself; but, if it be troublesome, the application of cold will check it. The Inflammation about the urethra and in the testes that occasionally occurs during the treatment of stricture, is best guarded against by not using too large catheters, and by directing the patient to abstain from much exercise during the time of their introduction. False Passages are occasioned by the instrument passing out of the urethra through its coats into the surrounding tissues. They are especially apt to occur in tight bridle-strictures, when a small instrument is being used, and more especially if the direction of the constriction be somewhat oblique, so that the point of the sound is thrown against the side of the canal (Fig. 798). The extent and situation of a false passage necessarily vary according to the position of the stricture ; and the danger is usually in proportion to its depth. The false passage usually takes a direction downwards and to one side of the lu-ethra. If the stricture be far forward, it may run along the corpus spon- giosum ; but if it be iu the usual situation, it may perforate the lateral lobe of the prostate, or run between this and the rectum, being unable to extend upwards on account of the rigid nature of the structures in this situation, TVTien the false passage merely perforates the corpus spongiosum, running parallel to the urethra, and opening again into the canal, or when, perforating a portion of the prostate, it enters the bladder, it is not necessarily attended with much dauger ; but when it enters the areolar tissue between the bladder and the rectum, breaking up this structure to a great extent, admitting urine into the recto-vesical space and about the neck of the bladder, then the most serious consequences, such as inflammation and abscess in this neighbourhood, are apt to ensue, which may not unlikely be followed by the death of the patient. At the moment when a false passage is made during the introduction of an instrument, by the Surgeon using too much force or pressing in the wrong direction, he feels the point make a sudden slip, which the direction of the shaft indicates to be to one side of the urethra. The patient complains of severe pain, and is often conscious of a laceration ; there is a grating or rough sensation communicated by the tissues against which the instrument has passed ; and though it have entered deeply, it will be found not to have reached the bladder. On the Surgeon introducing his Anger into the rectum, he probably feels the point of the instrument in the areolar tissue between the gut and the bladder ; on -withdrawing it, it will be found covered -with blood, and there will be free hmmorrhage from the urethra. The Surgeon knows when he has entered an old false passage by the change that takes place in the direction of the instrument, by its not reaching the bladder, and by the rough sensation communicated to it, very different fr'om that afforded by the smooth lining of the urethra. The patient is often con- scious of the existence and of the entry of the instrument into the false passage, and will warn the Surgeon of it. ’ If the Surgeon be aware that he has made a false passage, he should, if possible, at the time of the accident pass a large catheter into the bladder, and leave it there for a few days until the laceration has healed. If there l)e an old false passage he must be careful, by keeping the point of the instru- 3 M 2900 DISEASES OF THE URETHRA. mcnt away from it, not to enter it, lest during the introduction of the catheter ho raise with the point of the instrument the valvular angle that intervenes between it and the urethra ; every time that this is opened up it tends to lessen the chance of a closure of the aperture, whilst, overlapping the urethra, it interferes with the onward passage of the instrument into the bladder. By withdiaiving the instrument and changing its direction, the false passage may often be aA'oided, and the bladder reached. Should there have been much difficulty in introducing the catheter, the better plan Avill be to alloiv it to remain in the bladder for two or three days, when the false canal may possibly close. It has already been stated that, in certain forms of strictm-e, gradual dilata- tion does not succeed in effecting a permanent cure. In these cases four plans of treatment have been recommended—continuous dilatation, the de- struction of the stricture by caustic, forcible dilatation, and its division by the knife. These methods will now be described. 2. Continuous Dilatation is merely a modification of the preceding mode of treatment, and is useful only in very tight organic strictures. A small instrument is first passed and tied in. In from twelve to twenty-four hours, although it may at first have been tightly grasped, the catheter will be found to be quite loose, and urine will escape beside it. It must now be changed for a larger one. In doing this, the fr-esh instrument shoidd be ready, so that the moment one is removed the other may be introduced. A neglect of this pre- caution, especially when false passages are present, may seriously increase the difficulty of passing the fresh catheter. By the second day a shght discharge Avill be found to have been set up from the inethra. The treatment should be continued till the urethra reaches the size of No. 5 or 6, which it wiU do in a few days at most, after which it is not necessary. The catheter may be closed with a small Avooden plug, so that the patient can draw off his own urine, or, better still, an India-rubber tube may be attached so as to drain the bladder. In cases in which a gum-elastic catheter cannot be passed, a small siNer one may be tied in, and replaced by a gum-elastic at the first change. When nothing but a filiform whalebone or catgut bougie has been passed, it may still be tied in, as the urine aaoII usually find its Avay beside it even when it seems to be tightly grasped ; and in twelve hours or more it may, in most cases, be changed for a fine gum-elastic catheter. This plan of treatment is of great use in cases in which considerable difficulty is found in introducing the instrument, but it has the disadvantage of being extremely liable to set up cystitis. If the treat- ment be continued beyond three days, the mine will almost always be found to be alkaline; and this is scarcely to be wondered at AA'hen we consider the Avay in Avhich the bladder is, as it were, opened up to the air. The risk of cystitis is much diminished by draining the bladder, as then no mine is left to decom- pose, and the mere contact of the soft instrument Avith the Avails of the bladder seems to cause but little irritation by itself. In rare cases, sloughing of the urethra may take place at the seat of stricture, leading to perineal abscess. A case of this kind occmred not long ago in University College Hospital. 3. Caustics.—In the treatment of stricture by caustics, two objects are endeavoured to be attained ; the first is the destruction of the strictme ; the second, the diminution of the sensibility of the surrounding mucous membrane.FORCIBLE EXPANSION. 9°i so that the irritability and spasm of the canal may be lessened. Ihe foUowing is the way in which the caustic is applied. A wax bougie, well oiled, is passed do^vn to, but not through the stricture ; the Surgeon then, with the thumb- nail makes a notch on that portion of the instrument opposite to the meatus. Another bougie of similai- lengtli and size is then armed by a piece of potassa fiisa about the size of a small pin’s head, placed in a depression at its end. A mark is now made on it, at a point corresponding to the notch on the fii-st bougie ; it is then passed rapidly down until this mark comes oppo- site to the meatus, and pressed firmly for two or three minutes apinst the stricture, upon which the caustic exercises its action. This application, which is followed by a gleety discharge, is to be repeated every second or third day until a bougie of proper size can be introduced ; and then the dilatation may be proceeded with in the usual way. This practice, stigmatised, not unjustly, by Liston as “ most atrocious,” has now but few advocates ; and, indeed, there appears to be nothing useful effected by it, beyond what can be accomplished much more safely and easily by a catheter or sound in an ordinarily skilful hand. 4. rorcible Expansion or Rupture.—Forcible and rapid dilatation caus- ing the expansion and rupture of the stricture, is a method that, originally proposed and practised many years since by Luxmoor, Arnott, and Buchanan of Glasgow, has of late years been revived in principle, and ingeniously modi- fied in detail, by many Surgeons, amongst whom Eeybard, Maisonneuve, Perreve, Wakley, Holt, and Thompson are the most conspicuous. However varied the means by which strictures are thus treated, the instruments em- ployed may be aivanged in three groups : a. Those that act as sliding tubes ; A Those that expand by a screw mechanism ; and c. Those that act on the principle of a wedge. a. Slidinfj Tiibes were first employed in the treatment of stricture by Desault at the close of the last century, subsequently by various French Surgeons, and of later years by Hutton of Dublin, and very extensively and successfully by Wakley. The mode of appheation of these tubes is as follows. Along conductor is introduced through the stricture into the bladder, and over this a catheter, either of gum or silver, is passed, which in its turn is made to serve as a con- duetor to a larger one. In Wakley’s instrument the conductor, or “ m’ethral guide,” consists of a small silver catheter, which, after being passed through the stricture, has a long steel rod screwed into it. Over this a silver tube is passed, which in its tmm is made to serve as a conductor ; and thus the conductor may be rapidly dilated by passing one tube over another until a full size is reached. The only difficulty in this very ingenious method—which is, however, common to it and cveiy other plan of treating stricture by dilatation—consists in the first introduction of the “ urethral guide ; ” when that has once passed through the stricture, the tubes must follow as a matter of necessity. They cannot pos- sibly go wrong ; and, as no laceration or rupture of the stricture is, or can be, effected by the instrument, it appears to be a peculiarly safe means of employing rapid dilatation when circumstances seem to require it. b. The method of forcibly expanding a stricture by the introduction into it of a small two- or four-bladod instrument, fashioned somewhat like a narrow beaked sound, and which, by Screiu Mechanism in the handle, admits of being902 DISEASES OF THE URETHRA. opened out so as to stretch the stricture to an extent corresponding to the dis- tance at which the blades are screwed apart, has many advocates; and various ingenious contrivances have been invented to efiect this object. More than half Fig. 800.—Tlioiiiiison’s Stricture-Exiiauder. a centiuy ago, Luxmoor attempted it by the use of a four-bladed instrument. Subsequently, Civiale invented a stricture-expander; and of late years two- bladed instruments, having this end in view, have been introduced into practice by Perreve, Lyon, and H. Thompson. The accompanying di’awing (Fig. 80G) is a representation of the instrument used by the latter Sm’geon ; it answers admirably the intended purpose, the expansion of the blades being effeeted by a screw worked by turning the handle. This should be done very slowly, several seconds being allowed to elapse between each tmm of the handle, so that the tissue composing the stricture may be gradually stretched, and the canal of the urethra at the seat of stricture dilated beyond the full size, so as to be over-stretched ; the extent of dilatation may be carried up to 16 or 18, and is marked on a scale attached to the handle of the instrument. If this operation be done slowly, httle if any bleeding results, and there is no evidence of laceration of the wall of the urethra at the strictiu’ed spot. A large gum- elastic catheter may then be passed, and the urine drawn off. It is not usually necessary to leave the catheter in the bladder, though there can be no objection to doing this for forty-eight hours, after which the patient may have one passed occasionally in order to maintain the dilatation. c. The rupture or splitting of the stricture by an instrument acting on the principle of a Wedge, has been recommended by Eeybard, adopted by Holt, and very extensively employed by the latter excellent Surgeon. The instru- ment used by him is represented in the accompanying figure (Fig. 807). It consists of two grooved metallic blades joined at the extremity. Between Fig. 807.—Holt's Instrument for Splitting Strictures. these a tube is slipped along a wire, which in its descent separates the blades at a considerable angle, and thus sphts up the stricture. In this way the contracted part of the urethra is at once enlarged to its normal diameter, so as to admit a full-sized catheter, by which the urine is then drawn off. ihe introduction of the catheter should be had recourse to at first on alternate days, and afterwai'ds at longer intervals. Holt believes that the effects of the dilatation are entirely confined to the morbid contraction, the healthy portion of the urethra not being injuriously disturbed by the expansion of t e instrument (see page 746). _ • i • „ Berkeley Hill has invented a modification of the dilators preMOusly in useINTERNAL URETHROTOMY. 9°3 which pi-eseiits sCYcml advantages. Ho thus describes it. “ The instmmcnt consists of a split sound, wliich equals in calibre a No. 2 or 3 catheter, ihc halves of the split sound ean ho separated by passing between them a wedge fixed on a slender stem. The w^odge is prevented by two dovetail gi-ooves at its hinder pai-t, from loa^'ing the sound which acts as a guide diu’mg the passage of the wedge down the m-ethi-a.” “ The advantages claimed for this instrument are : simplicity of construction ; the central guide of Holt’s in- strument is not needed, hence the split sound can be passed through naiTOwei strictures. Next and chiefly, diminution of resistance, and consequently the more immediate application of the rupturing force—the wedge—to the impedi- ment to be overcome. The force needed to push Holt s dilator is sometimes very great, and the attempt has been abandoned, or the instrument has broken, evenTn skilful hands, from this cause. ]\Iuch of the force is expended on the continuous friction outside the tube along the spht sound, and inside along the guide. In the wedge-dilator the friction-surface is reduced to two dovetail grooves, which together do not exceed half an inch. For this, the force reqiiu’ed is so small that one haild suffices to overcome the resistance. The instrument can, if requhed, be adapted to a conducting sound, such as is described afterwai’ds under Internal Urethrotomy. 4. Division of the Stricture may be practised either from luithin the . urethra, or from tviiliout, through the perina3um. Internal Urethrotomy.—The division from ivitMn may be performed in two Avays ; either by cutting through the stricture fr’om before backwards, or by passing a proper instrument through it, and dividing it from behind forwards. The first operation—that of perforating the stricture/rom lefore l)achwards— may be performed by passing a concealed steel stylet doivn to the strictme, and then pushing forwards the lancet-like Imife, attempting to perforate the obstruc- tion. This plan is necessarily attended by the most dangerous consequences, if an attempt be made to thrust a stylet through the strictm’e without a guide ; the probability, indeed almost the certainty, being that the j^ointed cutting blade win pass by the strictme and divide the healthy wall of the urethra. It is, indeed, almost banished from surgical practice, and is only applicable with safety to those strictures that are situated in the part of the methra anterior to the scrotum, where the canal is straight. In the deeper and more cm’ved parts, any attempt at perforation would obviously be fr-aught with danger; for, as it would of course be impossible for the Smgeon to guide the stylet exactly in the direction of the urethra, it would be more likely to perforate the Avails of this canal than to pass through the stricture. In hard and resisting con- Fig. 80S.—L.ancetted Stylet for Division of Strictoe. tractions, hoAvever, in the sti’aight portion of the canal anterior to the scrotum, such an instrument may occasionally be used Avith advantage.

On the other hand, the operation of cuttmg^ from behind forwards could not, until recently, be performed unless the stricture was capable of admitting a No. 5 at least. The Surgeons to whom we are most indebted for improvements in the instruments employed, are Van Bureii, Gouley, and Otis of New York, Maisonneuve of Paris, and Berkeley Hill of London. The objects which these Surgeons have had in view have been, first, to provide a safe and certain guide for a small cutting instrument to the bladder, and secondly, so far to diminish the size of the instruments as to make them available for strictures not capable of taking more than a No. 1 catheter. Lastly, as it was found that the great mobility of the m-ethra ren- dered it difficult in many cases to divide the stricture, a combination of stretching and cutting was introduced by Otis, which greatly facfiitates the operation. The guide to the bladder may be obtained in two ways. A fine whalebone bougie having been passed through the stricture, the urethrotome may be so constructed by being tumieUed for a short distance at its point, as to shde Fig. S09.—Otis’s Dilator and Uretlirometer. over this into the bladder. Or a better plan is the employment of Maison- iieuve’s sonde conductrice, or conducting sound. This is a very fine gum- elastic bougie, provided with a male screw at the end (Fig. 809, a). This is first passed on till it is sujiposed to be in the bladder. A small catheter corres- ponding to a No. 1, having a female screw at its extremity, is then screwed on and passed onwards, while the small conducting sound coils up in the bladder. If the mine flow, it is then certain that the conducting sound has passed in the proper direction. It is now withdrawn again, the conducting sound being left in position. The catheter is now replaced by the urethrotome, which screws in the same way. Berkeley HiU has invented a very ingenious urethi’otome for cutting fi’om behind forwards, in which a very fine knife can be protruded from an instrument not larger than a No. 2. Another instru- ment invented by the same Surgeon for cutting from before backwards is represented in Fig. 810. It combines the principles of several others, and has been foimd to ivork most successfully. It is thus employed. The conducting soimd having been passed and ascertained to be in the bladder, the female screwINTERNAL URETHROTOMY, 9°5 b is applied to the male screw a, and the instrument passed through the strictme. The blades * and h, when closed, about equal a No. S catheter in size. The point b is about equal to a Ivo. 1. The instrmnent having been passed, the vedge e, which contains a knife cl concealed in a shield c, is now inserted between the blades and passed steadily do"wn. The blades thus separated stretch and steady the uretlma; and when the stricture is reached, the shield c stops against it and prevents fui-ther progress. The small con- cealed knife d is then protruded by pressing the button at the top of the instrument, and as soon as the finger is removed it is withdrawn again by the spring 1. The wedge can then be passed I on a httle further, and if it hitch again the knife can be again protruded. By this means the urethra is only cut at the points of stricture, and no more wound is made than is absolutely necessary. The incision is always made downwards towards the floor of the urethra. This instrument may be employed in almost any stricture that will admit the conducting sound. In larger strictures Civiale’s urethrotome (Fig. 811) may be used. In order to use this instrument, the stricture must be dilated up to about No. 5. The end of the instrument is then passed beyond it, and, the small blade having been made to project, the stricture is divided or notched domiwards by a firm and steady pressiu’e to the extent usually of about an inch. The blade is then shut into its sheath, and the instrument is withdraum. As this instrument does not steady the luethra, the penis must be pulled forward so as to put it on the stretch before the division is attempted, and this should be done by a steady pressure or a sawing- motion rather than by a sudden effort. ® Dilator and Uretlirotoino. a, Front View ; n, Side View ; c, Conducting Sound fnr H ^ «• for concBoicd knife ; d, knife protruded ; c, wedge Wades 7i, and i; Uie knife is on tlie posterior aspect of the wedge ; g, rod for carrying the taidml’--^/ ^°r regulating tlie distance to wliich the knife can be pro- hiltton oi A /r *^1 ooncealed, except when protruded by pressing the button opposite a and b. (In Fig. b the button should have been represented as depressed )9°6 DISEASES OF THE URETIIliA. After the operation of internal urethrotomy, a full-sized instrument should be immediately passed, but it is not usually necessary to tie it in. It should however, be passed daily for a few days, and after that every second or third Fig. 811.—Civiale’s Uretlirotome. day for three or four weeks. After that, the patient should be taught to pass it for himself, and continue to do so occasionally for some years. The operation of internal luethrotomy is of course only required in excep- tional cases. These are chiefly resilient or very irritable, and some very tough strictures. In resilient strictiues, dilatation fails because the stricture, though admitting of expansion, immediately relapses. In very irritable strictures, the patient cannot bear the pain of dilatation. In some very tough strictm’es, simple dilatation fads, and then internal urethrotomy is required. In aU these cases, the division of the stricture from within removes at once all difficulty in treatment ; and I have of late years employed this very simple method in several cases of this kind with the most marked and permanent success. In fact, in strictiues of the scrotal or penile portions of the luethra, where one or other of the above conditions—resiliency or irritability—generally prevails, I now very commonly notch the constricted portion of the canal by means of Civiale’s urethrotome, and thus at once, and with great ease, obtain most, if not all, the space required. Result.—The risk attending the operation is not great, and diminishes as the strictm’e approaches the orifice of the urethra. It is not, however, abso- lutely free from danger. The accidents that may happen are, perineal abscess, extravasation of mine, haemorrhage, and orchitis; and in some rare cases it may be followed by pysemia. If the kidneys be diseased, it may, like any other operation for strictiue, give rise to fatal acute interstitial nephritis. Perineal abscess usually results from cutting too deeply, so that the knife completely divides the corpus spongiosum. Such abscesses most frequently form beneath the accelerator urinse, and burrow forwards, directed by the expansion of that muscle to the root of the penis. They contain a mixtm’e of mine and pus, but it is rare to find general extravasation into the scrotum. Hiemorrhage also results from cutting too freely. In rare cases, after the operation, a per- manently bent condition of the penis remains dming erection. We possess as yet but few trustworthy statistics of the results of internal urethrotomy, and there is every reason to believe that untoward consequences follow this opera- tion more frequently than some of its advocates are willing to admit. Statis- tics of this operation done in private are worthless ; those of cases occuiTing in Hospital practice scarcely exist. In University College Hospital, where the operation has been extensively practised, I find from the Keports of the Siu- gical Kegistrar that the results are as follows. In 7G cases operated on from 1871 to 1875, there were 4 deaths, one fr’om tubercular disease of kidneys, lungs, &c., one fr’om pleurisy, one from septicaemia, and one fr'om suppurativePERINEAL SECTION. 9°7 1 il i) nephritis. Perineal abscess occim-ed in 8 cases ; extravasation of nrine m 1, and epididymitis in 4. There was htemorrhage in 5, and in 2 the patient was left with permanent chordee during erection. _ i i (For the effects produced on the kidneys by splitting strictures and internal urethrotomy, see Chap. LXVII.). _ .,7 ^ i External Urethrotomy.—The division of the strictm’e from without by incision through the perinteum, may be performed by two distinct operations ; the one being only applicable to those strictures that are pervious to an instrument; the other to those which are impermeable. In the fii-st case a gi’oovcd staff' is passed through the stricture, and the section is made upon this. In the second case, the Surgeon cuts through this and the stricture, Avithout any guidance except such as his anatomical knowledge may afford. Operation for Permeable Stricture.—The first of these operations, introduced by Syme as Ureihrotomij, and commonly called Perineal Section, is comparatively a simple procedure. The instruments required for its performance are a staffs a No. 8 silver catheter, a pointed scalpel, and a broad director. The staff should vary in size from No. 1 to No. 6, according to the tightness of the stricture; it should be grooved along its convexity, either the whole of the way, or better, merely for the lower third (Fig. 812). The stem is smooth and of full size, and joins into the lower grooA’ed pai’t by a distinct shoulder, AA^hich, being passed doAAm as far as the stricture, forms by its projection a guide to that part of the urethra requiring division. In those cases in which there are false passages, a hollow staff' of the same size and shape may be advantageously used; the flow of urine through it indicating with certainty its passage into the posterior part of the uretiu’a. Performance of Perineal Section.—The operation is performed as follows. The staff' having been passed well through the strictm’e, so that the shoulder rests against the upper part of the constriction, the patient is tied up as for lithotomy, and the Surgeon, seating himself in front, pushes the scalpel, Avith the back of the blade doAATiAvards, into the mesial line of the perineum a little above the rectum, and cuts upAvards for an inch or more into the raphe. The dissection is earned on Fig. si2. very carefully exactly in the median line until the staff is fo^erinii 1“ reached, when the knife must be entered into its groove behind the strictm-e, and carried forwards through this. The staff, having been pushed on to ascertain that all is free, must be withdraAvn, and a No. 8 catheter introduced, which is to be kept in for forty-eight hoius ; it must then be taken out, and at the end of eight or ten days the urethra must be dilated by the introduction every second day of a full-sized silver catheter. Urine escapes for some little time by the perineal incision ; but, as this heals by granulation, the floAv^ of fluid gradually lessens and at last ceases entirely. The principal points to be attended to in this operation are— 1. To see that the staff is fairly through the stricture, and to be especially careful in determining this if ffdse passage exist.DISEASES OF THE URETHRA. 9o8 '1. To cut carefully in the median line ; where, as Syme has observed, a kind of septum exists even in the deeper stnicturcs of the porinaBum, and whore there can be no danger whatever of dividing any artery of magnitude, which might happen if any lateral deviation of the knife took place. The only vessel indeed, which is at all endangered, is the artery of the bulb; and this may always be avoided by carefully keeping in the raphe, as it lies towards the side of the incision. 3. To enter the point of the knife behind the strictmu, and to divide that by cutting forwards in the groove of the staff. 4. Not to turn the edge of the knife downwards ; if this be done, the deep perineal fascia may be opened, and danger of pelvic infiltration and inflam- mation incurred. 5. Much difficulty has occasionally arisen in the introduction of the catheter into the bladder after the division of the stricture. This may be avoided by passing a broad director, with the groove turned up, into the posterior part of the lu-ethra after the stricture has been cut, but before the staff is withdrawn. As the catheter is passed down the canal, its point ’\\dll infalhbly be guided by this onwards into the bladder. Where there are more strictures than one, the division of the deepest is usually alone necessary ; the others may be dilated. Result.—The result of the perineal section, so far as the fife of the patient is concerned, is usually satisfactory ; yet cases have not unfrequently ocem-red in which a fatal termination has been the consequence, and there is every reason to believe that these cases have been more numerous than the advocates of this operation have been willing to admit. As yet, there are no trustworthy statistics before the profession that would enable us to speak positively as to the percentage of deaths after this operation. Occasionally, an incurable fistulous opening has been left in the perinteum ; and not unfrequently accidents of a grave though not fatal character, such as inflammatory oedema of the scrotum, abscess in perinteo, &c., have been found to supervene. The whole value of urethrotomy will at last depend on the liability of the stricture to return after its division; and this point has not as yet been by any means satisfactorily determined. The ultimate result of the cases in which it has been practised has not as yet been fully laid before the profession ; and, mi til this has been done, we cannot consider the utihty of the operation as established, except as a means of temporary relief in cases of the kind just mentioned. Much will certainly depend upon keeping up dilatation of the urethi'a for some months after the division of the strictiue, a catheter of full size being passed once in a week or ten days. If this precaution be neglected, relapses will often occur ; and even when it is scrupulously attended to, they are, I believe, by no means unfr’equent. Against luethrotomy it has been argued that, like a wound, the incision into the urethi’a might occasion a cica- trix which would contract, and thus eventually tend still fiu’ther to lessen the ' diameter of the canal. But post mortem examination of patients vho have died some years after this operation had been performed has shown that the idea is groundless, the cicatrix being linear and scarcely perceptible. In fact, there is a great difference in the result, between cases in which the urethra has been divided transversely and those in Avhich it has been incised longitudina y.COMPARISON OF METHODS OF TREATMENT. 909 In the first instance, a dense and contractile cicatricial mass is formed ; in the second case, a linear and scarcely perceptible scar. Comparison of Methods of Treatment.—Gradual dilatation, earned on with patience and gentleness, if need be, on account of the instability of the urethra or the sensitiveness of the patient, with the help of anmsthetics, will suffice for the cure of the vast majority of strictures; and it rarely becomes necessary for a Surgeon who combines patience Avith skill to have recourse to those more scA'cre methods of treatment which have been somewhat unduly extolled and too often unnecessarily practised of late years. The urethra is indeed frequently treated as if it were an inert tube, to AA'hich the various practices of rupture, splitting, forcible dilatation, or incision, could be applied Avith impunity, rather than a highly sensitive canal, A'ery apt to resent, locally or constitutionally, undue violence applied to it. But, AA'hilst we fully recognise this important point, and hold Avith Liston that AA'henever a catheter can be got through a stricture its cure by dilatation is all but certain in the hands of a skilful Surgeon, yet it is undoubtedly the fact that cases do occasionally occur in which simple dilatation fails to effect a cure ; the strictme being highly contractile, and not alloAving expansion beyond a certain point, or relapsing AAffienever the dilating means are removed. In other cases, also, the patient suffers so much pain and irritation whenever an instrument is passed, that he cannot bear the repeated introductions that are necessary, more particularly if the stricture be complicated with fi.stul£e in perin^eo or false passages, which render its cm-e by dilatation tedious and almost impracticable. In such cases as these the Sm-geon, being unable to benefit his patient materially by dilatation, must choose between the employ- ment of jAalliative means or more active measures. It appears to me that there are four classes of cases, in which more energetic means than simple dilatation may not only be advantageously employed, but are absolutely required. 1. Very old dense cartilaginous strictures, often of traumatic origin, which admit an instrument Avith great difficulty, and cannot be dilated beyond a certain point, OAving to the conversion of the lu’ethral structures into a kind of dense, fibrous, almost cicatricial tissue, which neither admits of expansion nor of absoiqjtion by the pressure of instruments ; and in which a considerable extent—half an inch or more—of the urethra is iuA’olved. 2. The same kind of stricture, comj)licated ~^Mhfistidai in the perinmum or scrotum, Avith perhaps considerable plastic infiltration of these parts. In both these classes, I think that the perineal section or external imethrotomy is the preferable operation. 3. Very tight sfrictures, accompanied by excessive sensibility of the urethra ; in which each introduction of the instrument is attended by intense suffering, spasmodic movements of the limbs, and rigors, so that the patient cannot be induced to submit to a proper course of bougies. 4. Very elastic, though perhaps narrow sirichtres, that can be dilated readily enough, even up to the admission of full-sized instruments ; but which, AAffien the treatment is discontinued, immediately begin to contract again, so that the patient is neA'er out of the Surgeon’s hands, and sees no prospect of cure. In these last two classes of cases, I am of opinion that internal urethrotomyDISEASES OF THE TJRET HR A. 910 yith Civiale’s instrument, or the forcible expansion or rupture of the stricture is the best method of treatment; the perineal section being too severe and dangerous, whilst simple dilatation is too feeble a means of treatment. Stricture of the Urethral Orifice is usually the consequence of the destruction of tissue by a phagedaenic chancre. It is apt to become extremely tight, and has a great tendency to relapse. It may be treated in thi’ee ways— 1. By gradual dilatation, by means of short nail-headed styles of graduated sizes. 2. By rapid dilatation. This is best eifected by the introduction of a tube of laminaria, which, swelling up in a few hours, rapidly dilates the stricture. 3. By division with Civiale’s instrument, introduced shut, and cutting as it is withdrawn (Fig. 813). Either of the last two methods may most advantageously be adopted. Impermeable Stricture.—In order to perform the perineal section, the stricture must be pervious to a grooved staff, however small this may be ; and this, it might be supposed, would limit materially the cases.in which the opera- tion can be performed. But complete obliteration of the m’ethra cannot take place except as the result of sloughing, usually from injmy ; indeed “ imper- meable ” strictiu:es, though fi-equently spoken of, are very rarely met with. SjTue, indeed, denied their existence, and stated that, if urine can escape through a strictme, a bougie can be introduced. A Surgeon may often be foiled in his first attempts in passing an instrument through a very tight stricture. But I believe that, with patience, by attention to constitutional treatment, so as to lessen inethral irritation, and especially by the administra- tion of chlorofoim, he will usually at last succeed in making an instrument of some kind pass through the very worst strictures. In the first case in which I performed the perineal section, almost aU the urine had for twelve years been discharged through fistulous openings in the perineeum and scrotum ; and the principal portion escaped through a large hole on the inside of the left thigh, a few drops merely occasionally passing out by the lips of the inethra. No instrument had been passed for four years, though repeated attempts had been made by different Singeons. Being foiled in introducing a catheter into the bladder the first time I tried, I kept the patient in the Hospital for two or three weeks, attending carefully to his constitutional condition, but without making any further effort. He was then placed under chloroform, when I ' succeeded in passing No. 1. The urethra was then dilated up to No. 5, beyond which no instrument could be passed, when the perineal section was performed. The patient made an excellent cure, the fistulous openings closing, and the urine being discharged by the natural chaimel. In another case, persevering attempts had been made for five years to make an instrumentOPERATIONS FOR IMPERMEABLE STRICTURE. 911 enter the bladder, but without success, the stricture not only being exces- sively tight, but the urethra acutely sensitive ; under chloroform I succeeded in inLducing No. i silver catheter into the bladder, and speedily cured the ^ The influence Anccsthetics in facilitating the passage of instruments through apparently impenneable strictures is very marked. Shortly after the introduc- tion of ether as an anaesthetic agent, Liston was going to cut through a stricture that had resisted all attempts made by his most dexterous hand at introducing an instrument into the bladder ; but no sooner was the patient put on the table and fairly rendered insensible, than the No. 8 silver catheter, which had been passed down as far as the stricture, and the point of which was to serve as a guide to the knife, slipped into the bladder, and thus rendered a dangerous operation unnecessary. Yet no Surgeon can doubt that cases do occasionally, though rarely, occur, in which, in consequence of extravasation of urine and old inflammatory action, the urethi’a has become so tortuous and narrow, and the perinaeum so indiu’ated and disorganised, that an instrument cannot be passed through, even though the urine pass out readily. It must be borne in mind that a stricture may be permeable to urine, but impermeable to a catheter, even in the most dexterous hands. It does not follow necessarily that, because a fluid will trickle out of a nan’ow and tortuous channel, a catheter or solid sound can be passed into it from without. In a case of extravasation of lu’ine following stricture, consequent on injury of the perinreum, sent to me by Corrie of Finchley, in which no catheter had been introduced for eight years, it was found after death that, although the urethra had been converted into a mass of cicatricial tissue at the part injured, it was yet permeated by a narrow tortuous passage, through which the urine had escaped. Hence cases will occasionally occm’, in which the perineal section is not practicable. In the event, therefore, of a stricture being so tight and tortuous that no instrument wiU pass through it, or where, a portion of the urethra having sloughed away, its canal is obliterated, neither the cure by dilatation nor urethrotomy can be performed, and it may then be necessary to have recourse to incision of the stricture without a guide. Operations for Impermeable Stricture.—Two operations are practi- cable for the relief of this constriction. The flrst consists in opening the urethra from T)e]imcl, and cutting forwards through the constriction ; the second in opening the urethra in front, and dividing the stricture from before backwards. Operation from hehincl.—This operation is perfonned as follows. A No. 8 silver catheter is passed down to the stricture ; the patient is then tied up as if for lithotomy ; and the Sm-geon, sitting in front, pushes a bistoiuy with the back turned towards the rectum into the raphe of the perinjeum as far as the apex of the prostate, so as, if possible, to open the dilated urethra Uhind the stricture. He then cuts forivards through the stricture on to the point of the catheter, and, having thus opened a passage, endeavours to pass that instru- ment on into the bladder. It is often extremely difficult to find the posterior part of the urethra. When the tissues of the periniBum are hard and gristly, altered by the efiFusion of plastic matter, and condensed by repeated attacks912 DISEASES OF THE URETHRA. nfiammatiou and the existence of fistnUn, it is a most difficult mattei- to dissect through such an altered mass and hit the urethra beyond it ■ and the difficulty is still further increased by the bleeding, which is often profuse. ihis operation, I have no hesitation in saying, is perhaps the most trouble- soine m surgery. I have more than once seen the most skilful operators foiled m their endeavours to accomplish it, and compelled to relinquish the operation without concluding it, or only succeed after prolonged and most painful attempts. Fortunately, this operation is now scarcely ever necessary ; ivith patience and under chloroform the Surgeon may almost invariably pass a staff’ however small, into the bladder ; he then has a sure gviide upon which to cut' by following which he must certainly be led through the stricture into the urethra beyond it. In all cases, therefore, urethrotomy should, if practicable, be substituted for the division of the stricture without a guide. Operation from front.-^Boutonniere Operation.—Tlvi following, which is a modification of the “ button-hole ” operation, may be advantageously per- formed in some cases of stilcture which are impervious to a grooved staff or other guide, and where it may be thought necessary to divide from without in consequence of their complication with fistula. The patient having been placed and secm’ed in the lithotomy position, a moderate-sized catheter, No. 8, is passed down to the strictm-e. The catheter is then turned round, so that its point is made to project into the perinteum just above the strictm’e. The Surgeon cuts doAvn upon this by an incision about 1|- inch long in the median line, and consequently opens the urethra just above the stricture. The catheter is now withdrawn, and each side of the opened urethra seized with a sharp hook or hook-forceps, and held apart so as to expose the interior of the canal. Oozing having been allowed to cease, the aperture leading through the strictiue will now readily enough be found at the lower angle of the opened urethra. A probe or narrow director is slipped into this, and along the guide thus introduced a tenotome is passed, so as to divide the stricture. The catheter is then passed on and tied in the bladder. This operation, though often difficult, is, on the whole, far easier and safer than the other. COMPLICATIONS AND BESULTS OP STBICTURE. Retention of Urine has already been several times described as ailsing from different causes. Thus, in boys, it arises from the impaction of a cal- culus in the urethra ; in girls it is usually hysterical; in old men it is almost invariably the consequence of atony of the bladder or enlarged prostate, alone or combined. In those of middle age, stricture of the urethra is the occa- sioning cause in the vast majority of cases. Retention of urine has a tendency to occur in all tight strictiues from the gTadual and progressive contraction of the canal. It most usually, however, takes place in consequence of a conges- tive spasmodic condition being superadded to the organic constriction. It commonly happens that a patient having a moderately tight organic strictinc commits an excess, or becomes exposed to cold and wet, and thus gets such a congested condition superadded, that the urine vdll not pass at all, or only in such small quantity by drops, and with so much pain and straining, that the bladder cannot be completely emptied. In these cases the retention alwaysTREATMENT OF RETENTION OF URINE. 913 eventually becomes complete ; the bladder speedily fiUs, and rises above the pubes ; there is much distress and constitutional disturbance ; and, it rebel be not’alforded, the distended portion of the urethra behind the stricture will ultimately give way, and extravasation of urine ensue. In these circumstances it becomes imperatively necessary to empty the patient’s bladder as speedily as possible. TTj- Treatment.—This varies with the severity of the symptoms and irritaDiiity of the patient. If the retention have not continued very long, and if the patient be not very irritable, an endeavour might be made at once to give relief by passing a small catheter into the bladder. In this the Surgeon may often succeed more readily than might have been expected, the stricture frequently yielding before an instrument more easily when there is retention, than when this condition does not exist. Even if the catheter do not enter the bladder, its point or that of a catgut bougie merely being introduced Avell into the strictme, it'null generally happen, as Brodiehas pointed out, that, on the with- drawal of the instrument, the urine wiU follow in a full stream ; but if a sufficiently small catheter be used (in many cases not larger than half of No. 1 is admissible), the instrument may usually be made to fairly enter the bladder. If the patient be very initable it is better, before attempting the introduction of the instrument, to give him an opiate enema of a drachm of laudanum in about two ounces of starch, and to put him into a warm hip-bath ; the intro- duction of the catheter may now be attempted, and will very generally succeed. Should it still fail, the effect of the inhalation of chloroform should be tried, when it almost invariably may be made to pass without the employment of any great or dangerous degi’ee of force. There are no cases in surgery in which chloroform is of more value than in these; under its influence it is seldom, indeed, that the catheter wiU not pass. After the instrument has been passed into the bladder it should be left there, being tied in by means of tapes passing from its rings under the patient’s thighs, to a bandage that is passed round his waist. Antiphlogistic remedies must then be employed in rather an active manner ; a free purge, leeches to the perinseum, if there be tender- ness in this region, and salines with antimony. The catheter will be found to be loosened at the end of forty-eight hours, when it should be withdrawn, and the cure by dilatation proceeded with in the usual way. There are two conditions which in retention of urine may eventually call for operative interference. The first is the necessity of a very frequent intro- duction of the catheter, owing to an irritable state of the bladder. In these cases, it may eventually be thought safer to puncture the bladder and to estab- lish a direct opening, either through the rectum or above the pubes, rather than subject the patient to the constant teiTor of repeated catheterisms, which will end by exhausting him. Eveiy act of catheterism inflicts a certain shock to the system, greater in some, less in others ; and if this have to be repeated every three or four hours, less danger will probably result from puncture of the bladder than from the frequent repetitions of the use of the instrument, espe- cially as in these cases the patient cannot allow it to be tied in for the same reason, that of extreme irritability, that necessitates its repeated introduction. I he second condition that calls for operation is a different one, viz., the necessity of relieving retention of urine. For if the Surgeon be unable to914 DISEASES OF THE URETHRA. introcluco a catheter iii the ordinary way through the stricture, relief must be given to the over-distended bladder in some other way, lest it or the urethra burst, and extravasation of urine occur. The bladder may be emptied in four ways : 1, by Forcible Catheterism ; 2, by making an Opening into the Urethra behind and through the Stricture ; 3, by Puncturing the Viscus itself through the Eectum ; and 4, by Puncturing it above the Pubes, and 5, by Aspiration. 1. Forcible Catheterism is a most unsurgical and dangerous procedure. Nothing can surely be more improper than to take a small, stiff, silver catheter, pass it dovm to the stricture, and then, by main force, attempt to drive it on into the bladder. In these cases the • Surgeon usually fails in his attempt at reaching, the viscus, but pushes the point of the instrument into the tissues around the neck of the bladder or into the prostate, and thus induces great, and perhaps even fatal, mischief in these regions. If he should, by some fortunate accident, reach the bladder, it is not by any skilful though forcible expansion of the strictiu’e, but rather by perforating the urethra, and buiTOwing through the corpus spongiosum and prostate—“ tunnelling,” as it has been termed— until he again enter that canal, or in some such way reach the neck of the bladder. 2. Opening the Urethra behind and through the Stricture.—In the kind of retention of urme that we are now discussing, the safest, though by no means the easiest mode of affording relief after the fadiu’e of the catheter, is to make an incision into the middle line of the perinfeum, and to open the urethra behind or through the stricture. In doing this there is much less difficulty in cases of retention, than Avhen the bladder is empty. In conse- quence of the urethra being distended by the accumulation of urine, and by the straining of the patient, it sometimes attains a considerable magnitude ; though, if this be not the case, the operation may prove a very serious and difficult one. The operation, which is essentially the same as that for imper- meable stricture, described at p. 911, is performed by passing a catheter down to the stricture ; opening the distended sinus of the urethra ieijond this ; cutting upAvards through the stricture upon the end of the instrument ; and then passing the instrument on into the bladder, or allowing the urine to flow from the aperture thus made in the perina3um. In doing this, care must be taken to keep strictly in the direction of the mesial line, so as not to wound A’essels of importance. One advantage of this operation is. that the stricture may by it be cured at the same time that the retention is relieved ; and, as the incisions do not extend into the bladder, but are limited to the urethra, there is less danger to the patient than when that viscus is opened. Another adA^antage of the perineal incision in these cases is, that it not unfrequently happens that urinary abscess has begun to form, or the extra- vasation of a few drops of urine has taken place sooner than the Surgeon may have had any idea of: and if so, the incision through the perinaaum wdl afford an exit for any extravasated matters, at the same time that it relieves the patient from the distress and danger of the retention. Should any mischief of this kind have taken place, it is not necessary to be so particular about opening the urethra with the knife; for, an apertme having ah-eady been established in it, the urine will readily flow through the artificial channel thus formed by free incision into the inflamed or suppurating perinamm.PUNCTURE OF BLADDER THROUGH RECTUM. 915 3. Pxincture of the Bladder through the Rectum. Atfccr emptying the bowel by means of an enema, the Surgeon passes the left index-finger well into the gut, feeling for the posterior margin of the prostate; he then ciirries the trochar and cannula, which aic long and somewhat curved, upon this as a guide, and, when the extremity of the instrument has reached the jiosterior edge of the prostate, he pushes it upwards into the bladder (Fig- 734). The seat of the punctime between but in fronc of the uretere is well shown in Fig. 814, which represents the bladder and strictured urethra of a man who died some days after this operation had been per- formed for retention from stricture. In performing this operation, the Surgeon perforates the liladder in that portion of its fundus which is uncovered by peritoneum, being bounded behind by the reflection of the serous membrane, anteriorly by the prostate, and on each side by the vesiculm seminales. In order to avoid wounding any of these structures, he should keep strictly in the mesial line, and . puncture immediately behind the prostate. In through Reetmu lu a case of stnc- introducing the instrument into the rectum, the Surgeon should withdraw the point of the stylet into the cannula, so as to avoid wounding the gut, and not push it forwards until he has the end of the cannula fixed against the spot where he intends to make the perforation. After withdraMung the stylet and emptying the bladder, the cannula should be tied in by means of tapes. It is often difficult to prevent the cannula from slipping out of the wound when only tied in, and thus exposing the patient to the danger of urinary infiltration. It may be securely retained by means of a stitch of silver wire passed on either side through the slit in the guard and the contiguous skin of the nates. The cannula should be retained for a few days until urine begins to pass by the urethra, or until a catheter has been passed through the stricture, when it must be withdrawn and the aperture left to close. In consequence of the irritation of the mdne being remox’ed fr'om the urethra, a catheter may often be passed a few days after the operation ; and the stricture vdU readily yield to dilatation in the ordinary way. This operation has the advantage of being far easier of performance than the last, and may doubtless occasionally be requii’ed in those very rare cases of retention from stricture in which there is no sign of abscess or extravasa- tion in the perinasum, in which the urethra appears not to be dilated behind the stricture, in which the prostate is not enlarged, and in which, under chlorofoiTn, and with patience, a catheter cannot be passed into the bladder ; a combination of circumstances that will but very rarely indeed occur to a '>Surgeon skilled in the use of his instruments. The operation of puncture through the rectum is not devoid of danger; peiitonitis, urinary infiltration, and pelvic inflammation and abscess, mav vesult from it. ^ :> X 29i6 DISEASES OF THE UltETlIRA. The recto-vesical iDoiich of tlie peritoneum will sometimes descend so ab- normally low as to cover the has fond of the bladder as far as the prostate, lea^-ing- no space for a puncture to be safely made. This condition neces- sarily cannot be determined during life, hence its great danger. I have known two instances in which a double puncture was in this way made through the fold of the recto-vesical pouch, half an inch beyond an unenlarged prostate, for relief of retention. In both cases, death from peritonitis occuived. The preparations are in University College I\Iuseum. In a remarkable case that Avas under my care at the Hospital (in 1859), a sequence occurred winch I have never seen noticed ; viz., the diffusion of rectal flatus through the areolar tissue of the pelvis and down the thighs and nates, producing aii emphysematous condition of these parts and the death of the patient. The case was briefly as foUoAA's. A middle-aged man had suffered from traumatic stricture for very many years — indeed, from childhood. He Avas admitted with retention. As no catheter ever had been or could be passed, I punctured the bladder by the rectum in the usual way. The cannula was removed on the fifth day. He then passed urine ■urefhram, and continued to do so up to the time of his death. The day after the Avithdrawal of the cannula he felt very ill, but Avithout any positive or tangible complaint. The next day it Avas found that the back and inner part of both thighs were emphysematous and crackling, evidently distended with air. The emphysema extended downwards and also up the flanks, and ap- peared eA'eii in the right arm. There was no pain or discoloration. He died on the following day, the eighth after the puncture. After death no trace of pelvic inflammation, suppiuation, or luinary extraAmsation Avas found; but there w^as much infiltration of gas under the pelvic peritoneum, and in the areolar tissue between the bladder and rectum. The gas had probably passed through the sciatic notches into the posterior parts of the thighs. It was fetid, like intestinal flatus. 4. Puncture of the Bladder above the Pubes, in cases of retention from stricture, is but seldom resorted to ; although some Siugeons of emi- nence, more especially Paget of Leicester, have strongly recommended and often practised it. This operation, which has been discussed at p. 868, is un- doubtedly easy of performance, and sufficiently safe, though not devoid of the danger of infiltration of urine into the tissues around the puncture, and of the inconvenience of a fistulous opening being left. There is one class of cases to which it appears to be especially applicable, and in which I have had occasion to practise it ; viz., those cases of retention from impassable strictiue, in which. there co-exists an enlargement of the prostate, rendering puncture through the: rectum impossible, the Surgeon’s finger not being able to reach beyond the en- • larged prostate ; and here undoubtedly the safest, if not the only course to i pursue, is the suprapubic puncture. 5. The Employment of the Aspirator for the purpose of emptying am over-distended bladder is, however, upon the whole the simplest method off treatment, and should be preferred to any of the preceding plans, in the first; instance at all events. The perforating trochar of the aspirator should be: passed directly into the bladder above the pubes. The operation is a sunple ■ one, and Avith a little care is perfectly safe. The chief point is not to thrust theEXTRAVASATION OF URINE. 917 perforator too deeply, and gently to withdi-aw it before the whole of the urine has escaped, so as to prevent the emptied bladder froui collapsing upon and being wounded by its point (see pp. r>70, 571). After the bladder has been punctured, by whichever of these methods the Surgeon may think proper to adopt, means must be taken to restore the calibre of the urethra, so as to prevent the orifice of the puncture from de- generating into a permanent fistulous opening. With this view the cannula Siould be°left in the bladder, and the urine allowed to discharge through it for from four to six days. At the expiration of this time, should no urine ha^-e passed by the urethra, the stricture in the canal will be found to be relaxed, and a small instrument may usually without much difficulty be intro- duced into the bladder, where it should be retained, the cannula being Avith- drawn. The cure of the strictiu’e by dilatation may then be proceeded noth in the usual Avay. In connection Avith this subject, it may be stated that Puncture of the Bladder may be required for the foUoAAung conditions :— 1. Impermeable stricture (through rectum). 2. Complete rupture of imethra (throirgh rectum). 3. Enlarged prostate (above pubes). Extravasation of Urine is one of the most dangerous and fatal results of unreheved retention. This serious accident most commonly occurs in con- sequence of that portion of the urethra Avhich is immediately behind the strictiu’e becoming over-distended, so that it may be thinned ; and a fissm’e then forming in it, a few drops of mine escape into the surrounding areolar tissue. Some sloughing immediately ensues, the narrow apertiu’e made in the urethra becomes enlarged, and the urine is then driven with the AA^hole force of the contraction of the OA'er-distended bladder into the areolar tissue of the perinmum, scrotum, and groin. In other cases, a lacuna in the urethra infiames, an urinary abscess forms, and the urine being clilven into this, the cyst gives way, and general extravasa- tion occurs. The part of the urethra that gives way is almost invariably the membranous portion of the canal, just between the layers of the triangular ligament, where it is Aveak, being least supported by siUTOunding structures, and usually most dilated and attenuated by the pressure to which it has been subjected. The extravasated urine afterwards finds its way through the anterior layer of the triangular ligament, Avhere it is perforated by the urethra, and so beneath the deep layer of the superficial fascia of the perinieum, by Avhich its course is aftei’Avards directed. This fascia is firmly attached across the perinmiun to the free border of the triangular ligament and, along each side, to the rami of the ischium and pubes, as far upwards as the pubic spine, from Avhich point its attachments are continued outAA'^ards along Poupart’s ligament to the crest of the ilium. The extravasated urine, therefore, uniformly takes a course fonvard into the perinanim and scrotum, and upAvards upon the external organs of generation, the groins, and the anterior abdominal Avail : so that it ascends contrary to its gi’aAUty rather than soaks back into the more dependent parts of the body, as it Avould do, Avere it not for the particular connection of the fascia) that has just been alluded to. I have, hoAveA'er, knoAAUi the super-DISEASES OF THE UllETllRA. 9i8 ficial fascia to giyo way, and the urine, then gravitating backward, to give rise to extensive sloughing in the ischio-rectal fossas and about the nates, denudin" the rectum. ” Local Effects of Extravasated Urine.—The elfects of urine that has become acrid, decomposed, and concentrated by long retention, are most dele- terious upon those tissues Avith Avhich it comes into contact. It acts as an irritant poison on all that it touches. The vitality of Avhatevcr portion of areolar tissue it infiltrates is immediately destroyed ; the tissue becoming con- A’erted into a kind of putrid stringy slough, intermixed Avith and soddeued by a quantity of fetid dark-coloured acrid pus and urine. The ravages of extra- vasated mine are often extensive ; the urethra giving Avay suddenly behind the stricture, the fluid is driven Avith all the force of the vital and physical con- tractihty of the over-distended bladder into the perinseum, and thence rapidly flnds its way through the scrotum upAA'ards. In other cases, again, the extra- vasation occurs more slowly ; a feAv drops appear first of all to escape from the urethra through a small rent or ulcer in it ; these gwe rise to inflammation in the sm-rounding structures, by which the progress of the extravasation is for a time limited. It is especially upon the areolar tissue of the scrotum that the effects of the extravasation manifest themselves in their full intensity, causing great distension and rapid sloughing of it. The skin speedily participates in this action, becoming of a dusky-red or purple colour, and then falling into a state of gangrene. In this Avay the testes may become denuded, and the cords exposed. It is remarkable, however, if the patient surAuve these de- structive effects, Avith Avhat rapidity reparative action goes on in this region. It is seldom that infiltration extends higher than the gToins, or the anterior- portion of the abdominal wall; but it may reach the costal cartilages before proA'ing fatal. When the extravasation is deep, the m-ethra being opened betAveen the layers of the triangular ligament, the patient, after suffering from retention, experiences a sensation of relief, as if he Avere emptying his bladder, and as if something had giA'en way in the perinaeum, followed after a time by a hot, bm-ning, and throbbing pain. There may be but little swelling for a day or tAvo, but then a doughy red diffused intumescence takes place in the scrotum and rapidly extends forwards. When the ruptm-e is altogether anterior to the deep perineal fascia, then rapid swelling and infiltration, partly m-inous, partly inflammatoi’y, take place in the scrotum and penis ; these parts become enor- mously distended, oedematous, crackling, and emphysematous, Avith the local signs that have already been mentioned. The Constitutional Disturlance is always considerable ; at first it is of an irritative type, but is speedily folloAved by asthenic and typhoid symptoms, by Arhich the patient is at last carried off. The Treatment consists in making a free and ready outlet for the urine as early as possible. This should be done, as soon as the extravasation is knoAni to have occim-ed, by a deep incision into the middle of the pciinaium. So soon as any pain and throbbing, with diffused SAvelling, occur in the perineum, with redness and more or less oedema of the scrotum, the patient should be draAATi to the end of the bed and placed in the position for lithotomy. The Surgeon should next introduce his left index-finger into the rectum, so that theUrdNARY ABSCESS. 919 gut may not be woiindccl, and then pushing a long sharp-pointed bistomy deeply in the raphe of the periincum, cut upward to a sufficient extent into the extravasation, and in the direction of the urethra. A catheter should then, if possible, be introduced, secured in the bladder, and left unplugged, with an india-rubber tube attached ; in this way no further effusion can occur, an out- let will be afforded to matters already effused, and the greater part of the ui-ine will connnonly be found to escape after a time by the aperture thirs made. Should the case not be seen until extravasation has spread widely, a free incision should not only be made into the perinmum, extending to the aperture in the urethra, but also into the scrotum on each side of the septum, into the penis, and wherever else swelling is observed. The sole chance of safety for the patient lies in making these free incisions, through which the parts may, to a certain extent, empty themselves. However extensive the infiltration and serious the mischief may be, rve need not despair of the patient if a free outlet can be obtained for the acrid and putrescent urine and effused matters ; and in order to secure this, the infiltration must be followed by incisions as high as it extends. The parts must, at the same time, be covered with chlorinated and yeast poultices; and the constitutional powers of the patient mnst be supp(p:ted “ by good nourishment and a sufficient supply of stimulants. If the patient survive the immediate impression upon the system produced by the gangrene and the urinary infiltration, he must be prepared to go through a severe trial to liis constitutional powers, in the separation of the sloughs, the profuse discharge, and other sonrees of irritation that are set up. During this period he will require abundant support; the brandy-and-egg mixture, ammonia and bark, with any nourishment that he can take ; and much attention should be paid to the removal of the sloughs, to giving a ready outlet to the discharges, and to keeping the patient as clean and as free from all local irritation as possible. Urinary Abscess may be considered in many cases as a limited effusion of mine mixed with pus, and circumscribed by plastic matter that is deposited in the tissues with which the mme comes into contact. It is generally occasioned by the iiritation of the passage of instruments, but may arise simply as the effect of stricture, or from inflammation of some of the urethral follicles. From some cause of this kind a small abrasion or aperture forms in the methra, a drop or two of urine escapes into the subcutaneous areolar tissue, and this becomes bounded or circumscribed by plastic deposit around it, so that extra- vasation does not occur. Such an abscess as this may fonn at any part of the methra ; but it is most frequently met with in the perineeum, appearing to take its origin from the bulb or membranous part. It is rarely dangerous, but is chiefly of consequence by being commonly followed by minary fistula. The extent and the amount of mischief done by an urinary abscess wiU greatly depend on the side of the methra on which it is situated. Whma, as usually happens, it forms at the lower surface of the canal, it readily comes forward without much or extensive buiTowing. But when situated on the upper wall of the methra (which, however, is very rare,) or at the upper part of the side of the canal, it may buiTow widely before it points or is discharged exter- nally, occasioning great induration, infiltration, and mischief in neighbourino- parts. °DISEASES OF THE URETHRA. 920 Symptoms.—An urinary abscess is indicated by the formation of a small, somewhat cirenmscribed, bal'd, and painful tumour, situated in the neighbour- hood of the urethra. It is usually unattended by constitutional disturbance ; unless it attain any considerable bulk, when some pyrexia may ensue. It is principally in the perinmum that it attains any degree of magnitude, then constituting a perineal abscess, characterised by a deeply seated, hard, tense tumour, brawny and without fluctuation; attended by considerable weight and throbbing in this region. It does not readily point, owing to the manner’ in which it is bound down by the superficial fascia. Treatment.—Early incision is required. When the abscess occurs in the scrotum or anterior to it the Surgeon should wait for fluctuation ; but when it is seated in the perinmum, he need not do so, but should at once make a free incision through the mesial line into the hard brawny mass, in order to prevent the certainty of extravasation of urine. After the opening has been made, fomentations and poultices should be used. Urinary ristuiee commonly form in the perinEeum and scrotum, as the result of abscess in these regions communicating with the urethra ; occasion- ally, however, they are met with in other situations, as in the groin, the anterior abdominal waU, or the inside of the thigh. They usually communicate with the bulb or with the membranous portion of the urethra, but occasionally occur anterior to this. In number they vary considerably ; when ocem-ring in the scrotal and penile portions of the urethra, they are usually single; but when in the perineal, they are often rather numerous ; several apertures being occasionally met with about the perinteum, scrotum, and nates. In one case Civiale found as many as fifty-two. Their size also differs considerably ; some only admitting the finest probe, whilst others are large cloacae. In a case under my care, the patient had a tunnel of this kind in the groin that would readily admit three fingers. They are usually tortuous, elongated, and narrow ; sometimes constricted externally and more widely dilated behind. The smTounding parts are greatly condensed ; the whole of the scrotum and penis is enormously enlarged, indm-ated, and almost cartilaginous in structure. The urine may escape almost entirely through the fistuhe, scarcely any being discharged through the lu’ethral orifice; or there may be but a slight exudation from the fistulous openings. The Treatment of m'inary fistula varies according as it is complicated with stricture, and as it is situated in the anterior or the posterior part of the canal. If there be a stricture, this, as the cause of the fistula, will require removal either by dilatation or by the perineal section. If the strictine be not very tight and hard, dilatation commonly succeeds ; the instrument being intro- duced every second or third day, until the m’ethra is dilated to its normal size, when the fistulous tracks will in many cases close. In some instances, however, the frequent introduction and withdrawal of the catheter is a source of irritation, and then it had better be left in. When this practice is adopted, a moderate-sized elastic catheter should be used. If this be too small, the urine will flow between it and the sides of the urethra, and thus escape through the fistuhn ; if too large, it stretches the urethral orifice of the fistula injuriously. If the stricture be very tough and irritable, the better plan is to performUllETHROPLASTY. 9-^ iirethi-otomy at once, as much time and pain are thus saved. In the majority of instances, internal urethrotomy with Civiale’s instrument appears to me to be the safest and simplest procedure, and I have very advantageously practised it in such cases. But if the fistulm be veiy numerous so as to riddle the perinmum and scrotum in all directions, perhaps the^ bet er p an^ is o perform the perineal section. In this way we not only divide the strictui^, and thus at once remove all obstruction, but give a free exit to the iu*ine, which, instead of escaping by tortuous and sinuous passages, finds its way out readily through the new aperture that has been made, which will eventually granulate and heal by the second intention. The fistulm, especially if small and recent, will sometimes heal kindly enough after the removal of the obstruction ; but if extensive, old, and carti- laginous, they are of course little disposed to take on reparative action ; and although the cause that in the first instance gave rise to them may lie removed, yet they constitute an independent affection which requires special treatment. The special treatment for urinary fistula must vary according to the size of the canal, but more particularly with regard to the part of the urethra with which it communicates ; whether it be in Perineal, a Scrotal, or a Penile fistula. But in all cases, and wherever it be situated, there is one most important point to be attended to, ^iz., never to let the fistula be disturbed or irritated by the passage of urine over or through it, or it will never heal. Hence the m'ine must always be drawn off with the catheter, which the patient should be taught to pass for himself. If the fistula be Perineal, and of small size, a probe coated with melted nitrate of silver, or a wire made red-hot in the ordinary way, or by the galvanic current, and passed down it oecasionally, may cause its contraction. If it be large, a gum-catheter should be kept in the bladder, and the edges of the fistula fr'eely rubbed with the nitrate of silver, or deeply pared and brought together by quilled sutures. If the fistulas be large and very numerous, it will be better to pass a grooved director down the principal ones, and sht them up so as to throw the several sinuses into the larger one. When the fistula is Scrotal, it often requires to be laid open, and to be made to granulate from the bottom, when it may be found to communicate “with large sloughy and ill-conditioned cavities in this situation. When Penile, the fistula is usually much more troublesome to heal; its edges are thin, and the track is short and shallow. Urethroplasty may in such cases be advantageously practised. Opera- tions of this kind require for their success very careful management and minute attention to detail; they very commonly fail in consequence of a small quantity of urine or of mucus escaping through the wound, and thus inter- fering wth union of its lips. In order to prevent this accident, which is fatal to the success of the operation, the patient should be taught to pass a catheter, and thus to draw off his own urine after the operation as often as necessary ; or an assistant must do this CVC17 third or foiu’th hour. Should this, however, not be practicable, a fr;ll-sized gum-catheter should be passed into the bladder and properly secured there. It should be left without a plug, so that no distension of the bladderDISEASES OF THE URETHRA. 922 and consequent likelihood of escape of urine between the urethra and the instrument may take place. In order to prevent urinous eliusion over the integuments of the penis and scrotum, a vulcanised India-rubber tube should be attached to the end of the catheter, by which means the flow of the urine is directed away from the patient. Urethroplastic operations may be varied aceording to the seat and extent of the fistulous opening. If the fistula be in the the parts around being thickened and indurated, its closure may often be attained by freely and deeply paring the edges, and then bringing them together with the quilled suture, or by Sims’s button. When the fistula is scrotal, the edges should be freely pared, and the parts around widely dissected up so as to form large and thick flaps of ceUulo-cuta- neous tissue, which may be brought and held together by metalhc sutures or shotted clamps. In this way, if union be not obtained throughout the whole length of the fistula, it may be to a partial extent; and, after a time, a second or a third operation wiU complete the cure. When the fistula is penile, the difficulties in effecting closure become immensely increased. This is owing to the thinness of the integumental structures and the absence of subcutaneous areolar tissue in this region, so that there is not snfficient thickness of the parts for ready plastic union. In these cases, the Surgeon has a choice of four operations. 1. Nelaton has recommended the following procedure. The edges of the fistula ha-vung been pared, the skin around, to the extent of. about an inch, should be dissected up subcutaneously through an opening made below the fistula, the edges of which must then be brought together by a few points of suture. The displacement of the skin covers in the apertm’e in the inethra and causes granulations to spring up, by which the fistula is closed (Fig. 815). 2. The edges of the fistula having been pared and the skin separated widely, lateral incisions may be made so as to take off aU tension, and a slip of India-rubber may then be passed underneath the flaps of skin, in order to pre- vent contact of the m-ine fr-onr dis- tinbing the adhesions (Fig. 816). 3. Eicord, recognising the fact that the occasional intrusion of a drop of urine between the ration: FirstMetiiod. pj,gg|jened edges of the integu- ments brought together to close the fistula has been the most common cause of disunion, has recommended that, in those cases in which a perineal or a scrotal fistula happens to co-ex:st Fig. 810.—Urethroiilasty.

Should no fistula exist in the perinamm, he has proposed, though I believe the operation has never yet been practised, to puncture the bladder—which would most conveniently and safely be done through the rectum—and to keep it emptied in this ivay until the penile fistula has been closed by one of the preceding operations, and then to tdlow the lower apertm-e to close spontaneously; or, if it were situated in the perinanmi, to adopt surgical means for its occlusion. 4. Le Gros Clark has recommended and successfully practised the following operation. Having pared the edges of the fistula, he makes a transverse cut Fig. sir.-- Urethroplasty. Clai-k’s Operation : Fig. 818.—Urethroplasty. Clark’s Operation : First stage. Second Stage. through the integuments of the penis, about an inch in length, above and below it. He then dissects up the flaps of skin so bounded, and brings them together by means of clamps or the quilled suture. By this operation a wide raw surface from each side is brought into contact, instead of a mere raw edge of cut integument, and there is consequently a greater chance of successful union resulting (Figs 817, 818). Death after Operations on the Urinary Organs.—As has already been stated in the preceding chapters, that condition which more than any other infiuences the result of operation on the urinary organs is the state of the kid- neys. If these be sound, recovery, even after the most severe operations, is the rule. Hence in a great measure, doubtless, the low rate of mortality after lithotomy in children. If the kidneys be diseased, the most trivial operation, the introduction of a lithotrite or the passage of a catheter, may lead to a fatal result. When death occurs in Kthotrity in cases of umelieved stone, chronic prostate disease, or during the treatment of a stricture, it most frequently is caused by suppurative inflammation of the kidneys. Stricture of the Female Urethra is rare. When it occurs, it is seated at the external orifice, which will be found to be narrowed and sharp-edged. There is often some thickening of the corpus spongiosum. The disease is always, I believe, the result of gonorrhoea. The symptoms are the ordinary one of iri’itability of the bladder, frequent desire to micturate, and some diffi- culty or delay in doing so.924 DISEASES OF TILE URETHRA. The Treatment consists in the dilatation of the orifice by means of a two- bladed dilator (Fig. 80G). Preternatural communications between the urinary passages and the vagina commonly arise A’om injurious pressiue upon and consequent sloughing of the anterior wall of this canal, to a greater or less extent, during parturition. They may, however', occur from idiopathic abscess, or from maligirant disease involving those parts. Varieties.—Urinary vaginal fistulaj ai'e essentially of two kinds, according as the communication is established between the urethra or the fiuidus of the bladder and the vagina. Hence they may be divided into Uretloral and Vesical. Ureth.ro-Vaginal Fistulas are, so far as my observation goes, of most common occurrence ; and this is readily explained by the fact that the urethra passes along the anterior aspect of the vagina for some distance before it ter- minates in the bladder, and occupies that portion of the vaginal wall which is most hkely to be compressed, during labour, under the arch of the pubes. These fistulas are usually of small size and linear. Vesico-vaginal Fistulee estabhsh a communication between the neck or fundus of the bladder and the vagina. They are consequently situated further back than the other, and are usually larger and more ragged. Results.—The existence of a lu-inary fistula in the vagina is always a soiu'ce of serious discomfort and distress to the patient. The dribbling of urine through the preternatural aperture is generally continuous ; although, if this be situated far back behind the orifices of the imeters, it may be somewhat intermittent, a flow taking place as the lower portion of the bladder fills. The incontinence of urine thus produced gives rise to irritation and excoriation about the external parts, and occasions a strong ammoniacal odour to hang about the patient. The precise seat and extent of the fistulous opening are best ascertained by posterior and lateral walls of the vagina with bent spatulie ; when the anterior aspect of that canal wiU have a tendency to protrude, and thus to expose the fistula, at the same time that the introduction of a bent probe, or of a female catheter, into the m'ethra, wiU guide the Surgeon to the artificial opening ui the urinary passage. Treatment.—The cure of a vaginal fistula can only be accomphs e y causing a coalescence of its sides. When it is small, about a line or two in diameter, and more especially if urethral, this may best lie effected by tone un„ fLo nf t.Rp tniprinTn with the ualvaiiic cautei’y or a led-hot wn’e, an re urinary vaginal FISTULiE. placing the patient on her knees opposite a good light, and holding aside theTREATMENT OF VAGINAL FISTULA. 925 however, two difficulties present themselves—the sutures either cutting their way out too soon, or the trickling of urine between the freshly pared edges interfer-irrg with adhesiorr. In order to overcome these difficulties, a variety of ingenious contr-ivances have been introduced by different Sru’geons ; amongst which may be especially mentioned the clamps of Marion Sims and Baker- Brown, and the button-suture of Bozeman. To Sims especially is due the great merit of having srrbstituted silver wires for siUc sutures in this operation, by wliich the probabilities of a successful result have been very greatly irrereased. Before the operation, the bowels should have been fi-eely opened by castor-oil and an enema. I^Io chlorofor-m should be given, as its administration interferes with the position that the patient must maintain during the operation. This should be on the knees and elbows, on a narvow table, Avith the buttocks well raised and the head low. It is of gr’eat moment that the parts should be freely ex- posed. This is best done by means of the “duck- billed” speerdurn (Fig. 819), by Avhich the posterior- wall of the vagina is well draryn up and out of the AA'ay of the operator, and light is reflected on the fistulous opening. The edges of the aperture are noAV to be freely pared. This is best done by seizing them Arith a hook-forceps or a double hook, and dissecting off the vaginal mucous membrane to the exterrt of about a quarter of an inch all round, by means of a fine small scalpel or angularly set knives (Figs. 820, 821) and scissors properly curved. The dissection shorfid be earned towards the fissrue, and especial care taken that the angles are Avell cleared of mucous membrane. After the edges of the fistnla have been freely pared, and all bridles or cica Pig. 819.—Buck-biUetl Speculum. Figs. 820 nml 821.—Angularly Curved Knives. tricial constrictions divided, sutiues of silver or annealed iron wire (which does not rust) are passed across the lips of the wound. These wires may most conAeniently be passed by means of the holloAv needle (Fig. 822); or if this be not at hand, a silk thread may be passed by a mevus or cork-screw needle a full half inch ft-om the freshened edge of the fistula, and brought out throimh a coiTesponding point on the other side of the fistula, without haA'ing transfixed he mucous membrane of the bladder.

Sims then passes the uppermost free ends through holes made in a narrow leaden bar, on which they arc clamped, by having split shot fixed upon them in the same way as is done on a fishing line. The unclamped Fig. S22.—Hollow Suture Needle. wires are now drawn down until the bar is pulled close to the upper sutm-e holes ; and a second clamp is then fixed to these ends and is pushed up against the lower suture apertures. In this way the edges of the fistula are brought and held together on each side by a clamp, which may be allowed to remain in from seven to ten days. The clamps may then be removed by clipping off the flattened shots from the anterior one, which is thus detached from its bed. The posterior one, with the wires attached, may then be hooked up, pushed backwards, and lifted out of the vagina with forcejis. Instead of a clamp, Simpson used a splint made of annealed iron wire, which surrounds and sup- ports the tissues around the fistula. In many cases, however, where the fistula is of but moderate size, the clamp and splint may be dispensed with, and the edges of the opening brought together mth the suture wires only. In the after-treatment, especial attention is required: and here the great point is t6 prevent the contact of the urine with the edges of the fistula. With this view a catheter should be introduced, and worn in the bladder, so that no urine may collect in this organ. For this purpose, Sims has invented a very ingenious catheter, represented in the annexed cut (Fig. 823), which may be worn with more comfort, and vuth less chance of slipping, than the ordinary in- strument. After the patient has been put to bed, and the catheter introduced, a full opiate should be given, and continued thi-ough- out the treatment, with a view of preventing the action of the bowels, a point on which Sims lays much stress, and to which the success of his operations may be in a great measure attributed. It is very seldom that they require to be opened for ten^ or fifteen days, provided the patient be kept on a rigid ’diet. During this treatment the catheter may be removed once or tvdee a day, in order to be cleai^ed and to be kept free from phosphatic or mucous accumulations ; and free ablutions of the external genitals by sponge or syringe and wann water should be practised during the whole of the treatment. After the removal of the sutures, Sims advises that the catheter should be continued, and great care taken that the patient do not move too soon, lest the weak cicatrix be A very simple and successful mode of closing these fistuke has been invented Fig. 823.—Sims's Catheter.927 TUMOURS IN THE URETHRA. by Bozeman, by what he terms the “ button-suture.” After paring the edges of the fistula, and passing silver wires across in the usual Avay, he draws the parts together by passing both ends of the wire through an aperture in a steel rod, which being carried along them closes the opening. A thin leaden plate. “ the button,” properly perforated down the middle, is then slipped along the wires so as to cover the fistula (Fig. 824); and split shot having been pushed along, their fine extremities are pressed tightly against the button, the wires are then properly nipped, and the apparatus left on for about ten days (Fig. 824); the shot are then cut off, the leaden plate is carefully lifted off, and the sutme wires, having been straightened out, are withdrawn. Whatever kind of suture may be employed, it is always of gneat importance that the edges of the fistula be brought together transversely to the long axis of the vagina. Should the abnormal aperture be close to, or even implicate, the cervix uteri, this part may be drawn down and transfixed with the sutures, thus adding materially to the support of the posterior lip of the fissure. Small Polypoid Tumours are not unfrequently met with inside the urethral orifice. They have occasionally a gonorrhoeal origin, though they commonly arise irrespectively of such disease. They are always very vascular, and are most fi-equently met with in or around the female imethra, where they are of a bright red colour, have a florid hue, bleed freely when touched, and are com- posed of a spongy kind of erectile tissue ; they are commonly conoidal or oval, encircling the urethral orifice on one side, or even forming a complete zone around it. They grow slowly, and seldom attain a larger size than that of a raspberiy. They are not unfrequently aceompanied by a vast deal of sympa- thetic iii’itation, great pain in micturition, attended by an admixture of mucus or pus in the urine, uneasiness of the lower part of the abdomen, and often aching in the loins. These vascular tumours are far less frequent iii the male than in the female urethra. When they occur in men, they usually constitute a small granular florid mass inside the orifice of the canal. ^ When seated in or around the female urethra, these tumours not unfrequently give rise to very great and continuous irritation ; much pain during and after passing urine, radiating through the whole pelvic region, and, in fact, many of the symptoms of stone; so that patients labouring under this affection are often sounded on the supposition of the existence of calculus.

TUMOUBS IN THE UBETHBA.DISEASES OF THE URETHRA. 92S Tiikatjiext.—Vascular uretliral tumours may be removed in four ways ; by Excision, Ligature, Caustics, or the Actual Cautery. 1. Excision. When situated within the male urethra, the tumours should be snipped off by a fine pair of curved scissors. When situated in or around the female urethra, if of small size and pedunculated, they may readily enough be removed by the scissors or dissected away ; the canal of the urethra being encroached on as little as possible. This operation is, however, always attended or followed by very considerable and continuous arterial haemon-hage, which has even, in some instances, been fatal. Hence, when the tumour is large, and the patient weakly, excision should be practised with much caution. If it be done, the hasmorrhage may be arrested by the introduction of a catheter into the urethra, and by firm pressiue on the bleeding surface by means of a pad of lint, supported by a T-bandage. 2. Ligature is not a convenient mode of removing these gvowths; its applica- tion is difficult, very painful, and tedious. 8. Caustics, particularly strong nitric acid or potassa cum calce, may be very conveniently employed where the tumour is of small size and very vascular. In applying them, the upper waU of the canal must be protected by a broad director introduced along it. 4. The Actual or Galvanic Gcmlery is the most convenient agent for the removal of vascular tumours from the female urethra. By it th,ey are at once destroyed without hmmon’hage ; and the eschar that is formed protects the subjacent raw siuface from the iratation of the luine. If they be situated deeply vdthin the urethra, and of small size, the galvanic cautery or a red-hot wire will most easily reach them ; but if they be At or around the orifice, I employ a small olive-shaped cautery. During its application, the siuTOimding parts may be protected from the action of heat by a wooden spoon having a hole cut in the middle through which the application is made, and the upper Avail of the luethra by a director or silver catheter, which should be retained after the operation.929 CONGENITAL MALFORMATIONS OF PENIS. CHAPTER LXXIII. —♦— DISEASES OF THE PENIS AND SCROTUM. DISEASES OF THE PENIS. CoxGEiaTAL Malfoemations.—Adhesion of Penis to Scrotum. I have once, and once only, met with a very curious malformation of the genital organs, the penis being tied down by its under surface to the scrotum, so as to lie in a deep sulcus between the testes. In this case the raph6 of the scrotum appeared to be continued in a narrow rather firm band upwards to the imder surface of the penis, so that this organ was always bent or bowed down- wai’ds. The patient, a man of 30, passed his urine downwards, apparently from the under surface of the scrotum ; when erection took place, the penis ■curved up in a semicircular form, the convexity upwards, the glans penis being tightly tied down to the scrotum by the narrow tense band continued up from the raphe. In fact, the condition of this organ was very like that which is met •with in the tongue when “tongue-tied.” This malformation was remedied by cutting through the frsenum which tied the penis do'wn, and thus liberating the organ. Hypospadias.—It occasionally happens that there is an aiTest of union in the mesial line of the'penis, so that a slit or fissm’c is left communicating -with the urethra. This gap commonly occiu’S on the under surface of the organ, constituting hypospadias, and is confined to the glans and upper part of the penis; though it occasionally extends backwards to the root of the organ, and may then be associated with some of those kinds of malformation that are erroneously considered as examples of hermaphroditism. These conditions are mostly incurable, though plastic proceedings have occasionally been devised and practised for their rehef. Absence of Corpus Spongiosum and Urethra.—In some cases the methra terminates at the anterior part of the scrotum. There is a depression, but no canal, in the glans penis at the seat of the meatus. Between the glans and the point at which the urethra terminates, and whence the urine issues, the corpus •spongiosum is deficient, and is replaced by a dense band of fibroid tissue •somewhat resembling in hardness and tension the cicatrix of a burn. Hence there is not only absence of the penile portion of the urethi-a, but an absolute want of development of that part of the corpus spongiosum that lies between the glans and scrotum. When erection takes place, the organ assumes a •crescentic shape, wth the convexity upwards, the tense and hard cord that has just been mentioned stretching across its arc like the string of a bow, thus rendering connection impossible, and the sufferer practically impotent!DISEASES OF THE PENIS AND SCROTUM. 93° Til such cases as,these the organ may be greatly improved by dissecting through the cord in front of the urethral orifice, and behind the glans, separating the skin freely on each side, and then bringing it together in the mesial line. But the urethra cannot be lengthened, and hence both micturition and emis- sion take place immediately in front of the scrotum. Epispadias.—The upper surface of the penis is less frequently fissui-ed ; only, I believe, in cases of extroversion of the bladder. This condition, teimed epispadias, may be remedied to some extent by Wood’s operation, described at p. 840, IhriMOSis.—The prepuce is not unfrequently the seat of malformation or disease. The condition of it in which it is so much elongated that it extends beyond the glans, and at the same time is so much contracted that it prevents the proper exposure of this portion of the organ, is termed iMmosis. This may be either congenital, or acquired as the result of inflammation or disease. In Congenital Phimosis, the penis is usually somewhat atrophied, and the development of the glans is prevented by the pressure of the narrow prepuce. In congenital phimosis the skin is abundant and lax; but the mucous lining of the prepuce is short, contracted, and undeveloped. It is in this situation, and not in the skin, that the congenital defect is situated. In the majority of cases this condition is simply a soiu’ce of local inconvenience ; but it may become a cause of disease from a variety of causes. Thus in children the retention of the sebaceous secretion—the “smegma pre- putii ”—under an elongated and tight foreskin, becomes a source of local irritation and inflammation fr'om uncleanhness. The irritation thus kept up leads to local excitement, and favours the development of the habit of early mastm’bation (Fig. 826). In some cases the preputial orifice is so tight as to interfere materially with the discharge of the urine, which passes from the urethra into a kind of pouch between the glans and prepuce, distends this structure, and is then squeezed in a fine jet or in a scattered sprinkling stream through the narrowed preputial orifice, as a consequence of this impediment; and irritability of the bladder, often presenting symptoms simulating calculus, may thus be set up. Calculous concretions may form between the glans and the prepuce in such cases as these, and have been known to do so in enormous quantities. "Whishaw, of Fyzabad, removed no [fewer than 426 calcuh, varying in size from a pin’s head to a small bean, fr'om this situation in the person of a native of India, 60 years of age, who came under treatment for what appeared to be a large tumour of the end of the penis, the true nature of which was not detected until in removing it the knife grated against the contained calcidi. Various affections of the genito-urinary organs in children, such as inconti- nence, intermittent flow of mine, hiematuria, priapism, &c., have been shown by Bryant to be owing to congenital phimosis. Sayre has pointed out the important fact that reflex paralysis and various forms of spastic con- tractions chiefly of the lower limbs are due to the same cause, being readily curable by circumcision. In addition to these I have seen general spasmodic affections in children resembling chorea, resulting from congenital phimosis. Vig. S26.—In-itatod Congeuital Plii- iiiosis..s 0 2 OPERATIONS FOR PHIMOSIS. 93^ At more advanced periods of life I have known it to be a cause of impotence, or rather as interfering with conception in the wife, by the semen after emis- sion being retained under the tight and. narrow prepuce until erection had completely subsided. Congenital phimosis especially becomes a source ol inconvenience in after-life if any gonorrhoeal or venereal disease be contracted, as it renders the exposure of the diseased part difficult or impossible, and interferes with the necessary treatment. In the opinion of some Surgeoms, cancer of the penis, if not directly occasioned, is at all events predisposed to, by congenital phimosis. Acquired Phimosis usually results from repeated attacks of inflammation, or of specific disease in the part, giving rise to solid oedema, or to false hyper- trophy of the prepuce. In elderly men, phimosis vdll sometimes slowly come on as a consequence of the initation set up by cracks, fissures, or superficial ulcerations forming round the preputial orifice, which becomes narrowed, so as to prevent the glans from being uncovered. The preputial mucous membrane becomes thickened, and can be felt like a broad band under the loose and possibly slightly cedematous integument of the prepuce. This condition is a source of much irritation and annoyance, and requires relief by dilatation or removal by circumcision. Treatment.—Every child who has a congenital phimosis ought to be circum- cised ; and even those who, without having phimosis, have an abnormally long and lax prepuce, would be improved greatly in cleanhness, health, and morals by being subjected to the same operation ; and it would be well if the custom of Eastern nations, whethm’ it be regarded as a religious rite or only a time- honoimed observance, were introduced amongst us. Phimosis, when not congenital, must be treated in accordance with its cause ; thus, if it have re- sulted from inflammation, that must be subdued; if from venereal disease, that must be remedied, when perhaps the contraction and elongation will gradually subside. If, however, the phimosis, though acquired, be permanent, it should be subjected to operation. Operations for Phimosis may be conducted on three plans ; the elongated and contracted prepuce may be dilated or slit up, or circumcision may be performed. 1. Dilatation of the Phimosis may be done by putting the patient under chloroform, introducing a pair of forceps, and opening them widely, tearing through the naiTOw preputial orifice and tight funnel-shaped mucous mem- brane ; or this may be slit up with a naiTow tenotome on each side, and then dilatation practised. This procedure may be usefully adopted if the prepuce l>e not very long and tight, or if any objection exist to circumcision as too severe an operation. In the acquired phimosis of old men, consequent upon contraction follow- ing cracks of the preputial margin, I have found that dilatation may safely and speedily be effected by the introduction of a two-bladed dilator, such as is iiscd for the female urethra, which, being gradually screwed open, causes the indurated circle to yield. 2. Slitting up of the Prepuce, whether upon its upper or under surface, is, I think, an objectionable procedure, leaving the prepuce of its abnormal length, and more or less fissured and knobbed. In all cases I prefer circum-932 DISEASES OF THE PENIS AND SCROTUM. cisioii as tlae simplest and speediest operation, and as leaving the most satis- factory result. 3. Circumcision for Congenital Phimosis in Boys.—It may be gathered from what has already been stated with respect to the evil effects resulting from congenital phimosis, that circumcision in this condition may be required to remove an elongated and possibly adlrerent prepuce, which oc- casions much local irritation, or which is the exciting causes of reflex and dis- tant nervous distm'bance of a paralytic or spastic character. So great are the evils resulting not only from congenital phimosis, but from an abnormally long, though not phimotic prepuce, that it is only humane and right from a moral point of view, to practise early circumcision in all such cases. This operation is easily and safely performed according to the Hebrew rite, which I have several times had an opportunity of •witnessing, and winch is done as follows. The child being held on the lap of an assistant, the operator draws the foreskin slightly forwards, and then grasps it just in front of the glans by dra\ving it thi’ough a slit in a silver guard. This is not held perpendicularly domiwards, but is inclined from above slightly forwards and downwards, so as to avoid cutting the frmnum as much as possible, and to slice off the prepuce in an oblique or quilled manner. This is done by one stroke of a broad round-ended knife. The mucous membrane is then torn open between the finger and thumb along the dorsum of the penis, and is tiuned back so as to be brought into con- tact -ndth the cut edge of the skin. A strip of dry lint is then t'wisted round the organ in the sulcus behind the glans, so as to keep back the mucous mem- brane, and also to restrain hmmorrhage by its pressm*e. Union is perfect in a few days. This operation, which is practised on the eighth day after bh’th, is very rarely attended by any ill consequences. I have, however, seen it in one case followed by fatal erysipelas, and have heard of another instance in which death occm’red from hgemorrhage. Circumcision in the Adult for Disease of the Prepuce may most conveniently be performed in the following way. The Sm’geon restrains hEemorrhage during the operation, by tying a tape tightly round the root of the- penis, or by compressing the organ in Clover’s ch’cumcision-toiu’niquet (Uio-s. 827, 828), a most useful instrument, which can be slackened or tight- ened at any time. He next draws the elongated prepuce slightly forwards, until that portion of it which corresponds to the back of the glans is brought933 CIRCUMCISION FOR DISEASE OF PREPUCE. jnsfc in front of that structure. He then seizes the projecting prepuce imme- diately in front of the glans with a pair of narrow-bladed polypus forceps, which he gives to an assistant, who must hold them tightly; or he grasps it and protects the glans by means of a plate (Fig. 829), which I have had constructed for this pmpose. With one sweep of the bistomy he cuts off all that portion of the integument which projects beyond the for- ceps, which are then taken away (Fig. 830). It will now bo found that ho has only removed a circle of skin, but that the mucous membrane lining it still tightly embraces the glans ; this he slits up, by introducing the point of a pair of scissors at the preputial orifice ; and then, trimming off the angles of the flaps of mucous membrane, and if ne- cessary snipping across the fraenum, he tm-ns back the mucous membrane, and attaches it to the edge of the cutaneous incision by five points of metalhc suture, two on each side and one at the fr£enum. Before introducing these, he will generally find it necessary to ligature a small Fig. 829.—Insti-umoiit for iiolcling tlie Pre- puce in Circiun- cisiou. artery on each side of the penis, and one or two in the fi’^num.

Paraphimosis.—In farcquMmosin the prepuce has been forcibly drawn back behind the glans, which becomes strangled by the pressure exercised by the preputial orifice, so that the parts cannot be replaced in proper relation to one another. This accident principally ocem-s in boys, or in individuals who have naturally a tight prepuce, and who, on imcovering the glans, find it diiticult to get this part of the organ back. This difficulty is speedily and greatly in- creased by the swelling from congestion that is set up in the constricted glans. Treatment.—This is sufficiently simple. The Surgeon should first try to • reduce the swollen organ. He may often succeed in doing this by seizing the body of the penis between the index and middle fingers of each hand, and then endeavoming to draw the prepuce for- wards, at the same time that he com- presses the glans between the two thumbs and pushes it back (Fig. 832). Should reduction not be effected in this way, the constricted and strangulating preputial orifice must be divided. In doing this, the Surgeon will observe that the glans is separated from the body of the penis by a deep and narrow sulcus, which is especially evident on the upper part of the organ. , This sulcus, Avhich is over- lapped on one side by the glans and on the other by a fold of integument, corresponds to the imier margin of the preputial orifice ; and it is by the division of this, in which the stricture is situated, that immediate relief -will be given. This operation may readily be done by di-awing the glans forwards, then passing the point of a narrow-bladed scalpel into the sulcus on the dorsum of the penis, and making a perpendicular incision about one-third of an inch in length through the integuments at the bottom of the groove directly across it (Fig. 833). In consequence of the great stretching of the parts, the incision will immediately gape widely ; so that, instead of being longitudinal, it ■\vill appear to be transverse ; and then reduction of the glans may readily be effected. Balanitis.—Inflammation of the prepuce commonly occurs as the result of local iiritation from want of cleanliness, not imfrequently set up by a gonorrhma. When confined to the ' prepuce, and constituting ialanitis, that structure is much swollen, infiltiated, and reddened, and, while the inflammation lasts, continues in a state of phimosis. When the mucous membrane of the glans is affected as well, con- stituting Posthitis, there is a good deal of irritation and smai'ting, together with muco-purulent discharge. Fig. 833.—Incision in Opera- tion for Paraphimosis. Fig. 832.—Reduction of Paraxdiimosis.PEllSISTENT PlilAPISM. 935 Treatment.—The disease requires to be treated on ordinary antiphlogistic principles. The continued application of lead lotion, with the internal admi- nistration of salines, will generally remove it; but in many instances the most elfectual plan will be found to consist in rapidly sweeping the inflamed sur- faces with a stick of nitrate of silver passed down between them on one side of the frainum, and carried round to the opposite side. Herpes of the Gians and Prepuce is characterised by the formation of small A’csiclcs or excoriated points upon the mucous membrane of this region, attended by much smarting and itching, and chiefly occm-ring in persons of a gouty habit of body, with an iiritable mucous membrane. Treatment—Tn\s, slight affection is often very rebellious to treatment. In many instances, local means alone will not suffice ; for, though relief may be obtained by powdering the part with the oxide of zinc, or by using slightly astringent and cooling lotions, yet no permanent benefit wiU be derived unless constitutional irritation be removed by treatment of a cooling or alterative character, modified according to the circumstances of the case. Hypertrophy of the Prepuce not nnfrequently occurs as the result of chronic imtation or disease ; it is usually of limited extent, and requires no special interference on the part of the Sm-geon ; but in some instances it may become so extensive as to require operative interference. The disease then usually consists of a sohd oedema of the areolar tissue of the prepuce and of the subintegumeutal structures of the body of the penis, the organ being very greatly enlarged and becoming club-shaped. In these cases circumcision of the hypertrophied prepuce, with the excision of a V-shaped piece from the dorsum of the penis, wiU usually be found to leave a good and satisfactory result. But a greater magnitude than this may be attained. Thus Vidal has related and figined a case that had attained such an enormous size, that the organ reached to below the knees, and was as large as a thigh. This monstrous growth was successfully excised. Warts on the penis have aheadybeen described. They may attain a very large size, as in Fig. 834, and are best treated by being snipped off with cmwed scissors. Horny Excrescences have been observed to spring from the gians penis. The most remarkable •case of this kind in record is one by Jewett of Con- necticut. It was that of a yoimg man, in whom, after operation for congenital phimosis and the removal of warts, a horn grew from the left side of the gians penis, and attained a size of three and a half inches in length by three-fourths of an inch in diameter at the base. It could be handled and cut without pain, and the patient “ was accustomed to amuse the inmates of the ward by lighting the end of the hom and allowing it to burn.” It was excised, and did not return. Persistent Priapism, lasting for many days, is occasionally met with, as the result in most cases of excessive venery. The erection of the penis is not accompanied by any sexual desire, but is attended with great pain, a sense of Fig. 834.—Warts on the Gians and inner side of Prepuce, -which is slit ui>.DISEASES OF TILE PENIS AND SCROTUM. weight about the pcriuajum, mueh anxietj^ and constitutional disturbanee. The organ is singularly hard and unyielding. The pathology of this condition is obscure. By some it has been considered as the result of extravasation of blood into the corpora cavernosa ; by others, as dependent on sympathetic or reflex nervous irritation. The olfect of treatment would lead to the inference that the latter view was coiTcct. The incisions into the corpora cavemosa to let out the blood supposed to be extravasated have been productive of no great result, u'hilst the erection has rapidly subsided under full doses of the bromide of potassium. Gangrene of tlie Penis.—Sloughing of the integuments of the penis, to a greater or less extent, not unfrequently oceurs in persons of broken constitu- tion as the result of inflammatory phimosis, simple or gonorrheal (Fig. 831); or in consequence of the invasion of syphilitic phagedsena, and indeed the glans and body of the organ may often be extensively destroyed by the latter cause. These various forms of the disease have been described in different parts of this work. The true idioyatMc gangrene of the j>enis is, however, a very rare disease ; and Demarquay, who has specially directed attention to it, finds but few instances of it in the records of surgery. It has chiefly been met with in people of advanced age or of broken constitution, who, whilst sufiering from some local disease of the organ, have been affected by acute febrile disease, such as typhoid or smaU-pox, or have become the subjects of pytemia. In some cases it is probably embolic. The disease, when affecting the body of the penis, is often fatal—possibly by hajmorrhage on the separation of the slough. When the glans only is attacked, the prospect is better. But in either case— especially in the former—mutilation of the organ to a serious extent wiU result. The Treatment of gangrene of the penis presents nothing special, with the exception of restraining htemorrhage by means of the actual cautery, and preventing or repairing loss of substance in the lu’ethral wall, if it have been invaded by the disease and involved in the destruction resulting. Pibroid Tumour of the Penis.—The penis may be the seat of fibroid and other tumours. The accompanying drawing (Fig. Fig. 835. — Filiroid Tu- nioiu- of tlie Penis, success- fully removed. affection. 885) is an illustration of one Avhich I removed some years ago from the under surface of the organ. Cancer of the Penis is of two distinct kinds, occur- ring as Scirrhus or as Epithelioma. ^\Tien cancer assumes the° Scirrhous form, it usually springs from the sulcus behind the glans, and may thence invade the neighboiu- ing portion of the organ. It may assume the piimary form either of a tubercle or of infiltrated cancer of the glans. It has been supposed, and with some show of reason, that congenital phimosis predisposes to the affec- tion ; probably by confining the secretions, and thus keep- ing up irritation of the part. Hey fomid that, of 12 patients with this disease who came under his observa- tion, 9 had congenital phimosis ; and Travel's states that Jews, who are circumcised, are seldom subject to this But as they are a limited community in this coimtry, and as theTREATMENT OF CANCER OF THE PENIS. 937 Fis 836. —Epithelioma of the Penis. disease is rare, Ave cannot draw any conclusive inference from this observa- tion. It is, howei'er, very probable that the epithelial form of the disease may arise from the local irritation resulting from congenital phimosis. The scin-hous form of the affection, however, can occiu- in indiidduals who have not suffered from jihimosis ; of this I have seen several instances at the University College Hospital. Epitlielioma, commencing as a tubercle in the prepuce, may, after a time, gii'C rise to a large irregular and sprouting mass, having a granular fungous appearance, bleeding with much fetid discharge, gTOW- iiig rapidly, eiiA'eloping and at last implicating the glans (Fig. 830). In other cases it commences as a hard scirrhous mass of a pale reddish-white colour, situated on the glans, or between the prepuce and the glans. This increases in size, at last cracks, and allows a serous fetid discharge to exude. Ulceration then rapidly takes place. Sometimes the disease appears to be very distinctly locahsed; but after its removal it Avill always present the character of infiltrated cancer. It is, I believe, always primarily situated at the anterior extremity of the penis, not occiuTing in the body of the organ except as a secondaiy dejiosit. Diagnosis.—Epithelioma of the penis requires to be diagnosed fr'om fungoid loarts. This may usually be done readily enough, by comparing the indm-ated state of the malignant with the soft and lax condition of the non-malignant affection. From chancrous induration of the glans, the history of the case and the way in Avhich it is infiuenced by treatment AAnU enable the Surgeon to effect the diagnosis of scirrhus. In indurated lolastic effusmis into the corpus spongiosum, no pain is experienced, and the disease remains in a stationary condition. Treatment.—The treatment of cancer of the penis will vary accordmg to the natiu-e and extent of the malignant affection. In the Epithelial form of the disease the Surgeon may, if he see the case early, whilst the morbid growth is small and limited to the prepuce, content himself with chssecting off the affected patch. Should the epithehoma, how- ever, haA^e attained a large size (Fig. 836), and more particularly if it have implicated the glans, then amputation of the organ is indicated. ihe treatment of Cancer of the"penis must be conducted on the principles that guide us in the management of malignant affections whereA'er situated ; viz., to remove the diseased organ at as early a stage as j)ossible, whilst the affection is locahsed, before the glands are implicated and the constitution poisoned. In the penis, this may readily be done by an operation that is snnple in its execution and nearly devoid of danger. In many cases a return may take place, and that speedily, either in the part itself or in the neighbouring lymphatic glands ; yet, even if this occur, it is clearly the duty of the Surgeon to rid the patient of a loathsome disease, and to put him in a state of comparative comfort for some time ; the more so, as there is reason to believe that, in some instances, the disease may be entirely extirpated from the system, evincing no tendency to return. Indeed, I believe938 DISEASES OF THE PENIS AND SCROTUM. that amputation of the penis for cancer is more successful in its results than ( IS the extirpation of malignant growths from most other situations. In the i epithelial form of the disease it is especially a useful operation. In some of ' Hoy’s cases, which continued under his observation, there was no recurrence ■ of the disease for several years. 1 have seen several patients who, after a : lapse of six or eight years, have continued free from a recurrence of the disease ; and I have also seen a gentleman who had his penis amputated for cancer more than twenty-five years ago, and in whom no return has taken place. The . fact is, that we see and hear of those cases in which a recun-ence takes place ; but those patients who remain free from a return of the afiection do not divulge , their infirmity; and it is exceedingly rare in hospital practice to find a patient ' come back with recurrent cancer in the stump of the penis, which he would | certainly do if relapse took place. In those cases in which the operation is i not successful, it has usually been delayed too long, the disease having already ' implicated the lymphatic glands in the groin, and thus contaminated the patient’s constitution. I Amputation of the Penis may be practised either with the knife or with | the dcrasem*. Whichever instrument is used, the operation should always be 1 performed towards the root of the organ, so as to be well clear of the disease ; at the same time, care must be taken not to remove the organ too near the pubes, lest the stump retract under that bone. Before proceeding to operate, means must be taken to restrain undue haemorrhage. This is best done by [ tying a narrow tape tightly round the root of the penis, or by encirchng this j part by Clover’s tommiquet (Figs. 827, 828), appfied as in cncumcision, only j nearer to the pubes and more tightly. The operation with the knife may | readily be done by the Surgeon putting the penis upon the stretch, drawing j the integument weU forward, and then severing the organ at one stroke of the bistoury. As the corpora cavernosa retract more than the integument, ! it is well not to leave too much skin ; lest the flap, falling over the face of the stump, make the search for any bleeding vessels somewhat difiicult, and i afterwards pucker inconveniently. There aic usually five arteries requiring ! ligatm-e : the dorsales penis, one in each corpus cavernosum, and one in the septum. In securmg these, trouble is not unfrequently experienced in con- sequence of the retraction of the stump that is left. The danger of htemor- rhage scarcely exists if the tape or the tommiquet have been properly appfied before the operation, as every artery should be secured before the compression is taken off. By these means we may prevent the reti’action of the stmnj), which may otherwise cause it to be buried imder the pubic arch, almost in the perinmum. Should it do so, and oozing continue, a female catheter must be passed into the m’ethi-a, and a fii-m compress appfied with a T-bandage. During and after cicatrisation, the methi’a! orifice has a tendency to contract. The liability to this may, however, be lessened by slitting up the lower wall ■ of the m’ethra with sharp-pointed scissors for about a quarter of an inch, drawing forwai’d the mucous membrane, and then stitching it to the edge of the cut skin. If the amputation be performed high up, this may be some- what difiicult; and then it may be safer to introduce an elastic catheter before the operation, to perform the amputation upon and through this, and to lea’s e it in dining cicatrisation. When the ecraseur is used, the skin shouldINFLAMMATORY (EDEMA OF SCROTUM. 939 similarly be drawn forwards, and the instrument worked slowly, so as to divide the organ, if possible, without indueing haimorrhage. During the healing, the cut surfaces should be kept scrupulously clean with antiseptics, lest septic poisoning takes place, which may readily occim in so spongy and vascular an organ. . I have employed the galvanic ticraseur with 'gveat success in removal oi the penis. The operation thus performed is bloodless. The plan that I adopt is as follows. A full-sized silver catheter having no rings is first passed into the bladder, and is retained there during and after the operation. A naiTOw tape is then tied round the root of the penis to compress the vessels. The wire of the (•craseul- is next slipped over the fore part of the organ, and is worked until the tissues are divided through to the catheter. The separated portion of the penis is then slipped off over the catheter, which is tied in. The object of passing the catheter before dividing the organ is to avoid the difficulty that often occurs in finding the urethral aperture in the stump when compressed and seai’cd by the wire, and the object of retaining it is to prevent contraction of that orifice diu’ing cicatrisation. After amputation of the penis, the lu’ine will not be projected forwards, but always passes directly downwards between the legs. Any inconvenience in this respect may best be avoided by following Ambrose Fare’s advice of adapt- ing a funnel, which may be made of metal or ivory, to the pubes over the stump, and thus carrying the lu’ine clear of the person. Other tumours besides cancer are occasionally met with in the penis. I have seen Encysted Tumours and Ncevus situated under the prepuce (p. 942, Vol. I.); and Fibrous or Fibro-Plastic Tumour may occiu’ in the corpora cavernosa. Such morbid growths if small can readily be removed without injmy to the rest of the organ; if large, they may require its amputation. DISEASES OF THE SCKOTUM. Inflammatory (Edema of the scrotum is an erysipelatous inflammation of this region, and derives its chief peculiarity from the circumstance of its giving- rise to great effusion into and swelling of the areolar tissue of this part and of . the penis, with a tendency to the rapid formation of slough in it, by Avhich the integument may likewise become affected to such an extent that the testes and cords speedily become denuded. This disease usually originates from some local source of uritation, as fissm-es, cracks, or lu'inary extravasation (p. 702, A^ol. I.). There is a peculiar and specific form of “inflammatory oedema ” of the scrotum and penis, which is apt to occiu’ as a sequence of smaU pox and scarlet fever. In this form of the disease rapid and extensh^e infiltration of the parts occurs, Avith a tendency to speedy gangrenous disorganisation of the areolar tissue and skin covering the organs of generation. Treatment.—This consists in elevating the scrotum, fomenting it Avell, and making early and free incisions into it, particularly at the posterior and dependent parts of the scrotum and penis, Avith the review of relie-ving the tension to Avhich the tissue is subjected by the effusion into its cells, and thus preventing the liability to slough. Should this occm-, the case must be treated on ordinary principles, Avhen cicatrisation will speedily ensue, however extensive940 JDISEA8ES OF THE PENIS AND tlic denudation of parts may be SCROTUM. 1 , - u constitutional management must always be conducted in accordance with those principles laid down in the first division of this work, and with special attention to the maintenance of the patient’s strength. Hypertrophy of the scrotmn seldom occurs in this country, though Liston once had occasion to remove such a mass, weighing 44 lbs.; but in some tropical regions, particidarly India and China, it is of frequent occiuTencc, and may go on until it attain an enormous bulk, forming a tumour nearly as laro-© as the trunk, and perhaps weighing GO or 70 lbs. These enormous growths are of simple character, and constitute the disease termed Elejjliantiasis of the scrotum. Fig. 837 represents a tumour of this kind, weighing 40 lbs., which was successfully removed by Eogers of the Mauritius. It is taken ft’om a photo- •g'rajih of the case, kindly sent to me by that gentleman. Treatment.—Tumours of this kind necessarily require extirpation. In per- forming such operations, there are two points that demand special attention; the first is to preserve the penis and testes if possible, which will usually be c,. on- . found buried towards the upper part Fig. S3 (.—Elephantiasis of the Scrotum. „ 01 the mass, and may be saved if the tumour be of small size; and the second is, to endeavour to prevent the haimorrhage from being too profuse. With this view, the operation ought not only to be performed as rapidly as possible, but the advice given by O’FerraU of elevating the tumour above the level of the body, for some time before its removal, so as to empty it of its blood, may be advantageously adopted. In addition to this, Esmarch’s toiimiquet should be applied round the neck of the tumour and the pelvis. If the gi-owth be very large, it will be better not to make any attempt at saving the testes or penis, which could only be dissected out by a long and tedious operation, in the course of which there would be danger of the patient dying of hiemorrhage. Epithelioma occasionally affects the scrotum; and, as it principally occurs in chimney-sweepers, it has been appropriately enough termed Ghimneu- swee])efi's Cancer. This affection appears to arise from the mitation of the soot lodging in the folds of the scrotum. It commonly commences as a tubercle or wart, which after a time cracks or ulcerates, presenting the ordi- nary characters of a cancerous ulceration. It rapidly spreads, involving at last the greater part of the scrotum, and perhaps invading the testis. After a time, the inguinal and pelvic glands will be affected; and the patient, if deprived of his covering of soot, ■will be found to be cachectic-looking. The Treatment consists in excising widely the diseased portion of the scrotum, provided the inguinal glands be not invofred, or the patient’s consti- tution poisoned. The disease has a great tendency to return, and it is seldom that the patient long escapes with life when once he has been affected by it.MALPOSITION OF THE TESTIS. 941 CHAPTER LXXIV. —•— . DISEASES OF THE TESTIS AND CORD. MALPOSITION OP THE TESTIS. The testes are, in tlie foetus, lumbar organs lying below the kidneys, and in the normal condition descend into the scrotum a short time before birth. From some arrest of deyelopment, this descent may be retarded on one or both sides ; and in other instances it is never completed. An undescended testis , may continue to lie within the cavity of the abdomen ; or it may find its way into the internal ring ; or may become engaged in the inguinal canal, lying above the external abdominal ring, or it may project just beyond this, not passing into the scrotum. In these several situations it may remain quiescent; but it may become the seat of inflammation or of structiu-al degeneration, simple or malignant. It may also, when nndescended, as has been stated at p. 659, Yol. II., become complicated with or mistaken for a hernia, and may present many diagnostic difficulties. Inflammation of the testis retained in the canal will be considered at p. 945. When an inidescended testis becomes the seat of structinal disease, it may require removal from the canal. The testis may be met with in other abnormal situations ; thus some time ago I saw a case in which one of these organs was situated in the perinmum, close by the anus, having apparently missed the scrotum ; and cases have occurred in which they have been met with in the interior of the pelvis. The organ may sometimes be tmned hindside forwards, being retroverted, so that the epididymis is placed in front. In a case of this kind which I had an oppor- tunity of examining after detd^h a few years ago, the epipidymis and vas deferens were considerably larger than natural. If a hydrocele form in such a case, it will be seated behind the testis. There is a very important question connected with malposition of the testis, viz. Is the organ when undescended prolific ? There is reason to believe that it is not. Such testes are small, hard, and granular in structure ; and, when they are examined under the microscope, spermatozoa are not found in them. When only one testis is undescended, the other one, being- in its proper position, cam’es on the functions of the two organs ; but when both testes are retained in the canal or in the abdomen, being undescended, the indi\idual who is the subject of such malposition will most probably be sterile. He may have the usual erotic feelings, full power of erection, and of emission of a spermatic fluid ; but the secretion will proljably have no fecundating power.942 DISEASES OF THE TESTIS AND CORD. NEURALaiA OF THE 0?ESTIS. A painful or irritable condition of the testicle may occur without any actual disease of the organ ; the pain being either seated in the epididymis, which is the part naturally the most tender, in the body of the testis, or stretching along the cord to the loins and groins. It is usually paroxysmal, and is accompanied by great tenderness, and commonly by some fulness of the organ, which feels soft and flaccid ; but it is difficult to make a proper examination, on aeeount of the agony that is induced by touching the part. This disease chiefly occurs in young men of a nervous and excitable temperament, and is frequently associated with gTeat mental disquietude and despondency, often amounting to a suicidal tendency. The Causes are obscure ; in many cases the disease appears to he connected with a neuralgic temperament, but in others it is associated with some dyspeptic disorder, or may be dependent upon local initation ; thus external piles, or the pressm-e of a varicocele, will often give rise to it. The disease is usually of a very chronic character. In some instances, how- ever, it ceases spontaneously, after having lasted for weeks or months. Treatment.—When the neuralgia is dependent upon constitutional causes, the treatment is extremely unsatisfactory. The administration of tonics, such as iron, zinc, or quinine, the local application of sedatives, as of atropine ointment or the tincture of aconite, may be of service. In other cases, cold bathing or douching will he beneficial; and, in aU, keeping the part supported with a suspensory bandage will be advantageous. In the event of there being any local initation, that should be removed ; thus I have known the disease to cease after the excision of external piles ; and when it is connected with varicocele, proper measures must be adopted for the relief of that afiection. In extreme cases. Sir A. Cooper recommends castration ; but such .a pro- ceeding is altogether unjustifiable in a disease that is either constitutional, or dependent on local causes which are readily removable. INFLAMMATION OF THE TESTIS. Inflammation of the Testicle, considering the organ as a whole, may be of two distinct kinds, varying as to seat and as to cause. Thus it may he seated in the body of the organ, constituting Orchitis; or the epididymis may alone be affected, constituting Epididymitis. As to cause, it may be rheumatic, traumatic, or gonorrhoeal. Acute Inflammation.—The Seat of the inflammation, at the commence- ment of the disease, depends greatly upon the cause, which may be in the urinary passages or elsewhere. Irritation in any part of the urethra, occa- sioned by the passage of instruments, by the lodgment of calcuh,^ or by gonorrhoeal inflammation, usually causes the epididymis to be primarily affected, and the body of the organ to be inflamed in a secondary manner. When, on the other hand, the inflammation comes on fi'om injuries, blows, strains, or other causes acting generally, the body of the testis is tisuafly first affected. To all this, however, exceptions will often occur ; and orcffitis may sunervene as the result of gonoiThcca, or epididymitis from a i on. i&943 ATROPHY OF THE TESTIS. orchitis in such cases is in all probohility a kind of constitutional affection, intimately associated with inflammation of other fibrous tissues, especially with gonorrhoeal rheumatism ; the inflammation of the epididymis, arising fi-om gonorrhoea or other irritation of the m-inary passage, appearing to result from direct extension of morbid action along the vas deferens. Si/mpfoms.—These necessarily vary to a certain extent, not only according as the disease is of an acute or of a chronic character, but as it primarily affects the body of the testis or the epididymis. When it commences in the latter structure, it is the inferior globus that is commonly first affected, which becomes swollen, hard, and tender. The disease may be confined throughout to this part; but most frequently it invades the whole of the organ, which becomes unifoimly enlarged and somewhat ovoid ; it is frequently accompanied by a good deal of effusion into the tunica vaginalis, then constituting the Acute ’Hydrocele of Velpeau. As the inflammation subsides, the different characters presented by the enlargement of the two constituents of the organ again become apparent. The swelling is therefore due partly to general enlarge- ment of the organ, but in some cases to inflammatory effusion into tne tunica vaginalis; and this effusion may either be purely serous, or partly. , plastic. The pain is always very severe, with much tenderness and a sensation of weight, and commonly extends up the cord into the groin and loin. It is generally greatest when the body of the testis is affected, owing probably to the enveloping fibrous tunic preventing the expansion of the organ. Hence it is often spasmodic and paroxysmal, extending up the course of the cord. There are usually considerable swelling and redness of the scrotum, with turgescence of the scrotal veins, and a congested state of the cord, with sharp pyrexia, nausea, and perhaps occasional vomiting. As the disease subsides, the body of the testis first resumes its normal character and shape, the epididymis often continuing hardened and enlarged for a considerable period. In fact, the induration that forms in the epidi- dymis may become somewhat permanent, owing to the effusion of j)lastic matter into it, leaving a hardened mass, and implicating the whole or a portion of its convolutions. Atrophy of the Testis is more liable to follow the metastatic orchitis of mumps in young men above the age of puberty than any other form of inflammation of the organ. It is remarkable how rapid and how complete the wasting of the testis will be in these cases. A few weeks after the subsid- ence of the inflammation the testis will be found to be shrunk away, so as to form a small soft mass not larger than a filbert. Atrophy of the testis may also sometimes gradually ensue as a result of chronic epididymitis, and the consequent induration of this structure. Stran- gulation of the vascular supply to the testis occurs, and the whole organ at last wastes so as to leave nothing but a small hardened mass in the scrotum. Gosselin has shown that this induration of the epididymis following inflamma- tion frequently causes complete obstruetion of the canal, and if occurring on both sides produces sterility. In 10 such cases he found spermatozoa absent from the semen, and the patients consequently incapable of procreation, although the appearance of the testes and of their secretion was scarcely944 DISEASES OF THE TESTIS AND CORD. altered, and the virile powers of the patients remained unimpaired Curlino- also mentions several such cases, and points out the necessity of continuing the treatment of epididymitis until the last trace of induration has disappeared. At a later period, treatment is almost useless. Subacute Orchitis usually comes on with the same symptoms, thoimh in a less marked form than in the acute variety. This swelling, however, is'^con- siderable, though of a softer kind. When the disease is chronic, the testis often becomes permanently enlarged and hardened, assuming an oval shape, being smooth, hea'vy, and uniiormly expanded, with a sensation of weight, dragging, apd severe pain, and a good deal of tenderness on pressme. This form of orchitis occasionally occurs in old people. Orchitis may occm* idiopathically, without any assignable cause in the way of external injmy or local irritation in the urethra or prostate. This form of the disease is most common in middle-aged men, and more especially in those who lare gouty. In fact the disease is in all probability one of the many local forms of gouty inflammation. It is not very acute but hngering, liable to recurrence, and to be followed either by hydrocele or chronic indurations of the epididymis. Treatment.—The treatment of Acutely Inflamecl Testicle, whether local or constitutional, is essentially antiphlogistic. Blood should be abstracted from the part by puncturing the veins of the scrotum—a far better method than applying leeches, the bites of which are apt to become irritated. This little operation may be very effectually done by du’ecting the patient to stand up, and to foment the scrotum for a few minutes with a hot sponge, so as to distend the veins ; these may then be pnuctm’ed at various points Avith a flne lancet, and the parts well fomented afterwards, so as to encourage the floAV of blood. In this way six or eight ounces may be taken iu the course of a few minutes ; when enough has escaped, the further flow may be aiTested by laying the patient doAvn and elevating the part. The patient should be kept in bed with the testis raised on a small pillow between the thighs, poppy fomentations being diligently applied. If there be much effusion into the tunica vaginalis, constituting acute hydrocele, relief may be afforded by puncturing this sac with the point of the lancet. The Constitutional Treatment during the acute stage consists in the adminis- tration of salines and antimony, with henbane in full doses, so as to give an aperient, a diaphoretic, and a sedative together ; when this begins to act, great relief is usually afforded. As the inflammation subsides, the treatment must be changed. When there is merely swelling and hardness left, with but little pain or tenderness, the testis may advantageously be strapped with adhesive plaster, so as to give good support and to promote absorption of plastic matter. Fricke of Hamburg has | strongly recommended strapping in the acute stage; but I cannot say that I have ever seen any advantages derived from it at this period of the disease, i though I have many times seen it tried ; it has usually appeared to me to increase, sometimes very considerably, the pain in the part, and the general uneasiness. In Subacute Orchitis much Ijenefit is usually derived from a short course of Dover’s powder and calomel, with early strapping of the testis. hen theTXFLAMMATJOX OF TESTIS IX IXGUIXAL CAiYAL. 945 oro'an has become enlarg-ed and indurated, as the result ot chronic inflam- mation, it may he advantageously strapped cither with simple plaster, or with one composed of equal parts of the emplastrum ammoniaci cum hydrargyro and soap-plaster ; mercury in small doses, more especially the bichloride, being coiitiniied for some length of time, until the plastic matter is absorbed and the hardness disappears. In Strapping a Testicle, the scrotum should be shaved, and then di-awn tightly upwards on the affected side. The Surgeon should next pass a long strip of plaster, above an inch broad, above the enlarged testicle and loiind the coiTcsponding side of the scrotum, so as to isolate it, as it veie. Anothei strip is now passed from behind, in a longitudinal direction, ovei the lowei end of the testis, and upwards upon the anterior part of the scrotum; and thus, by a succession of horizontal and vertical strips, neatly overlapping and drami tightly, the organ is completely enveloped and compressed. To bo of any service, the strapping must be tightly and evenly applied ; but at the same time care must be taken not to strangulate the scrotum by drawing down the upper strips of plaster too forcibly. In a case of “ tuberculo- s}"philitic ” disease of the testis, in which I was obliged to have recourse to castration, the whole of the side of the scrotum had sloughed away, lea^ung the testis exposed and fungating, in consequence of the tight strapping which had been employed before the case came into my hands. Abscess, as the result of inflammation of the testis, is of rare occurrence : sometimes, however, the scrotum inflames at one point, where fluctuation becomes apparent, with thinned skin and evident signs of suppuration ; a puncture should here be made, and the pus let out as soon as formed. Some- times abscess may occur in another way ; inflammation is set up in the tunica albuginea, adhesion takes place between the testis and the scrotum, abscess forms under the fibrous coat, and, this giving way, the pus gets vent externally through the integuments. Into the aperture that necessarily results a portion of the secreting tissue of the gland sometimes projects, and, becoming inflamed, fonns a red, granular, and fungous mass, protruding through and overlapping the edges of the aperture. The treatment of this condition will be considered when Ave come to speak of the scrofulous testicle. lufLammation of the Testis in the Inguinal Canal may sometimes take place, even in adults, when the organ has not descended through the ■external ring ; giving rise to a train of somew^hat puzzling symptoms which elosely resemble those of strangulated incomplete hernia; with Avhich, how- ever, it must be borne in mind that it may be associated (p. G.50, vol. II). On examination, a large in-egular tumour, in some parts hard, in others soft, very tender to the touch, and occasioning a sickening sensation when pressed, Avill be found in one of the groins, in the situation of the inguinal canal. Tliere are usually a tendency to vomiting and some constipation, Avith colicky pains in the abdomen. These symptoms, hoAVCA-er, are generally not very persistent, and the constipation readily yields to the administration of pur- gatives. On examining the scrotum, it will be found that the testis on the affected side is absent; and, on passing the finger into the external ring, the organ can be felt to be lodged in the canal. In consequence of the proximity of the peritoneum to the inflamed testis, this membrane occasionally becomes VOL.

Either of these conditions may lead to a fatal termination. The Treatment should be actively antiphlogistic. Leeches must be fi-eely applied o^'er the part, and blood should be taken from the am, if the patient be young and strong ; salines with antimony being at the same time adminis- tered, and fomentations diligently persevered in. Iiiflammation and Abscess of the Cord.—In some cases the inflam- mation of the testis may extend, or the disease may, from the first, be limited, to the areolar tissue of the cord, giving rise to tumefaction, with a good deal of pain and tenderness along it, and eventually abscess, accompanied by the usual signs of suppuration. The Treatment of such a case must be conducted on ordinary iDrinciples, early discharge for the pus being secured. Chronic Orchitis of a persistent character constitutes a distinct disease of the testis, so closely allied to some forms of tumour of this organ in its cha- racter and pathology, that it will be more convenient to consider it with the Sarcoceles (p. 900). HYDBOCELB AND H.ffi]MATOCELE. By Hydrocele is meant an accumulation of serous fluid, formed in connec- tion with the testis or cord. Most frequently the fluid occupies the sac of the tunica vaginalis, constituting a true dropsy of it; in other instances, it appears to be formed in distinct cysts, situated either in connection with the testis, or upon the cord. Hence hydroceles are commonly divided into those that affect the Tunica Vaginalis, and the Encysted variety. Hydiiocele oe the Tunica Vaginalis may occm- as the result of acute orchitis ; the inflammation of the testis causing the effusion of a quantity of limpid fluid into its serous investment (p. 943). This, however, is not the kind of hydi-ocele that is commonly met with ; the fluid so poured out as the result of active inflammation usually becoming absorbed as the parts recover their normal condition. The ordinary hydrocele occurs as a chronic disease, with- out any signs of inflammation of the testicle, or, at most, with but slight tendeniess of that organ. It is most fr-equently met with in individuals about the middle period of life, commouly without any evident exciting cause, either constitutional or local. It is very common in men who have hved long in warm climates, and Fayrer considers it in some cases to have a malarial origin. In young infants, hydrocele is not unfr-equently seen, and in them it may affect two forms : either the ordinary one, similar to that which occurs in adults in whom the timica vaginalis constitutes a closed sac filled with fluid ; or a less common variety, in which the accumulation of fluid in the tunica A’aginalis communicates, by the jiersistence of a canal in the funicular pro- longation of the peritoneum investing the cord, with the general cavity of , that membrane. This form of hydrocele is Congenital; and the fluid in it occupies the same position that intestine does in a congenital hernia. It ma} readily be recognised by the fluid being made to flow back into the general peritoneal cavity, on raising or squeezing the tumour. But, although this may be considered to be the true congenital form of hydrocele in influits, the otherSY}rPTOMS OF lIYDliOCELF. 947 variety of the disease also occurs in them when but a few days old, and very at"fii-st bo soft,"but after a while becomes hard and tense; or it may be so ii-om the commencement. AVhatover its original condition, the tumour soon becomes oval or pyi-iform in shape, being narrowed above, rounded and broad lielow : it is suiooth and uniformly tense and hard, often having a semi-elastic feel. It reaches upwards along the cord, towards the external abdominal ring, which, however, is rarely invaded by it, and the cord is usually distinctly to be felt above the upper margin of the tumour. Most commonly the size varies from that of a hen’s egg to a small cocoa-nut; but sometimes it may attain a considerably greater magnitude than this, and will then cause much incon- venience, as it reaches up close to the external ring, and drags over the penis, causing that organ to be buried in it, so as to interfeie with mictuiition. Gibbon the historian had an enormous hydrocele, which was tapped by Cline, who drew off six quarts of fluid. The most characteristic sign of hydrocele is its translucency by transmitted light. This may always be detected by the Surgeon grasping the posterior part of the tumoiu- with one hand, so as to put the integuments of the fore part on the stretch, then placing the edge of the other hand along the most promi- nent part of the swelling, and having a lighted candle held close behind. On making this examination, the tumour will appear translucent; if, however, the walls of the sac be thick, or the fluid dark, the transmission of light through it may not be perceived unless the examination be conducted in a darkened room. Another very simple and efficient method of determining the translucency is by putting the end of a stethoscope against the tumour, and looking down the tube against the light. IVe have already seen that the ordinary hydrocele of the tunica vaginalis may vary as to size : it may also differ as to shape ; in some cases being globular, in others constricted in the middle, or of an hour-glass shape. The quantity of liquid varies considerably ; there are usually from six to twelve or twenty oimces, but I have known a hydrocele to contain more than one hundred and twenty ounces. The fluid is generally clear and limpid, and of a straw-colour ; but in very large and old hydroceles it may become of a dark-brownish or chocolate hue, owing to the admixture of disintegrated blood ; and it will then be found to contain flakes of cholesterine. The sac is usually thin ; but in some old cases it becomes thick and dense, lined by a kind of false membrane, and divided by septa or bands, occasionally to such an extent as almost to separate it into distinct compartments. When the sac is thick, and the fluid opaque and turbid, there may be considerable difficulty in detecting the translucency. The testis is generally somewhat enlarged, especially about the epididymis, and frequently slightly tender, more particularly in the early stages of the complaint. It is almost invariably situated in the posterior part of the sac ( Fig. 888), but may sometimes be found towards its anterior part. When this is the case, the epididymis will be found turned towards the front, owing to the organ being retroverted. 8 p 2948 DISEASES OF THE TESTIS AND CORD. Ilie Coverings of a hydrocele are the same as tliose of the testis. Besides the integumental sti’uctiires, aponeurotic prolongations from the intercolnmnar and cremasteric fasciae may be traced over the surface of the swelling (Fig. 839). Treatment.—The treatment of hydrocele is divided into the Palliative and Curative. By Cos, ^palliative treatment the Siu-geon simply seeks to relieve the patient of the annoyance induced by the bulk or weight of the tumour ; but the curative has for its object the permanent removal of the disease. , The Palliative Treatment consists in the use of a suspensory bandage and cooling lotion, or in tapping with a fine trochar. These simple means, how- e’S'er, will sometimes succeed in effecting a radical cm’e. Thus, in infants it will happen that the application of evaporating and discntient lotions may remove the effused fluid ; and indeed it is seldom that any other plan of treatment than tliis is required in yomig children. The best lotion for the purpose consists of one composed of 5j of muriate of ammonia, 5j of spirits of wine, and 3viij of water; with this the scrotum should be kept constantly wetted ; and, if there be a communication with the peritoneum, a truss should be kept applied OA'er the external ring. In adults it occasionally happens that simple tapping of the tumour has effected a radical cure. Some years ago, a gentleman from Cuba consulted me for a small hydrocele which had been forming for several months ; I tapped it with a fine trochar, and drew off about five ounces of fluid. This was followed by a radical cure. This case bears out a remark made by Brodie, that the few instances in Avhich he had known simple tapping to produce a radical cure occurred in West Indians. I have, however, several times seen hydroceles disairpear after having been tapped a few times, without any other treatment, in persons Avho had ncA'er been in hot climates. This simple operation is not altogether, howeA'er, destitute of danger; Fig. 838.—Hydrocele of the Tunica Vaginalis laid open. Fig. 839.—Dissection of a Hydrocele, sho\ving its Coreringk949 TREATMENT OF JlYDROGELE. I have known an old man to die from inflammatory after having been tapped. After tapping, it usually happens that hydro- cele slowly forms again, attaining its former bulk at the end of a or months. Occasionally it will be found that the hydi-occle returns more and more slowly after each tapping ; so that, by repcatmg_ this sirnple process at intervals of three, then six, then twelve months, the disease will finally isap- pcar. This kind of progressive cure by simple tapping I have several times seen, chiefly in old men. When a congenital hydrocele has been tapped, the sac soon fills again by drainage into it from the peritoneum ; and indeed, in such a case the fluid of an ascites has been drawn off by tapping the tunica vaginalis. ■ ■ ^ ^ ■ Jn tapping a hydrocele a few precautions are necessary, the prmcipai being to avoid puncturing one of the scrotal veins, or injuring the testis. In the majority of cases the testis is situated at the back of the tu- mour, and is consequently alto- gether out of the Avay of the tro- char, if this be introduced as it shoidd be, by the Siu'geon putting the anterior part of the hydrocele on the stretch by gTasping it be- hind with his left hand, and then pushing the trochar into the lower part of its middle third in front, carrying the instrument at first directly backwards (Fig. 840, a), but, as soon as it has perforated the sac, directing its point upwards (Fig. 840, V). If the testicle have been found, cither by pressing the swelling and observing the sensation of pain thus pro- duced in the patient, or on examination with a lighted candle, to be on the fore part of the tumour, where it may sometimes be felt as Avell as seen, the hydrocele should be tapped at the side or behind. Before using the trochar, it is well to see that the cannula fits closely round the neck of the stylet; and, above all, that the instrument has not become rusty by having been carelessly put aside after use on a previous occasion. As the fluid of the hydi’oeele escapes, it will sometimes be seen to acquire a pulsatory movement, appa- rently communicated to it by the arteries of the cord. The Curative Treatment has for its object the excitation of a sufficient degree of inflammation in the tunica vaginalis to restore the lost balanee between secretion and absorption ; but it is not necessary that the serous cavity should be obliterated by adhesions between its opposite sides, though these not unfrcquently take place. The means by which the Surgeon sets up this inflammation are either throwing a stimulating injection into that cavity after tapping it, or the introduction of a small seton into the tunica vaginalis. hichever plan is adopted, a certain amount of inflammation ought to be set up. This is always attended by considerable swelling of the testis, and by the ctlusion of a fi'csh quantity of fluid into the tunica vaginalis. As this is absorbed, the part gradually resumes its noimal bulk, and the disease will probably not return. Fig. 840.—Tapiiing in Hydrocele : a, Introduction of Troclmr : h, Position of Cannula.95° diseases of THE TESTIS AND CORD. Tn order that the radical cure, in whichever way undertaken, should be safe and efficient, it is necessary, in the first instance, that the disease should ha\-c been allowed to attain a chronic condition, more particularly if the hydrocele have been of rapid growth. In order to prevent its attaining too large a size, it will be well to adopt palliative tapping once or twice before attempting the radical cure. Care must also be taken to remove all inflammation and tender- ness about the testis, before having recourse to this means of treatment. If attention be not paid to this, recurrence of the hydrocele will probably ensue. After the proper amount of inflammation has been set up, it will be well to treat the patient as if he were suffering under an ordinary attack of orchitis, confining him to the bed or to the couch for a few days ; indeed, care in the after-treatment is of very considerable importance in securing a favom'able result. The treatment by Injection is that which is commonly employed. It consists in tapping the tumour in the usual way, and then throwing a sufficient quantity of stimulating fluid into the tunica vaginalis through the cannula, so as to excite a proper amount of inflammation in it. The liquids that are employed are genei’ally either port wine, or a solution of the sulphate of zinc of the strength of 5! to 5xij, or most commonly the tinctiu-e of iodine. If the port wine or a solution of the sulphate of zinc be em|)loyed, a sufficient quantity partly to distend the sac should be injected from an India-rubber bottle or brass syringe that can be adapted to the cannula ; six or eight ounces are commonly required for this purpose, and it should be allowed to remain in for some minutes before being evacuated. Injection of Iodine.—The injection of tincture of iodine, originally introduced by Sir J. R. Martin, whilst practising at Calcutta, is now commonly prefeiTed as a more certain and safer mode of treatment than any other. The quantity of tincture of iodine injected should vary from two dracluns to half an ounce, according to the size of the tumour. It may be used piue or diluted ■with an equal quantity of water. After injection, the Sm’geon should rub the scrotum gently over the testis, so as to diffuse the injection equally over the surface of the sac. One half the quantity thrown in should then be allowed to escape, the cannnla removed, and the puncture closed -ndth a piece of plaster. The cannula used for this purpose should be made of platinum and not of silver, which is apt to become corroded and made brittle by the action of the iodine. A good deal of inflammation, with fr’esh effusion into the sac, will usually be set up, on the subsidence of which, the cure ^vill be foimd to have been effected. Useful as the iodine injection is, it sometimes fails in producing a radical ciuc of hydrocele. This is attributable to two causes : the first is, that in some cases sufficient inflammation is not set np to induce that condition of the tunica vaginalis which is necessary for a radical cure. It is well knomi that, when a hydrocele fls radically cured by injection, it is so, not by any adhesion 1 taking place between the two opposite surfaces of the tunica vaginalis and a consequent obliteration of its cavity, but by the inflammation that is artiflcially induced exciting such a modification of this membrane as to restore the balance between the secretion and absorption of the fluid by which it is naturally lubricated. Now, in some cases, sufficient inflammation is not induced by the951 INJECTION OF IODINE. introduction of the irritating fluid to restore the two functions of the membrane ; and the tunica vaginalis gradually ^ after the injection, as it would after the simple operation of tapping, it occa- sionally hap}iens that the patient may suffer excruciating of the injection, from the contact of the stimulating fluid with the surface of the testis, and yet little or no inflammation may be excited. Ihe amount 0 suflering, therefore, at the time of the operation is by no moans proportionate to the amount of consecutive inflammation likely to be set up. indeed, tne reverse would appear to bo the case in many instances ; and I have often observed that, in those cases which progress most steadily to a radical cure, there is but a moderate amount of pain experienced at the time of the injection. ^ ^ ^ There is a second way in which injections would appear to fail; a consider- able amount of inflammation is excited, and effusion takes place into the tunica vaginalis, which in the course of three or four days becomes distended to the same size, or nearly so, that it had attained previously to the operation ; but this effused fluid, instead of being absorbed by the end of the second or third week, remains luichanged in bulk, or absorption goes on to a certain point, and then seems to be arrested ; the tmiica vaginalis remaining distended with a certain quantity of fluid. A third way in which the faihu'e arises, is in consequence of the walls of the sac being so thickened that they cannot collapse. The proportion of cases in which the iodine injection fails to bring about a radical cime of the hydrocele is variously estimated by different Surgeons. Thus Sir J. R. Martin states that in India the failui’es scarcely amoimt to 1 per cent.; Velpeau calculates them at 3 per cent. I am not aware that any statistics of this mode of treatment in this country have been collected ; but the general opinion of Surgeons would appear to be decidedly in its favour, as being the most successful as w'ell as the safest plan of treatment that has yet been introduced. In this opinion I fully coincide : yet it is by no means improbable that the success of the iodine injection in this country might not prove to be quite so great as is generally believed. I have seen a considerable number of cases of simple hydrocele of the tunica vaginalis, both in hospital and in private practice, in which a radical cure had not been effected, although recourse had been had to the iodine injection by some of the most careful and skilful Siu-geons of the day, as well as by myself. It is especially apt to fail in men advanced in years. In them there is either not sufficient inflammation excited, or if it be, the fluid that is as a consequence effused into the tunica vaginalis is not re-absorbed. One circumstance connected with the injection of tinctm’e of iodine into the tunica vaginalis deserves note. It is that, although in some cases it occasions but little pain, in other instances the suffering induced by it is of the most severe and agonising character—more so than follows the introduction of any other of the ordinary stimulants into the tunica vaginalis. Seton.—The cure by the introduction of a seton, though formerly much employed, is seldom practised at the present day, chiefly on account of the danger of exciting too much inflammation. It may, however, conveniently be employed in the true hydroceles of children, and in some of those cases in952 DISUASJilS OF THE TESTIS AND CORD. whicli the injection fails, if practised in tlie manner that will immediately be described. There can be no doubt that, as a hrst remedy, iodine injection is preferable to the seton, in the treatment of hydrocele ; but when the injection has failed, and this from no want of care on the part of the Surgeon, or of attention to the after-treatment of the case, but appaa-ently Irom insulficicnt inflammatory action having been set up in the tunica vaginalis to restore the lost balance between secretion and absorption in this membrane, the seton will, I think, be found to bo the most certain means of accomplishing our object. It is true that several objections may be urged to the use of the seton ; it requires much watching and care, and is occasionally apt to excite a dangerous amount of inflammation in the areolar tissue of the scrotum ; and these objections are, to my mind, sufflciently valid to prevent our employing it as the ordinary treatment for the radical cure of hydrocele. But it must be remembered, that the particular cases to which I am now alluding are those in which ordinary means have proved insuflicient to excite proper action, and in which, consequently, it would appear as if a greater amount of irritation could safely be borne. Indeed, nothing is more remarkable than the difference in the intensity of the inflammation that is set up in different individuals by the means that are commonly employed in the treatment of hydrocele. In some cases the most irritating injections may be thrown into the tunica vaginalis, or a seton may be drawn through the scrotum and left there for days, not only without giving rise to any injurious inflammation, but without setting up sufficient action to bring about a cure of the disease ; whilst in other instances simple tapping may effect a radical cure, or may gi^■e rise to such an amoimt of irritation as to terminate in a fatal sloughing of the scrotum. The seton that I employ in these cases is composed of one or two threads of dentist’s silk. It may be introduced by means of a nmvus needle, the fluid of the hydrocele being allowed to di’ain away through the punctiu’es thus made ; or, far better, by tapping the hydrocele, and then passing a needle about six inches long, armed ^nth the seton, iqD the camiula, drawing it thi’ough the upper part of the scrotum, and then removing the camiula, cutting off the needle, and knotting the thread loosely (Fig. 77, p. 153, Yol. I.). The thread should not be removed until the scrotum swells and becomes red, with some tenderness of the testis and effusion into the tunica vaginalis. YTien these effects have been produced, it may be cut and withdrawn, and the case treated in the same way as when the radical cure has been attempted by iodine injection; viz., by rest and antiphlogistic treatment. The length of time during which the seton must be left in before sufficient, or even any in- flammatory action is produced, varies very considerably. In most instances, the proper amount of inflammation is excited in from twenty-foim to thirty hoiu’S ; but in other cases the seton may be left in for ten or twelve days, giving rise to but little inflammation, although a radical cure may result. The Antiseptic Method has been successfully applied to the treatment of hydrocele by Yolkmann, and Reyhcr of Dorpat. The sac is incised along its anterior aspect, the fluid evacuated, and the parts dressed antiseptica j. This treatment is said to be more certain and less painful than that by in- jection. It would be especially useful in old cases with thickened walls m which the injection had failed.ENCYSTED IIYDltOGELE. 953 It is not always pracleiit to have recourse to the radical cure in the treat- ment of hydrocele. In persons advanced in years, or of feeble and unhealthy constitution, the inflammatory action excited in the tunica vaginalis by any of the means just detailed may run on to such an extent as togheiiseto inflammatory mdema, and e'S’on sloughing of the scrotum, with great danger to life. In men advanced in year’s it is much safer and usually sufficient to- temporise with the hydrocele, arrd only to tap as occasion arises from th& increasing size of the swelling. Excysted Hydrocele.—In this variety of the disease the fluid does not. lie in the tuirica vaginalis, but is contaiircd in a cyst which projects from the- surface of the ejrididynris or testis, and pushes the serous irrvestmerrt of th& gland before it. These cysts are much more frcqueirtly fouird corrnccted with the epididymis- than Avith the body of the testicle. Irrdeed, Oru’ling has pointed out the fact, that small pedrrncrdated cysts about the size of currarrts, arrd composed of a fine serous rnembrarre, liired with tesselated epithelium, are very frequently foiurd beneath the visceral tiurica vaginalis covering the epididymis. They are delicate iir strrrctrrre, corrtain a clear limpid fluid, arrd are very liable to- rirptm-e. They are met rvith at ah ages after that of puberty. According to Gosselin, after the age of forty, they occurred iir at least two thirds of tho testes examiired to ascertain their presence. Such cysts as these may remain stationary, of small size, and not to be detected durirrg life, being merely patho- logical phenomena ; they may ruptru’e into the tuirica vaginalis ; or they may enlarge and become developed into tumours of considerable magnitude. The fluid of these cysts possesses the remarkable characteristic discovered by Liston, of containing spermatozoa (Fig. 841); an observation that has been fuUy confirmed by many subsequent ob- servers. Though spermatozoa do not always exist in this fluid, yet they are usually met Avith, sometimes in smaU quantities, at others so abundantly as to give it a turbid or opales- cent appearance. This admixtine of sper- matozoa with the clear fluid of the cyst is probably due, as pointed out by Curling, to the accidental rupture of a seminal duct into an already existing cyst. Spermatozoa have also, but xery rarely, been found in the fluid of an ordinary hydrocele of the tunica vaginalis ; and then probably their presence Avas due to the rupture of one of these cysts into the tunica A’aginalis. Hence their presence in the fluid of hydrocele may in most cases be considered as charactei’istic of the encysted A^ariety of tho disease. There are tAvo distinct forms of encysted hydrocele ; in one the disease is due to dilatation of a seminal duct; in the other, to a ncAV cystic formatiorr. The first form alone contaiirs spermatozoa. ihe Si^ns of erreysted hydrocele difier in some respects from those presented by the ordinary form of the disease. Fig. S-ir.—Spermatozoa from Encysted riydiocele.DISEASES OF THE TESTIS AND CORD. 954 The tumour of the encysted variety is smaller, more irregular in shape, and does not envelop the testis completely, but is situated behind it, and rather in connection with the epididymis. Ihe Diagnosis from ordinary hydrocele of the tunica vaginalis may be made by observing : 1. That the testis is below and not covered in by the encysted form of the disease ; 2. That the tumour is more globular or irregular, and less pyriform ; 3. When tapped, the fluid will be found to be opalescent. The Treatmmt consists in injecting the sac with tincture of iodine, or in incising the tumour and allowing it to granulate from the bottom. The in- jection by iodine, though successful in some cases, is not so frequently so in this as in the last A’ariety of the disease, but usually deserves a trial; if it fail, the incision of the tumoim Avill always effect a cure. In encysted hydi’ocele, the iodine injection should not be so strong as that Avhich is used for injecting the tunica vaginalis. It shoidd be diluted with tAvo or three parts of Avater, as it comes more directly into relation Avith the structiu'e of the testis. Hyduocele oe the Coed.—This disease is characterised by the presence of a round or oval tumour, situated on the cord, below or Avithin the inguinal canal. It is smooth, elastic, and, if of sufficient size, may be semi- transparent on examination by transmitted light. It can be pushed up into the abdomen, but receives no impulse on coughing, and does not alter in size on being steadily compressed. It appears to be formed, in some cases, by the funicular portion of the peritoneal investment of the cord being im- . perfectly closed and consolidated at points ; though it is possible that in other instances it arises as a distinct cystic groAvtli. These tumours may occur at all ages, but are chiefly met Avith in the young, and are not unfrequent amongst children. The fluid of a hydi’ocele of the cord is lighter in colour than that of one of the tunica vagiualis. Treatment.—The obliteration of the cyst is best conducted by passing a seton through it, or by making an incision into it, treating it antiseptically, and letting it granulate from the bottom. Diffused Hydeocele of the Spbematic Coed consists in the infiltration of the cord A\dth serous fluid, contained in rather distinct cells, and giving rise to an oA’al or oblong irregular circumscribed tumoiu’, extending below and into the inguinal canal. The Treatment consists in the application of blisters, or of comiter-iiTitant iflasters. Should the disease prove very troublesome, an incision might be made doAA'n to and into the SAvelling, so as to let out the fluid and aUoAV the cyst to become consolidated. ILeaiatocele.—By Hcematocele is meant an acciunulation of blood in the tunica vaginalis, distending that sac, and compressing the testis. It is of two kinds, 'Traumatic and Spontaneous. The 'Traumatic is the most common form i of the disease, usually arising from a’ bloAV on or a squeeze of the testis, by Avhich one of the veins ramifying on the surface of the gland is ruptured, and blood is poured into the tunica v’aginalis.

It attains a larger size, and is altogether a more formid- able atleetion, than the traimiatic luomatocelc. Characlers.—In whatever way occurring, a haimatocele slowly but gradually increases in size until it attains about the magnitude ot a ducks egg, oi even that of a coeoa-nut. It is seldom that it becomes larger than this ; but cases are recorded in which the tumour has attained an enormous magnitude. 1 once operated in a case in which a spontaneous Innmatocele had existed for six yeai-s ; it was as large as a good-sized melon, and contained, besides about a quart of dark thin blood, a handful of partially decolorised and tough fibriiie, the greater portion of which was firmly adherent to the inside of the gTcatly thickened tunica vaginalis in filamentary and laminated masses, with here and there nodules interspersed. The whole of the interior of the tunica vaginalis closely resembled an aneurismal sac. The fluid contained in the ha3matocele, when the disease is recent, consists of pure blood. The blood so effused will continue fluid for years ; but at last it may decompose and set up fatal inflammatory mischief; in some rare instances the tumour becomes partly solidified by the deposit of masses of , fibrinous coagulum lining the interior of the tunica vaginalis, which are sometimes decolorised and arranged, as in the case just referred to, and in one recorded by Bowman, in a laminated manner, like the contents of an aneu- rismal sac. When the h^ematocele is of old standing, changes take place both in the effused blood and in the sac. The blood in old htematoceles becomes at first dark and treacly. As decomposition advances it becomes converted into a dirty-brownish fluid, full of shreds of partially decolorised fibrine and crystals of cholesterine. The tunica vaginalis becomes thickened and indiu-ated, and in extreme cases may midergo calcification. This change I found in a patient whose disorganised testis I removed for a htematocele of nearly forty years’ standing. Symjttoms.—These are generally sufficiently obvious. The occuiTence of the ' tumoiu- subsequently to a blow', strain, or injury when traumatic, its gradual increase in size, its somewhat heavy but semi-elastic feel, its pyriform shape, and the absence of transparency, together with the freedom of the cord above and the want of impulse in it on coughing, null indicate its true character. Diarjiiosis.—Ha3matocele of the tunica v'aginalis may be confomided with inguinal hernia : from which it may be distinguished by attention to the signs described at p, G(i(), Vol. II. It is perhaps more frequently confounded -with solid tumours of the testicle; and upon this fact is founded the excellent rule of practice never to remove a doubtful tumour of the testis without first ascertam- by an incision into its substance, that it is not a htematocele. Treatment.—This must v'ary -with the size and duration of the tumour. W hen it is small and recent, and has fluid contents, the Surgeon may try the effect of tapping it; it is possible that, after the evacuation of the blood, closure and obliteration of the tunica vaginalis will take place. This hap- pened in a case under my care, in which, though the disease had existed for three years, a complete cure follow'ed the operation of tapping. Such simple treatment as this, how-ever, cannot be depended upon ; and it usually becomes necessary to lay the sac open, treat the rvound antiseptically, and to cause itDISEASES OF THE TESTIS AND CORD. 95^ to contract and to granulate from the Ijottom, when the obliteration of the ca\ ity of the tunica vaginalis necessarily results. If the tumour Avere of veiy large size, and the tunica vaginalis much thickened, hardened, and parchment-like, with adherent and laminated fibrine, castration might possibly be rec|uircd. In the instance to Avhich I have already referred, and which is represented in Fig. 842, this was rendered necessary in con- secpience of these conditions, and Avas success- fully done. Haematocele of the Spermatic Cord has been obsei’A'ed by Pott, Curling, BoAvman, and others ; it is a rare disease, and usually occui’s in the form of tumour of considerable mag- nitude, suddenly arising after a strain or some to a rupture of a varicose spermatic A'ein. It canal, and thence extends doAvnwards along the Fig. 84-2.—Iliumatocjele vith Tliiok- , eiiecl Tuuica A'agiimlis and adlicieut Fibrinous Deposit. violent exertion, giving rise commences in the inguinal course of the cord, through the abdominal ring into the scrotum ; but it does not surround or implicate the testis, which can be felt free and movable at its loAvest part. On incising such a tumour as this, a quantity of blood, partly fluid and partly coagulated, has been found, sometimes contained in a cavity, occasioned by the laceration and separation of the tissues of the cord and scrotum. The most remarkable case of this kind on record is one related by BoAvman, in Avhich the tumour, after existing for ten years, had attained so enormous a size, that it reached to the patella, and was so heavy as to require both hands and a considerable effort to raise it from its bed. In this case, death appears to have resulted from decomposition of the contents of the tumour. Dic/f/nosis.—In its early stages, htematocele of the cord Avould run consider- able risk of being confounded Avith an inguinal hernia. The more diffused character of the swelling, however, its regular feel, its semi-fluctuating sen- sation, and the impossibility of reduction, might enable the diagnosis to be made (p. G59, Vol. II.). Hasmatocele of the cord may alAA'ays be distinguished from an acciunulation of Mood in the tunica vaginalis, by the testicle not being implicated in the former case, but surrounded by the fluid in the latter instance. The Treatment of this disease must in the earlier stages be of a palliative kind ; consisting in rest, support of the tumour, and the application of evapo- rating lotions. Care should be taken not to incise it at this period, lest the loss of blood from the ruptined vein, after the evacution of the contents of the tumom, become uncontrollable. In one instance I haA'e knoAvn fatal con- sequences from this cause to ensue in half an hour after making an incision into the tumour and turning out the coagula. When, hoAvever, the disease has reached a chronic stage, and is no longer increasing, it may be incised ; and, its contents being turned out, the cavity may be allowed to suppurate and granulate. VABICOOELE. Varix, or Enlargement of the Sjoermatic Veins, is a disease that is commonly957 DIAGNOSIS OF YAIUGOCELE. met with from the a«-G of puberty to about the thirtieth year, Bcldora com- mencing later than this. It usually occurs in feeble mdividuals having the scrotum lax and pendulous ; and in some cases appears to have been brought on by venereal excesses. 'J’he spermatic veins, extending as they do from opposite the lumbar vertebras to the plexus pampiniformis, which constitutes the base of the pyramidal tumour formed by a fully deA'eloped varicocele, arc necessarily subject to considerable outward pressure from the W'eight of so long a column of blood as that contained Avithin them, to Avhich they eventually yield, becoming much dilated and tortuous. The left spermatic veins arc far more fr-equcntly affected than the right; partly OAving to their compression by feculent accumulations in the sigmoid flexuie of the colon, and partly to the obstacle at the mouth, occasioned by their pouring their contents into the left renal vein, at right angles to the current of blood floAving through that vessel into the vena cava. dTe right spermatic veins are rarely affected ; and never, I bclieA-e, Avithout those on the left side participating in the disease. In these cases of double varicocele, the left is almost invariably the more seriously affected ; but I have seen exceptions to this in one or two instances, in which the A'cins on the right side formed the larger tumour. SvMrTOArs.—-The symptoms of A-aricocele consist of a tumour of pyramidal shape, having a knotted or knobbed feel, OAving to the irregularly swollen and convoluted condition of the veins, AAuth its base upon the testis and the apex stretching up to the external ring. The swelling increases Avhen the patient stands up, if he take a deep inspiration, cough, or make any violent exertion. Its size Am’ies from slight fulness of the veins to a large mass, several inches in circumference at the base. When the patient lies down, it goes up to a certain extent, but immediately returns to its former magnitude Avhen he stands up again. It is attended by a sensation of weight and sometimes of pain, Avhich is occasionally A'ery acute, of a severe and neuralgic character, even in the scrotum, the groins, and the loins, more particularly when the tumour is unsupported. This pain is greatly increased on the patient walking or riding ; so much so, that in some cases he is almost debaiTed fi-om taking- necessary exercise, and is prevented from following any active occupation. Debility of the generative organs, with a tendency to seminal emissions and much mental depression, frequently accompanies varicocele. The ruptiu-e of a varicocele may occur from external injury, giving rise to an enormous extravasation of blood into the areolar tissue of the scrotum. Of this Pott relates a case. In one, I have knoAvn this to be attended with fatal conse- quences. A man who, to use his OAvn expression, “ had been romping Avith his wife,” received a bloAV on a varicocele, aa'Iicu an enormous extravasation of blood rapidly formed in the scrotum and the cord, for Avhich he Avas admitted into the Hospital. The tumour Avas incised, and, large masses of coagula haAdng been turned out, the patient, in the absence of assistance, suddenly became faint and died of venous hemorrhage. The bleeding Avas found to have proceeded fr-om a ruptured spermatic vein. Diagnosis.—The diagnosis of varicocele is always sufficiently easy ; its peculiar feel, its broad base and narrow apex, the manner in Avhich it goe.s up . when the patient lies down, and returns again when he stands up, are sufficient to distinguish it fr-om all other scrotal tumours. From inguinal hernia the958 DISEASES OF THE TESTIS AND CORD. disease may be distinguished by attention to the test described at p GOO Vol. II. TuEATJtENT.—The treatment of vai-icocelc must be conducted with reference to the severity of the symptoms occasioned by it, and to the extent of -the disease. When, as is usually the case, it gives rise to but slight inconvenience, palliative treatment is fully sufficient; but il"; as occasionally happens, the disease be a source of very intense suffering, or tend to the induction of atrophy of the testis, or to generative debility, with much mental disquietude or hypochondriasis, then the Surgeon may feel disposed to cndeavoiu- to cure the varicocele radically. The FalliaUve Trealment of varicocele resolves itself into means of various kinds, having for their object the support of the testis and the diminution of the length, and of the consequent pressure, of the column of blood. This is usually most conveniently done by supporting the scrotum in a well-made suspensory bandage ; or pressure may be made upon the part, as well as support given, by enclosing the testis in an elastic bag. In other cases, support may be afforded by drawing the lower portion of the scrotum on the affected side through a ring made of soft metal, covered with leather, or better still, through a small vulcanised India-imbber ring, so as to shorten the cord. And, with the same object, excision of the lower portion of the scrotum has been recommended; so that, by the contraction of the cicatrix, the testis may be pressed up against the ring, and the cord thus shortened. This plan, however, is somewhat severe ; and though it might be attended by temporaiy benefit, the advantage accruing is not likely to be very continuous. The pressure of the pad of a truss on the spermatic cord, as it issues from the external ring, Avill break the length of the column of blood in its veins, and may thus be of service in some cases, though many patients cannot bear the irksome pressure of the instrument. In addition to these mechanical means, the part may be braced by cold douching, sea-bathing, and the general strength improved by the administra- tion of iron. The Radical Cure of Varicocele consists in the obliteration of the enlarged veins by compressing and exciting inflannuation in them, on the same principle that guides us in the management of A'arix in other situations. The circumstances for which operation may be and has been practised in this disease can be arranged in the following categories. 1. "WTien the existence of a varicocele disqualifies the sufferer from admission into the public services, there is, in my opinion, a perfectly legitimate reason for operating. One of the cases in Avhich I have effected a radical cure was that of a man in the prime of life, who, wishing to enlist in the Marines, was refused solely on the ground of having a small varicocele. This I cured by oiicration, and the man afterwards entered the sel^ ice. ^ ^ 2. In some cases, the presence of a varicocele of inordinate size causes a distressing sense of weight and pain in the loins and groins, and often inability to "stand or walk for any length of time. Here, when the patient is in continual discomfort, or more or less prevented from pursinng his ordiiiaiy avocations—in fact, quite crippled—it is perfectly justifiable to lesort to operation.ilujtcal cunE of yakigocele. 959 3. 'When atrophy of the testicle is a consequence of the pressure of the blood in the veins, an operation may be performed. 4. Cases not uncommonly occur where the pressure of the enlaiged ^eius on the speimatic nerves produces repeated attacks of spermatonhoea. dhese cases arc, however, more frequently met with out of hospitals, than in individuals of the class who apply to such institutions for relief. In fact, young rnen of the more highly educated classes are very subject to varicocele, especially those who habitually lead a sedentary and studious life, as, for instance, young elcrgjnnen and lawyers. In these persons, a peculiarly hypochondriacal state is brought on by the tendency of the mind to dwell on the condition of the genital organs, and the patient is constantly fidgeting about the local and tangible disease he observes in them. liow should the radical cure of this condition be produced ? To this I would answer—By exciting adhesive inflammation of the spermatic veins, through an application of the same principle which sets up that process in the veins of the lower extremity. There are several different ways of doing this ; ^ome are very objectionable. The twisted suture, as applied to the veins of the leg, induces too great imtation in the scrotum, and there its introduction is often followed by violent inflammation or sloughing, or by an opening up of Fi^'. 843.—non Pin for Treatment of Varicocele. the areolar tissue of the scrotum with oedema, and even purulent infiltration. It is better, I think, not to use this method here ; indeed I have twice, in the Fig. 844.—Needle threaded 'with Silver Wire. practice of others, seen it followed by death. The plan I have adopted for some years is that suggested and practised by Yidal de Cassis, and is as follows. The vas deferens, readily dis- tinguished by its round cord-like feel, is first separated from the veins, and entrusted to an as- sistant ; next, an iron pin bored with a hole at each end (Fig. «43), is passed between the vas and the veins, and brought out at the point of perforation, the scrotum being first notched with a scalpel; then a silver wire, threaded on a needle so con- structed that the wire shall Fig. s«.-vifiui’s Operation it without catching (Fig. and Fig. 84G.—Wire Twisted and Veins Rolled ui). follow H44), is passed in at the aper- ture of entry of the pin, and carried between the integument of the scrotum and960 DISEASES OF THE TESTIS AND COllD. the Tcins, the -wire being- brought out at the second puncture (Fig. 845). Eacli end of the wire is now passed througli the corresponding hole of the pin, which is twisted round and round repeatedly, each turn causing the wire to be rolled around the pin, and so tightened, till the veins are firmly compressed between the pin behind and the loop of wire in front (Pig. 84fi). By this means the scrotum is quite free and uncompressed, and there is no dano-er of exciting inflammation or oedema. The wire should be tightened from day to day, as it causes ulceration in the veins until it has completely cut throuo-h, which lesults, usually, in about a w'cclc or ten days. Meanwhile, there is much plastic matter throwm out around the veins ; this finally contracts and obliteiates their channels. This method produces an effectual and permanent cure (Fig. 847). Pig. 847.—Vidul’s Operation : Appearance of Xeedle and Wire when removed. Of late, I have been in the habit of employing a simpler method. I separate. the vas deferens in the usual way, and then make a small incision, about half an inch long, in the fr-ont and back of the scrotum: afterwards I pass a needle armed with silver wire, as before described, between the vas and the veins, bringing it out behind; I then return the needle, but this time can-ying it in front, between the veins and the skin ; and thus the veins are included in a loop of Avire, without impheating the scrotum. The loop is then tightly twisted together, so as to constrict the enclosed vessels. This plan has a similar effect to that of the Avire and pin combined ; by repeated tightenings the Avire gradually effects a passage by ulceration through the veins, which are obliterated by the same process. It has been objected to this and similar operations, that atrophy of the testis may take place, from its arterial branches being included together Avith the veins ; but, as the spermatic artery runs near to the vas deferens, and is held out of the way with that duct, it escapes, and the chance of that mischief is avoided. Nevertheless, atrophy of the testis may coexist, as the result of long- continued pressure of the blood in the vessels of the gland before the perform- ance of the operation. TUMOURS OP THE TESTIS. All solid tumours of the testicle are classed together imder the generic term •of Sarcocele ; and, when these are conjoined with fiuid accumulations in the timica A'aginalis, they are termed Hydro-sarcocele. Sarcocele is usually divided into the Simple, the SyphiUUc, the Tuhermlous, the Cystic, and the Maliynant; w^hich, indeed, comprise so many distinct diseases of the testis, requiring separate study. SiJiPLE Sarcocele is a chronic enlargement of the testis resulting fr-om 1 inflammatory mischief in the organ, not arising from syphilis or deposit of tubercle. It is, in fact, chronic orchitis. Both the epididymis and the body of the gland are usually affected. The testicle feels hard, smooth, solid, though perhaps slightly elastic at points ; it is ovoid in shape, and usually about as large as a duck’s egg. It is heaA'y and but slightly painful, and.961 rATlIOLOGY OF CHRONIC ORCHITIS. except in very old cases, the peculiar sensation felt on squeezing a testicle is present. The cord is usually somewhat thickened, and, as well as the groin, is the seat of pain of a dragging character. The tunica vaginalis occasionally contains serous fluid lying in front of and obscuring the testis, constituting the condition spoken of as hydro-sarcocele. The scrotum is always healthy, and one testicle only is usually affected. Occasionally simple chronic inflam- mation may slowly gi^'C rise to suppuration, and one or more abscesses may form, especially in strumous subjects. In these circumstances, a part of the indurated testicle softens and becomes prominent, the skin becomes rod, shining and thinned, and adhesions form between it and the gland beneath. At last the abscess bursts and a flstulous opening is left. Through this aperture a fungus (hernia testis, or benign fungus of the testicle) speedily protrudes, which grows sometimes slowly, sometimes rapidly, perhaps attaining a very considerable size (Tig. 848). As the fungus in- creases, the organ appears to atrophy, but in reality is drawn out of the scrotum and merges into the fungus. This fungus is not a ne\v gr’owth, but is a granular mass composed essen- tially of the tubuli testis and inflammatory pro- ducts. It is in the form of a pale reddish-yeUow granular mass. If small and firm, it may become a very chronic complaint; but if large, rapidly growing, and loose-textured, it speedily destroys the secreting structiu’e of the testis, leaving- nothing in the scrotum but a thickened epididymis and a contracted and shrunken tunica albuginea. It is, however, surprising how long the functions of this organ will continue, though its tissue is in a great measure destroyed, and its structiue traversed by suppurating fistulte. Occasionally, instead of bursting and giving rise to fungus, the abscess may become sun-ounded by dense fibroid tissue and remain stationary, and this dense waU has been known to calcify. Simple chronic orchitis can usually be distinctly attributed to a blow, squeeze, or other injury by which inflammation has been excited in the Fig. S4S.—Hernia Testis or Benign Fungus of the Testicle. organ. Stn(cturp.—(h\ making a section of a testicle affected with simple chronic inflammation, the tunica vaginalis will be found to be more or less adherent, and perhaps separated from the tunica albuginea in parts by small col- lections ot fluid. The tunica albuginea is thickened, often presenting on its external surface a series of firm, glistening layers. The septa of the testis are seen to be thickened, rendering the whole organ hard and firm, and givino- It a bluish-gi-ey appearance. In the midst of this, soft opaque yellow spots may be seen. These have been mistaken for tubercle, but arc in reality masses of chronic inflammatory products that have undergone fatty degenera- tion. Ihe microscope shows that the chronic inflammation chiefly affects the mtertubular fibrous tissue, but in many cases this is accompanied by catarrhal overgrowth of the epithelium. ^ VOL. II. Q9^2 DISEASES OF THE TESTIS AND CORD. Profjnosis.—Simple chronic orchitis usually terminates in recovery, but the organ may lie left somewhat enlarged and indurated, or in other cases it may undergo atrophy as the inflammatory products become absorbed. Strapping and the administration of an alterative course of bichloride of mercury may be tried. If the organ do not diminish in size by these means, or if it be a soux’ce of much inconvenience to the patient, it must lie removed. If accompanied by hydrocele the hydrocele must be tapped, but on no account should injection of iodine be resorted to. If abscesses form, they must be opened. AVhen a fungus has protruded through one of the fistulous apertiu’es, means must be taken to repress or remove this, lest it go on to complete destruction of the testis. If it be of small size, the best plaxi will be to sprinkle it with red oxide of mercury, and to strap it tightly down with a piece of lint and strapping. If it be larger, it may be shaA'ed off, and the cut surface then dressed with the ointment of the red oxide of mercury ; care being taken during cicatrisation to repress the granu- lations below the level of the surrounding integument by strappmg and pressm’e. Syme has recommended that the pressiu'e should be effected by the integument of the part; an elhptical incision being made round the fungus and the edges of the opening in the skin through which it protrudes pared away, the scrotal integuments are freely separated by dissection from their subjacent connexions, and brought together over the protruding mass and secm’ed by sutures. This operation I haA'e practised with success. Should the fungus be of A-ery large size, so as to include Avithin itself the whole or greater part of the structure of the testis, it may not be possible to save any of that organ ; and in these circumstances it is better to remove the AA'hole gland ; if left it could ncA^er be of any sendee, and Avould continue slowly to suppm-ate. Tubercular Testicle, Scrofulous Testicle, or Tubercular S.\r- COCELE.—This disease, although occasionally met Avith in individuals appa- rently strong and healthy, usually occurs in those of a feeble or cachectic constitution, most frequently in early manhood; and, although commonly associated Avith phthisis, may occur AAdthout any evidence of tubercularisation in other organs. It is very common to find both glands affected, but the disease is usually more advanced in one than in the other. In some cases it arises apparently as a sequence of gonorrhoeal epididymitis, or there may be a history of some injury to the testicle. The disease almost invariably commences in the epididymis, either at the globus major or minor, AA^hich becomes swollen, indurated, and shghtly tender. As it progresses, it spreads upwards along the vas deferens until it may reach the prostate and A^esiculie seminales, and forwards through the corpus High- morianum into the body of the testis. In some rare cases, it is said to commence in the body of the gland. The progress of the disease is usually sloAV, but it may go on rapidly to almost complete destruction of the testis. In a well marked case the foUoAving conditions Avill be found. ^ The testicle is moderately enlarged, but on examination this enhu’gement aa ill be found to be chiefly in the epididymis, Avhich can be felt as an irregular, craggy, nodulated mass, half surrounding the body of the gland in the form of a crescent situated at its posterior aspect. In the hard mass, Avhich often con- siderably exceeds the body of the gland in bulk, spots of softening may be963 STRUCTURE OF TUBERCULAR TESTICI^E. felt. The gland itself may rr Fig. S40.—Tubercular Testi- cle, showing the diseased E])i- tlidyiiiis forming a crescentic mass partially suiTounding tlie healthv body. iu«j feel soft and natimal, or a nodule or tiyo may be felt in its substance.

If the disease have extended to the vesiciihx! semin.ales, these can be felt enlarged and hardened by introducing the finger into the rectum. There is little or no pain, and on squeezing the gland the ordinary sensations will be perceived by the patient except in a very advanced stage of the disease. As the disease advances, one of the craggy nodules^ softens, and the skin becomes adherent over it. This process is accompanied by more acute inflammation, usually caus- ing marked increase of pain and tenderness. The adherent skin becomes red and shining, and finally gives way, and the tuberculous abscess dischaiges it- self, leaving an unhealthy cavity yielding thin pus mixed with soft, shreddy whitish-yellow sloughs. In some favourable cases the cavity may granulate and close completely, or leave merely a fistulous opening discharging small quantities of serous fluid. In most cases, however, the process of softening extends, other nodules break down, and a great part of the testicle may be destroyed. If an abscess should form in the body of the gland, a hernia or fungus testis may follow, as in simple chronic orchitis. Occasionally exuberant granulations may sprout out ’from the region of the epididymis, closely resembling the true fungus testis. The general health suffers greatly, and at a comparatively early stage of the case tubercular disease of the lungs is almost' certain to make its appearance. In the great majority of cases, the opposite testicle also becomes affected. Death usually results from the disease of the lungs, but it may occur fr’om acute general tuberculosis with tubercular meningitis. Occasionally the disease may extend to the urinary tract, and terminate fatally from tubercular disease of the kidneys. In some cases of phthisis,in which the testicles enlarge, and yet give but little trouble, the whole organ, both body and epididymis, may be found converted into a uniform soft cheesy mass. A specimen of two such testicles, fi'om a patient who died fi-om disease of the Imigs, is in the Museum of University College. In cases of acute general tuberculosis, grey granulations have been found in the testicles. Slructure—Qi{ making a section from before backwards through a typical specimen of tubercular disease of the testicle, the following conditions will be found. The tunica vaginalis may be perfectly healthy, or may be here and there adherent to the tunica albuginea. The tunica albuginea will be normal in appearance, except in the immediate neighbourhood of a tubercular gTOwth, where it will be thickened. That part of the body of the gland nearest the surface may be perfectly healthy in appearance ; there is no thickening of the septa, and the tubules can be teased out under water as in a healthy testicle. As Ave approach the corpus Highmorianum, the gland964 DISEASES OF THE TESTIS AND CORD. becomes studded with small hard nodides, not growing in the septa, but in the glandular substance of the testis. In their earliest stage these are merely hard semi-transparent granulations ; but they soon show signs of undergoing fatty degeneration in the centre, so that the majority have the appearance of small bodies about the size of a millet-seed, having a yellow opaque centre, and a delicate greyish semi-transparent gi’owing margin. Still nearer the coi-pus Highmoriannm these yellow spots coalesce, and fomi a solid cheesy substance, continuous with a still larger mass of the same kind, which represents the epididymis, and half surrounds the body of the gland in the shape of a crescent. In this larger mass patches of softening are found fomiing the tubercular abscesses above described, and these may extend into the body of the gland. On making transverse sections of the vas deferens, its walls will be seen to be thickened, and its centre filled up with a yellow cheesy material. If the disease be fhrther advanced, the whole gland may be converted into a single cheesy mass, in which softening may be taking place at various parts. The exact natime of the change that tabes place in the production of the condition above described, has given rise to much difference of opinion ; some authors maintaining that the primary change consists in an overgTowth of the epithelium of the tubuli seminiferi and epididymis, which afterwards undergoes fatty degeneration ; and others asserting that the primary growth takes place between the tubuli, and that the changes in the epithelium are secondary. The accompanying drawing (Fig. 850) represents a section of one of the Fig. S50.—Tubercular Testis. «. Tubuli seminiferi; h. Giant-cells (40 diaiu.). small outlying nodules in the body of the gland, as described above. It will be seen that the change chiefly consists in an accimiulation of small rouncl cells in a more or less perfect reticulate stroma between the tubules, sepa- rating them from each other. At the same time the walls of the tubules lun-e undergone a change, being infiltrated with cells in the same way as the sin-SYPJIILITIC ORCHITIS. 965 rounding parts. The tubules also are choked with epithelium, wliich in sonic parts of the same testicle was found to bo undergoing flitty degeneration. Towai’ds the centre of the nodule the intcrtubular growth also becomes caseous. Scattered through the now growth are many large masses of proto- plasm containing inany nuclei, the so-called giant-cells. Those are not con- stantly present in cases of tubercular testis. It is most probable, theiefore, that the change commences in the lymphatic tissue in the walls of the ducts of the epididjTuis and between the tubuli seminiferi, and gh’es rise to secondary proliferation of the epithelium ; both the intortubular gTOwth and the proliferated epithelium afterwards undergoing fatty degeneration, and forming cheesy masses. Frof/nosis.—The prognosis of tubercular disease of the testis is extremely bad. Treatment is of little if any avail, and the patient almost in^■ariably dies sooner or later of disease of the lungs, from general acute tuberculosis, or ft’om extension of the disease to the bladder, prostate, and even, in rare cases, the kidneys. In some cases, however, after the abscesses have burst, the cavities may heal, and the testicle remain Avithered, but free from active disease. 'Treatment.—The treatment of tubercular testis must be conducted on general principles ; alteratives, tonics, especially the iodide of iron, Avith cod- liver oil, and general hygienic means calculated to improve the health, must be steadily persevered in for some length of time. Local applications are of little avail. The abscesses must be opened when they form, and some simple dressing applied. If fungus form, it is of little use to try to treat it by the methods before described, as if the body of the testis be deeply infiltrated Avith tubercle, no good could result. If the gland gi\'e much trouble to the patient, and if there be at the same time no very marked constitutional affection, and the lungs be not in a state of very actiA'e disease, the operation of castration is j)erfectly justifiable ; although in most cases it is at best only calculated to giA'e the patient temporary relief, as the disease usually extends along the vas deferens beyond the reach of the knife, and will continue to progress in the vesicul® seminales and prostate, unless the patient succumb early from disease of the lungs. Syphilitic Orchitis, Syphilitic Sarcocele.—Syphilitic disease of the testicle appears under tAvo forms, a simple inflammatory and a gummatous. I he latter has frequently been confounded Avith tubercle, under the name of tuberculo-syphilitic sarcocele. The error arose before the exact nature of the syphilitic gumma AAns understood. Syphilitic orchitis of both forms may occur either as the result of inherited syphilis in infants or of acquired syphilis in adults. It is usually one of the later manifestations of the disease. The Simple Inflammatory Form, which has been accurately described by VirchoAv, consists essentially of a chronic inflammation of the connectiA'e tissue between the tubuli seminiferi. The disease may uniformly aftcct the AA'hole gland or be limited to localised patches. If the AA'hole gland be affected, the organ sloAvly enlarges to perhaps more than double its natural size. The enlargement will be found to affect the body of the gland, the epididymis undergoing but little if any change ; in fact, it may be to a great extent con-966 DISEASES OF THE TESTIS AND CORD. ccalcd by the thickening round it so as to )jc scarcely recognisable. 'I'lic cord and vas deferens are unaffected. The body of the gland feels hard, almost cartilaginous, and the surface is smooth or i^erhaps slightly irregular. There is no pain, except a di-agging sensation in the groin due to the increased weight of the testicle. There is little or no tenderness, and in the more advanced stages the peculiar sensation caused by scpieczing a healthy testicle is absent. There is no tendency to softening or to the formation of abscess. The disease is almost always accompanied by hydrocele, but at the same time adhesions luiiy exist at various parts between the tunica albuginea and the tunica vagi- nalis, dividing the fluid into two or more portions, or limiting it to a small part of the surface of the testicle. Most commouly only one testicle is affected, but both may be attacked. In the localised form the induratiou is limited to one or more portions of the gland, the remainder being soft and healthy. Structure.—On making a section from before backwards, the following appearances are found. If hydrocele exist, the tunica vaginalis will be opacpie and thickened, and probably adherent at various points to the surface of the testicle. If no hydrocele be present, the tunica vaginalis may be uniformly adherent. The tunica albuginea will always be found greatly and irregularly thickened, and from it proceed opaque white dense fibroid processes into the substance of the gland. These may in extreme cases be so abundant that no healthy gland-substance can be seen between them ; in less severe cases, patches of healthy tubular substance are found at various parts of the organ. A process of cicatricial contraction taking place in these fibroid processes may lead to a dimpling of the smface of the organ. The microscope shows that the change is due to an infiammatory small round-celled growth, which afterwards undergoes a development into a dense fibroid tissue, situated in the connective tissue between the tubuli seminiferi. The new growth separates, and presses on the tubules, and may lead to their destruction in large areas, as the result of the pressure. The gummatous form is an aggravation of that just described, and presents the same symptoms, "with the addition of those caused by the presence of the gummata. These fonn hard craggy no- dules on the surface of the gland, the irregulail- ties so produced being £ much greater than those arising from simple fibroid induration. The o-ummata have little ten- O deucy to soften, and dis- charge externally; yet in rare cases they may do so. ^ Structure.—On making a section of a gland in this condition, more or less ot the fibroid induration, above described, will always be found combined with thicken- ino- of the tunics of the testicle. The gummata vary in size, from a spht-pea to a S51.—Syiiliilitic Gunmiata of the Testis, a, h. Guiuiiiata lait across; c. Section of Globus minor and Cord.967 niAGNOSIS OF SAFGOCELES. hazel-nut. They are of an opaque yellow colour, irregular in shape and of dense leatheiy hardness. They may he tolerably shai-ply circumscribed to the naked eye, biit are usually suiTOunded by a zone of fibrous induration of an opaque white colour. The microscope shows around them the ^me sma - celled growth above described, situated between the tubules. iSearei the centre the tubules are found to be pressed upon and destroyed, and the cells of the new gi-owth commence to undergo degeneration ; until, in the yellow part of the gumma, nothing but granular ilehris are to bo recogmised. ibe Fig. S52.—Syphilitic Testis, o. Tubuli Seininiferi; h. A part of the round-celled growth heginiiiiig to undergo fatty degeneration (ISO diam,). gummata may be distinguished from tubercle by their greater toughness and more opaque yellow colour. Tubercle is rarely limited to the body of the testes ; gummata, on the other hand, rarely affect the epididymis. Prognosis.—If the disease be recognised and treated early, complete recovery may be confidently hoped for ; although relapses are of frequent occurrence. In the more advanced stages, the prognosis is not so hopeful, as, although under proper treatment the new growth may be absorbed, the gland will re- main shrunken, puckered, and indurated. This is but what would be expected; as the tubuli seminiferi, as above stated, become more or less extensively destroyed by the pressure of the new growth in the later stages of the disease. The Treatment is that laid down in Chapter XXXVI. for constitutional syphilis. Locally, the hydrocele may be tapped (but on no account injected), and pressure may be applied, by strapping over some mercurial ointment. Diagnosis of the Simple, Tubercular, and Syphilitic Sarcoceles.—The diagnosis of these affections is in some cases easy, in others very difficult. What- ever the form of disease may be, if it be complicated by hydrocele, this must first be tapped in order that the gland may be accurately examined. The hydrocele in these cases may not be translucent, as the tunica vaginalis is often thickened. It must be remembered that hydrocele is a very rare complication of cancer, or of cystic sarcoma; it is rare with tubercular sarcoccle ; less I'are with simifie chronic orchitis, and very common with syphilitic disease. From hmmatocele and tumours, the diagnosis may be made by attention to the rules laid doAvn on p. 974. It having been determined that the swelling is due to one of the968 DISEASES OF THE TESTIS AND CORD. tlireo above-mentioned causes, it remains to aseertain wliich it is. This may be done by attention to the following points. Tlie cord is often thickened and tender in simple chronic orchitis ; in tubercular sarcocole, the vas deferens alone IS affected, being frequently considerably enlarged ; in syphilis, the cord is perfectly healthy. In simple chronic orchitis, the epididymis may be swollen, but the chief enlargement is in the body; in tubercular disease, the epididymis is almost always the starting point of the disease, and is enlarged more than the body ; in syphilitic sarcocele, the body is first and almost exclusively affected. In chronic orchitis, the enlargement is usually uniform and smooth, and fluctuation is rarely present; in tubercular sarcocele, the enlarged epididymis is craggy and nodular, and spots of softening may be felt; in syphilitic sarco- cele, the body of the gland is greatly indurated, often nodulated, and soften- ing is very rare. The testicle is usually painful and tender in chronic orchitis ; in tubercular sarcocele it is sometimes tender, seldom painful; in syphilitic disease, it is almost invariably jDerfectly painless, and free from tenderness. The constitutional condition of the patient should also be care- fully inquired into. Chronic orchitis usually arises as a sequence of injury, or perhaps gonorrhoea, in patients possibly strumous, gouty, or rheumatic ; tubercular disease occurs almost always in cachectic subjects, with a tuber- cular history and a tendency to phthisis. The lungs should therefore be carefully examined. In syphilitic sarcocele, the ordinary symptoms of consti- tutional syphihs may be present, or a syphilitic history may be obtained. In tubercular sarcocele, the vesiculte seminales may be felt to be enlarged through the rectum. Cystic Disease of the Testis, or, Cystic Sarcoma of the Testis, or Cystic Sarcocele.—In this disease the testis becomes enlarged, indimated, of a yellowish-white and opaque appearance, and studded with a multitude of cysts, that vary in size from a pin’s head to a cherry, containing clear amber- coloured or brownish fluid (Fig. 853). The disease may run a simple or a malignant coiu'se. The enlarged testicle may reach a very great size, without showing any signs of general malignancy. In the simpler forms, the disease somewfoat resembles the adeno-sarcoma of the mamma. The new' grow'th is fomid to be composed of a stroma, consisting of various modifications of coii- necti-^n tissue in all stages of growdh, in the midst of which are spaces lined with epithelium. The stroma shows great irregularity of structure. In the same specimen may be found fibroid tissue, cartilage, myxoma- tissue, spindle-celled and round-celled sarcoma-tissue. Paget has found the cartilage to be arranged in beaded branching lines, resembling the course and shape of the lymphatic vessels, and has showm that it actually lies within them. The epithelial spaces arc irregulai- in shape and size. It is difficult to say wdiether they represent the remains of tubuli seminiferi or not. The cysts arc formed by dilatation of these spaces, and are lined by a squarish epithelium. Intracystic growths may be found, as in the mamma, projecting Fig. 85S.—C.ystio Sni'coiua of tlie Testicle.969 MALIGNANT SARCOCELE. into the cysts. The disease may assume a malignant form, either 1^7 P^’O' pagating itself in the internal organs like a sarcoma ; or, according to l^m - assuming ileFsch, actual cancerous transformation may take place, the stroma the form of a cancer-stroma, and the epithelium of the spaces assuming t e actiA-e growth of the cells of a true carcinoma. According to burling, cystic disease of the testicle is the result of morbid changes in the ducts of tlie rote testis* Z»%7?os/s.—This affection has been carefully studied by Sir A. Cooper ; who, with great justice, adverts to the difficulty of distinguishing it from other diseases of this organ, more especially from hydroccU. The imints to be especially attended to in distinguishing the cystic sarcocele, arc its want of translucency, the more globular shape of the organ, its weight, and the enlarged and varicose state of the veins of the cord. If there be any doubt, an exploia- tory puncture will resolve this, and should always be pi’actiscd. Treatment.—Cystic sarcocele requires remo^'al of the diseased organ. Cysts containing Coloured Matters.—Occasionally, cystic tumours of the testicle are met with, in which the substance of the organ is atrophied or absorbed, and its place occupied by one or more large thin-walled sacculi con- taining fluids of different colours and consistence, dark or fatty. One of the most remarkable of these anomalous tumours of the testis that I have seen u as imder the care of my colleague ilarshall, at the hospital. The diseased organ, which was about the size of an ostrich’s egg, and felt partly solid and partly fluid, was found after remoi'al to be composed of a large cyst filled with an oily fluid, like melted butter, which solidified on cooling. After removal jMarshall found that the sac contained some foetal deh'is, and was doubtless of an embryonic character. The patient, who was about thirty years of age, liad been affected with the tumour from early infancy. Enchondroiiia of the Testicle.—Cartilage, as before stated, is almost always present in the cystic sarcoma of the testis. It may, however, appear alone, deposited in larger or smaller nodules, or infiltrating the gland. It usually commences in the body, but may invade the epididymis ; but, according to Cornil and Eanvier, whenever it reaches any considerable size it is no longer purely cartilaginous, but is mixed with sarcoma-tissue and complicated with cysts, so that both clinically and pathologically it merges into the disease just described as cystic sarcoma. jMaligxaxt Sarcocele, or Caj^cer op the Testicle, not unfrequently occurs, and almost imuriably assumes the encephaloid character. It is indeed a question whether any other form of cancer ever occurs in the testicle. Walshe agrees with most observers in doubting the existence of the other varieties of malignant disease in this organ. Characters.—Cancer of the testicle most commonly occiu’S in the first instance in the liody of that organ, rarely affecting the epididymis primarily. The ordinary characters of encephaloid are always well marked in this affection ; and the tumour eventually becomes softened dowi, pulpy, and fungous. Inter- mixed with the encephaloid are commonly foiuid masses of a bright-yellow colour, which have sometimes been regarded as tuberculous, but, I believe, erroneously so ; for, in those instances in which I have had an opportunity of examining them, I have found them to consist, as in the simple sarcocele, of970 DISEASES OF THE TESTIS AND OOIU). plastic matter that was midorgoing latty degeneration. A malignant testicle may rapidly attain a very considerable magnitude, becoming as larc/e as a cocoa-nut m a few weeks or months. When of this size it is, of course, abundantly supplied by blood-vessels ; consequently the spermatic artery and accompanying veins will be found a good deal dilated. The lymphatic glands in the neighbourhood speedily become enlarged, those in the iliac fossa espe- cially, as may be ascertained by deep pressure in the flank. The inguinal glands do not in general become affected, until the skin has become implicated by the progress of the disease. It is then also that the caneerous cachexy rapidly develops itself. ihe Symptoms of encephaloid of the testicle are usually somendiat obseure in the early stages, although they become clearly and distinctly developed as the disease progresses. The patient first begins to complain of some degi’ee of chagging pain and weight in one of the testes, which on examination will be found to be indurated and eidarged, though preserving its normal shape. The enlargement continues until the testicle attains about the size and shape of a duck s egg, being somewhat tense and elastic, but smooth and heavy. As it increases in size, which it usually does with rapidity, it becomes rounded and somewhat doughy or puljiy in feel in parts, Avhere, indeed, it may almost be semi-fiuctuating. though in others it continues hard and knobbed. This altera- tion in feel is partly due to softening of the substance of the. tumour, and partly to its making its way through the tunica albuginea. The scrotimr is much distended, reddened, and purplish, and becomes covered by a network of tortuous veins ; the cord may become somewhat enlarged, hard, and knotty. As the disease advances, the scrotum becomes adherent at some of the softened parts, ulceration takes place, and a fungus projects, which presents all the characteristic signs of fimgus hmmatodes ; it does not commonly happen, how- ever, that the disease is allowed to go so far as this before removal. The pain is not very severe at first, but after a time assiunes a lancinating character, extending up the eord and into the loins. Secondary infection of the system takes place through the medium of the lumbar glands in which the absorbents of the testis terminate. In cancer of the scrotum, just as in the same disease of the jDenis, the inguinal glands become secondarily affected. Treatment.—The only treatment of any avail in encephaloid of the testicle, is the removal of the diseased organ. This operation is not performed so much with the view of curing the patient of his disease, which will probably return in the iliac glands or in some internal organ, as of affording temporary relief from the suffering and incumbrance of the enlarged testicle. It is therefore an operation of expediency, and should only be done in those cases in which the disease is limited to the testicle, the cord being free and the lumbar glands not involved; so that, if recm-rence take place, it may not be a very speedy one. An Undescended Testis may become the seat of structiual disease, just as it may be affected by infiammation. The combination of malposition ol the organ and structiual disease is necessarily rare. But its possible occiu- rcnce must be borne in mind by the Surgeon, as it may lead to the necessity of an operation for the removal of the diseased mass from the inguinal canal. Cases of this kind are recorded by Storks and J. M. Arnott. The tumour in the first case was as large as a cocoa-nut; in the second as a man’s fist. BothDIVISION OF THE CORD IN CASTRATION. 97* were medullary. The operation consists in exposing the tumour by a free ineision—if necessary, carried through the tendon of the external oblique opening the tuniea vaginalis, enucleating the mass, and tying with care the shortened spermatic cord, Avhich Avould probably be the most difficult part of the operation. The possible co-existence of a congenital hernia must be remembered. But it is remarkable that peritonitis docs not appear to be the chief danger of this operation. In neither of the cases above refeiTed to did it occur, the patient dying of erysipelas in Arnott’s case ; of recuiTent cancel, a year after the operation, in that of Storks.* OPER&.TION OP CASTRATION. This operation may be required for the various non-malignant affections of the testicle that have resisted ordinary constitutional and local treatment, and hai’e become soiu’ces of gxeat annoyance and discomfort to the patient; in the early forms of malignant disease, also, it may be advantageously practised. The operation may be pei’formed in the folloAving way. The patient, having had the pubes shaved, should lie upon his back ivith the legs and thighs hanging OA'er the end of the table. The Surgeon should then take his stand in front of the patient between his legs, and, grasping the tumour at its posterior part with his left hand, make the scrotum in front of it tense. If the mass to be removed be of small size, he makes a longitudinal incision over its anterior surface ; if of large size, a double elliptical incision, enclosing a portion of the scrotum. The incision should commence opposite to the external abdominal ring, and be canied rapidly down to the lower part of the scrotum. By a few touches with a broad-bladed scalpel or bistoury, Avhilst the skin is kept upon the stretch, the tumour is noAV* separated from its scrotal attachments, and merely left connected by the cord, Avhich must then be divided. In some cases, it Avdl be found advantageous to expose and diAude the cord in the first instance, before dissecting out the tumour fr'om the scrotum, as in this way a-better command over it is obtained. The Division of the Cord constitutes the most important part of the opera- tion, Avhether this be done first or last; as, unless care be taken, the cord may he retracted through the abdominal ring into the inguinal canal, where it is extremely difficult to foUoAV it, and Avhere the cut stump may bleed very fr'eely, pouring out the hlood into its OAvn areolar tissue so as to swell up rapidly, forming a large thi’omhus, and, if not j>roperly secured, giving rise to extensive and even fatal infiltration into and betAveen the muscles of the part and into the flank. This accident is prcA'ented by tying a piece of tape tightly romid the cord above the part to be cut, and giAong this into the charge of an , assistant (Tig. 804). The arteries of the cord may then be tied separately. A better and safer plan than this, hoAvever, and one Avhich I noAV invariably adopt, is to ligature the cord as a Avhole. This is done by passing a lAiece of strong AA'hipcord Auider the cord, and tying the Avhole of this structure very tightly before dividing it. In this Avay htemorrhage is most effectually restrained ; and the ligature separates about the eighth day. It is Avorthy of Testia" *^*^*'^ on tliia aubjoct to Cuiliiig’s excellent ■work on tho} 972 DISEASES OF THE TESTIS ANJ) CORD. lemailv, that the inclusion of the M'hole cord in the ligature gives rise to no Jifter-pain of any consequence. Sutures are seldom required, the edges coming into apposition of themseh-es; the wound must be lightly dressed, and allowed to heal by gi’anulation, bag- ging in the lower part being pre- ■vented during the after-treatment. In cancer of the testicle, it is of great consequence to divide the cord as high up as possible, for obvious reasons. It will not, however, be safe to do this opposite the abdo- minal ring in the way that has just been described, as there would not be sufficient space for the assistant to hold the cord aboA'e the part to bo divided. In cases of this kind, I have found it a good practice to expose the cord by dissection up to the abdominal ring; then to draw it well down, and to include the Avhole in a strong Avhipcord ligature, tied round it as tightly as possible. The section is then made a quarter of an inch below this, and the operation is completed as usual; the cut stump of the cord may retract into the inguinal canal, but cannot bleed if properly tied, and will ahvays be under command by drawing upon the whipcord. This plan of tying the cord cn masse Avas at one time generally adopted in all cases of castration, but is not now commonly employed. The objection to it is, that by comjAress- ing the spermatic nerves Avith the ligatm-e the after-pain is increased; but this certainly does not ahvays happen, for, in the instances in which I have done it, but little pain Avas complained of; and the practice in malignant disease of the testicle has the advantage of enabling the Surgeon to divide the cord at a higher point than he otherwise could ; which advantage is still further increased by the parts A\dthm and below the ligature sloughing aAvay, and thus eventually carrying the section to a level Avith the point tied. There is one danger that may occur in castration in young children. It is that in young subjects the processus vaginalis testis may not be obliterated, and that thus the peritoneum may be opened up into the wound on dividing the cord. In one case I have knoAvn this condition to lead to fatal peritonitis. Fig. 804.—Divisiou of tlie Cord in Castration. GBNEKAIi DIAGNOSIS OP SCROTAL TUMOURS. The diagnosis of scrotal tumoiu’s is not only of considerable importance, but ' is often attended Avith A'ery gveat difficulty: the more so, as they are frequently associated Avith one another, so that much tact and care are required to dis- criminate their true nature. Thus it is not uncommon to find a hydrocele and a hernia; a hydrocele and a A'aricoccle; or these affections co-existing with a solid tumour of the testicle. In other cases, again, as in the annexed973 DIAGNOSIS OF SCROTAL TUMOURS. « H-m-c an cnecplmloid tmnonr may co-cxist n ith a hydrocdo of the tunica vaijinalis, and with an encysted hydi'ocelo of the cold. Tumours of the scrotum may, m a diagnostic point o , two distinct classes 1, the Keduciblc ; and 2, the Irreducible. 1. llEDUCiimE Tl'MOUKS.—These are Hernia, Congenital Hydrocele, Diliuse Hydrocele of the cord*^ and Varicocele ; in all of which the swell- ing can be made to disappear more or less com- pletely by pressure and by the patient lying down ; reappearing on the removal of the pres- sure, or on his assuming the erect posture. The mode in which the tumour disappears, tends greatly to establish its diagnosis; though the general character of the swelling, and the history of the case, aftord important collateral evidence on this point. a. In Hernia there are the ordinary signs of this affection, such as impulse on coughing, &c. On reducing the tumoui’, it will be found that its return into the abdomen is accompanied by a gurgling noise, and by the sudden slip upwards of evidently a solid body. lit the other reducible tumours, the diminution and eventual disappearance under pressure are more gi’adual, and there is no reduction of the mass as a whole. b. The gradual squeezing out of the contents of a Congenital Hydrocele, together with its translucency, and the early age at which it occurs, will Fif;. S55. — Enceiilinloid Testicle h Hydroceles of the Tunica Vajii- Fif; xvith —j Tuilis and of the Cord. establish its time character. c. In the Diffuse Hydrocele of the Cord, there is an uniform semi- fluctuating swelling in and near the ring ; in which, however, there is no gurgling, &c., no complete and sudden disappearance as in hernia. It is also less defined, and has a less distinct impulse on coughing. (I. Varicocele may always be distinguished by its pyramidal shape, and its knotted, soft, and irregular feel. After being reduced when the patient lies down, it will, when he stands up, fill again, even though the Surgeon compress the external ring with his fingers. This sign, which distinguishes it from a hernia, occurs also in congenital hydrocele ; from which, however, the varico- cele may be distinguished by the absence of translucency, the want of fluctua- tion, and the general feel of the tumour. 2. Ihreducible Scrotal Tumours are of various kinds ; such as Omental Heniia, Hydrocele, Hmmatocele, the various forms of Sarcocele, and Cancer of the Testicle. These tumours, though presenting certain characters in com- mon, yet ditter somewhat in the predominance of particular signs. Thus, the shape of the tumour is usually pyi-iform iu hydrocele, globular in hmma- tocele, and oval in sarcocele ; though this is subject to much variation. The weight is least in hydrocele and greatest in sarcocele, proportionately to the size of the tumour. The characters of the surface present considerable dif- ferences, being smooth and tense in hydrocele and hmmatocele ; often ir- regular, hard, or knotted iu the other varieties. The rapidity of the formation of the tumour is greatest in hmmatocele.974 DISEASES OF THE TESTIS AND CORD. a. Irreducible Scrotal Hernia may be recognised by its irregular feel, by its impulse on coughing, by its occupation of the canal, and by the testicle being distinctly perceptible below it. l>‘ Hydrocele of the Tunica Vaginalis is always recognisable by its trans- lucency ; and the amount of opacity conjoined with this will enable the Surgeon to distinguish the degree of enlargement of the testis, and how fai- th ere is a sai’coccle conjoined with it. c. In Heematocele the tumour is of sudden or rapid formation, somewhat globular, opaque, but not very heavy or hard, and smooth upon the surface. (1. In Sarcocele genei-ally the tumour is hea-^7- for its size, frequently globular or irregular in shape, sometimes knobbed, and usually attended by a good deal of dragging pain in the groin, and frequently by some enlargement of the cord. In these three forms of scrotal tumour, viz., hydrocele, haBmatoccle, and sarcocele, the diagnosis can always be made at once from hernia, by the Surgeon feeling the cord free above the tumour. The point of most importance in the diagnosis of sarcocele is to distinguish the malifjnant from the non-malignant varieties. In the malignant the rapidity of the growth, the softness and the elasticity of the tumour, the im- plication of one testis only, and the early enlargement of the cord, with its indurated and knobbed condition, are important signs ; especially if the disease occur in young men. In a more adA'anced condition, the softening of the SAvelling at parts with a tuberous condition of the rest, and the occun-cnce of fungus with speedy constitutional cachexy, Avill point to the malignant nature of the tumour. In cases of much doubt and difficulty an exploratory puncture may be made, Avhen the contents of the groove in the needle or of the fine cannula will probably determine the character of the growth. In more than one instance, in which there was much obscurity, I have seen the true natin-e of the disease cleared up in this way. SPERMATOKKHCEA AND IMPOTENCE. Various forms of debility, of loss of power, or of irregularity of action in the generative organs of the male, are confounded together under the terms Spermatorrhoea and Impotence. These conditions require a more careful consideration on the part of the educated Surgeon than they have hitherto receiA'ed, as their existence is a source of the deepest mental depression and distress to the sufferer. They are certainly one cause of conjugal unhappiness, leading perhaps to infidehty on the part of the wife, and occasionally even to suicide of the husband. These affections, Avhich are of extreme frequency amongst aU classes of the community, haAung scarcely as yet received that attention on the part of the profession generally that their importance deserves, the unfortunate sufferers from them are too often driven into the hands ot those pestilent quacks who flourish in the metropolis, and infest almost every town in the country, by Avhom they are not unfrequently ruined in health as Avcll as in purse. The Sexual Melancholia that accompanies these conditions, is one of their more striking characteristics. The patient is languid in manner, depressed in975 TRUE SPERMATORRIKEA. spirits, Ws countenance is pale and haggard, eye dull expresstan listi* md devoid of all enevf^y. He takes no interest m tlie ordinary affairs of life, Ins whole thoughts are concentrated on his own condition and he feels himse de-n-aded as being unfit for that duty which is alike the first and the lon est of mSi. This state of mind is commonly the result of some local irritation or disease, re-acting on a morbidly sensitive nervous system ; and on examination, the Surgeon will commonly find some local condition that has been the star - ill" point of the mental malady. Balanitis, phimosis, or varicocele in the male ; uterine or ovarian irritation, congestion, or disease in the female, are the common occasioning causes. But the most frequent direct exciting cause is undoubtedly that pernicious and disgusting habit alike destructive of bodily vigour and of mental power, which, heedlessly contracted in youth, lays the foundation for an effete and impotent manhood, and for premature senility in the one sex, and entails hysteria, in its most aggravated and intractable fomis on the other. ^Ye may recognise at least three distinct varieties of generative debility in the male, of whom I alone speak, which may in some cases amount to actual impotence ; 1. True Spermatorrhoea, or Seminal Flux ; 2, Spasmodic Sper- matoiThoca, or Spermaspasmos ; and, 3, that arising from Want of Seminal Secretion, or Asperma. 1. True Spermatorrhoea, or Seminal Flux, is chiefly met with in young men usually from the ages of eighteen to thirty. It is commonly the conse- quence of that hideous sin, engendered by vice, and practised in solitude, which alike emasculates the body, enfeebles the mind, and degrades the moral nature of its perpetrator, or of debility of the generative organs induced by gonon-hoea, or of the continued struggle to repress the natural sexual desires by a life of forced or unavoidable continence. In this form of the disease there is a mixture of irritability and of debility. The generative organs are excited by slight emotional causes, or by trivial and ordinary physical stimuli —a thought, a look, a ivord, the movement of a carriage, the effort of strain- in" at stool, will excite the secretion of the testes, which the debilitated state of the parts allows to escape with a feeble ejaculatory effort, or in a kind of leakage of a few drops from the urethra. In the slighter cases, and in the earlier stages of the malady, these emissions take place but occasionally—three or four times a week, chiefly in the morning, in the mid state between waking and sleeping, and are preceded by an erection. In the more advanced stages, the emissions occur once or oftener in the twenty-four hours without an erection ; the semen at last, when discharged, flowing back into the neck of the bladder, escaping with each discharge of the urine, or being squeezed out after defecation. The patient’s physical and mental state becomes seriously implicated in these more advanced cases of true spermatorrhoea. His counte- nance is pallid, anmmic, and sallow ; his features are drawn, their expression is listless ; his eyes lifeless ; his spirits depressed, often to the lowest depths of despondency and despair. Connection is impracticable, as the discharge of semen takes place either before erection occurs, or without its occurrence. Diagnosis.—This form of spermatorrhoea is apt to bo confounded with frostatorrhaia (p. 870, vol. II.) ; but the diagnosis may always be effected by a microscopical examination of the discharge.1 97^5 niSEASES OF THE TESTIS AND CORD. An occasional inyohintary emission is not true spermaton-hoea. It is common to young men of an ardent and excitable temperament, and is often the occasion of much gTOundless alarm. It occurs at that period of life when the generative power and sexual feeling arc at their highest point of develop- ment. It is simply tlie result of a hypersecretion of the testes and ovei-flow of the semen. 1 or its repression, moral advice and medicinal agents arc equally unnecessary and unavailing. For it, early and congenial man-iage is the only remedy. Unless this be adopted. Nature will assert herself—she is indilferent to social considerations—she will enforce her rights in spite of all restraint. “Naturam expellas furca ; tamen usque recim-et.” Treatmenff.—The curative treatment should consist in giving tone to, and in lessening the irritability of, the genito-urinai’y organs. In these cases it Ijecomes necessary to maintain and improve the tone of the system by remedies calculated to remove the anaemia and to stimulate the nervous energies. With this view, the preparation of iron, phosj)horus, nux vomica, and cantharidcs will be found the most effective. The syrup of the phosphate of iron and strychnine, or the tincture of the perchloride of iron, in combination with those of nux vomica and cantharides, will be found of the greatest ser^dce. But under any form of treatment the cure will be slow, and long-continued perseverance in the use of remedies, local and constitutional, is imperatively necessary. In addition to these means the cold hip-bath should be assiduously employed. This the patient should use every night and morning ; remaining in it, at first, for about three minutes, but gradually increasing the time of immersion to ten or fifteen. The patient must sleep on a hard mattress, be lightly covered, and eat no supper. Some satisfactory mental occupation should also be provided, or travelling if possible. In some cases the cold shoAver-bath appears to give more tone, and then should be prefeiTed. These means, useful as adjuncts, will not, hoAvever, cure the patient. For this pur- pose, the local initability must be removed by the application of the nitrate of silver to the prostatic and bulbous portions of the urethra. It will usually be found that there is a good deal of tenderness in these situations, felt on pressing upon the perinmum, or on passing an instrument into the urethra, when, as the point enters the bulb, the patient vfill suffer much pain. The continu- ance of this irritation certainly keeps up the seminal emissions, and thus maintains the debility of the genital organs, and the nervous indtability, that are so characteristic of these cases. It may most effectually be remedied by the application of the nitrate of silver, as originally recommended by Lalle- mand ; and, if this be done in a proper manner, a cure Avill usually be accom- i Fig. 806.—Syringe-catlioter for aiii'lyiiig Caustic to tlie Urethra. plisM. Tor many years past I have employed, with miieh advantage m such cases, the instrnment here figured (Fig. 85C). It consists oi a silver catheter.977 IMPOTENCE. havino- about a dozen minute apertures near tbe end. In the intciioi is con- tained” a slender piece of sponge, about two inclies long, fixed to the expanded end of a firm stylet that moves within the catheter. The instrument is chaiged by filling the sponge with some solution of nitrate of silver by ivithdiaiui the stylet. It may then be well oiled ; and, being passed down to the spot to be Lnterised, the solution is forced out of the aperture by pushing don n the rod, which compresses the sponge. I have found this synnge-caUietei a safer and more manageable than Lallemand’s or porte-cmskims that aet by protruding a spoon or sponge, which is apt to be grasped by the spas- modic action of the muscles of the part, often being returned with difficulty into the shaft, and not without risk of lacerating the mucous membrane, i o-enerally use a solution of the strength of 5] of the nitrate to an ounce ot water ; though sometimes only a half or a third of this strength can be borne. The application nsnally occasions a good deal of irritation for a time, some- times even a mnco-pnrnlent discharge, and can only be repeated at intervals of from ten days to a fortnight. Any undue amount of irritation, particularly after application, must be subdued by ordinary antiphlogistic treatment. After the nitrate of silver has been used two or three times, the treatment may be advantageously continued bypassing twice a week a similar instrument charged with tannate of glycerine. This acts as an admirable astringent, and suits many people better than the nitrate. 2. Spasmodic Spermatoerhoea, or Spermaspasmos, more frequently occurs between the ages of twenty-five and forty. It is frequently predisposed to by residence in a warm climate, or by the existence of some disease about the generative organs ; such as stricture, varicocele, neuralgia testis, &c. In these cases there is not, properly speaking, a seminal flux ; but complete connection cannot be effected, as erection and ejaculation are either simultaneous acts, or the erection partially subsides before the emission takes place. This form of generative debility is often as much dependent on mental or moral as on purely physical causes. Treatment.—This is a condition of irritability rather than of debility. It often occurs in strong and otherwise healthy men, accustomed to field-sports and out-of-door exercises. There is no evidence of ancemia or of debility of any kiiid. Hence tonics are not necessary ; nor, indeed, would they be in any way useful. The remedy most to be relied upon is the bromide of potassium in doses of 20 to 30 grains, with local cold bathing, and, perhaps, when there is urethral initation, blisters to the perintnum and along the penis, with belladonna to the interior of the urethra. In addition to these means, it is of the first importance to enjoin moderation in food and drink, and above all, a'S'oidance of alcoholic stimuli; for, in many of these cases, it will be found that abdo- minal plethora co-exists, and exercises an injurious infiuence. 3. Impotence arising from absence of all sexual desire or power, or from premature decay of that power, is not unfr-equently met with, and often in individuals who are otherwise strong and healthy ; sometimes, indeed, in those characterised by great muscular power, and much given to athletic exercises. This want of sexual desire may be looked upon in many instances as a natural deficiency in the organisation of the individual, for which medical YOU. IT. 11DISEASES OF THE TESTIS AND CORD. 978 01 smgical treatment can do little. In other cases it arises from exhaustion of the nervous system by habitual physical or mental exertion, by excessive sexual indulgence, o^•er-training, or study, caiTied to too great and injurious a degree. Complete absence of seminal secretion—Asperma—except in cases of atrophy or absence of the testes, must be especially rare. In a patient of mine who died at 51 years of age, and who, according to his oivn and his wife’s account, had heen completely impotent for the twenty-four preceding years, spermatozoa in considciable (quantities weic after death found in the testes, which were carefully examined with the view of ascertaining whether they ever secreted semen. SrEniLiTY in the male is a condition that has attracted some amount of attention of late years. It is, of course, not unfrequently connected with, and probably dependent on, the same conditions that give rise to the various forms of sexual debility that have just been described. But it may occm- inde- pendently of any of these states, in individuals, indeed, who are possessed of a very considerable amount of sexual desire and vigour. It would appear to be due to some morbid condition of the seminal fluid, in consequence of which the spermatozoa are either absent, or are possessed of insufficient vitality to effect impregnation. The causes of this condition are very obsem-e ; but over- indulgence in sexual intercourse appears to be amongst the most frequent. It would seem as if each individual were endowed with a certain given amount of procreative power, which, if early exhausted, or habitually wasted in indis- criminate intercourse, cannot be restored. Hence, polygamists in the East, or theii’ Western congenera, do not propagate, as a rule, more than the average number of children. Amongst organic causes of this state, chronic epi- didymitis appears to be the most frequent (p. 943). The only Treatment that can be adopted with any prospect of success, is in the one case prolonged avoidance of sexual excitement, and in the other the removal of local disease existing in the urethra or testis, such as stricture, or thickening or condensa- tion of structure, by the long-continued use of absorbent remedies on general principles. Tonics are valueless in such cases. In conclusion I need scarcely say that, in the treatment of that general melancholia or hypochondriasis that accompanies these various affections, much good may be effected by means that directly influence the spirits and the mental condition of the patient. He should be encoimaged to travel, to occupy himself with healthy out-door pursuits and amusements, to take regular exercise, to avoid all enervating habits ; and, above all, his mind should be cheered by the hope of eventual cure. Should there be any local disease, such as balanitis, qffiimosis, or varicocele, that should be subjected to treatment or operation.979 SPECULUM VAGIN Ml. CHAPTER LXXV. DISEASES OF THE FEMALE GENITAL ORGANS. SOMK of the more important surgical affections of these organs, such as vagino- vesical and recto-vaginal fistulm, lacerated perinmum, &c., have already been discussed. The remaining affections, implicating the Vagina, the Uterus, and the Ovaries, are of considerable practical interest ; but, as their full con- sideration Avould lead me far beyond the limits that can be assigned to them in this -work, and, indeed, belongs to another department of Medicine, I must content myself with a brief indication of the principal surgical points deserving attention. INTRODUCTION OF INSTRUMENTS. SPECULmE VAGmiB.—Vaginal specula of various shapes and materials are commonly used by Surgeons. When the os and cervix of the uterus require exploration, the most convenient instrument is certainly the cylindrical reflecting glass speculum (Fig. 857); which, being coated with a layer of Fig. 808.-Br.mched Spoouluin. Fig. 859.-Bivalve Speculum. tmfod, covered by India-rubber, always presents internally a mirror-like surface, by Avluch a strong body of light is thrown into the bottom of the tube. 3 R 298o diseases of THE FEMALE GENITAL ORGANS. It has the additional advantage of being very cleanly, and not stained by any caustics that may be used in it. These specula should be of different sizes, and may be sometimes advantageously bevelled off at the inner end. When the wall of the vagina requires examination, as in some operations for fistula, a | bivalve speculum (Fig. 859), one with expanding blades (Fig. 858), a cylindrical one, provided with a sliding side, or the “duck-biUed” speculum (Fig. 81D) may advantageously be used. Introduction of the Speculum may readily be effected, without any exposure of the person, under the dress or bed-clothes. There are two positions in which the patient may conveniently be placed for this purpose. In the first, she lies upon her back, with the nates well raised or brought to the edge of the bed or couch, her legs separated, and her feet resting on two chairs; the Surgeon, standing or sitting in front of the patient, introduces the fore and middle fingers of his left hand into the vagina, dilates its walls, passes the speculum, well greased, gently and steadily between and under them. This position is the most convenient when caustics require to be applied, but is often objectionable to the patient, as it appears to entail much exposure, though in reaHty it need not do so. Another mode of introducing the speculum, which should always be adopted when practicable, consists in placing the patient on her left side across the bed, with the knees drawn up, and the nates near the edge; the instrument is then introduced in the same way as before, the Surgeon sitting by the patient’s side. In whichever way the speculum is used, no force should ever be employed; the patient should be placed opposite a good light, and care should be taken that the instrument be introduced fairly to the uterus, the position of which may have been pre^dously ascertained by tactile examination. Female Catheter.—The use of the female catheter is often required in various diseases and operative procedures about the genito-urinary organs of women. It should be introduced without exposure, by the aid of the touch alone. This may readily be done, as the patient lies in bed, under the clothes. The Surgeon, standing on her left side, passes his left index-finger downwards between the nymphm until he feels the projection of the meatus urinarius, immediately above the entrance into the vagina ; keeping his finger just below this, he uses it as a guide to direct the point of the catheter into the canal. Or the reverse way may be adopted : the Surgeon, passing his finger just into the orifice of the vagina, feels the urethra like a cord under the arch of the pubes. He carries it along this until the lu'ethral orifice is reached, when the catheter is slipped in. This method has the advantage that the clitoris is not touched, a matter of importance in hysterical females. DISEASES OP THE EXTERNAL ORGANS AND VAGINA. The vulva and the nymphte are the seats of numerous morbid conditions, , principally consisting of hypertrophy or of veiTucous growths from them, or the formation of cysts in their substance. Hypertrophy op the IjAbia to a limited extent is not unfr-equently met with, one labium hanging down considerably below the other. In these cases, it will often be found that the enlargement is due to a kind of solid oedema.981 IMP EPF OP A TE HYMEN. originally dopoiidcnt, perimps, upon a fissure or uloci f ?

Cystic Tuyiours are not unfrequently met with in the labia, and may sonie- times resemble rather closely the ordinary forms of inguinal hernia ; with which, however, their incompressibility, irreducibility, and the absence 01 impulse on coughing, will prevent their being confounded. These cysts, which recpiire removal by a little simple dissection, usually contain a dark, turbid, or sanguineous fluid, and sometimes atheromatous matter. Tolerably free hmmoi- rhage may follow their removal, the excitable tissues of the labia being cut into. This may, however, always be arrested by pressure and a T-bandage. Occasionally they project from the inside of the vagina, and then require removal by dissection or ligature, as can be best practised. InPERTORATE Vagixa is occasionally met with in young children, and occasions a good deal of anxiety to the parents. This condition, however, ma-y always be r ery readily and speedily removed by tearing open the canal, as it were, by dragging open its walls in opposite directions, and breaking through the adhesions, which are little more than epithelial, Avith the thumb-nail, a blunt probe, or the handle of a scalpel, and then introducing a small pledget of greased lint. IiiPERFORATE Hymen is occasionally met AAuth, causing great inconvenience, and even danger, by the retention of the menstrual secretion, which may accumulate to an immense extent, and become converted into a land of choco- late-coloured grumous fluid. This malformation does not usually attract attention until the age of seventeen or eighteen. "When the menstrual flux lias, hoAvever, not appeared, notwithstanding periodical constitutional distinb- ance, an examination is instituted, and the cause of the obstruction is revealed. Ill these cases the hymen, Avhich forms a dense elastic membrane, is pushed down betAveen the Auilvae, and the accumulated secretion may sometimes be felt as an elastic fluctuating tumour above the pubes or in the iliac fossa. The Trealmmt consists in puncturing the hymen Avith a trochar, enlargipg the opening Avith a probe-pointed bistoiuy, and thus discharging the retained fluid, Avhich may be in A'ery large quantity. This operation is not ahvays unattended by danger. Buppuration of the exposed cavity and peritonitis may come on, ending in the patient’s death. In opening the membrane, it need scarcely be said that Avouiid of the urethra should be carefully guarded against; and, Avith care, that canal may always be avoided. I have, however, seen one case in AA'hich it had been slit uji by the Surgeon who punctured the membrane. Occasionally the Surgeon’s advice may be sought by man-ied Avomen, for a rigid and only ^icirliallij 2^<^’>'forate It/ijmen; Avhon incision with a probe-pointed bistoury and dilatation Avith a sponge-tent may be required. Impregnation, however, is possible, even though the hjinen be not ruptured ; and it may be982 DISEASES OF THE FEMALE GENITAL ORGANS. necessary during parturition actually to complete the division of tliat mem- brane, if thickened and unruptured, though in most cases it gives way under the pressure of the foetal head. It may happen that surgical aid is needed to supplement conjugal efforts in the consummation of the marriage rite. In these so-called “ delicate ” cases, anesthesia having been induced, the Surgeon introduces a small bivalve speculum shut (Fig. 85!)), or an ordinary “ glove-stretcher,” and, expanding the blades, ruptures the hymen, and dilates the vagina to the necessary extent as he withdraws the instrument. Absence op the Uterus and Ovaries, with imperforate vagina, is occasionally met with in women, otherwise perfectly well formed : the external organs of generation, labia, and nymphte being present, and the breasts developed. In such cases, it is remarkable that sexual desire usually exists. The true condition may, however, be detected by an examination per rectum, and especially by the introduction of a catheter into the bladder whilst the finger is in the rectum, when the two cavities -will be found to be in close apposition without the intervention of uterus or ovaries, the point of the instrument being felt thinly covered through the gut. In two of the cases of this kind in which I have been consulted, there had been monthly epistaxis. No sm-gical interference can be of any avail in such cases ; and an attempt to restore the vagina would necessarily lead to fatal results by opening the peritoneal cavity. Occasionally, if the ivoman has been married, the i'ruitless attempt at coition on the part of the husband has caused dilatation and expansion of the urethral orifice to such an extent, that the index finger may be introduced into the cavity of the bladder. I have kno^m this expanded urethra mistaken for the vaginal aperture, coitus effected into it, and the existence of the malformation for a long time completely overlooked. Simultaneous vesical and rectal exploration will always clear up the true nature of the case. Hypertrophy of the Clitoris is occasionally met with : this organ becoming enlarged, elongated, and pendulous, and in some cases attaining an enormous size. Hargrave mentions an instance where it was found after removal to constitute a tumour weighing five pounds and a half. When the clitoris is enlarged, it may give rise to a good deal of irritation, and require excision, an operation that is often followed by rather troublesome hiemoiThage, requiring the use of the actual cautery for its arrest. Removal of the Clitoris, even though not enlarged, was some years ago recommended and extensiA'ely practised as a means of em’e in some foims of epilepsy and of erotomania. This is an operation as unscientific as it would be to remove the glans penis for the cure of similar affections in the male, and one that the experience of the profession has proved to be as useless in its results as it is unscientific in its principle. Tumours of various kinds are met with in the interior of the vagina, springing from its walls. These may be of a Cystic character ; but occasion- ally true Mucous Polypi are found dependent and projecting fr-om the side of this canal. These may most readily be removed by transfixing their base by a double whipcord ligature, and then strangling it. In performing this operation, however, ivhen the tumour grows from the posterior wall, care must983 DISCIIAIIGES FROM GENERATIVE ORGANS. be taken to ascertain by proper digital examination, that a portion of the rectum has not been dragged down into its base. VAGixAii IL'Emokuhoius are occasionally though rarely met ^^ith. They chiefly occur towards the anterior part of the vagina, or about the lower wall of the urethra, as rounded, smooth, purple masses of enlarged and congested veins. In one case I have seen a mass of this kind in an old lady give rise to permanent incontinence of urine or dysuria, by keeping the urethral aperture patent. Destnretion by the galvanic cautery is the best method of treatment. l’iiOL.tU>sus of the anterior or the posterior wall of the vagirra may ocerrr, giving rise, in the first instairce, to protrirsion of the bladder, or Cystocele ; in the other, to a Hectocele. In either case, but especially in the first, it occasions very serious and troirblesome consequences, amongst which chronic irritation of the mucous membrane of the bladder, with perhaps phosphatic deposits irr the uriire, are the most marked. These protrusions may be sup- ported by the use of properly constructed belts or pessaries. In some cases the Smgeon may feel disposed to undertake plastic operations, in order to narrow the vaginal orifice by freely paring the opposite portions of its walls, bringing together the freshened surfaces by means of the quilled sutiwe, and thus procuring narrowing of the canal and permanent support to the protruded part. The success of such operative proceedings will greatly depend on attention to details. The mucous membrane at the orifice of the vagina should be dissected off from about half an inch below the meatus on one side, to a corresponding part on the other, in a strip about an inch and a half Avide ; the dissection being carried Avell up posteriorly in the foiu’chette. Two or thi’ee deep, and as many superficial, sutures should be passed ; the deep being left in for about five, the superficial for seven days. Great attention should be paid to cleanliness, the patient lying on her side with a catheter in the bladder communicating with an India-rubber tube to carry off the lu-ine ; and the bowels should be confined by opium. Various Discharges connected with the female organs of generation fall under the observation of the Smgeon ; these may occur from the external organs, from the mucous membrane covering the cervix uteri, or from the interior of the caidty of that organ. These discharges, when proceeding from the mucous membrane covering the external organ, or lining the vagina, are frequently, though not necessarily, of a gonorrhoeal character ; and then require to be treated in the way that has been mentioned at page 855, Yol. II. When they are of a simple natime, proceeding fr-om mere excessive secretion of these parts, astringent injections, and attention to the general health, will usually succeed in effecting a cure. hen these discharges proceed from the cervix or the interior of the os uteri, they will commonly be found to be dependent upon a chronically inflamed or congested condition of the organ, or upon a papillated, granular, fissuied, or ulcerated condition of the mucous membrane, often connected with more or less local thickening and indm’ation of subjacent structures. These ■vaiious conditions, often of a very persistent, insidious, and destructive c laracter, have of late years been fully recognised by the labours of some of the French Surgeons, more particularly of liisfrauc, Emery, and Jobert ; and m this country their pathology has been greatly elucidated by Simpson and9S4 DISEASES OF THE FEMALE GENITAL OltGANS. fhe'tat f»f ''“""S P»i»W Ottt toll »'“‘''.‘’'“P “f that weve previously but imper- tol? /n ; ““"J' of “-aalW to'Ctiinal (tosos of the uterus are m reality clepeudeut upon eougestion, iufiammatiou, and other structural lesions of this organ. S//m^Aoms.~Thesc uterine discharges, occuring usually as the result of chionic inflammation and its consequences, just as we find on other mucous sui faces, as those^ of the urethra, throat, or eyelids, are attended by various symptoms mdicative of local distress : such as pain in the back and thio-hs and more especially in the left groin, with dysmenorrhoea, and usually a good’deal 0 sympathetic constitutional imtation, terminating in impaired digestion, malnutrition, and anaemia. It is in this condition of the system that many of the so-called hysterical affections are apt to arise ; and the Siu'geon often finds that the most inveterate cases of neuralgia of the joints, the spine, the hip, or the breasts, and of amam-otic and other obscure affections connected with nervous irritation, are primarily dependent on chronic uterine disease ; and it is only by attacking and removing this, that he can remedy the secondary mischief. On examining the condition of the cervix and os uteri in these cases by means of the speculum, various morbid changes are observed in them ; the cervix is perhaps thickened, indurated, or knobbed on one side ; the os is frequently patulous ; and the mucous membrane covering these parts will be observed to be erythematous, congested, and perhaps excoriated, not unfrequently in a granular condition, closely resembling what may be observed in some forms of gTanular conjunctivitis. In other cases, again, true ulcera- tion may exist both upon the cervix and within the os. These ulcers, abrasions, excoriations, or by whatever term they may be designated, are imquestionably a fruitful source of mischief in this situation, giving rise to considerable thickening of subjacent structures, and usually to abimdant muco-piunlent discharge and much sympathetic irritation. In character they closely resemble corresponding forms of disease met with on the mucous surface in other situations, not attended by loss of substance, but by the development of small pointed granulations or papillie, from which the discharge is pomed forth. The Treatment of these various affections of the uterus has been materially simplified since their pathology has been better imderstood ; and practitioners are now generally agreed as to the necessity of the emifioyment of energetic local measiu’es for the removal of these morbid states. To the Singeon who is in the habit of managing local disease on other mucous surfaces, and of removing the structiu’al lesions that result from chronic inflammation in other organs, the treatment of these cases can present little difficidty, as it is con- ducted on precisely the same principles that guide him in the management of similar affections elsewhere. The employment of caustics is of essential seindce in these various forms of chronic uterine disease. In cases of simple ulceration or excoriation, the nitrate of silver in stick, aj)plied every third or fom-th day, will frequently be found to effect a speedy cure. For this jpurpose, the hinged caustic-holder will be found a useful instrument. If there be much chronic induration, conjoined with the affection of the mucous membrane, the i^otassa cum calce, fused into narrow sticks, may very advantageously be used. In doing this, howevei*.9^5 TUMOUES OF THE UTERUS. ; be taken that the cauterising section do not extend too far. , after lio'htly touching the diseased part, whether this ho untoward will result. . . After the removal of the local disease in the way pointed out, any remaining congestion may be got rid of by the application of leeches to the cervix. Dm-ing the time when these local measures are being adopted, recourse must be had to jiroper constitutional treatment, with the view of improving the general health on ordinary medical principles. The details of this treatment need not be given here ; but for a full exposition of them, as well as for a vast deal of important information on the siu-gical management of uterine affections, I would refer the reader to the last edition of Bennet’s work on the Uterus. Uterine Displacement.—The various displacements to ivhich the uterus is liable, ivhether downwards, constituting Prolapsus, or in the direction of I the axis, being twisted, and either Retroverted or Anteverted, are causes of much local suffering and constitutional disturbance, and commonly req^uire surgical treatment. These various conditions will frequently be found deqien- dent on inflammatory congestion of the fundus, in consequence of which the organ becomes, as it were, top-heavy, and is tilted to one side, or descends bodily in the pelvis. The Treatment in such circumstances must have reference to the removal of the local tm’gescence by the application of leeches, the employment of astrin- gents, hip-baths, and the recumbent position ; occasionally assisted perhaqis, in twist of the organ, by attempts at replacing it by introducing the uterine sound into its caUty, or when it is prolapsed, by supporting it with appro- priate pessaries and the abdominal bandage. "NAginal Discharges of a purulent character not unfrequently occur in young female children, as the result of constitutional debility or strumous derangement. Occasionally such discharges lead to the suspicion of the child having been improperly tampered with ; and, although they may of course be occasioned by some violence inflicted on the genitals, or even from gonorrhoeal infection, it must be borne in mind that, in the great majority of instances, they certaiifly arise from constitutional conditions solely, and are in no way re- ferrible to external causes. The Treatment consists in attention to cleanliness, the use of warm lead lotions, and the improvement of the general health. Tumours of the Uterus are of various kinds. The most common are those of a Fibrous character. These are often of considerable size, and have been found weighing many poimds ; they may occupy almost any portion of the uterus, either projecting into the peritoneal cavity, occiqiying the interior of the organ, or dependent into the vagina. These tumours seldom occur I)cfore the age of thirty or forty, and are not very amenable to Treatment. In some cases, however, considerable benefit results from attention to position, tlie occasional application of leeches to the cervix, so as to lesson the conges- tion of the organ, and the introduction into the vagina every night of a ball9S6 diseases of THE FEMALE GENFl'AL ORGANS. composed of equ.al parts of strong mercurial ointment, Avax, and lard, or one containing iodine or the iodide of lead, with the view of acting as an absorbent on the inoi’bid tissue. Polypi are not imfrequently met with, growing from the inner surface of the uterus, usually fi-om its posterior aspect or fundus. These gi-owths are generally oval or pyriform, smooth, hard, insensible, and fibrous in structure. They are often the cause of repeated and dangerous haemorrhage ; and it is a remarkable fact that in many cases the most violent and persistent bleeding proceeds from the smallest tumours. In other cases, the polypi of the uterus are of a soft, fibro-cellular, vesicular, or mucous character, attended, like the harder ones, by free hiemorrhage. Treatment.—Polypi may be removed in various ways. 1. By terrsion. When the tumour is small and situated within the uterine cavity, a long pair of broad-ended forceps may be introduced through the patulous and turgid os, and the polyp readily twisted off from its attachment. 2. Bj excision. When the tumour is large and pyriform, has an elongated pedicle, and projects through the os, the patient may be placed in the position for lithotomy, and the labia opened and held aside by retractors : the gvowth may then be draAvn down by a large pair of vulsellum-forceps, so as to bring its neck well within reach, and this may then be cut across with a long pair of scissors or a probe- pointed bistoury. After removal, a pledget of lint, soaked in a solution of perchloride of iron, should be, pressed against the stump of the pedicle. If haemorrhage occm’, the cut siu’face may be touched by the actual cautery passed up through a speculum. 3. The pedicle of the polyp, having been brought into xdew as just described, may be divided by the ecraseur, the same jerecautions as to hsemoirhage being taken. 4. The pedicle may be ligatured. This may either be done by bringing dovm the tumom as directed above, transfixing its neck with a large naevus-needle carrying a double whipcord ligatiu’e, and tying it in two halves. In order to prevent the annoyance resulting from the decomposition of the ligatmed mass, the pedicle may be cut across immediately under the part to which the ligatine has been applied. In some cases the ligature is gradually tightened. This operation is done by means of a whipcord applied by Gooch’s double cannula, which has been variously modified and a good deal improved by different Surgeons. The ligature usually cuts its way through in from thi-ee to five days ; the tumour swells, and decomposes, often vfith a good deal of foetid discharge, which requires to be carefully syringed away by means of dilute chlorinated lotions. It is a useful precaution not to apply the ligatine too near the uterine end of the pedicle ; as cases have occinred in which, by so doing, the Surgeon has given rise to serious and even fatal inflammation of the womb. Any portion of pedicle that is left after the ligature has separated will graduaUy undergo absorption. Of these various methods, I think that, in the treatment of laige pohqii, removal by the (icraseur, or the transfixion and ligature of the neck ot the tumour and the immediate excision of the part below the ligature, is the safest, most expeditious, and the best. _ Cauliflower Excrescence from the uterus, attended by copious discharge, is a rare and dangerous affection. The only Treatment that appears to be o any avail, is to draw doivn the neck of the uterus by means of a vulseUum, and987 DIAGNOSIS OF OVARIAN TU2I0URS. le tumour with the surface 011 which it grows. This operation The Treatment of these cases must be of a purely palhative character ; administration of opiates and the use of chloi-inated lotions must bo principally relied on Excision of the diseased cervix has been recommended, and was formerly a good deal practised ; but this is a barbarous procedure, and con- trary to every principle of good surgery, as it is impossible to rid the patient of scirrhous disease by the partial removal of the affected organ, and its complete extirpation cannot lie thought of. Tumom-s, however, of a simple character requiring removal are occasionally met with, springing from the cervix ; they may be excised by putting the patient in the position for lithotomy, drawing the uterus well down with forceps, and removing them with the knife. This has been done during pregnancy, and even dm'ing par- turition, with good effects. Ovarian tumoms of a cystic character are commonly met with. The cysts may be uni- or multi-locuiar, and vary greatly in the nature of their contents. These may be either solid or fluid—often a combination of the two. If fluid, the liquid is usually more or less viscid, albuminous, dark and variously coloured. Ovarian tumour, if left without treatment, invariably ends fatallyin some cases rapidly, in most gradually, occupying many years in its course. Diagnosis.—It is not my intention to enter into the difficult subject of the diagnosis of ovarian tumom’S, which would lead me too far into the pro^flnee of the Physician. From pregnancy, ascites, tumours of the uterus and omentum, dropsical dilatation of the Fallopian tube, hydronephrosis, enlarge- ments of the liver, kidney, spleen, and stomach, hydatids, hysterical tympanites, fat in the omentum, stercoraceous accumulations, distension of the bladder, spinal curvature, abdominal and pelvic abscesses, the diagnosis has carefully to be made ; and that this is a matter of no slight difficulty, is evident from the numerous cases in Avhich errors have happened and are constantly occur- ring to the most experienced practitioners. It is impossible for the Surgeon to be too cautious in effecting a diagnosis before he proceeds to open the abdominal cavity in any supposed case of ovarian disease. And notwithstand- ing the great attention that has been expended on this subject, and the vast improvements in diagnosis that have been effected of late years, such errors are still of constant occurrence—even to the most experienced and skilful in the treatment of ovarian disease. Treatment.—The treatment of ovarian tumour may be conducted :—1, by ^Medical Means ; 2, by Tapping ; 3, by Tapping conjoined with Auxiliary Measures ; 4, by Injection ; 5, by Ovariotomy. OVARIAN TUMOURS AND DROPSY.988 DISEASES OF THE FEMALE GENITAL OIIGANS. 1. Medical Means exercise no influence in curing ovarian tumours, and but little, if any, in retarding tbeir progress. Specific treatment by means of mercury or iodine has always appeared to mo to hasten the progress of the malady, by breaking down the constitutional powers of the patient ; and attempts at promoting the absorption of the fluid by purgatives, diuretics, &c. are invariably unsuccessful. An ovarian cyst is a parasitic gi’owth, the tissues and structure of which are not inlluenced to increased power of absorption by the action of dcobstruents on the system generally. The utmost that can be done by medical means in such cases is, to attend to the general health and to support the patient’s strength by tonics. 2. Tapping in ovarian dropsy may be done as for ascites, through the linea alba ; but not mifrequently the tumoiu' presents more distinctly at some other- part of the abdominal wall, and may be emptied through the liuca semi- lunaris ; or, if multilocular, it may require the trochar to be inserted at dificrent points into its separate compartments. The paracentesis of ovarian cysts shordd, unless the disease be very acute, always be deferred as long as is compatible rvith the comfort of the patient; as it is not only followed by speedy re-accumirlation of the fluid, and often by rapid exhaustion, few patients surviving the first operation more than three or form years ; but is attended by certain special dangers, such as the risk of peritonitis, of exhaustion, or possibly even of the pmicture of the bladder, or of a coil of small intestine, Avhich is sometimes adherent to the anterior Avail of the ovarian cyst, and may be met with where httle expected. But independently of any positive danger of this kind, tapping an ovarian tumour is, as will immediately be stated, an operation that not only holds out no prospect of cure, but that is indeed usually the preciu-sor of a more speedily fatal termination to the case than Avould otherwise occur. As a means of temporary relief it is clearly only applicable to unilocular cysts or to those multilocular tumours in Avhich one cyst takes greatly the lead in point of size over the others. Indeed, so disastrous ai-e the results of tapping that, since the dev-elopment of ovariotomy and the increasing success of that operation, it is not often had recom-se to, being only practised in certain exceptional cases that either do not admit of complete extirpation of the tumoiu-, or in Avhich it is necessary for various reasons to defer that operation. 3. Tapping, conjoined witli Auxiliary Means, has occasionally suc- ceeded in effecting a cure of unilocular ovarian cysts. These auxihary means are of various kinds ; firm pressiue ; incision of the cyst; excision of a por- tion of its wall, plugging the apertiue in it ivith a tent; the introduction of a catheter or tube ; the establishment of a fistulous opening leading into the interior of the cyst, either through the anterior abdominal Ai all or thiough the vagina, have all been adopted in addition to simple tapping. However much these different procedures may vary in detail, they are aU conducted on one . principle ; viz., that of causing the gradual contraction^ of the cyst and the cohesion of its -walls—a principle of treatment Avhich is only applicable to unilocular cysts, and hence can only be had recourse to in a small number of cases, and those the simplest, of ovarian tumour. None of these means can be looked upon as curative, so far as ovarian disease is concerned. By means of them the cyst that is chiefly enlarged maybe made to coUapsc and conti-act.989 HISTORY OF OVARIOTOMY. But secondary cysts developed in its wall, or at its base, and whose develop- ment has been kept in abeyance l)y the pressure and absorption of nutrition by the larger cyst, will commonly begin to grow when this has been reduced in bulk ; and thus eventually a multilocular tumour may be substituted for an apparently unilocular cyst. These measures hai’e also, like tapping, given way to the safer and more certain procedure of o’^'ariotomy, and are now confined to those cases in which ftom adhesions on the tumour it cannot be remoi’ed in its entirety. -k Injection of Tincture of Iodine has been occasionally employed both in this country and the Continent. After the tumour has been tapped, from four to six ounces of the tincture are injected through a catheter, passed dmni the cannula, and left in. The immediate effect of this injection is the contraction of the cyst ; the secondary effect, the effusion of plastic matter within it. In some cases no constitutional disturbance follows ; in others, a severe febrile paroxysm, accompanied by intense iodism, the urine and saliva being impregnated with iodine; and in others again, suppuration of the cyst, with fiital peritonitis, has resulted. This method of treatment is only aiiplicable, however, to non-adherent unilocular cysts : and in them it must be looked upon as palliative rather than curative—the cyst collapsing, and the tumour perhaps reemring in another form. It is, however, so very uncertain in its results—so entirely palliative and so manifestly inferior as a method of cure of ovariotomy, that it is now, I believe, generally abandoned. 0. Ovariotomy is probably the greatest triumph of modem Siu’gery in its operative department. In its original conception, as in its ultimate perfection, it reflects the gveatest lustre on the British School of Surgery. Its history is curious. Its progress was slow, and was marked by those oscillations in the judgment and the favour of the Profession which frequently precede the final establishment of a great advance in practice. The operation was originally proposed, and its practicability discussed in 17G2, by William Hunter. It was strongly advocated and its practicability taught by John Bell, at a later period. It is said to have been performed in France, by L’Aumonier, in 1782, in a case of scirrhous disease with abscess” of the ovaiy ; the patient recovering. A pupil of John BeU—McDowell of Kentucky —first performed the operation in America in 1809 ; he followed up his case by others, and in all operated thirteen times. In 1823, Lizars operated for the first time in this country. But the operation, though several times repeated, fell into discredit, in a great measure owing to the imperfection of the diagnosis of the cases in which it was done, and was not revived until 183fi, when Jeaffreson of Framliugham practised it successfully through a small incision an inch and a half long only. From this operation we must date the revival of ovariotomy in Great Britain. This operation was followed by others performed by King of Saxmundham, Crisp of Harleston, and West of Tonbridge. The example of these provincial Surgeons was followed by their brethren in London, and the operation was practised by many, especially by Walne, F. Bird, and Baker Brown, but with A'cry discouraging results ; for of ] G2 cases collected by Kobert Lee, in GO the disease could not be removed, and of these 19 died ; whilst of the remaining 102, 42 terminated fatally! Xot only did these unfavourable results discourage the Profession, but aDISEASES OF THE FEAIALE GENITAL ORGANS. 990 growing belief sprung up that this mortality, groat as it Avas, did not by any means represent the whole extent of the fatal cases, and notwithstanding that to operate, ovariotomy was in great danger ot tailing into such disrepute as to be excluded from ordinary Surgical practice. In 1857 appears for the first time in connexion with ovariotomy the name of a Surgeon, Avho Avas not only destined to revive ovaidotomy, but to re-establish it fiimly and definitively amongst the great operations in surgery; for in December of that year Spencer Wells performed his first operation of this kind. Tliis case, the first of a series of 500 cases that have been published up to the year 1872, led to a revival of the operation. In Spencer Wells’s hands ovariotomy assumed a iieAv shape ; its performance was guided by certain definite rules, and the results were of the most brilliant and successful kind. Not only has the success of these operations been unprecedentedly great, but it has been steadily increasing ; of the first series of 100 cases, 34 died and CO recovered ; of the second series, 28 died and 72 recovered; of the third 100 cases, 23 died and 77 recovered; of the fourth, 22 died and 78 recovered; and in the fifth, 20 died and 80 recovered. Up to the end of 1876, the total number of cases operated on by Spencer Wells had amounted to the large number of 820, Avith 618 recoveries and 202 deaths. The last series of 320 cases showing 245 recoveries against 75 deaths; the last 20 cases being all successful. These results, admirable as they are, will probably still be im- proved upon, and Wells is of ojAinion that the mortality may be still further reduced so as to bring it down to 10 ]Aer cent. This Ioav death-rate has been nearly attained by Keith of Edinburgh ; Avho, in his series of 50 cases recorded in June, 1875, had only 6 deaths. In addition to this, the diagnosis of ovarian diseases and ol other abdominal tumours has been greatly perfected, so that the number of cases in Avhich the operation is attempted but cannot be com- pleted, has greatly lessened. In the face of such results as these it is no longer necessary to enter into any formal arguments as to the propriety of performing ovariotomy. Without doing so at any length it may, hoAvever, be stated that the operation has been chiefly condemned and cavilled at on tAvo grounds ; 1st, that, as the disease for which it has been proposed is not necessarily fatal, or, at all events, not incompatible Avith long life, it is not proper to subject the patient to a hazardous procedure for its removal ; and, 2nd, that the mortality ft’om the operation is so high as not to justify a Surgeon in performing it. With regard to the fii'st objection, it may be stated that ovarian disease is attended by very great discomfort and inconvenience in all cases ; that it pre- vents a Avoman from discharging the active duties of life, and, amongst the poorer classes, from obtaining a livelihood ; and that, so far from being a com- paratively innocuous affection, it Avastes and enfeebles the patient, interfering seriously with nutrition, and Avith the actions of the abdominal or pelvic organs, and is not generally compatible Avith prolonged existence. R. Lee states that about 80 per cent, of the cases that are not operated upon, die Avithin one year and three quarters after the appearance of the disease. When it groAvs rapidly, or so soon as it attains such a size as to require tapping, death takes place- much more quickly. Safford Lee states that of 46 patients Avith OA’arian dis- ease, Avho Avere tapped, 37 died, and only 9 recovered ; and that of the 37 AvholiESULTS OF OVARIOTOMY. 99^ died, more than one-half did so in four months from the first tapping, and 27 out of the 37 within a twelvemonth, and of these 18 were tapped once on y. In those who survive, repeated tappings arc required at constantly decreasing intciwals. i a rn The second objection can have little weight with any practical burgeon, i he mortality after ovariotomy is not so high as that after maiy operations which no Surgeon would hesitate for a moment in performing. It is true that in some of these cases, as in the ligature of the larger arteries for aneurism speedy death would be the penalty of non-interference ; whereas, in ovarian disease, a miserable existence may be protracted for some months after the tumour has attained so great a hulk as to render surgical aid necessary. But in other surgical diseases in which operations of the gravest character are performed without hesitation, as in the removal of the upper jaw for tumour, or in am- putation at the hip-joint for tumours of the femur, the same objection would hold good. The diseases for which these great and dangerous operations are performed, are not incompatible with some months or even years of painful existence*; yet the Surgeon does not hesitate to give the patient the chance of a doubtful recovery, in order to extricate him from the miseries of prolonged suffering. It is not necessary, in order to justify an operation even of a dan- gerous character, that the patient be in immeduitR peril of death. It is suffi- cient that the death from the disease which it is proposed to remove should ultimately be certain, though it may be delayed by months or years of previous suffering. From this point of view ovariotomy appears to me to be a perfectly proper and justifiable operation, and it presents the advantage of the cure, if the patient recover, being complete and permanent. In it there is no mean ; the death is speedy, or the cure complete. Clay of Birmingham, in the appendix to his translation of Kiwisch’s Chapters on Disease of the Ovaries, has collected from various soiuces the parti- culars of oG7 cases. Of these, the operation was completed by the removal of the entire ovarian tumour in 425, or about three-fourths ; the mortality being- 183, or about 43 per cent.. In 24 cases, the tumour was only partially re- moved ; of these 14 died. In 13 cases, extra-ovarian (mostly uterine) tiunours were removed ; the mortahty here amounted to 10. Of 105 cases in which the operation was abandoned, there Avere adhesions in 82 ; and in 23 the disease Avas mostly extra-ovarian, Avhile in a foAv no tumour Avas found. Amongst these 105 abandoned cases, 27 died. The results of ovariotomy in the hands of those Avho have most extensively practised it of late years—as Baker BroAvn, Tyler (Smith, Spencer Wells, Keith, Atlee, and Kocberle—are, however, much more favourable : especially those of Spencer Wells and Keith. The mortality after ovariotomy appears to be increased by the existence of adhesions. When these complicated the operation, in those cases in Avhich the- ovarian tumour Avas completely removed, 49 per cent, of the cases died ; Avheu they did not exist, only 32 per cent. Avere fatal. In Wells’s first 500 cases, the proportions Avere about 33 and 20 per cent. rcspcctiA-ely. AVhen Ave compare these returns, not only Avith the mortality Avhich folloAVS operations of immediate urgency—as primary amputation of the thigh for injury—but with that Avhich attends great operations for diseases that might be palliated and in which existence migdit be protracted for some little time992 DISEASES OF THE FEMALE GENITAL ORGANS. ns amputation at the liip-joint ibr tumour, or the ligature of the innominate and subclaTiau arteries for aneurism, or even lithotomy for the extraction of vesical calculus of large size in the adult—ive cannot consider the mortality after ovariotomy so gi-eat as to interfere with the performance of the operation, if other circumstances justify it. It has further l^een objected to ovariotomy, that it has not nnlrecpientlv happened that, after the operation has been commenced, it has been found impossible to complete it, owing to the existence of adhesions between the tumour and the contents of the abdomen. This objection is certainly a grave one ; but I bclieA e that, with care in examining the tumour, and ascertaininij its mobility during respiration, the existence or absence of crackling under the abdominal v all dining the respiratory movements, the freedom from connec- tion with the uterus, as determined by finding that organ floating on the intro- duction of the uterine sound, and the previous non-occnrrence of peritonitis, this mistake is not now so likely to happen as formerly, Avhen the h’abilityto it was not suspected. Operation.—On the day preceding the operation, a dose of castor-oil should be administered, and on the morning of it an enema, so that the bowels may be completely emptied. The room should be airy, warm, and well ventilated. Chloroform having been administered, and the bladder emptied by the catheter, the patient must be placed upon a table covered with blankets, in such a way that the legs hang over the end of it, and the abdomen is faMy and evenly exposed. The Surgeon, taking his stand between the patient’s legs, or at her left side, makes an incision, usually about four inches in length, from the um- bilicus downwards, directly in the mesial line ; by a few touches of the knife, the structures, which are usually much thinned, are divided along the linea alba, and the abdominal cavity is opened. There has been much discussion as to the length to which the incision in the abdominal wall should be made ; some practitioners recommending that this should be of very limited extent, others that it should reach from the ■ensiform cartilage to the pubes. No definite rule, can be laid down upon this point. The incision must be proportioned in extent to the size and nature of the tumour, and the existence or absence of adhesions. If the tumour be cystic and unilocular, and not adherent, it may be readily enough extracted by making an incision only an inch or two in length in the mid-line, tapping it thi-ongh this, and then drawing the emptied cysts forwards by means of a vnlsellnm. If, on the other hand, the ovarian growth be chiefly solid, a larger incision, from four to six inches in extent, wiU be required. Should adhesions exist, it may even be necessary to go beyond this ; though I cannot believe that it is ever necessary to rip up the abdomen from the sternum to the pubes, for the removal of any tumour, however large or adherent. In making this incision, the Surgeon must be careful to open the peritoneum fairly, and not to mistake it for the cyst-wall, and so strip it off the inside of the abdominal muscles. The tumour now comes into view ; if cystic, it must be tapped with a large and long trochar, and the fluid evacuated. Especial care should be taken not to allow this viscid ovarian fluid to escape into and flood the alidominal and pelvic ca^dties. This may often be avoided by conducting it away from theOF THE FEDICLE. 993 MAN AGE ME XT patient, by means of a vulcanised India-rubber tube attached to the caiinula. In this way, the size of the tumour may be so much lessened as to admit of its more ready extraction. If cystic, and emptied, it may now perhaps t>c draA\n out through the incision in the abdominal wall without further difficulty. It it be solid, or if there be any adhesions, the Surgeon must introduce his hand, and, liy sweeping it round the tumour assist in removing the mass. ctiiet difficulty in the'opcration will consist in the presence of adhesions. Should none exist, nothing can be simpler than the extraction of the tumour, iidiich has a tendency to protrude forwards into the wound. Should they be slight and confined to its anterior part, attaching this to the abdominal wall, they may readily enough bo broken through by the hand being swept round the forepart of the tumour. If they be firm, deep, and extensive, then the real difficulty of the operation will have to be encountered. It is, however, important to observe that adhesions of this kind will chiefly be found at the anterioi part, betn een the tumour and the abdominal wall; comparatively seldom posteriorly, or con- nected with any of the abdominal viscera, except the uterus. If possible, these adhesions should not be cut across, as they often contain vessels that would bleed freely if so divided; but they should rather be torn no slight foice occasionally being required to detach them. Should the tumour be so closely adherent to any viscus that its separation is attended with danger, it might be safer to cut across the cyst-w'all, and leave the adherent portion of this, than to run the risk of laceration of the liver or intestine. During the withdrawal or protrusion of the mass from the abdomen, an assistant on each side must press gently upon the sides of the incision Avith the hands or Avith soft napkins, so as to prevent the protrusion of the intestines, Avhich, if possible, should not be seen dining the operation. The tendency to intestinal protrusion some- times occasions considerable trouble ; especially if the patient have taken chloroform and begin to vomit, Avhen it may be necessary to discontinue the operation for a time. The Management of the Pedicle, including its seizure and division, is the next step in the operation, and probably the most important. It is the one on Avhich the greatest amount of difference of practice exists. There are three methods of seem-ing the pedicle adopted by different ovario- tomists and Surgeons, viz., the ligature, the damp, and the damp conjoined Avith cauterisation. The proper treatment of the pedicle involves two points : fii’st, and necessarily, the aiTest of hmmorrhage from its divided vessels ; and secondly, the question as to whether its stump should be left out of the wound or allowed to drop into the peritoneal cavity. The earlier operators used the Ligature; and many still employ it. This is certainly the simplest, and appears to me to be the safest, method of guard- ing against haimorrhage from the cut stump. A strong, Avell-Avaxed whipcord ligature should be used. "When the pedicle is long and narroAv, there can be no difficulty in applying this ; Avhen short, thick, or broad, the ligature is not so easily applied. The tumour must then be drawn fonvards, and the struc- tures of the pedicle either expanded out or unravelled, as it Avere, Avhen a double ligature can be passed across it, the loop snipped, and the pedicle tied in tAvo portions ; or the whipcord may be passed by means of a na3vus-ueedle, Avhich is made to transfix the pedicle at some point Avhich the Surgeon has. VOL. n. •] g994 DISEASES OF THE FEMALE GENITAL ORGANS. previously ascertained to Idb free from blood-vessels, and then securely knotted on each side. Great care must be taken in tying the pedicle -s'cry tiglitly, for undoubtedly one of the great disadvantages of the ligature is that, owing to the shrivelling of the pedicle, it is apt to slip, and thus to lead to a fata! haemorrhage. There are two methods of dealing with the ends of the ligatures. The fii-st is, to leaA'e them and the stump of the pedicle out of the wound, securing them to the edges of the abdominal incision, or to the harelip pins ley -which it has been brought together. This method I formerly used and advocated ; but more recent experience leads me to concur with those who consider it as favouring suppuration, sloughing, and purulent deposits in the lower part of the w'ound and the pelvic cavity. With respect to the question of keeping the stump out of or allowing it to drop into the peritoneum, opinion is divided. Some of the earlier American ovariotomists, especially D. L. Rogers, cut the ligatures short and returned the stiunp of the pedicle into the wound. This practice was revived by Tyler Smith in 18Gl, and has been adopted by him, by T. Bryant and others, with excellent results, the ligatures either becoming encapsuled or being discharged after a time through a suppurating track. But when the clamp is used the case is different. Here the opinion of Sj)encer WeUs, backed as it is by his extensive experience, is as positive as it is valuable. He strongly advocates the practice of seeming the pedicle ■with the clamp outside the wound, so that it should not drop down between the lips of the incision in the skin and abdominal wall. The mortality of cases so treated was 19.7 per cent. He strongly deprecates aU minor and mixed methods of keeping the pedicle out of the incision, as being far inferior to the clamp in effecting tliis object. The mortality after the wi/ra-peritoneal treatment of the stump was 38‘6, or as nearly as possible double that of the ea:b*«-peritoneal plan of treatment; and these figmes appear to be conclusive as to the relative merits of the two. I forbear to speak of the employment of silver, lead, or other metallic ligatures, as they have fallen into disuse, and been aban- doned by the most experi- enced ovariotomists; as also have the methods of bringing the ends of the threads out through the ‘‘ fovea inguinalis interna ” or the vaginal septum, which are manifestly not worthy of adoption.

The the obvious disadvantages of fayooriiig Biippiiratioii, and of not being a positively effectual seenrily a-ainst tomorrhage, the Clamp was introduced as a substitute by J. Hntclnn-AFTER-TREATMENT IN OVARIOTOMY. 995 son in 1858, and, after having’ undergone A’arious modifications, is now, in some shape or other, employed by very many ovariotomists. Tlie object of the clamp is to compress the pedicle securely until loosened by suppuration. The clamp originally employed was a pair of carpenter’s callipers : those now used by Spencer AVells are here figured (Figs. 8G0, 8C1). They are so con- structed that, after their application, the handles can be removed, and the compressor alone left on the pedicle. The action of this instrument is obvious. The pedicle, being seized, is firmly compressed, and then cut through about half an inch above tlie clamp. 'J’his, being concave on the upper surface, allows the stump to )je dressed easily, and acts as a saucer to collect any discharge. The ligature of independent-vessels may also be combined Avith compression of the Avhole pedicle by the clamp. Cauterisation Avith compression Avas introduced by Baker Brown as a means of securing the pedicle and arresting hgemorrhage. It is a method that has not been very generally adopted, OAving to the liability to recun-ent ha3raorrhagc that accompanies it. According to Lloyd Boberts, of Manchester, in an excel- lent paper on the treatment of the pedicle, this happens in one out of four cases. It is apt to occur Avhen only the cut surface of the pedicle is cau- terised ; the eschar being then too weak to restrain the pressure in the arteries. It is best guarded against by searing and coagulating at least an inch of the pedicle. Shoidd it be thought desirable to use cauterisation, the best instrument would be Chambers’s actual cautery parallel clamp (Fig. 862). The incision in the abdominal Avail should be closed by the continuous sutine passed from Avithin outAvards. For this purpose a silver wire or carbolised silk suture may be used, and care should be taken that the ojAposite sides of the peri- toneum are brought Avell into contact and fastened together. The abdominal wall must be still finther supported by broad and long slips of plaster, and a laced napkin round the body. Should it unfortunately be found, during the progress of the operation, that adhesions exist, so close and extensive as to prevent the removal of the tumour, the wound in the abdominal AA’all must be closed, and the same after-treatment adopted as in the successfuUy completed operation. The After-treatment of the case will require the most careful attention, although it presents nothing of a very special character, or that differs from the management of ordinary ab- dominal operations. The dangers to be apprehended are from peritonitis, exhaustion, aiid secondary htemorrhage. Perito- nitis rcquiies to bo more carefully guarded against than perhaps any other co;ai- plication : of 150 fatal cases, it Avas the cause of death in O-f, or -12 per cent. Pure air, perfect cleanliness, complete quiet, and the undiA'ided attention of a skilled nurse, arc, according to Spencer Wells, the main requisites. The patient should bo kept in bod, in a uniform temperature. Nothing but ice and barley- or Seltzer-water, brandy, and beef-tea should be allowed for several days; and opium given, if necessary. The urine must be drawn off thrice in :s s 2 Fig. Sl52. — Cliiim- Ami-s’s Actiuol C.uitciy Claniii.996 DISEASES OF THE FEMALE GENITAL ORGANS. the twenty-four hours ; but the bowels should be left unrelieved for several days, and then merely opened by an enema. As no solid food should be- talcen during this time, little inconvenience results. If peritonitis come on, it must bo treated in accordance with the rules laid down when speaking of that which folloAvs strangulated hernia. Should symptoms of exhaustion manifest themselves, the patient must be kept up by wine or brandy, repeated as frequently as the irritable state of the stomach will permit. After recovery from ovariotomy, the cure is usually complete. Impregna- tion may occur through the medium of the ovary that is left; and partmTtion may be safely accomplished. In some rare instances, however, the rdtimate rcsidt is not so fortunate. If the tumour have been malignant, recuiTence may take place ; and occasionally the ovary that is left becomes the seat of disease, so as to necessitate a second operation. Hernia of the Ovary. It may happen that the ovary, on one or both sides, becomes displaced, and escapes from the pelvis through one of the openings which give passage to intestinal hernia. In three-fourths of the recorded cases (twenty-seven out of thirty-eight, according to Englisch of Vienna) the displacement has been inguinal. In nearly one half of the cases it was congenital; aU these were instances of inguinal displacement; and aU the instances of double ovarian hernia were inguinal and congenital. The Causes of the displacement in the adidt are not easily ascertained. In the congenital cases it would seem as if an abnormal descent of the ovary took place, analogous to the descent of the testis in the male. Symptoms. Congenital ovarian hernia is nearly always in'educible; while in most cases of acquired displacement of the ovary, it has been possible to return the tumoiu’ into the abdomen. The swelling is generally pyriform in the inguinal region, rounder in the femoral. There is no constant diagnostic symptoms ; but in several instances it has been noticed that the hernia became more tender on pressime, and larger, diming menstruation. At this time, also, inflammation of the ovary may take place ; and, being attended with vomiting, may lead the Simgeon to imagine that the case is one of strangulated hernia. The diagnosis here is not easy ; indeed, according to Englisch, of twenty cases, in which symptoms of strangulated hernia were present, a correct diagnosis was made in seven only. The difliculty of diagnosis would be much increased if an intestinal or omental hernia were present with the ovarian. Abscess or sloughing of the displaced ovary occasionally occims. Treatment. So long as the hernia presents no special symptoms there is httle or no occasion for interference, beyond the wearing of a properly fitted truss. If inflammation occim, the case must be treated on ordinary principles ; and if the ovary suppurate, the abscess should be opened. ^Vhen the ovary is very painful, or has become cystic, extirpation may be practised.ADDENDUM TO VOLUME II. Page 300. TREATMENT OF DISEASED SPINE BY PLASTER OF PARIS BANDAGE. ])r. Lewis A, Sayre, of the Bellevue Hospital, New York, has very in- "euiously applied the plaster of Paris bandage to the treatment of caries of the spine with angular cm’vatmc, and to some of the more severe foirns -of lateral curvature. The following is a brief summary of the details of this method of treatment. The shirt being removed, a thin, closely woven vest without armlets is put •on next the skill; and a large pad is placed over the abdomen under the vest. The child then standing under a tripod stand, to the apex of which is attached a block-and-fall arrangement carrying a horizontal iron bar, a padded collar is buckled round the head and chin, while padded stirrups are passed under the ai'uis ; straps are then passed separately from the collar and arm-stirrups to the iron bar above. By adjusting these straps, the relative tension upon the head and arms can be adjusted with nicety. The indication that the proper amount of extension has been made with the pulleys, is the comfort ex- perienced by the patient. When thus suspended, the spine becomes much straighter ; the ears are hfted from the shoulders, and the diseased surfaces of the vertebim are thus prevented from pressing upon one another. The patient is now directed to take a few deep inspirations. Plaster of Paris bandages are carefully applied round the body from the pelvis to the arms ; and strips of thin perforated tin are placed by the sides of the spine, and a second layer of plaster bandages passed round the whole. The straps being now removed, the child is laid upon a mattress. As soon as the case is dry, the abdominal pad is withdrawn ; and the patient, when erect, is foiuid to be one to one-and- a-half inch taller. In cases of caries of the cerHcal region, a head-piece is adjusted to the body-case, by means of which the spine may be relieved of the weight of the head. After two or three months, the case may be slit down the fr’ont and fastened -with eyelets. After such treatment, it is commonly seen that respiration becomes easy and the circulation free, while symptoms due to in-itation of nerves subside. Dr. Sayre strongly insists on the im- portance of praetical details, such as the use of loose-textured bandages and suitable plaster, a closely fitting elastic shirt, and, above all, securing a perfect adaptation of the case. Fiu'ther details as to Dr. Sayre’s practice will be found in his Orihopmdic Surcjenj, 187(! ; the Richmond cmd Loui&viUe Mccliccd Journal, May, 1877 ; and the American Praciitioner. The ess6ntial points in this treatment, are 1st: Extension of the spine by suspension, und 2nd : Fixing the spine when so extended in a firm and light casing.EEEiVTA. 188, line 14, for “incision” read “excision.” 601, headline, for “Throat” read “Breast.” 733, line 6 from bottom, for “cellutitis” read “cellulitis. ,, line 17, for “off” read “of.” ,, line 18, for “Kinfe” read “Knife.” 775, line 13 from bottom, for “on” read “one.” 873, line 26, omit comma after “to.”'INDEX TO VOLUME II Abdomen, tapi)iug the, 696 Abilominal aorta. <S'cc Aorta. pariotes, changes of in hernia, 613 tumours, diagnosis from aneurism, 137 Aberncthy’s method of tying the external iliac artery, 140 Abscess {abscedo, I go away) diagnosis from aneurism, 29 Absces.s of antrum, 474 of areola, 578 in axilla, diagnosis from aneurism, 119 of bone, chronic, 170 necrotic, 178 breast, 578 chronic, 580 bursa patellce, 339 donsfil, 296 in frontal siiiuses, 398 groin, causes of, 297 diagnosis from aneurism, 139, 298 from hernia, 298, 659 from j)soas abscess, 297 of gums, 469 in hip-disease, 310 acetabular, 315 .

122 HPECTAL ANEURISMS. ticular case to be sitnatcci in the-neck. It is not uncommon to find it pul- satinj;' so high in the neck, that no amount of elevation of the clavicle by a subjacent axillary aneurism could raise that bone above the level of the vessel. In the majority of cases, ho^Yevcr, (in seventeen out of twenty-five, as shoAvn by Quain in his Avork on the Arterks,) it is cither beloAv the level of the bone, or but slightly raised above it; so that, if the clavicle were thrust upAvards and fonvards, the vessel would be bimied in a deep pit behind it. Dupuy- tren Avas of opinion that the artery coiu’scd high in persons Avho AA^ere thin, Avith slender long necks; Avhereas, in thick, short-necked persons, with muscular shoulders, it Avas deeply seated. I have often verified the truth of this observation, both in dissection and in examining the pulsations of the vessel durino- life. o In order to obviate the difficulty that has occasionally been experienced in reaching the artery when thus biu’ied behind an elevated clavicle, it has been proposed by Hargrave to saw through the bone. The most serious objection Fig. 3S7.—Ligature of the Suhclavian in the Third Part of its Course. that can be raised against this practice, is the fact of the clavicle being sometimes a part of the wall of the aneurism ; but, supposing the Sm-gcon could satisfy himself that this was not the case, I cannot sec any objection to this procedure, provided any very great and insurmountable difficulty presented itself in passing the ligature round the vessel without it.

345 TUMOURS OF MUSCLE. these ai-e said to have been cancerous IG were “fibrous;” 8 cystic; 5 hydatid ; and 5 erectile. In all probabilitj'-, a more advanced pathology would liave shown that many of the so-called cancerous and fibrous tumours were in reality sarcomata of various kinds. The form of cancer that occurs primarily in muscles is, I believe, invariably the encephaloid. I have most frequently seen the muscles of the lower extremity the seat of primary malignant disease. When the upper limbs arc affected, the muscles that have, according to Teevan, been most frequently attacked are the pectoralis major, deltoid, and biceps. The muscles of the trunk and neck are seldom diseased, Avith the exception of the rectus abdominis, Avhich appears to be very liable to tumours. Of twelve consecutive cases that I have had under my care in which timiours of different kinds dcA'eloped primarily in muscular tissue, the foUoving are the pai-ticulars. The first case Avas that of a woman about 48 years of age, in Avhom a fibro-cystic tumour, as large as a cocoa-nut, developed in connection Avith the tensor A'aginte femoris, forming a large mass, AA'^hich I dissected out Fig. u04.—Fibro-Plastic Tumour of tlie Sartorius AfustTe.

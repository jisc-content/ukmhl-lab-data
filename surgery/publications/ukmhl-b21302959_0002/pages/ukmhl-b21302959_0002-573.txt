USE OF THE LARYNGOSCOPE. 545 then introduces it in the following way. The handle being held like a pen, and rather to the left side of the patient’s mouth, the mirror is passed in care- fully, having its snrftxce parallel to the dorsum of the tongue, until the tip of the" uvula rests on its back, and is pushed slightly backwards and upwards by it. Caro must be taken, in doing this, that the reflecting surface does not touch the tongue, and so become dirtied, and that the miiTor is not passed so Fig. C41.—Ai)i)lioatioii of the Laryngoscope. The tongue should be di-iiwn forwards. j far as to touch the back of the pharynx, which in most patients would cause a an effort at swallowing. The miiTor being in the position above described, the ) Surgeon -will, if he see anything, Aiew the back of the pharynx reflected on its ^ surface ; but, by gently and steadily raising his hand, so as to render the angle & formed by the surface of the mirror with the patient’s body about half a right angle, he will bring the opening of the glottis into view. By raising the hand still a little further, he can examine the epiglottis and the root of the tongue. It must be remembered that the image thus produced is reversed in the antero- posterior direction, the parts that appear antei’ior on the mirror being really posterior ; while in the transverse direction there is no reversal. hen the Surgeon requires both hands, as in the application of caustics or in the removal of gi’owths or foreign bodies, the patient must be made to hold liis own tongue, or it must be held by an assistant. The Surgeon then holds the mirror in his left hand, and the instrument he is using in the throat m his right. Sometimes all view of the larynx is obscured by the patient obstinately arching the tongue in the mouth. It must then be hold down bv VOL. II. J N N

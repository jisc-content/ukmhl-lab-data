57° OPERATIONS ON THE AIR-TUBE AND CHEST. is slipped OA'er the upper margin of the sixth rib into the middle of the fifth intercostal space, and thrust sharply and firmly into the pleural sac, so as to make siu'e of penetrating the thickened pleura and any layers of false membrane which, if the instrument were pushed slowly on, might he thrust before it (Fig. G58). If the “ piston-trochar ” (Fig. 057) be used, the tap should be closed as the stylet is withdrawn, and an India-rubber tube attached to the end of the cannula. The tap being then opened, the fluid flows along this into a jar containing water. Or the Suction-trocliar may be used (Fig. 058), the chest fluid being allowed to rmi off by the elastic tube, the end of which is immersed in water. A third method of tapping the chest is by means of the Aspirator (Fig. 050). The air having been exhausted from the bottle and the stop-cock closed, the fig. 059.—Taijping the Chest hy the Asiiirator. chest is tapped in the usual situation with the aspirator-troohar ; and tie coo • on its side being turned on, the fluid rushes into the exhausted bottle to flU up the vacuum.

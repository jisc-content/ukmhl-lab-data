DISEASES OF THE GUMS AND ALVEOLAR PROCESSES. 469 CHAPTER LVII. DISEASES OF THE JAWS AND THEIE APPENDAGES. DISEASES OP THE GUMS AND ALVEOLAR PROCESSES. Abscess of the Gums is of veiy frequent occiuTence, from the irritation of decayed teeth. Here a free and early incision should be made ; which, by giving exit to the pus, wiU afford immediate relief. Spongy and Sloughy Ulceration of the Gums wiU occiu’ as the result of constitutional cachexy induced in any way—by mercury, malaria, syphilis, &c. It is best treated by tonics, in conjunction with the chlorate of potass and mineral acids internally. If it spread actively, escharotics, such as hydi’o- chloric acid or creasote, may be advantageously applied. If it do not make much progTess, a solution of nitrate of silver, uith chlorinated or tannin gargles, will be useful. Simple Hypertrophy of the Gums, in the fonn of a pendulous fr’inged outgTOwth overlapiring the teeth in back and front, is occasionally met with in yoimg children. Such a growth requires to be freely removed with scalpel or scissors. In a case of this kind under my care, it was found to consist of the ordinary structure of the gums, with a fine fibrous stroma con- taining much gland-tissue; the papilljB on ,'the surface were very large, and covered by unusually thick epithe- lium.

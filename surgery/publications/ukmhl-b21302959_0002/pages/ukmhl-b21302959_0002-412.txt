DISEASES OF THE HEAD AND NECK. 384 DISEASES OF KEGIONS. CHAPTER LV. DISEASES OF THE HEAD AHD NECK. DISEASES OP THE SCALP AND SKULL. The Scalp is subject to all those surgical diseases that affect the common integument of the body. But it is more than any other part of the surface liable to two diseases, viz., Atheromatous and Nmvus Tumour. These have already been so fuUy treated of in Volume I. (Atheroma, p. 737, and Nsevus, pp. 759 and 934) that their description here would lead to needless repetition. There is one form of disease pecuhar to the scalp which has not yet been mentioned, viz., the Pachydermatous Tumoiu*. Pachydermatous Tumour of the Scalp.—This disease, of extremely rare occurrence, was first described by John Bell. It was first named and fully described by Valentine Mott as Pachyclermatocdc, more recently by Virchow as Fibroma Malluscum. The accompanying cut (Fig. 545), taken from a patient whilst in America, who was aftenvards successfully oper- ated on by W. Stokes, in Dubhn, gives a good representation of the disease. These tumoui’s are neither painful nor dangerous, but their weight and the deformity oc- casioned by them render their removal desirable. Treatment.—The removal of this tiuuoiu may be effected by Fig. 545.—Padiydurmatoiis Tumour of Scalp. ligature 01’ the knife. Pollock has successfully extirpated one by the former, W. Stokes by the latter method. But the operation is not ivithout danger. In Stokes’s case the htcmorrhage was described as tenific, and had to be aivested by the cauteiy, nearly costing the patient his life. Stokes states that in the whole course of his experience he had never seen such copious and uncontrollable “ weeping ” hannorrhage ; it came from every point of the cut surface.

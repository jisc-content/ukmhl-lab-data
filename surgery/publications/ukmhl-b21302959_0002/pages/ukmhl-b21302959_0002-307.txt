279 EXCISION OF OS CALC IS. cletacliccl. By this operation the sole of the foot is somewhat extensively incised, and cicatrices are left over the heel. In order to avoid this inconvenience, I have found that disarticulation of the os calcis may readily be performed in the following way. The patient lying on his face, a horseshoe incision is carried from a little in front of the calcaneo- cuboid articulation round the heel, along the sides of the foot, to a correspond- ing point on the opposite side. The elliptic flap thus formed is dissected up, the knife being caiTied close to the bone, and the whole under surface of the os calcis thus exposed. A perpendicular incision, about two inches in length, is then made behind the heel, through the tendo Achillis, in the mid-line and into the horizontal one. The tendon is then detached ft-om its insertion and the two lateral flaps are dissected uj), the knife being kept close to the bones, from which the soft parts are well cleared (Fig. 40G). The blade is then carried over the upper and posterior part of the os calcis, the articulation is opened, the interosseous ligaments are divided, and then, by a few touches with the point, the bone is detached fiâ€™om its connections with the cuboid. This bone, together with the astragalus, must then be examined ; and if any disease be met with, the gouge should be applied. Should ankylosis have taken place lietyeen the os calcis and the astragalus, as I have found in one case, the bones

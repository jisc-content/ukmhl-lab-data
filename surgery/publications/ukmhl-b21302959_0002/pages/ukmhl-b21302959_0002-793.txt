The fasciculated, roughened, and sacculated condition of the Madder may generally be detected by the Avay in which the beak of the instrument gTates and rubs over the organ. The size of the calculus is best determined by a lithotrite. It is true that a Surgeon may sometimes come to a decision as to the bulk of a calculus, by observing the extent of surface along which the sound is in contact with the stone, as the instrument is being withdrawn. But a very rough guess only can be aiTived at in this way ; and I have frequently seen very experienced Sur- geons deceived in their estimate of the size of a calculus, mistaking perhaps several small ones lying together for one large one. By introducing a litho- trite and seizing the calculus gently between its blades, a correct estimate of its size may always be arrived at. In order to determine that severed calculi exist in the bladder, it is sometimes sufficient for the Surgeon to feel that the beak of the sound comes into contact with a stone on each side of the organ, or that it ean be distinctly insinuated between two concretions. In some cases, however, these points cannot clearly be made out; and then the Surgeon, introducing a lithotrite and seizing the first calculus with which he meets, should hold this between the blades of the instrument, and whilst it is so fixed move it and the lithotrite from side to side ; when, if a elick be heard and felt, he may be sm’e of the existence of another stone. Sounding is by no means destitute of danger, more especially if roughly done, or in patients who have chronic kidney-disease. In the first case it may

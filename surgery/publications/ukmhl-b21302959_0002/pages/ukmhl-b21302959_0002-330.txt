DISEASES OF THE SPINE. 302 it. The disease may suddenly terminate fatally by luxation of the vertebra) forwards, compression of the cord, and sudden asphyxia; or more slowly by hectic and gradual interference with the respiratory functions. The Treatment innst be conducted on precisely the same principles as that of angular curvatiu’e, by absolute rest, coimter-iiTitation, in the early stage, and tonics. As great and immediate danger may result from the sudden displacement of the vertebim, and the consecpient compression of the cciwical cord, the head usually requires to be steadied by proper apparatus calculated to support it and limit its movements, such as is represented in Fig. 25-1, ■s'ol. I., and the patient should be confined to the recumbent position. The paraplegia that accompanies severe forms of enenrvature of the spine AviU vary in degTee from impairment of motor power in the feet and legs to complete abolition of all sensation and motion in the loAver extremities. The feet, legs, and thighs will be utterly insensible to the electric stimulus both as regards muscular initability and cutaneous sensibility. But however marked the paraplegia, recovery need not be despaired of, provided the sphincters be not affected. I have seen cases of paraplegia from spinal caries, in which the electric sensibility and irritability were completely destroyed, and had been so for a year or two, recover both as to sensation and motion as the activity of the spinal mischief subsided under the influence of rest and appropriate treatment.

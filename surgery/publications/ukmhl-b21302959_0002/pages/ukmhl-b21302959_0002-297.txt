269 EXCISION OF THE KNEE-JOINT. Operation.—Excision of the knee-joint may be performed by making a horse-shoe incision with the convexity do^rawards, from the side of one condyle of the femnr across the tuberosity of the tibia to a coiTcspondmg point on the opposite condyle (Fig. 450). By this incision the ligamentum pa- telliB is divided, and that bone turned up in the elliptical flap ; the crucial ligaments, if not aheady disorganised, are then to be cut across, any remaining lateral attachments divided, and the bones cleai’cd for the saw. In doing this the limb must be forcibly flexed, and the knife carefiilly applied to the posterior part of the head of the tibia ; for this purpose a blunt-pointed re- section-knife is the best. The articular surfaces must now be SaAVn off This may be done by ^OO.—Elllptinal Tudsion in Exelsiou of the Knee-ioiut. Butcher’s saw, but in order to ensm-e a perfectly smooth section of the bones, many Surgeons prefer to use a common saw somewhat broader than that ordi- narily emifloyed in amputations. The lower end of the thigh-bone should first be removed, and then a slice taken off the tibia by cutting from behind forwards Fig. 4J7.—Application of Butcher’s S.aw to Head of Tibia.

(Fig. 457), the blade of the saw being turned horizontally ; care should be taken not to remove more bone than is absolutely necessary, lest the limb be too much shortened. It not unfrequeutly happens that carious cavities are found, extending IjcIow the level of the section that has been made ; when

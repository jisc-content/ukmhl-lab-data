CALCULUS. saloly be seized and crushed by means of a snnll nnri of 11 i i mi.o..,*ccps: o,if .fe ie fo of the shape of that depicted in Fig. 783. In prfoming hthotrity in the female it is not necessary to pulverise the calculus, but merely to break it up into fragments of such a size as to admit of easy extraction through the urethra. After the stone has been broken up, the urethra (unless this have previously been done) may be dilated by means of the two-bladed instrument to a mode- rate degi’ee, the larger fragments re- moved by means of a pair of slender forceps, and the detritus and smaller fragments cleared out of the bladder by repeated injections of tepid water. The whole of the fragments and detritus should be removed at one sitting. The shortness and wide capacity of the female urethra will readily allow the escape of any detritus that may un- avoidably be left. For all calculi in the female bladder, except those of the very largest size, this operation is the most applicable. I have in this way crushed and extracted at one sitting, fr’om the bladder of a lady about 50 years of age, a calculus (phosphatic) fully as large as a hen’s egg. By this operation the stone may be removed piecemeal and at once, without the necessity of dilating the m'ethra to such a degree as to incur the risk of incontinence of urine resulting. Lithotrity may be had recourse to at all ages, in^the very young as well as the old. I have crushed and successfully removed a large calculus from a child three and a half years of age, the youngest patient on whom I have operated by this method. Although the urethi’a of so young a female child cannot without danger of incontinence be dilated to too great an extent, yet it may safely and easily be enlarged sufficiently to admit a moderate-sized hthotrite.

SUBMENTAL EXCISION OF TONGUE. 525 recim-ence and increased activity of development. Slight enlargement of the glands under the jaw should not bo any bar to the operation, provided the disease be limited, and the constitution good. If much enlarged, the glands may be excised at the same time with the disease of the tongue ; or if they be not of veiy considerable size, they may be left, when they will perhaps subside without the necessity of operation, as their enlargement may probably be dependent upon simple imtation ; should they continue indurated, they may readily be removed at a subsequent period. Submental Operation for Excision of Tongue.—Regnoh of Pisa pub- lished, in 1838, a description of a method by which the whole tongue could be successfully removed. The plan that he proposed was as follows. An incision of a semilunar shape was made along the line of the lower jaw, beginning near one angle and terminating close to the other. A perpendicular incision was carried from the centre of this line immediately under the chin to the hyoid line Fig. 620.—Lines of Incision in Regnoli’s Operation. Fig. 630.—Tongue (Imwn out between Jaw and Hyoid Bone. (Fig. 029). in making this semilunar incision, care must be taken not to woimd the facial artery on either side. The trunk of the vessel should be protected by the finger of an assistant as it ounces round the lower jaw, and the incision should be confined within the space between the two facials. The triano-ular flaps of the skin formed in the manner indicated are dissected back, and the

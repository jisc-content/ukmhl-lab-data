OPERATION- FOR EXTROVERTED BLADDER. 841 of the two groin-flaps being in contact with the raw sui’facc of the reversed umbilical flap. The flaps arc then secured in position by hare-hp pins, each pin passed so as to transfix both the groin-flaps and a fold of the umbilical flap beneath, holding the three firmly together (Fig. 785). No sutures are required in the flaps. The edges of the wounds left in the places from which the flaps have been raised are then brought together by hare-lip pins and Avire sutures (Fig. 785), and broad strips of plaster placed across so as to support the parts and to remove as tar as possible any tension from the flaps. The patient must be kept in bed in a sitting posture, with the knees drawn up. If the operation be successful, all the pins and sutures may be removed by about the sixth or eighth day, and cicatrisation will probably be complete Fig. 780.

If a soft sarcoma, it may diffuse itself into areolar spaces and sheaths of muscles. The accompanying cuts (Figs. 429, 430) illustrate the microscopical ap- pearance presented by some forms of malignant tumour of bone. Situation.—Malignant tumour of bone most frequently occurs in tlic bead of the tibia and the lower end of the thigh-bone ; occasionally in tbe humerus and in tbe jaws, more especially about the antrum. It is a remarkable fact, long ago pointed out by Petit, and more recently insisted on by Ricbet, and which I have often Kg. 4:i;i.—Spiiidle- I'elled Snrootiia yf Shaft of Femur, buc- (•essfully Amputate<l at Hi]>-Joint.

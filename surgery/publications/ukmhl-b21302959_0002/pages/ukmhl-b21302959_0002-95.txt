ARTERIO-VENOUS ANEURISM. 67 This accident I have seen happen in one case in which 1 tried it, ljut no good resulted from this treatment, which cannot, indeed, on pathological gi-ounds, be considered to bo of a hopeful character. Meciiaxical 3IEAXS of various kinds have been nsed with the view of producing an artificial coagulum in the aneurism, and thus leading to its cure. Thus coils of horse-hair, cat-gut, or iron-wire have been thrust into and left in the sac, tlu’ough a punctiu’c made in it. It is scarcely necessary to say that such means of cure are as useless as they are unscientific. ABTEBIO-VENOUS ANEUBISM. Pretcraatural commiuiication between arteries and veins, though usually the result of wounds, occasionally happens from disease ; ulceration taking place between the vessels, and thus causing an aperture to lead fr’om one into the other. When such communications are of a traumatic character, they may, as has ah-eady been stated, constitute either an Aneurismal Varix or a Varicose Aneurism. As the result of disease, aneiu’ismal varix only can occur, varicose aneurism never happening except as a consequence of wound. These spon- taneous communications have been met mth between the aorta and the vena cava, and between the iliac, femoral, carotid, and subclavian arteries and their accompanying veins. In nature, symptoms, com*se, and treatment, they so closely resemble traumatic anemismal varix, described at page 317, vol. I., that their consideration need not detain us here.

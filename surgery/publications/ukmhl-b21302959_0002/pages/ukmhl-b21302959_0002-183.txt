LIGATUBE OF SUPERFICIAL FEMORAL ARTERY. 155 downwards in the axis of the limh, which, if continued, would fall a little to the inner side of the middle of the patella. The guide to the vessel is the Fig. 39S.—Ligature of tlie Superficial Feuioral Ai'terj'. inner border of the sartorius muscle. The point of selection for the applica- tion of the ligature is that where the sheath of the vessels is crossed by this muscle at the apex of Scarpa’s triangle. The operation is performed as follows (Kgs. 398, 390). An incision is made in the line above indicated, beginning two- and-a-half or three inches below Poupart’s ligament, and carried directly downwards for three-and-a-half or four inches. The sldii and superficial fascia having been divided, the fascia lata, which is here very thin, is exposed and opened to the same extent as the incision in the integuments ; the inner margin of the sartorius now comes into view, and im- mediately to the inner side of, and perhaps slightly overlapped by this, is the sheath of the vessels; this must now be cautiously opened, the long saphenous nerve being respected, and the aneurism-needle unarmed passed between the artery and vein, in close contact with the former from within outwards, at least four inches below Poupart’s ligament; it should then be threaded and withdrawn, and the ligature tied. The edges of the woimd must now be brought into contact by a couple of stitches and two strips of plaster ; the liml) being semi-flexed, somewhat raised, laid on its outer side, and wrapped in soft flannel or cotton wadding. The severe pain which is usually complained of about the knee after the tightening of the ligature may best be relieved by a full dose of opium. — A -M —-M Fig. 3!)9.—Uiiigi-.nii of Loft Suimrtioial Fomoral Artory at aiiex of Scar- pa’s Triangle.

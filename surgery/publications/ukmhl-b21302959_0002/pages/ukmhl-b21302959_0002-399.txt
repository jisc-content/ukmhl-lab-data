TREATMENT OP CONTRACTION OF THE KNEE. 371 •which flexion of the knee becomes an element towards the restoration of its utility. Instead of muscular action being arrested, and atrophy of the limb being thus produced, move- ment is conducive to the perfect action of the appai’atus ; so that the patient , experiences but little incon- venience from its use, aU the ordinary positions assimaed by the knee in walking, sitting, or standing being preserved. By this form of apparatus, then, three important points are secured : viz., replacement of the head of the tibia, exten- sion ot the angle of the leg, and tree muscular action diming the period of treatment. In Fig. 531, A and B are two levers, composed of metal, coiTesponding in their dfrection to the perpendicular position of the thigh-bone and tibia. C and D are two axes, placed exactly coincident -iidth the centres of the articular ends of the bones. E and F are two ^ ~ \ powerful springs, acting in ^^ opposing directions ; viz., in those indicated by the arrows in Fig. 530. Thus F presses the lever B in an anterior di- rection, bearing the end of the Id ^ ^ direction, bearing the the lual f As CandDare foimd acting above and below moTcs IwnmH, -i really offere a fixed resistance, and the tibia the anterior l A carrying the tibhivUrf fit i®)'l»'™''ards, joint. “‘'■a'vithit.and thus separating the osseous surfaces of the 2.

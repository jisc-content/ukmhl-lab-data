EXCISIO^'' OF THE IIIF-JOIXT. 327 liculth, find has continued so up to the present time, about fourteen years since the operation. In three other cases I have successfully removed large portions of the acetabulum and of the contiguous portions of the ilium and ischium. In cases such as these, the result, if they are left to themselves, must inevitably be fatal. There is no danger of laying open the pelvic cavity during the remo^-al of these masses of pelvic bone ; for, as Hancock has shovm, during the progi-ess of the disease the fasciae, muscles, &c., lining the pelvis, become so thickened and infiltrated with plastic matter, that they form a barrier which effectually protects the pelvic cavity. Method of Operating.—From the preceding considerations, it will be ob- served that there are two distinct operations practised on the coxo-femoral articulation. The first is simple resection of the epiphysis of the thigh-bone ; the second, the remoA’al of more or less of the acetabulum and of the con- tiguous pelvis bones as well. For the removal of the epiphysis of the thigh- l)one only, the foUovnng plan should be pursued. The patient Hes on the sound side.

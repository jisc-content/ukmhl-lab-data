INVAGINATION OF THE RECTUM. 737 an opiate pill administered, so as to an-est all peristaltic action for a fenâ€™ days. Should the ulcerated surhice show any difficulty in healing, it must he touched with the nitrate of silver. This operation always leaves a per- manent cure. The ligature of prolapsus, like that of internal piles, is not very painfu, and for it chlorofoim need not be administered ; indeed, it is, perhaps, better that it should not be given, as the protrusion is apt to slip up under its in- fluence, the patient not being able to exercise the proper expulsive efforts. Rut, as the excision of the external flaps and piles is attended by very sharj) suHering, it is as well to administer the anaesthetic at the time when they are being removed. Should a prolapsus become strangulated, it would be necessary to try to reduce it through the sphincter by the employment of the taxis ; if this caimot readily be accomplished, free incisions may be made into it; if it be not re- duced, it will slough away, and thus undergo permanent cure. Invagination of the Rectum occurs in some rare cases, and sometimes the portion that has descended through the anus has become strangulated. In such cases as these, reduction must be effected ; if possible without, but if necessary with, division of the sphincter. T have already referred (p. 689) to the occasional protrusion through the anus of a chronic intussusception carrying with it the ileo-cmcal valve, and the necessity of care in not confounding this "with a prolapsus of the mucous membrane. A remarkable case has been recorded by Stocks, of Salford, in which an anal protrusion of the size of a cocoa-nut contained an ovarian cyst. This was re- moved by an incision through the coats of the bowel; and, after the wound had healed, the bowel was returned. ? B VOL. II.

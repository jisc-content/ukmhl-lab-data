This clip is hinged, so that the lens contained by it can be turned aside when it is not required to be used. The mirror is held, as in the figure, to the right eye, to examine the right eye of the patient, and vice versd, with the handle horizontal, the little finger extended for the patient to look at, which if he does, then the observer (unless also the eye that is being examined be squinting) has in view the optic nerve-entrance in the fundus of the eye. And this is the best starting point, although the rest of the deeper parts of the eye remain to be examined. It is best to begin the use of the ophthalmoscope in the normal eye (the pupil dilated wth atropine) of a young person of fair com- plexion. First, a reddish glare is seen, and this is lighter at the optic nerve- entrance. Then, in order to perceive the details of the fundus, the lens, held in the free hand of the observer, is brought before the eye that is examined at a distance of a few inches, and moved all wjiys in the line of the reflected light of the fundus, until the best image is obtained. This hand may be steadied against the forehead of the patient. This mode of ophthalmoscopic examina- tion is the “ indirect” (inverted image). It is that usually employed. Some practice with the ophthalmoscope is necessary before proceeding to examine H H 2

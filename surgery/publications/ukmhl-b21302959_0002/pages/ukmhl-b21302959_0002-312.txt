Foot liefore Oiieration. 2. Foot six months after the Removal of the Malleolar Arch, hotli Malleoli, the Astragalus, and a portion of the Upper Surface of the Calcaneum. 4. If the disease have extended from the astragalus to the scaplmid, and thence ‘into the anterior range of tarsal joints, the foot will have become so exten- sively disorganised, that partial resection will be of little or no sernce ; and disarticulation at the ankle-joint should be practised. Excision of the Cuboid Bone, either in whole or in part, may be required. Partial excision is here done with the gouge. "Wlien the whole of the bone is taken away, the fifth metatarsal bone with thej little toe will probably also require removal. This may be done by making the fiap, as depicted in Fig. 41, vol. I., only commencing the incision about an inch further back, opposite the calcaneo-cuboid articulation, and opening this instead of the metatarso-cuboid. The Scaphoid Bone is very commonly the seat of primary disease ; and, as this bone is connected in front with the large tarsal synovial membrane, and posteriorly with that which is common to the calcaneo-astragaloid and astragalo-scaphoid articulations, the greater pai’t of the tarsus is apt to become speedily involved in the morbid action. It stands, indeed, next to the astra- galus in its power of implicating a great exteirt of the foot when diseased. The

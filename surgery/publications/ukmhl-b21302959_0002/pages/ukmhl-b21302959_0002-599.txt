One stop-cock c, as re])resentcd in the drawing (Fig. G()0), closes both tubes. The piston A being withdrawn, and a vacuum so produced, the cock c is turned so that it is parallel to the syringe, and the vacuum is thus put in connection with the needle n. While doing this, the small cock at e must be closed. If it be determined to use the ajjparatus as a syjjhon, the cock e must be opened, and the handle of the piston forced do^m so as to fill a long tube passing downwards from E.

573 TAPPING THE PERICARDIUM. the needle is to be inserted at the spot determined on. As soon as the open- ing at the point of the needle is covered, the stop-cock leading to it is to be opened, so that the vacuum extends into the needle ; and “we now advance, vacuum in hand, in search of the effusion.” The needle must be pushed slowly and carefully onwards in a direction upwards and inwards till the fluid appears in the glass tube of the aspirator. The moment this occurs aU movement of the needle must cease, and it must be held steadily as long as the fluid con- tinues to floAv. Any unnecessary movement may scratch and injure the surface of the heart. If the flow cease suddenly as if from some obstruction, a little fluid may be forced back as above stated to clear the needle. After AvithdraAving the needle no dressing is required to the minute puncture. Over a pint of fluid has been removed by this means at one operation. In inserting the needle, care must be taken not to force it through a costal cartilage, or a small plug of cartilage may be cut out Avhich would effectually close its canal.

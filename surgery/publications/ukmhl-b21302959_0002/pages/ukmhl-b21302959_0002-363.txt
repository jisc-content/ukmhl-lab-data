Maunder prefers a chisel to the saw in practising subcutaneous osteotomy of the neck of the femur, and has had much success in the operation so performed. On comparing this operation with those which had preceded it, by Barton, Sayre, and others, there can be no doubt of its superior simplicity and safety ; and although it is perhaps less likely to be followed by mobility of limb than when a piece of bone is cut out by Sayi'e’s method, yet it must be admitted that not only is a movable false joint of doubtful utility, but it seems to have been very difficult of establishment, so great is the tendency to bony ankylosis after these sections.

URINARY CALCULUS. Sl2 seized. In seizing the calculus, a good deal of tact is required. 'J'here arc two ways of seizing the stone. Brodie recommends that it should be done by pushing the female blade of the lithotrite against the inferior fundus of the bladder, pressing gently down with it so as to make a conical depression in <! this situation, and then inclining the beak towards the stone, drawing back ihe male blade with the thumb (Fig. 7G8) ; with a slight shake or jerk, the ■Surgeon then tries to get the calculus between the blades, at the same time •that the male branch is being pushed forwards to seize it. In this manceuvre the female blade should be moved as little as possible, but the stone must be seized by pressing the thumb upon the half-circle of steel fixed on the male branch. In this way the stone may often be seized at the first attempt, but in other cases it is not grasped until after several efforts have been made to fix it; the calculus, especially if round, slipping away from between the blades of the instrument, and being merely scraped liy them.

555 TUMOURS OF THE LARYNX. during life, nor treated effectually, have in recent yeai-s not only had their existence demonstrated by means of the laryngoscope, but have been removed by Walker of Peterborough, Gibb, G. Johnson, and Morell Mackenzie, in this, country, and by I\Ioura-Bourouillou of Paris, and other continental Surgeons. Gibb, in cases of this kind, succeeded in passing a loop of silver wire round the- bases of two such gi-owths, lying just within the true vocal cords, and then detaching them by draAving the Avires through a steel cannula, and so tighten- ing the loop. This ingenious operation has been performed several times Avith the aid of the laiyngoscope. Thyrotomy has been performed in some cases. This operation consists in opening the trachea and introducing a trachea-tube,, so as to enable the patient to breathe during the operation and during the after-procediu-c. The crico-thyroid membrane is then punctured, the thyroid cartilage slit up exactly in the median line, and the growth thus extracted by Avhat appears to bo and is a formidable operation, but Avhich has hitherto been attended by successful results. After the operation the parts are accurately brought together, and the irachea-tuhe is retained until the patient can breathe through the glottis Avith ease.

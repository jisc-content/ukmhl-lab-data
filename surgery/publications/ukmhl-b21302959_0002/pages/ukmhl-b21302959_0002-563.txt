REMOVAL OF THE TONSILS. 535 Toung children, but I’citlicr to iidopt <i coiu'sc of constitutional treatment nith the view to the impro^-ement of the general health, by means that are ordi- narily had recourse to in the management of struma. The internal use of iron, and the local application of the tincture of iodine, of nitrate of silver, or of burnt alum, are occasionally serviceable. In the majority of instances, however, the disease Avill not bo materially influenced by any therapeutic means that may be adopted : and as the enlargement, continuing or increasing, gives rise to difficulty in respiration, and thus interferes with the due arterialisation of the blood in the lungs, and impairs the child’s speech, it becomes necessary to remove that portion of the gTov'th which projects beyond the arches of the palate. This may best be done by the ordinary tonsil-guillotine. The ring of the instrument being passed over the tumour, the cutting blade is pushed forwai-ds, and thus a slice of the projecting part of the growth is removed. In some cases difficulty is experienced in bringing the tonsil fairly into the ring of the instriunent; this may be obviated by drawing it through with a vul- sellum or double hook, and indeed, in some of the machines sold for the pur- pose a double hook is attached, which, being flxed into the tonsil, draws it forwards before it is sliced off" (Figs. G3G, G37). In performing this operation it is best for the Surgeon to stand behind the patient, more particularly in excising the right tonsil, as he can thus look better into the mouth and have more counnand over the head ; or he may stand in front, and use the left hand for the right tonsil, and mce rersd (Fig. G38).

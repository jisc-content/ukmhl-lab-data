790 UlUNARY CALCULUS. bits of catheter, &c., from this organ, bad consequenees have rarely occurred, though the operations liavc often been tedious. In litliotoiny the case is different; for here the bladder is not only usually in a state of chronic irritation, but the kidneys arc frequently diseased, and these conditions influence the result of the operation more materially than any other circum- stances. Hence an operator may have a run of unsuccessful cases ; or, by a fortunate conciuTence of favourable cases, more particularly in childi-en, it has occasionally happened that a Surgeon has cut 20 or 30 patients in succession udthout losing a single one ; but several deaths then occun-ing, though the operation was performed in the same way and with the same care as before, his average has fallen to about the usual level. Green, at St. Thomas’s, cut 40 patients in succession, and only lost one. Tiynn cut 25 patients for stone without losing one, and he said that he thought he had at last discovered the secret of performing lithotomy with success ; but, he added, the Almighty punished him for his presumption, for he lost the next 4 cases that he cut. Bransby Cooper, of Guy’s, cut 30 patients in succession without a death, but then lost several, thus reducing the rate of mortality to the usual standard. Tn’ston, during a period of six years, in which he operated 24 times, lost no patient from lithotomy at University College Hospital; but out of the whole 37 cases which he cut during the period of his connection Avith that insti- tution, there were 5 deaths ; reducing the average to 1 in 7'2. This success Avas, however, very gi’eat when it is taken into consideration that most of these cases occuiTed in adults, and that many of them were of a very serious character. I And on reference to the Hospital Records, that only seven of the patients were under 10 years of age, whilst 14 were above 50 ; of these, two were 80 years of age, of whom 1 died and the other recovered. I beheve that Liston lost only one patient under GO years of age, and that was a lad of 18, in whom he found it necessary to diAude the right side of the prostate as well as the left, and who died of infiltration of urine. Thirty-eight patients, successively operated on at the NorAAoch Hospital, recovered, but the aA'erage rate of mortality in that Institution, calculated from 871 cases, has been 1 in 7*50. The accompanying Table gUes much valuable information on the rate of mortality after lateral lithotomy at different ages. It may be taken as a fair example of successful English practice in this operation.

347 TREATMENT OF MUSCULAR TUMOURS. I have seen two other cases of cnchondi’oma in muscles : one situated in the vastus extemus of the thigh ; the other in coimectiou with the pectoral muscle. The ninth case was a sarcoma of the rectus femoris in a man aged 21, which I excised ; the tenth, a cancerous growtli in the anterior abdominal wall in an elderly gentleman ; the eleventh, an encephaloid tumour of the muscles of the calf in a middle-aged lady, for which amputation was practised ; and the twelfth, a sarcoma of the fore-ai’m in a lad. Tumom-s developing primarily in the intermuscular areolar planes are of very common occurrence ; but these are very different from, and must not be confounded with, true tumours of muscle. The Treatment of these various muscular tumom-s must be considered on ordinai-y surgical principles. When of an innocent character, as cystic or hydatid, fibrous, erectile, or enchondromatous, they may be dissected out from the muscular tissue amongst which they he, and no fear of recm-rence need be entertained. When they are mahgnaut, amputation of the limb, if the tumour be favour- ably situated for such an operation, is generally the only resource : partial operations are imally worse than useless, as they lead to a speedy recurrence of the malignant action. Teevan has made the ingenious suggestion of applying to malignant tiunoins of muscle the same rule of practice that guides us in operations on bones affected by cancer ; viz., to remove the whole of the organ that is the seat of disease, excising the entire muscle from its origin to its insertion, and thus eliminating fi-om the system the whole of the morbid mass, which wih be confined within its sheath—a structure that for a long time resists the outward pressure of a morbid gTowth. This suggestion is foimded on con-ect pathological principles ; the only objection to it is its difficulty of application in actual practice—there being few muscles so situated that they could with safety be completely extirpated.

870 DISEASES OF THE PROSTATE. be regarded as a manifestation of a constitutional disease. It may lead to ex- tensive suppuration in the ischio-rectal fossa, and possibly to some forms of : fistula in ano. Cheesy masses are occasionally found in the prostate in cases ^ of tubercular disease of the epididymis, vesiculm seminales, and vas deferens. ' In a case which occurred lately in University College Hospital, in which the ' patient died of tuberculai- meningitis after castration for tubercular testicle, two cavities surroimded by cheesy matter, and lai-ge enough to admit the top J of the thumb, were found in the prostate gland. i Cysts or Cavities are sometimes found in the prostate; they may be | dilatations of gland-follicles, abscesses, or cavities containing concretions or > calculi. ] Prostatic Calculi have been abeady described in the Chapter on Urinary 1 Calculus (Vol. II. p. 833). | Prostatorrhcea has been described by Gross as a discharge of elear glairy 1 mucus from the prostate, in consequence of irritation of that organ. The disease is characterised by the discharge of a few drops of ropy, viscid mucus from the urethra after micturition or defecation. It is chiefly of importance from its hability to be confounded with spermatorrhoea, and from the depressing efifeet consequently produced upon the patientâ€™s mind. The Diagnosis of prostatorrhcea from simmatorflicoa may be effected by microscopical examination of the charaeters of the discharge. The Treatment consists in attention to the state of the general health ; the administration of tonics, more especially of iron and nux vomica ; the removal of any local source of initation in the urethra, rectum, or anus, as stricture, piles, or fissure ; and the local application to the prostatic portion of the urethra of the nitrate of silver. The application of a blister to the perinjeum j is beneficial in some cases. I

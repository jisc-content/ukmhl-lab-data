Should it be found that there m-e any enlarged glands in the axilla, they may be extii-pated either by extend- ino- the ivound upivards in this region, or by making a separate incision into the axilla, and carefully dissecting them out. In doing this, the edges and point of the scalpel should be very carefully used, and the glands rather teased iut by the handle of the knife and the fingers, so as to avoid the risk of hiemoiThage, which is apt to be troublesome in this situation, ihe extirpation ■of cnlai'gcd axillary glands is the most difficult part of operations on the Fig. GGO.—Incisions for Eeiuoviil of Cancer of Breast. breast, as they often extend much higher into the axilla and under the edge of the pectoral muscle than -would at first appear. When exposed, they may be ■seized with a double-hook or an artery-forceps, Avell di’awn down, and then enucleated as far as practicable with the fingers, aided by a few cautious touches with the edge of the knife. The less the point is used deep in the axilla, the better for the patient. Should the glandular mass extend high np, coming into close relation with the axillary vessels, it would be prudent not to attempt its complete extirpation -with the knife ; but, hawing been separated as far as practicable in the way already mentioned, it should be well drawn down, and then tightly tied as high as possible with a piece of whipcord, all that portion below the noose being then cut off. In this way we may avoid the two gi’cat dangers which attend extirpation of tumours in this locality, deeply situated and out of sight—^limmon’hage, and

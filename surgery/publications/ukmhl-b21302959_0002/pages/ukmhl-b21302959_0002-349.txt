321 TREATMENT OF FEMORAL COXALGIA. or the starched baiidagv. Of the two I prefer the starched bandage, as being more easily aj^plied, and forming a better fitting and more seciu-e casing to the limb. In applying it, the limb should be bandaged from the toes upwards, and Avell padded about the knee with cotton wadding, and the bandage should be can-ied in repeated turns round the hip and body in the form of a spica ; at the posterior part of the hip it should be strengthened with a piece of pasteboard lined with caheo, sufficiently long to extend down the whole of the back of the thigh to below the knee, so as to support that joint also. It is of much im- portance to do this, as otherwise the hip cannot be kept immovable. In apply- ing this, or any other appai’atus, in the more acute form of the disease, the patient inll commonly require to have chlorofonn administered, as the pain occasioned by the necessary movements would otherwise be too severe to be borne. After the starched bandage has well set, a trap may be cut in it opposite any part of the joint to which it may be thought necessary to make applications ; and the perineal aspect of the apparatus must be well lined and covered with oiled silk, so as to prevent its being injuriously soiled. In this way the hmb may be immovably fixed in a proper position by a light and firm apparatus, which will seldom require to be changed during the treatment of the case. A very ingenious and useful extending apparatus for hip-joint disease, at any period of its development, from the earliest to that of abscess, has been invented by Sayre (see Fig. 488). By means of this aouaratus. extensinn is maria Fig. 48S.—SajTo’s Extending Apparatus for Hip-joint Disease.

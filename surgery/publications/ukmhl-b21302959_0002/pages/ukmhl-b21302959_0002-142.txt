Haemorrhage from the carotid. Fig. 3S5.—Ligature of tlie Subclavian in tbc First Part ol its Coui-se. (Liston.) Thus it will be seen that, while this operation is bad in principle, it is most unfortunate in practice. This appaUing- Table needs no comment. It is, to my mind, conclusive as to the merits of the operation, the patient having, in every case but two, been earned off by secondary haimorrhage from the distal side of the ligature, in con- sequence of the close jiroximity of numerous collateral branches (Fig. 385); and in the two ex- ceptional cases the operation, although performed skilfully, proved fatal in one instance from periearditis and pleiu'isy, and in the other fr-om pyaemia, before the period at which secondary htemonhag-e might have been expected. Liston, in one case, hgatm-ed the root of the common carotid, as well as that of the subclavian, hoping in this way to diminish the risk of secondary hcemorrhage, by arresting the current of blood which, by sweeping into the carotid past the mouth of the sub- clavian, would necessarily wash away any coagulum that might be formed in this artery. But his expectations were not realised : htemorrhage took place as usual, and fr-om that portion of the artery which lay on the distal side of the ligatm-e, the blood having been carried into this end of the vessel in a retrograde coin-se, through the connection existing between the vessels arising fr-om it at this point, and Fig. 38G.—Ligature of the Subclavian aud Carotid for Subclavian Aneurism.

REMOVAL OF SEQUESTRUM. i8S is necessaiy is to make an incision down it through tlie soft parts, either by j directly cutting upon it or by slitting up sinuses with a probe-pointed bistoury, and then to remove it with a pair of forceps, or to tilt it off the bed of gTanu- lations on which it is lying, by introducing the end of an elevator beneath its edge. "When the necrosis is central, the sequestrum being imbedded in the new case, or covered in by old bone, the operative procedui'cs for its removal are of a more complicated character. The difficulties here consist in some cases in the depth from the surface, and in the obstacle offered by its passage through the soft parts ; and in others, in the length and magnitude of the sequestrum in proportion to the small size of the cloacm, and in the manner in which it lies in a pai’allel direction to these openings. In cutting down upon the bone, the Surgeon must be guided by the direction and the com’se of the fistulous tracks that lead to the principal apertm'es in the new case, the incisions being carried in the axis of the limb, and carefully directed away from large blood-vessels and nerves. In many instances, however, the htemorrhage is somewhat abun- Fig. 411. Fig. 414. Gouge-forceps. Fig. 415.—Straiglit Saw for removing Xecrosecl Bone.

15 TREATMENT OF ARTERIAL OCCLUSION. forms of the disease, there is a third and very common variety, in wliich a low form of inflammation takes place in previously diseased arteries, and in which we find a combination of the two conditions. Treatment.â€”With regard to the treatment of nan-owing or occlusion of the arteries, uncoimected with gangrene, I have little or nothing to say ; except that, if there be reason to suspect such occunence in a limb, care must be taken to keep the part wann by means of appropriate clothing, and if there be much pain, to allay this with ojnates. If gangTcno have come on, it must be treated with reference to its cause. That connected with arteritis and embolism has already been discussed (Vol. I., p. GG7) ; but when it occurs from structural disease of the coats of the vessel, then the treatment must be directed by the existence or aljsence of any complicating inflammation, in accordance with those principles that have been laid dorni in discussing the general manage- ment of gangi-ene.

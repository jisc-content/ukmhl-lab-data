ANEUlUS2f. 58 and a longer time was expended over it than is now generally the case ; and the example set by Murray, with regard to abdominal aneurism, has been followed with success in respect to the femoral, popliteal, and other Ibnns of the disease, the conipressor being screwed down tight on the artery so as com- pletely to arrest for the time all circulation through the sac, the patient kept under chloroform, and the cure elfected in a few hoiu’s. Applicability.—Of the great value of compression in the treatment of aneurism, there can be no doubt; more especially when the tumour is situated in the arteries of the loAver extremity below the middle of the thigh. In aneurisms occurring in the vicinity of the trunk, as in the iliac, the carotid, subclavian, and axillary arteries, it is generally not so applicable ; although, as we have already seen, aneurisms in the groin have been cured by compression of the abdominal aorta, or of the iliac artery. Spontaneous anemism is extremely rare in the upper extremity; and, as the traumatic forms of the disease which occur here generally require that the sac should be laid open, it is seldom found necessary to have recoiu'se to it in this part of the body, though it may be and has been successfully applied to the brachial artery. The gTeat question with regard to compression appears, after aU, to be whether it possesses any special advantages o^'er the ligature, in the treatment of those aneurisms in which its emj)loyment is practicable. The principal objections that have been urged against compression are, that its employment is moi’e painful and tedious than the use of the ligature ; and that those cases that are unpromising to the ligature, or that require amputation rather than deligation of the artery, are equally mifa's-oiuable to compression, and cannot be saved by its employment. To these objections it may with justice be answered, that the pain attendant on the employment of compression depends very greatly upon the skill and care with which the apparatus is applied and managed throughout, as well as upon the kind of instnunent used, being certainly much dimim’shed when Carte’s elastic compressor is employed ; and that, as has already been shown, the pain may be overcome by the use of aucEsthetics. With regard to the relative tediousness of the treatment under the two plans, it would aj>pear that in reality there is but little difference ; for although some cases, in which compression is used, are prolonged over a considerable space of time, yet they do not occupy more than is often consumed when accidents of "Naiious kinds follow the use of the ligature ; and it not nnfrequently happens in com- pression, but can never occm’ after the employment of the h'gature, that the patient is cured of his disease in a few hours or. days. Taking, however, the averages, Ave find that in the Dublin cases the treatment lasted twenty-five days, and in the London cases but nineteen, and this is not very different froin what happens Avith the ligature ; for, of 54 cases recorded by Crisp, iLich the femoral artery was tied, the average time for the separation ot in Av th UgatiiT™ to this a week more be a<MeA tor the closure of the wound, and for the treatment of the various accidents often accompanying and following ligature, we should pio a y ic wi in e mai,, and yet only bring the duration ot the treatment of the two methods to the “Tfto ali.

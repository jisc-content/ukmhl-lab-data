ACUTE BRONCIIOCELE. 411 tying them en masse. It is of the first importance that the vessels be tied ill and with their sheathing envelope; for, as AYatson truly observes, if this be not done, they will be found to be so ft-agile as to risk being cut through by the ligatures. After the ligature of the four sets of supplying vessels, the cellular capsule of the thyroid should be opened by being scratched through in the mesial line, and the mass removed Avith care and delicacy, all attachments being di\uded by blunt-pointed scissors. The principal danger, besides the lueuiorrhage, would probably consist in the adhesion of the tumoiu’ to the sheath of the vessels, more particularly the internal jugular vein. In one case referred to by ^Y. Greene, this vessel Avas AA'ounded. 4. Acute Bronchocele is a very different disease from the last. It is of rare occurrence, but has been met Avith both sporadically and epidemically. In this form of the affection the thyroid gland undergoes rapid enlargement,, attaining to the size of the fist or larger in the coiu’se of a feAV days or Aveeks. Both lobes and the isthmus become affected. Owing to the rapid enlargement of the thyroid body, the fascia of the neck covering it does not expand Avith sufficient rapidity; and the consequence is that the subjacent parts, as the- trachea and recmi'ent laiyngeal nerves, become compressed, so that respiration is seriously impeded, intense dyspnoea sets in, and death from asphyxia may result in the course of a fcAv Aveeks. It is difficult in these cases to hmoAV hoAV to save the patient; for tracheotomy is impracticable, OAAang to the mamier in which the tiunour dips down behind the sternum. In such cases, tapping the tmuour in different places, and the diAision of the fascia of the neck covering it, would give relief, and afford time for the action of remedies.

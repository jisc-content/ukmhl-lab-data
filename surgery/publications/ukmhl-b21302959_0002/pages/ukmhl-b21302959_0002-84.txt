ANEURISM. pressure on the coramon femoral artery, under chlorofoim, for twelve hours. y laese means the only serious objection to the employment of pressure, and almost the only cause of its ftxilure, may be prevented; and it is clear that, nnder chloroform, pressure may he applied to arteries, such as the subclavian and carotid, on xvhich it could not otherwise he used. The employment of a imgM may sometimes be advantageously substituted for the clamp, and often occasions less distress to the patient. For this puimosc the apparatus fFi<^s. JlGi)) will be found veiy useful. ° A very simple compressor is Tufhell’s compressor, represented in Figs. 370, Fig. 3V0.—Tufiiell’s Compressor. 371. It consists of little more than a truss-spring, with a pad to compress the artery, and straps to fix it in its place, and increase, by being tightened, the force of the compression. The Effects upon the tumour vary considerably. In some cases it rapidly and suddenly solidifies; more commonly, however, this is a gradual process, the aneurism becoming more jDainful and solid, with less pulsation and iiruit. As the solidification takes place, there is usually some restlessness, a feeling of general uneasiness, and of constitutional disturbance, which is best quieted by opiates. As the j>ressixre is continued, and the tumoin begins to harden, the anastomosing vessels enlarge, with a good deal of burning pain in the limb generally, and arterial pulsations in situations where usually none are felt. The abnormal pulsation, in these cases, is always found to occur in much the same situations, the same vessels aixpearing to midergo dilatation. Thus Tufnell has made a remark, Avhich I have had more than one opportunity of xerilying, that, in the treatment of j)opliteal anemism by compression, three

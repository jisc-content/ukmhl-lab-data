DEFORMITIES. 3^4 o. ihe third variety of deformity consists in the development of a smer numei-ary Jinger on the ulnar side of the hand, so as to constitute a small Ld deformed additional httle finger. All these varieties of deformity of the fingers. are more or less hereditary, and may veiy easily be removed by operation, which is simple and perfectly safe, the supernumerary finger being dis- articulated at its base. It is better to do this at as early an age as possible : no good can possibly come of delay. 4. There is a rare variety of con- genital deformity of the hand and fingers, in which the fingers are supernumerary, in consequence of a dee]} bifurcation of the hand. 5. In some rai’e cases, as in that from which the annexed draiving (Fig. 523) was taken, two hands appear to be fused into one. In these cases, no opera- tion can be advantageously practised. Besides these, various other kinds of congenital defomiity of the fingers are met with. One or more fingers may be pretematiu-ally long, or abnormally short, thick, or atrophied ; or one finger may be entirely absent. The accompanying drawings (Figs. 524 and 525) are coiTect representations of a remarkable deformity of the hand in a child that was imder my care some Fig. 522.—Supenuiineraiy Tliiuub. Fig. 523.—Appaaeut iMsion of Hauds. years ago. The fingers appear to have suffered in some instances complete, in others partial, amputation in utcro. They arc marked by deep transverse sulci; others are shortened, and terminate in rounded nodules, with a narrow pedicle connecting them with the proximal phalanx. Webbing of the Fingers is occasionally met with. In this condition a cutaneous septum unites all the contiguous fingers. Sometimes the malforma- tion is confined to one digital interspace, and then it is usually that between the index and middle fingers. In other cases it occupies two or all three in- terspaces. The web is a tolerably thick septum of skin, narrow at the base,

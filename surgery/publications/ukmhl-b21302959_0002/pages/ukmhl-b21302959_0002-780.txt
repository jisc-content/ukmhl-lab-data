The urine is liable to the deposit of various solid matters, which, when- amorphous and impalpahlc, are termed Sediments ; when ciystalline, they constitute Gravel; and when concrete. Calculus or Stone. These deposits, whatever form they assume, are the result of constitutional causes ; and the constitutional conditions giving rise to them are commonly called Diatheses. Of these, Siugcons usually recognise three ; the Uric or LitMc, the Oxalic, and the Phosphatic; besides, these,'however, others doubtless exist, the precise characters of which have yet to be determined. Uric or Lithic Acid Diathesis.—This diathesis chiefly occurs in in- dividuals of robust habit of body and florid appearance, Avho have lived high, and suffer from irritable gastric dyspepsia. It is often associated with a gouty or rheumatic tendency, or Avith some of the more chronic forms of skin disease, especially psoriasis. It is characterised by scanty and acid high-coloured urine, which deposits on cooling two kinds of sediment, a yellow and a red. According: to Lehmann, these sediments consist of urate of soda : but Golding Bird, and, I belieA-e, most of the chemists in this country, regard them as urate or lithatc- of ammonia. But AY. Eoberts states that they have no definite chemical com- position, consisting of uric acid combined A\ith soda, potass, and ammonia, in varyino- proportions. The yellow sediment, containing an admixture of the , colouring matter of the urine, is usually dependent on slight disorder of the digestive organs and skin, coming and going under the influence of very trivial causes. The red sediment, owing its colour, according to Bird, to an : admixture of purpurine, a highly carbonaceous ingredient, and indicat^e of imperfect assimilation, is met with in persons of full habit, who hve too ^eely.

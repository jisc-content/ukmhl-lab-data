346 DISEASES OF SYNOVIAL MEMBRANES, AND OF MUSCLES. sheatli of and in the substance of the sartorius muscle of the left thigh, in consequence of a strain. After growing slowly for about six years, it had attained the size of a child’s head, when I removed it, together with seven or eight inches of the muscle from the inside of the sheath of which it had originated, and with which it was closely incoqDorated. The sheath of the femoral vessels, which was exposed for a considerable extent, was unaffected by the disease. RccuiTence took place in less than twelve months in the cicatrix, and Avhen the secondary tnmoiu’ had attained the size of an ostrich’s egg, it was removed, the patient making a good recovery ; but the disease again returned, and eventually proved fatal. The fourth case was that of a man aged about forty, in the sole of whose foot a cystic tumour, about as large as a goose’s egg, was developed, springing from the flexor brevis digitorum. This was carefully dissected out; but in a few months the patient returned, with a sohd, elastic, rapidly growing tumoiu*, evidently malignant, developed in the cicatrix (Fig. 507) . The foot was amputated, and on dissection the mass proved to be ence- phaloid, and to have developed from the muscular structm-e just named (Fig, 508) . Pig. 507.—Malignant Tumour in Sole. Fig. 50S.—Section of Foot showing situation of Timiour. Ill three cases the tumours were hydatid. In one patient, a young woman, the disease was seated in the deltoid; in the other, a medical man, about 50 years of age, the tumour was seated at the outer edge of the latissimiis dorsi; and the tMrd was a gentleman about 60 years old, in whose biceps the disease commenced. In each of these cases, excision of the tumoiu' was successfully practised. In the eighth case, the tumour was an enchondroma in the tibialis anticus.

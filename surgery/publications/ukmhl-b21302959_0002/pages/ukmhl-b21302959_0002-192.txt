164 SPECIAL ANEURISMS. the leg, except for injury. The difficulties of the operation are lessened as the ankle is approached, where the artery becomes superficial, and may easily be secured. The line of direction of the anterior tibial artery is from the inner side of the head of the fibula to a point exactly midway between the two malleoli; and the course of the dorsal artery of the foot is fr’om this point to the cleft between the first two toes. In the upper third of the leg the artery lies deeply between the tibialis aartiens and exteaisor communis digitorum muscles, surrounded by veins, and having its nerve to the outside. If it be ever found necessary to tie it in this situation, the incision requisite to expose it should be made at least four or five inches in length ; and especial care should be taken not to cut into the muscular substance, but to open the fii’st intermuscular space to the outside of the tibia, at the bottom of which the vessel will be found. In the middle third of the leg, the artery will be found between the tibialis anticus and the extensor proprius poUicis ; it is best reached here by keeping well to the outside of the tibialis anticus. The Arteria Dorsalis Pedis may be felt pulsating, and may readily be secured, as it runs forward ft'om the ankle-joint to reach the space between the first and second metatarsal bones, lying between the tendon of the extensor pollicis and that of the extensor brevis digitorum, by the inner tendon of which it is crossed at its lower part.

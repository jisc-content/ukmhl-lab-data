After complete solidification of the tumom* has taken place, the compression ought to be continued for at least forty-eight hom’s, so as to secure against the occiuTence of a relapse. The Duration of the Treatment varies very greatly. In some cases, as above stated, the tumour has become solidified in a few hoiu’s or in two or three days. In other instances, the treatment has required to be protracted for more than three months before a cime has resulted. Of 2C cases of femoral or popliteal aneurism cured by compression in the London hospitals, the average time, according to Hutchinson, was nineteen days. Much of course will depend, in this respect, on the constitution of the patient, and on the condition of the tumour ; those circumstances which are most fa^'ourable to the spontaneous cure of the aneurism will also influence the rapidity of the cure by compression. There are, undoubtedly, certain conditions of the blood in Avhich it is little disposed to coagulate, and in these cases the duration of the treatment will necessarily be prolonged. So, also, when the aneinlsm is tiibular, we must expect that the blood Avhich passes freely through it in the direct current of the circulation will be slower in undergoing those changes that lead to its consolidation than when the disease is sacculated, and thus contains a residuum of blood that is not so directly influenced by the current through the sac. In the early days of the compression treatment, there was an indisposition on the part of Surgeons to apply it very effectually and firmly.

933 CIRCUMCISION FOR DISEASE OF PREPUCE. jnsfc in front of that structure. He then seizes the projecting prepuce imme- diately in front of the glans with a pair of narrow-bladed polypus forceps, which he gives to an assistant, who must hold them tightly; or he grasps it and protects the glans by means of a plate (Fig. 829), which I have had constructed for this pmpose. With one sweep of the bistomy he cuts off all that portion of the integument which projects beyond the for- ceps, which are then taken away (Fig. 830). It will now bo found that ho has only removed a circle of skin, but that the mucous membrane lining it still tightly embraces the glans ; this he slits up, by introducing the point of a pair of scissors at the preputial orifice ; and then, trimming off the angles of the flaps of mucous membrane, and if ne- cessary snipping across the fraenum, he tm-ns back the mucous membrane, and attaches it to the edge of the cutaneous incision by five points of metalhc suture, two on each side and one at the fr£enum. Before introducing these, he will generally find it necessary to ligature a small Fig. 829.—Insti-umoiit for iiolcling tlie Pre- puce in Circiun- cisiou. artery on each side of the penis, and one or two in the fi’^num.

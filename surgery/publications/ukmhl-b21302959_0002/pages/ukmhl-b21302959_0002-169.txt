LIGATURE OF EXTERNAL ILIAC ARIERl. 141 but if done in the my u-liich I have dosovibed, and at the lower angle of the may bo safely accomplished. The artery may now be felt pulsating Tig. 395.—Ligature of the Extenial Iliac by Abemethy’s Operation, modified. at the bottom of the -woniid, coyered by a thin fascia and having the vein lying to its inner side, and somewhat behind it. The investing areolar tissue must be scratched through, and the needle passed from the inner side between the vessels, the ligature being then tied in the usual way. In Sir A. Cooper's operation, an incision about three inches in length is made a little above and nearly parallel to Poupart’s ligament, begimiing above the inner margin of the external abdominal ring, and ending neai- the anterior superior spine of the ilium. By this incision the tendon of the external oblique is exposed, and must be divided to the full extent of the external wound, when the spermatic cord will be seen passing under the lower edge of the internal oblique and transversalis muscles. Some loose ai'eolar tissue and fascia have now to be scratched through ; and the finger, being passed under the cord, will come into contact with the external iliac artery, close to the spot where the epigastric is given off from it; the upper side of the incision must now be well raised by a copper spatula, when the vessel Avill be exposed, covered by an areolar sheath and having the vein to its inner side ; the sheath must be cau- tiously opened, and the ligature passed fr’om within outwards. On comparing the two operations, it would appear that the principal dis- advantage of Abemethy’s is, that it is apt to leaA’e a tendency to hernial pro- trasion, in consequence of the abdominal wall being much weakened by the

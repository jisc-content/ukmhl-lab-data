979 SPECULUM VAGIN Ml. CHAPTER LXXV. DISEASES OF THE FEMALE GENITAL ORGANS. SOMK of the more important surgical affections of these organs, such as vagino- vesical and recto-vaginal fistulm, lacerated perinmum, &c., have already been discussed. The remaining affections, implicating the Vagina, the Uterus, and the Ovaries, are of considerable practical interest ; but, as their full con- sideration Avould lead me far beyond the limits that can be assigned to them in this -work, and, indeed, belongs to another department of Medicine, I must content myself with a brief indication of the principal surgical points deserving attention. INTRODUCTION OF INSTRUMENTS. SPECULmE VAGmiB.â€”Vaginal specula of various shapes and materials are commonly used by Surgeons. When the os and cervix of the uterus require exploration, the most convenient instrument is certainly the cylindrical reflecting glass speculum (Fig. 857); which, being coated with a layer of Fig. 808.-Br.mched Spoouluin. Fig. 859.-Bivalve Speculum. tmfod, covered by India-rubber, always presents internally a mirror-like surface, by Avluch a strong body of light is thrown into the bottom of the tube. 3 R 2

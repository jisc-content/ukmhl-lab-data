XI TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE. I have also to thank many kind friends who have furnished me with information which has been of great use to me, and which I could not otherwise have obtained. But to none am I more deeply indebted than to my able and excellent friend James Dixon, Surgeon to the London Ophthalmic Hospital, and lately Demonstrator of Anatomy in St. Thomas’s School, for his ready and constant assistance during tlie whole course of this work; and it is with much pleasure that I take this opportunity of offering my testimony to his high pro- fessional talent and private worth. Before I conclude, it is but justice to my Publisher to acknow- ledge his liberality in allowing me entirely to control and conduct this work, according to my own views, no less than his readiness in undertaking, solely on my recommendation, the publication of a book, which, although well known and estimated abroad, was almost new to English Surgeons, and could only be brought out, in the manner I desired, at considerable risk and expense. To him, there- fore, is due in part the appearance of this eighth translation of Chelius’s Handbook, since without his assistance it would probably have never seen the light. I know not whether to consider it a matter of gratulation, that a reprint of my translation has been begun at Philadelphia. Nine numbers have already appeared, without any communication having been made with my publisher, although he had offered to furnish an edition for the American market before the forms were broken up. I must at least feel gratified that my Author’s celebrity has reached to the western hemisphere : it will be extended to India, in a way more satisfactory to my publisher, through the munificence of the Directors of the Honourable East India Company.

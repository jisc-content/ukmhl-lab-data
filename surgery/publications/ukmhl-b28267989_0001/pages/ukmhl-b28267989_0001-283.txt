Under the terms Erysipelas, St. Anthony's Fire, {Rosa, Erysipelas, Lat.; Rose oder Rothlauf, Germ.; Erysip'ele, Fr.,) is usually understood an inflammation of the lymphatic vascular network overspreading the sur- face of the cutis, in which, not unfrequently, the skin, glands, and Mal- pighian mucous net, but more rarely the cellular tissue and muscles lying beneath, partiticipate. Under this general notion are included a number of diseased conditions which are considered as modifications of erysipelas, but in their nature are entirely different from it. Rust has the merit of having pointed out their special points of difference, and recognises a True Erysipelas (Erysipelas verum seu exanihematicum, Lat.; dote i2o5e,Germ.) and a False Erysipelas (Erysipelas spurium seu Pseudo-Erysipelas, Lat.; undchte Rose, Germ.) _ [Hunter long since observed, that “ most inflammations that are not of the true adhe- sive and suppurative kinds are called erysipelatous, although, probably, they do not in the least belong to it.” (p. 269.) And Chelius has echoed him in the above observation, that “ a number of diseased conditions, which are considered as modifications of erysipelas’ in their nature are entirely difierent from it.” But he has not at all, by his arrange- ment, mended the matter, and I have, therefore, pointed out, first, the difierent applica- tions of the terms erysipelas and erythema, which are employed by him very contrarilv to our ordinary usage of them; and, afterwards, I have shown that one of his forms of erythema is really that important disease, inflammation of the cellular tissue which bv other writers as well as by him, is confounded with inflammation of the skin, and often mentioned as pngrenous ei^sipete. It is, howper, right to observe that our author has, at the end of paragraph 8^ shown that he is not unaware of the impropriety of considering this disease as an afiecUon of the skin.—J. F.

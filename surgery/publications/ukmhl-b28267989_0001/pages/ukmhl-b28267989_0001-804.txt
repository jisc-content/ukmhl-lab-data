With this local treatment must be connected internal treatment pro. portioned to the state of the patient. In -vt'eakness and want of tone strengthening remedies must be used ; if there be stoppage of tlie bowels which is very often connected witli ulcers on the lower extremities, purga^ tive and gently strengthening remedies with a regulated diet must Ije employed. The gratiola in suitable doses is advi.sable in these cases, as well also as when there is no stoppage in the bowels, but a general slug- gishness and phlegmatic habit. 764. Relapses after the healing of atonic ulcers are very frequent, espe- dally if the occasional causes be not diminished. They usually break out in autumn or in winter. The best mode of preventing them is perseverance in moderate compression of the foot by a laced stocking of unyielding leather; at the same time a proper diet is to be observal, and every violent motion of the foot to be avoided.

Scorbutic Ulcers (^Ulcera scorbutica, IjdX. \ scorbutischen Gesch- wicre, Germ. ; Ulceres scorbutiques, Fr.) are always indications of more or less developed scurvy. The immediate cause of scurvy is a disposition in the blood and other juiees to decomposition and breaking up with predomin- ating weakness of the capillary vascular system. Its symptoms are therefore all grounded on weakness, flabbiness, decay or entire destruction of the con- tractility of parts, which especially show themselves in the vascular system. The natural colour of the skin fails, it becomes pale and puffy; the patient feels a general weakness, and tires with the slightest motion. The gums begin to be painful, sv^ell and bleed on the slightest touch; the breath stinks. Upon the surface of the body appear here and there, especially upon the feet, bluish spots of various size, which spread and often enlarge into streaks. In hot climates cedematous swellings of the limbs occur. Mostly there appear on the skin small swellings with bid- ders, which drop in and are followed by purple-coloured spots. Pains come on in the feet, swellings of the knee-joints, ulcers, and frequent blu- ings from the gums. The weakness becomes very great; the patient spits, coughs, and vomits blood ; loses blood with his urine and by stool. The gums are often gangrenous; the blood is poured out in eveiy inter- space ; old scars break out, and the weakness from repeated bleeding is great that the patient faints on the least movement. He dies either in such fainting or of consumption.

COTTON—FLOUR. 115 cotton generally requires renewal about every six or eight days, until the sloughs have long separated and the discharge has been diminished. The comfort enjoyed during such intervals should go far to recommend this practice, even if, in other respects, it had no advantage over that by a daily renewal of the dressings. But I am now quite satisfied that a persevering use of this remedy, even in the chronic state of burns, and in many other ulcerations, is in every respects preferable to the practice usually adopted, (p. 211.) ^me care is necessary, both in preparing and in applying the cotton. For this purpose it should be finely carded, and disposed in narrow fleeces, so thin as to be translucent, by which means it cau be closely applied in successive layers, and is thus made to fill up and protect the most irregular surfaces. The burnt parts, if vesicated, are to be washed with tepid water, and the fluid evacuated by small punctures ; or, if more deeply scorched, they may be bathed with a spirituous or turpentine lotion. The cotton is then applied, layer after layer, until the whole surface is not only covered, but pro- tected at every point, so that pressure and motion may give no uneasiness. On some parts it will adhere without a bandage, especially when there is much discharge • but, m general, a support of this kind is useful. Where the vesications have been broken, and the skiii is abraded, or where there is sphacelus, more or less suppuration always ensues, and in such cases the discharge may be so great as to soak through the cotton and become ofiensive, particularly in summer; so that it may be necessary to remove the soiled portions. This, however, should be done as sparingly as possible, avoid uncovering or disturbing the tender surface, (pp. 213, 214.) Ihere appears,” Anderson further observes, “to be a twofold effect from this Sow primary effect arises from the exclusion of the air and the by-which the heat of the part is retained, whilst a soft ®^^bc protection from pressure is afforded. The secondary eflfect ^rmed by the cotton absorbing the^eflPused the best possible substitute for the lost cuticle. But, in order on benefit may be derived from this substitute, and to ensure an equable and continued support to the tender parts until the new skin is formed, “is absolute^ necessary that this new or cotton cuticle, as it may be called, should not be removed •» D^Wa!?^ f”'' >»‘™S ''as, I believe, Srst recommended by Mr. m 1„7’ ?f •Pa surgeone of the Manchester Infirmary, ,I EcirfrZSlbwT^^^ for, finding a young womaj’who hid if in tiip ppIH cfnnn ^ ’ j. ends, screaming with pain and shivering as prenaratorv tn thp^ ° intermittent whilst her mistress was rubbing in goose grease a^d then with of scraped potato, he absorbed the greafe with sofuTnen’ ‘Te'7,d“ T"' •'■”“•3 tirely relieved the n-iin TRo ^0“®'^ ^ be could, which almost immediately and en- cases fneigl same application was used by Ward in several other « ^^^i^ingtlifapplicationof liquids Of He strongly advises ment, and salves containing oil, all of which nrp ^ liniments, oint- removed by this first Vplieation R is advisab sleep, even though he have no nourishment « ®bould go to removing the linen coverings or bandages from thn«o return we must commence by considerable, without attempting to reSe an^ of the^r such portions as do not adLreT and then nmcped 1= r^ Pi’eviously applied, except copiously to the painful parts, by meaus of the ^PP^^ ^fi^ially and method of effecting it. * * * It ■B'onld nUr. r which is the easiest and best first and several of the succeeding dredgings or SDfinkl®^°*^^f^ P‘‘'’^*°'^larly at the a certoin time (longer or shorter, accorifinif to thi^r 1+^ tiie process lor of pain complained of) after the parts becUe Jasv r *^ the degree Stole a.s long as possible,) and steadily to nemLerl^l beep them in that object be attained, or the parts affected shall have rpp the last-mentioned mvcbablc arficlc of f«„‘a M »S vKTS f„T7“T'“S «f • Twolapers; in Lancet, vol. ii. 18‘’8 I 2

Attempts have been made to close the opening by healing over it a flap of skin (a). 472.

Without this simultaneous injury, however, wounds of the gullet may be very arge; it may even be entirely divided without the wound being absolutely fatal (6) Injuries of the gullet in large wounds can be ascertained bv the eye, by examination with the finger, and also by the fluid swallowed cougif person, escaping through the wound, and exciting severe 473.

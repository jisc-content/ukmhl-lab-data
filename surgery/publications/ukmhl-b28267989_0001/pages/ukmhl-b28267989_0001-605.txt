TREPHINING. 421 1 beyond the plane of tlie trephine, and its point being placed on the skull is made to I descend into its substance by alternate contrary turns ot the handle of the instrument, I till the toothed edge of the crown, which moves round it, begins to bite and cuts a track tfor itself sufficiently deep to prevent its slipping out, when the pivot is retracted into :the stem of the iiistrunient, whieh is necessary, as it being lonpr than the crown of the trephine, it would penetrate the skull before the crown of tlie trephine, and make a •Avouiid in the dura mater and brain, an aecideiit whieh, from gross carelessness on the part of the operator, I have once witnessed. .... As soon as the trephine has worked a track sufficient to retain it in place, an exarnin- lation of the track should be made with a thin-eyed probe to ascertain whether the skull ibe penetrated, and at what points. This is a most important step in the operation, for as in adults the thickness of the skull varies considerably in different individuals, land even in different parts of the skull in the same individual, and as in elderly persons it is often thin, and in children always thin, and still thinner the younger the child is, 60 unless the depth of the trephine-cut through the skull be ascertained, the bone may be cut through at one or other part of the trephine-track, and the membranes below seriously torn, or even cut through, and the brain itself injured. In proportion as the trephine-crown descends into the bone, the pressure made on its handle in working it, is to be diminished, or otherwise the Surgeon will, to his dismay, and the great danger I of his patient, find the crown suddenly descend, all resistance cease, and that the dura \ mater and brain are torn. This too I have seen happen. It must, therefore, be remem- iiered that in both young and old persons, and in the former especially, the trephine is to be handled with only sufficient pressure to make its crown cut. When the crown is found to have descended so low that there is reasonable expecta- tion that the internal table of the skull is on the point of being cut through, or when, by [Examination with the probe, it is found to have been cut through at one or more points, [:he edge of the elevator is to be carefully introduced into the trephine track, and the piece of bone included within the latter gently prised up, which is easily done if the li’emainder of the unsawn inner table be very thin, and it then yields with a crack and lis lifted out. If, however, the remaining unsawn part will not yield, the trephine must loe again applied with a light hand, and the examination with the probe repeated. If nhe tone be sawn through at one part of the track, but the other part will not break I vith such justifiable force as can be applied with the elevator, the sawing must be re- I -.umed, but with the trephine tilted, so that it shall act only on the part not cut through; Imd this is to be repeated again and again, with intermediate examination with the Ihrobe and repeated attempts with the elevator, till the trephined piece of bone can be separated. L In adults the detached bone is generally lifted off the dura mater without difficulty, l.nd always easily if blood or pus be poured out between that membrane and the skull. ISut in young pereons, and children especially, this is not the case, for the numerous I'essels at that age passing through the skull bones, from the dura mater to thepericraniu7H, I ind in the contrary direction, hold it, like hooks, very tightly, and offer so great a re- llstance to its removal as often to lead to the supposition that the separation from the I djoining bone is not complete. This is a very important point, and cannot be too care- lolly remembered. I It must also not be forgotten that, in operating for depressed fractures of the'skull, the l.'ephine is applied not on the depressed portion of bone, but on the neighbouring part, I'Inch retains its natural place, to form an opening through which an elevator may be Introduced beneath the depressed portion, for the purpose either of raising it to its pro- ■ er level, and relieving the brain from pressure, or for taking it entirely away, if it be I etached as well as driven in. Therefore the operation is not concluded by removing l.ie trephined piece, but only the preliminary step taken to the actual object of the opera- l on, to wit, the raising of the depressed bone, which is to be done by caretully passino- ftie elevator through the trepan hole, and insinuating it between the dura mater and the nepressed piece ; which done, either the finger of the left hand or the edge of the trepan ■ ole is to be made the fulcrum on which the elevator rests, whilst its handle being de- fcessed, the point rises and lifts up with it the depressed bone to its proper level. ■i If, after thus doing, the fractured bone be only loosely conneeted or entirely detached, ■ r if several pieces be broken and thrust in the dura mater and brain, it is best to re- ■love them either with the elevator alone, or with a pair of forceps, as may be most ■ mvenient.—J.

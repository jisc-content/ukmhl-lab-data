98 TREATMENT OF HOSPITAL GANGRENE. mended. If the s\irface of the wound do not improve in appearance, its entire extent should be touched with nitrate of silver, or conical pieces of caustic laid in the viscid mass. But, under these circumstances, the most important remedy is the free application of the actual cautery to the whole surface of the ulcerated part. The slough is to be covered with powdered bark and turpentine or some stimulating salve, and when the slough has separated, tlie appearance of the wound must determine whether the ap- plication of the cautery is to be repeated or not. Besides these means, the following may also be recommended ; decoction of bark, diluted mineral acids, especially hydrochloric acid, yeast poultices, spirituous lotions, brandy and myrrh, aloes and camphor, hydrochlorate of am- monia with water and vinegar, spir. terebinth, ung. styrac. and Egyptia- cum, balsam of copaiva, solutions of bichloride of mercury and nitrate of silver, butyr of antimony, pyroligneous acid, lemon juice and so on. 80. General treatment, suited to the different condition of the patient, must also be connected with this local treatment. At the onset, if symptoms of irritation and active febrile excitement are present, acid drinks, espe- cially dilute mineral acids, are serviceable ; in impurities of the stomach, emetics; in great weakness, bark and other tonic remedies; only in rare cases is a strict antiphilogistic plan of treatment called for. The diet must of course correspond with the general treatment, and care should be taken for purity of air and keeping the patient apart from others.

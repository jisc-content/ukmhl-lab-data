In- flammation of the joint-ends of bones, i. 237 ; symptoms, i. 237 ; Brodie on inflam- mation of the joint-ends of the bones, its S}’mptoms and progress, i. 238 ; Brodie on the consequence of this inflammation, i. 238 ; Key on the two forms of disease in the bone, resulting in absorption of the car- tilage, i. 238; the chronic form is of a strumous nature, i. 238 ; the acute form differs from the former in the suddenness of the attack, and in the appearance of the bone, i. 238; progress of the acute disease, and appearance of the bone, i. 239 ; Good- sir on the scrofulous disease of the cancel- lated texture of the heads of bone, i. 239 ; post-mortem appearances, i. 239 ; situation and causes of the disease, i. 239 ; Brodie and Key on the period at which it is likely to occur, i. 239; Brodie observes that it is likely to occur in several joints at once, or in succession, i. 239; Brodie and Sonth's opinion that the occurrence of scrofulous disease in the joint has sus- pended the progress of some other and perhaps more serious disease elsewhere, i. 240; Brodie on the diagnosis between scrofulous disease of the joint-ends of bones and ulceration of the articular car- tilages, i. 240; prognosis and treatment, i. 240 ; favourable consequences of ulcera- tion of the cartilages, i. 240 ; may occur in one of two ways, i. 240; in the first the cartilage is replaced by a layer of ivory-like bone, and the motions of the joint continue, i. 240; in the second, the opposed ends of the bones are united, either by a ligamento-fibrous structure, or by bone, i. 240; South has seen the con- necting medium composed partly of liga- mento-fibrous, and partly of bony matter, i. 240; South on the ivory-like covering of the joint-surfaces of bones, i. 240 ; Key and Toynbee on the removal of the arti- cular cartilages in old age i. 241 ; South and Brodie on the removal of the articular cartilages in old age as the result of pre- vious ulceration, i. 241; John Hunter on anchylosis, i. 241; anchylosis effected by the whole substance of the articulation, i. 241 ; of two kinds, i. 241; Hunter on the inflammatory and scrofulous diseases of joints causing anchylosis, i. 242; Hunter on soft anchylosis from granulations, i. 242 ; flunteron bony anchylosis, i. 242; South’s views on anchylosis differ somewhat from those of Hunter, i. 242; South on soft anchylosis from granulations, i. 242; Key on the formation of a vascular membrane in joints as a preliminary to anchylosis, i. 242 ; South’s case of fibrous anchylosis, i. 243 ; South’s case of the complication of bony and fibrous anchylosis, i. 245;

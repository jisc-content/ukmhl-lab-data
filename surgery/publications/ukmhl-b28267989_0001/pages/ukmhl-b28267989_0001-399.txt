SUBACUTE INFLAMMATION OF SYNOVIAL MEMBRANE. 215 If the acute stage be checked, it sometimes subsides entirely, but at other the indammation becomes chronic, or terminates in the effusion of a large quantity of fluid in the cavity. _ . ^ xi. In the much more frequent subacute or chronic form, when “ inflammation ot the synovial membrane takes place, as a symptom of constitutional affection, where the system is under the influence of gout or rheumatism, &c.,” Buodie says, “ iii these cases, the disease, for the most part, is not very severe; it occasions a preternatural secretion of synovia, but does not, in general, terminate in the effusion of coagulable lymph, or in thickening of the inflamed membrane. Sometimes it attacks the greater number of the joints at the same instant, and even extends to the synovial membranes, which constitute the bursa: mucosa: and sheatlis of the tendons. At other times, it leaves one part to attack another, and several joints are affected in succession. In other cases, the disease is entirely local, produced by a sprain, or other injury, or the application of cold, and sometimes arising from no evident cause. * * * Where the inflammation is thus confined to a single joint, it is more probable that it will assume a severe character, and that it may be of long duration. It leaves the joint with its functions more or less impaired, and occasionally terminates in its total destruction. In itself it is a serious disease; but it is often confounded under the alarming name of white swelling, with otlier diseases, which are still more serious.” (pp. 21, 2.) “ The pain,” Bkodie observes, “ usually continues to increase during the first week or ten days, when it is at its height. Sometimes even at this period the pain is trifling, so that the patient experiences but little inconvenience from it: at other times it is consi- derable, and every motion of the joint is distressing and difficult. In the course of one or two days after the commencement of the pain, the joint may be observed to be swollen. At first the swelling arises entirely from a preternatural collection of fluid in its cavity. In the superficial joints, the fluid may be distinctly felt to undulate when pressure is made alternately by the two hands placed one on each side. When the inflammation has existed for some time, the fluid is less perceptible than before, in consequence of the synovial membrane having become thickened, or from the effusion of lymph on its inner or outer surface; and, in many cases, where the disease has been of long standing, al- though the joint is much swollen, and symptoms of inflammation still exist, the fluid in its cavity is scarcely to be felt. As the swelling consists more of solid substance, so the natural mobility of the joint is, in a great degree, impaired.” (p. 23-5.) “ Inflammation may attack the synovial membranes in different degrees of intensity ; but, for the most part, it has the form of a chronic or slow inflammation, which, while it impairs, does not altogether destroy the functions of the joint; and which, if not relieved, in the first instance, by active and judicious treatment, may, like a chronic ophthalmia, continue for weeks or months, and, with occasional recoveries and relapses, may even harass and torment the patient during several successive years.” (p. 23.) “ The form of the swelling deserves notice. It is not that of the articulating ends of the bones, and, therefore, it differs from the natural form of the joint. The swelling arises chiefly from the distended state of the synovial membrane, and hence its figure depend^ in great measure, on the situation of the ligaments and tendons, which resist it in certain directions, and allow it to take place in others. Thus, when the knee is affected, the swelling is principally observable on the anterior and lower part of the thigh, under the extensor muscles, where there is only a yielding cellular structure between those mu^les and the bone. It is also often considerable in the spaces between the ligament of the patella and the lateral ligaments; the fluid collected in the cavity causing the fatty substance to protrude in this situation, where the resistance of the external parts is less than elsewhere. In the elbow, the swelling is principally observable in the posterior d • 'n olechranon, and under the extensor muscles of the tore arm. o 1 X ^ ankle, it shows itself on each side, in the space between the lateral ligaments “Aft '"'hich are situated on the anterior part.” (pp. 25, 6.) and '“flammation of the synovial membrane has subsided, the fluid is absorbed, instances, the joint regains its natural figure and mobility; but, in other Swelling remain.

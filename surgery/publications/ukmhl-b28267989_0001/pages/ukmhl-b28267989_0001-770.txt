This bone was entirely deprived of its shell excepting its articular surfaces, butfW the hinder one for the astragalus was broken. The shell of the bone was fracturejK' into numerous pieces of various size, and the Achilles’ tendon was partially detach^^H Amputation was recommended, but to this she would not submit; and therefore, aft^Bj removing all the loose pieces of bone, I brought the edges together, with the view of H producing adhesion. Sloughing, however, ensued, and she died exhausted on the sixth S day after the accident.—J. F.

Whether simple or accompanied with wound, they are besi^B treated by wrapping up in a poultice, and rest, without any bandagingj^B If the soft parts be much injured, the whole toe generally sloughs, .so^B that it may be as well to amputate at once, especially as the gait is not^H much affected thereby. This, however, does not apply to the great which is a very important part of the foot, and a very principal agent in ^ walking, and therefore should be amputated only under circumstances of B absolute necessity; as by its removal not only considerable halting is produced, but the pressure made on the scar induces ulceration and great W inconvenience. A pasteboard splint, if the fracture be simple, attached with some slips of adhesive plaster, is sufficient; and the patient should be kept quiet and not allowed to bear on his foot. If the fracture befl| compound, it is best to apply a poultice, under which the wound healsS either by quick union or by granulation ; and when the scarring has taken* place, then a pasteboard splint or a gum roller may be applied for the'* completion of the cure.—J. f. s.]

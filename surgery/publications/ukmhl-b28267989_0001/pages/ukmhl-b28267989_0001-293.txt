I have sometimes seen the erysipelas extend up to the belt and there stop ; at other times I have observed it move on without having met with any check. I am therefore doubtful of the efficiency of the nitrate of silver; but, if used, it should be carefully applied, even to blistering the skin, otherwise it is certainly useless.—J. F. S.] 92. As various also are the opinions as to erysipelas consequent on M'ounds, {^Erysipelas traumaticum,^ in which the most opposite fomenta- tions, blisters, incisions and scarifications, cauterization with the red-hot iron, (Larrey,) antiphlogistic treatment, emetics, and so on, have been recommended. If the above-described different kinds of erysipelas and pseudo-erysipelas be borne in mind, and, if it be remembered that the traumatic erysipelas, which in four or five days accompanies wounds, is produced by difterent causes, as too great irritation of the wound by im- proper bandaging, foreign bodies, the application of greasy, too stimu- lating or too hot softening remedies, cold moist air, a bruised and torn condition of the wounded part, wounds of fibrous structures, gastro-biliary affections, mental excitement, improper food, and the like, it may be easily perceived, how a proper observation of the various causes can alone prevent a merely routine treatment of so important a disease (a).

The left side of tlie arch of fi th was likewise broken, and the spinous process of the third pressed down upon the louith vertebra. This preparation is in St. Thomas’s Museum. , . , j, • i ^ Case 2. A man threw himself into a river to bathe, from a height of seven or eight feet, the water being only three feet deep. He came up to the surface and imrnediately fell back to the bottom. The bystanders observing he made no attempt to swim, drew him out and lifted him insensible upon the bank. Upon the arrival of the medical mim he was found pulseless, but with priapism. By the use of ammonia he was Mvived, out his limbs were paralysed, and when admitted into the _ hospital an hour after, his oody was cold, pulse scarcely perceptible, and the skin quite insensible, but he was oerfectly sensible, complained of pain at tlie back of his neck, and could not move his lead, which swayed about with its own weight, and was free from ache. He had great lisposition to make water, but could not, and the introduction of the catheter was use- less, as the bladder contained none. He said, in reference to the accident, that at the noment when he struck the water he felt his hands touch the bottom of the river, and o save his head, drew it v iolently back, upon which he lost all consciousness. By rubbing and putting him in a warm bed, he raised himself and was a little able to iiove his limbs. But about three hours and a-half after his admission, fever with pro- iise sweating came on and his pulse was stronger and quicker. He soon became de- irious, uttered loud screams, and in ten hours aud a-half from the accident died. On examination, the back of the neck was largely ecchymosed, the interspaces of the unscles were gorged with blood, and the vertebral canal filled with it. The body of he fifth neck vertebra was broken across above the middle of its depth, and the two •ieces were completely separated from the lateral parts. Reveiiaon (a), who relates the case, thinks that as no contusion was apparent on the lead, and that, as it was not even smeared with dirt, it could not have touched the bottom f the river, and therefore that the fracture must have been caused by muscular action. The fracture is, however, more commonly caused either by falling down head foremost, r by a heavy weight dropping from a height upon the top of the head. In either case, he muscles being unprepared for receiving the violence, the necessary bracing up of he spine is therefore deficient, and consequently the spinal column is either bent uddeuly, violently, and excessively forward, and the force being transferred to one ertebra, the hinder edge of the bone is more orless’torn from the intervertebral substance, r the latter is at this part partially torn through, whilst the remainder still continues onnecting the body of the vertebra with that of the vertebra immediately below, of ^hich the fore and upper part is broken off obliquely downwards and forwards, and in his way the vertebra above the fracture, and with it the fractured upper part of the ertebra below, glide forward till the arch of the upper rests against the back of the ody of the lower vertebra, and thus compresses the spinal cord. This compression is lore complete if the capsules of the articular processes have been torn through, the recesses themselves broken off, or the arch fractured, under which circumstances that art of the spine above the fracture slips further forward, and the spinal arch is more ghtly pressed upon the spinal cord. The injury which the spinal cord suffers may be ither—1, simple concussion; 2, simple compression by bone ; 3, extravasation of blood ither without or within the sheath, or in both situations, and producing symptoms of arapression ; 4, extravasation of blood on the exterior of the cord itself; 5, tearing of ae cord to a greater or less extent, sometimes completely through; and either of these lay or may not be accompanied with corresponding tearing of the sheath. There are ot any peculiar symptoms which point out the extent of the mischief so as to assist in arming a diagnosis. The subsidence of the symptoms in a few days after the accident, 1 cases usually considered as concussion of the cord, is therefore no proof of such being Jally the case, as it may be possible that in slight extravasation of blood, which at first ould produce symptoms, the spinal cord would probably accommodate itself to the r^ure, and the symptoms subside under pi-oper treatment, as is well known they do. Patient completely recover, after apoplectic effusions in the brain. Tne dangerous circumstances connected with fracture of the spine do not depend on le fracture itself, but upon the injury which the cord sustains, and which is greater or *s, according to the greater or less displacement forwards of the upper part of the nne beyond the lower. This displacement almost invariably accompanies the fracture, 3u vanes according to the violent bending or blow which the spinal column suffers, nave known the upper vertebra, with the broken upper edge of that beneath it, ojected scarcely a quarter of an inch; and 1 have known it thrown forward more (a) Journal General cle Medecine, &c., xcviii. or xcvii of the Second Series.

16 attempts, at both of which I was present; but in both instances the result was fatal in a few hours. Being convinced that Mr. Wells' success must depend on some minutiae with which we were not acquainted, I went to London to see him, having made his acquaintance when we were attached to the same hospital during the Crimean War. I accompanied him to several of his private operations, and carefully observed every step of the proceedings. _ In April, 1864, I performed the operation on a patient in the Infirmary, and I had the pleasure of placing on record the first successful case of Ovariotomy m Glasgow or the West of Scotland. Since then it has been* yearly performed with an amount of success equal to that of any capital operation. Cancer of the tongue is one of the most distressing of surgical affections. The gnawing pain prevents sleep and exhausts the sufferer, who is in great part deprived of the power of speech and swallowing. When only a small part is affected, it is easy to remove it; but when a large portion is invaded the operation is a serious matter. It is necessary to cut away not only the diseased structure, but also a part of the sound tissue beyond, in order to avoid the risk of a return of the disease. Even after the most perfect operation the disease often recurs, either m the remaining part of the tongue or the adjacent glands; but it is certain to do so unless the can- cerous part is completely removed. Owing; to the extensive attachments of the tongue, it is _ very difficult to get access to it so as to make the incisions sufficiently free; and accordingly, in 1864, Mr. Syme proposed and executed a modification of previous operations, by dividing the lower jaw at the sym- physis, separating the two halves, and removing the whole organ from its attachments to the hyoid bone. This bold proceeding was in the first examples fol- lowed by a fatal result; but in a fourth case by leaving the attachments to the chm undivided, he

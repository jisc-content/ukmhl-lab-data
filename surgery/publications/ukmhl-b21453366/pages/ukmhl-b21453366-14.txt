12 which have no real value are soon put to an open test and find their level. Gentlemen, we live in an age of rapid advance- ment in all branches of science and art, and in our own department we are not lagging behind. Time would fail me to enumerate all the valuable improvements in surgery during recent years, but perhaps it might interest you if I briefly refer to some within my own experience. Two or three weeks after I was enrolled as a student of medicine news came from across the Atlantic that Mr. Morton, a dentist in Boston, had extracted teeth without causing pain, by making the patient inhale the vapour of sulphuric ether. The information was received in London on the 18th December, 1846. and on the 21st Mr. Liston, at University College Hospital, performed ampu- tation of the thigh and avulsion of the toe nail, the patients being quite unconscious of pain. The same night he wrote a note to a friend m Glasgow, who had been a student of his, informing him as to this property of ether. Immediately on the receipt of this intelligence I tried the ex- periment on myself, in presence of my lather who was at that time Surgeon to the Uoyai Infirmary, and other friends, with complete success; although my father put the insensibility to rather a severe test. I was thus the first person m Scotland who was made insensible to pam by the inhalation of ether. This is an old story now; but to me the memory of it comes back with all the vividness of a nrst year student. It is unnecessary to take up your time just now with any remarks on Anaesthesia ; but there is one point which I think has escaped the notice it deserves. In estimating the number of deaths which have happened under chloroform there are various sources of error, one of which was forced on my attention in a most remarkable way.

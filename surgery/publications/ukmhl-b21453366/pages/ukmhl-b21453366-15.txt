13 When we consider the very small number of deaths from chloroform, and the large number of instan- taneous or sudden deaths arising from what are called natural causes, the question arises—" Have none of these alleged chloroform deaths been really examples of deaths which would have happened independently of the administration of chloroform?" Three years ago a patient with a small tumour on the lip was recommended to me by Professor Allen Thomson. The patient and his wife took apartments in the vicinity of my house for my convenience. A day was fixed for the operation; but on the morning I received an urgent call to the country, so that the operation was postponed. The same evening the landlady called on me to tell me that her lodger had gone out for a walk in the forenoon and had not returned. Next morn- ing I received the startling intelligence that my patient had fallen down dead on the street at about midday, the very hour I had appointed for the operation. Had I at the critical moment been administering chloroform, I have no doubt that I myself would have attributed to it the death which happened as I have stated. When I was house-surgeon in the Royal In- firmary there was admitted to my wards a patient suffering from vesicovaginal fistula, at that time a most intractable affection. The gentleman under whom I was acting was an ingenious surgeon and clever operator—the late Dr. William Lyon—and he made many attempts to improve the patient by operative and other means, but without avail. As usual in such cases, the patient was dismissed in statu quo, although at the present day an operation would be performed with almost perfect certainty of success. Shortly after that Dr. Marion Sims of New York began to make that affection his study, and by the most painstaking efforts succeeded in contriving one of the most ingenious operations

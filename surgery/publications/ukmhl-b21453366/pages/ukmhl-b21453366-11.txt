9 been elicited, they are led to form a correct opinion —the surgeon either putting questions to them, or giving them a short address, or, what is perhaps more useful, thinking aloud while the examination is going on. The appropriate treatment is then explained or carried out, either by the surgeon himself or by the dressers appointed to the ward. Day after day the students watch the progress of the case, which is thus impressed upon their minds, and becomes an actual experience. . But it is quite obvious that in a large number of the most interesting cases such a method could not be adopted. To a great many patients it would be most hurtful to hear their diseases dis- cussed and explained in their presence, especially when they are of a dangerous nature, and when a serious operation is necessary as a part of the treatment. In all cases we desire to spare the feel- ings of the sick—both from motives of humanity and as an element of successful treatment. Accord- ingly, when there is anything which would be unpleasant or prejudicial to be stated at the bed- side, the surgeon repairs with his students to the theatre, where he is free to give without reserve his candid opinion from a review of the whole circumstances noted. But inasmuch as all are not equally fortunate in getting near the bedside—though arrangements will be made for attaining that position in rotation —a different mode is adopted at the lectures on clinical surgery, a plan to make the instruction equally available to all who are present in the theatre; that is, to bring the patients from the wards into the place of lecture. The patient is placed in a chair, or if he is unable to walk remains on the bed which has heen brought from the ward. He is then examined just as formerly described, and removed to an adjoining apartment. A commentary is then given on the disease, and

22 morning visit, a foreign gentleman presented me a card of introduction from a friend at that time residing in Germany. The writing was not very- legible, and I did not notice the name, but asked the stranger to accompany me. Standing beside the bed of a patient who was recovering from a compound depressed fracture of the frontal bone, without hav- ing had a bad symptom, I said, " We are indebted in great part to one of your countrymen for our present improved mode of treating such cases. We have been taught almost to abandon the use of the trephine by Stromeyer of Hanover." "My father- in-law," replied my visitor. " Indeed," I exclaimed, "and you are?" "Esmarch of Kiel." It so hap- pened that, on the morning in question, I was to remove a large vascular scrotal tumour. Dr. Esmarch accompanied me to the theatre, and the patient was put under the influence of chloroform. Turning to Dr. Esmarch, I said, " It is a great pity that your bloodless method is not applicable to such a case, as I shall operate with great anxiety, owing to the exhausted condition of the man and the great vascularity of the tumour." He at once undertook to apply pressure in a way which, he believed, would prevent any hasmorrhage. Being provided with a long India rubber tube, he passed it round the base of the scrotum, across the pubis, and round the loins, and fixed it in front of the abdomen. To my sur- prise and delight, I removed the great mass by a complicated and tedious dissection, without the loss of any blood except what escaped at the first incision from the gorged veins on the surface. The man was dismissed with the wound quite healed in three weeks, and I have no doubt the rapidity of his recovery was in great part owing to his having been spared the loss of blood. But time would fail me were I to recount all the recent advances in surgical science and manipulation. There is one subject which, however, cannot be here

19 was dissatisfied with the slowness of the improve- ment, and also with the ultimate result. On study- ing some cases, I became satisfied that the deformity depended more on the structures in the sole of the foot than on the tendons of the leg. _ The incision recommended by most authors was evidently made without any well defined object, and naturally failed in its effect. By altering the position, direction, and depth of the incision, I was enabled to divide those structures which I believe to be at fault, and the result altogether exceeded my expectation. This is not the place to enter into detail; but some of the most obstinate cases have yielded after these deep incisions. The next example is a curious illustration of the application of physiological knowledge to the treat- ment of disease. It was originated by a German surgeon in 1862 ; but it had suggested itself to me two years previously. In the winter of 1859 I was engaged in making some dissections of the palate and pharynx, for the purpose of illustrating to my students the mechanism of swallowing. In examin- ing the levator palati muscle I was satisfied that, in consequence of its origin from the lower part of the orifice of the Eustachian tube, its action in raising the soft palate would at the same time draw down and so open the orifice. It was obvious that the change in the position of the palate from its pendul- ous to its horizontal direction would diminish the capacity of the upper or nasal compartment of the pharynx, and so expel some of the contained air from the nostril. Now it occurred to me, that if the nos- trils were firmly held together by the finger and thumb during an act of deglutition, advantage might be taken of the double .action of the levator- palati to get some of the air thus compressed forced into the Eustachian tube, which might be of service in clearing away any temporary obstacle which was a cause of Eustachian deafness. Just at this time a

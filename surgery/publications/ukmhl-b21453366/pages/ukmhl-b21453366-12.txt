By a series of these isolated lessons the student gathers his general principles, and has his mind stored with vivid examples which he never forgets. It must be obvious, therefore, that clinical instruction is the most vital part of a student's education. But while it is simple enough to decide on the best method of conveying this information, every- thing depends on the way in which it is received.

in the most reliable treatises on the subject; but I IS the Infirmary, from 1796 till 1858, contains records of only seven cases, and of these, four were in female patients; so that, in truth, in Glasgow and in most parts of Scotland the subject of lithotrity was a dead letter. The way in which I was induced to adopt it is rather interesting, at least to myself. In 1861 a gentleman, aged sixty-four, consulted me with symptoms of stone; and on examination I detected its presence. Being a relative of my own, I declined to operate; and he selected Mr. Syme, who removed two calculi each the size of a nutmeg. Three years after the urinary symptoms reappeared, and. again I discovered a stone. But this time my patient declared he would not submit to the cutting operation, and Mr. Syme was consulted about litho^ trity. This he declined to perform, and said he would advise the patient to bear the pain of the stone, rather than undergo the risk and uncertainty of the crushing operation. My patient, accordingly, proceeded to London, where I saw Sir Henry Thomp- son operate on him. I saw several other cases, and was so impressed with the value of the operation that I procured a case of instruments, and came home determined to practise the operation here. I had to wait for a suitable case till the 6th July, 1866, on which day I performed lithotrity in presence of the students of the Infirmary. The case terminated favourably, and I have frequently performed it since with great success ; and I am glad to say that others are adopting it in. preference to lithotomy in suitable cases. There are few deformities more distressing to the patient, or to the parents if it is a child that is in question, than talipes varus, or club foot. From a veiy early period of my professional life it has fallen to my lot to operate on these cases. At first I was in the habit of performing the operation necessary to remedy the deformity in the manner recommended

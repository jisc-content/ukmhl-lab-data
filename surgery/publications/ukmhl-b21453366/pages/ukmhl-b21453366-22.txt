20 young lady, in a family upon whom 1 was making a professional visit, asked me if I could do anything for deafness. I said I did not profess to practise aural surgery; but requested her, after I left, to swallow some water two or three times while she held her nostrils compressed between her finger and thumb. Judge of my surprise when I called next morning, to be told that after swallowing the third time she experienced a sensation of crackling in her ear, and the deafness instantaneously disappeared and did not return. I recounted and explained the circumstance to my students that day; and every year since, when demonstrating the structure of the palate, I have mentioned it in connection with the physiology of swallowing. In 18 62 Politzer of Vienna published his new method of restoring Eustachian deafness, by the very means I have described, with the addition of the introduction of a stream of con- densed air, admitted to the pharynx by a tube passed through one of the compressed nostrils. Politzeriza- tion, as it is now called, is one of the regular pro- ceedings of aurists, and is an almost certain way of removing deafness caused by Eustachian obstruction. It is strange how long a time sometimes inter- venes between the announcement of an undoubted improvement in surgical operations and its accept- ance by the profession. I hold in my hand a little volume, published in 1806 by Dr. Jeffrey, at that time Professor of Anatomy in this University. It contains an account of several cases of excision of carious jointsâ€”two of the knee, by Mr. Park of Liver- pool, performed as long ago as 1781, and three of the elbow, by M. Moreau in France, at the beginning of this century. It also contains a commentary on the subject by Dr. Jeffrey, and the description of a saw which he invented to facilitate the proceedings. But the operation did not produce that impression on the surgeons of the day which might have been expected; and it lay almost in abeyance till Mr. Syme

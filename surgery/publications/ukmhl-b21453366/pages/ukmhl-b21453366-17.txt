During the first half of this century isolated attempts' were made by various surgeons to remove Ovarian cysts some of them with success; but with such a pre- ponderance of mortality, that many of the most distinguished surgeons maintained that it was utterly indefensible, and could not be Â« encouraged and con- tinued without danger to the character of the profes- sion Between 1840 and 1850 several fortunate results were obtained by Dr. Clay of Manchester and others; and m 1858 Mr Spencer Wells began that series of improvements in attention to details ot operating and after treatment, which gave rise to his unprecedented success, and established the opera- tion on a permanent footing.

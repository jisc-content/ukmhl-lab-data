17 succeeded in removing the whole tongue with perfect success, the patient being able afterwards both to speak and swallow. It was obvious that the earlier operations were fatal in consequence of the extent of the mutilation, and division of the muscles which steady the hyoid bone. On reflecting on the nature of the disease, it occurred to me that a much less severe mutilation might serve the purpose. Cancer of the tongue most frequently begins at the side, caused by friction against a broken tooth, or the irritation produced by smoking a short pipe. Its progress is gradually to creep backwards, but it rarely crosses to the other side till it has invaded almost the whole of that in which it began. A case of this disease was admitted under my care in the Infirmary in May, 1865, which gave me the oppor- tunity of putting my idea into execution. I followed the first steps of Mr. Syme's proceeding. I then cleft the tongue from the tip to the hyoid bone, and removed the whole of the diseased half by a lateral cut. Examination of the excised half showed that my knife had gone quite beyond the disease. The patient made a good recovery, and is alive and well at the present day, in Lochranza in Arran; she is known to almost every one on the island. I consider that the plan of removing the lateral affected half, instead of the whole organ, which I have now fre- quently performed, is not only free from danger, but promises most satisfactory results. The treatment of stone in the bladder is a sub- ject always most interesting to students. When I was a student lithotomy was the only operation performed for its relief; and up till the time I became surgeon to the Infirmary the other form of operation, viz., lithotrity, was practically ignored. Lectures on it were given in the systematic courses ; but only to mention it as a surgical curiosity, or with the hope that further improvements would se- cure its ultimate adoption.

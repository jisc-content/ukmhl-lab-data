7 as that was made plain to him, he resigned his chair in London, and returned to Edinburgh, to restrict his attention to clinical surgery, for the reasons I have just specified. When you have two professors teaching the same subject, though in a different manner, you are sure to escape the danger of a one-sided view, which you almost unconsci- ously adopt by listening to the teaching of one man alone. In many of the great medical schools there is a special lecturer on clinical surgery. Sir William Fergusson is professor of that branch in King's College, London ; Mr. Erichsen at University Col- lege ; and^ for some years before his retirement. Sir James Paget had that duty at St. Bartholomew's; while in Edinburgh, the chair held for many years by Mr. Syme, and at present by Mr. Lister, is one of the most important in the university; and I believe that the time is not far distant when every fully equipped medical school will have lecturers devot- ing themselves exclusively to it, I shall now shortly state, for the information of those unacquainted with it, the scope and mode 01 conducting that branch of the curriculum with which I have been intrusted. The simplest idea ot clinical surgery is to be derived from the appren- ticeship system, m which a surgeon gives to a pupil or apprentice committed to his care, or acting as an assistant, the information which is to be obtained in the exercise of his private practice.

He also learns how to prepare the medicines required to apply bandages and generally gains a fair know- ledge of the art of prescribing. Such is the ideal of the apprenticeship system, "in actual expense

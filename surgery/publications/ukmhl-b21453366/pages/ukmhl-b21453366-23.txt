21 rescued it from oblivion, and by adopting it sys- tematically as a substitute for amputation of the arm, became practically the introducer into this country of the now universal excision of the elbow. He also extended it to the shoulder, but strongly objected to its application to the wrist, hip, knee, or ankle. Other surgeons, especially Sir William Fer- gusson, applied it to these joints; and Mr. Lister, while surgeon in our Infirmary, contrived a sys- tematic operation for removal of the wrist. This extensive manipulation, however, is rarely required, it often being sufficient to remove with gouge and forceps the diseased portions. In a week or two vou will see in the Western Infirmary a patient in whom the disease was so extensive that she came to me to have her arm amputated; but by the proceed- ing I have mentioned she has not only retained her hand, but with her fingers she is able to support herself by needlework. One of the most remarkable achievements of modern surgery is skin grafting. When a raw sur- face, whether the result of ulceration, sloughing, or laceration, is very extensive, the process of cicatri- zation stops before it is all covered. Under these circumstances the surgeon can transplant a small portion of live skin, which takes root, so to speak, on the raw surface, and is a centre from which cica- trization begins and spreads all around. Cases which formerly were hopeless are now successfully treated by this method. The Antiseptic mode of dressing wounds has, I believe, been a great boon to surgery, though its principles and practice are by no means universally accepted ; but this is not the place to enter into details on a matter which will form the subject of demonstration in our clinical wards. At the present time improvements in surgical manipulation are daily being introduced. Three or four weeks ago, on entering the Infirmary at the

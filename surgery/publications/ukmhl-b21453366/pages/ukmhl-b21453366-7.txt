in medical practice, would seriously interfere with their usefulness in investigating and teaching their several departments in science. But with clinical lecturers it is different. An extended practical experience in the treatment of disease is necessary to make their instruction of real value. Theoretical knowledge, however extensive, and by whatever means of study acquired, is of no essential use unless it has been put to the test of experienceâ€” an experience gained by the practice of surgery both in public and private. This double experience is, I think, important; for although the principles of treatment are the same, whether aj^plied to a patient in the hospital or one in his own house, still the application of the principle must vary according to the means available for carrying it out. This remark is especially applicable to mechanical surgery, or the application of splints, bandages, and other apparatus in the treatment of disloca- tions, fractures, and other casualties. In the hospital there is always at hand a plentiful supply of the most useful apparatus, so that the surgeon and his assistants are not often called upon to exercise much ingenuity in contriving suitable appliances for the cases admitted; but in private practice a surgeon is often called to see persons living at a distance from any depot of such apparatus, and must rely on his own mechanical skill to furnish what is necessary. Accordingly, in giving clinical instruction to students, a most important feature is the introduction of such con- trivances as the surgeon has found available in emergencies, and making the students imitate or contrive for themselves, with such materials as may be found in any house, the applications required for a given case. Besides this there are a number of surgical affections, of which but few cases are ever seen in hospital; and when they do occur the surgeon uses them as texts from which to

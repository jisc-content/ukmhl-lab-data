6 give the student the benefit of his experience in private practice. From all this it must be evident that a clinical surgeon, to be a useful teacher, must have private as well as hospital practice, and to that extent the time at his command to devote to students must be limited, and hence the importance of a chair devoted exclusively to Clinical Instruction. But another reason for the foundation of a chair of Clinical Surgery is that it secures to the student the advantage of receiving instruction in surgery from at least two separate teachers in that branch, accredited by the University. There are surgical affections so obscure, and problems so difficult, and operations so intricate, that in explaining them no two men will enunciate the same ideas or use the same language, though their ultimate aim may be the same. And in the practice of surgery there is room for such difference of opinion, that two opposite views may be taken of the same case. Now it has often been said that in the education of young men it is a mistake to give them a number of conflicting opinions, since it tends to confuse rather than clear up the subject under dis- cussion ; but I do not think so poorly of the mental calibre of our students, as to believe that they are only fit to be crammed with ex cathedra statements. In practice they must meet with the difficulty of forming an opinion, by the careful consideration of a great variety of signs and symptoms, and the sooner they are brought face to face with that difficulty, by hearing the contrary opinions of different surgeons on the same subject, the more earnestly will they apply themselves to master it When the late Mr. Syme went to London to succeed Mr. Liston as Professor of Clinical Surgery in University College, he found to his dismay that he was expected to undertake the lectures on systematic as well as clinical surgery.

4 too burdensome to be undertaken by one professor, X_ even with the assistance of the additional examiner^ appointed by the University Court. This task has hitherto been performed with great fidelity by the Professor of systematic surgery, with the aid of one of the assessors, but at the expense of such an amount of time and labour as could not well be looked for as a continuance. The former duty, that of teaching, has been ably performed by the sur- geons of the Glasgow Eoyal Infirmary ; but m view of the opening of the Western Infirmary, which will naturally be the practical school for students of the University of Glasgow, the University authorities have taken the opportunity to found a new chair, that of clinical surgery, with the object of attaching to their medical school a professor who should devote his time to the teaching of clinical surgery to the exclusion of any other branch oi medical science. It is to be presumed that the future occupants of this chair will be men who have gained experience as practical surgeons, and naturally their services will be much in request, both by the public and their professional brethren. It follows, therefore, that only a limited _ portion 1 of their time will be available for teaching, and J that will be concentrated on clinical work. In this respect clinical teaching differs from the systematic teaching of most of the fundamental branches ot medicaf science. Anatomy, physiology, chemistry, botany, and zoology are best taught by men whose attention is not distracted by the anxieties ot pro- fessional practice, and who have time to work out, and think out, the problems which are constantly springing up in the advancement of science, lheir appropriate place is the laboratory and the study, and the facts which they deal with can be eluci- dated without any direct reference to the inroads of disease as seen in the living subject. Accoid- ingly for the professors of these branches to engage

METHOD OF PERFORMING A TYPICAL AMPUTATION 497 tions, and particularly in feeble subjects, the prevention of shock is a matter of the highest importance. The vari(jus measures both f(jr the prophylaxis and treatment of shock have already been dealt with in detail in Vol. I. p. 117. The more important of these are the use of a heated table and a warm room and the preliminary administration of adrenalin or pituitary extract and rectal enemata of brandy and beef tea. In some cases the employment of spinal analgesia (see Vol. I. p. 486) may be of value. A good plan in these cases, in which severe shock is expected, is to apply a nibber band horizontally round the upper part of the thighs so as to retain blood in them. As soon as the main vessels have been tied the bands are removed and the limbs elevated, thus allowing the blood retained in the limbs to circulate once more and thus practically to transfuse the patient. As a rule, however, there is but httle shock, even in amputations through the thigh, except in Fig. 225.—Lynk Thomas's H.cmostatic Forceps. The probe-pointed blade underruns the tissues containing the vessels to be compressed, while the other blade exerts pressure on the skin.

They then obviate all risk of the circular tubing slipping. A pad may be placed over the line of the femoral and gluteal vessels for additional security. cases of primary amputation done for an injury in which profound shock is present before the operation is done.

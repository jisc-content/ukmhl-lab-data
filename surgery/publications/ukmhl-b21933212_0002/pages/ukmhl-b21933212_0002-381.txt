FRACTURES OF THE OLECRANON however, where there is great separation, it may be advisable to turn the flap upwards because it is then easy to prolong the ends of the incision up along the back of the arm, if it should be necessary to lengthen the triceps (see p. 344). A flap consisting of skin and fascia only is turned down, and when the fracture is reached the gap between the fragments is evident at once. If the rent in the deep fascia be incomplete, it is well to enlarge it, and if its torn edges be inverted over the fractured surfaces, they must be turned out of the way ; all clots are removed from the Fig. 158.â€”Operation FOR Wiring Tur Olecranon. Drilling the boiie. The catch- forceps are shown in position on either side of the vertical incision through the perios- teum, the edges of which they hold apart as the drill is passed. The point of the drill is seen emerging just behind the articular cartilage. A vertical slit has been made in the soft parts over the fractured process, which has not yet been drilled. joint before the fractured ends are fastened together. The fixation of the fragments may be effected by means of a plate (see p. 307) if desired, but upon the whole we have found wiring preferable. Wiring is done as follows: A median vertical incision a quarter of an inch long is made through the periosteum of the ulna about half an inch below the line of fracture, and, before the knife is removed, the two edges of this incision are seized with catch-forceps and held apart, so as to expose the bone beneath (see Fig. 158). A hole is then bored obliquelv through the bone with a bradawl, the point emerging on the fractured surface just behind the articular cartilage. After having ascertained the spot on the upper fragment exactly corresponding to this puncture by z 2

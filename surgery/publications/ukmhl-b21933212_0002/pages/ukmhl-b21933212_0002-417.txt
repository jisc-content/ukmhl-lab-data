FRACTURES OF THE UPPER END OF THE FEMUR 375 be confined to bed for more than a few days, and may then be allowed to commence walking with the assistance of two sticks. There is often some swelling of the limb below the fracture, but this usually gives no trouble. The disadvantage of the splint in fractures of the neck of the femur is that, if movement be allowed opposite the hip-joint, movement occurs at the line of the fracture and not in the joint itself, hence non- FiG. i8j.â€”Hoefftcke's Extension Splint for Fractures of the Femur. The right-hand figure shows the back view of the apparatus for a fracture of the neck of the femur. The left-hand one is a front view of that used for a fracture of the shaft of the bone. Both splints are identical in construction except that a pelvic band is added for fractures of the neck of the bone. (Hoefftcke.) union may occur. If bony union of the neck of the femur be desired the hip mixst be immobilised. The splint, however, is of great value in old people whom it is impossible to keep immobilised long enough to obtain firm union. Hence in yoimg and vigorous patients in whom the chance of union is good, the older methods are to be preferred at fiist, Hessing's sphnt being only apphed towards the end of the case. When, however, the chances of union are not good, or the patient is old and feeble, Hessing's

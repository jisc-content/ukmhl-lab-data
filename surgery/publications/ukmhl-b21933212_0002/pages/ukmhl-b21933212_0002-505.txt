There is usually no fever accompanying the affection, which varies very much in its virulence, some cases being quite mild, and others being almost beyond the reach of treatment. TREATMENT.â€”As soon as the disease is evident, the affected bone should be cut down upon ; if only a small portion be affected, the diseased area should be excised. If it be too extensive for this, the swelling must be thoroughly opened and scraped away, until as much of the disease as possible has been removed.

Very satisfactory results are obtained in this way, and an actual cure may result even in extensive cases.

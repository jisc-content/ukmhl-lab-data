ANEURYSM 185 common to both methods, pressure on the artery is relaxed in order to see if there is any bleeding ; if there is, the circulation is commanded once more and additional sutures are inserted. It is very im- portant to obliterate the sac, so as to leave no cavity requiring" drainage. The sac walls are ap- proximated by stout sut- ures which are made to penetrate the deep wall of the sac, and are then passed through its outer wall and the skin over it together, and are tied over a pad of gauze. In some cases it may be possi sac wall, leaving only the After the suture has been completed, thi -I Fig. 68.—Diagrammatic Transverse Secikiv ihr'Ugii AN Aneurysm treated by Matas's Obliterative Method.

Matas suggests that, in a fusiform aneurysm involving a very large vessel, it may be pos- sible to perform a ' re- constructix e ' operation instead of the ' oblitera- tive ' one, when the wall of the vessel is not too much diseased, by sutur- ing the artery wall over a piece of drainage tube, which thus acts as a mould. The tube is re- moved after all but the last few sutures ]ia\-e been inserted and tied over it (see Fig. 69). Thus there are really three distinct opera- tions: (i.) The obhterative, (ii.) the restorative, and (iii.) the reconstructive. Fig. 69.—Diagram.matic Transverse Section of an Aneurysm treated by Matas's Reconstructive Method.

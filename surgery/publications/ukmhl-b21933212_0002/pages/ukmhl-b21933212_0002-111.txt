CHAPTER VIII. 77 AFFECTIONS OF TENDON SHEATHS. INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS. The most important diseases of the tendon sheaths are the inflammatory conditions grouped together under tlie term teno-synovitis. ACUTE TENO-SYNOVITIS. A suppurative and an acute non-suppurative teno-synovitis are met with, and the latter may be of the dry or the serous form. The dry form may be further divided into two groups, namely, the dry crepitating teno-synovitis and tlie plastic teno-synovitis. DRY CREPITATING TENO-SYNOVITIS manifests itself chiefly by crepitation on manipulation. Pain on movement is complained of ; there may also be pain on pressure and some diminution in the freedom of the muscular movements. Sometimes there is slight swelhng along the course of the tendon ; often there is none. When the muscle contracts, a characteristic soft rubbing sensation is felt, very similar to that experi- enced when two pieces of silk are rubbed over one another ; this crepita- tion commences on the second or third day of the affection. The disease usually disappears spontaneously in from ten to fifteen days, but it is very prone to recur. Adhesion of the tendon to its sheath, and conse- quently impaired movement, may occur unless suitable treatment be adopted early. The condition may result from over-use of the tendon, as, for example, in washerwomen, in whom it occurs about the back of the wrist, the tendon sheaths chiefly affected being those of the thumb and the radial extensor tendons. It also occurs in the sheaths of the extensor tendons in pianists. It is sometimes met with in the lower extremity after pro- longed skating or bicycling, when it usually affects the tibials, the long extensors of the toes, or sometimes the peronei. It may occur in the tendo Achillis sheath in soldiers as a result of over-marching. Rheumatism

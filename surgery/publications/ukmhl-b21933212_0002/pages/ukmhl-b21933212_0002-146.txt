112 AFFECTIONS OF NERVES When the Compression still continues. When, for example, the nerve is involved in callus, steps must be taken to relieve the com- pression as quickly as pos- sible ; an incision should be made over the fracture, the nerve exposed above and below the callus, and traced over or through it. The new bone that is exerting the pressure must be removed, but in doing this special care must be taken not to damage the nerve as it runs through the callus. The main trunk and any of its branches, which may have become in- volved, should be followed out and set free, and then it is well to grasp it above and below the seat of compres- sion and stretch it in situ, so as to rupture any new con- nective tissue around it that might exert injurious pres- sure. It is a good plan to wrap as much muscle as pos- sible around the nerve, so as to prevent the callus com- pressing it again. If the cause of compres- sion be a new growth, the growth must naturally be removed. When a simple tumour presses upon a nerve trunk it must be removed without dividing the nerve; if the nerve be embedded in the growth, it must be freed from the growth first, and then the growth is removed. Should the growth be malignant, however, the portion of the nerve imphcated must be cut away and, if the condition of the parts per- mits, immediate suture of the divided ends should be effected by one of methods described below (see p. 119). Fig. 37.â€”Method of Frilling a Nerve imbedded in Callus. The musculo-spiral nerve, which is involved in callus resulting from a fracture of the humerus, is exposed above and below the mass. The callus is then carefully cut away over it until the nerve is free.

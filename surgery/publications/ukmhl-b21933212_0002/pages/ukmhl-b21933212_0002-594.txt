AMPUTATIONS 546 tissues. After this, all the tissues should be taken up down to the bone. When the ligamentum patellae is exposed, it should be divided imme- diately above the tubercle of the tibia and the dissection is then carried upwards all around the bone until the upper margin of the tibia is reached. The knife is now introduced between this bone and the semilunar carti- lages, and made to detach the latter and leave them in contact with the condyles of the femur. The tendons and ligaments about the front and lateral aspects of the joint are divided, when, by increasing the flexion of the limb, the surgeon is able to complete the separation of the semilunar cartilages from the head of the tibia and to divide the crucial and the Fig. 251.-â€”Amputations about the Knee. A. Stephen Smith's ' hooded flap ' method of disarticulation at the joint. In the original operation the incision ran transversely across the front of the limb, and was not notched as depicted above. B. Lister's modification of Garden's amputation. C. Garden's amputation through the femoral condyles. In the last two operations the dotted line indicates the level at which the bone is divided. posterior ligaments. The division of the hamstring tendons and the popliteal vessels and nerves completes the disarticulation. In order to do this the assistant brings the leg nearly into line with the femur, and keeps the flaps out of the way, while the surgeon cuts vertically downwards through the joint. The arteries requiring ligature are the popliteal, which with its vein will be found in the middle line behind the femur, and the anastomotica magna on the inner side of the flap ; a few other liga- tures will be required for articular and muscular arteries. The patella is left undisturbed in the flap. A drainage tube should be inserted at the posterior extremity of the wound and may be removed after two or three days. The limb is placed

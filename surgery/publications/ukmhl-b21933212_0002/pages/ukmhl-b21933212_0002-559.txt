AMPUTATIONS OF THE FINGERS the finger to be removed, flexes it at the metacarpo-phalangeal joint through about half a right angle and, entering the point of the knife just above the knuckle, carries an incision directly downwards over the dorsal aspect of the phalanx nearly to the level of the edge of the web of the finger. Thence the incision passes forwards and very slightly down- wards to the edge of the web. It then runs transversely across the front of the finger on a level with the crease on its palmar surface as far as the C Fig. 231.â€”Amputations of the Fingers.

The oblique section through the latter is shown by the thin dotted line. web on the opposite side, whence it is carried upwards to join the vertical incision from which it started (see Fig. 231, A). This incision should go down to the bone all round. The finger is then fully extended and the flaps are dissected up. If the tendons have escaped division in the first incision, they are put upon the stretch and divided. The base of the phalanx is cleared and the metacarpo-phalangeal joint is opened from the palmar surface by hvper-extending the hnger and putting the anterior ligament upon the stretch; it can then be nicked with the point of the

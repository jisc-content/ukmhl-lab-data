TRANSVERSE FRACTURE OF THE PATELLA 409 to tlic joint, and will consist in careful disinfection of the wound, removal of any loose fragments of bone, and sponging the fractured surfaces with pure carbolic acid, which must not be allowed to run into the joint. The latter is then washed out with sterilised saline solution. The fragments of the patella ma}' be wired if necessary, and one drainage tube inserted into the joint and another between the bone and the skin. After-treatment.—The case must be carefully watched lest sepsis should occur ; if it does, it will be necessary to make free incisions into the joint and irrigate it with saline solution until the violence of the inflammation has subsided. In some cases it may be necessary to excise the joint or amputate the limb. Further details on these points will be foimd under Wounds of Joints (see Vol. III.). VERTICAL FRACTURE OF THE PATELLA. This form of fracture is rare, and generally results from direct blows upon the bone. The separation of the fragments is only slight, and the fibrous structures over them are generally but little damaged. TREATMENT.—What has already been said above with regard to Comminuted Fracture of the Patella applies equally to this form.

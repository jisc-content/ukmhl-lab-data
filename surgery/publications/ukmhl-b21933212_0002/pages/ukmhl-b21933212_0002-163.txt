NEURITIS 129 probably due to extension of the inflammation and the formation of fresh adhesions in and around the nerve. The nerve is exposed by an incision immediately over its course, freed from the surrounding parts and stretched. In a large nerve this is generally performed by the fingers; in a smaller one by introducing beneath it a blunt hook, upon which the nerve is lifted and traction thus exerted. The exact amount of force that it is advisable to employ, so as to stretch a nerve effectually without damaging it, will vary of course with the particular nerve operated upon. In the case of the sciatic, the limb 2 Fig. 43.â€”Stretching the Great Sciatic Nerve without Operation. The toes should be dorsi-flexed to the utmost and the knee kept fully extended while the hip is being flexed. The figures represent the stages in the stretching. may be raised from the table by pulling upon the nerve without fear of doing any damage. The traction should be steady, and should be made in both directions, the peripheral end of the nerve being first pulled upon and afterwards the central; rather less force should be employed in the latter direction. It is common to feel bands of fibrous tissue giving way as the stretching is carried out, and at the end of the operation the nerve will often be found a good deal increased in length, so that it lies loose and flaccid in the wound (see Figs. 52 and 53). After the nerve has been stretched, it is replaced in the wound, which is sewn up without a drainage tube. Special care must be taken to avoid II. K

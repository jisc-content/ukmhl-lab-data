THE TREATMENT OF SIMPLE FRACTURES 275 In fractures of tlie femur, extension may be made either by a weight passing over a puhey, the apparatus toeing attached to the hmb by means of strapping, or by traction appUed from the end of a sphnt Fig. 123.—Pulley Arm pok VVeioht Extension. The apparatus is fixed to the frame of the bed, and can be raised or lowered at wiW, fixed to the limb. In ah cases wliere extension is employed there must be the extending force which pulls the fragment down into position, and also some form of counter-extension to prevent the upper part of the limb and the trunk being displaced. Weight Extension.—In this form of extension a weight is fastened to Fig. 1.14.—SiiKKUP i or use wmi W'EiGiir Kxilnsiu.s. On tlnf riylit is seen tlie strapping, folded into three as described in the text and attached to the buckle of the wooden ' spreader.' the end of a cord attached to the limb and passing over a pulley at the foot of the bed (see Fig. 123). The pulley should be arranged so that the cord, by which the extension is made, lies in the long axis of the limb. The method of attaching the weight to the limb, for example, in the case of a fracture of the shaft of the femur is as follows :—

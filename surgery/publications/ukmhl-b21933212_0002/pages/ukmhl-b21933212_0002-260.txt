220 SURGICAL TREATMENT OF SPECIAL ANEURYSMS brevis, the pronator radii teres, the radial origin of the flexor sublimis digitorum, the flexor longus poUicis, and the pronator quadratus. On its outer side throughout its whole length is the supinator longus and its tendon. In the middle third, the radial nerve is in contact with the artery. On the inner side, in the upper part, is the pronator radii teres, and in the lower part, the flexor carpi radiahs. Superficially the artery is overlapped in the upper part by the supinator longus ; in the lower part it is covered by skin and fascia only. There are two ven?e comites, Fig. 88.—Ligature of the Right Radial in the Upper Third. [PT) Pronator radii teres. (S) Supinator longus. (N) Radial nerve. (A) Radial artery. (SB) Supinator brevis.

At the lower border of the pronator quadratus the artery passes to the back of the wrist, lying upon the external lateral ligament, the scaphoid and the trapezium. It is crossed by the extensor tendons of the thumb, and is covered by the skin, some subcutaneous veins and the terminal filaments of the radial nerve. It turns forwards to pass through the first interosseous space into the palm of the hand, where it forms the deep palmer arch. Ligature in the Upper Third of the Forearm.—An incision is made along the line of the artery, and the interval between the supinator longus and the pronator radii teres is identified. The elbow is then flexed, the

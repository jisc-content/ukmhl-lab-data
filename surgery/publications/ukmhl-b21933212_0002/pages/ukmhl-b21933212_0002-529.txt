In reviewing the position that amputation occupies in surgery at the present time, one cannot fail to be strack by the great changes that have taken place in recent years—changes so profound that it is no exaggera- tion to say that our views on amputation have been quite revolutionised. Greater Deliberation of Present-day Operating.—The first striking change is the entire disappearance of those brilliant operations in which the limb was removed (usually by transfixion or by the circular method) in a few seconds. Thanks largely to the introduction of an^Tsthetics, their place has been taken by more careful, deliberate and elaborately planned operations, in which the chief consideration is not the length of time taken in removing the limb, but the proper formation of a sound stump provided with a sufficient covering of soft parts, and as long as the condition of the tissues will allow. Rapidity of operating is valuable as it minimises shock, but accuracy must not be sacrificed to brilliancy. Infrequency of Amputations.—A second and almost equally striking point is the comparative infrequency with which amputation is now performed. It was formerly the custom to submit to amputation many cases in \\'hich the question does not now even occur to the surgeon, for, thanks to the introduction of asepsis, conservative surgery is carried to a degree formerlj^ undreamt of. In compound fracture, for example, amputation was formerly the mle, but now it is possible to save the limb in

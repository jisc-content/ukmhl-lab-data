226 SURGICAL TREATMENT OF SPECIAL ANEURYSMS downwards from just below the umbilicus. The skin, superficial fascia, and the front layer of the sheath of the rectus are divided, and the posterior layer of its sheath is opened. The peritoneum is then slit up throughout the whole extent of the wound (see Fig. 93). In stout subjects, and in cases in which the external iliac artery is Fig. 95.â€”Suture of an Abdominal Wound in Layers. Second layer.

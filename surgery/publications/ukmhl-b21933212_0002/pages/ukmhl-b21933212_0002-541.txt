METHOD OF PERFORMING A TYPICAL AMPUTATION 493 method as little blood is lost as when Esmarch's complete method is adopted. It is important to remember that the limb should not be kept elevated too long before the tubing is applied, as otherwise the arteries will recover and more blood will flow into the limb. Seat of the Tourniquet.—^The tourniquet should be applied as far away from the amputation area as possible ; if applied too near to the seat of operation it will prevent proper retraction of the muscles, because it binds them to the bone. Moreover, the band is apt to slip off over the flaps when the bone has been sawn. FlC. 221. How TO PREVENT ESMARCh's TubING FROM SLIPPING DURING AN AMPU- TATION THROUGH THE Thigh. Botli the tubing and the strips of bandage with which they are pulled upwards should be disinfected before use. - Material for the Tourniquet.—In the lower extremity, a band of stout india-rubber tubing is the best material for a tourniquet ; the muscles are numerous and fleshy, and considerable force is required to arrest the circulation. In the upper extremity, however, stout tubing may cause undue pressure upon the nerves, and a better plan is to use a broad elastic bandage wound horizontall}' around the limb several times ; this exerts more evenly diffused pressure. The tourniquet, either india-rubber or elastic bandage, should be always sterilised by boiling before use. The chief drawback to the use of the elastic tourniquet is that free and persistent oozing from the stump always follows its removal In most

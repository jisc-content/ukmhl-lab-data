191 CHAPTER XIII. THE SURGICAL TREATMENT OF SPECIAL ANEURYSMS. ANEURYSM OF THE THORACIC AORTA. These aneurysms seldom come under the notice of the surgeon until they project from the wall of the thorax andthreaten to burst through the skin. TREATMENT.—All that can be done to reinforce the medical treatment is to promote coagulation within the sac by one of the methods already described—preferably galvano-puncture or the introduction of Macewen's needles. This, however, is seldom successful in arresting the progress of the disease completely. To some extent, no doubt, this is because the surgeon is seldom called in until a very late stage of the disease has been reached. Distal Ligature.—Some degree of success has occasionally followed ligature of one or more of the large vessels of the neck for aneurysm of the arch of the aorta. Complete cure cannot be expected from this method, however, because the circulation through the aneurysm must remain free in spite of the operation. The vessels on the left side of the neck are usually tied, and the best success seems to have followed ligature of the left common carotid. In some cases the left subclavian artery has also been tied, either alone or in addition to the carotid ; when it is decided to tie both vessels it is well to do it simultaneously. This operation is unsuited for cases in which there is valvular disease of the heart, in which the aneurysm is not definitely sacculated or is very large, and especially when it presses upon the bronchi. ANEURYSM OF THE ABDOMINAL AORTA. TREATMENT.—Here the aid of the surgeon is also sometimes sought. Compression of the abdominal aorta on the proximal side of the aneurysm is seldom feasible on account of the size and situation of the tumour, which most frequently occurs in the neighbourhood of the coeliac

108 CHAPTER X. AFFECTIONS OF NERVES. TRAUMATIC AFFECTIONS. As far as treatment is concerned, the traumatic affections of nerves may be considered under three heads—Compression, Contusion, and Division of nerves. These groups overlap each other considerably both as regards sjanptoms and treatment, but, nevertheless, the subject will be made clearer by treating each independently. COMPRESSION OF NERVES. A nerve may be subjected to so much pressure that its functions are materially interfered with for a time at any rate, and under these circum- stances certain pathological changes occur in it. The nerve may be com- pressed an3Avhere in its course, but, from the point of view of symptoms and treatment, it is only necessary to consider compression affecting the trunk of a nerve or its terminal filaments. The compressing force may be severe, and may produce its results rapidly, or it may be milder, and the results may appear more slowly. The compression may be due to injury or to some pathological process. We shall describe (i) Com- pression of nerve trunks—this will be divided into Traumatic Compression, both rapid and gradual, and Pathological Compression ; (2) Compression of the terminal filaments of nerves. COMPRESSION OF NERVE TRUNKS.—(a) Rapid Trau- matic Compression.—Here the pressure to which the nerve is subjected is severe, and, although lasting for only a short time, may produce profound changes in the injured nerve. It is probable that there is an actual contusion, the pressure of the nerve against an adjacent bone leading either to rupture and disorganisation, or to effusion of blood in and around its fibres ; as an example may be mentioned what is popularly spoken of as ' drunkard's ' or ' Saturday night palsy.' The nerve compressed is generally the musculo-

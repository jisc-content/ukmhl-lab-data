METHOD OF PERFORMING A TYPICAL AMPUTATION 499 until, as its base is reached, everything is being raised right down to the bone (see Fig. 226). When the anterior flap has been raised, it is held out of the way by an assistant, whilst the limb is elevated and the posterior flap is fashioned similarly from without inwards. Some authorities recom- mend that this flap should be cut by transfixion ; this plan is no doubt more rapid, but it has the objection that the muscles are divided on almost the same level as the skin, and therefore there may be difficulty in stitching up the stump. The only situation in which transfixion is really advantageous is a region such as the lower third of the thigh or Fig. 226.—Amputation of the Thigh by means ok Mixed Flaps. The long anterior and short posterior flaps consist of slsin and muscle and are fashioned from without inwards as described in the text. the forearm, where the structures di\'ided by transfixion are mainly tendinous. As a general rule a neater and more satisfactory stump is obtained by the slightly slower but much more careful method of cutting both flaps from without inwards. SAWING THE BONE—After the flaps have been raised down to the l)one they are retracted by an assistant and the periosteum is di\'ided by a circular sweep. A cuff of periosteum (see p. 484) may now be raised if the operator desires. The knife is then laid aside, the heel of a fine-cut saw is pressed firmly over the bone and a groove cut by drawing the saw towards the operator from the heel to the point. W'hile the groove is being cut, the saw may be steadied by pressing the tip of the left thumb KK 2

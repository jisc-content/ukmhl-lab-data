253 DIVISION 11. THE SURGICAL AFFECTIONS OF THE BONES. SECTION I.—FRACTURES. CHAPTER XIV. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. DEFINITION.—By a fracture is understood a sudden solution of continuity in a bone brought about by some form of violence. Before dealing with fractures of individual bones, it will be well to discuss the chief points in connection with fractures in general. CAUSES.—It is usual to divide the causes of fracture into the exciting causes—that is to say, the actual violence producing the fracture— and the various predisposing causes which lead to brittleness of the bones and a liability to fracture upon the application of even a slight degree of force. These predisposing causes are important, because, when they exist, the treatment must be directed to combating them as well as to replacing the fragments and keeping them in position. Exciting Causes.—When violence is applied to a bone, a fracture may occur directly opposite the seat of injury—when the fracture is termed one by direct violence—or it may take place at some distance from the point of application of the force—when it is spoken of as one by indirect violence. The question as to whether a particular fracture is caused by direct or indirect violence is of importance both in prognosis and treatment. As a result of indirect violence, the line of fracture is often oblique or spiral, and there is frequently difficulty in reducing the fracture

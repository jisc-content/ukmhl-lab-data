DISARTICULATION AT THE WRIST-JOINT 517 DISARTICULATION AT THE WRIST-JOINT. This operation is rarely called for. It may be required for bad crushes of the hand and some cases of malignant disease. When amputation has to be done for tuberculous disease of the wrist, it should be performed through the forearm. Disarticulation through the wrist-joint gives a very useful stump, because the forearm retains its power of pronation and supination, while the expanded lower ends of the bones of the forearm give a fair point of fixation for an artificial hand. The operation should therefore be done in preference to amputation through the forearm whenever it is practicable. The shape of the flaps must be governed by the amount of skin available. The best flap is obtained from the palm, but this is not always Fig. 235.—.Amputations through the Wrist-joint. .-1, The modified circular method. B, Amputation by a long pahnar flap. The thick lines sliow tlie palmar, the dotted ones the dorsal incisions. available. An excellent result is obtained by means of the modified circular method, with equal dorsal and palmar flaps. When the tissues in the palm are destroyed, a single dorsal flap may have to be employed. No portion of the bones of the forearm should ever be removed unless it is absolutely necessary ; even the styloid processes of the radius and ulna should be preserved. Above all things it is necessary not to interfere with the radio-ulnar articulation. Modified Circular Method.—In doing the modified circular opera- tion comparatively short flaps will suffice, but these must extend a httle lower upon the radial than upon tlie ulnar side, so as to compensate for the lower position of the styloid process of the radius. The following are the steps of the amputation, which will most usually be performed under

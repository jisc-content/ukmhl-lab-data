536 AMPUTATIONS inwards, and the incision is begun over the tendon of the extensor proprius hallucis and carried over the dorsum backwards and outwards to the outer edge of the tendo Achillis. Then the foot is raised and rotated outwards, and the knife traces out the remainder of the incision, begin- ning once more over the hallucis tendon and running thence over the sole and backwards and outwards to its outer border, and thence along the insertion of the tendo Achillis where it joins the first portion. This incision is carried right down to the bone and the flap thus formed is dissected up, whUe the leg is rotated inwards and the foot held at right Fic. 244.â€”Farabeuf's Sub-astragaloid Amputation of the F'oot. The shaded portions of the foot are those removed. Tlie deeply shaded bones, on the other hand, are those left behind. The thick continuous line is the incision on the side looked at, the interrupted one that on the opposite side. angles to it with its outer surface uppermost. As the flap is raised, the articulations between the os calcis and the astragalus on the one hand, and the astragalus and the scaphoid on the other, are exposed. If the dorsal part of the flap be dissected well back and held out of the way, the joint between the astragalus and scaphoid can be opened, and then, by- depressing and pulling the point of the foot inwards, the knife can be passed between the astragalus and the os calcis, and made to divide the strong interosseous ligament. The insertion of the tendo Achilli? is next divided, and the soft structures are detached from the os calcis, in doing which great care must be taken to keep the edge of the knife close to the bone for fear of injuring the flap. The anterior and posterior tibial nerves should be ])ulled out and cut off as short as possible.

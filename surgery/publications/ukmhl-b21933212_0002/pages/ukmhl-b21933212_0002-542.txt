AMPUTATIONS 494 amputations, however, it is unnecessary to keep the tourniquet in position long enough to produce any lasting paralysis of the vessels, and therefore the objection to its use is not so great in the case of amputation cis it is in various other more prolonged operations. In amputating through the middle third of the thigh the circulation can be readily controlled by means of a stout india-rubber cord, passed around the upper limit of the limb. This, however, is apt to slip off over the flaps after the femur has been divided, and to prevent this from happening it is well to take two strips of sterilised bandage of sufficient length and lay them vertically over the limb, one on either side, and Fig. 222.â€”Method of controlling H/emorrhage in Amputations of the Upper Arm. The rubber tubing is applied in a figure-of-eight around the shoulder, over a pad in the axilla, and is kept from slipping off when the bone is sawn by the slips of bandage passed beneath it front and back, and held as depicted above. then to apply the elastic tube over these. When the tubing is in posi- tion, the pieces of bandage are converted into loops by seizing the two ends, and these are pulled upon throughout the operation by an assistant, and thus the tubing is prevented from slipping (see Fig. 221). The assistant to whom this duty is entrusted may subsequently compress the femoral artery at the groin when the tourniquet is removed, whilst the bleeding vessels are being picked up in the flaps. When the amputation has to be done high up in the arm, the best way to arrest the circulation through the limb preparatory to the operation is to place a sufficiently firm pad in the axilla and apply over it a piece of stout india-rubber tubing in a figure-of-eight, around the

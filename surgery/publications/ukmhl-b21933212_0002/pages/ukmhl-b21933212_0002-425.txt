FRACTURES OF THE SHAFT OF THE FEMUR 383 therefore, for the leg to swing towards the upright pillar and in this way extension is maintained. The heavier the bob of the pendulum the stronger is its tendency to return to the rest point; hence the heavier the limb, the greater is the force, by virtue of which it tends to swing towards the upright pillar, and, therefore, if more extension be required, the weight of the limb should be increased by adding weight to the Fig. 188.â€”Weight Extension for Fracture of the Femur below the Tro- chanters. The extension here is made in the long axis of the femur, which coincides with that of the upper fragment. The limb is not bandaged to the splint. metal frame, and not by making greater tension upon the suspending cord. This splint gives very fair results, and is more comfortable than any other ; the patient can move about in bed to a certain extent, as the splint follows the movements of the body, and he is able to raise himself into the semi-recumbent position without disturbing the fracture unduly. It is the most useful splint for fractures just below the lesser trochanter. It should be kept on for about six weeks and massage may be applied while the limb lies in it. It maj^ be then replaced by a plaster of Paris spica, and the patient allowed to get about on crutches (see P- 373) ; a- month later he will probably be able to walk with the aid of sticks.

AFFECTIONS OF TENDONS 98 Implantation.—When it is impossible to reconstruct the tendon by one of these methods, restoration of function may sometimes be obtained by attaching the distal end of the divided tendon to a neighbouring sound one. For example, when one of the tendons of the flexor profundus digitorum has been divided and a considerable portion of it has been lost, its lower end should be defined and refreshed ; the side of the neighbouring uninjured tendon of the same muscle should then be made raw, and the two tendons united laterally by fine catgut stitches (see Fig. 30). Another way of carrying out the same procedure is to split the healthy tendon, and to insert the distal end of the divided one between the two halves of the split tendon and stitch it in place after paring the former (see Fig. 31). The fingers must be fully flexed so as to relax all tension during union. If the operation be successful, the muscle pulls not only on the uninjured tendons, but also on the newly attached one, and as the function of all four tendons is the same, a uniform flexion of all the fingers is obtained ; the power of flexing the affected finger independently of the others, however, is lost. Transplantation.—Transplantation of tendons has been practised when there is a considerable loss of tendon. A piece is split off from a neighbouring tendon and stitched to each end of the one divided ; or a Fig. 30.—Lateral Suture of Tendons. In this method the two tendons are appHed to one another and kept in position by sutures. The side of the uninjured tendon is made raw to receive the end of the divided one. Fig. 31.—Lateral Implantation of Tendon. The smaller tendon is threaded through a vertical incision in the larger one and is then divided into two flaps wliich are turned upwards and downwards, and sutured in the manner shown.

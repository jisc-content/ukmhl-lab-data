CHAPTER XXVII. 474 DISORDERS OF OSSIFICATION. OSTEOMALACIA. This is a fairly well defined disease which seems to bear some relationship to ovarian activity. It is commonest in pregnant women, especially those in whom the pregnancies have been rapid and repeated. It is rare in men and children. It has been recently observed that there is an increased output of lime salts during normal menstruation, and further it has been observed by Hanau that osteophytes and osteoid tissue occur in the cranial bones of 25-30 per cent, of puerperal women, indicating that there is some relationship between this disease and the ovarian functions. The disease is endemic in the Rhine VaUey, Flanders, Westphalia, and Northern Italy, but cases occur occasionally in other countries. The chief manifestation of the disease is softening of the bones, which affects the whole skeleton and leads to great deformity. There is rare- faction of the bones with loss of calcareous salts; the bones at first are slightly enlarged and the medullary cavity is increased in size and contains red marrow, while the compact tissue becomes much thinned and is often perforated like a sieve. The bones are very liable to fracture, and, short of that, they bend in a most extraordinary manner. The disease usually proves fatal in about two years from its commencement from cachexia, asphyxia or some acute affection of the respiratory organs. TREATMENT.â€”The patient should be put under the best hygienic conditions. Among drugs, phosphorus, phosphoric acid, and more especially phosphate of zinc (a twentieth or a twenty-fifth of a grain in pill three times a day) are advocated, but they do not seem to produce any particular effect. If the patient be pregnant it is well to produce abortion. Improvement has been recently reported from the use of bone marrow in tabloids containing i| grains. Two or more tabloids may be given three times daily. Some observers report good results from oophorectomy.

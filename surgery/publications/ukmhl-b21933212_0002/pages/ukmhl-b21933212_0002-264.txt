224 SURGICAL TREATMENT OF SPECIAL ANEURYSMS it is also crossed here by the vas deferens in the male, and the round ligament in the female. Lymphatic glands lie in front and at the side of the vessel throughout its length. The ureter, descending in the sub- peritoneal tissue, sometimes crosses the artery near its origin. On the right side, the external iliac vein is on the inner side of the artery at its commencement, but inclines behind it as it passes upwards. On the left side, the vein is on the inner side of the artery throughout. Ligature of the Iliac Arteries.—There are two principal methods Fig, 93.—TRANS-PHRnoNEAL Ligature of the Common Iliac Arterv. The abdomen has been opened through a median incision, and the small intestines and sigmoid have been packed off with gauze upwards and to the left, thus exposing the vessel. by which the iliac arteries may be tied, which are termed respectively the trans-peritoneal and the extra-peritoneal methods. The trans-peritoneal ligature is performed by opening the abdominal cavity either in the linea semilunaris or in the middle line, and reaching the artery through the posterior layer of the peritoneum after pushing the intestines out of the way. In the extra-peritoneal method, on the other hand, the peritoneum is stripped up from the iliac fossa, and the vessel is thus exposed without opening the abdominal cavity. The trans-peritoneal method is the better method in the majority of cases; the extra-peritoneal method is only

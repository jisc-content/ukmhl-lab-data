FRACTURES OF THE MIDDLE OF THE FOREARM 351 on cannot exert lateral pressure upon the bones. At the same time the splints must not be too broad, as otherwise the arm would slip about from side to side if the bandages became loose, and thus the deformity might recur. Wooden splints should be cut to the shape of the forearm and should be wide enough to project about half an inch beyond it every- where ; hence they mast be much broader above opposite the bellies of the muscles than about the wrist. The ordinary splint as supplied by instrument makers is not suitable ; it must be cut to fit the arm (see Fig. 168). It is often recomn^ended that a pad should be applied betw-een the bones along the middle of the forearm in front, so as to prevent union Fig. 168.â€”Splints applied for a Fracture of both Bones of the Forearm. of one bone to the other. No pad could separate the bone ends witliout exerting injurious pressure on the circulation. The surgeon must rely for success upon proper reduction and immobilisation of the fracture in the first instance. This is one of the fractures in which an operation should be performed at once, if a stereoscopic radiogram shows that the position is not good. The seat of fracture should be exposed by means of lateral incisions over the radial and ulnar borders of the forearm respectivelv. Upon the ulnar side no important structures need be considered, but upon tlie radial side care must be taken to avoid the posterior interosseous nerve, and lower down the radial. The bones are best fixed by thin plates and screws (see p. 307). Before applying the ])lates care must be taken to see that there is no rotation of one fragment upon the other. The arm is put up midway between pronation and supination (see Fig. 168).

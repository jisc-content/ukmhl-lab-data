AFFECTIONS OF NERVES 140 it is behind the upper part of the brachial artery, but it soon leaves the latter to run in the groove between the inner and outer heads of the triceps along with the superior profunda artery; in this groove it runs round the humerus and pierces the external inter- muscular septum, passing downwards between the supinator longus and the brachialis anticus muscles. Just above the bend of the elbow it divides into the radial and the posterior inter- osseous nerves. The nerve may re- quire exposure either on account of rupture, or of pressure upon it by callus after a fracture, or of neuritis from injury, and it is generally exposed about the middle of the upper arm, at which point it lies behind the humerus in the musculo- spiral groove close to the bone. In the Middle of the Arm. — The best guide to the nerve in this situation is that given by Kocher, namely a line drawn along the posterior surface of the upper arm from a point a finger's breadth be- hind the posterior bor- der of the deltoid, close to the long head of the triceps, down to the tip of the olecranon. The incision begins immediately below the axillary fold, and the interval between the long and outer heads of the triceps is iden- tified and the two are separated down to the bone. The nerve will then be found close to the humerus, between the inner and outer Fig. 51.—^Exposure of the Musculo-spiral Nerve for Involvement in Callus.

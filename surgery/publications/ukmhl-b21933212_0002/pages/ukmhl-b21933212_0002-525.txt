477 ACROMEGALY ACROMEGALY, In this condition the overgrowth of bone commences generally between the ages of fifteen and tliirty-five, and consists in enlargement of the hands and forearms, the feet, the jaw, and sometimes other bones. It is accompanied by mental slowness and often imbecility, wasting of muscles, exaggeration or loss of I'efiexes, and increasing weakness. The bones are more porous than usual. In a large number of cases the pituitary body has been found to be greatly enlarged. The enlargement of this structure leads to expansion of the sella turcica in which it lies, and this can generally be seen in a radiogram. TREATMENT.â€”Good results have been reported to have followed removal of the enlarged pituitary body, but the operation is so severe and the success following it is so uncertain, that the whole matter must be regarded as in a stage at which it is not wise to pronounce a definite opinion. We shall not describe conditions such as Achondroplasia or Gigantism as no treatment is likely to be of any benefit in them.

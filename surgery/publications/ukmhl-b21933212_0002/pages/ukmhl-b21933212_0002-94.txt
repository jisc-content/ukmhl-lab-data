AFFECTIONS OF BURS^ 6o disease of the synovial membrane of the knee is frequently present at the same time. If untreated, a typical ulcer surrounded by a good deal of induration forms in the situation of the bursa. The condition is often symmetrical. TREATMBISTT.—The treatment is that for syphihs (see Vol. I. Chap. XL). TUMOURS. New growths in the walls of bursse are rare. Sarcomata and myxomata are met with occasionally, and at first may be difficult to distinguish from simple enlarged bursae, the walls of which are merely thickened by inflammatory deposit. TREATMENT.—This is similar to that of new growths elsewhere, and consists in complete removal of the tumour.

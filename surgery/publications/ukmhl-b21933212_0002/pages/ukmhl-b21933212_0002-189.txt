INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS 151 In chronic gout, the following formula is advised by Whitla :— B Potassii iodidi . . . . 3ij' Potassii bicarbonatis . . . 3^]. Vini colchici . . . . . 3'j- Aq. camphoras . . . .ad 3xij. M. ft. mist. A tablespoonful three times a day in a wine-glassful of water after meals. The diet of these patients requires careful attention. Fat, starch, and sugar should be reduced to a minimum, and all meals should be light, simple, and easily digestible. For fuller details upon this complex subject, and also for information regarding the question of alcoholic liquors, the reader may with advantage consult the section on Gout in Dr. Burney Yeo's ' Manual of Medical Treatment.' 1 Rheumatic Phlebitis.—Should the phlebitis occur as a complication or sequela of acute rheumatism, or in a person of a pronounced rheumatic tendency, the administration of salicylate of soda and iodide of potassium combined will be useful :— E Potassii iodidi . . . . 3ij- Sodii salicylatis . . . . 3j- Syrupi simp. . . . . gj. Aq. menth. pip. . . . . ad §vj. M. ft. mist. A tablespoonful thrice daily. In the very chronic forms the following prescription is useful :— B Sodii iodidi . . . . 3ij- Sodii bicarbonatis . . . . gss. Potassii bicarbonatis . . . §j. Liq. arsenicalis . . . . 3jss. Dec. sarsse comp. .... ad Oj. (Whitla). M. ft. mist. A small tablespoonful in a claret-glassful of effervescing potash water tliree times a day after meals. Post-typhoid Phlebitis, etc.—In cases occurring after typhoid fever or debilitating illnesses, the administration of tonics, especially iron and arsenic, are advisable ; after the acute inflammation has subsided, change of air is beneficial. When the affection is sub-acute, as, for instance, in gonorrhoeal rheumatism, of which phlebitis is a not uncommon complica- tion, salicylate of soda, quinine, and iron are often of value. The patient, who is generally feeble, requires judicious feeding, and the state of the bowels should be attended to, saline purges being given as often as may be necessary, especially at the commencement of the illness. The general condition must be carefully watched ; should rigors occur, the septic character of the phlebitis becomes apparent, and appropriate treatment should be adopted [vide supra).

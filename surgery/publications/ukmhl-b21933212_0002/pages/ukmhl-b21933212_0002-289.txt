249 ANEURYSMS OF THE LEG AND FOOT Ligature of the Dorsalis Pedis Artery—Surgical Anaiomy.— This artery is the direct continuation of the anterior tibial, and its position is indicated by a hne from the centre of the ankle-joint to the posterior end of the first interosseous space. It is covered superficially by the skin and fascia, and is crossed near its termination by the innermost tendon of the extensor brevis digitorum. Its upper part is beneath the lower edge of the anterior annular ligament. It rests upon the anterior ligament of the ankle-joint, the head and neck of the astragalus, the scaphoid and the hgaments connecting these bones, the internal cuneiform and the ligaments between the inner and middle Fig. 109.—Ligature of the Left Dorsalis]' Pedis. \EH.

The anterior tibial nerve usually lies to the outer side of the artery. cuneiform bones. On its inner side is the tendon of the extensor longus hallucis, and on its outer side is the innermost tendon of the extensor longus digitorum and the anterior tibial nerve. There are two venae comites, one on either side of the vessel. Operation.—The artery may be tied either at the ankle-joint or further down in its course. The foot is extended and an incision is made along a line from the mid-point between the two malleoli to the upper end of the first interosseous space. After division of the skin and fascia the tendon of the extensor longus hallucis will be seen internally with the innermost tendon of the extensor longus digitorum running forwards and inwards on its outer side. The artery hes in the angle formed by these two tendons, and by pulling the latter inwards and outwards, the artery is

ANEURYSMS OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY 215 the subscapularis and the tendons of the latissimus dorsi and teres major. The circumflex and musculo-spiral nerves pass behind this part of the vessel. In front are the skin and fascia, the pectoralis major, and the inner head of the median nerve, which crosses it. On the outer side are the coraco-brachialis muscle and the median and musculo-cutaneous nerves. On the inner side is the axillary vein. The internal cutaneous and ulnar ner\^es inter\'ene between the artery and the vein, the former Fig. 84.—Ligature of the First Part of the Right Axillary Artery. The pectoralis major is divided, exposing the costo-coracoid membrane which has been divided in the same direction, exposing the artery and vein. The vein is shown drawn downwards and inwards by the double hoolc on the right-hand of the figure. To the left of tlie figure the lowermost cord of the brachial plexus is shown drawn up by a single hook. being the more superficial. The lesser internal cutaneous lies internal to the vein. The vence comites of the brachial artery unite to form the axillary vein at the lower border of the subscapularis muscle. Ligature of the First Part.—This may be necessary either because the vessel has been injured lower down or because there is an aneurysm on the lower part of it. In its first part the vessel may be reached either by a transverse incision below the clavicle, \\hich divides a portion of the cla\-icular origin of the pectoralis major, or by an oblique incision running downwards m the interval between the pectoralis major and the deltoid.

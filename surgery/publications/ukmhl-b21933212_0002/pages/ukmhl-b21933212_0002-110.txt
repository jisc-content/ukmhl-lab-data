76 AFFECTIONS OF THE MUSCLES HYDATID CYSTS. Hydatid cysts are not uncommon ; something lils;e 2 per cent, of all cases occur in the muscles. Those most frequently affected are the ad- ductors of the thigh, the trunk muscles (especially those of the lumbar region), and the pectorals. The cyst is usually embedded in the substance of the muscle, and the muscular substance around it becomes thinned, degenerated, and fibrous. The cysts should be opened and the whole cyst wall shelled out. It is not necessary to take away the fibrous wall sun-ounding the true cyst wall, provided that the latter, which lies within the fibrous capsule, be peeled off. If this be impossible, the cyst must be opened freely and drained, and it is well also to scrape the wall. NEW GROWTHS. Like new growths elsewhere, tumours affecting muscles may be primary or secondary. Primary tumours of muscle are rare. The most common are the cavernous angiomata which occur about the masseter, the muscles of the cheek, etc. They are characterised by the presence of an enlarge- ment of the muscle of a soft character, which increases on coughing or crying, and which disappears almost entirely when pressure is made upon it ; it re-appears immediately the pressure is left off. The treatment for tumours of this character is electrolysis (see Vol. I. p. 256). Of other primary neoplasms, lipomata occur within the muscular sheaths, myxomata are met with, and sometimes also sarcomata. Secondary tumours of muscle are more common than primary ones. They attack the muscles by direct extension, as in cases of epithehoma of the hp or tongue, cancer of the breast, stomach, etc., or they may result from metastasis. The treatment is excision, the extent of the operation depending on the nature of the tumour. For example, a lipoma may be shelled out of its sheath, while a sarcoma or carcinoma must be removed along with a considerable portion of the muscle around.

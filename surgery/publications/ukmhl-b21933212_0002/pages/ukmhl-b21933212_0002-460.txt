4i8 AFFECTIONS OF THE BONES After reduction has been effected, the foot should be well inverted, so that the internal malleolus falls into its proper position and the deformity in the fibula is obliterated. It is important to be sure that there is no obstruction to the movements of the ankle, that the internal malleolus is not caught between the astragalus and the lower end of the tibia, and that Fig. 208.—Dupuytren's^Splint. The function of this splint is to overcome the outward displacement of the foot. In A is shown the manner in which the upper end of the spUnt is fastened to the leg so that it cannot slip. A folded handkerchief is applied around the limb on a level with the tubercle of the tibia. In B is seen the method of inverting the foot. The splint may be further secured to the leg by a bandage. there is no tendon or fascia interposed between the articular surfaces. This is readily ascertained when reduction has been effected. When the surgeon is satisfied that the joint is in good position, and that nothing interferes with its movements, the limb should be fixed, with the foot firmly inverted. Splints.—If there be no marked swelling or difficulty in reduction, the simplest plan is to put on a Croft's splint (see p. 266), extending from above the knee to the baU of the toes ; if there be much spasm of the mixscles, it is well to make the splint extend up only to the tubercle of the

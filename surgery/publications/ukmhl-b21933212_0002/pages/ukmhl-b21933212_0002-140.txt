AEFECTIONS OF TENDONS io6 DISLOCATION OF the foot and pressing the tendon into the groove ; the foot is then strongly inverted and brought nearly to a right angle. A firm pad is fixed over the groove so as to prevent the tendon from escaping, and an external poro- plastic splint applied so as to fix the ankle joint. The splint should not be left off for about six weeks, except for passive motion, which is carried out in the same way as after operation, and then the foot and ankle should be strapped for some time, and the patient cautioned to walk about with the foot inverted. THE LONG HEAD OF THE BICEPS gives rise to considerable pain and disability, and the tendon cannot be replaced satisfactorily and kept in position except by means of an operation. Treatment.—In order to obtain access to the spot at which the tendon has slipped oat of its groove (which is usually above the insertion of the latissimus dorsi and the pectoralis major) an incision should be made from the coracoid process downwards along the anterior border of the deltoid, the deep fascia divided, and the muscle pulled to the outer side ; the bicipital groove can be felt and its groove exposed. The tendon is readily replaced and the rent in the sheath closed over it by means of a continuous catgut suture. The arm should be put up with the hand on the opposite shoulder, and the elbow raised, while the hmb is fixed to the chest with a bandage, over which starch solution is apphed. As soon as the wound has healed the patient should be encouraged to move the arm, which may be left loose for the greater part of the day. At night, however, it should be firmly bound to the side in the above position, because during sleep some sudden movement might lead to the escape of the tendon from its sheath once more.

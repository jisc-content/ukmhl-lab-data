ANEURYSM OF THE EXTERNAL UJAC ARTERY 229 through an incision whicli extends from a point inches external to the spine of the pubes, and lialf an inch above Poupart's Hgament to another on a level with, and an incli internal to, the anterior superior iliac spine. The first half of this incision is parallel to Poupart's ligament (see Fig. 97). By this method the artery is freely exposed below, and, should the case be one in which the ligature can be apphed to the lower part of tlie FiC. q8. LlOATURE OF THE LEFT EXTERNAL IlIAC ArtFRY BY ASTLEY CooPER'S Method, (n) Extern.il oblique muscle ; (6) internal oblique parti.nlly divided ; (c) fascia transversalis ; (rf) peritoneum covered with retro-peritoneal fat; (t) external iliac artery in its sheath ; (/) the artery exposed through an incision in the sheath ; (g) genito-crural nerve ; (A) external iliac vein ; (j) spermatic cord. external iliac trunk, tins incision should be used, because it causes the least weakening of the abdominal wall and the smallest amount of disturb- ance of the soft parts. When, however, the artery requires to be ligatured liigh up, or when there is a possibility of the common or the internal iliac recjuiring ligature, tlie trans-peritoneal operation is the better. The muscles beneath the outer part of the incision are retracted or divnded if necessary, and any bleeding points are secured as thev are cut. The transversalis fascia is exposed and divided to the full extent of the

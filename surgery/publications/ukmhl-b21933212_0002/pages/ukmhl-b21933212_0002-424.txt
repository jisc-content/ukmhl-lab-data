The fracture is now reduced and the fragments are kept in position by raising the wire frame with the hmb in it, and suspending Fig 187 â€”Hodgen's Splint. The limb is seen secured to the foot of the wire frame (the shape of which is shown separately in the small figure above) by means of a stirrup secured to the frame by a cord. The method of making the wure frame into a cradle or sling by means of strips of stout flannel is also indicated. These strips are stitched to one side of the frame and then brought round beneath the hmb one by one and pinned to the opposite side.

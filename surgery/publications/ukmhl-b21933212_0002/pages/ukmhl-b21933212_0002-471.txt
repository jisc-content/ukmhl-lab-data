429 SECTION II.—DISEASES OF BONES. CHAPTER XXII. ACUTE AND CHRONIC INFLAMMATION OF BONES. GROWING PAINS. During the growing period, especially between the ages of thirteen and sixteen, young adults often complain of pains of varying intensity in bones and joints due to congestion of the medulla in the neighbourhood of the epiphyses, which are popularly termed ' growing pains.' There may be an elevation of temperature, and the condition is very likely to be confounded with commencing bone or joint trouble. On the other hand, these conditions may be mistaken for ' growing pains.' The diagnosis is soon cleared up, however, because in this condition the pain passes off, and any stiffness of the joint disappears rapidly when the part is kept at rest. Although the pain may also disappear rapidly in true joint disease, the muscular rigidity and wasting persist. A radiogram may be of value in clearing up the exact nature of the trouble. TREATMENT.—A cautious attitude is the safest and it is better at first to treat the case as if it were one of the graver affections of the bone or joint. The patient should be kept in bed, with the limb fixed on a splint. Fresh air, good food, warmth, quinine and alcohol in small quantities are all useful. If the case be one of simple congestion, the pain soon passes off, and no swelling will appear. ACUTE INFLAMMATION. Since a bone consists not only of dense osseous tissue, but also of periosteum and medulla, the inflammatory affections, by which it may be attacked may be divided into inflammation of the periosteum or

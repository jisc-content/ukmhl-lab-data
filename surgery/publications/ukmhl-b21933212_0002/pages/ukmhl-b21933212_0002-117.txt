TUBERCULOUS TENO-SYNOVITIS 83 acid may be resorted to as a preliminary measure. In some cases the villous projections become adherent to the wall, and the surface loses its rough- ness to a considerable extent; but in most cases excision must be em- ployed. In the case of the wrist this operation is difficult. A free vertical / Fig. 21.—Incision for removal of a Compound Palmar Ganglion. This is also the the incision for the radical cure of villous teno-synovitis of the flexor tendons. median incision should be made from the lower third of the forearm to the middle of the palm, the annular ligament divided, and the common flexor sheath carefully defined and clipped away wherever it shows the villous condition. The annular ligament is then united with catgut and the wound closed, a drainage tube being used for some days. Massage and movement are required when the wound has nearly healed. TUBERCULOUS TENO-SYNOVITIS. This affection is met with in two forms ; in the one, the tendon sheath is greatly distended and filled with loose bodies, the so-called ' rice-bodies,' and in the other the chief change is thickening of the tendon sheath without much effusion into the cavity, a condition corresponding to the thickening of the synovial membrane of tuberculous joints. TENO-SYNOVITIS WITH 'RIOE BODIES/—The form in which the synovial sheath is distended, and filled with rice-like bodies.

121 TRAUMATIC AFFECTIONS possible, a decalcified bone tube of suitable size is slipped over one end of the nerve and pushed either upwards or downwards accord- ing to circumstances, so as to leave the cut end protruding for some little distance beyond the end of the tube. The chvided ends are now sutured with fine catgut in much the manner described for primary nerve-suture (see p. Ii8). Around sewing needle is employed, one stitch is passed through the centre of the two portions of the nerve so as to steady them, and then a number of strands of catgut are passed through the sheaths of the two ends and tied. When the in- terval has been thus bridged over, the bone tube is slipped over the catgut and the nerve ends and left there (see Fig. 39). The wound is stitched up without a drainage tube, and the limb is put in a poroplastic splint moulded so as to relax the parts as much as possible. In ten days the skin sutures are taken out, and the limb may be gradually extended, the sphnt being finally left off at the end of six weeks. Massage, galvanism, and pas- sive motion should then be employed either until the functions of the nerve are restored, or until it is obvious that no good results will accrue. In any case many months will elapse before the final result can be ascertained. Nerve-grafting.—Grafting a portion of nerve from one of the lower animals into the gap between the divided ends is very uncertain in its results. The graft itself does not five ; it merely acts as a connecting medium along which the new nerve fibres from the upper end are enabled to reach the distal portion.

FRACTURES OF THE PELVIS AS A WHOLE 363 liable to damage. The shock may be treated on the lines laid down in Vol. I. p. 118, but stimulants should be withheld until it has been ascertained whether the large vessels are damaged. Directly he is seen, the patient should be warned not to attempt to pass water; extravasation of urine, which is an avoidable occurrence, can thus be prevented. A patient whose urethra or bladder is damaged experiences a strong desire to pass water, and will do so unless he be warned to the contrary. The condition of the urethra and the bladder should be ascertained as soon as possible, and, if damaged, these structures should Fig. 175.â€”Fractures of the Pelvis.

As soon as possible a stereoscopic radiogram should be obtained. The patient should be placed upon a firm mattress over fracture boards, with the knees flexed over pillows. If possible the mattress should be so arranged that it is not necessary to disturb the patient for the purpose of defaecation ; either a perforated mattress or one providgd with a removable segment is very useful. A broad bandage of un- bleached calico should be applied firmly around the pelvis in order to prevent the falling apart of the sides of the pelvic girdle. If possible any displacement present should be remedied whilst the bandage is being put on. There may be considerable deformity, the rectification of which is a matter of importance in a female ; permanent pelvic narrowing which would interfere with child-birth might otherwise result. The most severe'f'deformity results from depression of the symphysis pubis ; this is more easily reduced in the female by means

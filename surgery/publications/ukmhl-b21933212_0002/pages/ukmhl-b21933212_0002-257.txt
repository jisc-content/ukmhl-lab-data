ANEURYSMS OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY 217 collateral circulation will be the same as after ligature of the third part of the subclavian. (2) If the third part be ligatured below the circumflex, the collateral circulation is the same as for ligature of the brachial above the superior profunda. (3) If the ligature be above the subscapular and circumflex branches, the collateral circulation is carried on by the long thoracic and intercostals anastomosing with the thoracic branches of the subscapular ; by the suprascapular and acromio-thoracic anastomos- FiG. 85.—Ligature of the Third Part of the Right Axillary Artery, (b) Coraco-braclnalis muscle ; (6) axillary artery ; (c) internal cutaneous nerve ; (d) venae comites ; {<•) median nerve. ing \\'ith the posterior circumflex ; by the suprascapular and the posterior scapular anastomosing with the scaj^ular branches of the subscapular. Ligature of the Brachial Artery—Surgical A natomy.—Tlie position of the artery is indicated by a line drawn from the junction of the anterior and middle thirds of a line connecting the anterior and posterior axillary folds to the centre of the ante-cubital fossa, when the arm is extended and supinated. In front, the artery is overlapped by the inner margin of the biceps and is covered throughout by the skin and deep fascia. The median nerve crosses its centre from without inwards. In the ante-cubital space, the bicipital or semilunar fascia separates it

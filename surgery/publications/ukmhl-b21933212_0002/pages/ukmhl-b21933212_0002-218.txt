AFFECTIONS OF ARTERIES i8o as it is at some distance from it. Moreover, the risk of secondary haemor- rhage and suppuration in the sac is now known to be the result of sepsis and not of the irritation of the ligature. Hence the exact point at which the ligature should be applied depends more upon the anatomy of the part (particularly of the branches arising from the artery) and on the size and condition of the aneurysm, than on any other consideration ; we Fig. 65.â€”Gangrene of the Leg after Obliteration of a Popliteal Aneurysm. The patchy extent of the gangrene is well shown. now apply the ligature at the point at which it iwill nterfere least with the blood-supply to the parts below. The rules formerly laid down as to avoiding ligature oi an artery in the immediate vicinity of a collateral branch, and the exact distance from the aneurysm at which it should be apphed, are also of little value. Formerly it was found that when a ligature was applied in the immediate neighbourhood of a branch, the clot in the interior of the vessel did not extend further up than that branch, and, consequently, if the latter were

251 ANEURYSMS OF THE LEG AND FOOT popliteal space to a point midway between the tip of the internal malleolus and the prominence of the heel. In the middle of the leg the artery may be exposed by an incision behind the inner border of the tibia. The limb is laid upon its outer side, with the knee flexed and supported upon a sandbag, and an m- cision about four inches long is made parallel to the inner border of the tibia and about a finger's breadth behind it. The internal saphenous nerve and vein are generally exposed and must be pulled aside. After the deep fascia has been divided, the inner border of the gastrocnemius comes into view and is drawn back with a retractor.

This is divided in the same direction, when the muscular fibres of the flexor longus digitorum are seen with the tibialis posticus to its outer side, and still more externally the flexor longus hallucis. The artery will be found between the flexor longus digitorum and the tibialis posticus, about an inch and a quarter beyond the inner border of the tiliia. The posterior tibial nerve is on its outer side (see Fig. no). Difficulties.—Two mistakes are often made. Either the soleus is divided too far outwards, and the finger passes outside the tibialis posticus

ANEURYSMS OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY the main trunk, with a disappointing result. Hence, if the artery appear very small, or, if the bleeding or pulsation do not stop when the vessel is tied, the surgeon should suspect the possibility of the artery having bifurcated higher up, and should look for the other branch of the vessel towards the inner side. Ligature at the Bend of the Elbow.—The vessel is tied through an incision slightly oblique from above downwards and out- wards, parallel to and on the inner side of the biceps ten- don, and with its centre op- posite the middle of the bend of the elbow. The median basilic vein with the branches of the internal cutaneous nerve will be seen when the skm is divided and should be pulled inwards, when the bicipital fascia comes into view, nmning downwards and inwards. The upper part of this structure should be di- vided by a vertical incision, but it is usually not neces- sary to divide it completelv. Immediately beneath will be found the brachial artery, and its vens comites, some\\hat overlapped by the biceps muscle (see Fig. 87).

Ligature of the Radial Artery.—Surgical Anatomy.—The position of the artery in the forearm is represented by a line draw n from the centre of the ante-cubital fossa to the inner side of the base of the styloid process of the radius. The artery rests in succession on the tendon of the biceps, the supinator Fig. 87.—Ligature of the Left Bkaciiial .Artery AT THE Bend of the Elbow. The artery with its venae comites is exposed through an incision in the bicipital fascia.

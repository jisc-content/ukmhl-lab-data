AFFECTIONS OF THE BONES 412 line of fracture from below upwards and backwards. In a fracture from direct violence there is only slight displacement, unless the fracture be comminuted; the upper fragment is tilted somewhat forwards while the lower is carried backwards by the weight of the foot. There is usually a good deal of bruising of the skin, which is apt to slough if any pressure be put upon it. This point must be remembered in putting up the fracture. TREATMENT OF A SIMPLE FRACTURE.—When the lower fragment is brought into line with the upper, means must be taken to relax the calf muscles—especially if the fracture be oblique—as their contraction pulls the lower fragment up behind the other, while at the same time the quadriceps extensor cruris is apt to produce a tilting Fig. 205.—' Fracture Box ' or ' Box Splint ' for Fractures of the Leg. The two lateral splints are rolled up in a folded sheet, fastened to the limb by straps and buckles, and the whole apparatus slung to the cradle. A bandage is usually also put on over all. forward of the lower end of the upper fragment, the result being that union occurs with the fragments in bad position and the sharp lower end of the upper fragment may perforate the skin. There is not so much danger of this accident happening as there is when both bones of the leg are broken, as the unbroken fibula acts as a splint. After reduction of the fracture is complete, the limb may be put up in a Maclnt5're's splint, with the heel supported (see p. 414) ; a pad is placed over the tibia a little above the fracture, and bound down so as to keep the upper fragment in position. This pad must not be applied too near to the fracture, as otherwise the skin will be likely to slough from the pressure. If there be any difficulty in bringing or retaining the fragments in proper position, it is well to cut down on the fracture and

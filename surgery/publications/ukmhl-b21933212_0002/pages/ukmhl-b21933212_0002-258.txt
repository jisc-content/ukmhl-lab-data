2i8 SURGICAL TREATMENT OF SPECIAL ANEURYSMS from the median basilic vein. Behind, tlie artery lies successively upon the long and the internal heads of the triceps, the insertion of the coraco- brachialis, and the brachialis anticus. The musculo-spiral nerve and the superior profunda artery intervene between the artery and the long head of the triceps. On its outer side lie the coraco-brachialis muscle, and the median nerve above and the biceps below. On the inner side above are the internal cutaneous and ulnar nerves and the basilic vein, and in the lower part is the median nerve. Two ven« comites, one on each side, accompany the artery, and are connected together by branches which pass across the vessel. Ligature in the Middle of the Arm.—The brachial artery is usually tied ii ah c a e f Fig. 86.—Ligature of the Right Brachial Artery in the Middle of the Arm.

The incision should be about three inches long, parallel to and just below the inner border of the biceps ; the arm should be at right angles to the trunk, and the surgeon should sit between the two. After the skin and fascia have been divided, the edge of the biceps should be freed and pulled upwards, when the artery can be felt immediately beneath the finger. The median nerve will be seen crossing the vessel in front, and when this is drawn upwards, the artery accompanied by a vein on each side will be brought mto view (see Fig. 86). It is not uncommon for the brachial artery to divide into its radial and ulnar branches at this point, or even higher up the arm, and one of these has been mistaken for

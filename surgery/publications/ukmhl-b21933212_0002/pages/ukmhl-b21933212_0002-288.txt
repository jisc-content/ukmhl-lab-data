248 SURGICAL TREATMENT OF SPECIAL ANEURYSMS The only difficulty in the operation is to choose the right inter-muscular septum (viz. the innermost), and not to explore the one between the extensor longus digitorum and the peroneus longus.

Fascia lata. In the Lower Third.—An incision is made in the Une of the artery along the outer edge of the tendon of the tibiahs anticus muscle, which is the first prominent tendon external to the anterior border of the tibia. The skin and fascia are divided, and this ten- don is drawn inwards, whilst the next (that of the extensor longus haUucis) is drawn out- wards ; the artery wUl then be seen, with the anterior tibial nerve to its outer side and rather in front of it (see Fig. 108). The tendon sheaths should not be opened. Collateral Circulation after Ligature of the Anterior Tibial Artery.—This is maintained by the dorsalis pedis anastomosing with the internal and external plantar arteries; by the inter- nal malleolar with the corresponding artery of the posterior tibial; the ex- ternal malleolar with the anterior peroneal and tarsal branch of the dorsaHs pedis ; and by muscular branches which pierce the interosseous membrane.

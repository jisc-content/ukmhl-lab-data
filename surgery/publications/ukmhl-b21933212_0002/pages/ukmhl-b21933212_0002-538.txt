AMPUTATIONS 490 antero-posterior flaps are to be made, the antero-posterior diameter of the hmb should be spanned whilst the lateral diameter is estimated when lateral flaps are to be cut. Having done this, the thumb should be kept stationary, whilst the rest of the hand is rotated upon it, without altering the distance between the thumb and the forefinger, so as to bring the latter vertically below the former (see Fig. 219). The distance thus marked off will indicate roughly the length of the anterior flap, and a third of it that of the posterior. When an anterior flap only is required, the span thus marked out will require lengthening by about a third. THE RACKET METHOD, Many other methods are employed, the one most in favour being the so-called ' racket incision.' In disarticulations at the metacarpo- FiG. 220.—^Types OF Racket-Shaped Incisions. In are seen the primary types, the simple circular incision with the vertical handle. In the leg the incision is transverse to the long axis of the limb, in the thigh it is oblique, b shows the evolution of the ' hooded flap ' (in the leg) and the ' oblique lanceolate ' incision of Kocher (in the thigh) by sloping the incision gradually from the greatest transverse diameter of the racket to the upper limit of the handle. phalangeal joints, for instance (see p. 510), this is a very useful method. The racket incision is really a combination of a circular with a vertical incision, the advantage being that the bone can be cleared considerably higher up than the base of the flap without having to make a second vertical incision. It is, however, much more suited for disarticulations than true amputations, since it is difficult to apply a saw without adding a second vertical incision (see Fig. 220, a).

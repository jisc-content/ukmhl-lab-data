538 AMPUTATIONS it is useful for many cases of tumour of the foot, and for tuberculous disease and severe crushes of the tarsus. It has also been employed for tuberculous disease of the ankle-joint itself, but it is very difficult to remove the disease thoroughly without damaging the vitality of the flap, and it cannot therefore be recommended for these cases. Syme's amputation provides an excellent stump capable of bearing the entire body weight, and easily fitted with an artificial limb. The operation is performed as follows: The preliminary measures for disinfection, recommended on p. 535, are attended to, and a tourniquet is applied around the lower third of the thigh. The patient lies upon his back with the foot projecting well over the end of the table and held by Fig. 246.â€”Syme's Amputation. The thick linrs denote the skin incisions which pass direct from one side to a corresponding point on the other. The dotted line is the level of the bone section when the joint is healthy; should there be disease of it, the section will be entirely above the articular cartilage. an assistant strictly at right angles to the leg. The surgeon marks out the base of his flap by placing the thumb over the tip of the external malleolus and the forefinger half an inch below and a little behind the tip of the internal malleolus. These points are connected by an incision carried vertically down across the sole right down to the bone. It is important that this incision should run vertically downwards and transversely across the sole from one point to the other (see Fig. 246). Should it be made to slope at all forwards into the sole, great difficulty will be experienced during the later stages of the operation in dissecting back the flap. On the other hand, should it be made to slope backwards towards the point of the heel, the flap wiU probably be in- sufficient to cover the ends of the bones. This incision should be made

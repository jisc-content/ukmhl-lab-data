32 CHAPTER III. AFFECTIONS OF THE LYMPHATIC VESSELS. INJURIES. WOmSTDS of the lymphatic vessels only come under notice when the larger trunks are injured. Should this happen in an open wound, there is a free escape of lymph from the injured vessel and the condition known as lymphorrhagia is produced. This may lead to the occurrence of a fistula, from which lymph escapes, and which is very difficult to heal. As a rule, however, although in many operations a large number of lymphatic vessels are divided, there is very little trouble of this kind. The discharge of lymph may be copious at first, but it quickly diminishes, and in about eight days the vessels become sealed and the wound heals. Treatment.—There is nothing special to be done for these cases beyond the ordinary wound treatment, except when the thoracic duct is injured {vide infra). WOUND OF THE THORACIC DUCT.—In these cases there may be a great deal of difficulty in arresting the flow of lymph and getting the wound to heal. The injury is most likely to occur during the excision of adherent lymphatic glands at the base of the posterior triangle of the neck. It is recognised by the free flow of chylous fluid which wells up into the wound. Treatment.—One of two courses may be adopted: (i) The end of the duct may be ligatured, or, as happened in one of our cases in which there was a lateral opening into the vessel, the wound in the duct may be sewn up with fine catgut, or (2) the wound may be left, the skin closely stitched up, and healing by first intention aimed at, a large sponge or sponges being incorporated with the dressing, so as to maintain pressure upon the part ; this pressure should be reinforced by an elastic bandage applied outside the dressing. Although at first sight it may seem a serious matter to tie the duct, experience shows that this is

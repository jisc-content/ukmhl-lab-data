162 CHAPTER XII. AFFECTIONS OF ARTERIES. WOUNDS. Wounds of arteries are generally treated by ligature or some other form of occlusion of the lumen of the vessel, and this is dealt with in connection with the treatment of wounds (see Vol. I. p. io6). Recently, however, it has been found possible to unite the divided ends of large arteries by suture, instead of tying them as would be the ordinary procedure. The results are said to have been satisfactory in some cases ; that is to say, the lumen of the artery has remained patent, the blood has flowed on as before, and the wound in the vessel has healed, instead of a thrombus forming and obliteration of the artery resulting as one would naturally expect. It is very seldom that the opportunity of carrying out such a procedure will present itself. Apart from transverse division of arteries, punctured wounds of large arteries may be treated by arterial suture or arteriorrhaphy. This especially applies to the common carotid artery, ligature of which is very likely to be followed by hemiplegia and death. The technique of the operation is briefly as follows, i As a preliminary Fig. 58.â€”Crile's Clamp for Temporary H-^mostasis.

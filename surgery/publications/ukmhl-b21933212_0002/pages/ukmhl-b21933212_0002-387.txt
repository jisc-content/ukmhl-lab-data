345 FRACTURES OF THE OLECRANON and especially the detached fragment, is oitcn much softer than in recent fractures, and the holes must be bored as far as possible from the fractured surfaces, so as to get a firm hold, otherwise the wires may cut out. Afler-treatment.—This is similar to that described for recent fractures, but greater caution must be exercised in carrying out movement, because of the softness of the bone ; it is also well to put on a splint for a few days. At first the limb should be put up almost straight, but every third day a sUght increase in the flexion may be made. As soon as the arm has been brought to a right angle, the sphnt may be abandoned and a shng substituted. In about a fortnight after the operation, the patient may be allowed to move the arm to some extent ; flexion beyond a right angle should be delayed imtil bony union has occurred, as otherwise the wire may cut through the soft bone. The difficulty in getting a useful arm in cases of ununited fracture serves to emphasise the necessity for immediate operation in recent cases, provided that the surgeon can trust his antiseptic precautions ; should suppuration occur the result is likely to be disastrous. All that can then be done, under such circumstances, is to remove most of the stitches, take out the wire, insert a drainage tube, and thoroughly drain the joint. FRACTURE OF THE CORONOID PROCESS. Fractures of the coronoid process practically only occur in connection with dislocation of both bones of the forearm backwards. An important point in the diagnosis is that, while the dislocation is easily reduced, the deformity recurs immediately. The loose fragment of the coronoid may interfere with flexion of the limb. A radiogram will make the nature of the condition clear. TREATMENT.—The treatment is very chfficult, for union jn-ac- tically always takes place by fibrous tissue. The best plan is to flex the joint fully after correcting the backward dislocation ; this relaxes the brachialis anticus and brings the broken surfaces as nearly as possible into contact. A pad is applied o\ er the olecranon, and then a poroplastic splint should be moulded to the posterior aspect of the limb while it is in the flexed position. Passive motion should be begun in a fortnight and practised daily for five weeks, when all apparatus may be left oft. This injury only gives rise to marked disability when so much callus is thrown out as to form an obstacle to flexion. Occasionally ossification extends upwards in the tendon of the branchialis anticus, and a spurlike process is formed which greatly hampers movement, and may necessitate removal of the offending portion of bone. The best access to the bone is then obtained by lateral incisions, one on either side of the joint, just over or slightly in front of the condyles of the humerus, avoiding the median and the musculo-spiral nerves. The soft parts are peeled off the condvles and pulled forwards from the front of the joint so as to

310 AFFECTIONS OF THE BONES easy if both bones be ununited, but, when the non-union affects one bone alone, the fractured ends, when refreshed, may not come into ap- position on account of the rigidity of the other bone ; if the interval be large the best plan is to divide the sound bone, remove an amount of it corresponding to the in- terval between the frag- ments of the ununited one, and to fix the ends of both bones together by mechanical means so as to prevent lateral dis- placement. When, how- ever, the interval is very small and only one bone is ununited, we would recommend the insertion of bone-grafts between the fragments, as pre- ferable to the division of both bones, because the sound bone acts as an efficient splint. After-treatment.—The wound is closed without a drainage tube and the limb immobilised. The best plan is to incorpor- ate in the dressing splints of sterilised block tin or wire-netting moulded round the limb, in the manner already described for compound fracture, so as to fix the neigh- bouring joints. Further fixation apparatus, for example a Gooch's splint, may be apphed outside these if necessary. The dressing need not be changed until it is desired to remove the sutures, unless it be much saturated with blood. If it be necessary to change it soon after the operation, it is well to give an anaesthetic and to re-apply the splints before the patient comes round from the Fig. 138.—Inclusion of the Musculci Si-.sAi.

FRACTURES OF LOWER END (JF HUMERUS the wrist slung up close beneath the chin. This keeps the elbow still in the fully-flexed position. It is kept in this position lor a fortnight, when passive movement is begun, the acuteness of the flexion being diminished a little by altering the length of the sling. In performing passive movement, the surgeon grasps the elbow witli one hand and with the other flexes, extends, pronates and supinates the forearm to its full extent. This should be done once only and only once a day. Massage may be usefully practised from the first, and may be done twice or thrice daily. Union generally occurs rapidly, and with reasonable care there is A ' B Fig. 154.â€”Methods of putting up Supra-condyloid Fractures of the Humerus. A, the flexed position ; B, the bandage appUcd. no danger of disturl)ing the fragments. Usually a })rolonged period of massage is required, as not only do adhesions occur in the joint, but a considerable mass of callus is thrown out, which for a time interferes mechanically with movement, but which gradually becomes absorbed. Flexion must be maintained for at least three weeks and is then gradually chminished. The object of this is to prevent the formation of callus in the coronoid fossa. Callus may form in the olecranon fossa and lead to some limitation of extension, but this is of less importance than limitation of flexion. An arm that can be moved from fuU flexion to a little beyond the right angle is a serviceable limb, whereas move- ment from full extension up to a right angle means a comparatively useless

AMPUTATIONS 552 the soft parts are rapidly dissected off. It is quite safe to remove the tourniquet at the end of the circular amputation after the principal vessels have been clamped. There is little bleeding in the later stages of the operation, any large vessels divided being clamped at once. It is usual, when the circumstances of the case allow it, to carry the incision right down through the periosteum, which is stripped off from the bone along with the soft parts. The flaps are held well apart, and the head of the bone is rapidly disarticulated and removed. Some surgeons Fig. 252.—Disarticulations through the Hip-joint. A. Furneaux Jordan's Operation.—The circular amputation is done first. The vertical incision is then added, and the upper end of the bone enucleated. The vertical incision is usually about . eight or nine inches long and runs up about two inches above the top of the great trochanter, which is marked by a dot in the figure ; a second dot is placed upon the crest of the ilium. B. Disarticulation by Oval Flaps (anterior racket). The vertical incision is made first and lies over the femoral vessels. The outer portion of the racket incision should cross the limb just below the base of the trochanter. do not saw the bone after the muscles have been divided in the circular amputation, but make use of the intact femur to aid the manipulations necessary for disarticulation. It is immaterial which method is employed. When aU bleeding has been arrested, a large drainage tube leading down to the acetabulum is inserted at the upper and outer part of the wound, and the rest of the incision is sewn up. In order to prevent the dressings slipping, it is well to fasten the inner side to the perineum by

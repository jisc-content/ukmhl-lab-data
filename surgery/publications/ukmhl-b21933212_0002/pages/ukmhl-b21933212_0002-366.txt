324 AFFECTIONS OF THE BONES discontinued until about four weeks have elapsed. During the progress of the case the splint should be taken off daily after the end of the first week or ten days for massage and passive movement. When the fracture does not keep in place satisfactorily after reduction, as may be the case when there is considerable obliquity or much com- minution of the fragments, it will be advisable to expose the fracture and adopt some means of mechanical fixation (see p, 305), if a good result is to Fig. 147.—Weight Extension in Fracture OF THE Upper End of the Humerus. Extension applied tc'hile the patient is in bed. Tlie pulley- arm is attached to the side of the bed and exten- sion is made with the arm somewhat abducted. The counter-extension is made from the end of the bed in a hne parallel with that of the exten- sion ; a large sling or a jacli-towel is used for this purpose, and fixes the scapula and thorax. Fig. 148.—Middeldorpf's Splint for Fracture OF THE Shaft of the Humerus. be obtained. It will only be in cases in which operation is distinctly contra-indicated by age or constitutional disease that any further trial of non-operative measures should be made. In default of operation, continuous extension should be employed. Extension Apparatus.—Extension is often applied by inserting a pad in the axilla, fixing on a shoulder-cap (see p. 322), and supporting the wrist by a narrow wrist-sling. The elbow is left free, in order that the weight of the Hmb may act as an extending force. This method is not, however, entirely satisfactory, and if there be over-riding of the frag-

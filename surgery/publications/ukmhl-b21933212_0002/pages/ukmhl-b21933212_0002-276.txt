236 SURGICAL TREATMENT OF SPECIAL ANEURYSMS cleared, and the arterj'' ligatured, the needle being passed from the inner side. No drainage tube is required, and the limb is treated in a similar manner to that after ligature of the common trunk. The artery usually' lies somewhat in front of the vein, with the long saphenous nerve on its outer side. Collateral Circulation after Ligature of the Femoral Artery.—(i) After ligature of the common femoral the circulation is maintained by the ana- stomosis of the internal with the external pudic ; the gluteal and the sciatic with the ascending branch of the external circumflex, the internal Fig. 102.—Ligature of the Left Superficial Femoral at the Apex of Scarpa's Triangle, (a) Anterior crural nerve ; (6) long saphenous nerve ; (c) femoral artery ; [d) cutaneous nerves; {e) sartorius. circumflex and the superior perforating ; the obturator with the internal circumflex ; the circumflex iliac with the external circumflex ; and the comes nervi ischiadici with the perforating branches of the profunda. (2) After ligature of the superficial femoral, the circulation is carried on by the external circumflex anastomosing with the anastomotica magna, the lower muscular branches of the femoral, and the superior articular branches of the popliteal ; the perforating branches, and the termination of the profunda with the muscular branches of the femoral and popliteal, and the superior articular branches of the latter vessel.

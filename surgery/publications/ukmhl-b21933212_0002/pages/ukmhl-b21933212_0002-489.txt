443 CHAPTER XXIII. NECROSIS : PHOSPHORUS NECROSIS. Necrosis of the bone follows acute suppurative osteo-myelitis and periostitis, and may also result from tuberculous disease, syphilis, or the action of phosphorus. We shall only consider here the necrosis which follows acute osteo-myelitis and the form resulting from the action of pliosphorus. NECROSIS FOLLOWING ACUTE OSTEO-MYELITIS. Characters of the Sequestrum.—The sequestrum presents the character of normal bone which has died before there has been time for the inflam- mation to produce any alteration in it. It is usually the compact tissue that dies, and the sequestrum may consist of the whole thickness or only part of this. Towards the periphery the bone is pitted, portions of living bone being separated with the periosteum. Separation of the Sequestrum.—Sooner or later a piece of dead bone must become separated from the living portion, and the process of separa- tion varies in rapidity according to the bone affected ; the process of separation may take from six weeks to six months. While separation is going on, condensation of the bone around takes place, and new bone is rapidly formed from the periosteum and may progress to such an extent in the long bones of young persons that the dead portion becomes enclosed in a thick shell of bone before complete separation has taken place ; openings called ' cloacae ' leading to the sequestrum are, however, left here and there in the new bone. In old people there is rather a stalactitic formation aroimd the necrosed fragment than a true enclosure by bone. In the Hat bones, such as the skull, the production of new bone is not nearly so marked, and there is seldom anything like complete enclosure of the dead fragment in a bony cavity. The result of this formation of new bone is that the necrosed bone can rarely be got rid of without operation. Sometimes small fragments become broken off and are pushed to the surface by the granulation

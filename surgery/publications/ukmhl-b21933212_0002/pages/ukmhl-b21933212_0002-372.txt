330 AFFECTIONS OF THE BONES see whether the ends of the bones remain in proper position. If there be any serious over-riding, the fracture should be cut down upon and the bones fastened together. The incision will vary with the position and the direction of the fracture, which can always be ascertained mth great exactitude by means of a stereoscopic radiogram ; it will generally be vertical, but, if preferred, a flap may be raised on the outer side of the arm. After the soft parts have been divided, the triceps is separated from the brachialis anticus and the deltoid, and the fractured ends are Fig. 152.—Apparatus for Fractures of the Shaft of the Humerus. In the right- hand figure is seen tlie first stage : anterior, posterior, and internal straight splints are applied. In the left-hand figure a shoulder-cap, prolonged downwards into an external angular splint, has been put on over these. The forearm is shown with its long axis parallel to the antero-posterior plane of the body. The apparatus is completed by a wrist-sling. exposed, got into position and fastened together, preferably by one or two of Lane's plates. Care must be taken to avoid damage to the musculo- spiral nerve. The limb is put up as for a simple fracture. Injury to the Musculo-spiral Nerve.—When there is evidence of injury to the musculo-spiral nerve at the time of the accident, and when no sign of recovery is apparent in the course of a few days, the fracture should be exposed and the condition of the nerve ascertained. If the latter be torn, the divided ends should be brought together and sutured (see p. 117) ; if it be merely bruised and the sheath distended with blood, the

CHAPTER XVIII. .362 FRACTURES OF THE PELVIS. These injuries are generally of a serious character on account of the lesions of important organs that so often accompany them. They are best grouped into fractures of the pelvic girdle as a whole and fractures of the individual components of the pelvis. FRACTURES OF THE PELVIS AS A WHOLE. Fracture of the pelvic girdle is commonly caused by a heavy body compressing and crushing the pelvis between it and the ground, or some other unyielding structure. The fracture is often bilateral; it may be situated on either side of the symphysis, or just outside the symphysis on one side and close to the sacro-iliac synchondrosis on the other. The fracture outside the symphysis generally passes through the horizontal ramus of the pubes and the ascending ramus of the ischium, which are the weakest spots in the pelvic girdle (see Fig. 175). One portion of the broken pelvis is often driven inwards and damages the parts immediately beneath. The structure most commonly involved is the urethra, the condition of which must be investigated in every fracture of the pelvis; the laceration is generally in the membranous portion., and the urethra may be torn across completely or partially. This injury is dangerous, as it may be followed by extravasation of urine, and it is, therefore, of the highest importance to ascertain its presence and to adopt appropriate treatment without delay ; it is generally indicated by bleeding from the external meatus. The bladder is also frequently injured, especially if it be distended at the time of the accident. The rectum or the vagina, and the femoral or the Uiac vessels, may also be lacerated. TREATMENT.â€”When the pelvic girdle is fractured, the first points requiring attention are the shock, which is always present and is generally very severe, and the condition of the structures which are

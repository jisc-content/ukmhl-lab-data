FRACTURES OF THE MIDDLE OF THE FOREARM 349 the insertion of the pronator radii teres muscle. In tlie former variety the upper fragment will be fully supinated by the biceps and the supinator brevis muscles, and also somewhat flexed by the former. The lower fragment will be pronated by the two pronator muscles, and drawn inwards towards the ulna. If, however, the fracture be below the insertion of the pronator radii teres, the upper fragment will be midway between pronation and supination, while the lower will be completely pronated and drawn inwards towards the ulna. TREATMENT.—Of Fracture above the Insertion of the Pronator teres.—The elbow must be flexed to a right angle and the forearm fully supinated. An anterior rectangular splint and a posterior straight one are applied, the latter reaching from the olecranon to the back of the hand. A pad should be placed over the lower end of the upper fragment, so as to keep it back, and the elbow and forearm should be supported by a large sling.

CHAPTER V. 52 AFFECTIONS OF FASCIA. TRAUMATIC AFFECTIONS. Injuries to the fasciae are common and vary in degree from a simple ' sprain' to an actual rapture. RUPTURE. This is the most important of the injuries of fasciae ; for example, in the case of the foot, an overstretching or a sudden descent from a height on to the sole may lead to rupture of a portion of the plantar fascia. The injury is accompanied by great pain at the time, and some- times imperfect union of the ruptured fascia may lead to much pain and tenderness whenever the patient bears his weight upon the foot. TRBATMBISTT.â€”The main object must be complete rest, so as to allow the ruptured fibres to unite. When the plantar fascia has been rup- tured, the foot should be put up in plaster of Paris, with the instep fully arched by bending the toes downwards, so as to relax the fascia as much as possible. This casing should only be kept on for about a fortnight; if it be kept on too long, the fascia is apt to contract, and there may be difficulty in obtaining free extension of the foot afterwards. When the plaster has been removed, care must be taken to prevent any sudden strain or great weight being thrown upon the arch of the instep for some time. Massage is useful. CONTRACTIONS. These may result from a disease, such as gout, or may be due to repeated, long-continued, and severe pressure or to prolonged immo- bilisation of the hmb in a faulty position. The most marked example of a contraction of the fascia due to disease is that known as Dupuytren's contraction of the palmar fascia, which is frequently associated with gout

507 CHAPTER XXX. AMPUTATIONS IN THE UPPER EXTREMITY. AMPUTATIONS OF THE FINGERS. General Considerations.—The principal point that the surgeon has to settle belorc he proceeds to amputate a linger is whether it is advisable to save a jihalanx or a portion ol a phalanx, or whether the amputation should be performed at the metacarpo-phalangeal joint and the entire finger remox ed. It is very important to retain even a small portion of a phalanx in most of the fingers—particularly the index and little fingers—pro\'ided tliat the flexor and extensor tendons can he made to act upon it. This can always be done in aseptic cases by securing the end of the divided tendon either to the orifice of the sheath, or to the periosteum in its vicinity, when the amputation is done above i the centre of the middle phalanx and therefore above the insertion of the flexor tendons. DISARTICULATION OF THE TERMINAL PHALANX. When only the last phalanx is diseased there is no dispute as to the advisability of retaining the rest of tlie finger, since the insertions of the flexor and extensor tendons are not completely divided in the amputation, and the movement of the inter-plialangcal joint is tlierefore not inter- fered with. DISARTICULATION BY A LONG- PALMAR FLAP.— The Ijest method of removing the terminal phalanx is by means of a long anterior flap. This is, in fact, the only plan by which sufficient skin can be obtained to cover the head of the second phalanx without tension. More- over the palmar flap is thick and well endowed with tactile sensation, and the cicatrix lies upon the dorsal aspect of the finger out of the way of pressure. ' The terms above and beloiv are used in the upper extremity in a sense synonymous with the adjectives proximal and distal respective!}'. Thus ' above the centre of the middle phalanx' means ' on the proximal side of the centre,' etc.

250 SURGICAL TREATMENT OF SPECIAL ANEURYSMS at once exposed with the anterior tibial nerve upon its outer side (see Fig. 109). Ligature of the Posterior Tibial Artery.—Surgical Anatomy.— This vessel is placed between the superficial and deep calf muscles, to the latter of which it is closely connected by the deep transverse fascia. It commences on a level with the lower part of the tubercle of the tibia, and bifurcates into the internal and external plantar arteries on a level with a line drawn from the tip of the internal malleolus to the centre of the convexity of the heel. As it passes downwards, the artery inclines Fig. 110.—Ligature of the Right Posterior Tibial in Upper Third. S. Soleus, showing cut surface. A. Posterior tibial artery. V. Venae comites, TP.

It is covered by the special deep fascia which binds down the deep muscles, and in the upper part by the gastrocnemius and the soleus, with the plantaris between them. The lower half of the artery is superficial, and is covered by the skin and fascia, except at its termination, where the internal annular ligament and the origin of the abductor hallucis cover it. The posterior tibial nerve is at first on the inner side; it then crosses the artery about an inch from its commencement, and for the rest of its course lies on the outer side. There are two venae comites, one on each side of the vessel ; they anastomose freely across it. The course of the artery is indicated by a line from the centre of the

AFFECTIONS OF THE BONES 442 After-treatment.—The limb should be placed on a splint and kept at rest for three or four weeks. Unless rest be enforced, the delicate clot which fills up the cavity is apt to break down. For the same reason the patient should not be allowed to walk until two months have elapsed, when the lower extremity is affected. These operations should be conducted strictly aseptically : were sepsis to occur very grave suppura- tive osteo-myelitis or periostitis might ensue. This treatment is the best in all cases of inflammation limited to a portion of the bone occurring in young people. When the inflammation affects the whole bone, the results are not so satisfactory, as a very exten- sive operation must then be done, a groove being made throughout the whole bone, and much periosteum taken away. In Old People.—When the affection is extensive and when it occurs in old people, it is a question whether the line of treatment recommended above is allowable or will suffice. When the whole of a bone is involved, the periosteum can only be removed from one side and there is no guarantee against recurrence, because a large portion of the bone will not have been touched. Amputation.—Cases occur in which the pain is so excessive and long continued, and leads to so much agony and loss of sleep, that the patient will submit to anything rather than allow it to go on. In old people it then becomes a question whether amputation will not give a better result when a large area of bone is involved. Amputation will certainly cure the disease—unless neuritis has been set up—and there will be complete relief of pain, and absence of recurrence after an operation which, in old and feeble patients, is less dangerous and is followed by a much more rapid recovery than that just described.

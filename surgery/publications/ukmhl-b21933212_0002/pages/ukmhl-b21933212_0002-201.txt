163 WOUNDS on a temporary ligature (see"Vol. I. p. 106) or by digital pressure. It is generally agreed that coagulation, followed by complete obliteration of the lumen of the vessel, will inevitably follow if any foreign body or even any rough surface projects into the blood-stream. Hence in sutur- ing, the object is to approximate the inner surfaces of the intima on each side of the wound, so that the wall of the artery is quilted up (see Fig. 59), Fig. 59.â€”Arteriorrhaphy for Partial Division of an Artery. The upper figure shows how the deeper or quilting suture is put in and the method of securing it against gaping by carrying the needle back every third stitch. In the figure the needle is represented in the act of doing this. In the lower figure the second or running suture has been put in over the first. and the suture quilting it up is buried between the two surfaces out of contact with the blood-stream. The sutures are of the finest silk obtain- able, threaded on the finest possible round needles ; each suture should be drawn through sterilised vaseline before use, so that the hole in the arterial wall may be caulked, as it were, and leakage through the stitch holes prevented. Figs. 59 and 60 show how the sutures are inserted both for an incomplete and a complete division of an artery. This operation in either of its forms can only be called for very rarely. Moreover, it is not certain that it averts occlusion of the vessel in any case. M 2

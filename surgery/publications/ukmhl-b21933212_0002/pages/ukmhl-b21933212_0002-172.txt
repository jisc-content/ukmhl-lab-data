AFFECTIONS OF NERVES 134 lamina divided with the one immediately above it (see Fig. 49). In order to facilitate the turning back of the laminae, it is well to cut away the spinous process of the vertebra immediately above the uppermost of the detached laminae. Opening the Dura.—After the vertebral canal has been opened, a quan- tity of fat containing a large plexus of veins is found Ipng immediately over the dura mater. This should be carefully opened in the middle line with as little damage to the veins as possible and slit up through- but the whole extent of the wound, with fine scissors; the edges may be held apart either by toothed forceps, or by silk sutures passed through them (see Plate I.). Care should be taken to prevent the escape of the Fig. 48.—Laminectomy Saws. The lower one has a fine blade adjustable at any angle and is very useful for work in the lumbar region. cerebro-spinal fluid in any quantity by keeping the head hanging down, in order to allow the cerebro-spinal fluid to collect in the skull. The nerve roots that are to be resected, having been identified, are divided close to the spinal cord, turned outwards, and as much as possible removed. Great care must be taken to avoid injuring the anterior roots, which would entail motor paralysis. All bleeding is arrested, and the incision in the dura mater is closed completely by fine catgut sutures. If the lamina have been turned back they are replaced, and the skin wound is sutured. There is no need to fasten the laminae in place by sutures or other contrivances. After-treatment.—A large mass of dressing is put on after the wound has been sewn up, and a large moulded shield of poroplastic

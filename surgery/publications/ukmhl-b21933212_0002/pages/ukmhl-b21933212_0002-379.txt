CHAPTER XVIL FRACTURES OF THE FOREARM AND HAND FRACTURES OF THE OLECRANON. This accident is generally caused by direct violence from falls upon the point of the elbow, the olecranon coming into violent contact with the ground. It may occur, however, from muscular action alone, the olecranon being snapped off by the sudden contraction of the triceps when the arm is bent at right angles. The fracture usually occurs near the base of the process, but in some cases the tip alone may be broken off, while in others the fracture runs obliquely from below upwards and forwards into the joint near the front of the greater sigmoid cavity. The process is generally sepa- rated completely, but the fibrous expansion of the triceps and anconeus muscles over the back of the bone may remain intact, and then only slight separation of the fragments occurs. When tlie tip of the olecranon is broken off and the fascia is torn, the small piece of bone is often drawn up the arm for a considerable distance. In fractures in the usual situa- tion, near the base of the process, the amount of separation depends upon how far the fibrous tissues are intact ; in those still lower down, in whicli a part of the curved articular surface of the ulna remains in 337 ^ Fig. 156.—Diagram indicating the Condition of THE Parts in a Fracture of the Olecranon. «, The torn fascia turned in over the upper frag- ment ; b, ditto over the lower fragment ; c, bursa torn open and filled with blood.

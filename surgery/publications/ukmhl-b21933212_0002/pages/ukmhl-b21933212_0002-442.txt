AFFECTIONS OF THE BONES 400 forced onwards. A small vertical incision should be made through the fibrous structures down to the bone at the point where the bradawl is to be introduced, and each side of this incision should be seized by a pair of catch forceps, so that the edges of the aperture can be held aside, and thus the end of the wire does not get entangled and the opening of the drill hole is not lost (see Fig. 197). The instrument should be entered at the centre of the anterior aspect of the bone, as far away from the fractured surface as possible, and driven obliquely through it, so that the point will emerge just in front of the articular cartilage. Fig. 197.—Wiring the Patella. Drilling the lower fragment: The catch-forceps are seen retracting the edges of the slit in the soft parts over the bone. The wire has been passed through the upper fragment. For the sake of clearness the fingers which push up and steady the lower fragment while it is being drilled are not shown. Passing the Wire.—After the upper fragment has been bored in this manner, a piece of silver wire, about a tenth of an inch in thickness (known as No. 4 French catheter gauge), and quite soft and flexible, is passed through the hole. The point on the fractured surface of the lower fragment corresponding to the point of emergence of the wire through the upper one is then carefully ascertained, and a drill is driven down- wards and forwards from this point through the lower fragment until it emerges from its anterior surface just at the attachment of theligamentum patellae. At the point where the drill emerges, the soft parts are divided vertically and the edges of the incision are caught and held aside with

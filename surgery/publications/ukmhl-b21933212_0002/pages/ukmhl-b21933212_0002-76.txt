42 CHAPTER IV. AFFECTIONS OF THE LYMPHATIC GLANDS. WOUNDS. Wounds of lymphatic glands are unimportant, and demand no special treatment. INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS. These may be divided into septic adenitis, acute and chronic ; the various forms of venereal adenitis ; and tuberculous disease of glands. ACUTE ADENITIS. Acute adenitis, with or without suppuration, is a very common affection, infective material being transported by the lymphatic vessels to the glands from all sorts of injuries and diseases of the skin. When this infective material contains pyogenic organisms, acute suppuration of the gland is very apt to follow. Noticeable lymphangitis is not necessarily present, and the adenitis may occur some time after the wound at the site of infection has healed, a small scar being left to indicate its presence. In these cases the gland, which is at first enlarged, reddish and firm, becomes soft and friable, and generally contains a number of foci of suppuration. Peri-adenitis rapidly occurs, the pus escapes through the capsule of the gland into the tissues around, and then, as in other acute abscesses, gradually spreads towards a free surface. When the abscess is opened, portions of the gland are usually found at the bottom of the wound, and if these be examined, independent foci of suppuration can often be seen in them. SYMPTOMS.â€”The symptoms of acute adenitis are those of acute inflammation in general, with the addition of the local symptoms due to the affection of the glands. An acute aching pain is the first symptom, and a single gland is usually affected at first, but later on others in the

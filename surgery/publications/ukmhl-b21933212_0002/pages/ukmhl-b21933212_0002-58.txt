26 CHAPTER 11. AFFECTIONS OF THE NAILS. HYPERTROPHY. In this fairly common affection the nail becomes thickened and marked by transverse depressions, while its tip becomes unduly curved. In old people the nail of the great toe and sometimes, to a lesser extent, those of the others may assume the shape of a horn, the point of which turns over towards the sole or curves round and threatens to grow into the nail matrix or the free end of the toe. This affection often results from inflammation or injury, and is called onychia gryphosa. TREATMENT.—When a nail that is the subject of onychia gryphosa assumes the shape of a horn, it must be carefully pared, as otherwise its tip will grow into the matrix and cause ulceration. When the horn is very massive and dense, the entire nail and its matrix may require removal. INJURIES. CONTUSIONS.—Contusions of the nails are often followed by separation of the nail from its bed. The usual effect of the contusion is to cause haemorrhage between the nail and the matrix ; when the latter has been badly contused, and blood is seen as a black mass beneath the nail, separation of the latter can sometimes be prevented by making a hole through it over the haemorrhage so as to allow the blood to escape. This is easily done by scraping with a piece of glass or the edge of a knife until the nail is thin enough to permit of the introduction of one blade of a pair of sharp-pointed scissors. The operation is quite painless; a small antiseptic dressing should be applied to prevent the occurrence of suppuration beneath the nail.

532 CHAPTER XXXI. AMPUTATIONS IN THE LOWER EXTREMITY. AMPUTATIONS OF THE TOES. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.â€”These operations are called for under circumstances similar to those demanding amputation of the fingers, but whereas in the fingers it is important to preserve all the bone that can be retained safely, in the toes it is best to remove the entire phalanx instead of leaving part behind. Except in the case of the great toe, a portion of a toe is of no use to the patient. On the contrary it is likely to become drawn up so that it presses against the boot and gives rise to pain and ulceration. As long as the heads of the metatarsal bones are left and the tread of the foot is unimpaired, the loss of one or indeed several toes is a matter of no great importance. In the case of the great toe, however, the contrary is the case. Through it a great portion of the weight of the body is transmitted to the ground, and it is therefore important to save even a small portion of the first phalanx. But if this be done, it is essential that the tendons should be stitched to the periosteum or the edge of the tendon sheaths in the manner described for removal of portions of the phalanges of the fingers (see p. 510). The skin of the toes in the region of the naUs is difficult to disinfect thoroughly, and special care will have to be taken in the purification in all these operations. It is a good plan to keep on a wet gauze compress of a I in 2000 corrosive sublimate or i in 40 carbolic acid solution, covered up in mackintosh or jaconet for at least twelve hours before the operation. The methods of amputation for the toes are identical with those for the fingers (seep. 506). The incisions are illustrated in Fig. 243, A. The metatarso-phalangeal joint is relatively higher above the web than the

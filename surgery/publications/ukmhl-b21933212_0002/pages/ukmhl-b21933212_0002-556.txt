5o8 AMPUTATIONS In performing the operation the surgeon stands in front of the patient, while an assistant, standing facing him, gi^asps the other fingers, flexes them, and pulls them away from the affected member, so as to leave the finger to be operated on as free as possible. The surgeon takes the tip of the finger in his left hand, with the thumb upon the nail and the fore- finger beneath the pulp, and flexes the last joint to about a right angle. Then, with a straight, narrow bistoury about two inches in length, a Fig. 230.â€”Amputation of the Terminal Phalanx of a Finger. A shows the position of the limb when the transverse dorsal incision is made. The next stage is shown in B where the palmar flap is being fashioned. transverse incision is made across the dorsal aspect of the distal joint, about a twelfth of an inch below the prominence, keeping the cutting edge of the knife at right angles to the skin. This incision should go direct into the articulation, dividing the lateral ligaments (see Fig. 230, A). The joint is then still further flexed and the terminal phalanx pulled forwards, while the knife is insinuated behind its base and made to fashion a long palmar flap by keeping the blade parallel to, and in close contact with, the palmar surface of the bone as the knife is carried down

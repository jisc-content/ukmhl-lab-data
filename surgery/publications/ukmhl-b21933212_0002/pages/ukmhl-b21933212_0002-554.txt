AMPUTATIONS 5o6 CONICAL STUMP.—The so-called conical stump may result from three causes. In the first place the flaps may be so badly planned at the time of the operation that they can only be made to meet with difficulty over the end of the bone, the result being that the skin becomes more and more stretched over the end of the bone as the muscles waste, and the stump therefore becomes conical. Secondly, the condition may result from excessive wasting and contraction of the muscles after an amputation in which the flaps have been accurately fashioned at the time of the operation ; this generally occurs in very muscular subjects in whom suppuration and granulation have occurred. Lastly, it not infrequently happens that a perfectly successful amputation is performed in young subjects, but the stump gradually becomes conical. This appears to depend on want of proper relation between the development of the soft parts and the growth of the bone, the latter stmcture growing out of all proportion to the former. Treatment.—It is generally sufficient to open the wound, and to remove as much bone as may be necessary to make a satisfactory stump. When the conical condition is produced by excessive growth of the bone it may be necessary to have recourse to operation more than once, for the stump may again become conical after a time. Hence, in operating on a conical stump for the first time, it is well to excise what might at first sight appear to be an unnecessary amount of bone, with a view of obviating the necessity for a second operation for the same condition. The amount of bone removed will vary with the age of the patient ; when he is approaching the period at which growth is complete, it will not be necessary to remove as much as when he is younger, and when the bone may therefore be expected to grow considerably.

513 AMPUTATIO?^S OF THE FINGERS must be taken not to commence the incision above the joint hne, other- wise there wih be insufficient covering for the large articular end of the metacarpal. When it is desirable to remove the head of the metacarpal bone as well as the finger, the line of section through the bone should be obliquely downwards and to the opposite side. It is then also well to slope off the angle of junction between the oval of the racket and the handle, and thus to convert the incision into a long oblique one, in preference to the A B Fig. 232.â€”Amputations of the Index and Little Fingers. .4, Incisions for Farabeuf's amputation at the second and fifth metacarpo-phalangeal joints.

The dotted line shows the line of section through tlie latter. typical racket-shaped incision (see Fig. 232, B). This gives a more sightly scar. REMOV.\L OF A METACARP.\L BONE. Should it be necessary to remove the metacarpal bone as well as the finger, this should be done if possible without opening the carpo-metacarpal articulation. Generally it will be sufticient to divide the bone just below its base, and this can be done by extending the vertical incision upwards. The sides of the bone can then be cleared and the shaft divided at the desired spot, when the anterior surface of the bone can be cleared by pulling it forcilily backwards.

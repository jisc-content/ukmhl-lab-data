531 REMOVAL OF THE SCAPULA catgut in the manner recommended for suture of muscles (see p. 64). The union of these two muscles is of great importance to the sub- sequent usefulness of the arm. If the rotators of the humerus have been divided close to the scapula, they may be stitched to the serratus magnus in the same manner, but this is not of so much consequence, because they readily form adhesions to the scar, vvhicli gives them a more or less fixed point to act from. After-treatment.—A large drainage tube should be inserted at the lower angle of the wound, and moderately firm pressure is applied over tlie flaps to prevent accumulation beneath them. The arm must be pushed up against the acromion and supported by a suitable sling, a pad being placed in the axilla to throw the head of the bone away from the side. This support to the arm must be continued for three or four months after tlie wound has healed, so as to allow the parts to become consolidated before the weight of the limb is allowed to tell upon them. Passive movement of the upper extremity should be begun in about three weeks, when the patient should also attempt active movement. Results.—The results obtained are extremely good, particularly when the acromion process is left. As a rule all underhand movements are perfect and the most complicated manipulations can be performed ; overhand movement, however, is practically never regained. M M 2

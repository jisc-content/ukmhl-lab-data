CHAPTER XXVI. RICKETS: SCURVY-RICKETS. RICKETS. Rickets may be defined as a disease of the period of growth associated with general disturbance of nutrition and marked by alterations in the bony tissues and deformities of the skeleton, as well as by various internal disorders. Children may be born with rickets (the so-called ' foetal rickets '), but the disease generally commences during infancy, and begins to show its effects on the skeleton during and after the second year. In some cases, however, rickets first appears towards the age of puberty (' rachitis adolescentium '). ETIOLOGY.—The etiology of the disease is not clear, but from the point of prophylaxis and treatment two factors are all-important and these are widely accepted. The effect of bad hygienic surroundings. In support of this theory it is pointed out that patients with rickets are most numerous during the early summer, the disease having been set up as the result of confinement to the house during the winter, the effects of the confinement becoming manifest towards the end of the spring or the early part of the summer. Similarly the season of the year when rickets is least prevalent is towards the end of the year, the children having had plenty of fresh air and sun- shine during the summer. Rickets mainly occurs in the children of the poor, who are not only imperfectly fed, but are also closely confined to houses in which the hygienic conditions are defective. The effect of insufficient or improper diet, especially one deficient in fat. The observations made by Bland-Sutton on the rearing of lion cubs in the Zoological Gardens prove conclusively that imperfect diet can of itself produce rickets, and there can be little doubt that bad hj^gienic surroundings or congenital disease render the patient more susceptible to the effects of diet. PATHOLOGICAL CHANGES.—From the surgical point of view the main factor with wiiirh we have to deal in rickets is the osseous 4'^3

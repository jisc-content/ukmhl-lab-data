TREATMENT OF COMPLICATED FRACTURES X 2 In cases of transverse fracture, however, wires are not satisfactory, but they are of some value if better means are not at hand, because, although they do not fix the bones firmly together, they tend to prevent the sliding of the fragments upon one another, and so obviate lateral displacement. Usually it is sufficient to pass a couple of single wires through opposite sides of the bone, bringing the ends out through the medulla above and vice versa below (see Fig. 132), the ends being twisted, cut short, and hammered down as before. Ivory pegs are a good deal employed, but they possess the disadvantage that they tend to become loose and allow a certain amount of movement unless square pegs are used, which fit the drill hole tightly. These are more easily driven in than round ones, and get a firmer hold. The pegs are usually made 3 inches in length, but it is well to have them quite 6 inches long, as they are then driven in much more conveniently and with less danger of bruising the soft parts. When in position, tlie projecting end is cut oft flush with the surface of the bone by cutting phers. These pegs are now only used for securing fractures in tlie vicinity of joints where a plate apphed to the surface might interfere with movements, e.g. fractures of the neck of the femur. In the great majority of fractures, howe\er, particular!3^ those in which the displacement is lateral or over-riding, tlie best fixation can be obtained by applying a metal plate. For this purpose the steel plates devised by Mr. Arbuthnot Lane are now widelj' used. They consist of flat bars of steel of various shapes and sizes (see Fig. 133), provided with I'iG. 131.—Method of Wiring AN Oblique Fracture. Here a single wire is used.

The metatarsal bone may be removed along with its corresponding toe in a manner similar to that employed for the hand, by prolonging the handle of the racket-shaped incision upwards over the dorsal surface of the metatarsal to just beyond its base (see Fig. 243, B). In both the great and little toes it is important to remove as little as possible of the metatarsal bone, because both of them play an important part in support- FiG 243.â€”Amputations of the Toes. A. Amputations of the phalanges ; a is an amputation at the metatarso-phalangeal joint, b one through the first interphalangeal joint. B. Amputations of the toes along with the metatarsal bones ; a and c are amputations of the great and little toes with the heads of the metatarsals respectively. As little of the bone is removed as possible. The dotted line shows the direction in which the bone is divided, b shows the removal of a toe with its entire metatarsal bone. ing the weight of the body. It is also important to remember that no incisions should be carried into the sole of the foot, nor should they be placed either upon its inner or outer borders, as otherwise the resulting scar will be subject to pressure. For amputation of the hrst and hfth toes Farabeuf's method (see p. 512) gives excellent results. AMPUTATIONS OF THE FOOT. In actual practice it rarely that any set amputation of the foot can be performed with advantage to the patient. Just as in the hand, it is necessary to leave behind as much of the foot as possible, and therefore

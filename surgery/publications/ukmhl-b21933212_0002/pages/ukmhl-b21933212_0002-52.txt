20 AFFECTIONS OF SKIN AND SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUES After the wound has been stitched up, a pad of dressing is made to press the superficial and deeper parts together, and a mass of wool and a firm bandage are put on over them. These should be removed in Fig. 5.—Method of removing Sebaceous Cysts. This is the method most suited to the cases in whicli the cyst waU is thick and iirm, e.g. on the scalp. The cyst is first cut across by transfixion, and its contents squeezed out; then, as shown in B, the wall is laid hold of by catch-forceps and traction exerted. The wall pulls out and only a mere touch of the knife is required. about three days, the stitches taken out, and the surface of the wound and the hair around covered with fresh cyanide paste. The hair can now be combed over the wound, no other dressing being necessary. Of Cysts on the Face.—When the skin and the cyst wall are thin, it is better to dissect down upon the tumour from without inwards and en- close in the incision an oval piece of skin corresponding to the thinnest part. Unless this be done, too much skin will be left, and a portion may lose its vitality. Besides this, it is very diffi- cult to dissect the skin from the top of the sebaceous cyst, and the cyst wall will tear if an attempt be made to pull it out. After making this oval incision, it is generally easy to shell the tumour out of its bed by means of a blunt dissector. The skin should be brought together by fine horsehair, care being taken not to aUow the thin edges to become inverted. DERMOID CYSTS.—These are referred to in Vol. I. p. 265. They are frequently met with in the subcutaneous tissues about the angles of the orbits or in the neck, in connection with imper- fectly obliterated branchial clefts, most frequently, the second. The Fig. 6.—Removal of a Sebaceous Cyst ON the Face. The cyst is dissected down upon from outside, a portion of the thinned skin being included in the elliptical incision.

484 AMPUTATIONS each sweep is made, the cut muscle retracts, and the succeeding sweep is made close up against its retracted upper edge. The last sweep of the Fig. 215.â€”Circular Method of Amputation. In A the skin has been divided by a circular sweep of tlie knife, and is being retracted by an assistant prior to the circular division of tlie muscles which is seen accomplished in B, where the periosteum, after being divided circularly, is being stripped up by a rugine. C shows another but slower method, in which the cuff of skin is dissected up and turned back before the circular incision is carried through the muscles. knife is carried right down through the periosteum, which is thus divided circularly on the same level as the muscles. As the latter are retracted still further, the periosteum should be stripped up by a rugine (see Fig. 214) along with the muscular mass. The muscles should never be first

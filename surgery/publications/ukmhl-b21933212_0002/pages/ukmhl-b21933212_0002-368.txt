AFFECTIONS OF THE BONES 326 the muscle fibres. No drainage tube need be used. A shoulder-cap is applied outside the dressing, and the arm is bound to the side for the first fortnight. After that, the treatment is similar to that of a simple fracture. Fio. 150.—Repair of a Comminuted Fracture or the Upper End of the Humerus BY MEANS OF A SILVER WiRE AND A PlATE. FRACTURE OF THE ANATOMICAL NECK. This is an injury of some rarity ; it is more frequently met with in old people and corresponds in them to fracture of the neck of the femur. The Hne of fracture follows more or less completely that of the anatomical neck of the humerus and is, therefore, wholly or mainly within the capsule. The injury usually results from severe direct violence, such as falls or blows upon the point of the shoulder, and the resulting deformity is comparatively slight. The head of the bone may remain connected with the tuberosity by bands of untorn periosteum, but it may be com- pletely separated and even rotated so that its cartilaginous surface is in contact with the fractured end of the lower fragment; in these cases, of course, there is no prospect of union. The shoulder is slightly flattened. The lower fragment is drawn somewhat upwards under the acromion, and the head of the bone mav be driven into the tuberosity. TREATMENT.—The chances of bony union are not good enough to encourage the surgeon to run the risk of getting a stiff joint. Therefore, the chief attention should be given to massage from the first and passive movements after the first fortnight. An axillary pad is unneces- sary unless there be much tendency to displacement inwards. The elbow should not be supported, only a narrow wrist-sling being employed. The shoulder-cap need not be used, and the arm should not be fastened to the side. When the head of the bone is loose in the glenoid cavity—a

THE TREATMENT OF SIMPLE FRACTURES 269 The rough edges of the sphnt sliould be trimmed off before the plaster has set. If there be no signs of undue pressure upon the Umb, such as great pain, lividity, or anaesthesia of the toes, the sphnt should be left untouched for twenty-four hours ; at the end of this time the interval between the two lateral halves of the splint along the middle line of the front of the leg and the dorsum of the foot, which is merely covered by a few layers of muslin bandage, should be cut down with scissors, and the casing thus converted into two lateral splints hinged together behind by the muslin bandage. The fracture may thus be inspected easily, the limb being held in position in one half of the splint, while the other is turned back Fig. 117.â€”MtTiioD of Examining a Limb in a Croft's Splint. The limb is held steady in one half of the splint while the other is opened out. (see Fig. 117). The edges of the splint are then trimmed, and it is re-applied by means of an ordinary bandage. In this condition it may be left until all danger of complications has passed, and then, if desired, it may be converted into an immovable casing by applying a plaster of Paris bandage outside it. There are several precautions necessary in order to put on this splint successfully. The plaster should be of good quality, known as ' artist's plaster,' and must be free from lumps. It must be kept dry, as moisture combines with the plaster and cannot be driven off by merely drying. In cutting out the splint, allowance should be made for the slight shrinking that occurs when the flannel is impregnated with the plaster. The best plan is to make the lateral pieces large enough to meet in the middle line front and, back so that, when impregnated with the plaster of Paris,

ANEURYSMS OF THE UPPER EXTREMITY two muscles sej)arated and the supinator longus pulled firmly outwards by a retractor, when the artery will be exposed (see Fig. 88). The radial nerve lies nearly half an inch to the outer side of the vessel and does not come into view. Ligature in the Middle Third of the Forearm.—The incision should be made along the line of the artery over the interval between the supinator longus and the flexor carpi radialis. The muscles are separated, the former being pulled outwards and the latter inwards, when the vessel will he seen lying upon the radial origin of the flexor longus poUicis and flexor sul^ilimis digitomm. Tlie radial nerve is close to the outer side of the vessel (see Fig. 89). Ligature in the Lower Third of the Forearm.—An incision is made along the outer border of the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis, and this will expose the vessel which lies upon the pronator quadratus with a vein on each side of it (see Fig. 90). The radial ner\'e has left the artery and is on the back of the forearm. Ligature on the Back of the Wrist.—At the lower border of the pronator quadratus the artery dijis down deeply to the back of the hand, and passes beneath the extensor tendons of the thumli. It then turns forward to pass through the first interosseous space mto the palm of the hand

320 CHAPTER XVI. FRACTURES OF THE HUMERUS. Fractures of the humerus are usually divided into those affecting the upper end, the shaft, and the lower extremity. FRACTURES OF THE UPPER END OF THE HUMERUS. These comprise fracture of the surgical neck, fracture of the anatomical neck, separation of the upper epiphysis, and separation of the great tuberosity. Fractures of the upper end of the humerus may result from direct or indirect violence ; the fractures of the surgical neck are generally produced by indirect violence, such as falls upon the hand or elbow, while the other fractures usually result from direct violence. FRACTURE OF THE SURGICAL NECK OF THE HUMERUS. This is the most important and most frequent of the fractures of the humerus. It may result from either direct or indirect violence, in the former case from a fall upon the shoulder, in the latter from a fall upon the outstretched hand or elbow. The line of fracture is usually transverse, and the fractured ends are not always separated from one another ; in some cases impaction of the lower fragment into the upper takes place. The displacement that occurs depends largely upon whether or not tne fragments are entirely disentangled. When separation of the fragments is complete, the following are the chief displacements. Opinions differ considerably as to the displacement of the upper fragment, some holding that it is but slightly altered in position, whilst others assert that it is abducted and rotated outwards by the muscles inserted into the great tuberosity. The tendency to rotation outwards is, however, counterbalanced to a considerable extent by the pull of the subscapularis, and the probability is that, unless the bone be displaced by the violence producing the fracture, it remains much in its normal position. The lower fragment is drawn upwards either in front of or behind the upper

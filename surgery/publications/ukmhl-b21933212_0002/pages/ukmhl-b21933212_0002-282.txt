242 SURGICAL TREATMENT OF SPECIAL ANEURYSMS On the inner side are the semi-membranosus, the internal condyle of the femur, and the inner head of the gastrocnemius. The internal popliteal nerve and the popliteal vein are on the inner side of the artery below. The artery throughout is surrounded by fat, and has several lymphatic glands along it. The guide to its upper part is the outer border of the semi-membranosus, and it bifurcates on a level with the lower part of the tubercle of the tibia. Fig. 104.—Ligature of the First Part of the Left Popliteal Artery, (a) Sartorius; (6) long saphenous vein; {c) long saphenous nerve ; (d) popliteal artery ; ie) adductor magnus tendon. Operation.—^The best way to reach the upper part of the popliteal is to cut down upon it from the inner side of the thigh. The limb is placed in the same position as for ligature of the femoral, and the surgeon feels for the adductor tubercle and the tendon of the adductor magnus which is attached to it. He then makes an incision about four inches in length from the adductor tubercle upwards, parallel with the tendon of the adductor magnus, and slightly behind it. After the fascia has been divided, the sartorius wiU be found running downwards on the inner side of the thigh and overlapping the tendon of the adductor. When this

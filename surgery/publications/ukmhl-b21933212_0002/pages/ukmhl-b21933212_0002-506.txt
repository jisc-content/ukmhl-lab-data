CHAPTER XXV. 460 SYPHILITIC AND RHEUMATIC AFFECTIONS OF BONE. SYPHILIS. Syphilitic affections of bone may occur in the secondary and tertiary periods of acquired syphilis, and also in the inherited form. The treat- ment is essentially that of syphilis itself. SECONDARY SYPHILITIC LESIONS. Accompanying the congestive conditions of the skin in the early secondary stage of syphilis there may be bone pains which are probably due to congestion and do not leave behind any permanent lesion. But from the sixth month onwards, a definite syphilitic periostitis may occur and may lead to the formation of bony nodes. The bones most affected in this way are the skull (especially the frontal bone), the ribs, the sternum, the tibia, and the clavicle. The patient has nocturnal pains in the part, especially when warm in bed ; there is tenderness and a swelling, which may be considerable, though limited to one part of the bone. In the early stages, the periosteum is thickened, and beneath its deeper layer there is an effusion of gelatinous material, in which ossification may take place if no treatment be adopted, and which is termed a syphilitic node. If, however, treatment for secondary syphilitis be employed at once, the thickening may disappear entirely. TRB ATMBISTT.â€”The patient should be put on anti-syphilitic treat- ment (see Vol. I. p. 212), and it is well to keep the part at rest and strapped with mercurial ointment. If there be much pain, hot fomentations or lead lotion may be used ; beyond this no local treatment is necessary. TERTIARY SYPHILITIC LESIONS. In the tertiary stage, gummata of bone and syphilitic osteitis with, great thickening are met with. The gummata may occur sub-periosteaUy or in the medulla, and there may be either a circumscribed gummatous

TRANSVERSE FRACTURE OF THE PATELLA catch forceps (see Fig. 197). The drill is then removed, and the lower end of the wire is pushed through the aperture in the fractured surface of the lower fragment and made to emerge between the forceps. In order to facilitate the passage of the wire, the knee should be flexed to increase the gap between the fragments and a good long loop of the wire pulled out between them (see Fig. 198). This method of drUling the lower frag- ment from the fractured surface downwards and forwards to the anterior surface is much preferable to that often adopted of drilling upwards and Fig. icjS.—Wiring the Patella. Passing Ihe wire. The Unce is well bent and a long loop of the wire is pulled out and the lower end passed through the lower fragment from the fractured surface. backwards from the anterior surface and making the point of the drill emerge on the fractured surface, as is done in drilling the upper fragment. The method we describe renders it much easier to ensure the corre- spondence of the two drill holes on the fractured surfaces—a point of \'ital importance in securing accurate apposition and a good functional result. Fastening the Wire.—The wire is seized with strong forceps and pulled through and straightened by pulling firmly upon its two ends. It is held quite taut, and the fragments are pushed together over it by an assistant, wliile the limb is fully extended, great care being taken to see 11. DO

240 SURGICAL TREATMENT OF SPECIAL ANEURYSMS Matas's operation, which was first designed for the treatment of these aneurysms. This operation is described on p. 182. Ligature of the Superficial Femoral Artery.—In the ordinary cases of pophteal aneurysm proximal ligature is perhaps the safest plan, as it does not involve any risk of injury to the nerves or the vein. At the Apex of Scarpa's Triangle.—When proximal ligature is deter- mined upon, the point at which the artery is tied will depend to some extent upon the situation of the aneurysm. It is generally done at the Fig. 103.—Ligature of the Right Superficial Femoral in Hunter's Canal. (a) Long saphenous vein ; (6> fascia covering Hunter's canal; (c) femoral artery ; (d) long saphenous nerve ; (e) sartorius. apex of Scarpa's triangle (see p. 235). John Hunter, in introducing his operation, tied the artery in what is known as Hunter's canal; while some surgeons, with whom we are inclined to agree, tie the vessel, when- ever it is possible, at the upper part of the popliteal space. In Hunter's Canal.—Ligature of the artery in Hunter's canal is per- formed as follows : The knee is somewhat flexed, the thigh rotated out- wards, and the surgeon standing on the inner side of the limb makes an incision from three to four inches long in the line of the artery over the middle third of the thigh. After the skin and fascia have been divided, the

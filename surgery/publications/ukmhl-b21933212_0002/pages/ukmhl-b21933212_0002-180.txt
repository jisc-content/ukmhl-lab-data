AFFECTIONS OF NERVES 142 the ham. After the skin and fascia have been divided, the finger is passed in amongst the fat between the two heads of the gastrocnemius muscle, and will feel the internal popliteal nerve, which hes to the outer side of the popliteal vein. It is a stout round cord that is easily recognisable. Fig. 52.—Exposure of the Great Sciatic Fig. 53.—Stretching the Great Sciatic Nerve. Nerve. The hamstrings are being pulled in- wards with a retractor in order to expose the nerve. EXPOSURE OF THE EXTERNAL POPLITEAL NERVE. This nerve may be exposed by a similar incision to the last, but it is more readily dealt with where it passes round the head of the fibula to reach the front of the leg. In order to expose it here, an incision is made along the posterior edge of the tendon of the biceps; the nerve will be exposed as it lies immediately below the fascia, along the outer edge of the gastrocnemius muscle. Below the head of the fibula the nerve pierces the peroneus longus and divides into its terminal branches.

5i6 AMPUTATIONS scar lies to the outer side, and is therefore more out of the way of pressure than if the incision were made in a position similar to that for amputating the fingers. In this amputation the tendons should be sutured to the end of the stump (see p. 510). Farabeuf's method (see p. 512) also gives a good result. When the first metacarpal hone is to he removed, it is important to preserve the short muscles of the thenar eminence intact, as they form a fleshy pad which will be of value in aiding the grasp of the hand after removal of the bone. The best incision for this purpose is racket-shaped, and commences just above the articulation of the metacarpal with the trapezium. It should be carried down on the dorsal surface to a point short of the head of the metacarpal, and then made to diverge laterally to the web, and encircle the thumb just above the level of the first knuckle- joint 1 (see Fig. 234, C). The soft parts are dissected off the metacarpal bone, and the large thenar pad of muscles is left uninjured. The joint between the metacarpal bone and the trapezium is best opened from behind, the thumb being bent downwards into the palm, and the capsule thus rendered tense divided with the point of the knife. The internal lateral band may next be divided, great care being taken to keep the knife close to the bone. After that the external lateral band can be cut through, and then, by twisting the bone round, the anterior portion can be got at, and divided without any trouble ; the bleeding is com- paratively slight. The radial artery should not be seen ; only some of its digital branches near the end of the flap require ligature. ' A good guide to the line that the encircling part of the racket should follow is what Farabeuf calls ' the opposition crease.' It is the definite crease that is always present when the thumb is slightly flexed and opposed to the index finger.

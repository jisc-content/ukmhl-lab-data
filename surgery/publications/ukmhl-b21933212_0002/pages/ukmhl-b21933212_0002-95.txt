CHAPTER VII. AFFECTIONS OF THE MUSCLES. ATROPHY. Atrophy of muscles arises from many causes, and is usually due to defective innervation, such as occurs after division of a motor nerve, central paralysis or peripheral neuritis. Atrophy is also a common sequel to disuse of muscles, and it may result from direct injuries, such as blows, when it is due to haemorrhage into the substance of the muscle or to damage to the nerve supplying it. Atrophy also occurs in the muscles in the neighbourhood of joints which are the seat of tuberculous or rheumatic disease, and in these it proceeds more rapidly and extensively than can be accounted for by mere disuse of the articulation. Osteo- arthritis and traumatic arthritis are also accompanied by wasting of the muscles, and, in a lesser degree, atrophy is present in cases of congenital deformities of joints. After atrophy has gone on for some time, the muscles tend to shrink, and thus the tendons become tight, and may require division before proper restoration of the movements of the joint can be obtained. TREATMENT.â€”This depends upon the cause of the atrophy. When it is some central nervous derangement little can be done beyond promoting the nutrition of the muscles ; when the atrophy results from division of the motor nerve, nerve suture must be practised. Atrophy in connection with joint disease will persist until the condition of the joint so far improves that movements can be carried out freely, and even then some atrophy may remain permanently. Should atrophy supervene after an injury causing haemorrhage into the muscles, the sooner the effused blood is got rid of, the sooner will the functions of the muscle be restored. Although the first point in the treatment is to find out, and, if possible, remedy the cause of the atrophy, much m.a.y often be done to prevent it, or at anj' rate check its spread and hinder 6i

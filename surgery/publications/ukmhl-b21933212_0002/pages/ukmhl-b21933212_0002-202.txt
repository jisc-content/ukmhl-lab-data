AFFECTIONS OF ARTERIES 164 But, if thrombosis does occur, the process is more gradual than the sudden occlusion of the vessel by means of a ligature, which is the only alternative, and hence time may be gained for the collateral circulation to become sufficiently established to prevent the parts supplied by the artery from being completely deprived of blood. Fig. 60.—Arteriorrhaphy for complete Division of an Artery. The first suture only is represented. It shows how the edges are quilted up by it. The needle is represented as making the binding suture by being carried back behind its last point of exit instead of in front of it as in the previous two. As far as present experience goes it would appear that arteriorrhaphy should be attempted in preference to ligature in cases of wounds affecting the common carotid, the ihacs, the axillary, or any larger artery. Injuries of arteries, either in the form of contusion of the coats or subcutaneous rupture, unaccompanied by a wound in the skin, will be referred to in connection with aneurysm, as will also punctured wounds of the skin involving an artery. INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS. Like other structures, arteries may be the seat of either acute or chronic inflammation. ACUTE ARTERITIS. Acute arteritis involves all the coats of the artery, and usually results either from the presence of a septic thrombus in the interior or from extension of inflammation from the surrounding tissues to the coats of the artery ; in the latter instance a peri-arteritis occurs first. Treatment.—The ordinary sequela of acute arteritis is the occur-

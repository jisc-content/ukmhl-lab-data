Method of passing the wires. The elbow is fully flexed to increase the space between the fragments. After the wire has been passed througli the hole in the detached process, a long loop is pulled out, and the end of the loop is puslied through the hole in the base of the olecranon from the fractured surface. The catch-forceps are in position, as in the preceding figure ; those on the detached process have been taken off after the passage of the wire. The hand is put in in dotted outline in order to render the detail more clear. bone here, and made to appear on the fractured surface exactly opposite the hole previously made through the base of the process.

(Quain's Anatomy.] septic infection, as this would aggravate the neuritis already present. The usual effect of the operation is to produce a temporary para- lysis of the parts supplied by the nerve, which is generally partial, but which may be com- plete. This is often accompanied by perversion of sensation, which gradually passes off as the function of the nerve becomes restored. After the wound has healed, friction, massage, and counter-irritation should be employed. Nerve stretching without exposure of the nerve.—In the case of sciatic, this may be done by flexing the thigh to a right angle, whilst the knee is kept fully extended (see Fig. 43). A general anaesthetic should be administered. Neurotomy. — When nerve-stretching has been employed in vain for neuritis of a sensory nerve from which the patient is suffering great agony, some further operative interference be- comes necessary ; this generally takes the form of neurotomy or neurectomy. It is essential for the success of either of these operations that the portion of nerve divided or excised should be weU above the seat of the inflam- mation, as otherwise the affection spreads upwards in spite of it. The nerve should be exposed as near its central origin as possible before it is divided. Neurectomy is much more likely to be efficient than neurotomy ; when the latter is employed, the transmission of impulses is often restored rapidly, and the relief given by the operation is only temporary. Neureetomy.—We are therefore forced to the conclusion that the best practice is to per- form neurectomy when it is possible, and to excise a large portion of the nerve—two inches or more—so as to prevent the transmission of impulses along it. The operation should be confined to purely sensory nerves, except in cases of inoperable mahgnant tumours, where loss of motion is of no consequence. Excision of the Posterior Nerve Roots, —When a sensory nerve cannot be exposed above the inflammatory area, the question of the removal of the posterior nerve roots of the

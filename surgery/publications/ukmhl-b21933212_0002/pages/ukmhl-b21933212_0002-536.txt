488 AMPUTATIONS other flap, on account of the greater contractiUty of the muscles on the posterior aspect of the hmb. When the flaps have been retracted, the bone is divided at a shghtly liigher level than the base of the flaps. Here again, as in the circular method, a collar of periosteum may be raised in a similar manner and with a similar object. No retractors are required to keep the muscles out of the way of the saw in this form of amputation. The flaps are folded back and the soft parts are then well out of the way of harm. The advantage of making the lower end of the flaps consist of skin Fig. 2i8.—Amputation of the Thigh by means of Mixed Flaps. The long anterior and short posterior flaps consist of skin and muscle, and are both fashioned from with- out inwards. and subcutaneous tissue only is that they can be brought together more easily and with less tension than flaps cut by transfixion, or contain- ing much muscle, in both of which it is difficult to tuck in the protruding muscular mass when the wound is being stitched up ; owing to its elasticity the skin retracts considerably, leaving the muscles protruding beyond it. After transfixion operations it is not infrequently necessary to cut away a quantity of muscle before the flaps can be sewn up without tension. The Length of the Flaps.—It is important to remember that the skin is a very elastic stracture and retracts considerably after it has been divided ; the skin flap therefore undergoes considerable shortening after it has been raised. Moreover, the muscles retract and not only become shorter themselves, but pull the skin up along with them. Although the

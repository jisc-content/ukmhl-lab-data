ANEURYSM OF THE EXTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY 225 really preferable when the ligature is to be applied to the extreme lower end of the vessel. In aneurysm of the external iliac artery there is con- siderable risk of rupturing the sac when the peritoneum is stripped up from the iliac fossa in the extra-peritoneal operation, and in order to avoid this risk it is necessary to make an extensive incision through the abdominal wall, which may lead to weakness subsequently. I'iG. 94.—Suture of an Abdominal Wound in Layers. First layer. The peritoneum and the posterior layer of tlie sheath of the rectus are united by a continuous ' glover's ' suture of catgut; at the lower part of the incision the omentum is shown drawn down over the abdominal viscera. The Trans-peritoneal Operation.—To reach the vessel by the trans- peritoneal method an incision should be made either in the middle line or through the linea semilunaris on the affected side. Unless the patient be very fat it is always better to make the incision in the middle line, as it is easy to pull the margins of the incision to one side, so as to bring it over the brim of the pelvis. The patient is put in the Trendelen- burg position, and a vertical incision four to five inches long is carried n. Q

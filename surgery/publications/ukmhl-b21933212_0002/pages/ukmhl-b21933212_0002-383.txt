FRACTURES OF THE OLECRANON about a twentieth of an inch in diameter (No. 20 Birmingham wire gauge) is then puslied through the liole on the posterior surface of the fractured process, and a good length of it is pulled out between the fractured surfaces; this is bent into a loop so as to allow the end to be pushed through the corresponding hole on the opposite fractured surface, and thence out of the aperture at the base of the process (see Fig. 160). The passage of the wire can be facUitated by filing the end to a blunt conical point before sterilising; when a wire has been cut across with scissors, sharp edges are left which may catch in the fascia and impede its passage. During the passage of the wire the edges of the slits in the periosteum Fig. 161.â€”Operation for Wiring the Olecranon. Tjvisling Ihe wire. The figure shows the elbow-joint extended fully and the fractured process pushed down in place by an assistant as the wire is twisted ; a shows the correct method of twisting the wire. and fascia made before introducing the bradawl are held aside by the catch- forceps, otherwise, on attempting to introduce the wire through th.e first hole, it may be cUfficult to find the aperture in the bone, and when the end emerges from the second hole it may become entangled in the fascia and may be pushed down the arm for some distance. During the passage of the wire the elbow is fully flexed, so as to increase the gap between the fragments and give more room for the manipulations when the wire has been introduced. When the wire has been passed, the elbow is extended, and the wire pulled straight by grasping the ends in forceps and exerting traction ; an assistant pushes the fractured surfaces together and the wire is then bent round and twisted several times (see Fig. 161). No attempt should be made to force the fragments together bv traction on the wire ; tliis

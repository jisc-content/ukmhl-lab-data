TRAUMATIC AFFECTIONS HERNIA OF MUSCLES, In this rare accident tlie fascia snrronnding the muscle is torn, and the belly of the muscle protrudes through the opening, and becomes adherent to its edges. The affection is recognised by the presence of a soft lump in the course of the muscle, which moves when the muscle contracts ; the hole in the fascia can also be felt. The condi- tion sometimes gives rise to pain and muscular disability ; in some cases the disability is so great that the patient is compelled to seek surgical advice. A Fig. 20.—Hernia of Muscle. A shows the flap turntd up, exposing the hole in the deep fascia and the protruding iibres. B shows the incision drawn together at its edges, the central part being closed by catgut sutures, introduced so as to form a grille. THEATMENT. — This will only be called for when there is pain or disability, and then the clear indication is to cut down upon and reduce the hernia of the muscle after separating the adhesions between it and the hole in the fascia, and to attempt to bring the torn margins of the fascia together. If the slit be vertical, the result is satisfactor}/; when it is transverse, how- ever, union is not so easily effected. A curved incision should be made over the herniated portion and a flap turned aside. The muscular fibres are defined, separated from the fascia and pushed back. If the fascia be sufficiently loose, an attempt should be made to close the opening in it. In any case it should be closed as far as possible with a continuous catgut suture, the strands of which crossing the space will probably be sufficient

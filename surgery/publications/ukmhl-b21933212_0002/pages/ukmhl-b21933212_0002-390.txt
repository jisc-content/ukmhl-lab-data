AFFECTIONS OF THE BONES 348 movement should be employed (see p. 280) and the sphnt may be given up entirely in four weeks. When there is also Dislocation of the Head of the Radius.—/n recent cases reduction of the disloca- tion is readily effected under an anjesthetic. The head of the radius can be pulled into place by simple extension, and at the sam.e time the fractured ends of the ulna are manipu- lated into position. The fore- arm should be put up in a moulded splint in the supinated position with the elbow at a right angle, and a pad is placed in front of the head of the radius to pre- vent recurrence of the disloca- tion. Passive movement, especially rotation, should be begun within the first fortnight. In lons^-sianding cases of dis- location of the radius, it is usu- ally necessary not only to cut down and divide the fracture of rhe ulna, but to remove the head of tf e radius. It is some- times possible to get the head of the radius into position after dividing the fractured ulna, but, if not, the loss of the head of the radius does not materi- ally affect the movement of the elbow-joint. For the method of exposing the head of the radius, see p. 346. Access to the frac- ture of the ulna wiU be got by cutting down directly on it posteriorly. FRACTURE OF THE RADIUS ALONE. Fig. 165.—Fracture of the Ulna with Disloca- tion OF THE Head of the Radius. This fracture is generally due to indirect violence, such as a fall upon the hand, and is much commoner than fracture of the ulna alone. The displacement varies according as the fracture is above or below

159 VARICOSE VEINS adherent portion of the vein, the blades are opened, and the adhesions are stretched or broken down, so that the dissector can be pushed along still further. A twisting movement will also faciUtate removal of the portion it is desired to remove after it has been divided below. This operation should be always performed from the ]:)roximal to the distal part of the limb, so as to avoid the risk of de- taching thrombi into the blood-stream. Palliative Treat- ment.—Any cause, which })redisposes to the varix, should be removed if pos- sible in the first place. Garters should be inter- dicted, the stockings being upheld by suspenders. Con- stipation should be remedied by appropriate means, and when the trouble is due to pregnancy, the recumbent position should be assumed as much as possible. In fact, anything that is found to be causing pressure on the veins should be relieved or removed. In the second place steps must be taken to relieve ihe congestion of the extremity, and facilitate the venous return. While the patient is at rest, the limb should be elevated so as to aid the return of blood, and di- minish any cedema present. Except in \^ery severe cases, it is unnecessary to confine the patient to bed or even to the couch, but the limb should be placed on a suitable rest at a higher level than the pelvis, \\henever there is an opportunity of sitting down. If this can be done frequently during the day, it will do a good deal to prevent increase of the affection. The return of the blood may be facilitated still further by gentle massage of the hmb from the foot to the groin. The rubbing should be applied very gently, otherwise it is apt to cause injury to the delicate walls of the veins, and may lead to phlebitis and thrombosis. All that is I'lC'. 57.—Mavu's bn;.. ijianeous Enucleation of Varices. The sketch shows diagprammatically how the dissector is pushed down along the vein after it lias been divided above.

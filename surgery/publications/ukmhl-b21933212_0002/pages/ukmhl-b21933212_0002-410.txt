CHAPTER XIX 368 FRACTURES OF THE FEMUR. Fractures of this bone may be divided into those affecting the upper end, the lower end, and the shaft. FRACTURES OF THE UPPER END OF THE FEMUR. These fractures are divided into those of the neck and those of the great trochanter. Fractures of the neck of the femur are again usually subdivided into the intra-capsular and the extra-capsular forms. In the intra-capsular fractures the line of fracture is assumed to lie within the capsule of the joint, whilst in the extra-capsular forms it lies outside it. As a rule, however, the distinction between the two forms is not perfectly accurate, because the line of fracture is generally partly intra- and partly extra-capsular in its course; the fracture is really called intra- or extra-capsular according as the greater part of the line of fracture is within or without the capsule. INTRA-CAPSULAR FRACTURE. True intra-capsular fracture is comparatively rare, and is most frequent in old people in whom senile bone changes are marked. In old subjects a process occurs, termed osteoporosis, in which the bone becomes unduly porous and brittle, and the direction of the neck of the bone also becomes more horizontal; the line of fracture is usually close to the head of the bone. The fracture is generally caused by a comparatively slight injury, such as a fail upon the knee or the trochanter. When it results from indirect violence, such as a fall upon the knee, there is no impaction, but when it follows blows upon the trochanter, some impaction is not un- common, the neck of the bone being driven into the head. The impaction, however, is not usually permanent and is not firm enough to insure bony union.

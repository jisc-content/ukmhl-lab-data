312 CHAPTER XV. FRACTURES OF THE CLAVICLE AND SCAPULA. FRACTURES OF THE CLAVICLE. The clavicle is more often fractured than any other bone. This is due to the fact that the whole weight of the body is transmitted to it in faUs upon the hand or elbow; it would probably be much more fre- quently fractured than it is but for its peculiar shape and its compara- tively free mobility. Fracture is most common in infancy and childliood and in the male sex, but it is frequent at any age, and in both sexes. The fracture may occur at almost any point in the bone, but its usual situation is at the junction of the two curves near the centre of the bone, and, far less frequently, at the acromial or the sternal extremity. All these fractures may be due either to direct or indirect violence ; they may be simple, compound, greenstick, or comminuted. DISPLAOBMBNT.—In the Ordinary Form.—In the common fracture at the junction of the two curves—which is generally due to indirect violence—there is a characteristic displacement of the fragments. The shoulder, and with it the outer fragment, is depressed, rotated forwards and drawn inwards towards the middle line. The inner fragment retains its normal position, as it is held in place by the unbroken rhomboid ligament. In some cases it is said to be drawn upwards by the sterno- mastoid ; this, however, is doubtful. In Fracture of the Acromial End.—In fractures between the conoid and trapezoid ligaments, the displacement downwards and inwards charac- teristic of the ordinary fracture is absent; the only one that occurs is rota- tion forwards of the shoulder, which may be some days before it becomes marked. This point is important to remember, because the accident may at first be overlooked, owing to the absence of displacement, and the diagnosis may not be made until deformity becomes evident. In Fracture of the Sternal End.—When the fracture is internal to the rhomboid ligament there is only slight projection forward of the inner

AFFECTIONS OF TENDON SHEATHS 90 remain and afterwards increase in size. In all these cases it is best to dissect out the sac. A curved incision is made over the swelling, a flap turned aside, the ganglion exposed, and its wall isolated with a dissector and cut away. In doing this, the sheath of the tendon is naturally opened, and, should the ganglion communicate with a joint, the articular cavity is also exposed ; but if the operation be done antiseptically no trouble results. The wound is sutured without a drainage tube, and, as a rule, it is not necessary to put on a splint. Active and passive motion are begun after a few days, but there is little tendency for the tendon to adhere to its sheath.

40 AFFECTIONS OF THE LYMPHATIC VESSELS at birth; more often it manifests itself at puberty. It has been known to follow an injury. The swelling differs from hemi-hypertrophy in that the bones are not enlarged, and, in marked con- tradistinction to filarial elephan- tiasis, has no tendency to affect the genitalia. The skin is subject to ulceration as in other types of lymphatic obstruction (see Fig. II, B). Treatment.—This is as un- satisfactory as that of other types of lymphatic obstruction, and only palliative means can be A employed. It should follow the lines laid down for the treatment of simple lymphatic obstruc- tion (see p. 33); ulcers must be treated on the general lines laid down in Vol. I. LYMPHANGIECTASIS. This is a varicose condition of the 13/mphatic vessels. It may follow upon inflammations which obliterate or strangulate the main vessel, or upon pressure from bandages, cicatrices, etc., but in these cases the vessels seldom attain any great size, and do not become markedly varicose. The most common cause of the typical varix of the lymphatic vessels is the presence of the Filaria san- FiG.

IS USUally met With lU the SCrotum, where it is known as lymph scro- tum, and in the groin, where it is termed lymphadenocele. In Ijauphangiectasis there are distended tortuous tubes which may be both felt and seen, and the affected area becomes swollen and somewhat oedematous. When the lymphatics of the skin are attacked, vesicles may appear over the course of the vessels, and these often burst and lead to an exudation of lymph, sometimes in large quantity. Lymphadenocele is generally bilateral, and is characterised by the presence of a soft fluctuating swelling in the groin.

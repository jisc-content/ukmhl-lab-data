CHAPTER XXVIII. 478 TUMOURS OF BONE. Tumours in bones occur as primary growths, as secondary deposits in connection with tumours in distant parts, or as extensions of tumours commencing in the soft parts in the neighbourhood. The primary tumours of bone are chiefly exostoses, chondromata and sarcomata. Secondary tumours are sarcomata or carcinomata, arising either by metastasis or by extension from neighbouring parts. Hydatid cysts also occur. EXOSTOSES. Exostoses occur in two forms, the ivory sessile variety found chiefly on the skull, and the spongy pedunculated form which occurs in the neigh- bourhood of the epiphyseal lines. The spongy exostoses may be multiple, and may interfere with the movements of the joints or muscles in their neighbourhood. The ivorj; exostoses usually occur on the bones of the skuU, and seldom attain any great size. As a rule they do not cause any trouble beyond possibly a little deformity. They are sessile and very dense. TREATMENT.â€”When a patient has an exostosis which causes him inconvenience, there should be no hesitation in removing it, unless it be in some inaccessible region. The removal of a spongy exostosis is comparatively easy because ossification generally commences very early at the point of junction of the exostosis with the bone, and growth only proceeds in connection with the layer of cartilage which covers its surface ; hence an exostosis of large size may have a narrow neck. An incision is made down to the tumour, the neck is cleared and chiselled off or clipped through with bone forceps, after which the growth is shelled out of its capsule. The operation must be performed strictly aseptically. Before the antiseptic period, even this slight damage to the bone was often followed by severe sepsis, and many patients died of pyaemia. At the present time, however, these operations are perfectly simple and safe.

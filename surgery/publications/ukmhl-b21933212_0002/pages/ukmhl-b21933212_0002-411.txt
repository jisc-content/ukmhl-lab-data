FRACTURES OF THE UPPER END OF THE FEMUR 369 The shaft and the outer part of the neck are generally drawn upwards, partly as a result of the force and partly by muscular contraction, and consequently there is always shortening of the limb. In true intra- capsular fracture this shortening is slight, rarely exceeding three-quarters A B Fig. 177.â€”FrAciURiis of the Neck of the Femur. To show the position of the limb aud tlie shortening.

Later on, unless means be taken to prevent it, the shortening may become more pronounced owing to the contraction of the muscles and the gradual stretching of the capsule ; the latter is the principal agent in preventing the bone from being drawTi upwards to any great extent immediately after the injury. The limb is rotated outwards, so that the foot is everted and lies \\ith its outer border II. BB

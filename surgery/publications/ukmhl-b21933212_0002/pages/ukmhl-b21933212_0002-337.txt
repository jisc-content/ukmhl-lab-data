TREATMENT OF COMPLICATED FRACTURES also follows prolonged suppuration in or around muscles, and is also said to occur as a sequel to prolonged exposure to cold. Symptoms.—In the early stages there is swelling and lividity of the extremity often, but not invariably, accompanied by pain. The extremity is cold and oedematous, particularly when allowed to hang down. Later on, pressure sores or a number of large bullae often develop under the splint, but not invariably so. The t^'pical lesions are paralysis of the Fig. 128.—Volkmann's Contracture. The upper figure shows the wrist extended ; the fingers are then automatically flexed. In the lower figure the wrist is flexed ; the finger can then be extended. flexor muscles followed by contracture, which sets in early and progresses rapidly. The electrical reaction of the muscles affected is unaltered in recent uncomplicated cases. If there be any reaction of degenera- tion present there is some nerve lesion coexisting, probably due to direct pressure by the splint on one of the nerve trunks. In uncompHcated cases also there is no anaesthesia, and no trophic skin lesions; the whole extremity may be oedematous and livid, but there are no cutaneous eruptions or ulcerations. When the forearm is affected, the hand begins to

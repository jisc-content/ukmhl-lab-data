410 CHAPTER XXI. FRACTURES OF THE LEG AND FOOT. In the great majority of cases both the tibia and the fibula are broken ; either bone, however, may be broken separately. FRACTURES OF THE TIBIA ALONE. The fractures may be grouped into those of the upper end, the shaft, and the lower end. FRACTURES OF THE UPPER END OF THE TIBIA. These injuries are rare. The fracture sometimes involves the articular end of the bone, as in falls from a height on to the feet, when the tibia is driven forcibly up against the condyles of the femur and the tuberosities of the tibia are split. This is sometimes spoken of as a ' compression fracture.' In some cases the spine of the tibia is detached, and in children a separation of the epiphysis is occasionally met with. Fracture may also occur just below the tubercle and is generally due to severe direct injury, such as the passage of a cart over the limb. The fracture may be trans- verse or oblique ; when it is transverse there is usually slight displace- ment owing to the breadth of the fractured surfaces. When it is oblique, the obliquity is generally from above downwards and forwards, and the upper fragment projects somewhat anteriorly. TREIATMEINT.â€”In a case of compression fracture, an anjesthetic should be administered, firm extension exerted, and the fragments mani- pulated into position. Extension will be required to prevent the tibia from being pressed up against the femur. Ordinary weight extension (see p. 275) with four to six pounds will generally suffice. Any tendency to outward rotation of the leg is best counteracted by applying a back splint as high as the knee and making extension from the splint. Evaporating lotions (see Vol. I. p. 9) will be required for the first ten days to subdue the effusion in and around the joint.

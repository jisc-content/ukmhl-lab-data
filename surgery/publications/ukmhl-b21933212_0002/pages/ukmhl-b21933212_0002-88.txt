54 AFFECTIONS OF FASCIA DESMOIDS. The term desmoid is applied to a fibrous tumour originating in the muscles or muscular fasciae of the abdominal wall. Nearly all the recorded cases have been in married women who have had children, and indeed the tumour may be first noticed during pregnancy or soon after labour. Occasionally they have been found in men. They are situated in the abdominal wall and may involve a large portion of the muscular bundles or the sheath of the rectus. They grow slowly and form firm painless masses, more or less oval in shape or flat like a plaque. Some degree of mobility across, but not in the direction of, the muscle fibres may be obtained, and when the muscle is made tense the tumour becomes fixed. Unless care be taken to remember the existence of these tumours, they are very likely to be diagnosed as intra-abdominal. To the naked eye on section, the tumour has a white appearance and the fibrous tissue is plainly visible. There is no capsule, and at the edge the growth can be seen extending into the muscle fibres. Microscopically they consist of spindle cells and fibrous tissue, the former being abundant at the growing edge, and the latter in the older parts of the mass. They resemble closely a spindle-celled fibro-sarcoma. Cystic and myxomatous degenera- tion may occur. TREATMENT.â€”The tumour and the portion of muscle or fascia to which it is attached must be removed. When the tumour is adherent to the rib, the affected portion of the bone must be excised. Unless a wide removal of the structures involved be carried out, recurrence will take place. When a large portion of the abdominal wall is affected, removal may be impossible. No other treatment than by operation is likely to be beneficial.

AFFECTIONS OF THE BONES 286 sufficient to trust to an assistant to steady tlie limb. When two lateral splints are used, it may be possible to keep the parts steady by removing one sphnt, while the assistant holds the limb firmly against the other ; the dressing is applied to the side thus exposed and the splint is re-applied ; then the opposite splint is removed, the limb is firmly held in contact with the one first removed, and the change of dressing is completed (see Fig. 117). This plan is difficult when the wound is extensive, and under these circumstances the following arrangement will be found more satis- factory. Two or three rods of malleable iron are taken and are bent outwards into a semicircle over the region of the wound as shown in Fig. 127.â€”Interrupted Plaster of Paris splint. Showing how the iron bars incorporated with the plaster bandage are bent to allow free access to the wound. The limb is slung from a cradle ; as a rule the plaster bandage would be carried above the knee. Fig. 127. The extremities of these bars are then incorporated in a plaster of Paris bandage. A bandage of boric lint is first applied to the limb above and below the wound; over this a few turns of plaster of Paris bandage are put on, and then the metal bars are adjusted, and their ends are covered in by fresh turns of the plaster bandage. An interruption is thus formed of sufficient size to allow of free access to the wound. In this way a firm spUnt, taking its purchase from the limb above and below the wound, is formed, the whole area is accessible, and dressings can be renewed as frequently as may be necessary without disturbing the fracture. The edges of the plaster must not come too near the wound, otherwise they will be soiled by the discharges. Necrosis of the fractured ends often occurs in septic cases, and after a

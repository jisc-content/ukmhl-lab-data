394 AFFECTIONS OF THE BONES SEPARATION OF THE LOWER EPIPHYSIS. This is a comparatively rare occurrence ; the injury always necessarily involves the knee-joint and is often associated with defective develop- ment of the bone afterwards. It generally occurs from forcible over- extension of the knee and, consequently, the epiphysis is carried forward in front of the lower end of the diaphysis, which is pressed backward, and may exert dangerous pressure upon the popliteal artery. The injury is often compound. TREATMENT.—Recent researches, particularly those of Hutchin- son and Barnard,1 seem to show that this particular injury is best treated by full flexion of the knee without the use of any splint. Their description of the method is as follows: ' Under complete anaesthesia an assistant makes steady but strong traction upon the tibia in the line of the limb. This overcomes the upward pull of the quadriceps extensor and brings the epiphysis down to the hue of separation. The operator then clasps his hands beneath the lower part of the thigh, and draws it steadily upwards, gradu- ally flexing completely the knee and hip-joint, whilst the assistant still keeps up the traction on the leg. It will be seen that this manoeuvre causes the epiphysis to move back upon the fractured surface of the diaphysis until it has reached its normal position, and further movement is pre- vented by the periosteum coming into tight contact with the anterior surface of the femur. ' A bandage is then applied around the thigh and ankle, fixing the knee at about an angle of 60°. Complete flexion—i.e. heel on but- tock—we have found to be unnecessary, and the wider angle is more comfortable. The limb is laid upon its outer side on a pillow, and an ice-bag can conveniently rest uopn the front of the knee to Umit the effusion.' > Lancet, May 13th, 1899.

TREATMENT OF COMPLICATED FRACTURES anaesthetic. It may be necessary to immobilise the hmb for more than three months, and if imion is delayed massage and Bier's bandage may be of value. Inclusion of Nerves in tlie Callns.—The large nerves winch run in grooves along or in close proximity to the bone may be sur- rounded by callus which exerts pressure upon them as ossification goes on, and gives rise to pain and loss of function. The ireatment has already been referred to (see p. 112). Adhesion of Muscles and Tendons to the Fractiu-ecl Ends.—There may be extensive adhesions of the muscles to the bones, and it is important to remedy the resulting disability of the limb when this has occurred. The ii'eatment has been dealt with fully in connection with the question of massage in fractures (see p. 280). Swelling of the Limb on using it.-—This is a fairly frequent, though transitory, complication of fractures in the lower extremity. Unless some of the principal veins are blocked, it disappears spontaneously in a short time. The complication can be reduced to a minimum and its disappearance greatly hastened by the early use of massage (see p. 280).

302 AFFECTIONS OF THE BONES difficulty in keeping the bone ends in proper apposition, mechanical means of fixation (see p. 305) must be resorted to. The wound should be sutured without a drainage tube if possible, but when there has been severe laceration of the tissues and the oozing is persistent, a tube should be used. When the deep fascia is thick and well defined, as, for example, in the thigh, this should be sutured separately so as to pre- vent adhesion of the muscles to the skin, and to check haemor- rhage from the muscle; it obviates the risk of a collection of blood, which would call for the use of a drainage tube (see Fig. 129). The limb should be left undisturbed for ten days unless a drainage tube has been used, when it must be dressed at the end of twenty- four to forty - eight hours and the tube removed. The stitches are removed at the end of ten days, and the splints re-applied. The wound should be sufficiently firmly healed for massage to be started at the end of the third week. The splints may be removed temporarily for the massage without any risk, if this be done carefuUy. Ossification in the union may be delayed after these operations, and the splints, therefore, should not be finally abandoned until the surgeon is sure that bony union has taken place. After union is complete, massage should be persevered with, in order to increase the nutrition of the muscles and to loosen adhesions between them and the bone. Non-union.—Proper consoHdation between the broken ends of the Fig. 129.'—Suture of the Deep Fascia after Operations for UNITING THE Femur. The deep fascia is united by a continuous ' blanket suture' and thus bulging of the large thigh muscles is prevented.

TRAUMATIC AFFECTIONS lOI of the curve being opposite the point at which it is hoped to unite the tendon, and the ends being well beyond the inner border of the tendon. A flap of skin, with the superficial and deep fascia, is turned inwards, and then the divided ends of the tendon are sought for, the fibrous tissue removed, and the ends united. Rupture of the Ligamentum Patellae.—In the ligamentum patellae, on the other hand, the employment of position alone seldom yields a satisfactory result, and it is therefore well, whenever possible, to perform immediate suture of the tendon. As a rule the tendon is torn off at or Fig. 33.—Rupture of the Licam entum Patella treated by Position. For flie sake of clearness the bandages fastening the limb to the splint have been omitted. close to the patella, and the operation may involve opening the knee joint. The curved incision should have its convexity upwards, and its lower limit should be below the tuberosity of the tibia. The flap is turned down, the torn ligament exposed, any loose tags of tendon arc chpped away, and the latter is united in the manner already described (see p. 93). In a broad tendon like the hgamentum patehee, it is advisable not merely to have a fixation suture at each side, but also one or two in the central part ; a continuous catgut suture should be inserted in the intervals between these. After the wound has been closed, the leg is placed on a back sphnt, which is raised on a pillow or rest, in order to relax the quadriceps extensor fully. The splint is gradually lowered, until, at the end of the first fortnight, it lies flat on the bed. The splint may be left off in three weeks

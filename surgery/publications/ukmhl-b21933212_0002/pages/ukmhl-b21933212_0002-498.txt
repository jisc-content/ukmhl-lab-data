AFFECTIONS OF THE BONES 452 to form. At the same time that the tuberculous deposit is making its way to the surface, the periosteum in the vicinity is becoming thickened and new bone is being deposited, so that the bone usually becomes con- siderably enlarged. Tuberculous sequestra are usually somewhat wedge-shaped, with their bases either beneath the articular cartilage or on the free surface Fig. 212.—Tuberculous Dactylitis. Diagrammatic vertical sections to show the two types of the disease. In the right-hand figure the proximal phalanx of the index finger is seen rarefied and expanded ; in the left-hand one the shaft of the prox- imal phalanx of the thumb has necrosed and is surrounded by a sheath of new bone. of the bone. Their further progress is similar to that of the caseating deposit just described. An abscess may then form outside and burst. When the abscess is opened or bursts spontaneously, a probe passes down into contact with a dense tuberculous sequestrum. The characters of a tuberculous sequestrum will be found on p. 454. Tuberculous Osteo-myelitis.—Here the medullary tissue is infiltrated with tuberculous material. This condition specially affects the shorter of the long bones such as the phalanges and metacarpal bones ; it may end in the formation either of a soft caseating mass, or of sequestra as

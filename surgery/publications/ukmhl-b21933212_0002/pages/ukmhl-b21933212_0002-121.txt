The non-operative methods of treatment, which may have to be em- ployed in some cases, are very unsatisfactory. Fixation of the part on a suitable splint for a prolonged period is essential. Simultaneously, firm pressure should be applied by means of a mass of cotton wool wrapped around the limb with a bandage stiffened with gum or starch outside it. In the case of the hand, for example, the hmb is fixed on a splint with the lingers in a semi-flexed position, the metacarpus extended, and the thumb hanging down over the side of the splint, and not appUed closely to the forefinger; this position is adopted because, should stiffness occur, the power of opposition of the thumb to the I'lO. 24.â€”Method ok Applying a Splint to the Hand and Forearm in Tei-jo-synovitis.

When a case of this kind is complicated wdth joint or bone disease, the chances of eradicating the mischief, by either expectant or operative treatment are comparatively small.

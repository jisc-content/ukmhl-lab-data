91 CHAPTER IX. AFFECTIONS OF TENDONS. TRAUMATIC AFFECTIONS. The injuries of tendons which require consideration are division through an open wound, subcutaneous rupture, and dislocation. The treatment varies according as the injury is recent or old. DIVISION OF TENDONS. Injuries accompanied by division of tendons usually occur about the hand or the forearm; the tendon may be divided transversel}^ or obliquely. RECENT INJURIES.â€”The immediate result of the division of a tendon is loss of movement in the part to which the tendon is attached, and separation of the divided ends. This separation is entirely due to the retraction of the upper end caused by the contraction of the muscle from which the tendon takes its origin. The degree of separation depends partly on the anatomical arrangement of the tendon and partly on the length of the muscle ; the longer the muscle, the greater will be the retraction. As regards the first point, some tendons have accessory con- nections with bones, or junctions with other tendons, and cannot there- fore be drawn up, even when they are completely divided. For instance, there are fibrous bands passing between the three inner tendons of the extensor communis digitorum which prevent any marked degree of retraction of the divided ends. There are also bands running from the tendo Achillis to the bone above its main point of insertion, and these serve to keep the tendon more or less in position, if the wound be close to its insertion ; on the other hand, if the division occur more than an inch above that point, there are no restraining bands of this kind, and there may be very marked separation, a gap of as much as an inch and a half being sometimes left between the divided ends. When a tendon has been divided, and the ends remain in fairly close

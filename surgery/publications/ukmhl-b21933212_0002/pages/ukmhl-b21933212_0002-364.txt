AFFECTIONS OF THE BONES 322 In this form of fracture there is no need for any special extension apparatus. It is, however, often the practice to put on a shoulder- cap for greater safety. In order to fashion a shoulder-cap, a sheet of brown paper is applied to the sound shoulder, and from it is cut a pattern for the shoulder-cap (see Fig. 146, A), which should extend from the root of the neck above nearly down to the elbow-joint below, and well over the Fig. 145.â€”Bandages applied in Transverse Fracture oe the Upper End of THE Humerus. The left-hand figure shows how the triangular bandage is applied hori- zontally around the thorax after the fracture has been reduced and a pad placed in the axilla. The other figure shows the apparatus completed. The point of the triangular bandage is turned up around the forearm, between it and the chest, and turned over and pinned, as shown above. A narrow wrist-sling is then put on, with a shoulder-cap over all. pectoral and scapular regions. Lower down it should encircle two- thirds of the circumference of the arm (see Fig. 146, B). The pattern, when cut, is laid upon a sheet of gutta-percha, poroplastic, or leather, which is then cut to this shape; poroplastic is, perhaps, the inost manageable and comfortable material. The splint is then softened. If it be of gutta- percha, it is immersed in hot water; if of poroplastic, it is warmed before a hot fire or steamed in a steriliser; if of leather, it is immersed in vinegar. The splint is applied to the injured side and rapidly fitted, moulded and bandaged in position, while it is still soft. If gutta-percha or poroplastic

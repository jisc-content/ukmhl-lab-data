CHAPTER VI. 55 AFFECTIONS OF BURS/E. WOUNDS. The bursal cavities are in close relation with the lymphatic vessels, and therefore any septic infection of them is particularly dangerous, and may lead to violent inflammation. For example, when the bursa over the olecranon has been punctured, enormous swelling of the arm with redness and cedema not uncommonly results. So great is the swelling in proportion to the damage done to the bursa, that, when the puncture is not obvious, it is difficult to arrive at a just estimate of the condition unless this fact be rememberecf. TREATMENT. â€”When a bursa is wounded, care must be taken to disinfect the wound ; the entire bursal cavity should be swabbed out with undiluted carbolic acid, the opening being enlarged, if necessary, whilst the skin around is disinfected in the ordinary manner. A drainage tube is then inserted into the cavity and antiseptic dressings are applied. The after-treatment must be conducted on the lines already laid down for the treatment of accidental wounds (see Vol. L Chap. VII.). If inflammation has already set in, the cavity must be laid freely open, sponged with undiluted carbolic acid, and packed with gauze ; if the inflammation be very severe, warm boric fomentations (see Vol. I. p. 35) maj' be applied outside. INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS. An inflammation of a bursa may be acute or chronic. ACUTE BURSITIS. .\cute bursitis occiu"s either as a serous or a purulent inflammation. It may follow contusions, especially if there has already been some chronic inflammation, or it may be secondary to some inflammation in its vicinity,

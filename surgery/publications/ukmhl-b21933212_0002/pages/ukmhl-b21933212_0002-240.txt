200 SURGICAL TREATMENT OF SPECIAL ANEURYSMS in some cases, but is difficult to perform effectually; it causes great pain to the patient, and can only be continued for half an hour to an hour at each sitting. The pressure must necessarily be also exerted upon the vagus and is apt to give rise to serious cardiac symptoms. We do not, therefore, recommend its use. The pressure is made directly backwards by the fingers against the transverse processes of the fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae at the level of the cricoid cartilage (see Fig. 76). Fig. 76.—Method of applying Digital Compression to the Common Carotid. Proximal Ligature.—This is the best method to employ in all cases in which the aneurysm is near the bifurcation. When, however, it is near the origin of the vessel, the distal operation must be performed, because the proximity of the aneurysmal sac and the disturbance to the soft parts caused by the aneurysm render Ugature of the innominate artery impossible. When the aneurysm involves the bifurcation of the carotid, or is quite close to it, it is generally advisable to ligature the internal and the common carotid simultaneously, because the free anastomosis of the branches of the external carotid would otherwise tend to defeat the operation. Ligature of the Common Carotid Artery below the Omo-hyoid.— The operation for hgature of the common carotid above the omo-hyoid muscle has already been described (see p. 193), but when the aneurysm

230 SURGICAL TREATMENT OF SPECIAL ANEURYSMS external wound. This exposes the sub-peritoneal fat and fascia which lies immediately outside the peritoneum. Care must be taken to identify these structures, as it is common to mistake the transversalis fascia for the peritoneum in ligaturing these vessels, and to strip it up from the iliac fossa, carrying with it the vessels, so that they are in front of the finger ; the surgeon then cannot find the vessels. After the transversalis fascia has been divided, the patient is rolled over towards the sound side, and the peritoneum is gently separated from the posas and iliacus muscles until the vessels are exposed (see Fig. 98). The wound is then retracted with broad copper spatulae, the sheath of the artery opened in front by a small incision, and the aneurysm needle gradually insinuated around it from within outwards. Fig. 99.—Suture of Muscles bV the Mattress Stitch.—^This suture is used when the muscular fibres have been divided transversely. In Astley Cooper's operation the cord and the vas are displaced upwards and inwards along with the transversahs fascia, and the only structure requiring special attention is the genito-crural nerve, which lies on the sheath of the artery and must not be included in the hgature. After the vessel has been Ugatured, the peritoneum is replaced, the muscles are united in layers by silk (see Fig. 99), and the skin is brought together by a continuous suture. No drainage tube is required. After-treatment.—After the operation the whole lower extremity should be carefully disinfected (see Vol. I. p. 100), wrapped in a large mass of salicylic wool and somewhat elevated upon a pillow; sandbags are appHed along the side of the trunk to keep the patient still, while great care is taken to see that there is no constriction anywhere in the limb and no undue pressure, especially about the heel. The object is to

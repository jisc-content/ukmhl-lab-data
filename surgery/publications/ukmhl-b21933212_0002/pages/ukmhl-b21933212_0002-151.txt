117 TRAUMATIC AFFECTIONS Hence, when a surgeon has to deal with a wound in the neighbourliood of important nerve trunks he should always see whether the functions of those nerves are impaired, for if nerve suture be required it should be done simultaneously with the treatment of the original wound, as the operation is then easier and more likely to be successful than if it be delayed until the wound has healed. ABC Fig. 38.—End-to-end Suture of a Nerve. The three stages of the procedure are shown in ^, B, and C respectively. Primary Nerve-suture.—The divided ends of the nerve are exposed in the wound and examined ; if the cut surfaces be cleanly cut they may be sutured without any preliminary preparation, but if they be ragged it will be necessary to shave off a small portion on either side with a very sharp knife, so as to have the opposed surfaces quite smooth and sharply cut. The best material for approximation is the finest chromic catgut, on an ordinary round sewing needle ; 1 the sharp edges of the triangular surgical needle are apt to divide the nerve fibrils. ^ Only the finest size procurable must be used. If this be not at hand, the finest silk may be used. For the small nerves a very useful sewing material may be made by untwisting the three strands of which fine suture silk is made up and using one of them.

3ea. I. ^95 Of Hernia, In diforders’of this kind, from cooling ap- plications, than from thofe of an oppofite nature. In different inflances I have ven- tured on the application of ice and fnow, fometimes with evident advantage, and I never faw them do harm'^. But in gene- ral, the remedies I depend moft on here, are, cold faturnine folutions, and cloths kept conftantly moift with a mixture of cold water and vinegar. By a proper application of one or other of the remedies now mentioned, or by a due combination of all of them, many cafes of hernia are relieved without any farther affiftance: But it frequently happens, not- withftanding every endeavour, that the protruded parts cannot be returned j the fymptoms, inftead of abating, become more violent; and the event of the difeafe is of courfe rendered more doubtful. In this fltuation, when no probability remains of fuccefs from the employment T4 of * By fome writers, this pra£lice has been confidered ^s hazardous; but I find it recommended by others to whom much credit is due, particularly by the late Dr Monro.

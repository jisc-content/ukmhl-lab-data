512 Of the Sarcocele, Chap. iXt and not the quantity of water which fur- rounds it. ColIe(5lions of water are no doubt often met with, even in the real farcocele; but this ought to be confidered only as a diffe- rent ftage of the fame difeafe: For altho* the true fcirrhous teflicle is never at firft attended with any collecftion of this na- ture, it is natural to fuppofe, that a hard difeafed ftate of that vifcus, muft have fome influence in producing an alteration in the quantity of fluid with which the tunica vaginalis is always provided in a found'healthy ftate. If it either produces an augmented fecretion, or a diminifhed abforption of that fluid, a dropfical fwell- ing muft be the certain confequence ; ^nd every fuch colledlion, combined with a fcirrhous tefticle, has been very properly termed a hydro-farcoccle. That the teftis, by remaining long im- merfed in the water even of a true hydro- cele, does frequently become fomewhat altered in its texture, there is no reafon to 3 doubt.

Sea. IV. Of Hernia. 361 in receiving the direaions nfually given on this fubjea. On reading the remarks of the late Mr Sharpe upon this point*, to fecure the epigaflric artery by means of a ligature, one would expea to be the eafieft of all operations; but the difficulty which in re- ality attends it, is fuch as mull convince every one who has tried it, that Mr Sharp himfelf had never put it in praaice. But even although this accident of wounding the epigaftic artery could be guarded againft in the moft eafy and effec- tual manner, yet I will venture to fay, when a femoral hernia is of any conlider- able llze, the diflenfion of the ligament thereby produced muft bring the fpermatic veffels fo nearly on a line with the under border of the ligament, as to render it al- together impoffible to divide the one with- out the other; and whoever will examine thefe parts in the ftate we have now de- fcribed, will fee that this cannot be avoided, whether the incifion be carried direcidly upwards, I f Critical Inquiry into the prefent ftate of Surgery.

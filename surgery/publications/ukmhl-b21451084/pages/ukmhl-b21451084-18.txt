4 and useful knowledge of which can be acquired only in the Dis- secting room and in the Laboratory. A knowledge of these sciences will, in some measure, prepare the mind of the Student for entering with advantage on the study of the functions of the human body in the state of health,—of the derangements to which these functions are liable in diseases,—and of the ge- neral means to be employed in preventing, alleviating, and cu- ring these derangements,—branches of medical knowledge which form the Institutions or Theory of Medicine. With the study of the Theory of Medicine that of Natural History and of Botany is very closely allied, and would, in my opinion, be very advantageously associated. Without this previous course of professional instruction, a Student can be but very imperfectly prepared for entering upon the study of particular diseases, and of the various remedies to be employed in their treatment. In order to derive advantage from attendance upon courses of lectures on the Practice of Physic and Surgery, and on Materia Medica, the student would require either to enjoy, or to have previously enjoyed, opportunities of observing diseases in pri- vate practice,—in Dispensaries for the sick,—or in Public Hos- pitals,—for, without the actual observation of diseases, it ap- pears to me to be absolutely impossible for him to form any ac- curate notions of the morbid phenomena which he hears describ- ed, or of the uses and effects of remedies. Of the general means hitherto employed to communicate useful information to those engaged in the study of the medi- cal profession, I know of none which, in point of importance, can be at all compared to Clinical Courses of Lectures on Physic and Surgery, where Students are directed in their ob- servation of diseases, and of the effects of remedies, by able and skilful practitioners. To those who are to be engaged in the general practice of Medicine, no branch of knowledge is more necessary, and re- quires to be more assiduously cultivated, than that which re- lates to the proper management of women in the states of preg- nancy and parturition, and to the diseases to which they and children are liable. The variety of occasions on which medical men are called to give evidence in Courts of Justice, renders a certain degree of knowledge of those matters which are likely to become subjects of judicial investigation, necessary to every medical practitioner, since ignorance of, and errors in, these matters, may injure the cause of humanity, or frustrate the ends of justice, and must tend

I regard Clinical Lectures, therefore, not only " to be a useful mode of " conveying practical instruction in Surgery;" but I consider such Lectures as you have for many years past delivered in this great Medical School, to be of infinite importance even to the Medical Student, and calculated to convey to him many illus- trations and much practical knowledge of the pathology of in- ternal diseases, which he will in vain look for elsewhere. From my heart, I wish you every success in your present laudable en- terprise; as I can conceive few greater improvements in the mere medical education of our future graduates than the intro- duction of the Clinical Lectures on Surgery into the Curriculum of the University. I am, My DEAR Sir, Your's most truly, GEORGE KELLIE.

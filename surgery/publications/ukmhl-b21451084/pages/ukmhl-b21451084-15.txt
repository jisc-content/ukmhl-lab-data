APPENDIX. Although I do not entertain any doubt concerning the soundness of the argument relative to the arrangements for the class of Clinical Surgery, I did not choose to trust sole- ly to my own judgment in a matter of so great import- ance. I therefore requested some of the most eminent Physicians of Edinburgh and Leith to favour me with their opinion on the subject. They readily complied with the request; and I now flatter myself, that whoever reads their letters to me with attention, will be satisfied that I am completely borne out in every thing that I have ad- vanced in the Argument. LETTERâ€”Dr. James Hamilton, Senior, to Professor Russell. My Dear Sir, In reply to your*s of this morning, I have no hesitation in say- ing, that I consider a competent knowledge of Anatomy, and of the general principles of Surgery, to be an indispensible acquire- ment of the Medical Practitioner. Permit me to add, that from my connexion with you in the Royal Infirmary of this place, I had an opportunity of witness- ing your early essays as a Lecturer, and iiave since observed the assiduity and attention with which, to the advantage of your hearers, and to the improvement of your profession, you have conducted many successive courses of Clinical Surgery. This testimony on ray part is due to your various merits; to have withheld it would have been unjust. I am. My DEAR Sir, Your's very sincerely. J. HAMILTON. Edinburgh, 22, St. Andrew's Square, 5th November, 1824. To Professor Russell

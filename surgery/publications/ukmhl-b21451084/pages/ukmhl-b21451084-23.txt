which form the confines of Medicine and Surgery—^however con- clusive such arguments may be. T shall consider your questions as bearing solely'on him who is to be educated exclusively to Me- dicine, without the prospect of ever interfering with the practice of Surgery, though in this country such a case be a rare one. Even in this extreme case, however, I regard " a competent " knowledge of Surgery to be not only a requisite qualification to *' form an accomplished practical Physician,"—but, next to Ana- tomy, I have long been led, from much observation and reflec- tion, to consider a clinical or practical knowledge of the prin- ciples of Surgery as one of the most important elements of a regular medical education, and, indeed, as the very ground-work of pathological science. I could say much on this most important subject, but to you a very few hints will suffice to enable you to comprehend my meaning. It is in the observation and study of those external diseases which belong to the province of Sur- gery, that the various morbid and curative processes, on which are founded the sciences of pathology and therapeutics, can best be explained and demonstrated to the young Physician. The Student, for example, who has opportunities of becoming prac- tically acquainted with the phenomena and management of wounds—whose attention is directed to the slight inflammation, the adhesion, and speedy reunion in one case,—to the increased pain, throbbing, heat, redness, and tension, and to the conse- quent suppurations, abscesses, and sinuses in another,—-to the ul- cerations, gleetings, fungosities, and calosities in a third,—to the gangrenes and sloughings in a fourth,—and to the varieties of symptomatic fever in all, must acquire a knowledge of the doc- trines and pathology of inflammation, more precise and intimate than can be obtained from any other source with which I am acquainted. The surgical study of aneurism is in like manner necessary to the right apprehension of the diseases of the heart and vascular system within the three internal cavities of the body, and of many therefore of the most obscure and important diseases which fall to the care of the Physician; while the Clinical ob- servation of the structure, characters, and progress of external tumors is admirably calculated to illustrate the history of many analogous and more obscure diseases of internal organs. It were easy to multiply examples of this kind. The greater number of surgical diseases being obvious to the sight and other senses, the Clinical Teacher has in them the means of directing the Student's attention to the whole series and progression of those morbid actions and changes, which are

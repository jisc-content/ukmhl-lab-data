SERO-CYSTIC TUMORS, &C. 156 the constitution. Still, I am not prepared to say that it may not, under certain circumstances, and in peculiar constitutions, assume a malignant character ; this being no more than may happen to almost any morbid growth. I may refer you to what I have said on another occasion, in reference to the malignant degeneration of the common fatty or steatomatous tumors ; and also to my lectures on the diseases of the urinary organs, whose you will find an account of a case in which the indurated deposit connected with a fistula in perineo was affected with carcinoma; and the patient died in consequence. I have hitherto confined myself to the descrip- tion of the origin, progress, and treatment of this disease of the breast, without venturing to give it a name. It is, however, necessary that we should have the means of distinguishing it in conversation and in writing ; and I would suggest “ the sero-cystic tumor of the breast ” as being an appropriate appellation, preferable, at all events, to a mere arbitrary term; inasmuch as it expresses, with sufficient precision, the character which the tumor possesses in its origin.

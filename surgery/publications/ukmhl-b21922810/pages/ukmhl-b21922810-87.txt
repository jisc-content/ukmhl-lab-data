71 EFFECTS OF STRANGULATION. f 4 respiration, the animal may be said to die a second time. In others, although sensibility is restored, and with it the power of locomotion, it is only for a time; another attack of coma follows, and this is fatal. These statements are founded chiefly on experi- ments made on the lower animals, but there is no essential difference between the phenomena which occur in them and in the human subject. The case which I am about to mention justifies this observation. It was communicated to me by Mr.Rose, under whose care the patient was placed. A boy, of the name of William Claridge, seventeen years of age, attempted to hang himself in the evening of the 17th of July 1820. He was dis- covered after a short period of suspension (the exact length of the period being unknown), and immediately cut down. He was at this time com- pletely insensible; his face was livid, his lips were of a dark purple colour, the pupils of his eyes were dilated and motionless, his pulse not per- ceptible at the wrist.

The pulse was now perceptible, but often flagging, and the surface of the body was disposed to be cold. The countenance was still of a livid hue, but the breathing became more frequent and regular, and there was also an improvement in the pulse. At the end of another hour an attempt was made to

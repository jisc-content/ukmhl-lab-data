The ulti- mate result was, that the induration consequent on the inflammation disappeared, and that no signs of the disease remained. But such simple modes of treatment as are use- ful in the early stage of the disease are wholly inefficient after the growth of solid substance is begun. In this more advanced period of the disease, no good is to be expected, except from the removal of the entire breast; and such an operation may be had recourse to with every prospect of success. The disease seems to be entirely local. It belongs to the breast, and to nothing else. It does not contaminate either the skin or the lymphatic glands ; it is not complicated with any correspond- ing disease of the viscera; and all the experience which I have had justifies the conclusion, that if care be taken that no portion of the breast be allowed to remain, we need not be apprehensive of its recurrence.

It is, however, desirable, with a view to a more ready and accurate diagnosis, that we should con- sider what are the diseases with which it is most liable to be confounded. The principal of these are as follows :â€” First: A thin membranous cyst, containing a

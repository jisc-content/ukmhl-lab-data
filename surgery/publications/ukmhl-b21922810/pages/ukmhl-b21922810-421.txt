CHRONIC ABSCESS OF THE TIBIA. 405 very simple. You expose the surface of the bone, and make a circular opening with a trephine at that part where there seems to be some tenderness and some pain on pressure. One principal thing to be attended to is that you have a proper tre- phine. You do not want so large an one as for the cranium, and it must be somewhat differently constructed. Those which lie on the table are made for the purpose. One is of very small dia- meter, but, generally, it is quite sufficient. The common trephine is made with a projecting rim or shoulder, and if there be much enlargement of* the bone, it will not penetrate deep enough to reach the abscess. It is true that you may break away the bone afterwards, by means of a chisel, but the operation may be more easily performed with a trephine having no projection, which will at once penetrate to the abscess, however deep it may be, and render the chisel unnecessary. The after-treatment is as simple as possible. There may be some pain for a day or two, and especially, as in the case I last mentioned, if the patient be an hysterical female, there may be hysterical pain afterwards; but all that is required is to maintain the general health, and lay on some simple dres- sing. The bone soon granulates, the space is filled up by a sort of fibrous substance, and the wound cicatrises. But wThat would happen if you were not to perform the operation ? The patient may continue in torture for a great number of years, losing all the best part of his life ; or a worse event than that may take place. The preparation which I

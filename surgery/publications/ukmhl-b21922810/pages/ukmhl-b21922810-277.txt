TIC DOULOUREUX, OR FACIAL NEURALGIA. 261 s 3 wishes. He did it at last in order to satisfy the patient; but the division of the nerves, instead of giving relief, very much aggravated the evil. It is altogether an unscientific operation, from which we have no more right to expect benefit than we should have from the amputation of the testicle in a case of pain referred to that organ in conse- quence of a calculus being lodged in the ureter. In those cases in which the disease has an inter- mitting and periodical character, you can always relieve it, as you may all other cases of inter- mittent and periodical disease, by the exhibition of quinine, bark, and arsenic. But then, if you give quinine, it must be in rather large doses; sometimes in very large ones. I saw this very morning a gentleman who had formerly a nervous pain in the back, almost as bad as tic douloureux in the face. It was intermittent and periodical. I told him, when he consulted me about it, that most prohably the sulphate of quinine would cure him. He took ten grains daily without benefit ; he took twenty with little benefit; and was not cured till he took half a drachm daily. Whether he had been supplied with genuine unadulterated quinine I will not venture to say ; but at all events he must have taken the medicine in very large doses. The combination of bark and arsenic, also, is an excellent remedy in these cases of inter- mittent and periodical disease; but I generally prefer giving quinine first, it being a more innocent medicine, requiring no watching, and the use of it not being subject to the inconveniences which belong to that of arsenic.

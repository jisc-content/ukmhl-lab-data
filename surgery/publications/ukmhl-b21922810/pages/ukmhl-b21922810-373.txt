MORTIFICATION. 357 A A 3 artery in the middle of the thigh, even for some inches of its course. In other cases, one or more of the arteries of the leg are obliterated, while the femoral artery is still pervious. In one case, of which I have preserved notes, there was no ossification of the ar- teries anywhere, but the femoral artery was converted into a gristly cord, so as to be quite impervious from the origin of the profunda to the point at which it perforates the tendon of the great head of the triceps adductor muscle. In none of these cases, in which the arteries were contracted and impervious, were there any such appearances as would have indicated that the contraction had been the result of previous inflammation; and it appeared to me that the change which had taken place in their condition was best to be explained by supposing it to be the result of a contractile process, analogous to that which pro- duces a permanent stricture of the urethra or oesophagus. It has been said that mortification of the toes in old persons is often the result of disease in the heart itself. This does not, however, exactly correspond with the results of my own experience. It is true, that I have known persons who had disease in the heart to die of mortification of the toes; but then there was always enough in the condition of the arteries of the limb to account for the mortification, independently of the other disease. Thus, in one case in which there was mortification of the right foot, the muscular struc ture of the heart was soft, thin, flaccid, and easily torn, and one coronary artery was impervious ;

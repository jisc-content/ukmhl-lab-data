85 DEATH FROM DROWNING. g 3 The Benito seems to breathe in the air with not much less facility than in the water, and even to seek opportunities of exercising the former method of respiration; as if he were striving to pass the barrier which separates him from that higher, order of animals in which the more perfect oxygenation of the blood occasions the developement of a larger portion of nervous energy. But the converse of the proposition which I have just stated does not, as far as I know, hold good in any one instance. Animals which are constructed to breathe the air of the atmosphere by means of lungs, or of organs analogous to lungs, (those few reptiles only being excepted which are provided with gills also,) can breathe the air of the atmosphere only; and from man, the head of the creation, down to the snail or caterpillar, we find that they all die, when retained for a limited space of time beneath the surface of water. Although a diversity of opinions may have existed formerly as to the mode in which submersion in water produces death, there is no such diversity at the present time. Death from drowning is similar to death the consequence of strangulation ; and the want of the due oxygenation or decarboniza- tion of the blood is the sole cause of the animalâ€™s destruction. If a small animal be immersed in water in a transparent glass vessel, the phenomena of drown- ing are readily observable. There is first a deep expiration, by which bubbles of air are expelled from the lungs. There is then an effort to inspire; but the effort is ineffectual, there being no air

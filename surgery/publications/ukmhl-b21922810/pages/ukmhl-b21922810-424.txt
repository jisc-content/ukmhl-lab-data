CHRONIC ABSCESS OF THE TIBIA. 408 the patient occasionally ever since, and know that he has had no return of the complaint. But is it possible to doubt that, if the state of things I have described had gone on, the knee-joint must have been destroyed ? What would have happened if recourse had not been had to the operation ? A case occurred in this hospital, not exactly similar, but sufficiently so to enable me to answer this question. A man of the name of Hendrow was admitted, in February 1837, with the upper end of the tibia enlarged just below the knee-joint. There was an opening leading down to the centre of the bone, and a probe introduced into it came in contact with a piece of bone that appeared to be dead and loose. It was plain that a piece of bone in the centre of the tibia had exfoliated and formed an abscess, which had afterwards made its way externally. But that which renders the case interesting as connected with the present inquiry is this ; whenever the patient took exercise there was an accumulation of fluid in the knee- joint, just as in the last case. The swelling dis- appeared on the joint being kept quiet; and the motion of the joint was perfect, or nearly so.

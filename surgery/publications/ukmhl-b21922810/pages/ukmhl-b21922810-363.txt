In fact it is difficult to explain the local effects produced by this virulent poison from the anatomical structure of the parts, or on any known physiological principles. I am in possession of the notes of an experiment made by the late Mr. Ewbank (who died several years ago, having been for some time my colleague in this hospital,) with this same rattlesnake. A rabbit bitten in the shoulder became affected by the poison in a few minutes, and died at the end of three quarters of an hour. Even in this short space of time the cellular membrane, to a great extent, was in a state of slough, although the skin and the muscles were not affected. There are several other animal poisons that operate in the same manner. I have only one practical observation to make, in these cases, namely, that you may prevent the extension of the mischief produced by the animal poison, by the application of a ligature round the limb, above the bitten part. It seems to stop the influence of the poison upon the cellular mem- brane, and, at the same time, to prevent it from entering into the circulation, and affecting the general system ; and we must bear in mind, that, in these cases, besides its local operation, the poison has a powerful influence on the consti- tution. The constitutional symptoms, however, are not to our present purpose, and, therefore, I shall not describe them.

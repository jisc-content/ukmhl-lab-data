350 MORTIFICATION. Mortification from sudden Loss of Blood. As the circulation of the blood is necessary for the maintenance of life, so, whatever for a con- siderable time prevents a part of the body from being supplied with blood, will produce mortifica- tion. A very copious blood-letting, for instance, will, under certain circumstances, give rise to it. I will mention a remarkable example, which fell under my observation some years ago, in a case which I attended, with the late Dr. Babington. The patient, a medical officer, in the East India Company’s service, had gone out to dinner, and drunk an immense quantity of wine, so that he got exceedingly tipsy. This was in the city. He staggered up Holborn, as well as he could, and found his way into a chemist’s shop. Here he vras mad enough to ask the person who stood behind the counter to bleed him; and whether this person was tipsy or not also I do not know; but, however that might have been, he certainly did bleed him ; and not only that, but the two blockheads agreed that he could not be bled too freely; and the drunken man lost, I believe, not less than three pints of blood. He then became exceedingly ill; was carried home in a coach ; and the next day both his feet were mortified, from the extremities of the toes to the instep. We gave him wine, and nourishment, and he recovered ; the sloughs separating, the dead bones coming away, and the stumps of the feet healing.

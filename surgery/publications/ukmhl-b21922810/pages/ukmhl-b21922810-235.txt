Secondly, If any of the toes are displaced in any of the ways which I have before described, we must endeavour to restore them to their natural position. In young persons this may be generally accomplished. A contrivance made use of by the bandage-makers is very useful on these occasions. It consists of a thin plate of metal covered with thin leather, or a piece of strong leather, fitted to the lower surface of the foot,â€”not to the whole of the surface, but extending from the extremities of the toes nearly to the tarsus. Slits are formed in this plate of metal or leather, and tapes are passed through these slits, forming loops above, by means of which the toes are bound down and retained in their proper places. In many cases the same object may be attained by simpler means. A long stripe of linen, spread with adhesive plaster, about two thirds of an inch in breadth, may be passed over the toes which are too much elevated, and under the others, the extremities of the plaster being made to cross over the metatarsus. If this be neatly applied, it will keep the toes parallel to, and on the same level with, each other. Which- ever of these methods is adopted, it is necessary that it should be persevered in for a very consider- able time. In older persons, in whom the toes have been long displaced, they have sometimes become so adapted to their unnatural position, that it is almost needless to attempt to alter it. Under such circumstances we are sometimes, in hospital

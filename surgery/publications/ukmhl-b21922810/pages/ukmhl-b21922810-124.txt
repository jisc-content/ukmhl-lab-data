108 CYSTS CONTAINING WATERY FLUID appearance, and coagulating with heat, are met with in various parts of the body. Sometimes they form a part of morbid growths of a malignant nature ; at other times they are mere local diseases, having nothing malignant in their character. In some instances the cyst is a nest of hydatids, which escape, some of them entire, and others broken into fragments, when the cyst is opened. But these cases are all different from those which are now under our consideration ; in the latter, the fluid consisted of little else than pure water, and there were no debris of hydatids, as there would have been if this had been the nature of the disease. Besides, in a case of hydatids, according to my experience, the evacuation of its contents is always followed either by suppuration of the cyst, or by an immediate re-accumulation of the fluid. But cysts which contain an uncoagulable watery fluid are not uncommon in other organs, as well as in the liver. As I have told you on other occasions, you find them in the necks of infants, sometimes extending downwards, even within the parietes of the chest. The true encysted hydrocele is another example of the disease. The fluid is colourless and watery, containing scarcely any animal matter, and quite different from that of the hydrocele of the tunica vaginalis. If you dissect the encysted hydrocele, you find a very thin mem- branous bag, quite distinct from the tunicks of the testicle ; sometimes lying between the tunica vagi- nalis and the epididymus; at other times inter- posed between the tunica vaginalis and the tunica alluginea, but more frequently in the cellular mem-

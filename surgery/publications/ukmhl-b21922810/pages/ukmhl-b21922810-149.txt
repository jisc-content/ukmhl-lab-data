133 UNUNITED FRACTURES. k 3 bones in a state of the most complete repose, by means of a suitable application of splints and bandages; at the same time that the broken extre- mities are kept firmly and steadily pressed against each other. By this pressure, a fresh action is induced, and the bones are at last found to grow together. I do not know that this firm pressure produces the union of the bone by a process at all like that which takes place in the first instance after the occurrence of a fracture. It seems to be more probable that it causes the surfaces to grow together, without the provisional callus being formed on the outside. However that may be, I know that in several cases it has succeeded per- fectly. Such was the result in three cases which I attended with Mr. Amesbury. In one of these the fracture was in the arm; in another in the fore-arm; and in the third in the thigh. The last case is remarkable in some respects. The thigh bone had been obliquely fractured in the middle of the shaft. The patient was supposed to have recovered, if recovery it could be called, where the limb was full three inches shorter than the other. The union was so strong that the patient could throw the whole weight of his body on the injured limb, and in my presence hopped round the room upon it. On a careful examination, how- ever, there was found to be so much yielding motion between the upper and lower portions of the bone, that it was plain that the union could be merely ligamentous ; and the result proved this opinion to be correct, as, after Mr. Amesburyâ€™s treatment was concluded, the difference in the length of the two

404 CHRONIC ABSCESS OF THE TIBIA. And now the following important questions present themselves. What are the circumstances that would lead you to suspect the existence of abscess in the tibia ? And supposing it to be pro- bable that such an abscess exists, what are the exact steps of the operation to be performed for its relief? When the tibia is enlarged from a deposit of bone externallyâ€”when there is excessive pain, such as may be supposed to depend on extreme tension, the pain being aggravated at intervals, and these symptoms continue and become still further aggra- vated, not yielding to medicines, or other treat- ment that may be had recourse to, then you may reasonably suspect the existence of abscess in the centre of the bone. You are not to suppose that there is no abscess because the pain is not con- stant ; on the contrary, it very often comes on only at intervals, and in one of the cases which I have related there was, as I then mentioned, an actual intermission of seven or eight months. After the disease has existed a certain number of years, indeed, the pain never entirely subsides, but still it varies, and there are always periods of abatement and of exacerbation. The combination of circumstances which I have described will fully justify you in making an opening into the bone with a trephine. But how will it be if you are mistaken ? This will not often occur ; but if it should, the taking out a circle of bone can be of no consequence ; no injury follows the operation: it is unattended with danger. The operation itself is

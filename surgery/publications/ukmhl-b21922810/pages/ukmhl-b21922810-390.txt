In every instance the stump mortified, and the patient died. The chance of recovery from mortification of the toes is not very considerable ; that is to say, there is a great chance of the patient dying; but still, under proper treat- ment, there is also a fair chance of recovery, and you ought not to risk this chance by inflicting on the diseased limb so severe a local injury as belongs to amputation. I have told you that disease of the arteries lays the foundation of mortification, but the disease may exist many years without mortification super- vening, until some accidental circumstance brings on inflammation. I have known persons with dis- ease of the arteries, and several toes mortified in consequence of it, in whom the mortification has stopped, the sloughs have separated, the sores have healed, and who have lived for years after- wards.

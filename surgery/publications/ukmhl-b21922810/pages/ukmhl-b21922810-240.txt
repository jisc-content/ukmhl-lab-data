224 CORNS AND BUNIONS. spread with adhesive plaster, is to be applied on the inside of the little toe, so as to occupy the whole of the inner surface, from the apex to the second joint. The leather should be cut so as to be thin at its margin; and it should be sufficiently broad to admit of being doubled over a good part of the upper and under surface of the toe, as well as its extremity.. This contrivance will keep the little toe at some distance from the next toe, and prevent it /rom sliding again under it. If both of these expedients fail, the patient must be content to wear for a time the metallic or leathern plate, with loops of tape for inclosing the toes, which I have already described. The bunion, which is frequently formed on the inside of the ball (as it is called) of the great toe, differs in some respects from the disease of which I have hitherto spoken. The great toe ought to be in a line with the metatarsal bone, by which it is supported. But a shoe which is too narrow at its extremity causes it to incline towards the outside, displacing, in a greater or less degree, the toe next to it, as I have explained already. In some cases, the effect of pressure on the great toe is actually to alter the position of the joint between it and the metatarsal bone ; a portion of the articulating surface on the extremity of the latter being absorbed, and a new articulating surface being made to supply its place more externally than the old one. The existence of these changes I have ascertained by dissection.

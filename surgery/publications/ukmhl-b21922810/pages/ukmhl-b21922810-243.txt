CORNS AND BUNIONS. 227 Q 2 kind of caustic. The concentrated nitric acid answers the purpose well. The sharp end of a probe armed with lint may be dipped in the acid, and applied for a few seconds to the inner surface of the bursa. A thin slough will, of course, be formed; on the separation of which the bursa will probably granulate, contract, and heal; otherwise the application of the caustic must be repeated. After what I have said it is needless for me to offer any further observations as to the means which may be adopted with a view to prevent the bunion from being regenerated. A case came lately under my observation, in which what appeared like a bunion on the inside of the ball of the great toe contained an albuminous substance, of the consistence of the vitreous humour of the eye, similar to what is met with in the ganglions which we meet with in the neigh- bourhood of the wrist, and in some other situa- tions. Whether this was an ordinary bunion, in which the vessels of the bursa assumed the action of secreting this particular substance, or whether it was really a common ganglion, I was unable to determine. The treatment which I adopted was that of opening the cyst freely, and applying the concentrated nitric acid to the inner surface. It was necessary to proceed with great caution, lest I should injure the joint or bone beneath, and there- fore several very light applications were required. My object was to destroy the secreting surface, and obtain a granulating surface in its place ; and when I last saw the patient, previously to her returning into the country, I had reason to believe

VARICOSE VEINS AND 190 The operation, however, is proper where there is a varicose cluster much distended, and liable to burst and bleed. Here you may actually save the patientâ€™s life by having recourse to it; and you may do so without considering whether fresh clusters are or are not likely to form afterwards. Sometimes, when there is a varicose cluster above or below, on which a varicose ulcer depends, you cause the ulcer to heal, sooner than it otherwise would, by dividing the cluster. In such cases I observe that it generally heals sooner if you divide the cluster below, than if you divide the cluster above. Then there are some cases where a varicose cluster is productive of an unusual quantity of pain, apparently in consequence of there being a nervous filament lying over it which is kept on the stretch. And here you may relieve the patient from the pain of this particular varix by the division of it. But these occasions are of rare occurrence; and under other circumstances I repeat that it is not worth the while of any patient to submit to the operation. I ought not to take leave of the subject which is before us, without referring to a very ingenious method of obliterating varicose veins, which has been lately adopted by M. Velpeau, of Paris. He introduces a pin or needle through the skin, which is passed underneath the vein, and at right angles to it. A twisted suture is then applied round the two ends of the pin, so as to compress the vein sufficiently to produce its obliteration. I cannot, from my own experience of this practice, say any thing of its advantages or disadvantages; but

EFFECTS OF STRANGULATION. 60 afterwards, the forearm and hand were benumbed, and the muscles were paralytic, and several weeks elapsed before these symptoms were completely removed. 4. There can be no doubt that strangulation causes death by closing the trachea, and pre- venting respiration ; and that whatever other effects it produces are of secondary importance to this. Dr. Munro hanged a dog, having previously made an opening in the trachea below the part at which the ligature was applied ; the animal was kept in this state for an hour, and lived after- wards. If an animal be hanged, and, as soon as he becomes insensible, an opening be made in the trachea below the ligature, he begins to breathe, and his sensibility is restored. A ligature which includes the trachea, and nothing else, produces death exactly in the same manner as if the entire neck had been included in it. It is needless to adduce further evidence on the subject. The mode of death from strangulation or hanging is sufficiently obvious. 1. The treachea is obstructed, so that air cannot enter the lungs. 2. The blood passing through the lungs does not undergo that change which respiration produces, and which is necessary to life. 3. Dark-coloured blood, which has not been purified by exposure to air, is transmitted to the left side of the heart, and from thence to the brain and other organs. 4. The heart continues to act, circulating dark- coloured blood, but its actions gradually become

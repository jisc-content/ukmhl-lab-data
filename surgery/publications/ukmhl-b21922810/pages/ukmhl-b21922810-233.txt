217 CORNS AND BUNIONS. to give immediate relief. On the following day he was well. I wTas desired to see another patient, a young lady, under the same circumstances, except that the symptoms were more severe. The inflammation involved nearly the whole leg, and there was a frequent pulse, and much general excitement. I removed the thickened cuticle of a corn on one of the toes, and allowed a very small quantity of pus to escape which was col- lected beneath it. This gave immediate relief, and on the following day she was all but well. Several similar cases have fallen under my obser- vation. I have already mentioned that the most common seat of a soft com is in the angle between the little toe and the fourth toe, over the head of the metatarsal bone which supports the latter. Occa- sionally, however, a soft corn occurs elsewhereâ€” as, for example, on the inside of the little toe, opposite to the last joint of the fourth toe. Such corns are even more painful than hard corns, ex- cept when suppuration takes place in the bursa, and then the suffering is less in proportion, as the thickened cuticle of a soft corn admits of dis- tension more easily than that of a hard corn. Under ordinary circumstances, it is easy to give temporary relief to a patient who suffers incon- venience from a hard corn. The thickened cuticle should be removed, so as to lessen the pressure on the parts below ; and this may be accomplished in various ways. First: If the corn be of long standing, and a piece of linen or thin leather spread with some mild plaster (diachylon for example),

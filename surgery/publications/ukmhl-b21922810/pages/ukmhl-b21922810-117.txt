101 DEATH FROM LIGHTNING. h 3 is the history of a man who was instantaneously destroyed by lightning, which made a wound in his neck, and burned the surface of the body, so that the integuments resembled scorched leather. And we may suppose the destruction of the animal body to be even more complete than this, so that every organ and every tissue should be included in it. But a stroke of lightning may also occasion death without injuring (as far as we are capable of per- ceiving) the organization of any part of the body. Wishing to determine in what manner the electric influence operates on these occasions, I instituted the following experiment. An electric battery of six jars being charged with electricity, the shock was made to pass through a guinea-pig, in the longitudinal direction, from the head to the tail. The animal immediately fell on one side, as if stunned. There were convulsive actions of the muscles of the extremities, which however pre- sently ceased. The function of respiration was not interrupted. In a few minutes sensibility was restored, and the animal recovered. In this experiment there were no marks of de- rangement of the vital functions, with the excep- tion of those of the brain; and the animal suf- fered, as he might be expected to suffer, from concussion of the brain. An electric battery of nine jars being charged with electricity, the shock was discharged through another guinea-pig, in the direction from the head to the tail. Immediately the animal fell on one side. There were convulsive actions of the muscles of the limbs, but it uttered no sound ; and although

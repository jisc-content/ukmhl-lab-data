361 MORTIFICATION. prove that the disease which is usually called angina pectoris depends on ossification of the coronary arteries. I will not say that such symp- toms can arise from no other cause, but I know that they do arise from it in many instances. In examining the bodies of persons who died from the disease in question, I have sometimes found ossification of the coronary arteries to so great an extent, that they were converted into complete bony tubes, while there was no disease of any consequence besides. When the coronary arteries are in this condition they may be capable of admitting a moderate supply of blood to the muscular structure of the heart; and as long as the patient makes no unusual exertion, the cir- culation goes on well enough; when, however, the heart is excited to increased action, whether it be during a fit of passion, or in running, or walking up stairs, or lifting weights, then the ossified arteries, being incapable of expanding so as to let in the additional quantity of blood which, under these circumstances, is required, its action stops, and syncope ensues ; and I say, that this exactly corresponds to the sense of weakness and want of muscular power which exists in persons who have the arteries of the legs obstructed or ossified. The insufficient supply of blood to the limb suf- ficiently explains also the sense of numbness, which I mentioned as one of the praemonitory symptoms of the disease. We must refer the pains of which the patient complains to the same source. With respect to the latter symptom, I may further

213 CORNS AND BUNIONS. this last humble, but not unimportant, subject, that I propose to call your attention in the present lecture. A corn is in the first instance a thickening of the cuticle. Whenever the cutis is habitually subjected to the influence of pressure, it secretes a thick and horny cuticle. We find examples of this in the hands of many mechanics, and in the soles of the feet in those who walk much. But every thickening of the cuticle is not a corn, and this name is applicable only to those cases in which the cuticle is thickened over a projecting portion of bone, on which the pressure is, as it were, concentrated. Corns may occur in any part of the body in which this combination of circum- stances exists ; but, for obvious reasons, they are met with in the feet much more commonly than any where else. If shoes were constructed of the shape of the human foot, neither too large nor too small, and making an equal pressure every where, corns and bunions of the feet would never exist. But, unfor- tunately, shoes are seldom made after this fashion, and in ladiesâ€™ shoes especially there are generally two signal defects : first, the extremity of the shoe is much too narrow for that part of the foot (namely, the toes,) which it is to contain ; and, secondly, for the purpose of displaying as much of the foot as possible, the whole of the tarsus and metatarsus is left uncovered, and the pressure of the shoe in front is thrown entirely upon the toes. The toes are thus first squeezed against each other, and then pushed out of their natural position ; and all the p 3

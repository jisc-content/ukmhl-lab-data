MORTIFICATION. 287 simple operation of castration ; and I was disposed to attribute this unfortunate result, in a great degree at least, to the operation having been per- formed immediately after a long course of the tincture of iodine. If inflammation of the skin terminates in mor- tification independently of any antecedent inflam- mation and mortification of the cellular membrane beneath, the inflammation is usually intense, the surface of the skin is of a dark red colour, and there is severe pain and tenderness. As the in- flammation advances the skin assumes a livid appearance ; a serous fluid is thrown out under the cuticle, which is thus elevated in the form of blisters, and then the skin itself perishes. If the mortification takes place to any great extent, the general system suffers. The pulse is feeble, irregular, intermitting; the countenance is anxious; the skin becomes cold ; there is an utter incapa- bility of exertion; and after a few days, and sometimes sooner, the patient dies. If the con- stitution does not suffer in this manner, or if the patient survives the shock, after a few days the separation of the slough begins to take place, and this is the first step towards a complete recovery. In cases of diffuse cellular inflammation, the occurrence of mortification is preceded by an abundant infiltration of serum. In some instances the serum is of a peculiar yellow colour, and the skin over the whole body, and the tunica con- junctiva of the eyes, may assume the same appearance. I do not know to what cause this

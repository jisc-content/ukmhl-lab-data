164 VARICOSE VEINS AND of itching and weight, especially about the inner ankle. The sense of weight and fulness becomes more troublesome when he takes a long walk, and is then, indeed, very distressing. Where there is a varicose cluster, there is in a few instances extraordinary pain, which, as I imagine, arises from there being some nervous filament pressed on by the tumor. Sometimes he com- plains of being subject to cramp in the muscles of the leg, especially after a long walk. Varicose clusters occasionally burst and bleed. I said, in the commencement of the lecture, that the disease is not dangerous, but that is not absolutely and universally correct. There are a few cases in which there is actual danger to life, from haemor- rhage. A varicose cluster becomes larger and larger ; the skin over it becomes more attenuated ; at last it gives way, and there is a discharge of blood. I have heard of patients actually dying from this haemorrhage, where assistance could not be procured ; and I have myself known instances of very large quantities of blood being lost in this manner. Clusters of varicose veins sometimes become inflamed. They are then tender to the touch. Frequently the inflammation is preceded by a rigor, or by an attack of fever. In some instances the inflammation extends to the skin over the cluster. It becomes red; and if the patient stands up, the pain from the inflamed varix is aggravated, but if he lies down, it is in some measure relieved, but not entirely. The great pain in the erect posture is explained by the weight of the column of blood pressing on the tender parts.

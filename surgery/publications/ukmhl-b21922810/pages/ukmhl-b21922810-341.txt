325 MORTIFICATION. y 3 platina spoon, and, when melted, dip into it the blunt end of a probe. It will come out with a var- nish of the caustic upon it; dip it in again until the button of caustic has attained a sufficient size. By means of a probe thus armed you may carry the caustic even into a very narrow wound, so that you are sure it will penetrate wherever the dogâ€™s tooth has penetrated; after which, from the par- ticular nature of the caustic (as I have just explained) you may be certain that it will pene- trate still further, and as far as the poison can have reached. Caustics may often be used very advantageously for the purpose of destroying diseased lymphatic glands. A man has chronic inflammation and enlargement of the glands in the groin, forming a considerable tumor. The skin over them ulcerates, forming, at last, a large ill-conditioned ulcer, which will not heal. The reason of this is plain enough. No ulcer will heal unless it has a healthy basis, and here the basis is a mass of diseased glands. These diseased glands may take a long time to recover themselves ; some months, or even a year; and, as there are plenty of glands to spare, there is no harm in destroying those which are diseased. You may effect this by the caustic potash, but not very well. You want some kind of caustic which will lie in the substance of the diseased glands, and destroy their internal structure, as well as their outer surface. The form of caustic I am going to mention was used by the late Mr. Pearson, from whom I had the prescription. It consists of one ounce of crumb of bread, two drachms of the

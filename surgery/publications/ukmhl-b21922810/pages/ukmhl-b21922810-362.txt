346 MORTIFICATION. penter, and having dropped his rule into the rattlesnakeâ€™s cage, he introduced his hand to take it out, and the snake bit him. He was immediately brought to the hospital in a state approaching to that of syncope, with violent pain extending up the arm. The next day the whole arm was swollen, and the skin looked purple ; there were vesications upon it, as if sloughing were going on in the subcutaneous cellular membrane. The man lingered here for nearly three weeks, and then died. At the time of his death there was extensive mortification, not only of the skin of the fore-arm, but also of the whole of the cellular membrane, from the bitten finger up to the shoulder. From the appearance in the beginning there could be no doubt that the sloughing pro- cess of the cellular membrane had begun imme- diately after the injury was received. The skin itself seemed to have mortified only because it lay over the dead cellular membrane, and, what is curious, the muscles underneath were not at all affected. The poison seems to act (as far as its local operation is concerned) especially on the cel- lular membrane. This was proved not only by this particular tissue sloughing so extensively, but also by this circumstance, that, within an hour after the bite, extravasations of blood (ecchy- moses) might be traced in the cellular membrane as high as the shoulder, and from thence downwards, on the side of the chest, as low as the false ribs, presenting altogether a very singular appearance. The poison, indeed, seemed to operate on the cellular membrane neither in the direction of the

MORTIFICATION. 358 but the right iliac artery, for the extent of three inches, was impervious also, in consequence of it being completely choked by a mass of firmly coagulated blood. In another case, in which there had been mortification of the right foot, the muscular structure of the heart was pale and flaccid; one coronary artery was contracted and impervious ; the cavities were dilated, and a mass of dense coagulum, resembling that found in the sac of an aneurism, occupied the appendix of the left auricle; but there was a similar coagulum obstructing the popliteal artery and vein of the right side, and extending some way down the branches of those vessels in the leg. You are not, however, to suppose that mortifica- tion of the toes is a necessary consequence of ossification or obliteration of the arteries, and that it occurs in all such cases. I have no doubt that many persons have the arteries thus altered in structure for many years, although mortification never supervenes. I have already explained to you, that, in some instances, the arteries are ossified, and at the same time either contracted or ob- literated ; that in others they are obliterated without being ossified ; and again, that in others they are ossified without being obliterated, even * retaining their natural diameter. It is evident that the quantity of blood admitted into the limb must be different under these different circum- stances, and that the liability to mortification must vary accordingly. But further than this: even where the arteries are rendered narrower, or ac- tually obliterated, it seems that in general some-

EFFECTS OF STRANGULATION. 69 f 3 The diaphragm and intercostal muscles, however, continue to act for some time, or rather attempting to act; for as the trachea is obstructed they cannot act to any purpose, so as to enlarge the dimensions of the chest. The period during which these efforts to inspire continue is not the same in all cases. On an average it may be as much as one minute and a half or two minutes; when they cease the pulse of the heart and arteries is still distinctly to be felt, and the action of the heart continues of suf- ficient strength to maintain the circulation for two or three minutes longer. If the ligature be removed from the neck before the contractions of the diaphragm have ceased, air is of course drawn into the lungs; the blood which is still circulating through them becomes decarbon- ized ; scarlet blood passes into the left auricle and ventricle of the heart, and from thence is distributed to the muscular structure of the heart itself, to the brain and spinal chord, and other organs. Respiration continues, and the action of the heart is maintained in the usual manner. Or, if the contractions of the diaphragm have ceased, and in the very short interval during which the heart continues to act afterwards the lungs be inflated, so as to produce artificial respiration, the usual change is produced in the quality of the blood ; the circulation continues ; in the course of a few minutes the animal makes a spontaneous effort to breathe ; other efforts follow, and then, if the artificial respiration be dispensed with, he continues to breathe as under ordinary circumstances.

The patient said that she had had the disease for some years, but that about a week before her admission she had stood for a long time upon a stone floor, on a cold damp day. She went to bed, and had a shivering, which was followed by fever, and then this attack of inflammation of the veins took place. I could feel that the blood had become coagulated. I slit open the upper varix and let out the coagu- lum ; but the varices below were treated with cold lotion, or in some other simple way.

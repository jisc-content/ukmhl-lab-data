284 MORTIFICATION. tions, the death of the entire animal is a speedy, if not an immediate, consequence. If the part affected be one not directly necessary to life, still, if mortification exist to a very considerable extent, so great an impression will be made on the whole system that the same result wTill probably ensue. Otherwise, after a certain period of time, another process becomes established, by which the dead part is separated or thrown off from the living. We distinguish this process, when it occurs in soft parts, by the appellation of sloughing, and the part separated is called a slough. When, however, it occurs in hard parts, as in the bones or car- tilages, we call it the process of exfoliation. Sloughing and exfoliation are accomplished by ulceration of the living parts in contact with the dead. A thin layer of the living parts is absorbed, and the dead part is left lying loose on the ulcerated surface. The period of time required for the completion of the process of mortification differs according to the circumstances under which the mortification takes place. It may be very slow; it may be rapid; it may be almost instantaneous; as I shall explain to you more fully hereafter. The period required for the completion of the after-process of sloughing varies also: First, according to the state of the system, and the activity of the vital powers generally: Secondly, according to the organization of the part in which the disease occurs ; (thus, other circumstances being the same, the sloughing of the skin is much sooner accom- plished than that of tendon, or than the exfoliation

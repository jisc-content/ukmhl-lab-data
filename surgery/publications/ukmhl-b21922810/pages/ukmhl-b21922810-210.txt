194 SCIRRHOUS TUMORS OF THE BREAST proper, and under what circumstances is it im- proper ? I should observe here, in the first instance, that while a great deal depends upon the nature of the case, something will depend upon yourselves, and upon the mode of performing the operation. If there be a scirrhous tumor imbedded in the gland of the breast, and you remove the tumor and a piece of the breast in which it is imbedded, and leave the rest of the breast, according to my experience the disease will certainly return; and this corresponds to a rule which applies to all cases of malignant disease,â€”that you have no security from an operation for its removal, unless you remove the whole of the organ in which the disease is seated. If, for instance, there be fungus hcematodes of the bone of the leg, the patient may have some chance of doing well if you amputate the thigh above the knee; while, if there be malignant disease of the femur, he has almost no chance, unless, indeed, you think it worth while to take out the bone at the hip-joint. I say, therefore, that in cases of scirrhous tumor of the breast, where the tumor is actually imbedded in the breast, if you perform the operation you must remove the whole of the breast. You may imagine that this is a very easy thing to be done, but it is not so easy in reality; for in amputating the breast, you will be very apt, in a thin person, if you are not very careful, to leave small slices of the gland of the breast adhering to the skin, and I have no doubt that the part or parts thus left behind in some cases have formed the nidus

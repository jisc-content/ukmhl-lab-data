83 EFFECTS OF STRANGULATION. What remains to be said of the treatment after strangulation may be comprised in a few words. It has been recommended that blood should be taken by vensesection, or in some other way. But in the case of the patient treated by Mr. Rose this was done without any apparent advantage. I am not aware that there is any actual experience in favour of this practice; still, as congestion of the vessels of the brain may be one of the effects of strangulation, I do not feel myself justified in say- ing that it is never proper. The practitioner must be directed by the circumstances of each individual case, forming his judgment especially from the state of the pulse, but bearing in mind that the circula- tion of dark-coloured blood, during however short a period of time, cannot have taken place without a diminution of the powers of life, and that if blood be taken at all it should be done prudently and cautiously. Another remedy has been recommended in the shape of the warm bath; but I cannot doubt that whatever advantage it may afford, may be obtained by keeping the patient in an atmosphere of a moderately warm temperature. In fact, whenever the effects of strangulation are of long continu- ance, this is absolutely necessary to compensate for the insufficient generation of animal heat, which is the consequence of the impaired state of the functions of the brain, whether arising from the influence of a narcotic poison, or from another cause.

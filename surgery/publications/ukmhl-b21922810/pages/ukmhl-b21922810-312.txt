MORTIFICATION. 296 observations lead me to suspect that large doses of ammonia, if persevered in for a considerable time, tend to depress the vital powers, and lessen the chances of recovery. Opium is useful under certain circumstances ; as where there is severe pain, or where the inflammation and mortification depend on the operation of a specific poison. I have already had occasion (with a view to explain the pathological phenomena of mortifica- tion) to advert to the effects of incisions made through the skin into the cellular membrane, when the cells of the latter are exceedingly distended with serum. Whether the explanation which I then ventured to offer of the mode in which this serous infiltration operates in producing mortifica- tion be or be not correct, there can be no doubt that the evacuation of the serum, and the conse- quent relief of tension, will go far towards pre- venting an extensive mortification in all cases, and will prevent it altogether in a great many. It is not, however, always necessary for this purpose that we should make scarifications or incisions. Mere acupunctures are not unfrequently sufficient. I have, on many occasions, requested the house surgeon of this hospital to make punctures where this serous infiltration of the cellular membrane was going on, every morning and evening, or whenever he found occasion to do so ; and it often has happened that nothing more was required. But, of course, this simple practice is useful only in an early stage of the disease,â€”where there is that state of things which may lead to mortification, but where mortification has not actually taken place.

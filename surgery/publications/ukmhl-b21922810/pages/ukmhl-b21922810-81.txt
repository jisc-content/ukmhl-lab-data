EFFECTS OF STRANGULATION. 65 heart, and why the same thing would happen even if it were possible that the irritability of the mus- cular fibres should remain unimpaired. There is only one fact which in the first instance may seem to be opposed to this conclusion. The heart, com- pletely separated from its connexions, and even removed from the body, will continue for a time to contract, and the contractions will be as orderly and as vigorous as if, after it was emptied of its blood, it had been allowed to remain in the thorax with its connexions undisturbed. Of this, however, an easy explanation may be offered, namely, that the nerves of the heart are something more than mere conductors of the nervous influence, and that they retain the power of stimulating the fibres to contract for a certain period after they have been detached from the nervous centres.* * These views relating to the circulation are taken from the Croonian lecture which I communicated to the Royal Society in the year 1814. The lecture was directed by the Council to be inserted in the Philosophical Transactions; but the publi- cation was deferred at my request, as I did not consider the investigation to be sufficiently matured to be laid before the public. Since the present volume was prepared for the press I have been made acquainted with Mr. Beck’s researches respec- ting the nerves of the abdomen ; the importance of which in reference to the subject treated of above is sufficiently obvious. In Mr. Beck’s dissection it is clearly shown that the branches of the splanchnic nerves are respectively accompanied by pro- cesses or elongations of the grey material of the nervous system; and Mr. Beck has informed me that he has ascertained that the nerves of the cardiac plexus possess the same compound structure. This being the case there can be little doubt that the cardiac nerves possess the property which I have attributed to them of generating the nervous influence. F

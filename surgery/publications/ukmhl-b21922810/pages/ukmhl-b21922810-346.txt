330 MORTIFICATION. these vascular spots in every instance ; and there is another, and a still more certain, method of pro- ceeding. Puncture the principal vessel from which the others radiate with a lancet, and then intro- duce into the puncture, merely for a single instant, a piece of caustic potash, scraped into the form of a pencil, with a very fine point. Touch it, I say, for a moment only; this will be quite sufficient. But even after so slight an application, you will find that the caustic has also burned the margin of the skin, and, unless you adopt other measures, a trifling mark will be left. All that is required is the application of a very little vinegar, by means of a camelâ€™s hair brush. There are some congenital noevi which are altogether cutaneous. There is a very intricate plexus of little vessels in the skin, filled with scarlet blood, which, being elevated above the surface of the surrounding skin, a ssumes an appear- ance which may be compared to that of a rasp- berry. If a noevus-of this kind be of large size it must be removed by the knife or by a ligature, but if it be small you may destroy it very well with caustic. You should not employ the caustic potash, which would produce bleeding, but rather have recourse to nitric acid, which destroys the noevus sufficiently, while at the same time it coagulates the blood in the small vessels, rendering the noevus more solid than it was before. With a piece of stick or a probe armed with lint, and dipped in the acid, paint the surface of the noevus, taking care that you include the whole, without burning the neighbouring parts. This makes a

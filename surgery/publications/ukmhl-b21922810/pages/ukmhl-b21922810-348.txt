MORTIFICATION. 332 end of it into nitrate of silver melted in a platina or silver spoon. The probe thus armed is to be introduced into the puncture made by the narrow lancet, and moved about, so that wherever the lancet has divided the blood-vessels the caustic may penetrate also. It causes inflammation and slough- ing, at the same time obliterating the vessels be- yond the margin of the slough. When the slough is separated there is a slight discharge of pus for a few days, and if the tumor be of small size you will find that it is cured; but if it be large the application must be repeated. I have used this on several occasions with great advantage, especially when the tumor has been on the face, where it was a great object not to destroy the skin. If you remove one of these tumors either by the knife or by ligature, you must in either case leave a large cicatrix. But by applying the caustic in the way which I have mentioned you save the skin. I was requested to see a little child that had one of these subcutaneous noevi at the tip of the nose, giving it a very ugly appearance. By far the greater part of the alae of the nose was involved in the tumor, and to have cut it out would have disfigured the child for life.

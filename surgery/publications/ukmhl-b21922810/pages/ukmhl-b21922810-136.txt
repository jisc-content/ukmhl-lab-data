120 UNUNITED FRACTURES. femur, within the capsule, can take place, under any circumstances; but I need not enter into the consideration of it at present. We may be satisfied that the union of such a fracture is, at all events, a very rare occurrence, and that it does not unite in the same way as ordinary fractures. The structures in which this particular fracture occurs explain the circumstance. The neck of the femur within the articular capsule has a synovial mem- brane, but there is none of that mass of cellular membrane and muscles surrounding it in which the process of union begins, where the fracture is in the shaft of the bone. If any other explanation wrere wanted we might refer to the small quantity of blood which probably would enter the head of the bone for the purpose of nutrition after the accident had occurred. If a fracture were to occur in any other bone, which is covered, as the neck of the femur is, only by a reflection of the synovial membrane, I presume that the result would be the same. In the human subject there is scarcely any other bone in which such a thing can happen. There are, however, some bones which may be broken under similar circumstances in animals. While I was engaged in the series of experiments to which I have already referred, the fractures were made, as chance directed, sometimes in one situation, sometimes in another; for, of course, you cannot make a fracture just where you wish to make it. In one experiment, the bones of the leg of a guinea-pig were broken close to the ankle- joint. The tibia in these animals is covered by a reflection of the synovial membrane, which extends

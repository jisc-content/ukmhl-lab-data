MORTIFICATION. 290 natural diameter. In like manner, when muscles are in exercise, or when a gland is pouring forth an abundant secretion, the capillaries become dilated so as to admit the increased quantity of blood which, in consequence of the greater activity of the organ, is required ; but no one pretends to say that they are therefore in a state of debility; and I see no difference, in this respect, between these cases and that of inflammation. But micro- scopic examination proves something more than the mere dilatation of the capillaries. 44 The blood “ itself is affected. It loses its globular structure ; 44 and, previously to this, the globules themselves “ are observed to have lost their repulsive proper- 44 ties, and either to agglomerate together or to 44 adhere to the sides of the vessel in which they 44 are contained, and not unfrequently they seem to 44 stagnate, so as to choke up the vessel altogether, 4 4 and destroy the circulation in it.” Now if this happens in many of the capillaries it is plain that the vitality of the part cannot be maintained, and thus the occurrence of mortification is easily explained. Other circumstances, however, may continue to produce the same result. For example, let us suppose a case of inflammation of the cellular tissue of the scrotum. The cells are filled with serum. They are fully distended, and the skin is on the stretch. If nothing be done to the part, the cellular membrane first, and the skin after- wards, will mortify to a great extent; but make a few incisions with the point of a lancet, serum escapes in sufficient quantity to relieve the tension, and the mortification is in great measure,

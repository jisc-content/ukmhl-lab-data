ADIPOSE TUMORS. 274 recommend the operation at this period: first,, be- cause the tumor may never increase, and as long as it is small it is of no consequence ; and, secondly, because the operation is really more easy when the tumor has reached a moderate size than it is at an earlier period. Still it is desirable that the opera- tion should not be deferred until the tumor is very large, lest the pressure of the skin in its distended state should cause adhesions to be formed between the thin membrane in which the fatty substance is enclosed and the neighbouring parts. Where such adhesions exist the operation is comparatively difficult, and there is always a danger of some portion of the tumor being left behind. Under ordinary circumstances the removal of the tumor is, to those who understand the subject, one of the simplest operations in surgery. Make a free inci- sion, not upon the tumor, but fairly into its sub- stance. Do not spare the incision of the skin, but let it extend from one end of the tumor to the other. Then lay aside the knife, and you will find that you can easily detach the tumor, cyst, and all, from the neighbouring textures, drawing out one lobe after another, until you find at last an attachment at one comer, where the vessels enter. Here the knife is again required, and there are generally one or two arteries to be secured by the ligature. There is for the most part no bleeding in any other part of the operation. When the tumor is situated under a muscle the operation is to be performed in the same manner, except that the muscle must be freely divided across its fibres in the first instance.

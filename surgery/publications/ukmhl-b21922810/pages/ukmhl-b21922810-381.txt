You will not be surprised, that, under these circumstances, a great many different modes of treatment have been proposed. Where there is a disease that always gets well under a certain system, medical men have little inducement to make experiments; and those whose greatest anxiety it is to cure their patients make none at alb But in an intractable disease like this it is natural that practitioners should be always looking out for new remedies.

In the first place, those who have observed that the disease is preceded by inflammation, have said, “ Bleed the patient; treat it like an inflammatory “ disease.” I have no doubt that some have been led to recommend this, from a mistake respecting the pathology of the disease which I noticed in the last lecture ; that is, from having supposed that this peculiar kind of mortification of the toes depends on inflammation of the arteries.

MORTIFICATION. 375 b b 4 admitted as a question, whether the keeping the limb wrapped up in the carded wool, which is like keeping it in a vapour bath, may not ultimately produce some beneficial change in the condition of the diseased arteries; not indeed removing the phosphate of lime, which is deposited in their structure, but leading to their becoming gradually and slowly expanded, so as to allow of a more liberal supply of blood to the limb. Whether this suspicion be or be not well founded, I suppose that no one will doubt that it will be prudent in all cases to advise the patient after his recovery always to wear a thick fleecy hosiery stocking; or to use some other kind of warm clothing, with a view to preserve the limb from the influence of the external cold. I must add a very few words respecting the treatment during the process of separation of the dead parts. Bark, quinine, and other tonics, may be proper now, though they were not so before. Wine and a generous diet are still required ; and some stimulating dressings, such as the unguentum elemi compositum, may be useful applications to the sores.

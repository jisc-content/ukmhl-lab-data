EFFECTS OF STRANGULATION. 74 process be properly conducted, a few minutes will be sufficient to restore the pulse, and in a few minutes more the diaphragm will begin to act spontaneously, and then the artificial respiration may be dispensed with. But you cannot lose sight of your patient, never- theless. I have already explained that the circula- tion of the dark-coloured blood through the brain leaves behind it the effects which are produced by a narcotic poison. The patient may remain in a state of coma, breathing laboriously and with stertor. By-and-by the breathing may cease altogether, and here, then, is a second period, at which artificial respiration may be necessary to preserve his life ; and the fact is that it can scarcely ever happen, even in the course of a long practice, that you will have the opportunity of employing artificial respiration during the first of these periods, while you may every now and then find it necessary to have recourse to it during the second. The mode of conducting artificial respiration claims our attention next; and I am tempted to extend my observations on it, because I find but little information on the subject in books, and because there are other occasions besides those of persons labouring under the effects of strangulation, in which it may be required. In some animals, as in the rabbit, a considerable quantity of air may be made to enter the lungs by merely elevating the ribs. Something maj> be done by the same process in the human subject, but certainly not sufficient for the maintenance of life. The only effectual method of supplying the want

68 EFFECTS OF STRANGULATION. the chest, may be reinduced on it being exposed to the air. But these are no more capable of carrying on the circulation of the blood, than the irregular contractions of the muscles of the limbs, produced by a voltaic battery, are of causing an animal to rise and walk. These two kinds of movements are easily to be distinguished from each other. Yet the distinction has often not been made, and the want of it has led to many errors, both of theory and of practice. The first symptoms which are observed in a hanged animal are a dark colour of the lips and nose, and of other parts in which the hue of the blood can be observed, the result at once of venous congestion and of the want of oxygena- tion of the blood. Then there are involuntary actions of the mus- cles, producing convulsions which are frightful to those who behold them, but of which there is no reason to believe that they are indicative of pain more than the convulsions of an epileptic fit. If at this period the eyes be touched, there is no motion of the eyelids ; and those who have recovered from the effects of strangulation have no recollection of their having been in a state of suffering. The contact of the dark-coloured blood with the brain and spinal chord sufficiently ex- plains the involuntary spasmodic actions of the muscles ; and from all that we can learn on the subject, there is great reason to believe that the sensibility of those organs is destroyed at a very early period.

348 MORTIFICATION. Mortification from Exposure to Cold. As parts may be killed by excessive heat, so they may be killed by excessive cold. You might suppose that cold would produce the death of a part, in the following manner: that it would freeze it; and that the fluids, being frozen, and, to a certain extent, expanded in the act of freezing, the organization of the capillary vessels would be destroyed, and death of the part ensue ; in the same manner as in plants and trees, which are killed by a severe frost. Two or three years ago, when there was some very mild weather, like that of spring, about Christmas, in many places the sap began to circulate in the evergreen trees. But this premature spring was followed by some days of most intense cold. The sap was suddenly frozen in the alburnum; and, as it froze, it ex- panded, and burst the vessels, and killed the trees, by destroying their organization. I said that you might suppose, at first, that death from cold is produced in a similar way in the animal body. I cannot say that such never is the case, but I do not find that that is the way in which it usually happens. When a part is frost-bitten, it is not, in general, killed at once ; but, after being exposed to a warmer temperature, it inflames, and the inflammation immediately terminates in gangrene. I imagine that the influence of cold upon the animal body is scarcely ever so instantaneous as at once to freeze the fluid in the vessels; there is almost always time for them to contract and become emptied of their blood before the parts

MORTIFICATION. 349 are frozen. You may see this in your own fingers ; when they have been exposed, on a cold day, they become quite shrunk and pale, as if there were no blood in them, and may remain in this state for a very long time. If, in a case of frost-bite, you go to the fire, to warm the affected part, there is a sudden reaction; inflammation is set up, and mortification follows. In this country we have very little experience of these cases. Every now and then, indeed, a patient is brought into the hospital, who has lost a part of his foot, perhaps two or three toes, in this manner, but not until some time after the mischief was done; and we, therefore, do not see the process by which the death of the part has been produced. There are, however, abundant accounts of death from frost- bite, furnished by persons who have been in cli- mates colder than ours. I may refer, especially, to a work by M. Beaupre, a French surgeon, who followed the Emperor Napoleon in the Russian campaign. By his account, it would appear, that parts may be under the influence of cold for a great length of time, so as to be completely deprived of sensibility, and yet, with prudent management, may recover perfectly. He states, that he has frequently had his feet benumbed, while riding on horseback, so that, for a long time, they had been devoid of sensation, and that he has got off his horse, without knowing whether they touched the ground, or not; but, that by rubbing them with snow, and thus, very gradually, restor- ing them to a proper temperature, the evil con- sequences of frost-bite were prevented.

397 CHRONIC ABSCESS OF THE TIBIA. will see how much the lower end of it is enlarged, and that the surface of it presents marks of great vascularity. The bone in the preparation is divided longitudinally, and just above the arti- culating surface there is a cavity as large as a small chesnut. This cavity was filled with dark- coloured pus. The inner surface of it is smooth. The bone immediately surrounding it is harder than natural. The examination of the limb ex- plained all the symptoms. The abscess of the tibia was constantly stretching the bone in which it was formed, or rather, if I may use the expression, trying to stretch it, and thus caused the violent pain which the patient suffered. On observing these appearances, I could not help saying, that if we had known the real nature of the disease, the limb might have been saved. A trephine would have made an opening in the tibia, and have let out the matter. It would have been merely applying the treatment here that we adopt in cases of abscess elsewhere. You open a painful abscess of the arm with a lancet; you cannot open an abscess of the bone with a lancet, but you may do so with a trephine. About two years after the occurrence of this case, I was consulted by another patient, twenty- three years of age, who had an enlargement of the upper end of the tibia, extending to some distance below the knee. He suffered a great deal of pain ; the part was very tender, and there were all the symptoms of chronic periostitis. I made an incision over the part, dividing every thing down to the bone, and found the periosteum very much

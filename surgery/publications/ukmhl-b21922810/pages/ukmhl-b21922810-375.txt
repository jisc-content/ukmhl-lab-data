359 MORTIFICATION. a a 4 thing more must happen to bring on mortification; and you will almost invariably find that the imme- diate cause is an attack of inflammation. Perhaps the following is not an unreasonable explanation of the phenomena which occur. The arteries are ossified, or they are partially obliterated, but still a sufficient quantity of blood for ordinary purposes enters the limb. By and by, from some cause or another, the foot becomes inflamed. I observed to you, in a former lecture, that during inflam- mation an increased supply of arterial blood seems to be required, and that the arterial trunks leading to the inflamed part become dilated, so as to allow this increased quantity of blood to enter; but if the arteries are ossified they lose the power of dilatation ; the greater supply of blood required in consequence of the inflammation is withheld, and so the part perishes. You might suppose, a priori, that persons in the lower condition of life, wTho live by their daily labour, and suffer bodily privations, would be more liable to mortification of the toes than other persons; but such is not the case; at least it has fallen to my lot to see comparatively few examples of this disease in the hospital, whereas, in private practice, I have met with a great number; so that for one case under my care in the former, I have had at least three or four in the latter. It is one of the many penalties paid by those who enjoy the advantages of ease and affluence, and who live luxuriously.

118 UNUNITED FRACTURES. ter are visible, deposited in it here and there ; and at the same time some of the callus seems to dis- appear on the outside, so that the neighbouring muscles and tendons adhere to it no longer. The specks of bone become more numerous, and larger, until they extend into each other; and thus by degrees the whole of the callus is converted into bone. This drawing represents the appearance of a fracture thirty days after the injury. It is taken from the broken leg of a guinea-pig, and you will perceive that the ossification of the callus is com- plete. Even at this period, however, there is not absolute bony union, for although the whole of the callus has become bone, it is not yet so identified with the old bone, but that you may still pick it off with a penknife, leaving the broken extremities not materially altered from what they were immediately after the injury. This may be regarded as the end of the second stage of the process by which a fracture is repaired. Now a third series of changes begins to take place. The broken extremities of the bone become intimately united by bony matter passing from one to the other. The mass of new bone on the outside, formed by the ossification of the callus, being no longer wanted is absorbed. By degrees, the whole of it disappears, and the bone is left, having the dimensions which it had before the occurrence of the accident. All these changes are plainly to be seen in the preparations and drawings on the table. Thus it appears that the process by which fractures become united under ordinary circum-

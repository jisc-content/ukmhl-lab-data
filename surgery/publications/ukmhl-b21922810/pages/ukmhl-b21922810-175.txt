I will explain to you, by and by, why they occur in some situations more than in others. But varicose veins occasionally occur in other parts of the body. I have seen varicose veins of the fore-arm to a con- siderable extent. In the case to which I allude, there had been inflammation of the median cephalic and cephalic vein.

166 VARICOSE VEINS AND other piles may form, but the first is cured, and never troubles the patient again. By degrees the inflammation subsides ; the coagulum becomes gradually absorbed; as the absorption proceeds, the sides of the vein approximate, and it assumes the appearance of a narrow cord. In old cases of varicose veins, you will frequently find the skin become affected with a chronic inflam- mation ; that is, it will look red, and be very irri- table and tender. Sometimes the cuticle is as it were abraded, and an ichorous discharge takes place from the red cutis. Occasionally the whole of the skin of the leg is in this condition. In other cases there is a chronic inflammation of the cellular membrane. There is an effusion of serum into it, and the limb becomes oedematous. When there is disease of the heart, preventing the due passage of the blood through its cavities, the fluid part of the blood is liable to escape from the capillary vessels, and thus you have anasarca of the legs. But the swelling which takes place in varicose veins does not exactly correspond to ana- sarca connected with disease of the heart. It is the result of an inflammatory action in the cellular membrane; and the fluid has a more distinctly serous character. If you puncture the parts with a needle, the fluid, being of greater consistence, does not flow out so rapidly as the thinner fluid which escapes after puncture in a case of anasarca. The inflammation of the skin, and the inflam- mation of the cellular membrane, in these cases correspond with each other. There is an exuda- tion of serum in one case from the surface of the

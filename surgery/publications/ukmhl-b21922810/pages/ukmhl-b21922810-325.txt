309 MORTIFICATION. x 3 a case in which the spinal chord is injured in the middle of the back, you may find, almost before you suspect that there is any thing wrong, a great slough over the sacrum,—nay, the pressure of the mattrass on the ankles, will, in such cases, produce the same mischief. I have known mortifi- cation begin in the ankle within twrenty-four hours after an injury of the spine ; and a remarkable circumstance it seems to be, that injuries of the spinal chord should thus lessen the vital powers, so as to make the patient liable to mortification, when we consider how many circumstances there are that would lead us to doubt whether the nerves have any influence over the capillary circulation. The circulation, viewed by a microscope, in a frog’s foot, goes on just the same whether the nerves are divided or not. In an experiment which I was making on poisons, I divided all the nerves in a dog’s axilla; I then divided not only the skin which was attached to the anterior extremity, but also the muscles and cellular membrane, so that there was an absolute want of union between the extremity and the trunk, except by means of the axillary artery and vein, which I left untouched. The animal, at the expiration of twenty-four hours, was killed, but the limb maintained its vitality all the time. In spite, however, of this and of other circumstances which I might mention of the same kind, even a concussion of the spinal marrow will make the patient liable to mortification of the parts below. Patients are more or less disposed to mortifica- tion from pressure, accordingly as they are more

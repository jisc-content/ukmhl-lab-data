59 EFFECTS OF STRANGULATION. 3. It is not to be supposed that the pressure of the cord on the nerves of the neck can be the immediate cause of death, as the most important of these nerves (the pneumogas trie) may be com- pletely divided, and yet the animal may survive the injury for a considerable time. It is not, however, very improbable, that if an individual were to recover from the first effects of strangula- tion, he might suffer from the injury done to the nerves afterwards. The animal which was the sub- ject of the experiment which has been just related died on the following day. On dissection, I could discover nothing unusual in the brain ; but the lungs were dark-coloured, and turgid with blood, presenting an appearance a good deal similar to what I have observed in animals who have died after the division of the pneumogastric nerves. That a temporary pressure on a nerve should leave the functions of the nerve impaired for a certain period is no more than what happens in many other cases ; for example:â€”A gentleman met with an accident which caused a dislocation of the shoulder. The dislocation, as I was in- formed, was not easily reduced, the patient being for a considerable time under the operation. The extending force had been applied above the elbow, and when I saw the patient, two or three days and carotid arteries of a rabbit, near their origin, are so situated that it is easy to make pressure on them at the same time. The result of such pressure is, that the animal appears to die instantaneously. But the heart continues to act, and by immediately having recourse to artificial respiration he is restored to life, as after strangulation.

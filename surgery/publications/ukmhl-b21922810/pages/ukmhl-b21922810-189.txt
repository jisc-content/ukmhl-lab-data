ULCERS OF THE LEGS. 173 if it formed the whole of it, it would be liable to the same objection as the caoutchouc roller, namely, that of not affording sufficient support, especially in warm climates and in hot weather. The foregoing observations relate to the general treatment of varicose veins, and of the simpler form of the disease. We are next to consider the treatment under peculiar circumstances. Let us suppose, then, that you are called to a patient in whom there is a varicose cluster of veins in a state of inflammation. There is a great deal of tenderness in the part, and perhaps some fever. The first thing you have to do is to keep the patient in bed, in the horizontal posture, so as to keep the veins emptied of their blood. Then, if there be much inflammation, and the patient suffers a good deal of pain, he may derive benefit from the local abstraction of blood. You may have recourse to leeches. Do not, however, apply them immediately over the veins ; they should be applied higher up on the leg, on the sound skin. The bite of a leech over an inflamed vein wTill give the patient a good deal of pain, and the little wound will be difficult to heal. If you apply the leeches on the sound skin in the thigh, or the upper part of the leg, you will relieve the varicose veins just as much as if you had applied them on the veins themselves, without giving the patient pain at the time or trouble afterwards. A compress wet with cold lotion may be laid on the varix, unless the pain be very great, in which case fomen- tations and poultices may be had recourse to instead.

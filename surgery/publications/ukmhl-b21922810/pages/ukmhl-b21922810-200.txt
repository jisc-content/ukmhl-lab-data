184 VARICOSE VEINS AND few cases he applied it to the vena saphena minor. When I was a student, nothing was more common than to see a patient with varicose veins standing on a table, and leaning over the back of a chair, for the purpose of undergoing the operation. The skin was divided ; a silver needle, with a ligature, was passed under the vein, and the vein was tied. In many instances, at first, no ill consequences ensued; but by and by a private patient of Sir Everard Home became affected with venous inflam- mation, and died. The same thing then occurred in another patient. When I was house-surgeon here, there were two women on whom the opera- tion was performed, in each of whom venous inflammation, attended by typhoid symptoms, supervened. Fortunately they did not die, but they certainly had a very narrow escape. The operation was performed by other surgeons, and in their hands also it was found that every now and then venous inflammation was induced, which ended fatally; and it was then very generally abandoned. Mr. Abernethy remarked:—“ I dare “ say it is only the ligature that brings on the “ inflammation. You divide veins when you am- “ putate, and they do not become inflamed ; why “ should you not merely cut across the vena “ saphena, and put on pressure ? ” He was mis- taken in his view of the subject, which was not indeed much understood by surgeons at that time. W"e now know that veins after amputation not unfrequently inflame, and that this is one of the causes of death after amputation. When I was first assistant-surgeon, there was a man with very

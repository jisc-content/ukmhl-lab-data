In eight minutes he began to move his shoulders ; and in four minutes more he articulated some incoherent words ; but an hour and a half elapsed before he had entirely recovered his senses. This patient appears to have been under the care of Dr. Struve, a German physician, who published a treatise on the art of restoring suspended animation. He was bathed in cold water; and then covered over with earth, which was laid upon him six inches in thickness ; vinegar was poured down his throat, and the powers of his constitution enabled him to recover, in despite of the doctorâ€™s remedies. It appears to me that the facts which I have been able to collect relating to this subject lead to this conclusion, that the influence of lightning, or of a powerful shock of electricity, in the majority of cases, is expended chiefly in disturbing, or destroying, the functions of the brain ; and the treatment necessary to counteract the effects of the injury may be comprised in a few words. Expose the body to a moderate warmth, so as to prevent the loss of animal heat, to which it is always liable where the functions of the brain are suspended or impaired, and inflate the lungs, so as to imitate natural respiration as nearly as pos- sible, whenever the animal breathes with labour or difficulty, or when he has ceased to breathe altogether by his own efforts.

179 ULCERS OF THE LEGS. n 2 circumstances is very nearly the same as that which is necessary where there is the mere superficial inflammation of which I have just spoken. The patient should be kept in the horizontal posture ; blood may be taken either from the vena saphena major, or by leeches from the thigh, and generally you will find the latter quite sufficient. You may apply a cold lotion in the first instance, but very soon you should begin to apply a bandage, such as will give an uniform support to the leg from the toes to the knee. In some cases in which the cellular membrane has become infiltrated with serum to such an extent as to cause more than ordinary swelling of the limb, and tension of the integuments, some immediate relief may be obtained by making punc- tures with a needle (a common worsted needle is the best), as in cases of anasarca. As, however, I have already observed, the fluid, being serum, and the result of inflammation, is different from that of anasarca.

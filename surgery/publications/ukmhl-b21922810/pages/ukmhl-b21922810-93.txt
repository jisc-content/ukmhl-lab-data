77 EFFECTS OF STRANGULATION. A graduated syringe would tell you nothing, unless the tube of inflation were so closely fitted to the trachea that no air could escape by its side. The introduction of a tube into the trachea, in this class of cases, is not only not at all required, but it is much less convenient than the introduc- tion of it into the nostril. The double bellows, which some have recommended formerly, is neither more nor less than a gross absurdity. In the course of my physiological investigations I have had a large experience in the employment of artificial respiration in animals; and I have had some experience of it (though a small one as com- pared with that in animals) in the human subject; and I shall be able in a few words to inform you of the result of my observations on the subject. Where the respiration is obstructed by inflam- mation and swelling of the mucous membrane of the pharynx and larynx, or by a tumour in this situation, the lungs can be inflated only by means of a tube introduced into the trachea. It some- times may, and sometimes may not, be possible to introduce a curved silver tube into the rima glottidis; but it is a little difficult to do so under the most favourable circumstances, and I conclude that there is always danger that a foreign body in the glottis will excite irritation, as soon as the sensibility of the patient is restored. The sim- plest mode of proceeding is to make an opening with a double-edged scalpel in the space between the cricoid and thyroid cartilages, this situation being more convenient (where time is valuable) than one lower down, on account of the smaller

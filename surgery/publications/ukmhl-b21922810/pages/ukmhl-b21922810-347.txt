MORTIFICATION. 331 slough of the surface of the noevus, and at the same time causes the blood to coagulate in the small vessels below, and thus renders them im- pervious. But, let me repeat that this method is applicable only where the ncevi are of small size. There are subcutaneous noevi formed by vas- cular tumors in the texture under the skin, and not in the skin itself. These put on a different appearance from the cutaneous noevi before men- tioned. The blood here is seen, not of a scarlet, but of a purple colour, because the skin lies over it. These may be destroyed by caustic when they are of small size ; and even when they are of large size, if it be a great object to avoid the scar which - must exist after the removal of them by the knife or by ligature. These vascular noevi have some- times been cured by vaccination. Half a dozen punctures have been made with a lancet armed with vaccine lymph. The pustules being crowded together in the noevus, a good deal of inflamma- tion has ensued, with some degree of sloughing, and between the two the noevus has been cured. But you cannot depend on this method; at least so I am informed by those who have practised it, for I have not tried it much myself; but you may, acting on the same principle, very easily cure such a noevus by caustic. For this purpose I have a very narrow knife, perhaps about the eighth of an inch in width; I introduce it into the middle of the noevus, and move it in different directions, so as to cut to pieces, as it were, its vascular structure. I then have a probe armed by dipping the blunt

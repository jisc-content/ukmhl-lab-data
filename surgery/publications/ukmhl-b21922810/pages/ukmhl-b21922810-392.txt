MORTIFICATION. 376 LECTURE XX. ON MORTIFICATION—continued. Mortification of the Integuments of the Leg. There are cases of mortification of the integuments of the legs which appear to correspond very nearly to those of mortification of the toes, of which I treated in the last lecture. There is, however, sufficient difference between these two classes of cases to justify me in noticing them separately. Mortification of the integuments of the legs is of more frequent occurrence than mortification of the toes. We meet with it earlier in life, and in those who have less distinct marks of old age upon them; at the same time that the chances of recovery are greater in the former than they are in the latter. Undoubtedly, mortification of the leg (as well as mortification of the toes) frequently has its origin in organic disease of the vascular system. But then I find reason to believe that it takes place in many cases independently of organic disease of any kind,—as in persons who are merely lowered and exhausted by previous illness, and whose heart does not act with sufficient power, because it partakes of the general debility. Such persons may and do recover perfectly, living for years afterwards without any symptoms of organic disease showing themselves.

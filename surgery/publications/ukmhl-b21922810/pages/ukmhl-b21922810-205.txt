ULCERS OF THE LEGS. 189 cluster. A good deal of haemorrhage follows, but the pressure of a compress at once commanded it, and a bandage was applied afterwards. The wound, in most instances, healed by the first intention. The varicose veins were obliterated, and usually in a few days the patient suffered no inconvenience from the operation. However, in some cases, the wound suppurated, instead of healing by the first intention, which protracted the cure. In some instances in which I had recourse to this operation, a remarkable occurrence took place. Although I was satisfied that the cluster was divided, the disease was not cured. It seemed as if the veins healed without becoming obliterated. As the ductus clioledochus, or the intestinal canal, will heal after the application of a ligature, without the continuity of the canal being destroyed, so it appears to be with divided veins under certain circumstances. I published in the Medico-Chirurgical Transac- tions an account of this operation, in the year 1817, and I believe that it affords the first example of the subcutaneous operation, which is now so suc- cessfully employed in other cases. As applied to varicose veins the operation is as easy and as safe as it is on other occasions, yet I scarcely ever have recourse to it now. With my present experience, it really appears to me that in ordinary cases it is not worth the patientâ€™s while to submit to it, as I always observed that, if I cured one cluster, two smaller ones appeared, one on each side, and that, ultimately, I left the patient no better than I found him.

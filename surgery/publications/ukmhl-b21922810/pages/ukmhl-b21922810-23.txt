Such is the connection of the different parts of* the animal system, and so dependent are they on each other, that it would be hazardous to regard the knowledge of any one of them as altogether useless. But there are some parts of which a general knowledge is all that is required. It would be an unprofitable waste of time to trace all the artificial divisions which may be made of the deep- seated muscles of the spine, or the varieties which occur in the minute ramifications of the veins and arteries.

During the first season of your education, you will find that the labour of acquiring a competent knowledge of anatomy is such that you will have but little time to bestow on other studies. The

208 SCIRRHOUS TUMORS OF THE BREAST But where the breast is small; where the patient is otherwise healthy, and not much advanced in life ; and where you do not starve the patient, either before the operation or after it; and are also careful that there shall be as little loss of blood as possible ;â€”there the danger of the operation is comparatively trifling. I have hitherto spoken of the operation for the removal of scirrhous tumors of the breast; but the breast is liable to other malignant diseases, and the observations which I have just made apply to these cases as wrell as to the others. I think, how- ever, that where the malignant disease of the breast has the form of fungus hcematodes, the chance of ultimate success is even less than where the disease has the form of scirrhus. Fungus hcematodes is a worse form of malignant disease than scirrhus; and in most of the cases of it which I have seen in the breast, where the tumor has been removed by operation, the patient has died in a short time afterwards of disease of the lungs and effusion into the pleurae. But, after all, I believe that the disease is essentially the same, whether it assume the form of scirrhus, or fungus haematodes, or pancreatic sarcoma. Whatever may be the names given to them by pathologists, you may be assured that malignant diseases are all nearly related to each other; and that the remarks which are applicable to one are very generally applicable to the rest. As we have sufficient time before us, I shall take the opportunity of mentioning some cases in illustration of this last observation, which I think

222 CORNS AND BUNIONS. tains (perhaps no more than a single drop) to escape. Thus, not only are the present symptoms relieved, but the corn is effectually destroyed, both the thickened cuticle and the bursa under it; and it is very easy, by means of the expedients which I have just recommended, to prevent it from being regenerated. The treatment of soft corns is to be conducted on the same principle as that of hard ones, some modification of the treatment, however, being required, on account of their peculiar texture and situation. The thickened cuticle may be removed by the application of the strong acetic acid, or strong nitric acid, applied so as to penetrate into its substance, but not to the parts beneath. The effect of this is to destroy the texture of the corn. It becomes dry and shrivelled. In the course of a few days it begins to exfoliate, and may then be readily peeled off. If an abscess forms in the bursa of a soft corn, it should be treated in the same manner as that in the bursa of a hard one. In some cases, even though there be no abscess underneath, a soft corn becomes exquisitely sen- sitive, so that the patient cannot bear it to be touched; and he is made as lame as if he suffered from the gout or any other painful malady. Such a case fell lately under my observation, which I mention, not because it was peculiar, but because the sufferings of the patient were unusually severe. There was a broad soft corn on the side of one toe, where it came in contact with the side of the adjoining toe, and not in the angle between them. The patient could scarcely walk, even with

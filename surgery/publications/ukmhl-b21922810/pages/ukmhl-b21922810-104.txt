DEATH FROM DROWNING 88 admission of air, of course it must occasion suffo- cation ; but there is no manifest reason why the admission of a small quantity of water should be very injurious. That the admission of water into the lungs is prevented by a spasm of the muscles of the glottis cannot, however, be doubted, since we are unable to account for the exclusion of it in any other manner; and a multitude of circumstances prove that these muscles form a sphincter to the windpipe, as perfect in its functions as any sphincter in the body. I have said that in a drowned animal there is always a deep expiration by which the air is almost completely expelled from the lungs. Mr. Coleman examined the lungs of a cat which had been drowned, by placing a ligature on the trachea, removing the lungs from the thorax, and then making an artificial opening below the liga- ture, all this being done under water. The air which escaped when the opening was made amounted only to half a drachm, yet the same lungs, when inflated, required two ounces of air for their complete distension. Were it possible for a man, having made a deep inspiration previously to his immersion in water, by means of a powerful effort, to restrain the action of the abdominal muscles, on which the forcible expulsion of air depends, we must conclude that life would be less speedily extinguished. I may here refer you to some ob- servations on this subject which I made in my lecture on the effects of strangulation, and which it is unnecessary for me to repeat.

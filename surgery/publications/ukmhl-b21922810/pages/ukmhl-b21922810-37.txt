THE MEDICAL PROFESSION. 21 c 3 turers, who pretend to practice the art, without having learned the science, of medicine. When the optician, in constructing an optical instrument, arranges his lenses and reflectors in a new order, his knowledge of the principles of optics enables him to predict the effect which will be produced, so that, except as to some minor circumstances, he can be scarcely said to be making an experiment. But there is no reason to believe that in the study of those varied and complicated phenomena, which are the subject of physiology and pathology, we shall ever arrive at that point which has been long since attained in optics, and some other branches of natural philosophy; and at all events, we are far distant from it at the present moment. Few greater benefits have been conferred on mankind than that, for which we are indebted to Ambrose Pareyâ€”the application of a ligature to a bleeding artery: but no knowledge which he possessed would have enabled him to say more than that it would be probably successful; and it was left for after-ages to demonstrate the principle on which it acts, and to explain the cir- cumstances which may cause its failure. John Hunter, as you will hereafter learn, was led by his knowledge of the animal economy to propose a new method of treating aneurism; and it is impos- sible to estimate the number of lives which have been preserved by this discovery; yet it was but an experiment, of which even his philosophic mind could not, with certainty, predict the result. It must, however, be admitted that science pointed out the road to these inventions. But this cannot

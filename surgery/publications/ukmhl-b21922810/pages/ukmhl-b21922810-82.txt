66 EFFECTS OF STRANGULATION. Here another question arises, of no small prac- tical importance:â€”For what length of time does the heart continue to act, so as to circulate the blood, after respiration has ceased ? 1st. This will depend on the age of the animal. The condition of the child before birth seems to bear a good deal of resemblance to that of a reptile ; and that of a newly-born infant partakes somewhat of the same character, so that the circulation will in him continue for a longer time after the suspension of breathing than in the adult. This fact is well known to practitioners in midwifery, and it ex- plains the great success with which they have recourse to the artificial inflation of the lungs in still-born children. 2. Something will depend, also, on the quantity of air retained in the lungs. It is remarkable, that in hanged animals, under ordinary circumstances, there is always a forcible expulsion of air from the lungs, in consequence of which they are found to be almost empty after death. This fact is wrell established by the experiments of the late Mr.Cole- man. In a dog, whose lungs, when fully dis- tended, would contain forty-three drachms, he found, after strangulation, that not more than one drachm was contained in the air-cells and bronchi. Under ordinary circumstances, according to my observations, it rarely happens that the heart con- tinues to contract so as to maintain the circulation for more than four minutes after the trachea is completely obstructed. In weak and exhausted animals the period appears to be shorter than in those that are strong and vigorous.

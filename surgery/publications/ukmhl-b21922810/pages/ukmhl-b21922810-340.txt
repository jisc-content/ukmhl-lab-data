324 MORTIFICATION. palm of the hand; the dogâ€™s tooth penetrates into it, and it would be a very serious thing to cut out tendons, nerves, and every thing else down to the metacarpal bones ; or it may be that after the excision you find on examination that the tooth has penetrated further than you had supposed, and where you cannot very easily follow it with the knife. On these and similar occasions, you can do nothing better than trust to the application of caustics. Mr. Youatt, the veterinary surgeon, who has had great dealings with rabid dogs, tells me that when he has been bitten he has always applied the nitrate of silver, and he is alive and well now ; so that in his case, this kind of caustic has done all that has been required. But then he applies it at the very instant when he is bitten; whereas very few of your patients have the nitrate of silver in their pocket, or could apply it if they had. The best caustic, I apprehend, for you to use on these occasions is the caustic potash ; and for this reason : that it dissolves the parts with which it comes in contact, and that afterwards the dissolved caustic penetrates still further beyond the part to which it has been actually applied. If the tooth penetrate to the cellular membrane, by the time that you are consulted some of the saliva may have reached the cells beyond, and if you apply the nitrate of silver, or the nitric acid, these will coagulate the fluids and harden the solids, while the caustic potash becoming diffused will follow the course of the saliva. A convenient way of applying the caustic on these and on some other occasions is this: melt it in a silver or

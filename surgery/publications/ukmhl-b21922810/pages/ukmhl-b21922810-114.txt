The second period to which I have alluded is that during which the patient lies in a state of stupor, in consequence of the injurious effects produced by the transmission of the dark- coloured blood to the brain ; and here, when natural respiration begins to fail, there is no doubt that artificial respiration may be had recourse to with advantage. But I need not occupy your time by any further observations on the subject. It is enough for me to refer you to the observations which I made in mv last lecture. â€¢/ In patients who are recovering from the effects of drowning, even more than in those who have been strangled, it must be of importance to supply the waste of animal heat by placing them in a warm temperature. The warm bath forms a simple and convenient method of attaining this object, and from the accounts which I have received from those who are more practically conversant with the effects of drowning in the human subject than I am, I can entertain no doubt that it produces another good effect by promoting the natural efforts to inspire.

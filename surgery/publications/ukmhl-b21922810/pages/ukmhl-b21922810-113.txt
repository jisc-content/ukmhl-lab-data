DEATH FROM DROWNING. 97 motionless, insensible, with dilated pupils, and labo- rious breathing. In the majority of instances, after a certain time has elapsed, there take place spas- modic contractions of the voluntary muscles, and these are the forerunners of complete resuscitation. But in other instances the difficulty of respiration continues; it is performed at longer, and then at still longer intervals, until at last it altogether ceases. In fact the phenomena are similar to those which occur after strangulation, with only this difference (which is, however, one of no small im- portance) that there is a greater degree of cold- ness of the body in consequence of it having been immersed in a cold medium. Treatment of drowned Persons. With respect to the recovery of persons who have been rescued from the water, when on the point of being drowned, I have little to offer in addition to what I have already stated, when I called your attention to the consequences and treatment of strangulation. As the mode of death is the same, so there must be a great similarity of treatment. There are two periods at which artificial respiration may possibly be useful. The first is that short interval of time between the cessation of the natural efforts to respire, and the cessation of the heartâ€™s action. If, however, I may venture to apply to the human subject the observations which I have made in experiments on smaller animals, short as that interval is in those that are strangled, it is still shorter in those that are drowned; and it is only in a very limited number H

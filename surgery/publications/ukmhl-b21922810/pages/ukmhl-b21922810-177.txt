Pressure on a venous trunk in the abdomen may produce the same effects, as may be often observed in a woman during pregnancy. When she has been brought to bed, and the pressure of the uterus is removed, the varicose veins in a great measure disappear. When she becomes pregnant again, the varicose veins recur; she brings forth another child, and they in a great measure subside, but not so com- pletely as before. Every time she is pregnant the varicose disease of the veins becomes aggravated, till at last it exists to a great extent in both legs. There are undoubtedly some cases in which we may trace varicose veins of the lower extremity to pressure or obliteration of the venous trunks; but in the majority of cases we cannot trace the disease to these sources. It appears to be the result of a mere weakness in the coats of the veins, rendering them incapable of supporting the weight of the column of blood between them and the heart. You will understand, then, why, when the coats of the veins are weak, persons of particular habits, or of a particular physical construction, are more liable to varicose veins of the legs than others. One who is always upon his legs, always standing or walking, is much more liable to have varicose veins of the legs than another who leads a more sedentary life, because there is here a column of blood almost always pressing on the veins below. Sir Everard Home has observed, that in the army M

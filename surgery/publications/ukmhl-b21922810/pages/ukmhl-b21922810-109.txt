Thus we hear of earthquakes in which the commotion of the earth is said to have continued during the space of eight or ten minutes, although in all probability they lasted for no longer time than thirty seconds ; and in the same manner we may account for the mistakes to which I have just alluded. When the infidel sultan of Egypt refused to believe that Mohammed could have ascended into the seven heavens, and held one thousand and one conferences with the Deity in the brief space of a few minutes, the Mussul- man divine, who was consulted on the occasion, endeavoured to bring his majesty to a more strict faith, by demonstrating that a short space of time was converted into a long one when a great num- ber of important events were crowded into it.

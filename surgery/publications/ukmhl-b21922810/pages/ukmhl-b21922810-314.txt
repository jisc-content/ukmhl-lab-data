MORTIFICATION. 298 in which inflammation of cellular membrane has already begun to terminate in gangrene, or threatens to do so, whether the inflammation be phlegmonous or erysipelatous, or that peculiar variety of inflammation which produces carbuncle. The effect of scarifications in preventing the further progress of mortification of the skin in all these cases is very remarkable; but, under certain circumstances, they produce a still greater benefit to the patient. ^Whenever putrid matter is pent up round a slough of the cellular membrane, the system is poisoned by it. The sulphuretted and carburetted hydrogen gas evolved during the decomposition of dead animal matter, seem to pass, in part at least, into the circulation, producing the most dangerous symptoms. The incisions which relieve the tension of the skin allow these noxious gases to escape, and the relief which this affords to the patient is very remarkable. I might, if it were necessary, enumerate a great number of cases in illustration of what I have just observed. One, however, will be sufficient; and this I am tempted to relate, because the case is in itself of great interest, and also because a particular instance may serve to impress the rule more on your minds than a mere general observation. I was called, some few years since, to see a gentleman, who appeared to be actually on the point of death. His extremi- ties were cold; his pulse barely perceptible. It was doubtful whether he was sensible or not. He made, on being roused, several imperfect attempts to speak, but could say nothing intelligible. Below the right hypochondrium there was a considerable

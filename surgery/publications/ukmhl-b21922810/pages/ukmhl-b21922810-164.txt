148 SERO-CYSTIC TUMORS These peculiar appearances, of course, have been destroyed by the immersion in alcohol. Having explained to you these facts in detail, with a view to impress the subject more com- pletely on your minds, I shall endeavour to trace, in a few words, the pathological history which they seem to establish, and which, not only as a matter of science, but in a practical point of view, it is important for you to understand. It appears, then, to be as follows :â€” First: A greater or less number of mem- branous cysts are generated in the breast, con- taining serum. The latter is at first of a light yellow colour, and transparent, but afterwards becomes of a darker colour, and opaque. There is reason to believe that these cysts are formed by a dilatation of portions of some of the lactiferous tubes. Secondly : Morbid growths or excrescences are generated from the inner surface of one or more of these cysts, projecting into their cavities. These excrescences seem to consist of albumen or fibrine, which, after some time (if not imme- diately), becomes organized. They are covered by a thin delicate membrane, which is reflected over them from the inner surface of the cyst; but whether they are originally formed between two layers of the membrane of the cyst, or whether the}^ are at first mere deposits of fibrine or albumen on the inner surface of the cyst, a thin membrane being formed on their surface afterwards, remains to be determined by future observations. Thirdly: There is some reason for believing

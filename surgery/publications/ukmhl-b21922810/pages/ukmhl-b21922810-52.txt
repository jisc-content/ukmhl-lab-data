THE DUTIES AND CONDUCT OF 36 that my observations should be restricted, and without taking on myself those duties which more properly belong to others. The first effect usually produced on the mind of a medical student, is that of being bewildered by the number and variety of subjects to which his attention is directed. In one class-room he is in- structed in chemistry; in another, in the materia medica. In one place, the structure of the human body is unravelled before him ; and in another, he contemplates the interminable varieties of disease, and the methods which are adopted for their cure. He sees none of the relations by which these different investigations are combined together, so as to form one science. He has the opportunity of learning a great number of facts, but for the most part they are insulated, and independent of each other; he can reduce them to no order, and the want of a proper arrangement and classification makes the recollection of them difficult and uncer- tain. But this is not peculiar to medical students. The same difficulty occurs to every one, who enters for the first time on an extensive field of research ; and they must indeed be very indolent, and very unfit for the business of life, who suffer themselves to be disheartened by it. Have patience for a while ; keep your attention fixed on the matters which are brought before you, and after every lesson that you have received, or at the close of every day, endeavour to recollect what you have seen and heard, and in the course of a short time there will be an end of the confusion ; the mist which there was before you will have passed away;

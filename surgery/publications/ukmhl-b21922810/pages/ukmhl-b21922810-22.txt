THE STUDIES REQUIRED FOR 6 patible with sufficient physical repose and mental relaxation. But it is not in this way that great things are to be accomplished, either in our profes- sion, or in any other. Habits of attention which are once lost are not easily regained; and no durable impressions are made upon a mind which is exercised beyond its powers. The slow but persevering tortoise reached the goal before the hare, who was over-confident of the speed which she could exercise if she were required to do so; and this fable, which we were taught in the nursery, conveys a moral lesson which the philosopher need not be ashamed to learn. The studies which will occupy the principal part of your time are those of anatomy, and of the hospital practice; and you cannot doubt as to which of these has the claim of precedency. I will not say that a student who attends the wards of the hospital in the beginning of his education, may not thence obtain some sort of useful practical knowledge ; but it is plain that he can profit little by it compared with one whose mind has been prepared by a previous diligent attendance on the anatomical lectures and dissecting-room. The attendance on anatomical lectures is necessary for your initiation into the study of anatomy. They give you a general view of what you have to learn, and are, at the same time, the source whence you will derive your principal instructions in physio- logy. For anatomy and physiology are one science, and to teach them separately is about as absurd as it would be to divide astronomy into two sciences, the one teaching the figure and size

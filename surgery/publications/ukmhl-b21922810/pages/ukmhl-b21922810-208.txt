SCIRRHOUS TUMORS OF THE BREAST 192 LECTURE X. ON THE CASES OF SCIRRHOUS TUMORS OF THE BREAST WHICH REQUIRE AN OPERATION. If a scirrhous tumor of the female breast be left to take its own course it gradually increases in extent; it contaminates the neighbouring tex- tures ; it finally ulcerates, and in the greater number of cases the patientâ€™s life is terminated in three or four years from the commencement of the disease. Not only is life terminated thus early, but death is preceded by a most painful state of the ulcer. It is disposed to bleed and to slough, and the patient is rendered miserable. There is not a much worse way of going out of the world than that of being destroyed by this disease. Looking at these facts alone, you would say that there is no doubt that the proper thing to do is to remove the tumor by an operation. But then there is another order of facts to be taken into account. We find that in the larger proportion of cases in which the operation is performed, the patient is not alive two or three years afterwards ; and in a great many cases, instead of the operation stopping the disease, it actually seems to hasten its progress. We find, besides, that the operation in itself is not in all cases free from danger.

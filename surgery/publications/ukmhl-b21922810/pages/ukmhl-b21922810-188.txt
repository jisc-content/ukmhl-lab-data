But some persons cannot well apply a bandage for themselves, and for them you may prescribe a laced stocking, which is in many respects very convenient. Those who are awkward in applying a bandage may manage the laced stocking very well for themselves. Laced stockings are made of various materials. The Chinese manufacture a calico called nanquin, which is a very good material for the purpose. Some laced stockings are now made partly of Indian rubber cloth, so that they are elastic. An ingenious artist in Jermyn-street makes a laced stocking of spiral wire, like the springs of braces, but of very fine texture, included between two folds of leather or something else. Whether you use spiral wire, or caoutchouc, it is not necessary that the whole of the stocking should be made of the elastic substance ; elasticity being required only in a part of the circumference. In most cases I find the caoutchouc cloth to be the best of these elastic materials. Patients complain of the elastic wire cloth being very hot; moreover it makes more pressure than is required, and the spiral wires not unfrequently break and prick the legs. In consequence of these objections, although this kind of bandage is very useful on many other occasions, I do not much recommend it in cases of varicose veins. With respect to the caoutchouc cloth, I ought not to omit this observation : although it is very useful where it forms only a portion of the circumference of a laced stocking,

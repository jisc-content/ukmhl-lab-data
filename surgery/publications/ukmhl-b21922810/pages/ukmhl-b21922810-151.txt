By means of the tourniquet the pressure may be easily regulated, and increased or diminished as the patient can bear it.

I do not say, however, that this method always succeeds. 1 had tried it in the case of the little boy whose case I have already mentioned, (on whose leg I afterwards used the seton,) and without advan- tage.

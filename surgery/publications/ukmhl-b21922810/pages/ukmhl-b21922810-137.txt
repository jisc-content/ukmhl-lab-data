UNUNITED FRACTURES. 121 upwards to some distance above the ankle. The fracture, then, in this case corresponded to that of the neck of the femur within the capsule; and when I killed the animal some time afterwards, there had been no attempt at union. The broken ends of the bone fitted each other so exactly that there was scarcely any motion between them. The synovial membrane was scarcely torn. The liga- ments were not torn. There had been no defect of nutrition, for the cancellous structure had become harder than natural, in consequence, as it seemed, of ossification of the medullary membrane ; but the fractured bones were as distinct from each other as if the fracture had been recent. Fracture of the neck of the femur unites ulti- mately by a ligamentous substance ; at least it does so in many instances. The ligament is sufficient to bind the bones a little together, but it makes a very different bond of union from that which would be formed by actual bone: and even this im- perfect union is the result of a very slow process ; not being completed for some months. It is not merely the neck of the femur in the human subject that does not unite, in consequence of its particular structure; at least something like this may be observed with respect to the bones of the cranium. A fissure of the cranium takes much longer to unite than a fracture of the arm. I first noticed this in examining the body of a person who died in St. Georgeâ€™s Hospital, six months after an injury of the head. I had expected to find the fissure quite united, but it proved, on dissec- tion, there was no union at all. In the Hunterian

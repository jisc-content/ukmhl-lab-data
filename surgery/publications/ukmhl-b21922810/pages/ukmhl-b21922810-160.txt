144 SERO-CYSTIC TUMORS Mr. Keate repeated the puncture with a needle, giving exit to a large quantity of yellow serum. The tumor, in consequence, was much reduced in size, but it soon enlarged again, so as to exceed its former dimensions. On the 21st of last De- cember, Mr. Keate made an incision into it, and the cyst was now so capacious that not less than half a pint of serum was evacuated by the wound. The serum now was tinged with blood, and a good deal of haemorrhage followed the incision. In the course of a few days a large dark-coloured fungus was seen projecting through the wound. Under these circumstances, on the second of the present month, (February 1840,) Mr. Keate amputated the breast, and you may here see the morbid appearances which it presents. The tumor consists of a large membranous cyst, which might have been capable of containing twelve ounces of fluid, if the greater part of its cavity had not been occupied by a great number of excrescences attached to its inner surface. These excrescences vary in size, the smallest being not bigger than a pea, while one of them is of the size of a small orange. They are covered by a thin membrane, which appears to be continuous with, and a reflection of, the inner layer of the cyst. When cut into, these excrescences present the appearance of a considerable variety of structure. Some of them may be compared to recently coagu- lated albumen not yet organized ; others, to imper- fectly organized flbrine ; some of them have an apparent resemblance to fatty tumors, although I do not find that they actually contain any oily

MORTIFICATION. 305 strangulated hernia on such a patient, even in half an hour, you may find the intestine dead. But if (as generally happens) the degree of constriction be less in consequence of the opening being of larger size, or the protruded intestine being smaller in quantity, then the venous circulation is ob- structed more than the arterial; there is no mortification immediately ; there is venous con- gestion followed by inflammation, which may end in mortification in the course of twro or three days, or, perhaps, not until after the lapse of a longer period. A man has a phimosis. He pulls back the praepuce, and the orifice becomes a stricture behind the corona glandis. There is venous con- gestion ; the gland is swollen, assumes a purple colour, then becomes inflamed, and the inflam- mation is followed by mortification. Again, a pa- tient has internal piles ; they protrude at the anus ; the sphincter muscle acts spasmodically upon them ; they cannot be pushed back through the sphincter ; the return of venous blood is prevented ; they swell, inflame, and, in the course of a few days, they mortify. By and by the slough drops off, and the disease is cured. You will now understand the principle which ought to be kept in view, when we use ligatures in surgical operations. You treat internal piles by the application of a ligature. If you draw the % ligature only moderately tight you do not kill them at once; they swell; they inflame; they may die at last, but by a painful and tedious process. If, however, the ligature be drawn as tight as possible, it stops the flow of the arterial x

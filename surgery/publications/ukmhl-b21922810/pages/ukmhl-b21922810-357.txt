341 MORTIFICATION. patient had fixed the day for leaving my care, there appeared, on the margin of the cicatrix, where there had been nothing before, a tubercle, which seemed to be precisely similar to what the other tumor had been in its origin. I destroyed this tubercle with caustic, and the sore, thus made, healed. A second and a third appeared, which were, also, destroyed in the same manner. No others have since shown themselves ; and I cannot but entertain some hopes that the disease is really eradicated.* I must not recommend you to use the chloride of zinc, without giving you this caution respecting it: never apply it, except where there is an ulcer- ated surface. If you apply it to the skin, you must first put on a blister, to remove the cutis, as, otherwise, it will scarcely act at all. But, even when the cuticle has been removed, it will not act for the first tw^enty-four hours ; and it will then begin to produce intolerable pain, which will con- tinue for four or five days. When the tumor is covered with skin, you must use the caustic potash or nitric acid first; and when the superficial slough has come away, if the further use of caustic is indicated, the chloride of zinc may be had recourse to. * Some years have now elapsed, and there has been no recur - rence of the disease.

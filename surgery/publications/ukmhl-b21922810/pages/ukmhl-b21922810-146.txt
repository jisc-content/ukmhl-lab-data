130 UNUNITED FRACTURES. of eminence communicated to the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society an account of a case in which he believed that he had performed this operation successfully. But I have since been informed, on what I believe to be indubitable authority, that he mistook the thickening of the soft parts which followed the operation for bony union, and that the event proved that there was no bony union whatever. I believe that it is now acknowledged that the success of this operation is at any rate very problematical; and as it cannot but be attended with some degree of hazard, I do not suppose that any modern surgeon, having a moderate share of prudence, would undertake it. Sir Everard Home used to mention in his lectures the case of a man with ununited fracture of the humerus, who was under the care of Mr. Hunter. There was an artificial joint, and Mr. Hunter having made an incision into it, intro- duced a spatula, scraping and irritating the lining membrane and the bone. This induced consider- able inflammation, which ended in anchylosis, and thus the patient was cured. I am not aware that this exact operation has been performed in any other case. Dr. Physick, of Philadelphia, however, has proposed what seems to be an improvement in it. He saw that the only object of Mr. Hunters operation was to induce inflammation, and that this object might be attained equally, and with more safety to the patient, by passing a seton through the artificial joint. This method must certainly be preferable to that of Mr. Hunter, as, when suppuration has taken place,

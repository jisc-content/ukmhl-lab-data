MORTIFICATION. 386 of it than you can find in books I shall not dwell upon it. Mortification of the Extremities from unknown Causes. In one of the earlier volumes of the Annual Register you will find a very curious account of a whole family becoming affected with mortification of the extremities, though it is not stated that they had been living on any deleterious articles of food. The account is given by a physician in Suffolk of a family in that county, and nothing is mentioned which throws light upon the cause of the mys- terious disease. The father, mother, and five children, if I remember rightly, were all affected. The lower extremities mortified in all except the father, in whom the fingers only mortified. Mr. Solly, in the two last volumes of the Medico- chirurgical Transactions, has given the history of a child, in whom one extremity after another, without any evident reason, mortified. The disease went on for twelve months, before it terminated fatally. The limbs had all mortified, and sloughs had separated; a sort of natural amputation having taken place. The child died, and the body was examined after death, but the examination threw little light on the pathology ; and the cause of the disease is still mysterious. In practice you will every now and then find other forms of mortification, which it is impossible to notice in lectures.

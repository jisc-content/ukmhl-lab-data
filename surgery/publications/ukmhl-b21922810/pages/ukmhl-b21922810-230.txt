CORNS AND BUNIONS. 214 projecting points, chiefly where the joints are situated, are pinched and tormented either by the neighbouring toes or by the leather of the shoe, and thus it is that corns of the feet are generated. In order that you should understand the precise situations in which corns are most likely to take place, you must consider more particularly the effects which the pressure of the shoe produces on the toes. The little toe is pushed from its parallel position, so that it is in fact underneath the fourth or adjoining toe, and corns are generated on its outer surface over the prominences of its joints. A corn is also frequently met with in the angle between the little toe and the next toe, where the first phalanx of the former is pressed against the head of the metatarsal bone supporting the latter. Sometimes the consequence of wearing a very narrow shoe is, that one of the toes (and it is generally the second or fore-toe) is pushed up- wards, so that it lies over the two adjoining toes, that is, over the great toe and the third toe, the extremities of which come in contact underneath; then the leather of the shoe being drawn tight over the upper surface of the second or displaced toe, corns are produced over one or more of its articulations. At other times one of the toes (and in this case also it is generally the second toe) is displaced in another way. The extremity of it is pushed downwards, so that it lies beneath the extremities of the two adjoining toes, which come in contact over it. But this change cannot take place while the three phalanges of the displaced toe remain in a line with each other. â€™The first

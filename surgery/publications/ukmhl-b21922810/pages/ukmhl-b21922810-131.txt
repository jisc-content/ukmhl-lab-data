From the quantity of motion between the bones, it is plain that there is no bony union, but I conclude that there is union by something like ligament. The question then is, In what manner are we to proceed, so as to make the broken bones unite, and give this man ultimately an useful limb ? And in order to answer this question we must consider, 1st, In what manner do fractures unite under ordinary circumstances ? 2d, What are the circumstances under which fractures do not unite ? 3d, What are the various means that may be employed for the purpose of procuring the union of a fracture which has not united at the proper period ? Lastly, Which of these various means it will be best to adopt in this instance ? Union of Fractures under ordinary Circumstances. The opinion held formerly respecting the union of a fracture—and this was Mr. Hunters doc- trine—was, that when a bone was broken, the blood became extravasated; that lymph was thrown out from inflammation ; that the two broken ends of the bone became united by the coagulum of extravasated blood, and by the effused lymph; that this uniting substance became organized, blood-vessels being formed in it; and that, by and by, the vessels deposited bony matter. This is a very simple explanation of the phenomena which occur after a bone is broken; but it is too

MORTIFICATION. 302 arrested by blood-letting, or by what are com- monly called antiphlogistic remedies. It occurs in persons of a debilitated habit, and requires almost from the beginning an opposite mode of treatment. Such nourishment should be admi- nistered as the stomach will bear, with wine or porter; and where the tongue is clear and moist the decoction of cinchona may be given with advantage. Let us now suppose that mortification has taken place to a certain extent; that the progress of it is arrested; and that the system survives the shock ;â€”What further local treatment is required ? Indeed, I have little faith in any. The separa- tion of the slough is a natural process. It is usual to employ stimulating, or, as they are called, digestive ointments : solution of chloride of soda ; stale beer poultice ; and other applications of the same kind. But my own experience would lead me to believe that the process of separation will go on just as fast with the simplest treatment, such as that of bread-and-water poultice, or a linseed poultice, or wet lint with a piece of oiled silk over it. The constitutional treatment, at any rate, is of much more importance than any topical applications. Tonics may at this period be given with advantage; but the discreet administration of wine and a nourishing diet is of more import- ance still. Of course no general rule can be laid down. You must study the existing symptoms, and act accordingly.

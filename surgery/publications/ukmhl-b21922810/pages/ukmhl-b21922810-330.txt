MORTIFICATION. 314 cellular membrane may be destroyed, while the skin is not, you must watch the patient; and if there be swelling and inflammation you should divide the skin, and save it from perishing as far as you can, though you cannot save it entirely. But in other cases the mortification is not con- fined to the part actually injured, but may extend to the greater part of the limb. These are the cases to which the name of traumatic gangrene more commonly is applied. A severe injury is inflicted on the leg, and a large portion of it mor- tifies. It would appear that the mode in which traumatic gangrene is produced varies in different cases. Mr. Guthrie, for example, describes a case in which mortification of the leg took place as high up as the knee, in consequence of a blow on the back of the leg. The limb was amputated; and when he came to dissect the parts, it was found that the blow had lacerated the lining membrane of the popliteal artery, in consequence of which there had been effusion of lymph into the cavity of that vessel, stopping it up. That alone might not have produced mortification, but the anterior and pos- terior tibial arteries were torn through also; and the result of this double injury was, that the limb, not getting a proper supply of blood, perished. In this case the pressure of extravasated blood might have contributed, in some degree, to pro- duce the mortification. But local extravasation of blood, if it exist to a very great extent, is, of itself, sufficient to produce this effect. When I was house- surgeon, a man was brought into this hospital, with some kind of tumor above the groin, but no

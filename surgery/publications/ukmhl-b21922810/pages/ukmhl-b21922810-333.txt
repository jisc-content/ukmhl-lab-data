317 MORTIFICATION. mortification being stopped, and for the formation of a distinct line of separation, before you proceed to an operation. But it must have been palpable to every body who took the pains to consider the subject, that this rule would not apply to all cases of mortification. For example, a man has a stran- gulated hernia; when you open the sac you find the omentum strangulated, a part of it dead, and the mortification still extending. You would not hesitate in a case like this to cut off the dead and dying omentum. If piles were undergoing the process of mortification from being strangulated by the sphincter muscle, you would not hesitate to cut them off. You may conceive many other cases, in which the cause of mortification is local, and to which the general rule which I have just mentioned does not apply. Baron Larrey has the credit of having pointed out more distinctly than had been done before, that, where there is mortifi- cation from local injury, 3â€™ou may venture to amputate, though the mortification is still spread- ing. But I apprehend that the operation must be had recourse to at once, and that the case admits of no delay. If, in consequence of mechanical injury to a limb, mortification has begun, but has not yet produced any severe shock on the system, there you may amputate. But where the mortification has been going on for some days, so that the sys- tem has begun to be influenced by it, the pulse getting weak, perhaps intermitting, and with great prostration of strength ; in such a case you must not venture to amputate. Under such circum- stances, it is probable that the system is not in a

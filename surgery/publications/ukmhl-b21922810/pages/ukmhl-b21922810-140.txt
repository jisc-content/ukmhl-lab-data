UNUNITED FRACTURES. 124 kind are on record, where the fact had been verified by dissection ; and I have seen instances where we had reason to believe, on examining the living person, that the same thing had happened. It is usually supposed that a great deal depends upon the limb not being kept perfectly quiet; and that if there be not a good apparatus employed, such as will fully answer this purpose, union may be prevented from taking place. I cannot say that this may not be a sufficient reason in the human subject, but it is not so in animals ; for in them I have tried, over and over again, to prevent union, by giving motion to the broken bone several times daily; but it really appeared, that for the most part the process of union went on more rapidly in animals whose limbs were thus exercised than in others ; and it was only in a single instance that, at the end of the time when bony union is generally completed, I found that there was no union, except by ligament. In most instances, I cannot doubt that the want of union is to be traced to a peculiar state of the constitution. A gentleman was growing fat, and not liking to do so, he placed himself on a very spare diet, though accustomed to good living previously.

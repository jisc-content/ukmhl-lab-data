VARICOSE VEINS AND 188 took a long time to heal; and where one cluster was cured, other clusters appeared. Alto- gether it was a very tedious process, and my own experience does not lead me to recommend it. Then I contrived another method. Though there is danger in cutting across large veins, or in tying them, there does not appear to be any danger which can be appreciated from the ligature of smaller veins. Piles are nothing originally but varicose veins. Now I have performed operations for internal piles, I cannot tell you how often, for there is nothing in the practice of surgery more common, and can testify that it is a very rare thing to have venous inflammation arising in consequence. We frequently cut across small veins in opera- tions, and they are divided by accident, but we scarcely ever find venous inflammation super- vening. Although there may be danger from operations on the vena saphena, we have no right to expect danger from operations on its smaller branches. My plan was as follows. Supposing that I intended to cure a particular cluster of veins, I used a sharp-pointed and very narrow bistoury, which cuts, not like a common bis- toury, on the concave, but on the convex edge. I punctured the skin with this instrument on one side of the varicose cluster; carried the blade under the skin, between it and the varicose veins, over to the other side; and having carefully per- formed this part of the operation, the skin remain- ing entire, except where the first puncture was made, I turned the edge of the instrument back- wards, and, drawing it out, cut across the varicose

MORTIFICATION. 288 yellow tinge is to be attributed. The patient looks as if he were jaundiced, but he is not so in reality, for there is no bile in the urine. When mortification of the cellular membrane has begun to take place, the constitution suffers in the manner which I have just described in speaking of morti- fication of the integuments. If the patient survives the shock, or lives for some time under it, the mortification of the cellular membrane is invariably followed by mortification of the skin over it to a greater or less extent. Allowing for the difference of function in the affected organs, the foregoing description will apply pretty nearly to all cases in which inflam- mation of the soft parts terminates in mortification. If there be mortification of the intestine, there is an effusion of dark-coloured serum into the abdo- minal cavity. Whenever the part which mortifies is situated internally, so that the putrid serum formed round the slough cannot escape, the con- stitution suffers much more than where it is situated externally, and especially an intermitting pulse and hic-cough are often added to the other symptoms. Probably these more aggravated symptoms are to be attributed to the exhalations from the pent up putrid matter being in part absorbed into the circulation. I shall mention some circumstances hereafter which seem to favour this opinion. It forms an interesting subject of inquiry, How is it that inflammation terminates in mortification ; or what is the pathological explanation of this phenomenon ? And this leads us to the question as

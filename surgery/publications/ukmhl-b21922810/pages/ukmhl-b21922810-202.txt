VARICOSE VEINS AND 186 stances. But I may observe further, that there appears to be no reason why, in ordinary cases of varicose veins, the obliteration of the saphena should do any good, and that there are better grounds for believing that it will do harm. I have already explained to you that pressure on large venous trunks causes an obstruction of the blood in passing through them, and that this is one common cause of varices. In very bad cases, however, of the disease, I can understand why the patient should derive benefit from the ligature of the principal vein. To explain this, I must first call your attention to the different condition of the parts where the veins are very much dilated, and where the disease has proceeded only to a limited extent. If the veins are but little dilated, or dilated only in particular places, the valves will still continue to answer the purpose for which they are designed. If the vena saphena be not at all dilated, while the smaller veins of the leg are dilated, the valves of the vena saphena act perfectly, and take off the weight of the column of blood pressing on the veins below; but if the vena saphena be itself considerably dilated, its valves are of course rendered inefficient. Now observe the result of this. I had a patient in whom there was an unusually large cluster of varicose veins on the inside of the leg, while the vena saphena major was of enormous diameter, so that the valves were evidently good for nothing. If I put on a bandage, and squeezed the blood out of the veins below, and then put my thumb on the vena saphena above, so as to

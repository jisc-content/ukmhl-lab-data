264 TIC DOULOUREUX, OR FACIAL NEURALGIA. very unsatisfactory mode of proceeding it must be acknowledged, but you have no alternative. You may give your patient quinine, which is useful in many cases of nervous pain, even though it be neither intermitting nor periodical; or you may prescribe the carbonate of iron, which is supposed (and, perhaps, not altogether without reason,) to relieve many neuralgic affections also. Half a drachm of the carbonate of iron may be given three times daily, and the dose may be gradually increased to a drachm. I never knew any good to arise from increasing the dose beyond this ; and I can easily conceive that much harm may arise from it being given in those enormous doses in which, as I am informed, it is administered by some practitioners. It is easy to conceive, that where thus exhibited, the colon may be actually clogged by it, just as in other cases it is found clogged by magnesia, or Ward’s paste, or cubebs pepper. Whenever you prescribe any of these insoluble substances, you should also prescribe an occasional purgative, with a view to prevent the accumulation of it in the bowel. I have been informed on good authority of the case of a person who died of inflammation of the bowels, the effect of large doses of cubebs pepper which had not been purged off; and it is easy to conceive, that without proper precautions, the exhibition of large doses of carbonate of iron might cause the • same mischief. If the quinine and carbonate of iron fail, it may then be worth while to try the effect of the sulphate or oxyde of zinc, the ammonio-sulphate

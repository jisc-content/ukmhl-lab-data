112 CYSTS CONTAINING WATERY FLUID, &C. had excited inflammation and suppuration. That under these circumstances adhesions were formed between the neighbouring parts, that the abscess burst into the colon, and that the cyst had after- wards been discharged through the ulcerated opening. The case has been fortunate in its result. But it must in candour be acknowledged that this good result has not been attained without considerable danger to life. There is nothing in what has occurred that would justify us in making it our object to induce suppuration in another case of the same kind; and if we compare what happened in this case, with what happened in the two cases which I attended formerly, we shall find good reason for wishing to avoid it. On any occasion when some cause of anxiety has arisen, which I would avoid in future, I always consider whether any thing in my own practice ought to have been different from what it was. Without such revision of our conduct we can never become really good surgeons. I suspect that in this instance I made an error in being over-anxious to draw off every portion of the fluid, and that in compressing the cyst for this purpose the canula of the trocar became a source of irritation, and laid the founda- tion of the inflammation which followed. I have seen the same thing happen in more than one case of ovarian dropsy, where the over-anxiety of the surgeon to empty the tumor completely has been followed by inflammation of the ovarian cyst, and placed the patients life in danger.

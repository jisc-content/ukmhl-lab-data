282 ADIPOSE TUMORS. chronic mammary tumor blended with each other. The entire mass probably weighed between two and three pounds. The patient recovered; and up to this time, that is, at the end of seven years, there has been no recurrence of the disease. It was the opinion of Sir Astley Cooper that a fatty tumor will sometimes take on the action of a malignant disease, and become a malignant tumor. Whether this opinion was founded on dissections I do not know, but it probably was so; at all events I have no doubt that he had seen cases in living persons (from which, great as the advantages arising from morbid anatomy are, the best part of pathology is to be learned,) which justified this opinion ; and in confirmation of it I may mention the following case. A farmer from a distant part of the country applied to me on account of what seemed to be a fatty tumor in the back. It was as big as your two fists put together, and had existed for a long time. There seemed to be no reason to doubt that it was a fatty tumor; yet it was a little firmer in its consistence than such tumors generally are. I removed the tumor by an operation, and, on making an incision into it after- wards, I found that it wTas composed of wdiat seemed to be fatty substance, somewhat more con- densed than usual ; but that, here and there, dispersed throughout the mass, there was another kind of morbid growth, apparently belonging to the class of medullary or fungoid disease. It is reasonable to suppose, that if this tumor had been allowed to remain, it wTould have ulcerated, and run the usual course of a malignant disease.

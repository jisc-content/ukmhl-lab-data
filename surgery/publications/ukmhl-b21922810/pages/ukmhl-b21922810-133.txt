UNUNITED FRACTURES. 117 i 3 and below the fracture ; the neighbouring muscles and tendons are closely attached to its surface ; and the fractured extremities of the bone lie, as it were loose, in a cavity in the centre, with a small quantity of vascular albumen, resembling a semi- transparent jelly. Here, then, is a kind of splint which nature contrives, and which is nearly completed within a week from the date of the accident. We call this new formation, the callus. This process goes on : the surrounding substance becomes thicker, and of still firmer consistence; and here is a drawing- showing the appearance which the parts exhibit at the end of ten days after the accident. In the course of a few days more the thin jelly, which lay in contact with the broken ends of the bone, has disappeared, and its place is supplied by a callus continuous with that which formed the original capsule. This drawing explains the appearance which the parts exhibit at this period ; and this we may consider as the termination of the first stage of the curative process. The broken ends of the bones now are completely imbedded in a mass of vascular organized substance, or callus, something between gristle and cartilage in consis- tence; and as yet there are no traces of bony matter in it. At this time, if you remove the adventitious substance, you find the broken ends of the bone retaining exactly their original figure, and presenting the same appearance, as immediately after the fracture took place. At the end of about three weeks, if you make a section of the callus, minute specks of earthy mat-

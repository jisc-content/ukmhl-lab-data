64 EFFECTS OF STRANGULATION. nevertheless; at first regular, frequent, and vigo- rous, then gradually becoming less so, until they cease altogether; and the motions of the heart, under these circumstances, without any blood in it, last as nearly as can be for the same time as those of the heart distended with blood after strangula- tion. But if the blood be not the stimulus, to what can we attribute the contractions of the heart, unless it be the influence of the nervous system ? And is not this a much more reasonable hypothesis than the other, more conformable to analogy, and offer- ing a better explanation of the phenomena which occur both in health and in disease ? The supply of scarlet blood is not less necessary to the produc- tion of nervous energy than it is to that of muscular irritability. The diaphragm is stimulated to con- tract in respiration, not by the air in the lungs, but by impressions which it receives through the phrenic nerves. So it is with the muscles which are concerned in the acts of coughing, sneezing, vomiting. In a case of extra-uterine conception, the uterus begins to contract at the expiration of the ordinary period of gestation, although there is no foetus to be expelled. Taking this view of the subject, we understand why the successive con- tractions of the different portions of the heart are as regular and as orderly as those of the muscles of respiration, or of the muscles of the limbs in walking. We have an easy solution of the various irregularities of the circulation produced by mental emotions, and by other causes ; and we also under- stand why the suspension of respiration must soon be followed by a suspension of the action of the

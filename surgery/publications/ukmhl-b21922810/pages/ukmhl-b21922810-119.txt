103 DEATH FROM LIGHTNING. H 4 of the voluntary muscles. In the evening, five hours after the experiment was made, he was still in the same condition, but on the following morn- ing he was found dead and stiff. It has been stated, on no less an authority than that of Mr. Hunter, that in a person killed by lightning there is an instantaneous and complete destruction of the vital principle in every part of the animal machine ; that the muscles are relaxed and incapable of contraction; that the limbs do not become stiffened as after ordinary death, and that the body immediately begins to undergo the changes which are the result of putrefaction. That lightning never produces such phenomena as these I am not prepared to assert; but, in the experiments which I have just described, such an instantaneous extinction of vitality certainly did not take place. It is manifest that the functions of the brain were those on which the electric shock exercised its principal influence, and that the suspension of those functions was the immediate cause of death. Now let us compare the results of these experi- ments with those of human beings who have been struck by lightning, and who have afterwards recovered. One person* (as we are informed) felt an im- pulse on one side of his head, and his sense of hearing was impaired afterwards. Another per- sonf felt as if stupihed, and forced to the ground he knew not how. A third individual^ is described * Philosophical Transactions, vol. xxxiv. t Ibid. J Struve on Suspended Animation.

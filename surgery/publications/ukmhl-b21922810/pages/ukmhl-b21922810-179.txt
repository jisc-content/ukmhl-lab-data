163 ULCERS OF THE LEGS. m 2 veins comes on rather suddenly. I have known cases in which the veins in both legs became varicose immediately after very hard walking. But, in general, the disease comes on slowly, and increases gradually. At first one or two veins are a little dilated, and you see the dark blood of a blue colour through the skin. Then other veins assume the same appearance; and by and by you find clusters of varicose veins in different parts of the leg. The skin is elevated by the clusters underneath; and being stretched and rendered thin, it allows the dark colour of the blood to be seen through it. The varices are most fre- quently situated about the inner ankle, and the inner side of the leg; but they may occur any where else; at the back or outside of the limb. Then, as the disease proceeds, it extends to the trunk of the vena saphena major* which becomes dilated all the way up to the groin. Sometimes the saphena major is as large as your finger, assuming a knotted appearance; the explanation of which is, that varicose veins are not only in- creased in diameter, but in length, and of course must then be made tortuous; and where the sa- phena vein is twisted, as it were, upon itself, it assumes the appearance which I have mentioned. The dilatation of it is perceptible when the patient stands erect; but when he lies down the varicose appearance vanishes, because then the vein becomes emptied of its blood. While these changes take place in the condition of the veins, the patient experiences more or less inconvenience. Sometimes he suffers from a sense

TIC DOULOUREUX, OR FACIAL NEURALGIA. 253 there may be pain in the breast, while the real disease is an hysterical state of the constitution generally. Tic douloureux, or facial neuralgia, belongs to this last class of pains. The pain which is felt is referred to some part or other of the face, or to the whole of one side of the face, and yet there is no disease there. You are not to suppose that the cause of the pain in this complaint is always the same; the fact is, the pain is but a symptom, and it may depend upon different causes; so that among those patients who are said to be affected with tic douloureux, the real nature of the disease varies very much in different cases. There may be half a dozen of persons with tic douloureux in the face, the symptoms in all of them being the same, or very nearly the same, and the real disease may be different in every one of them. The pain, as I have said, has the same character in all these cases, and it differs from the pain of most other nervous affections. You will observe that the branches of the fifth pair are all under particular anatomical circumstances; that they all proceed from that remarkable plexus which is bathed, as it were, in the blood of the cavernous sinus, and that the branches of it all run through bony structures ; the second and third branches especially being enveloped in bone to a great extent; and probably it is from one or other of these anatomical circum- stances, or from both of them combined, that the pain derives its peculiar character. The pain in all these cases, whatever may be the cause of it, generally comes on gradually. At

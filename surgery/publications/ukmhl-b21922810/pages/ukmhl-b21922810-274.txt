258 TIC DOULOUREUX, OR FACIAL NEURALGIA. west end of London,â€”in the midst of his career of prosperity became affected with the tic douloureux, and suffered from it in the most horrible manner. I never saw any individual under the same circum- stances whose sufferings were equal to his ; but I am led to mention his case at present, because, after having retired into the country, he died at last with symptoms of cerebral disease. There was a gentleman who had suffered from the tic douloureux in the face for a very long time. By and by the pain in the face ceased; but he was attacked with fits of epilepsy. Then there was a ptosis, or a dropping down of the upper eye- lid, on the side in which the tic douloureux had existed previously. At last, after a more than usually severe fit of epilepsy, he fell into a state of apoplexy, and died. Mr. Green, Mr. Freeman, and myself (by whom he had been attended) exa- mined the body. We found all the membranes of the brain bearing marks of chronic inflammation. The vessels connecting the dura mater to the bone were unusually large ; the tunica arachnoides was thickened, and, at the upper and posterior part of the left hemisphere of the cerebrum, it was adhering to the inner surface of the dura mater in a spot about an inch in diameter. The cerebrum generally was soft and vascular, exhibiting a red mottled appearance in many places. The softening of its substance was most distinct in the crura cerebri, the fornix, and adjacent parts. The nerves of the fifth pair were carefully examined, as far as they lay within the cranium, but they presented no morbid appearances.

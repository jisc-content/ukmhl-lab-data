WHICH REQUIRE AN OPERATION. 209 it is of importance in practice that you should not forget.

The whole of the skin had assumed the scirrhous structure, so that the tumor of the breast was scarcely to be distinguished under it. She had also some disease of the liver, and there was a discharge from the uterus. She died ; and on examining the breast, there was found a well-marked scirrhous tumor in it; but in the liver there was a tumor, having equally well-marked characters of fungus haematodes or medullary disease ; and in the uterus there was an excrescence of that kind which the late Dr. John Clarke described as the â€œ cauliflower excrescenceand which he regarded as an incur- able malignant disease of that organ. So that these three diseases, all malignant, and to which different names have been given by pathologists, were all associated in the same individual. You will see the appearances which they presented sufficiently well preserved in the preparations on the table. On other occasions you will find malignant dis- eases, to which different names are given, occuring in succession. When I was a young man, I went with Sir Everard Home, to assist him in a private operation in the case of a lady from the country, who had a tumor apparently in the abdominal muscles. Sir Everard removed the tumor; and when we came home, and examined it, we found that a portion of p

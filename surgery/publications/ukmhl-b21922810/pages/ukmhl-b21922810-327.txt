MORTIFICATION. 311 x 4 by other means,—by an air cushion with a hole in the centre, the tender part over the os sacrum being in the hole of the cushion. But in all cases where you use an expedient of this kind you should first apply a piece of common soap plaster, spread on calico, over the part, (or, what is still better, the amadou spread with soap plaster, which I have mentioned in a former lecture,) to support it. If you merely place the hole of the cushion under the os sacrum, the skin will bulge into the hole, and the patient will be as badly off as if there were no hole at all, or even worse. In cases where you can have recourse to it, Dr. Arnott’s hydro- static bed is very useful in preventing these ill consequences. When you lie on a mattrass, the pressure is thrown on all the prominent parts of the body, and there is very little elsewhere; but in using the water-bed the water rises to fill up the hollow places, and the pressure is not greater on the sacrum than it is on other parts. Un- doubtedly this bed is the best method which has yet been contrived for the equal diffusion of pres- sure ; the only objection to it is, that it is not applicable to all cases. In cases of compound fracture of the thigh or leg, for example, it would not give sufficient steadiness to the injured limb. But another plan may be adopted to prevent mortification from pressure; that is, to prevent the inflammation which precedes it. The thicker the cuticle the more it will protect the parts beneath; you may, if you attend to it in time, add to the thickness of the cuticle by stimulating the surface of the skin. Nurses know this very

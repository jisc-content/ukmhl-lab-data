EFFECTS OF STRANGULATION. 6/ f 2 If animals were hanged in the act of inspi- ration, having the lungs distended with air, we may presume that the period would be longer than what I have mentioned; and an experiment made by Mr. Coleman justifies this conclusion. Mr. Kite connected a bladder filled with air with a tube, and the tube with the trachea of a dog. He then kept the lungs of the dog forcibly dis- tended by pressure on the bladder. The animal showed no signs of uneasiness for eight minutes ; then symptoms of suffocation began to show them- selves ; nevertheless, at the end of twelve minutes the heart was still acting. It is of great consequence that we should bear in mind that the heart will maintain the circulation of the dark-coloured blood for only a very few minutes after the trachea is completely closed. I shall show you hereafter that where, under these circumstances, the circulation has once ceased it can never be restored. I know that what I have just stated, as to the period of time during which the heart may con- tinue to act after respiration has ceased, may appear to be in contradiction to what has been stated by some other physiologists. But observe, that I speak only of those orderly, regular, and vigorous contractions, by which, and by which only, the circulation of the blood can be maintained. There are other irregular and feebler contractions, which correspond to those of the panniculus carnosus in a newly-slaughtered bullock, which may continue for a much longer period, and which, when the heart has become quiescent within

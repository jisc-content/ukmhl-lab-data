If the leg be hanging down at the time of the plaster being applied, the veins are full of blood, and the plaster becomes loose as soon as the foot is raised. The plaster, if there be much discharge, should be changed daily; but as the discharge becomes less in quantity, it may be changed every other day, or once in three days, and in some cases even less frequently than this.

The ulcer may be above, and you may cover it with a bandage ; but if there be such veins, as I have mentioned, below, you must not, for obvious rea- sons, leave them uncovered.

DEATH FROM DROWNING. 94 have the power of remaining under water for a longer period than animals which are placed under different circumstances. There is reason to believe that this observation is applicable even to aquatic birds. Mr. Robert Boyle, in the fifth volume of the Philosophical Transactions, gives an account of some experiments made by himself, in which he found that the smaller birds were completely dead after submersion for a single minute, whereas a duck showed no signs of uneasiness for two minutes; then began to struggle, and continued to do so, and to emit bubbles of air from the mouth for four minutes, so that four minutes had elapsed before death had apparently taken place. With respect to cetaceous animals, it is difficult to procure any exact information as to the time during which they can remain in the water with- out coming to the surface to breathe; but we may reasonably conclude, that an animal which re- sembles fish so much in its form and mode of life, would be endowed with the faculty of diving in greater perfection than ordinary mammalia. There is a peculiar structure of the vascular system of these animals, which has been described by John Hunter, which has been overlooked by some of the most eminent comparative anatomists of a later period, and has not generally attracted so much attention as it seems to me to merit. John Hunter, in his observations on the structure and economy of whales, remarks, that “ the inter- “ costal arteries divide into a vast number of “ branches, which run in a serpentine course “ between the pleurae, ribs, and their muscles,

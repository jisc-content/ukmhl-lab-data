MORTIFICATION. 370 sofa; but this never answers; therefore send him to bed at once; if he strives against it for the first few days, he will be driven to bed at last, and will be worse off than if he had submitted in the first instance. Much indeed of the success of the treatment will depend on his being placed in the uniform warmth which a bed affords at the very commencement of the attack. Then, what local treatment is required besides ? It is common to apply poultices made of the grounds of stale beer, or of red wine and oatmeal, and some recommend a solution of chloride of soda. I was accustomed formerly to rub the legs and thighs wTith a stimu- lating liniment, but I soon left off this practice, finding that it did no good; and I believe now, that if it does any thing, it does harm. The toes mortify because they do not get a sufficient supply of blood. Rub the thigh and leg with a stimu- lating liniment, and it is the same thing, only less in degree, as blistering them; and what would be the consequence of applying blisters ? They would draw the blood to other parts. It is wanted in the foot and you draw it elsewhere. It is something like taking blood from the arm,â€”not indeed so mischievous ; a mistake less in degree, but the same in kind.

Nor have I any reason, from what I have seen, to believe that those other applications which I have mentioned used, as poultices and lotions, are of any service. Some few years ago, I was in consultation with

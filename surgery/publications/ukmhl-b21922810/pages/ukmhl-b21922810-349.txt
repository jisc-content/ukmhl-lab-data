333 MORTIFICATION. occupying a very large portion of the face, in the same manner, there being very little or no scar afterwards. There is another class of cases which may be very conveniently treated with caustic, and in general much better than with the knife—I mean those tumors which I have been in the habit of calling half-malignant, and which occur on the face chiefly of elderly people. A man has a soft tubercle upon the face, covered by a smooth skin. He may call it a wart, but it is quite a different thing. On cutting into it you find it consists of a brown solid substance, not very highly organ- ized. A tumor of this kind may remain on the face unaltered for years, and then, when the patient gets old, it may begin to ulcerate. The ulcer spreads, slowly but constantly, and if it be left alone it may destroy the whole of the cheek, the bones of the face, and ultimately the patient’s life; but it may take some years to run this course. So far these tumors in the face, and these ulcers, are to be considered as malignant. Never- theless they are not like fungus haematodes or cancer; and for this reason, that the disease is entirely local. It does not affect the lymphatic glands, nor do similar tumors appear in other parts of the body. I have generally been in the habit of destroying these tumors with caustic, and when they are of small size I prefer it to the knife, for the reasons I have formerly mentioned. If a patient applies to you with one of these tumors as large as a pea or a horse-bean, not ulcerated, but beginning to increase in size, you

122 UNUNITED FRACTURES. Museum, at the College of Surgeons, there is a specimen of extensive fracture of the skull indi- cating the same fact. The skull has been broken in several places. There is no displacement of the broken edges, yet there is no attempt at union. It is evident that the patient had lived a considerable time after the accident, the sharp edges of the fracture having been made smooth by absorption. You will observe that the bones of the skull have the dura mater lining them on the inside, while on the outside there is the periosteum, and over it the tendon of the occipo-frontalis muscle, without any intervening mass of loose cellular membrane. Whether it is to this, or to other cir- cumstances in the anatomical structure of the parts, that the want of union in fracture of the cranium is to be attributed, I cannot say; but there is no doubt as to the fact. The union which is completed in a few weeks after a fracture in other bones, in the skull may require several months, or even a longer period. However, I believe that union always takes place at last. It has been said that diseased bones, when broken, will not unite ; and I believe this may be the case, where there is an abscess in the bone, where there is necrosis, and in some other instances. I know, however, that the rule is not absolute; and that in a great many cases, where the bone is diseased, it will unite perfectly. I had a patient who had disease of the bones ; whether it arose from syphilis, or mercury, or a cachectic state of the con- stitution, I cannot say; however, some of the bones had nodes upon them, and were very much en-

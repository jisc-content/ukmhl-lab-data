337 MORTIFICATION. You must, however, apply it in these cases with great caution ; and for this reason : if you destroy at once a large portion of the pericranium, it is not improbable that a separation of the dura mater from the inside of the bone will be the consequence. A case of this kind, which I saw long ago, made a strong impression on my mind. A surgeon applied the caustic potash to the scalp, with a view to make an issue in a man’s head, who was labouring under a head-ache, and nothing else. When the slough had separated a piece of the occiput was exposed, as large as half-a-crown, or larger. The patient was soon seized with a set of strange symp- toms, and died. It was found that the dura mater had become detached from the inside of the bone, just opposite the part where the pericranium had been destroyed on the outside ; and it was clear that the sloughing of the dura mater was the cause of the man’s death. I mention this case to show that you must be cautious in the use of caustic when you apply it to the scalp ; but you may apply it there, nevertheless, if you proceed in a prudent manner. I had lately a very successful case of one of these half-malignant tumors of the scalp, which was much ulcerated, and had been going on for some years. I applied caustic to the different parts in succession, not making a fresh application until the slough made by the former one had come away. By proceeding in this manner the bone was not killed, except a very thin layer on the surface, and the patient was cured. You may, with proper precaution, apply caustics to parts situated internally, even to the inside of z

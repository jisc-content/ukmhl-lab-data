75 EFFECTS OF STRANGULATION. of natural respiration is that of inflating the lungs by a pair of bellows, or a syringe, or some similar contrivance. This may seem to be a very simple matter, but it is not quite so simple in reality. The air impelled into the lungs should be as much as is inhaled in ordinary respiration; but not more than this, for, independently of other objections, there would then be danger that the too forcible disten- sion of the air-cells would cause a portion of the air to enter the blood-vessels, thus occasioning almost instantaneous death. Again the inflation of the lungs should be performed at proper inter- vals, so as to resemble natural respiration as nearly as possible. The operator should have a watch with a second hand before him: when the pulse can be felt it may be counted by an assistant, and the lungs may be inflated accordingly, it being borne in mind that, under ordinary cir- cumstances, there are three inspirations for one pulsation of the heart and arteries. Various contrivances have been proposed for the purpose of inflating the lungs; the single and double bellows, elastic gum bottles, and syringes of different kinds. It has been recommended, that the tube of inflation should be introduced into the trachea, through the aperture of the glottis, or through an opening made artificially, or that it should simply be passed into the nostril. Some have suggested that the air introduced into the lungs shall be exactly measured by means of a graduated syringe; others, that the air should be previously warmed; and others, again, that

18 THE STUDIES REQUIRED FOR which you could not have understood otherwise. A patient, for example, has his legs swollen from ana- sarca ; the skin tense, inflamed, and likely to give way and ulcerate, or even threatened with gangrene. We make punctures with a needle; the fluid escapes, the tension is relieved, the inflammation subsides. But the relief is only temporary. The swelling depends on an obstruction to the return of the venous blood from the limb, produced by disease elsewhere, probably at a considerable distance from the part to which our attention has been principally directed. To prevent a recurrence of the mischief in the legs, we must endeavour to remove, or, if that cannot be accomplished, to palliate, the original disease. Another patient suffers from inflammation of the synovial membrane, which lines the knee. The joint is painful, and distended with fluid. Perhaps we are told a history of some sprain ; but on inquiry it is evident that the accident was so slight, that it will not account for the symptoms. We have recourse to leeches, blisters, and liniments, and keep the limb in a state of repose; but al- though somewhat mitigated, the inflammation still lingers in the joint. In fact, we have not yet traced the disease to its origin. On further inquiry we find that there is a faulty digestion, with flatu- lence and acidity of the stomach after meals, and a copious secretion of lithate of ammonia by the kid- neys. In addition to our other remedies, we admi- nister purgatives, magnesia, small doses of mercury, and perhaps colchicum, and the disease subsides. Again, a case, whether simple or complicated, may be obscure ; so that we cannot well satisfy

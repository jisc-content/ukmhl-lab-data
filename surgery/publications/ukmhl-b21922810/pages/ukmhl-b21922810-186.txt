Where I recommend this use of the adhesive plaster, you will, of course, understand that other kinds of plaster than that to which this name is commonly applied will answer the same purpose. In some cases of varicose veins the skin is irritated by the resin which the common adhesive plaster contains, and you may then substitute for it the red plaster (the emplastrum thuris or emplastrum roborans of the old dispensatories) with a small admixture of soap-cerate : or, what is better still, the soap-plaster spread on the fungus or amadou used for the lighting of cigars.

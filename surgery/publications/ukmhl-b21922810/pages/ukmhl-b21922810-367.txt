351 MORTIFICATION. Mortification from Inflammation of Arteries. Any thing which obstructs the passage of blood completely through the arteries of a limb will, of course, produce mortification. A single ligature, placed on an artery, does not do so, because it obstructs the main trunk only at one point, and there are anastomosing vessels communicating with the artery above and below the ligature, which are sufficient to carry on the circulation. But, sup- pose that, instead of one ligature, you were to put on half a dozen, at different distances from each other, in the space of six or seven inches of the artery, you would not only render the arterial trunk, but the anastomosing branches also, inca- pable of carrying on the circulation; and this would produce gangrene. I imagine that such a thing never was done by a surgeon upon the human subject, but something corresponding to it may happen from disease. As long ago as when I was house-surgeon in this hospital, 1 went to see a poor man at Brompton, under the following cir- cumstances. On a very hot summerâ€™s day, in August, he was walking in the fields, when he felt a sense of pricking, numbness, and weight, as he described it, in both lower extremities. It was with great difficulty that he crawled home. In one of the lower extremities these sensations sub- sided, but not so in the other. On the following day, the whole of the limb, from the toes to the middle of the thigh, was in a state of mortification. The mortification never extended afterwards ; no vesications formed on the foot; it was not swol-

ULCERS OF THE LEGS. 187 stop the circulation through it, I found, on taking- off the bandage, the patient being in the erect posture, that the cluster of veins below filled very slowly, and only from the capillary vessels. But if, the patient being in the erect posture, I removed the pressure from the vein, the valves being of no use, the blood rushed downwards by its own weight, contrary to the course of the circulation, and filled the varicose cluster below almost instantaneously. I can understand that a ligature upon the vena saphena under these circum- stances, would in a great degree lessen the incon- venience arising from the distension of the varicose veins below. It would answer the same purpose as the pressure of my thumb, but still it is not to be supposed that the good thus obtained would be permanent, or that it would be sufficient to coun- terbalance the chance of mischief resulting from the operation. I was occupied, many years ago, in making- experiments on the obliteration, not of the vena saphena, but of the varices themselves. I applied the caustic potash so as to penetrate through the skin to the veins below, and in this way I cured varicose ulcers. Mr. Mayo has, as I have been informed, employed the same practice lately, with this difference : he has applied the caustic not so as to make a slough of the vein, but so as to bring on sufficient inflammation to cause it to become obliterated. The result of my own experi- ments with the caustic may be told in very few words. The application of it was very painful; the slough took a long time to separate ; the sore

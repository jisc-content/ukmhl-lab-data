DEATH FROM LIGHTNING. 102 closely watched, it was not observed that he breathed once after he had received the shock. Three minutes afterwards I opened the chest, and found the heart acting with regularity and vigour, about eighty times in a minute, and circulating dark-coloured venous blood. The peristaltic mo- tion of the intestines also continued. On dis- section, no preternatural appearances presented themselves in any part of the body, and the mus- cles contracted readily when submitted to the influ- ence of a voltaic battery. In this experiment it was evident that the electric shock did not destroy the irritability of the mus- cular fibre, nor did it affect the action of the heart. Death took place precisely in the same manner as from a severe injury of the head, and the animal died manifestly from the destruction of the func- tions of the brain. There can be no doubt that if the lungs had been regularly inflated, the action of the heart would have been maintained; and very probably in this, as in many other instances where the cause of death operates especially on the brain, by persevering in the process of artificial respiration the animal would have been restored to life. In a third experiment there were corresponding results, although death was not the immediate consequence of the injury. The animal lay on one side; the heart was distinguished acting through the ribs, and he continued to respire; he was totally insensible, except when roused, and then he gave some imperfect signs of sensibility, like a person suffering from concussion of the brain. There were occasional convulsive actions

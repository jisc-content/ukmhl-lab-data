354 MORTIFICATION. the thigh. In performing the operation, he was surprised to find that no blood flowed from the stump, in consequence of the vessels being oblite- rated. The parts divided in the operation had not a sufficient supply of blood for the healing process. The stump mortified, as the leg had done before, and the patient died. It appeared to me, after the evidence afforded by this case, that it was desirable to avoid an operation, if possible. At the same time, I ought to mention, that in the second volume of the Medical Observations and Inquiries, there is an account of another case of the same kind, in which amputation was success- fully performed, the stump healing favourably. One of the circumstances most deserving of notice in these cases is, that the limb mortifies to a certain extent, and that then the mortification stops. This, however, is easily explained. We know that the obliteration of an artery must pre- vent the supply of blood to certain parts, but no further. Another peculiarity is, that the parts become dry, hard, horny; which condition of them has given rise to the name of dry gangrene. This is easily explained also. If mortification be the result of inflammation or of venous obstruction, there is always an effusion of serum, before the parts completely die, in the form of vesication of the skin and oedema of the cellular membrane ; and then, when the parts die, being infiltrated with serum, they readily become putrid. But here the supply of blood is cut off; the blood is prevented from entering the limb, so that there can be neither vesication on the surface nor effusion of serum into

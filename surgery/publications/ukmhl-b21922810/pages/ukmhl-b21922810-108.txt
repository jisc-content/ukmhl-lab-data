92 DEATH FROM DROWNING. 44 eries, and accompanied the divers to the banks, 44 consider one minute and a half to be the longest “ period during which any diver remains under 44 water. Other gentlemen, who are willing to allow 44 the greatest latitude, say that they certainly 44 never knew a diver to exceed two minutes.” It is probable that this last is above the proper estimate; and Dr. Davy who resided for a con- siderable time in Ceylon, who did not, indeed, witness the pearl-fishery himself, but had ample opportunities of procuring authentic information from others, assures me that the average time of diving is less than a minute. We cannot suppose it to be even so long as this, unless we also sup- pose that the diver descends immediately after a deep inspiration, so that he carries down a certain quantity of air with him. With respect to the fables of drowned persons reported to have been restored to life after sub- mersion for so long a period, it may be just to remark, that although most of them may have originated in a disposition to exaggerate, and to convert events which are interesting into events which are marvellous, it is probable that some of them may be attributed to unintentional error. A man in the act of drowning may rise more than once to the surface of the wrater, each time inhaling a supply of air by which his destruction may be retarded. I suppose, moreover, that it is not probable that a person on the bank of a river would observe another, who is drowning, with a watch in his hand, so as to reckon the exact number of minutes which elapse before this terrible

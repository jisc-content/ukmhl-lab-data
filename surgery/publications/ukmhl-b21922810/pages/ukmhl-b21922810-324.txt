MORTIFICATION. 308 splints, and drew a very tight bandage over them round the foot. The next day the man was in a great deal of pain and suffering. The bandage was removed, but it had already occa- sioned a broad slough of the skin over the instep. I have, in other instances, seen sloughs produced in the same manner, almost instantaneously, in consequence of bandages being applied too tight. But in the greater number of cases where mortification is the result of pressure, it does not occur immediately, but after the lapse of some time ; and it is not a direct, but a secondary con- sequence of the pressure. A man, for instance, is bed-ridden; he lies on a hard mattrass; he becomes emaciated; the skin over the os sacrum becomes tender to the touch ; it inflames, assuming a dark red colour ; vesications form upon it; the inflammation goes on, and ends in mortification. Pressure, then, may produce immediate mortifica- tion in some instances, but in ordinary cases it does so by causing inflammation first, which inflammation, the pressure being continued, ends in the same manner. This kind of mortification from pressure takes place under certain circumstances more readily than under others. A patient is weakened by con- tinued fever, and, from the state of debility in which he then is, pressure on the skin over the os sacrum, the great trochanter, or other projecting parts of bone, will produce mortification, while it would not produce it if he were in a state of health. After injuries of the spinal chord mortifica- tion from pressure is very readily induced. In

295 MORTIFICATION, u 4 letting, on the other hand, is improper, though aperient medicine may be required, very active purgatives should be avoided : the patient should be allowed such diet as his stomach is capable of digesting; and he should have wine or ale, or even brandy or gin ; the quality, as well as the quantity of the stimulus varying according to the character of the symptoms, and his previous habits.

Decoction of bark, quinine, and other tonics, may be useful under certain circumstances ; but I must say that the longer I live, and the more I see of these cases, the less is my faith in such remedies, while inflammation and mortification are going one; and I am satisfied that they often do great harm, by loading the stomach, and inter- fering with the digestion of food.

321 MORTIFICATION. sooner than that made by another. The period occupied by the separation of the slough seems to depend on the quantity of surrounding inflam- mation. If the inflammation at the margin be considerable, the slough is soon thrown off, whereas, if it be trifling, it may remain attached for a long period. If the caustic be applied merely to granulations, the slough separates much sooner than if it be applied to the skin, or to other parts of original structure. There is no class of cases in which you will have such frequent occasion to apply caustic as those of exuberant granulations, such as are com- monly called proud flesh. In some cases in which there is little disposition to form new skin, while the granulations rise above the level of the skin in the neighbourhood, it is important that the granulations should be reduced in size. On these occasions we commonly use the nitrate of silver, and it is for the most part sufficient for the purpose. You rub the part with it pretty freely, and the next day the exuberant granulations have disappeared, partly by sloughing and partly by absorption. There are, however, occasions on which you will find a large irregular mass of unhealthy granula- tions beyond what the nitrate of silver will easily destroy. Such granulations as those to which I now allude are frequently generated over a carious surface of bone, and you will then find the ointment which I am about to mention to be an excellent caustic application. It is a very old prescription, but not the worse on that account. The ointment consists of verdigris, sulphate of copper, and the Y

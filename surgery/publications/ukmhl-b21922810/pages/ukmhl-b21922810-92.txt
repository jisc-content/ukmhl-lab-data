EFFECTS OF STRANGULATION. 76 oxygen gas should be employed instead of atmos- pheric air. Before we consider the value of the several suggestions, I may observe, that in these cases, for the most part, you must be content to do the best in your power with the machinery which you have at hand. You may have a graduated syringe in your possession, or an apparatus for warming the air, or a gasometer full of oxygen gas, but you cannot carry them always with you; your house may be a mile, or even ten miles off, and while you are sending for what you think you want, the precious moments are running away, and your patient is gone for ever. And the fact is, that none of these things are necessary. There is no reason to believe that warm air is better than cold, perhaps it is not so good; and there is great reason to believe that pure oxygen gas is not fitted for respiration, and, at any rate, that it is much inferior to that happy mix- ture which constitutes the air of the atmosphere.* * This opinion is fully confirmed by some very interesting observations made by Mr. S. D. Broughton, F. R. S., and pub- lished in the twenty-eighth volume of the Quarterly Journal of Science, Literature, and Art. Animals confined in vessels filled with oxygen gas, after a certain time, fell into a state of stupor, as if under the influence of a narcotic poison, and died. The heart continued to act after respiration had ceased ; and if artificial respiration was had recourse to, and the lungs inflated with common air, the animal was restored to life. These effects were produced although the air was so little deteriorated that a second animal, introduced into it after the first animal had been poisoned, breathed for a time with perfect ease. In these experiments the blood in the veins had the same bright scarlet colour with that in the arteries.

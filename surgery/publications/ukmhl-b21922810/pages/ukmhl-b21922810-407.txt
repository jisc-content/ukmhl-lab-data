MORTIFICATION. 391 and it is always desirable to know what a disease will be if you let it alone; but, nevertheless, I do not advise you to let this alone. Until there is an opening in the skin, until the pus begins to escape and the slough is exposed, the brawny hardness of the skin continues to spread. The slough and matter require an exit, and you must give them an exit by making a free crucial incision through the carbuncle. Make, not a small partial incision in the middle, but one which extends completely through the whole brawny tumor, from one side to the other, and then another at right angles to the first, also completely through the tumor and down to the bottom of it. If this be done effec- tually, and not too early, you will generally find that the progress of the induration is stopped. If it should, however, continue to extend, you must follow it with an incision on another day. These incisions being combined with good medical treatment, and attention to the constitution, the patient generally recovers. In making the incision you will find that you divide a thick slough of the cellular membrane, and it has a peculiar appear- ance, as I have already explained, in consequence of its being infiltrated with lymph and pus, so that when it comes awTay it is more than the mere destruction of the living parts will account for. After you have made the incisions you may apply a poultice to the part, and change it three or four times daily. It is not uncommon to apply some digestive ointment, such as used to be called basilicon, or the unguentum elemi compositum ; it being supposed that this favours the separation of c c 4

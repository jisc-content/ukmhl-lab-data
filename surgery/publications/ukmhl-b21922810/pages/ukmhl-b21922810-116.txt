100 DEATH FROM LIGHTNING. ON THE MODE IN WHICH DEATH 18 PRODUCED BY A STROKE OF LIGHTNING. A stroke of lightning is a shock of electricity, and of course it may produce a great variety of effects, according to its intensity, and the part of the body through which it passes. A boy was admitted into Saint Georgeâ€™s Hospital under the following circumstances. He had several superficial sores on his abdomen and lower limbs, and he gave the following account of their origin. In the month of July, during a thunder-storm, he was sitting with several other persons under a hovel covered with thatch. A flash of lightning struck the hovel, and set fire to the thatch; the boy, and a woman who was of the party, fell senseless. The woman was instantaneously deprived of life; but the boy recovered his sensibility after the lapse of a few minutes. He had been drawn out of the hovel before he could feel any effects from the burning thatch, and his clothes were uninjured ; but shortly afterwards large vesications took place about the pubes and thighs, precisely resembling those which arise from a scald; and they terminated in a similar manner, that is, in producing ulcerations. It is evident that, in this case, the electricity must have acted chiefly on the surface of the body. A corresponding case is recorded in the sixty-sixth volume of the Philosophical Transactions. A bul- lock, which was pyed white and red, was exposed to a violent thunder-storm. A stroke of lightning consumed the white, but left the red hairs. In another volume of the Philosophical Transactions

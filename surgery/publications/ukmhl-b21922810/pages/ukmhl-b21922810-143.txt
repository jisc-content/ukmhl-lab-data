127 UNUNITED FRACTURES. like the cavity of a joint, in which the broken ends of the bone lie. And there is more than this : the rounded ends of the bone being covered by a thin, ligamentous substance, and the inner surface of capsule being lined by a smooth membrane, like the synovial membrane, and capable not only of secreting synovia, but of secreting it in abundance. The capsule is a new formation ; and the synovial membrane is a new formation also. It is not to be wondered that a synovial membrane should be formed under these circumstances. It seems very easy for the system to construct a membrane of this description. The bursae mucosae are made of synovial membrane, just like that of the joints. There is a bursa between the patella and the skin, and this in housemaids sometimes becomes dis- eased, and converted into a hard lump or tumor. I have frequently removed such a tumor from the knee of a housemaid, and some time afterwards, on examining the limb, I have been satisfied that the bursa had been regenerated. Nor is this a mere supposition ; I have positive proof that the fact is as I have stated it. There was a woman in the hospital from whose knee the late Mr. Rose removed an enlarged bursa. A year or two after- wards she returned, and came under my care ; and not only had the bursa been regenerated, but the new one had become diseased like the old one, and I had to repeat the operation which Mr. Rose had performed formerly. She had gone back to her former occupation, which included a good deal of kneeling, and, under the influence of pressure, the new bursa had become converted into the same

352 MORTIFICATION. len, and no part became putrid, except just a little in the middle of the thigh, where there was a great mass of soft parts. The limb dried, the skin assum- ing a brownish colour, being, at the same time, hard and semi-transparent, so that the white tendons could be seen shining through it. It was, in fact, what has been called a case of dry gan- grene. The poor fellow went on very well for four or five weeks, without any bad symptoms, during which time the separation of the dead parts in the thigh had made considerable progress. But it was more than nature could accomplish to com- plete the work. His powers, at last, began to fail, and he died at the end of six weeks from the commencement of the attack. I examined the body, and found marks of inflammation everywhere about the principal artery and vein of the limb. From the bifurcation of the iliac trunk down to the middle of the thigh, the artery was obliterated, being completely filled with coagulated lymph, evidently effused from inflammation, closely adher- ing to the inner surface, but with some admixture of red coagulum. The vein also was filled with lymph, and obliterated in the same manner as the artery. There had been inflammation of the sheath of the vessels, in consequence of which the artery and the vein adhered closely to each other, and to the surrounding parts, so that the dissection was some- what difficult. The nature of the case seems to be plain enough.

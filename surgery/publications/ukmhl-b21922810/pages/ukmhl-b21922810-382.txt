MORTIFICATION. 366 died. Indeed, it appears to me, that we have no right to expect that this mode of treatment should be successful. There is inflammation, it is true ; but if the inflammation terminates in morti- fication, it is because the part, on the principle which I formerly explained, cannot obtain that additional supply of blood which an inflamed part requires.. Now, if you abstract blood, and thereby lessen the quantity in the system and weaken the action of the heart, the supply of blood to the limb must be diminished, and the cause of the disease aggravated. An opposite plan of treatment to this has been recommended by others. They have said, “ This is “ a disease of weakness ; give bark, quinine, ser- “ pentaria, and other tonics.” Now' there are certain kinds of debility which will be relieved by these remedies, but here there is only a local weakness, depending on disease of the blood- vessels Will such remedies as these mend the con- dition of the arteries ?

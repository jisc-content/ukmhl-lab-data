ADMINISTRATION OF MERCURY 232 lower order of prostitutes, are, as you may sup- pose, very liable to become affected with syphilis. For a year or two he treated every soldier labour- ing under the disease that came into the regi- mental hospital without mercury. I had frequent opportunities of seeing these cases, and from time to time I watched their progress with him. Every sore upon the organs of generation got well under his management. Many of them, probably, were not venereal, but of course many of them were. Not only did the sores heal, but the consequent hardness of the cicatrix disappeared. Some of the secondary symptoms were slight, and others were severe ; in fact exhibiting nearly the usual cha- racter ; but they were removed without the use of mercury. Mercury was had recourse to in only two or three cases, and there it was rendered necessary to save the eye, in consequence of inflammation of the iris supervening. From these facts Mr. Rose came to a conclusion, which these cases certainly seemed to justify, namely, that syphilis was curable without the use of mercury. Other army surgeons repeated these, experiments with the same results ; and I believe that the disease is even now treated in the army to a great extent on the same system. These observations led a certain part of our profession to a view of the subject entirely different from that wdiich had been entertained previously. They not only alleged that mercury was unneces- sary for the cure of syphilis, but that it did a great deal of harm, and that the introduction of it into the system was actually worse than the disease which it was intended to cure.

160 VARICOSE VEINS AND the body after death, it was found that there was disease in the bronchial glands; suppuration had taken place in them, and a large abscess had been confined in the inside of the chest, which pressed on the right subclavian vein, and this caused the blood to stagnate in the veins in which it had its origin, and which had in consequence become varicose. In another case, that of a private patient, whom I attended with Dr. Roots and Mr. Diamond, the superficial veins of the chest and upper extremities were extensively varicose, while the more urgent symptom was a great difficulty of respiration. The disease ended fatally; and on examining the body Mr. Diamond discovered a large medullary tumor within the chest, which, by its pressure on the lower part of the trachea and on the junction of the two subclavian veins, had obstructed at once the entrance of the air into the lungs and the return of the blood to the superior vena cava. In the first of the three cases to which I have just referred, I have said that the varicose disease of the fore-arm was the consequence of inflamma- tion and obliteration of the larger venous trunks ; and such is sometimes the cause of varicose veins of the legs. There was a man in the hospital, with varicose veins of the legs. It was one of the worst cases of the kind that I ever met with. He had been, however, admitted into the hospital on account of another disease, of which he died. I examined the body after death, and found an obliteration of the external iliac vein. This vein had been inflamed at some former period, and had

8 THE STUDIES REQUIRED FOR few among you who have the opportunity of re- maining in the schools during a period of five or six years may do well to devote even two entire winters to anatomy before they begin their attendance on the hospital practice. But I cannot give this advice to the majority of those whom I now address, and whose period of education is more limited. And here let me observe, that it is a great mistake to suppose, after the first anatomical session is over, that it is better for you to defer beginning your attendance on the hospital until the next autumn. You will, in fact, attend the hospital to greater advantage during the summer than at any other time. The same opportunities of experience pre- sent themselves at the hospital at one period as at another, and during the summer you can bestow a more undivided attention on what there occurs than you can during the winter. While engaged in attendance on the hospital, al- ways bear in mind that there is no one of your other studies which, as to real importance, can compete with this. The lectures on anatomy, chemistry, materia medica, practice of medicine and surgery, and midwifery, are nothing in themselves. They are but the means to an end, and are valuable only because without them you would be unable to learn the symptoms and treatment of diseases in the hos- pital. I feel it my duty to make this observation, and to make it earnestly, because it appears to me that the truth which it inculcates is not, for the most part, sufficiently impressed on the minds of medical students. Perhaps, however, if strict jus- tice were done to all concerned, and we were to

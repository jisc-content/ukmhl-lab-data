MORTIFICATION. 312 well, for when patients are bed-ridden they wash the parts subjected to pressure with brandy. What is still better is a lotion composed of two grains of the bichloride of mercury to an ounce of proof spirits. When you think that a patient is likely to be confined so long in bed that sloughs may be formed on the os sacrum, begin at an early period to wash the parts two or three times a day with this lotion.

UNUNITED FRACTURES. 134 limbs was reduced to one inch and a half. I have adopted the same treatment in two cases under my own care, one of them being that of a patient in this hospital with an ununited fracture of the arm, the other that of a private patient with an ununited fracture of the bones of the fore-arm, and in both cases with success. In this mode of treatment the pressure must be considerable, so as to cause some inconvenience to the patient both from pain and from swelling of the limb below. But the inconvenience is only temporary. If at the end of a certain time you find that no union has taken place, still you leave the patient as well as you found him, and he has at any rate the satisfaction of knowing that you have done all that could be done for his relief. The principle of Mr. Amesburyâ€™s practice is simply that of keeping the ends of the bones in perfect repose, and at the same time applying pressure, particularly on the broken surfaces, so as to keep them in the closest possible contact with each other. Of course no general rule can be laid down as to the mode of attaining this object. In a case of transverse fracture, one kind of appa- ratus must be employed, in one of oblique fracture another, and in one of comminuted fracture a third. The apparatus will also differ accordingly as it is a fracture of the arm, the fore-arm, the leg, or the thigh. In a case of oblique fracture a very simple apparatus will do all that is required. Secure the limb by fastening it to a single rather broad wooden splint. Apply a pad of thick leather on each side of the fracture, and then a tourniquet, by which

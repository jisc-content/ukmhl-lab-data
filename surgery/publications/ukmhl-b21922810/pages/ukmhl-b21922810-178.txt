VARICOSE VEINS AND 162 the grenadier companies are especially subject to varicose veins, they being taller men than the other soldiers. Cooks are very subject to varicose veins, and the reason is plain. If you put one hand into warm water, and the other into cold, you know that the veins of the former will become dilated, and that those of the latter will contract. But where the disposition to the disease exists, do all the veins become dilated ? By no means. The deep-seated veins never become varicose, be- cause there is the pressure of other organs upon them on every side, which prevents their dilatation. It is only the superficial veins that are thus affected; especially the branches of the vena sa- phena major, but sometimes of the vena saphena posterior. But the valves do not increase with the dilatation of the vein ; they remain of their original size. The consequence is, that the valves do not protect the venous branches below from the pressure of the column of blood above ; that they do not answTer the purpose of valves any longer; and the want of action in the valves tends, of course, to aggravate the disease. By and by the valves seem to become changed in structure ; they are shrivelled, and become at last good for nothing, not even looking like valves. This is in conformity with a general law of the animal economy. A part which is not used wastes. If you were to tie up one eye, and cover it from the light for many years, you would find at last that you could not see with it. Muscles not used will waste; and so it is with all other organs.

180 VARICOSE VEINS AND unguentum elemi composition, or some oint- ment of the same kind, plain or diluted. But as soon as the inflammation of the ulcer and the surrounding parts has been relieved, you may begin the application of pressure. The pressure of a common roller will do a great deal of good, and formerly nothing else was recommended. But we find, now, that in cases of varicose ulcer, as in cases of indolent ulcer of the leg, you may very much assist the common roller by the addition of other means. One very good way of making pressure on a varicose ulcer is to interpose between it and the bandage a piece of sheet lead, such as is used in anatomical museums for covering preparations. The lead should be made quite smooth, and larger than the ulcer, so as to extend beyond its margin. This makes a very uniform pressure, and really does very well. But, for the most part, we are in the habit of using pressure by means of plaster applied in a circular manner round the limb. It is common to employ stripes of linen spread with soap or adhesive plaster; but on the whole the diachylon plaster is to be preferred, for both soap plaster and adhesive plaster will at times irritate the skin, and bring on inflammation and pustules, while diachylon plaster scarcely ever produces this effect. In some cases it is desirable to employ only a very moderate degree of pressure in the first instance; and on these occasions you will find a mixture, of one part of spermaceti cerate to three parts of the diachylon, to answer the intended purpose. It may be spread on calico, cut in stripes, and applied in the usual manner.

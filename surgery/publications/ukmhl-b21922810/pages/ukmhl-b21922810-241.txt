CORNS AND BUNIONS* 225 Now, the consequence of all this is, that the head of the metatarsal bone makes an unnatural pro- minence, and is more acted on by the pressure ot the shoe than it would be otherwise. The cuticle becomes thickened, not at one particular point, but over a considerable surface ; and underneath the skin a large and very distinct bursa is generated between it and the bone. The difference between what I have now described and a common corn may reasonably be attributed to the large size of the head of the first metatarsal bone, and to the consequent diffusion of the pressure over a broad surface. When a bunion is once formed, the bursa belonging to it is liable to become inflamed after any unusual degree of exercise, or on it being sub- jected to the pressure of a more than commonly tight shoe. Serum is then effused into the cavity of the bursa ; the swelling is much increased, and it becomes, at the same time, exquisitely painful and tender. If the patient remains at rest, the inflammation subsides, the serum effused into the bursa becomes absorbed, and the additional swel- ling disappears without any further ill con- sequences. If, however, he continues to walk about, wearing, at the same time, a tight shoe, the inflammation proceeds further; suppuration takes place, and an abscess is formed. Such an abscess is slow in reaching the surface ; the patient generally suffers severely before it bursts exter- nally; and when it has burst, as the synovial membrane of the bursa granulates with difficulty, the healing of the abscess is very tedious, the parts Q

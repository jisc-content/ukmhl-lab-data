ADMINISTRATION OF MERCURY 240 away three or four months more, he came to us a third time, with a recurrence of his old symptoms. I again resorted to sarsaparilla, and the eruptions yielded, but more slowly than on the previous occasions. Towards the conclusion of the time that he was in the hospital iritis supervened, for which I gave him the bichloride of mercury for a short time, until the iritis had subsided. Some two or three months afterwards the disease again broke out, with nearly the same symptoms as before. Now he went into the Lock Hospital, under the care of the late Mr. Blair. This was fourteen months after he first came to Saint George’s, and he had taken no mercury, except for the iritis, during the whole of that time. Mr. Blair now, very properly, put him under a course of mercurial inunction, and I believe that he was permanently cured. If I had done this when he first came under my care he would probably have died. I might mention other cases illustrative of the same point if it were worth while to do so. I have said that, in the great majority of cases, mercury is the best remedy which you can employ for the cure of syphilis ; provided always, that it be judiciously and properly administered. There are different ways of exhibiting mercury. It may be given internally ; it may be applied externally, in the form of ointment, or by the method of fumiga- tion. The mercurial preparations that are given in- ternally are various; blue pill, the liydrargyum cum creta, calomel and opium, Plummer’s pill, iodide of mercury, bichloride of mercury, and some others.

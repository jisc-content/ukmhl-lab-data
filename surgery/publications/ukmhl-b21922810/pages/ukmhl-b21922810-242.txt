226 CORNS AND BUNIONS. remaining all the time in a very irritable and painful state. For the relief of this bunion, when it is free from inflammation, or inflamed only in a slight degree, the following plan of treatment should be adopted.

This should be cut somewhat into the figure of a horse- shoe ; and it should be then applied so that the bunion may be in the empty space, and relieved from the pressure of the shoe, which is thus thrown on the surrounding surface. The advantage of the horse-shoe-like opening, over a more circular opening, is that the soft parts do not bulge into the former as they do into the latter. If, however, the bursa be much inflamed, the patient should be confined to the couch, without a shoe. Leeches may be applied in the neighbourhood, and the parts may be fomented with hot water.

This may be changed afterwards for soap-cerate, or zinc ointment, or other mild dressing.

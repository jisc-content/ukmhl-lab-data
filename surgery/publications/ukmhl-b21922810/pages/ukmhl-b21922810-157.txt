OF THE FEMALE BREAST. 141 protrudes through the opening. And here the question arises,—what is the exact nature of changes, which, by a gradual operation, at last converts a disease, so small and simple in its origin, into one so extensive and complicated ? This I shall next endeavour to explain ; and a series of preparations on the table, with the his- tories of the cases belonging to them, will enable me to do so. The first of these is a membranous cyst, which I removed from the breast of a private patient. It is of the size of a large walnut; and you will observe that about one fourth part of its cavity is occupied by an irregularly shaped excrescence attached to one portion of its internal surface. Several years ago Mr. Green and myself were present when Mr. Freeman, of Spring Gardens, removed the breast of a female with a similar tumor imbedded in it. The tumor was of about the same size as that which I have j ust shown you ; and in my notes of the case I find it stated, that “ the cyst “ contained serum, but that about one third part “ of its cavity was occupied by an excrescence “ which grew from one portion of its inner surface. “ The excrescence had the appearance of fibrine “ which had become vascular.” The history of the patient whose case has fur- nished us with the next preparation, and the accompanying drawing, is highly interesting, and illustrates many circumstances connected with this disease. This lady consulted me in the month of October 1837 respecting a tumor of the breast, which might be compared as to size to a large nutmeg. It was

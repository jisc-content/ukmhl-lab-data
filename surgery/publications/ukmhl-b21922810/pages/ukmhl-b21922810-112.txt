96 DEATH FROM DROWNING. life, not having passed through the capillaries of the general system since it was exposed to the influence of the air in the lungs. When the animal plunges beneath the waves, and respiration is suspended, the scarlet blood in the plexuses must gradually become mixed with the dark- coloured blood that is returned from other parts, and this admixture cannot fail to render the whole mass of the circulating blood more pure, and better adapted to the maintenance of the animal functions, than it would have been otherwise. Is it not then reasonable to suppose that this peculiar structure enables the whale to subsist with longer intervals between his respirations than other warm- blooded animals ? If it does not answer this purpose, what other purpose is there for which it can be designed ? It may be observed, moreover, that some of the principal plexuses are connected with the vessels of the brain and spinal chord, as if it were intended that this reservoir of arterial blood should especially belong to these organs, to which the dark-coloured venous blood is the most injurious. If an animal be taken out of the water before he is completely drowned, and the diaphragm con- tracts afterwards, so as to draw air into the lungs, before the action of the heart has ceased, the action of the heart is maintained, and the animal continues to respire. Nevertheless, although he has recovered from the first effects of the injury, his ultimate recovery remains uncertain ; and after drowning, as after strangulation, there is a second period at which death may take place. The animal lies

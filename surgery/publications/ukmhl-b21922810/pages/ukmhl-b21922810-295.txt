279 ADIPOSE TUMORS. t 4 because the alkali neutralizes every drop of vinegar which it contains. Perhaps the diuretic salt which is formed by this combination is advantageous ; but, besides this, the alkali is less ungrateful to the taste when taken in beer than when taken in any other vehicle. However, there are some persons with whom malt liquor really disagrees, even when an alkali is added to it, and there are others who cannot be persuaded that it does not do so; and then milk and water, clove tea, ginger tea, or veal broth may be substituted for it. Under these cir- cumstances, however, the alkali should be exhi- bited in somewhat smaller doses than when dissolved in beer, as none of it is neutralized. There is another remarkable kind of fatty tumor, which is, however, of very rare occurrence. A young gentleman had three or four tumors in different parts of his person, which resembled common fatty tumors, except that they were of a firmer consistence His friends wished that they should be removed. In performing the operation, I found them to be composed of a rather dense fat, covered by a reflected membrane, not less perfect than the peritonaeum or pleura, or any other reflected membrane of original formation. There was one layer covering the tumor itself, except at one point, where it was attached to the adeps in the neighbourhood ; and there was another layer, forming a loose bag, in which the tumor seemed to be pendulous, and which was moistened by a halitus. How you are to distin- guish these tumors from other fatty tumors pre- viously to an operation, I do not know.

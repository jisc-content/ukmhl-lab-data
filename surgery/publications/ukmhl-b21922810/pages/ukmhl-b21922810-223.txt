WHICH REQUIRE AN OPERATION. 207 other mischief, some time afterwards. Then take care not to keep the patient very low before the operation. What used to be termed preparing for an operation by low diet is always wrong. The patient need not to be stuffed and crammed with food before an operation, and she should have her bowels emptied ; but as to repeated purging, and very low diet, that is not right, either before an operation or after it. An operation is a shock to the system, making a great demand upon the vital powers; and if you take away whatever stimulus and food the patient is accustomed to, the con- stitution, probably, will not bear it. So far, I say, the success of the operation is, to a certain extent, under your control; but there are also unfavour- able circumstances which you cannot influence. For instance, in a large fat woman, with an enor- mous breast, the operation is frightful. There is an immense wound, and there will probably be great haemorrhage in spite of all your care. An old woman will not support the operation like a person less advanced in life. You are to look upon an operation, especially if there be a large incision, in an elderly person, as always attended with a certain degree of danger; and so it is when the patient is of a delicate and fragile constitution. For example, those women whom you meet with frequently in private practice, with an hysterical nervous system, a small pulse, and cold hands and feet, are always unfavourable subjects for opera- tions, especially for those that are attended with even a moderate loss of blood. In such women as these you are to avoid an operation, if possible.

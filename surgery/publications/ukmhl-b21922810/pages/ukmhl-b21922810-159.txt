OF THE FEMALE BREAST. 143 protruding through the skin formed the external fungus. You will see these appearances distinctly visible in the preparation, although not so plainly as before the parts were immersed in alcohol; and they are well represented in this drawing, which is made with Mr. Perryâ€™s usual accuracy. The structure of the morbid growth seems to be of the simplest kind. I can compare it to nothing else than hbrine imperfectly organized. Its existence does not seem to be limited to the inside of the cyst, a considerable mass being on the outside, in immediate contact with the gland of the breast. Previously to the operation the remaining part of the breast appeared to be in a healthy condition ; but on dissection afterwards, I found imbedded in it a great number of membranous cysts, of various sizes, from that of a pea to that of a horse-bean. These cysts contained a transparent yellow serum, and were evidently of the same nature with the larger cyst which I had formerly punctured, and in which the fungus had originated afterwards. The preparation which I now show you leads me to the history of a patient who is still under the care of Mr. Keate, in this hospital. Fifteen months ago, being then an out-patient, she had a tumor of the left breast, above the nipple, of the size of a walnut. It was globular and moveable. Mr. Cutler punctured it with a grooved needle, and ascertained that it contained serum. Soon afterwards it was found that a fluid, similar to that which had escaped by the puncture, was dis- charged by the nipple. From this time the tumor gradually increased in size. Six weeks ago

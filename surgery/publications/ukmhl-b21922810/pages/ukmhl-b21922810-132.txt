UNUNITED FRACTURES. 116 simple: and, in fact, does not correspond with what is found in nature. The real process is one of considerable complication. I made several experiments upon animals, many years ago, with a view to the elucidation of this subject. The results are displayed in a series of preparations contained in the museum of this hospital, and some of which, with explanatory drawings, are now on the table. I had proposed at that time to publish a paper on the union of fractures ; but before my investigations were completed, I found the whole matter to have been made out by Baron Dupuytren so completely, that any farther publi- cation on it was unnecessary. I broke the bones of animals, and examined the appearances at different periods afterwards. Immediately on a bone being broken, you find, a little blood extravasated; in general, also, the bones are considerably displaced, and riding one over another, owing to the animal not being quiet, and the unrestrained action of the muscles. For the first three or four days you see nothing more than you do immediately after the accident has occurred; but after this period there is a thickening, consolidation, and adhesion of the parts surrounding the fracture, and these changes ex- tend to the muscles and neighbouring tendons. In the course of a week all these parts become firmly united, one with the other, and there is a soft yet firm substance, something between ligament and cartilage in consistence, which sur- rounds the broken extremities of the bone. This newly-formed substance adheres to the bone above

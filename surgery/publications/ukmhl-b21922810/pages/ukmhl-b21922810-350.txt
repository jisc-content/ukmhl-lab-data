334 MORTIFICATION. may proceed in the following manner : first, make a crucial incision through the substance of the tumor with a lancet; then, as soon as the haemorrhage has ceased, apply the caustic potash in the incision. You may destroy the tumor if you please by letting the caustic act on the skin without using a lancet, but its destruction is much more easily accomplished in the manner which I have suggested. One application is generally sufficient; the slough comes away, and the sore heals. Perhaps it will be asked, Is there not this objection to the use of caustic : namely, that some time is necessary for the slough to come away; then a further time for the healing of the wound ? and does not all this make the process of cure more tedious than it would be if the knife were used instead ? The fact is, that a wound always heals much more readily after the application of caustic, than after the use of the knife. Take two cases : if you destroy one tumor of a given size by the knife, and the other, supposed to be of the same size, by caustic, in spite of the time occupied by the separation of the slough, the sore in the latter case will be healed sooner than that in the former. If the tumor be ulcerated, this is favourable rather than otherwise to the use of the caustic, because it saves the trouble of dividing the part with a lancet; when, however, the tumor has been of long standing, and has produced an extensive ulceration, the caustic potash will not well answer the purpose. There will be so much bleeding from the large surface that the caustic will expend its

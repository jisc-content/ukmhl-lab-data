221 CORNS AND BUNIONS. shoes be worn at the same time, the com will gradually disappear. A better material than the buck-skin for this purpose, however, is the amadou spread with soap plaster, which I have recom- mended on some other occasions. By laying one piece of the amadou over another it may be obtained of any thickness. In some cases a hard corn is formed on the lower surface of the foot, over the head of one of the metatarsal bones. A com in this situation is especially troublesome, rendering the patient absolutely lame. Some such method as that which I have just described is applicable to this case also; or an opening larger than the corn itself may be made in the upper sole of the shoe, so as to take all pressure from the corn. But here it is necessary that a thin piece of calico spread with adhesive plaster should be applied to that part of the foot in which the corn is situated. Without this contrivance, the flesh of the foot, when the patient walks, bulges or projects into the hole of the leather, and the patientâ€™s condition is ren- dered worse rather than better.

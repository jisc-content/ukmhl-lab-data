285 MORTIFICATION. of bone) : Thirdly, according to the state of the neighbouring living parts, without reference to that of the general system; thuÂ», if there be much inflammation in them, the ulcerative process proceeds more rapidly than when the inflammation is very slight: and, Lastly, as long as the mor- tification continues to spread there never is, and for obvious reasons cannot be, even the commence- ment of the process of separation. I have seen mortification begin in an old mans toe, and be gradually spreading, even for months, up the foot and leg, without the least appearance of a line of demarcation, or the least attempt at sloughing. In the same manner, a piece of dead bone may continue adherent to the living bone even for some years. If the disease on which the death of the bone depends can be arrested, as it some- times can (by mercury, for example, or by sarsa- parilla), the exfoliating process begins immediately, and when begun it is completed as soon as under ordinary circumstances. The separation of the dead part is followed by another series of changes, which terminate in healing, or cicatrization. But these changes are not at all different from those which occur when there is a loss of substance in other ways, and it is not my intention, therefore, to enter into the consideration of them at present. Having offered these general observations on the subject, I shall proceed to consider the various circumstances under which mortification may take place, and the treatment which it requires, accord- ingly as it arises from one cause or from another.

EFFECTS OF STRANGULATION. 80 thyroid and cricoid cartilages against the vertebrae so as to close the upper extremity of the oesophagus, otherwise a portion of air will at each closure of the bellows find its way into the stomach, gradually distending it until it prevents the descent of the diaphragm and the entrance of the air into the lungs altogether. The only source of danger in the operation of artificially inflating the lungs is that of the forcible impulsion of air into the circulating blood through the thin tunicks of the capillary vessels of the lungs ; and by attending to the precautions which have been just enumerated this accident is easily avoided. But the question will arise, May not the same object be attained by other means ? Undoubtedly the influence of voltaic electricity properly applied will bring the diaphragm and intercostal muscles into vigorous action, and may be used in physiological experiments as a substitute for the other method. But it is quite inapplicable in surgical practice. A pair of bellows may be obtained anywhere : but a voltaic battery, or any other apparatus that may be substituted for it, is not to be had at the moment, and even if it were, some time will be required for bringing it into operation, during which the heart will cease to act. But, further than this, even in physio- logical researches the voltaic battery is much less convenient than the bellows or the elastic gum bottle. To apply it properly an incision must be made in the neck, and another in the abdomen, for the purpose of applying the wire to the diaphragm, and even then its effects will not be

MORTIFICATION. 316 able force upon his feet. There was a compound fracture of the leg above the ancle. The external wound was trifling, but it wTas evident that a great shock had been given to the foot and the leg. Four days afterwards, the limb was in a state of mortification as high as the knee, and the morti- fiction seemed to be extending to the thigh. I amputated the thigh as high up as I could, near to the great trochanter. We dissected the limb very carefully afterwards. The large arteries, and also the large veins, were quite pervious. There was, in fact, no injury whatever to the arterial trunks, but the cellular membrane, the muscles, and, in short, all the structures, seemed to be more or less disorganised. There were spots of ecchymosis in the large nerves; the periosteum was universally detached from the fibula, and very nearly so from the tibia. The adhesion of the periosteum to the bone is by means of the small vessels. It is evi- dent, then, that the shock of the accident must have occasioned a great injury to the small vessels connecting the periosteum to the tibia and fibula; and the probability is, that the same kind of injury inflicted on all the capillary vessels of the limb laid the foundation for the mortification. I do not see how the occurrence of mortification, in cases like this, can otherwise be explained. It has been a sort of dictum of the schools of surgery that you should not amputate while mor- tification is going on ; and, certainly, where there is mortification from ossified arteries (as I shall hereafter explain), or where there is mortification from inflammation, you ought to wait for the

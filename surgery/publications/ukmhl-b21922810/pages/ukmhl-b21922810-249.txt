IN CASES OF SYPHILIS. 233 With respect to the recovery from syphilis without the aid of mercury, I may observe, that it appears to me that you cannot properly apply a rule, drawn from the observation of what happens in soldiers, to society in general. In all cases the effects of a disease depend very much on the kind of constitution that is attacked. Students coming from the country are often astonished by the dif- ference in recovery from compound fractures in a London hospital, and where they have seen them occur in a purer air, and in another order of persons. In London, the cholera destroyed 300 out of 18,000 inhabitants ; in Sunderland it carried off a very large proportion (I forget exactly what) of the population ; as it did in Paris also. In London, its destructive influence was felt, not among the affluent classes, but among those who were ill fed, ill clothed, and breathing a poisonous atmosphere. So I apprehend it to be with syphilis. Soldiers are persons of strong constitution, and in good health, otherwise they would not be received into the army. They are not much advanced in life; they are taken into a regimental hospital, are kept under the constant eye of the surgeon, and are dieted exactly as he pleases. The general health is attended to in every respect; they are not allowed to be exposed to the influence of atmospheric changes, and, in short, from their con- stitution, and from the situation in which they are placed, it may well be supposed that they have a power of throwing off morbid poisons not enjoyed by the great majority of other persons. Ex- perience fully confirms these observations. In this

The application of the chloride gives the patient a good deal of pain, which you must make him endure as well as you can, by the administration of opium. Some pa- tients suffer much more than others; some will not require any opium at all, others will require it in large doses. When the action of the caustic has ceased there is of course an end to the pain, and the slough comes away in a few days. If the ulcerated surface be of large size, and the disease of much depth, a second application may be required. When the disease is situated over a bone, I generally like to procure a thin exfoliation of the latter, and the caustic accomplishes this very well, acting on the bone, but not to any great depth. The exfoliation takes place in a few weeks ; and when the thin layer of dead bone has come away, healthy granulations are seen beneath. Sometimes, after having destroyed a great part of an ulcerated tumor with chloride of zinc, a small portion of it may be left here and there, to which you may apply the caustic potash or solution of arsenic in nitric acid. This solution of arsenic, or any other preparation of arsenic, may be applied to a small surface very safely. Observe, that what I object to is merely its application to a very large surface. I am told that the nitrate of zinc may be used as a caustic also, but I have no actual expe- rience of it. Ulcerated tumors, similar to those which occur on the face, are sometimes met with on the scalp; and these, too, may be destroyed with caustic.

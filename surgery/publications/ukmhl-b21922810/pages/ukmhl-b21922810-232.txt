216 CORNS AND BUNIONS. degree moist, and this gives rise to the distinction between hard and soft corns. I shall speak to you of hard corns first; of soft corns afterwards. A hard corn, when it begins to be formed, is productive of no other inconvenience than of a slight degree of pain and tenderness after much exercise. The pain and tenderness increase, so that the patient in the evening is glad to take off his leathern shoe, and put on a woollen slipper. Then the whole foot, after exercise, is hot and uneasy. These symptoms subside with rest, and the absence of pressure, during the night, but return with the wearing of the shoe and exercise during the day.

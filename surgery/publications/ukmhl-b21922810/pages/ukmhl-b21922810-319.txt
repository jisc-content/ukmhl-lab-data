303 MORTIFICATION. LECTURE XVI. ON MORTIFICATIONâ€”continued. Mortification from Ligature. I now call your attention to some other varieties of mortification. A ligature drawn round any part of the body, so as to intercept the communication with the great vessels and the heart, may cause that part to perish. But the effect of the ligature is not the same in all cases; and it does not always produce mortification in the same way. You apply a bandage round the arm before you bleed a patient, to make the veins of the fore-arm become distended, the object being merely to impede the circulation in the superficial veins. If you take it off at the end of a few minutes, the hand is at once just as it was before the ligature was applied. If you were to leave it on twelve hours, the whole hand and fore-arm would become swollen, and would remain swollen for some time after the bandage was removed. The swelling in such a case arises from the congested state of the veins, and from the consequent effusion of the serum of the blood into the cellular membrane. The first effect, then, of a ligature which obstructs the circulation without arresting it completely, is to

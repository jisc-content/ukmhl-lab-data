360 MORTIFICATION. animal food, are the persons principally afflicted with this disease, and not the labouring poor. Ossification of the arteries is a change that can take place only gradually ; and the obliteration of them being for the most part the result of a gradual process also, you will easily believe that certain praemonitory symptoms may arise in the lower limb before the disease is gone so far as to produce mortification. If you cross-examine a patient who has mortification of the toes, he will generally tell you, that for three or four years preceding, he has had occasional pains in the lower limbs ; a sense of numbness in them ; that his feet were liable to be cold ; that when they again become warm, after having been cold, they have been very painful ; and that he has had a sense of weakness of the muscles. Such patients walk a short distance very well, but when they attempt more than this the muscles seem to be unequal to the task, and they can walk no further. The muscles are not absolutely paralyzed, but in a state approaching to it. The cause of all this is suffi- ciently obvious. The lower limbs require sometimes a larger and sometimes a smaller supply of blood. During exercise a larger supply is wanted on account of the increased action of the muscles ; but the arteries being ossified or obliterated, and thus incapable of dilatation, the increased supply cannot be obtained. This state of things is not peculiar to the lower limbs. Wherever muscular structures exist, the same cause will produce the same effect. Dr. Jenner first, and Dr. Parry, of Bath, afterwards, published observations which were supposed to

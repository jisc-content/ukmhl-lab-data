SERO-CYSTIC TUMORS 138 has been taken principally from cases of this kind, and there are also some allusions to it in the Treatise on Diseases of the Breast lately published by M. Velpeau. The first perceptible indication of the disease is a globular tumor imbedded in the glandular structure of the breast, and to a certain extent moveable underneath the skin. Sometimes there is only one such tumor ; at other times there are two or three, or many more. The examination of the breast in the living person does not enable you to determine the exact number which exist, as it is only where they have attained a certain mag- nitude that they are perceptible through the skin. In most instances the disease is confined to one breast, though it is by no means very uncommon for both breasts to be similarly affected. The globular form which the tumor invariably assumes in the first instance, is a sufficient proof that it is formed of fluid collected in a cyst, and of course pressing equally in every direction. If you puncture the tumor with a grooved needle, the fluid may be evacuated so as completely to empty the cyst, and the perfect subsidence of it afterwards proves how little space the cyst itself occupies. The fluid is always serous. When the tumor is small it seems to be serum unmixed with any thing else. In a more advanced stage of the disease, some colouring matter is generally blended with it, and it may be green, or brown, or so dark- coloured as to be almost black. The quantity of fluid vf course varies. In dissection, I have some- times found the cyst to be so small as to contain

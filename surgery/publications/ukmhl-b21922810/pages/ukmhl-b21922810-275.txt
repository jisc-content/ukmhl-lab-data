TIC DOULOUREUX, OR FACIAL NEURALGIA. 259 There are many cases in which you cannot trace the tic douloureux to its real source. There is something or another, somewhere or another, in the system, which acts as a source of irritation to the nerves of the face; but where that something is, and what it is, we cannot discover. Indeed, gene- rally speaking, I should say that to trace local nervous affections to their origin is one of the greatest difficulties that we meet with in the prac- tice of our art. The disease may be in one part of the body, and the pain or spasm which it pro- duces may be in another. I have known a patient have neuralgia of the foot, which depended on a stricture of the urethra, and which, whenever it occurred, was invariably relieved by-the use of a bougie. I have known another patient have neuralgia of the foot depending on internal piles, which came on when the piles were protruded through the anus, and went away when they were reduced. I have known a spasmodic wry neck, or a nervous pain in the back, to alternate with insanity. If it were worth while to do so, I might mention other cases illustrative of this observation, that the disease may be in one part of the body, and, from some nervous connexion, it may produce pain in some other part of the body. We cannot explain the matter much further than this. I may, how- ever, venture to make this additional observation —namely, that there is good reason to believe that the seat of those nervous communications on which such sympathies depend is for the most part not in the nerves themselves, but in a higher place— in the brain, or in the spinal cord.

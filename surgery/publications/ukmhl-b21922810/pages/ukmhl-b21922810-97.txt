This L positively assert, after having made it the subject of a very careful investigation. If others have held a different opinion, it is because they have confounded those feeble and irregular contractions of the heart, which may last for a long time, but which mean nothing, with those regular and powerful move- ments which are necessary to propel the blood through the system.

But Bichat distinctly states that it has no influence whatever over the involuntary muscles ; and without ventur- ing either absolutely to confirm, or absolutely to deny this assertion, I am bound to say, after having made many experiments on the subject, that when the mode of death is that to which the G

DEATH FROM DROWNING. 89 The question has been much agitated, For how long a period may an animal remain under water, without haying the opportunity of rising to the surface, and yet be taken out alive, or in such a state as to admit of recovery ? The fact is, that there is here no exception to the ordinary rule as to suffocation. A young animal may not die so soon as an old one. A strong and healthy animal may survive during a longer period than one that is in a state of exhaustion or debility. But in all cases, as I have already stated, the cir- culation ceases within four or five minutes from the moment of the last inspiration*, and there is reason to believe that the period, in many in- stances, is even shorter than this. In my experi- ments I have found the action of the heart to be generally more feeble in animals which are drowned than in those which are strangled; and I know not to what this difference can be attributed, unless it be the additional shock which the former species of death occasions to the nervous system, in con- sequence of the immersion of the animal in a cold medium which rapidly carries off the animal heat. But it may be inquired, How are these observa- tions to be reconciled with the ordinary histories * Mr. Woolley, the intelligent and zealous surgical attendant at the Receiving House of the Royal Humane Society in Hyde Park, believes that very few lives are preserved after four minutes of complete submersion. In the year 1840, however, he met with a case in which a person recovered, although there was reason to believe that he had been five minutes under water; and a similar instance has since come under his obser- vation. See a very interesting report by this gentleman in the account of the proceedings of the Humane Society for 1840.

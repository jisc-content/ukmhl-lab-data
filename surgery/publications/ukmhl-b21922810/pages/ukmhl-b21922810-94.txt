78 EFFECTS OF STRANGULATION. quantity of dissection which is required for the exposure of the trachea in the former case, and the greater liability to haemorrhage in the latter. However, in the cases of strangulation which are now under our consideration, where the cause of the strangulation can be removed, it is not only not necessary to introduce a tube into the trachea, but it is a great deal better not to do so. A tube introduced into one nostril will answer every pur- pose, and this method possesses one very great advantage, that it is attended with no delay. A short ivory tube, of the size of the anterior aperture of the nostril, and with a projecting rim, to prevent it slipping in beyond your reach, is very convenient for the purpose; but this may not be at hand; and you will find a large elastic gum catheter; a piece of card rolled into a cylinder; or the nozzle of a pair of bellows, to answer the purpose well enough, and at all events any one of these may be used until you are provided with a better apparatus. In smaller animals, there is no more convenient machine for impelling air into the lungs than an elastic gum bottle. But the gum bottles commonly in use are not sufficiently capacious to be used in the human subject, and nothing can be more con- venient than a pair of bellows. Bellows made expressly for the purpose should, when fully ex- panded, contain from fifty to sixty cubic inches of air, and should have a flexible tube adapted to the short ivory tube which is fitted to the nostril. But on most occasions you must make shift with any bellows that you can obtain at the moment,

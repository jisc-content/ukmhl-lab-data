They do not seem to be of any service until the inflammation on the surface of the skin has in some degree per- vaded the substance of the breast itself; and hence I am led to suspect that they ow7e their efficacy to a new action being excited in the membrane of the cyst. My experience of what happens in cases of encysted hydrocele has led me to hesi- tate as to the injection of stimulants into the cyst, or the employment of any other very active means of exciting inflammation of it; and, indeed, such a mode of treatment seems scarcely to be called for, as no small degree of inflammation sometimes follows the application of the stimulants externally. A lady had one of these tumors rather deeply seated in the breast. I punctured it with a grooved needle, and a considerable quantity of serum escaped.

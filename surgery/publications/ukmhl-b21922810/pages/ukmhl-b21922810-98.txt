82 EFFECTS OF STRANGULATION. name of asphyxia has been commonly but (accord- ing to its etymology) most absurdly and improperly applied, the application of electricity in any form to the heart is altogether useless. Nor is this con- clusion at all different from that which a priori we might have expected. When the order of the phenomena in a dying animal is such as I have just described, there is nothing in the circulation of the dark-coloured blood which can renew the failing powers, either of the muscular fibres of the heart, or those of the nervous system. The case is entirely different from that of death from syncope, where the action of the heart ceases at the same time with that of the muscles of respiration, or probably sooner. Here the animal dies having the left auricle and ventricle distended with scarlet blood. The heart is quiescent; but neither has its irritability become exhausted, nor has the nervous system been nar- cotised, by the circulation of blood of a different quality. It is no matter of wonder that under these circumstances the heart should be able to resume its functions, and perform them with as much energy as before ; and that it may do so, even when syncope has been produced by the introduc- tion of the infusion of tobacco into the intestinal canal, is sufficiently proved by an experiment of which you will find an account in my first series of observations on the effects of poisons in the animal system.* * Philosophical Transactions, 1811.

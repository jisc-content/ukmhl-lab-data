313 MORTIFICATION. I now speak of a sudden injury operating for a short space of time, such as a contusion or a wound. The effect of mechanical injury may be to pro- duce mortification, which is confined to the parts actually injured. For instance, a man gets a kick on the shin, and the next day there is a slough of the skin where the injury was inflicted. The kick has squeezed the skin against the bone, ruptured the capillary vessels, and destroyed the organization in the part, so that the circula- tion could not go on. But here the mortification is confined to the part actually injured. A remarkable circumstance happens in some of these cases. The cellular membrane has not so much vitality as the skin ; and, therefore, perishes more easily. A blow will disorganize the cellular mem- brane which will not disorganize the skin. A man came into the hospital who had had a severe blow on the instep. There was a purple appearance, but no very extensive ecchymosis; and I thought nothing of it. The next day I found the part inflamed; the following day there was a good deal of swelling; and on the third day the skin was beginning to slough. I divided the skin with a lancet, and found a large slough of the cellular membrane. The blow had pressed the skin and the cellular membrane against the bones of the instep, and had killed the cellular membrane, but not the skin. The slough of the cellular membrane would have been followed by an extensive slough- ing of the skin, if, acting on the principle explained in my last lecture, I had not divided the latter freely. In cases in which you suspect that the

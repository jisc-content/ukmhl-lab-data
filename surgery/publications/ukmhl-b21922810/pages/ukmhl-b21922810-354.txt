338 MORTIFICATION. the mouth, and to the inside of the female urethra. In that disease which we call epulis, a red tumor, that looks like the gum, and which becomes con- nected with it (though I believe that it really has its origin in one of the alveoli), you may use them with great advantage. It is in vain to destroy the outer part of such a tumor, that is, the part connected with the gum, unless you also destroy the inner part, where it originates in the alveolar process, also; and, from the surgeon not being aware of this circumstance, I have, in several instances, known repeated operations with the knife, as well as the application of the hot iron and caustics, fail. The caustic which I find in general to be most convenient in these particular cases is the potassa fusa. You must fix it at a right angle to the end of a pair of dressing forceps, and secure it well by tying thread round it. The caustic should be scraped small enough to enter the alveolus, the tooth having been previously extracted. Having thus destroyed the disease where it originated, you may afterwards apply the caustic to the other portion which is connected with the gum. But you will say, that it will burn the tongue or the cheek; and so it will, if you are not careful. You must let your assistant hold open the cheek ; and while you apply the caustic, he must have at hand a brush, dipped in diluted vinegar, which he is to apply wherever the caustic spreads further than you intend it. I do not re- commend this kind of treatment in the case of a large epulis, in which it will probably be neces- sary to take out a portion of the jaw ; but it is

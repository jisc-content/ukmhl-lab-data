MEDICAL STUDENTS AND PRACTITIONERS. 39 d 4 three-fourths of your knowledge will die with you; and then others will run the same course. Our sciences are, indeed, progressive; but how much more rapid would their progress be, if all the know- ledge that experience gives could be preserved. Now, these remarks are of practical importance to you all. You should begin to act upon them at an early period of your studies. Make out every thing relating to the structure of the body for yourselves. Do not altogether trust to what is told you in lectures and books, but make the knowledge your own by your own labours. Ob- serve for yourselves the phenomena of disease, and the only way of doing this in an efficient manner is to take your own written notes of cases: (I say, your own notes, for copying those taken by others, as far as the improvement of your own minds goes, is nearly useless) and when you have taken notes in the morning, write them out in the evening, and think of them, and compare them with one another, and converse on them with your fellow-students, and all this will render the investigation of disease a comparatively easy matter afterwards. In these latter observations, I have anticipated some of those which I had intended to address especially to those among you who are on the point of offering themselves to the public as can- didates for practice. It would be a fatal error for you to suppose that you have obtained the whole, or even any large portion of the knowledge which it is necessary for you to possess. You have not done much more than learn the way of learning. The most important part of your education remains;

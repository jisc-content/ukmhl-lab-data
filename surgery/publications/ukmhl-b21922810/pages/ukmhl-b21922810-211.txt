WHICH REQUIRE AN OPERATION. 195 of future disease. The colour of the gland of the breast is very little different from that of the sur- rounding adeps ; and the blood that flows adds to the difficulty of distinguishing between them. To avoid this error, you must be careful in the dissection to keep the knife near the skin, not near the breast; and, further than this, in every case when you have removed the breast, you should look at its surface, and see that it is every where covered by healthy adeps. If it be not, then examine the inside of the flap of the skin, and see whether any small portion of the breast has been allowed to remain there. So far, I say, the success of the operation may depend mainly on yourselves; but now let us consider what are the circumstances, independently of any thing that you do, that may lead you to think there is no chance of the operation leading to an ultimate cure: and what are the circum- stances that would lead you to hope that the result may be more favourable ? You may divide scirrhous tumors of the breast into two classes : one where there is a conver- sion of the gland of the breast itself into the scirrhous structure, there being no well-defined margin to it; the other, where there is a scirrhous tumor imbedded in what appears to be otherwise a healthy breast, as if it were altogether a new growth, there being a well-defined boundary to it. In the first order of cases, where the tumor has no distinct boundary, and where there is a conver- sion of the gland of the breast into the diseased structure, the operation not only never succeeds o 2

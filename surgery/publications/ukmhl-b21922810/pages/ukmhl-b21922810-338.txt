322 MORTIFICATION. red oxide of mercury, of each two drachms, the bichloride of mercury one drachm, with as much hog’s lard as is necessary to blend them together. This may be spread on lint, and one or two applications will be sufficient to destroy a very large mass of fungous granulations. One mode of making an issue is by means of caustic; and for this purpose we generally employ the caustic potash (potassa fusa), or strong nitric acid. The former may be rubbed on the part until it has penetrated through the skin, and that is enough. If you continue rubbing it afterwards it penetrates deeper than is necessary, and probably gives rise to considerable bleeding. This caustic continues to spread after you have ceased to apply it; and you must make an allowance for this when you use it, otherwise you will make too large a slough. The caustic potash may be used in other ways ; it may be made into a paste with an equal quantity of soap, spread on some linen rag, laid on the part and allowed to remain there for an hour, or longer; or a paste may be composed of two parts of the caustic potash and one part of lime, rubbed down with some alcohol, and applied in the same manner. This last has ob- tained some celebrity under the name of the “ Caustic of Vienna.” The effects of the nitric acid extend a little after it has been applied, but not so much as those of the caustic potash. It may be applied by means of lint on the end of a probe dipped in the acid, and rubbed for several minutes on the surface. I have seen issues made by the nitrate of silver made into an ointment and laid

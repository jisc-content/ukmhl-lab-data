ULCERS OF THE LEGS. 167 skin, and in the other from that of the inflamed cellular membrane; and these inflammations are analogous to what we meet with in other cases of venous congestion. But in some instances you find inflammation taking place of a different kind, in the cellular membrane, immediately surrounding the varicose cluster. The cellular membrane becomes infil- trated with coagulated lymph, so that the vari- cose cluster is, as it were, imbedded in a mass of solid substance. At first you would suppose that these veins are obliterated, but they are not so. The lymph which has been deposited becomes organized, and the coats of the vessels are thickened, but they remain pervious nevertheless, containing fluid blood, which may be perceived with the finger flowing freely through the gristly mass. Where there is this deposit of lymph in the cellular membrane round the vein, the skin becomes inflamed near it, and this may give rise to a troublesome ulcer. The more usual history of a varicose ulcer, however, is as follows : The skin is distended at some point, and a scab forms upon it. When the scab comes off,. there is an ulcer, and the ulcer spreads. The varicose ulcer, in most instances, begins about the inner ankle ; but it may occur, as in the patient whose case is now before us, in other parts of the leg. Varicose ulcers, in most cases, have a well-marked character, for which, however, you are not at this time to look in this patient, who has been confined to her bed for nearly a week.

THE STUDIES REQUIRED FOR 16 of the brain are, as you must already know, highly dangerous, so that there is only a small proportion of recoveries among a great number of deaths from these accidents. I was once at the trouble of looking over all the cases of this kind which I could find recorded among my own manu- script notes, and in what might be regarded as standard books belonging to this part of surgery. I constructed a table, which represented, in every case, the kind of wound, the treatment employed by the surgeon as far as operations were con- cerned, and the results which followed; and it was curious to observe how large a proportion of the recoveries occurred in those cases in which the surgeon either avoided an operation altogether, or confined himself to the removal of some loose and detached pieces of bone. You may well suppose that a person who has a musket-ball lodged in the brain is in a very dangerous condition; never- theless, it appears that it is safer to allow it to remain, than to endeavour to extract it. I feel it my duty to give you these cautions. I should, however, be sorry if, in so doing, I were to lead you to over-estimate what nature can do, or to under-estimate the resources of our art. No one will probably be bold enough to tell you that surgery is useless ; and none but the ignorant will hold this language respecting the sister art of medicine. You will not have been engaged for two months in visiting the bedsides of the patients in the hospital, without having ample means of contradicting this absurdity. I said that it is easy to interfere too much in the management of a case

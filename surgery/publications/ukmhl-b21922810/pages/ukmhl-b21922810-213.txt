WHICIT REQUIRE AN OPERATION. 197 o 3 does not matter how small an extent of skin appears to be thus contaminated ; if any portion of it be in this state, the seeds of the disease are in the skin in the neighbourhood, and the knife divides what is apparently healthy but what is not healthy in reality. A scirrhous tumor of the breast not unfrequently causes a contraction of the lactiferous tubes which pass from the various parts of the breast to the nipple; and this contraction necessarily causes a drawing in or retraction of the nipple. The retrac- tion of the nipple is to be regarded as an unfavour- able symptom. There is danger of the disease having extended from the nipple to the skin in the neighbourhood ; and an operation ought not to be had recourse to, until by a careful examination it has been ascertained that the skin does not appear to be otherwise than in a healthy state. In many cases of scirrhous tumors of the breast, the skin is drawn, or tucked, in, over the tumor, so as to produce the appearance of a dimple in it. Where this dimple in the skin exists you may be almost sure that there is a scirrhous tumor in the breast beneath it, and on examination you will feel it with the finger. I believe this dimple of the skin to form a very great objection to the operation, and that, under these circumstances, there is little or no chance of it leading to a permanent cure. But on what does this appearance depend ? In a case which I dissected very carefully I found a narrow process or elongation of the disease, perhaps half an inch in length, passing from the tumor through the adeps into the skin, and con-

APPARENTLY CONNECTED WITH THE LIVER. 109 brane of the spermatic chord. Here, as where the cyst is connected with the liver, although the fluid is generally very small in quantity, in a few cases it may amount to one or two pints, or even more. I was consulted concerning a little boy about six years of age who had been supposed to labour under a disease of the vertebrae. The only symptom, however, was a tumor over the posterior part of the ribs, on one side of the spine, of the size of a small orange, but of an oval shape. The mother said that she knew not how long the tumor had existed, as she had not noticed it until it had attained a considerable size, but there was no reason to believe that it was congenital. It evidently contained fluid, but had none of the usual characters of the spina bifida, and had very much the appearance of an abscess. On making a puncture, however, with a grooved needle, I drew off about six drachms of a clear, colourless, watery fluid, which was not the whole of what would probably have been drawn off if I had used a small trocar. The case to which I referred in the beginning of my lecture, presents some circumstances of greater interest than those which I had met with previously. I shall read the notes of it contained in my case-book. “ Harriet Copeland, nine years of age, was “ admitted into St. George’s Hospital on the 9th “ of March 1834, with a firm elastic tumor in the “ left hypochondriac region, pushing forward the “ integuments, and extending backwards, beneath “ the lower ribs, to the left side of the spine.

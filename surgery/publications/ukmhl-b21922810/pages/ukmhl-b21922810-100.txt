84 DEATH FROM DROWNING. LECTURE IV. ON THE MODE OF DEATH FROM DROWNING. Animals that are intended to respire the air which is dissolved in the water by means of gills are generally capable, within certain limits, of respiring the air of the atmosphere, and there are some fish in which life may be thus maintained for a con- siderable time after they have been removed from their natural element. Mr. Clift has furnished me with the following observations made by him on the Lamprey. Under certain circumstances he may be seen attached to a stone above the level of the water, closely adhering to it by means of the powerful muscles of the mouth, which produce a vacuum with all the force of a piston. He inhales the air through a tube, which may be regarded as having some analogy to the trachea, and which communicates with the cavities that contain the gills ; and the air received in this manner passes out through the seven orifices which are placed on each side of the thorax, ascending from thence in bubbles to the surface of the water. In this manner he may be observed to continue to breathe for many successive hours. Dr. John Davy has informed me of some inte- resting observations, which he has made on another fish; the Benito (the Scomber pelamis of Linnaeus).

MORTIFICATION. 344 extent, the constitution is affected in proportion to the quantity of parts destroyed. This, how- ever, is remarkable : that where, on the surface of the body, there is an absolute destruction of the skin by intense heat, the constitution often suffers, in the first instance, much less than if a slighter degree of heat had been applied to the same extent of surface. You will have frequent opportunities of verifying this observation, if you watch the comparative effects of burns and scalds in the cases admitted into the hospital. I have been surprised sometimes to find, where a great deal of skin has been completely destroyed, how little the constitution has resented the injury imme- diately after it had been inflicted. But it resents it enough afterwards ; and when the period arrives at which the slough should be thrown off, then the general system suffers. I remember a lady who had both her arms burned, so that nearly the whole skin of each upper extremity was completely dead ; yet her constitution, in the first instance, seemed almost unconscious of the shock ; as soon, how- ever, as the line of separation at the margin of the dead skin had begun to show itself, a change took place, and she died in a day or two. The actual cautery may be used for surgical purposes on the same principle as caustics ; and there is one occasion on which the former will certainly do what the latter will not effectually accomplish; I allude to haemorrhage. In some cases of haemorrhage from a great number of small vessels, or from large vessels, which cannot be secured on account of their being deeply

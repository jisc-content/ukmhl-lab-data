155 OF THE FEMALE BREAST. transparent watery fluid, without coagulable matter, is occasionally found in the breast, which may be comp&red to the membranous cysts, containing pure water, which are sometimes met with in con- nexion with the liver (of which I have given an account elsewhere), and to the encysted hydro- cele of the spermatic cord or testicle. This disease is probably rare, as only two examples of it have fallen under my observation. In one of them the cyst was extracted by an operation ; in the other, the nature of the fluid having been ascertained by means of a puncture with a grooved needle, the tumor afterwards disappeared under the use of a stimulating embrocation. Secondly : A cavity is sometimes formed in the breast, containing one or more genuine hydatids. Here there is a single fluctuating tumor, which gradually increases to a large size. If it be freely opened, the hydatids escape, and the cavity in which they were lodged becomes an abscess, which slowly contracts and heals. Thirdly : In a more advanced stage of the disease, it is not unfrequently mistaken for car- cinoma ; and I have no doubt that a large pro- portion of the cases in which it has been supposed that an operation has effected a permanent cure of the last-mentioned disease, have been in reality of this description. The disease which I have been now describing is undoubtedly not malignant, in the proper acceptation of the term. It may go on to inflam- mation and ulceration, and the ulcer may spread and slough and bleed, but it does not contaminate

OF THE FEMALE BREAST. 149 l 3 that a similar growth of fibrinous substance may take place from the external surface of the cysts, connecting different cysts with each other; but this point also may, perhaps, require to be illus- trated by further investigations. Fourthly: Under certain circumstances the cysts become completely filled up by the morbid growths, so that their cavities are obliterated, the tumor being thus converted into a solid mass, in which, however, the remains of the cysts are per- ceptible ; and this is the prelude to a still further change, in which the greater part of the cysts have wholly disappeared, a solid mass of an indistinctly laminated texture occupying their place. Fifthly: If one of the membranous cysts be artificially laid open, or if it burst from over- distension with serum, the fibrinous excrescence from its inner surface being no longer restrained by the pressure of the skin, increases in size, and protrudes externally in the form of a fungus, giving to the tumor a new and more formidable character. In this last stage of the disease, it is evident that spreading ulceration, sloughing, and hae- morrhage, the usual results of an ulcer occurring in a diseased structure, must ensue, for which our art furnishes no other means of cure than the removal of the affected parts by a surgical operation. And this leads us to the concluding and most important part of these inquiries. In considering the treatment of these cases, it is convenient to distinguish those in which the

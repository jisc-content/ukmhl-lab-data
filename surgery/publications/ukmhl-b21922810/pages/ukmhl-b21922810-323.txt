I drew the double ligature as tight as I could; and when I saw the patient half an hour after- wards, the piece of the tongue thus strangu- lated was quite livid, and apparently dead. I saw him again in three or four hours, and found him suffering a great deal of pain and incon- venience. It occurred to me that the piece of the tongue had been dead for some time, and that there could be no objection to my giving him relief by cutting off the ligature. With some little trouble I succeeded, but, to my great annoyance, the next day I found the whole piece, which had appeared to be dead, to be still living. The ligature, therefore, in surgical operations, must not only be very tightly drawn, but left on until it is separated by a natural process. Mortification from Pressure. Parts may be killed by a continued pressure. The mode of death here is nearly the same as when they are killed by ligature, the difference being simply this : the pressure is like a ligature applied to a broad surface, operating not merely on the principal vessels, but also on all the small vessels and capillaries. Mortification from pressure is chiefly observable when the pressure is made on parts which lie over a bone; where there is no cushion of flesh between the latter and the skin. If the pressure be very great, it may produce mortification immediately. I remember that when I was a student, a man came into the hospital with a fracture of the leg. The surgeon applied

DEATH FROM DROWNING. 86 which can be received into the lungs ; and a spasm of the muscles seems to prevent the admission of water in any considerable quantity into the trachea. The attempts to breathe are repeated several times ; and after each attempt a small quantity of air is expelled from the mouth and nostrils, until the air-cells of the lungs are almost completely emptied. Then the animal becomes insensible, and convulsive actions of the muscles mark the instant when the brain begins to suffer from the influx of the dark-coloured blood. After these convulsions the animal is motionless, and gives no signs of life ; but if the hand be applied to the thorax the pulsation of the heart, gradually becom- ing fainter and fainter, indicates that some remains of vitality still linger in the system. Before the circulation ceases altogether, the muscles of respira- tion resume their action, and some ineffectual efforts are again made to breathe. It is a remark- able circumstance that the diaphragm continues to exert itself nearly as long as the heart itself, so that the interval between the cessation of the attempts to breathe and the cessation of the motions of the heart, short as it is in animals that die of strangulation, is shorter still in those that perish from drowning. These phenomena follow each other in rapid succession, and the whole scene is closed, and the living animal is converted into a lifeless corpse, in the brief space of a few minutes. I have never opened the thorax of an animal in which the heart was found acting in such a manner as to maintain the circulation of the blood so long as five minutes after complete submersion; and from the information which I

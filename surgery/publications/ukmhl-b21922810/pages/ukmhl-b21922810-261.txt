245 IN CASES OF SYPHILIS. and I have applied the roller, thus prepared, not very tight, round the knee ; repeating the applica- tion daily. The motions of the child produce the necessary friction ; and the cuticle being thin the mercury easily enters the system. This causes neither griping nor purging ; in a child it does not even in general cause soreness of the gums ; but it cures the disease. Very few of those children ultimately recover in whom the mercury has been given internally ; but I have not seen a single case in which this other method of treatment has failed. Mercurial inunction may be employed in certain cases in which mercury taken internally would absolutely do the greatest harm. For example : a gentleman had a phagedenic sore upon the penis. It could not be said that he was in ill-health before, and therefore there was reason to believe that the disease was spreading merely from the intensity of the venereal poison. He took calomel and opium ; the gums became tender; but the sore became worse than before, spreading more rapidly, until the greater part of the glans was destroyed. The ulceration showed no disposition to stop; resisting all modes of treatment; until, at last, he was put on a course of mercurial inunction. Then the progress of the ulceration was at once arrested, and the sore healed as fast as possible. I have seen several cases of the same kind.

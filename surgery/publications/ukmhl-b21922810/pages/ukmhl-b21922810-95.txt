79 EFFECTS OF STRANGULATION. and must probably be content to insert the nozzle itself into the nostril. Even these may not be to be had at once, and you must then be content, in the first instance, to inflate the lungs by your own breath, or by that of another person, with the aid of a gum tube, or any other tube that can be procured. During the process of inflating the lungs, the upper part of the patientâ€™s person should be exposed, and the operator will then know, by observing a gentle elevation of the chest and abdomen, that the lungs are sufficiently inflated. As I have already stated, the number of inflations in a minute should not exceed that of ordinary inspiration, and care should be taken not forcibly to distend the lungs, lest a portion of the air should be forced into the ramifications of the pulmonary vessels. But it is needless to give directions as to the exact admeasurement of the air. However good this may be in theory it is practically impossible. A portion of the air escapes by the other nostril and the mouth, and these apertures must not be closed, as they form a safety-valve, which will do more towards pre- venting the over-distension of the lungs than the most ingenious apparatus. Still something must be left to the prudence of the operator, especially if the bellows be of a large size; and he must bear in mind that the quantity of air which is required at each artificial inspiration is not only not greater, but that it may even be less than in natural breathing. There is only one further pre- caution necessary; an assistant should press the

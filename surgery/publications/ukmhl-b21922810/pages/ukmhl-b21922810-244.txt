228 CORNS AND BUNIONS. that I had succeeded ; but I have not heard of her since. A tumor is occasionally formed on the instep, which, although neither a corn nor a bunion, bears a near relation to them. It is met with in young men who wear tight boots, and the usual situation of it is near the articulation between the internal cuneiform bone and the metatarsal bone of the great toe. The tumor is under the skin, hard and immovable, so that it seems to a superficial observer to be an enlargement of the bone itself. The skin over it is in a natural state, except in cases of long standing, in which the cuticle be- comes somewhat thickened. I have had no oppor- tunity of dissecting the parts affected with this disease, and am uncertain as to the exact texture in which the deposit takes place. A tumor of this kind is productive of as much inconvenience to the patient as a corn, and requires the same treatment. He should for a time leave off boots altogether ; or, if he cannot well do this, the boot-maker should be directed to procure a last with a projection in that part of it which corresponds to the situation of the tumor, so that the boot may not make any pressure on it.

But the cure of course will not be permanent if he continues to wear tight boots afterwards. I have several times seen a tumor, similar to

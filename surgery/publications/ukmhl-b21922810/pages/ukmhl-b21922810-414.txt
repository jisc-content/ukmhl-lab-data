CHRONIC ABSCESS OF THE TIBIA. 398 thickened. There was a new deposit of bone under the periosteum, softer than the bone of original formation. This operation, as in other cases of chronic periostitis, relieved the tension and the pain, and the patient was supposed to be cured. However, about a year afterwards, in August 1827, there was a recurrence of the pain; the enlargement of the tibia, which at first had in some degree subsided, had returned, and it con- tinued to increase, in the enlarged tibia there was one spot a little below the knee, where there was exceeding tenderness on pressure. I need not describe the symptoms more particularly; it is sufficient to say, that they bore a very close resemblance to those in the last case ; the only difference being, that as the disease had been of shorter duration, the pain was less severe, and that the tibia was affected in the upper instead of the lower extremity. I concluded that there must be an abscess in the centre of the bone, and ap- plied the trephine to the tender spot. I used the common trephine made for injuries of the head, which, having a projecting rim or shoulder, would penetrate only to a certain depth. However, it enabled me to remove a piece of bone of sufficient thickness to expose the cancellous structure. Then with a chisel I removed some more of the bone. Presently there was a flow of pus in such quantity as completely to fill the opening made by the trephine and the chisel. It seemed as if the bone had been, to a certain extent, kept in a state of tension by the abscess, and that, as soon as an opening was made into it, it contracted and forced

306 MORTIFICATION. as well as of the venous blood, and the piles die directly. This is the way in which a ligature should be applied in almost all cases in which you have recourse to it as a means of cure; it should be drawn as tight as possible. In dealing with piles, or nasvi, or tumors of the tongue, the strangulation made by the ligature should be com- plete, otherwise not only are the sufferings of the patient aggravated, but it may happen that severe constitutional disturbance will ensue. I have said that when you apply a ligature in a surgical operation, your object should be to stop the flow of arterial blood at once; and you might suppose that if the ligature were kept on for half an hour, or an hour, that this would be sufficient; that the part being deprived of the flow of arterial blood for such a time it would certainly lose its vitality. But this is not exactly the case. You apply a ligature round an artery, draw it as tight as is possible ; it divides the middle and inner coats, but only compresses the outer coat. It makes a slough of a little piece of the latter; and when the ligature comes away at the end of ten days or a fortnight, you find the slough in it. But if you cut off the ligature in half an hour, or an hour,—an experiment which has frequently been made,—there is no slough. The artery may be obliterated, or it may not, by the effusion of lymph; but the piece of the outer coat that was included in the ligature recovers itself; at least we do not find that it comes away as a slough. I had a patient with a malignant tumor of the tongue, which, according to the method suggested by Sir

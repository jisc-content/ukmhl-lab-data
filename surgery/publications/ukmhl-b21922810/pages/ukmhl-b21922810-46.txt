30 THE DUTIES AND CONDUCT OF older than yourselves, will have occupied their places ; and the tribunal, by which you will be judged of hereafter, will be composed of a different order of individuals from those to whose favourable opinion you would be most anxious to appeal at the present moment. But I should be sorry if I were misunderstood as representing this to be the only, or the principal motive, which should lead you to avail yourselves to the utmost of your present opportunities. The knowledge which you will obtain as students is to be the foundation of the whole of that which many years of professional practice will afford you afterwards; and, if the foundation be insecure, the superstructure will be of little value. However imperfect may be the sciences belonging to the healing art, to bring them even to their present state has been the work of centuries. The indus- trious student may enter on the active pursuit of his profession with a scanty store of knowledge compared with that of which he will find himself possessed twenty years afterwards; but he is in the direct road to greater knowledge. He has the advantages of principles which have been established by the labours of many preceding generations ; and this will render the subsequent efforts of his life comparatively easy. But he, who has neglected his education, must, as it were, begin anew; and he will find, when it is too late, that no combination of energy and talent will enable him to rise to the level of those, who were, in the beginning, his more diligent competitors. He will, moreover, labour under another and still greater disadvantage.

MORTIFICATION. 362 observe, that it exists in very different degrees in different cases. Sometimes the pains are slight, and at other times very severe. There may be pain in the toes, or pain in the heel, without any other manifestation of disease. The pain becomes ex- cruciating, and it never ceases. The disease is called neuralgia, which means nothing. No remedy gives any relief, unless it be large doses of opium ; and at the end of six or twelve months mortification of the foot takes place. I have already observed that what seems to be an acci- dental attack of inflammation is often the imme- diate forerunner of the mortification. A very frequent occurrence is this. A patient cuts a corn; the knife penetrates too deep, and causes the toe to bleed, and a little inflam- mation follows; or, it may be that the foot is chilled by exposure to cold, and the patient goes to the fire to warm it, and that this is followed by a degree of inflammation, which, if the arteries were healthy, would be a chilblain and nothing more, but which, in their present condition, lays the foundation of mortification.

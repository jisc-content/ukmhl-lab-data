THE MEDICAL PROFESSION. 11 with the morbid appearances observed afterwards. The more extended cultivation of morbid anatomy is one of the most peculiar features of modern times. It has laid the foundation of a more accurate system of pathology than that which existed for- merly, and has led to many improvements in practice; and it is right that your minds should be impressed with a just sense of its great value and importance. Having said thus much, I trust that I shall not be considered as under-estimating these researches in the observations which follow. Morbid anatomy is not pathology, though it is an essential part of it. You may know all that is to be known of the former, and yet your knowledge of the latter may be very limited. To be a pathologist you must study disease in the living body even more than in the dead. Even in the instance of what we call local diseases, morbid anatomy does not teach us all that we ought to know; but there are many diseases which, as far as we can see, have no abso- lute locality ; and what does it teach us there ? In cases of hysteria, gout, fever, and in a number of others which it would be easy to enumerate, the dissection of the dead body furnishes us with little else than negative information ; and in some cases, if we trust implicitly to it, morbid anatomy will prove a deceitful guide. Thus, in a patient who has died of continued fever, you find the mucous membrane and glands of the lower portion of the small intestine ulcerated. Your first impression might be that you had discovered the original malady of which the fever was symptomatic. It is

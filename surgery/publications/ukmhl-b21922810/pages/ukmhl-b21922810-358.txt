The destruction of them to a greater depth than this is unnecessary. This method of treatment was recommended some years ago by Mr. Welbank, who wrote a very interesting paper on the subject. I have taken this opportunity of speaking of some of the principal cases in surgery to which the destruction of parts by caustic is applicable. But you will find a great number of others

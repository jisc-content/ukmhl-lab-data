OF THE FEMALE BREAST. 145 matter, and one of them might, on the first view of it, be almost mistaken for medullary disease. The tumor which is displayed in the next pre- paration illustrates a still more advanced stage of the disease. I removed it from the breast of a private patient in the month of November 1836. It had existed for many years; gradually, but slowly, increasing in size. You may perceive that at the time of its removal the tumor was not larger than a small orange, and that it was of an irre- gular shape. Near the base of the nipple is a membranous cyst, which contained two or three drachms of very dark-coloured serum. Some smaller cysts, which also contained serum, are seen in the neighbourhood ; and a bristle introduced at one of the ducts of the nipple has entered one of the cysts by a smaller circular aperture. The tumor, on a superficial view of it, appears to be one uniform mass of solid substance ; but on a more close inspection you find it to consist of a congeries of membranous cysts, the cavities of which are completely filled with fibrinous matter. In many of the cysts, on examination with a probe, I found this fibrinous matter to have an attachment to one part of the inner surface, lying in contact with the lining membrane elsewhere, but having no actual adhesion to it.* * As I was on the point of revising this lecture for republi- cation (September 1845), this patient again consulted me on account of a small tumor which had shown itself in the neigh- bourhood of that which I had removed formerly. I advised her to have it removed, and (as I was on the point of leaving London for a time) to place herself for that purpose under the care of another surgeon. She accordingly applied to Mr. Aston L

323 MORTIFICATION. upon the part. It makes a slough of the skin, and, as far as the mere issue is concerned, will do very well; but it is very slow in its action, and causes ten times the pain produced by the other caustics. When an issue is open you want to keep it open, while perhaps it has a tendency to heal. Then there are occasions on which something is required to prevent sores, or the orifice of a sinus, from healing. A man may have a small sinus by the side of the anus. If the orifice heal the matter collects within, and the result is the forma- tion of a fresh abscess. In either of these cases, the best thing that can be done is to touch the margin of the issue, or the surface of the sore, or the orifice of the sinus, now and then with the caustic potash. It makes a slough which takes some time to sepa- rate, and the application of it once in ten days or a fortnight will answer the intended purpose. I have often known the nitrate of silver to be used with the same intention, but in fact it promotes cicatrization, and heals the sore or the sinus, instead of keeping it open. There is an occasion on which you will not unfrequently have occasion to apply caustic, and where it is very material indeed that it should be done in a careful and scientific manner. I refer to cases in which a person has been bitten by a rabid dog, or a dog supposed to be rabid. On these occasions it is generally better to excise the part thoroughly, and to take out a good deal of the surrounding parts. But it sometimes happens that this cannot be very easily accom- plished. A person, for instance, is bitten in the y 2

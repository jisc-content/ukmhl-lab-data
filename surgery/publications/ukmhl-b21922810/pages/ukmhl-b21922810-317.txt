MORTIFICATION. 301 membrane. Simple acupunctures are generally sufficient for this purpose, provided that they are made at an early period, and repeated once or twice daily for several successive days. Where a suffi- cient quantity of the serum does not escape by the punctures, or sloughs of the cellular membrane have already begun to form, larger openings are required, and incisions must be made, through the scalp and the subjacent textures, quite down to the cranium. These must be repeated from time to time, as the disease extends from one part of the scalp to another. The appearances observed, when these incisions are made, explain, in some degree, the seat and nature of the disease. There is a slight effusion of serum immediately under- neath the scalp; but the great effusion, and that on which the tumefaction chiefly depends, is underneath the tendon of the occipito-frontalis muscle; and here the effusion is in some instances so extensive, that I have known the tendon to be separated as much as half an inch, or even more, from the pericranium. A large quantity of serum escapes immediately on the incision being made; the tension is of course relieved, and the destruc- tion of the parts is prevented. I suspect this disease to be a modification of erysipelas. The symptoms are nearly similar, except that there is no redness of the skin, which, indeed, usually appears to be paler than usual. In confirmation of this opinion, I may mention that in a few instances, the true erysipelatous character is ex- hibited as soon as the inflammation has extended from the scalp to the face. The disease is not

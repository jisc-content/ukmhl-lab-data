You might d priori expect that the pressure of the tumor would often produce this effect, but it is not so. 1 have, however, known inflammation to take place in the substance of the tumor, and an abscess to form in its centre. A very remarkable case of this kind was under my care in this hospital. An elderly man was admitted, with an enormous fatty tumor on his back between the shoulders, where it hung like a wallet.

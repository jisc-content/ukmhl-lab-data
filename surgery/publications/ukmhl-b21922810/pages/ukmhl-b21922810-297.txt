281 ADIPOSE TUMORS. parts is of the same kind, and they are to be re- moved in the same manner; namely, by dividing the skin, and making an incision into the sub- stance of the tumor, then turning it out with the fingers, and not in general using the knife again, except at one point, where a more complete adhesion to the neighbouring parts indicates the entrance of some small arteries. In confirmation of this view of the relationship of these two classes of tumors to each other, I may mention the following case: A lady had an enormous tumor of the breast. It did not feel very different from the natural breast, but it seemed like a breast of a monstrous size. Sir Astley Cooper saw the patient with me. There is such a disease as hypertrophy of the breast; that is, a morbid increase of the gland, without any actual alteration of structure; and both Sir Astley and myself were inclined to believe that such was the nature of the disease in this instance. The tumor continued to grow; the patient became tired of carrying it about, and we recommended her to have it re- moved. Sir Astley Cooper was present at the operation, and we set about it, believing that I should remove the whole breast.

329 MORTIFICATION. solution of the diacetate of lead. If you are afraid of nitrate of silver burning the neighbouring parts, its action may be neutralized by common olive oil. A solution of the bicarbonate of potash will decom- pose chloride of zinc ; and so with other caustics. Caustics may be used, with great advantage, in many cases for destroying the congenital vascular tumors which we see so frequently in children; naevi, as they are sometimes termed. There are small vascular spots, not exactly con- genital, though they occur in early life, which present themselves on the face of children, and which, not unfrequently, are objects of some anxiety, especially in the higher classes of society, as they form rather ugly red specks on the face. On examining one of them with a lens, you see one large vessel in the centre, and small branches radiating from it. These spots, in most instances, if let alone, will, in the course of time, disappear spontaneously. If, however, it be thought desirable not to wait for the natural cure, you may destroy them in the following manner. If the principal vessel be near the surface, touch it, through the cuticle, for an instant, with strong nitric acid, and it will contract, and become obliterated. This is best done by means of a pointed piece of glass, which they sell a^ a sort of toy, under the name of a glass pen. It is, in truth, as bad a pen as possible, but it answers this purpose, and some other pur- poses in surgery, extremely well. If the acid flow over the cheek, you may neutralize it by applying a solution of the bicarbonate of potash. But this method is not sufficient for the destruction of

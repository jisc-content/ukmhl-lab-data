58 EFFECTS OF STRANGULATION. on the jugular veins so as to interfere with the due return of blood to the heart, and cause an accu- mulation of it in the vessels of the brain. In examining the body of one person who had been hanged, I found a large extravasation of blood in the substance of the cerebrum ; and in Dr. Hooperâ€™s valuable museum of pathological anatomy there is the brain of another person who had died in the same manner, with a considerable extravasation of blood among the membranes. These are, how- ever, undoubtedly, exceptions to the general rule. Neither vascular congestion, nor sanguineous apo- plexy, is the common cause of death from strangu- lation. I passed a ligature under the trachea of a guinea pig; and having drawn it as tight as possible, I secured it with a knot at the back of the neck ; so that it included all the parts situated in the neck, with the exception of the trachea. The animal seemed uneasy, but breathed and moved about, and continued to do so after the ligature was removed at the end of a quarter of an hour from the period of its application. If the ligature were to make such pressure on the arteries which supply the brain as to prevent altogether the influx of blood into it, it is to be presumed that immediate death would be the con- sequence ; but the fact is that the vertebral arteries are out of the reach of pressure, and maintain the circulation notwithstanding the obstruction of the carotid.* * The remark is sufficiently obvious; but it may be worth while to notice the confirmation of it by an interesting experi- ment of Sir Astley Cooper. Sir Astley found that the vertebral

286 MORTIFICATION. Mortification from Inflammation. Mortification is described as one mode in which inflammation terminates. A very intense degree of inflammation may lead to this result in any structure, or in any constitution ; but a moderate degree of inflammation may lead to it also in particular cases. Inflammation of cellular mem- brane terminates in mortification more readily than inflammation of the skin ; and in persons of bad constitution the cellular membrane is more likely to mortify than it is in others. You see examples of this over and over again in the cases of the diffuse cellular inflammation which occurs in dram- drinkers. A small puncture of the leg, or a compound fracture, in which the injury is appa- rently trifling, may cause inflammation extending gradually from the foot to the buttock ; and the whole cellular membrane may in the course of a few days become a putrid slough. I have seen a case in which a patient became affected in this manner from a leech bite; and another in which a similar mischief followed the sting of a bee ; and both these patients died. From what has since fallen under my observation, I have little doubt that they were both dram-drinkers, though I was not sufficiently acquainted with the subject to have my attention directed to it at the time. In the case of the man stung by the bee, however, something may perhaps be attributable to the operation of the animal poison ; and I shall revert to this point hereafter. I once lost a patient with diffuse cel- lular inflammation ending in mortification after the

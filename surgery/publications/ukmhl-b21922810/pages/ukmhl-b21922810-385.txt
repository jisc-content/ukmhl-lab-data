369 MORTIFICATION. reality no internal remedy is so useful as this. I can scarcely remember, in my own practice, a single case of recovery in an old man affected with morti- fication of the toes, in which opium had not been exhibited.

You may at first exhibit half a grain three times daily, and keep him slightly under its influence, but nothing more. If he continues to take it, (and sometimes this may be necessary for months to- gether,) the dose will require to be increased; but you will never be able to persevere in the use of opium except you employ, in combination with it, the remedies which I last mentioned. In these and in all other cases in which opium is taken daily, not only purgatives, but mercurial purga- tives are necessary, otherwise it stops the secretion of bile, and does mischief.

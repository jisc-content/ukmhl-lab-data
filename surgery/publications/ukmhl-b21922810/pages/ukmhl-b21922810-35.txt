Here we can do nothing better than consider what are, on the \yhole, the most reasonable explanations which can be offered of the circumstances of it; and without adopting these explanations as realities, our practice must be a series of experiments founded on them. If our first experiment should not succeed, in our second or third we may be more fortunate ; and in the meantime, every one of them probably gives us a clearer insight into the disease, so th&t we may pro- ceed with more confidence in our treatment of it. But let us suppose another case. A disease is so obscure, or so beset with difficulties, that we are absolutely at a loss how to treat it, having nothing to direct us in our practice. Here we may apply a rule, which is also applicable to all the concerns of life. When we know not what to do, it is better that we should do nothing. Nature may accomplish something for the patient; and if our efforts to assist her are founded on no principle, they are more likely to be mischievous than they are to be useful. It is almost proverbial among us, and I have already expressed the same thing, though in other words, that our object should be to seek remedies for the disease, and not for the symptoms. But there are few general rules which are not to be re- ceived with some degree of limitation. Particular symptoms may be so urgent, that we must endea- vour to relieve them at all events, without reference to the causes which produce them.

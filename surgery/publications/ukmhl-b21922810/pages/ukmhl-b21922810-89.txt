73 EFFECTS OF STRANGULATION. Treatment to be had recourse to in Cases of Strangulation. Death from strangulation takes place at so early a period, that, in the case of a human being at least, it only occasionally happens that the inter- ference of art can be of any service. At all events it can be only by a sort of accident that you will see the patient in the first instance. But such an accident may occur, and you should know how to meet it. Let us suppose, then, that the cord is removed from the neck before the efforts of the diaphragm to draw in air have ceased : all that you have to do is to watch the patient carefully ; if natural respiration continues, to leave him to himself; if it ceases, to supply the want of it by inflating the lungs artificially. If, on the other hand, the efforts of the diaphragm have already ceased, you must have recourse to arti- ficial respiration without delay. The interval which elapses between the suspension of the efforts of the diaphragm and that of the action of the heart, being never more than two or three minutes, you have no time to lose, no leisure for inquiries. If the pulse can be felt, either of the heart or of the arteries, you will know that your patient may probably be saved. But the pulse may be imper- ceptible, and yet some feeble action of the heart may continue sufficient to maintain the circulation, and you must give your patient the chance which artificial respiration affords him, however small it be. If the circulation be still going on, and the

MORTIFICATION. 339 z 2 perfectly applicable to many cases in the early stage of the disease. With a somewhat similar precaution, you may apply caustic to destroy the vascular excrescence, which is met with not un- frequently in the female urethra ; a disease first described by Sir Charles Clarke, and of which you will find some account, also, in my lectures on diseases of the urinary organs. For these cases you should be provided with a silver tube or shield, closed at one end, and open on one side. Introduce this into the urethra, so that the vascular fungus may project into the open side of the tube, and there apply the caustic. Here also you must trust to your assistant dabbing the neigh- bouring parts wTith some liquid which will act as an antidote to the caustic ; a solution of bicar- bonate of potash, if you use the nitric acid, or vinegar, if you use the caustic potash. In general, in these cases, it is better, before you use the caustic, to remove as much of the excrescence as you can with a pair of scissors. I have spoken of the application of caustics in some cases of what I have called half-malignant disease ; but, occasionally, they may be employed in cases of true malignant disease, such as scir- rhus and fungus haematodes. If one of these tumors be of large size, it is better to use the knife; in fact, you cannot remove it otherwise. It is in the case of smaller tumors that you may use caustic with advantage. I will give you an example. A lady consulted me concerning a scirrhous tumor of the breast. The tumor was very small, but there was a scirrhous gland in the

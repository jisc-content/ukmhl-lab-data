140 SERO-CYSTIC TUMORS To complete this history of the disease, as it first shows itself, I may add that the general health is unaffected, and that the patient com- plains of no pain, unless it be that, in some instances, there are those disagreeable nervous sensations which are apt to arise whenever the attention is anxiously directed to any one part of the body. I have never known the disease to occur previously to the age of puberty; it is rare after the middle period of life; and I am inclined to believe it is more common in single than in married women. There are not a few cases in which no morbid changes take place beyond that which I have already described; the cyst remaining unaltered, or only slowly increasing in size during the remainder of the patientâ€™s life. But in other cases the tumors lose their globular form, and a solid substance is deposited in the breast, connecting different cysts with each other in one large mass of disease. This process may be going on for many successive years without inducing pain or much inconvenience, except what belongs to the bulk of the tumor. But the period at last arrives when other changes take place, the disease assuming a more formidable and dangerous cha- racter. The skin, being in some one part more tense and thin than elsewhere, becomes inflamed and ulcerates, and an intractable and bleeding ulcer is the consequence. Then one of the cysts, more distended than the rest, gives way, dis- charging its serous contents. Perhaps the opening heals, then again gives way; and this may recur several times, until at last a fungous growth

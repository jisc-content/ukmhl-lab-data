You may then destroy the tumor with nitric acid; but the best applications, ac- cording to my experience, are the chloride of zinc or arsenic. There is, however, one very serious objec- tion to arsenical caustics applied to a large surface ; namely, that the arsenic is sometimes absorbed, producing severe constitutional symptoms. There was in former times a Miss Plunkett, a quack, who pretended to cure cancer, and it was known after- wards that her secret consisted in the application of arsenical caustics. An old medical practitioner, whom I knew in the early part of my professional life, informed me that it had fallen to his lot to see many of Miss Plunkettâ€™s patients, and that after the application of her caustics many of them died, from what seemed to be inflammation of the bowels. It is indeed notorious that the topical application of arsenic to a great extent is very likely to produce the same poisonous effects as arise from an absorption of it from the alimen- tary canal. The chloride of zinc acts merely locally; nothing deleterious is absorbed into the constitution, and its use is not attended with any constitutional disturbance, nor productive of the smallest danger. I generally use the chloride of zinc by mixing it with an equal quantity of flour. It deliquesces from the moisture of the atmosphere, or you may add a little water to make it into a paste, which is to be spread on lint. If you want a deep slough, spread the paste thick; if a superficial one, spread it as thin as you please. The depth of the slough depends on the thickness

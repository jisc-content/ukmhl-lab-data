EFFECTS OF STRANGULATION. 61 weaker, and, in the course of a very few minutes, cease altogether.* But here the question arises, what is the imme- diate cause of the cessation of the heartâ€™s action ? The circulation of the blood continues only for a certain period after respiration has become sus- pended ; why is that period limited ? Some explanations of this fact have been offered formerly, which will not be accepted in the present more advanced state of physiological science. Especially, it has been said that the motions of the lungs connected with the alternate admission and expulsion of air were somehow necessary to the motion of the heart. Now, it is quite true that whatever, by enlarging the dimensions of the chest, tends to draw air into the lungs, must also tend to draw blood into the heart, and so far it may be supposed that the action of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles may contribute in a small degree to the maintenance of the circulation. The temporary relief which a deep sigh affords under certain circumstances may probably be thus ex- plained. However that may be, an experiment made long ago by Dr. Hook is sufficient to estab- * It appears that in some instances of those who are hanged as criminals other injuries are inflicted besides those which have been enumerated. Dr. Hunter, in two individuals whom he examined, found extensive contusions and lacerations of the muscles, and the arytenoid and thyroid cartilages separated from each other. ( See Pathological Observations by Dr. Hunter, in the Dublin Hospital Reports.) These complications may be attributed to the greater violence exercised in this mode of hanging, compared with that in persons who have attempted suicide.

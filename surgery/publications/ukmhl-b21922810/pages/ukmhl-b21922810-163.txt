147 OF THE FEMALE BREAST. l 2 I have no notes of the early history of the case; but the disease had probably been of long dura- tion ; as, at the time of my being consulted, the breast had attained an enormous size, being not less than seven pounds in weight. She was a middle-aged person, otherwise in good health, and the skin and the axillary glands were free from disease. Under these circumstances the diseased breast was amputated. The wound healed favour- ably ; and I heard of the patient being alive and well, several years afterwards. If you examine the cut surface of the tumor, or rather, of that portion of it which is displayed in the preparation, you will see that the greater part of it is one uniform solid mass, of which it is difficult to describe the structure in words, further than by saying, that in some parts it has an indistinct laminated appearance. There are, however, in one part of it, several membranous cysts of various dimensions, which, when first cut into, were found containing serum. One of these is distinguished from the rest by its greater size, being capable of containing several ounces of fluid, and also by it being occupied by a large excrescence, attached to one part of its inner surface, and projecting into its cavity. This excrescence is of an irregular shape, very similar in appearance to some of those which you have seen in the other preparations. In its recent state it seemed to consist of distinct masses of coagulated albumen, semi-pellucid, some of a light yellow, others approaching to a purple colour, and altogether bearing no small resem- blance to a bunch of white and purple grapes.

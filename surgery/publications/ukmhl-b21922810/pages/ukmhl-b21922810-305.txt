MORTIFICATION. 2S9 to the nature of inflammation itself. Mr. Hunter describes it as consisting in an increased action of the small blood-vessels. If increased action be indicated by a greater degree of contractility in the coats of the vessels, the theory is evidently wrong ; for microscopic examination proves that there is no such thing. But, in fact, this is not what Hunter meant; and in another sense of the words he is clearly right; for the vessels of an inflamed part secrete serum, lymph, and pus, and build up new structures; in short, they do many things which they do not do under ordinary circumstances ; and all this affords an abundant evidence of increased action. Another theory of inflammation, which has been of late promulgated in opposition to that of Hunter, is that the essential part of it is a debility, or a weakened state of the capillaries ; and the propounders of this theory refer to the dilatation of these vessels in proof of it. But I own that I can discover no reason to believe that the dilated state of the capillaries proves any thing, except that there is something in the condition of an inflamed part which makes a greater supply of arterial blood necessary, and that these vessels have the power of adapting themselves to these new circumstances. Nor is this power limited to the capillaries. It exists in the arterial trunks, in which the capillaries have their origin. Thus, in an animal killed by arsenic, in whom the poison produces extensive inflammation of the mucous membrane of the stomach and intestines, the branches of the mesen- teric arteries are seen dilated to double their u

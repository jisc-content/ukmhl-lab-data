EFFECTS OF STRANGULATION. 70 Still the consequences of the strangulation are not at an end, nor is ultimate recovery a matter of course because natural respiration is restored. It would be tedious for me to relate to you all the particular observations which I have made on this interesting and important subject; and it will be sufficient to make you acquainted with their general results. The effects produced by the circulation of dark- coloured blood are not merely* negative. It operates like a narcotic poison, and even after natural respiration is restored the animal remains as insensible to external impressions, and as inca- pable of voluntary movements as if he were under the influence of opium, or the woorara. While in this state he is not unfrequently affected with con- vulsive actions of the voluntary muscles; and even when he first begins to recover there is occasionally, in quadrupeds, a more or less complete paralysis of the muscles of the hind limbs. The state of coma may continue for a few minutes, or for an hour, or even for several hours, the period probably varying according to the length of time during which the dark-coloured blood was circulating. If in one case the cord be removed before the natural efforts to respire have ceased, and in another only just in time to maintain the hearts action by artificial respiration, the period of recovery will be very short in the first case, and probably very long in the second. In some instances, after remaining for a considerable time in a state of coma, respiration is again suspended ; so that if recovery had been effected in the first instance by means of artificial

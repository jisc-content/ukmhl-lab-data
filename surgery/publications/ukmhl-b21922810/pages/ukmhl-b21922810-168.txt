152 SERO-CYSTIC TUMORS had been no recurrence of the disease. Since these cases occurred, I have had recourse to the same method of treatment in a great many instances. In the majority of them the result has been, that the tumor or tumors have entirely disappeared; in others, that, without disappearing altogether, they have become very much reduced in size; and it is only in a few instances in which the treatment was not very rigidly pursued, that it has been productive of no manifest advantage. The application which I have generally made use of on these occasions is the following: â€” 1^ spiritus camphorati, spiritus tenuioris, aa. ^ iijss ; liquoris plumbi diacetatis, ^j.; fiat embrocatio. I have directed the patient to soak a piece of flannel, once folded, in this embrocation, and to apply it so as to cover that part of^the breast in which the tumor is situated, renewing the applica- tion six or eight times in the day and night, until the skin becomes inflamed ; then to omit the appli- cation for two or three days, but to resume the use of it as soon as the inflammation has subsided. The period of time during which it is necessary to pursue this method of treatment varies in different cases. In some, all that can be desired is accom- plished in the course of three or four weeks ; in others, it must be continued, with occasional inter- missions, for some months. Other stimulating applications may be occasionally substituted for that which I have just mentioned. Several blisters may be applied in succession ; each of them being kept open for a few days with the savine cerate ; or a solution of 3j. of iodine in |j. of alcohol may

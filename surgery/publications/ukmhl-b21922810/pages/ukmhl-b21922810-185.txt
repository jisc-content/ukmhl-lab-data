ULCERS OF THE LEGS. 169 respect put the superficial veins, which are dilated and varicose, under the same circumstances with the deep-seated veins. This may, indeed, be accomplished by applying a bandage to the leg. And what kind of bandage ? In many cases where the disease is limited, you may apply merely a partial bandage of adhesive plaster, which will answer the purpose perfectly, giving the patient scarcely any inconvenience. There being, for example, only two or three varicose clusters of small size, you need not trouble the patient with a complete bandage for the whole leg. Have some stripes of adhesive plaster, three or four inches long, according to circumstances, and one inch or an inch and a half wide. First of all, let the patient stand erect, that you may ascertain exactly where the varicose clusters are situated. Having marked the place, let him recline, with the foot raised so that it may be the most elevated part of the whole body. Then, the varix having been thus completely emptied, apply one of the pieces of adhesive plaster across the varicose vessels, and afterwards apply the others in the same manner, drawing up the skin under them, and taking care that the plaster is not thrown into folds. The plasters being applied in this manner, and being strained on the skin beneath, prevent the vein from becoming distended when the patient stands erect. In a great many instances you will find that this is sufficient to give all the support required; and perhaps it is all that will be required for the rest of the patientâ€™s life.

CHRONIC ABSCESS OF THE TIBIA. 403 of the operation, a quantity of what appeared to be sero-purulent fluid gushed out from beside the trephine, mixing with the blood. At the bottom of the bone removed by the instrument there was a cavity that would just receive the end of the finger, and from which the fluid had escaped. After this she had considerable pain for some time, but evidently of an hysterical character. She went into the country ; but I have lately seen her in London, and have been gratified by finding that she is free from all her former symptoms. The wound has been for some time healed, and the lower end of the tibia is already reduced to its natural size. The piece of bone that was taken away is upon the table ; it is more hard and com- pact than it ought to be just above the ankle, where, in the natural state, there is a cancellous structure. You will perceive on its under surface one corner of the cavity in which the sero-purulent fluid was lodged, presenting a smooth surface. Since I first published some account of this operation in the Medico-chirurgical Transactions, it has been successfully performed by Mr. Liston on a private patient, whom I saw in consultation with him; and also on a patient in University College Hospital. It is satisfactory to know that this simple method of treatment has already pre- served many limbs which must have been sacrificed otherwise, and it cannot be doubted that it will be the means of preserving many more, when it is more generally adopted by those who are engaged in operative surgery. d d 2

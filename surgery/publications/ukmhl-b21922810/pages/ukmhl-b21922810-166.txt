150 SERO-CYSTIC TUMORS disease is still in its earliest stage, presenting itself in the form of a membranous cyst, or cysts, containing serum, from those in which the growth of a solid fibrinous substance has become super- added to this simple original structure. In the first order of cases, we may venture to evacuate the fluid contents of the cyst by puncturing it with a grooved needle. No incon- venience is ever the result of this operation; and it is often useful not only by assisting us in our diagnosis, but also by enabling us to determine whether any growth of solid matter, in connection with the cyst, has yet taken place. But it is not productive of any permanent benefit, as the fluid is always regenerated in the course of two or three days. I have no experience which 'would lead me to recommend any further or more considerable operation than this. It is needless to remove what appears to be a solitary cyst, as it is always highly probable that there are other cysts in other parts of the breast co-existing with it, which are not yet sufficiently developed to be perceptible through the skin ; or at any rate, that such cysts will be formed afterwards if they do not exist already : and as to the removal of the entire breast, it is, under these circumstances, an unjustifiable proceed- ing, unless it be in af ew cases in which the cyst or cysts have attained so large a size as to be incon- venient from their bulk. The disease, in its early stage, causes no suffering, and may possibly, even if left to take its own course, remain for years, or for the whole of the patients life, without advanc- ing farther. Moreover there is a simple and safe

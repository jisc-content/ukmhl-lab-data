87 DEATH FROM DROWNING. G 4 have received from some of the medical attendants at the receiving houses of the Royal Humane Society, I am led to believe that the period is very rarely, if ever, longer than this in the human subject. I have remarked that a spasm of the muscles of the glottis seems to prevent the admission of water into the windpipe. Experiments have been made of drowning animals in various coloured liquids in which the coloured substance has been scarcely perceptible in the lungs on dissection. In a large cat which was drowned, I found less than a drachm of water in the ramifications of the bronchi. Dr. Goodwyn drowned a cat in quicksilver, and found not more than half an ounce even of this ponderous liquid in the lungs. It does not appear, however, that the admission of water into the lungs tends to hasten death, or that the spasm of the muscles of the glottis has any effect in preventing dissolution. I drowned a guinea-pig, in which I had previously made an opening in the trachea, so that the spasm of the glottis could have no effect in preventing the water from entering the lungs ; but this made no difference in the symptoms which were produced, and did not prevent the restoration of the animal to life by proper methods. Dr. Good- wyn injected two ounces of water into the trachea of a dog, which at first occasioned some difficulty of breathing. This difficulty soon subsided ; never- theless, when the animal was killed some hours afterwards, the remains of the water were still found in the bronchial tubes. If water were injected into the lungs in sufficient quantity to prevent the

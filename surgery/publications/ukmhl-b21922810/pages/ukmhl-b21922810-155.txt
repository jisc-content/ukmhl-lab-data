OF THE FEMALE BREAST. 139 scarcely a single drop. But in a more advanced stage, it is capable of containing several ounces. In two cases, in each of which I had the oppor- tunity of dissecting a breast affected with this disease, I found small cysts, composed of a thin membrane, and containing serum, pervading the whole of the glandular structure, the intermediate parts of the breast presenting a perfectly healthy and natural appearance; and I could discover nothing more. There seems to be little doubt that the cysts are originally formed by a dilatation of the lactiferous tubes. In one of the preparations now on the table, you will perceive , a bristle introduced into the orifice of one of these tubes opening on the nipple, which has passed into a cyst immediately below ; and it is not uncommon to find that by pressure on the tumor the fluid may be made to escape by the nipple, so that you may even expel the whole of it. The globular form of the tumor, and the impres- sion which the fluid within it gives to the fingers, in general furnishes you with the means of an easy diagnosis in the early stage of the disease. Where there is any doubt on the subject, it may be resolved by the introduction of a grooved needle; to this there is never any objection, and in some cases it is absolutely necessary. Occa- sionally the tumor is so deeply seated, with so much of the gland of the breast lying over it, that even a very experienced person may not at once recognize its nature in the first instance, and may be led to suppose that it is a medullary tumor, or a chronic abscess, or any thing else rather than what it really is.

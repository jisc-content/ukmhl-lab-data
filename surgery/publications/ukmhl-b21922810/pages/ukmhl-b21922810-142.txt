UNUNITED FRACTURES. 126 experiment in other animals, with this difference, that they were not destroyed until the end of the seventh day. Still there was no commencement of the process of union. But after this period, where the main artery of a limb is tied, the formation of callus begins to take place, and then the union goes on as usual. At the end of a week, it is reasonable to suppose that the anastomosing arterial branches will have become dilated, so as to make up for the obliteration of the femoral artery ; but till there is time for this change in the state of the vessels to have taken place, it appears that the limb does not receive blood enough for the process of union to be established. Appearances on Dissection of an Ununited Fracture. The appearances which are observed when you dissect a fracture which has not united at the usual period, are different in different cases. In general, there is union by a ligamentous substance, not by bone. I say ligamentous, for we have no other name to give it; but it is not fibrous : it is merely like a firm, condensed albumen, which has become organized, without a distinct, fibrous structure. There are some cases in which even this kind of union does not take place ; and these cases are very remarkable. A new joint is formedâ€”absolutely a false joint. The broken ends of the bone become rounded: there is a capsule nearly as thick as the capsule of the hip-joint or shoulder; this capsule is fibrous, like ligament; it is attached to the bones above and below the fracture, and there is a cavity,

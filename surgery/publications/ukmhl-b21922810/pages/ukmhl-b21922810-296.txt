280 ADIPOSE TUMORS. There is a tumor of common occurrence in connection with the female breast, which was, I believe, first described by Sir Astley Cooper, and to which he has given the name of chronic mam- mary tumor. It is not a very good name, but I know of no other. This tumor is of a peculiar structure; generally lobulated; and when you examine one lobule you find it composed of smaller lobules still, all adhering to each other by a loose cellular texture. It occurs, for the most part, in young women. I was called to see a young lady some years ago who had a tumor on one side of her breast, which seemed to be of this description; and I removed it by an operation. When I examined the tumor afterwards, I found that, although it had much of the appearance of the chronic mammary tumor, it bore considerable resemblance to a fatty tumor also; that is, it contained a good deal of fatty matter. This case called my attention to the subject; and, since then, other cases have occurred which lead me to suspect that the fatty tumor and the chronic mammary tumor stand in a certain degree of relationship to each other; the structure being probably modified by the peculiar organization of the part in which the disease is situated. In the case which I have just mentioned the character of the fatty tumor predominated; but I have seen other tumors in which the same character existed, but to a less extent; and even where the characters of the two diseases are most distinctly marked, there is this point of resemblance between them: the adhesion of them to the neighbouring

ADIPOSE TUMORS. 272 within the abdominal ring, and which, as it in- creased in size, had made its way in that direction in which there was the least resistance, that is, into the loose cellular structure of the scrotum. When a fatty tumor has a deep-seated origin beneath a muscle, a small portion of it will some- times present itself, while the rest remains con- cealed ; and this circumstance, if it does not lead to any absolute difficulty as to diagnosis, will at any rate mislead you as to the extent of the disease. Very lately a patient consulted me respecting a tumor below the arm-pit. It seemed to be a common fatty tumor, of about half the size of an ordinary orange, but I could not pass my fingers behind it. It was plain that I could not trace it to its origin ; however, I made an incision on it, and then found an enormous tumor pro- ceeding from the axilla. It extended from thence far backwards into the space between the scapula and the ribs. In fact, it was impossible to dissect out the whole of the tumor ; and I was under the necessity, having drawn out as much of it as I could, of applying a ligature round it, and removing that portion of it which was below the ligature with the knife, leaving the remainder where I found it.

When it is of a large size, a thick fascia is formed over it, similar to that which is formed over a large hydrocele or hernia. In different parts of the fascia are cir- cular spaces, into which the finger will penetrate, as if into the substance of the tumor. The skin over a fatty tumor very rarely inflames and

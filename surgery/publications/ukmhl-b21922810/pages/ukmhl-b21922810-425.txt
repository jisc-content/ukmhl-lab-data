409 CHRONIC ABSCESS OF THE TIBIA. health had been in a bad state previously, had an attack of erysipelas, and died. Of course I did not neglect to examine the knee-joint, and I have the notes of the dissection before me. The whole upper part of the tibia was increased in size from a deposit of bone on the surface. The cavity from which the dead bone had been extracted was of the size of a large cherry, and it had a smooth internal surface, the bone around it being somewhat harder than natural. From this a sinus extended to the knee-joint, and opened into it just at the anterior part of the spine of the tibia. There was no suppuration in the joint. The cartilage covering the head of the tibia in some places was perfect in its structure, but it existed only in narrow stripes; in other parts it had degenerated into a substance something like condensed cellular mem- brane ; in others the only vestige of it was a kind of membrane,â€”so thin that you could see the bone through it; and in other parts the surface of the tibia was completely exposed, but not carious. The bone of the tibia was more compact than under ordinary circumstances. It was curious that the condyles of the femur had suffered also, though in a different manner. The bone, instead of being harder, was softer than natural, so that you might cut it with a knife. The cartilage adhered imper- fectly to the bone ; it could be peeled off, and in some places had begun to ulcerate. The softening of the condyles of the tibia, I have no doubt, was the consequence, and not the cause, of the disease ; for you will observe that all bones in a state of inaction lose a great part of their phosphate of E E

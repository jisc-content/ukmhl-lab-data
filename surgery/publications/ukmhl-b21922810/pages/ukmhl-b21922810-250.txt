ADMINISTRATION OF MERCURY 234 hospital I have tried to treat syphilitic patients without mercury with very little success indeed; and I venture to say, that in private practice the attempt to adopt this plan, as a general rule, will always be a failure. Sir William Whymper, who was formerly surgeon-major of the Coldstream Guards, and who saw a great deal of syphilitic practice, told me that he could manage the cases of private soldiers in this way, but not those of the officers. Mr. Rose at first wTas led to believe that he might adopt the method of treatment which he had followed in the army in private practice also ; but he soon found that here it was unsuccessful, and at last he gave mercury like other persons. In cases where he did not ad- minister it, he found that he was continually becoming involved in difficulties. With regard to the other notion, that mercury often tends to aggravate the disease instead of curing it, I know that its injudicious use will often produce that effect; but, from the experience which I have had in these matters, I am satisfied that it is not so with its wise and judicious administratibn. It has been said that diseases of the bones do not occur where mercury is not employed; and, indeed, I believe that in patients in whom mercury has been injudiciously used, disease of the bones is more frequently met with than it was in Mr. Rose’s military patients, in whom mercury was not had recourse to. I know, also, that when mercury is given for other diseases—for example, for an hepatic affection, or for diseased testicle,—it will sometimes be productive of nodes afterwards.

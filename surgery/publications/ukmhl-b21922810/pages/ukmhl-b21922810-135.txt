119 UNUNITED FRACTURES. stances may be divided into four series of changes : first, there is the effusion of albumen, thicken- ing and consolidation of the surrounding textures, and the formation of callus ; secondly, there is the ossification of the callus ; thirdly, there is a grow- ing together of the broken bones, and the identifi- cation of the surfaces which are in contact with each other ; lastly, there is the absorption of the ossified callus; and these changes take place in succession, in whatever manner the broken bones are in contact, whether it be by their broken surfaces, or laterally, or in any other way. The process of union is completed in young persons sooner than in those who are advanced in life. In the upper extremities it is completed sooner than in the lower. Thus in the human subject, while it occupies six or eight weeks in the arm or fore-arm, it may occupy nine or ten weeks in the thigh or leg. In the smaller animals union takes place more speedily than it does in man. Circumstances under which Fractures do not unite. Fractures sometimes are not repaired in conse- quence of the anatomical structure of the parts in which the accident has occurred. The neck of the thigh-bone, when broken within the capsule of the hip-joint, does not become united. The fact is no- ticed by Morgagni, but it was not generally known until the observation was repeated by Sir Astley Cooper. It has been a question of late much agitated, whether bony union of the neck of the i 4

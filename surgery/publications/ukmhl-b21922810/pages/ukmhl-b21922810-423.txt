CHRONIC ABSCESS OF THE TIBIA. 407 years pieces of bone continued to come away, none of large size. Among the sinuses that were open, there was one a little below the knee- joint ; I could not ascertain whether bone had come from it or not, but it closed ; and the patient appeared quite well. In the year 1835 or 1836, however, I was consulted by him again on account of some pain in the upper end of the tibia. When- ever he walked, the knee-joint swelled, becoming full of fluid. I applied leathern splints, kept him quiet, and he seemed to recover. I then left off the splints, and allowed him to walk as usual. The result was, that in the course of two or three days the knee wtls again filled with synovia. On a blister being applied, the fluid was again ab- sorbed, but re-appeared again on exercise. Taking these circumstances into account, and remembering that there had been pain for some time in the upper end of the tibia, and formerly a sinus leading to the centre of the bone, I thought it very probable that the knee-joint was only secondarily affected in consequence of some dis- ease in the neighbouring portion of the tibia. Mr. Keate and Mr, Liston saw the patient with me, and agreed in the opinion that it would be prudent to perforate the head of the tibia with a trephine. Finding, as well as I could, the most tender spot, I performed the operation, and out gushed three or four drachms of matter. There was no pain afterwards; the wound gradually contracted and healed, and now, when the patient walked, there was no swelling of the knee. The operation was performed in 1837, and I have seen

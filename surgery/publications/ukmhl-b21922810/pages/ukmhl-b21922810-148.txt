132 UNUNITED FRACTURES. was accomplished. The fourth case was that of a little boy with an ununited fracture of the tibia. The seton was introduced between the bones, and allowed to remain, if my recollection be accurate (for I have not been able to lay my hand on my notes of the case), for some months, but with no advantage whatever. Mr. Stansfield, of Leeds, performed the same operation in a case of ununited fracture of the arm, and with success. Mr. Earle also performed it on the arm, but it failed. The result of the practice in this country appears to be, that sometimes it has succeeded in the upper extremities, but that where it has been performed on the lower extre- mities, as far as I know, it has only succeeded in a single instance—namely, that of the patient in this hospital, under my care. Dr. Dorsey (who was Dr. Physick’s nephew, and adjunct professor with him in Philadelphia), in the last letter which I had from him before his death, informed me, as the result of the operation with the seton in the United States, that it had generally suc- ceeded in the upper limbs, but that it had always failed in the lower. He added, that in the former case, it was often necessary to keep the seton in for several months. The operation is, to say the best of it, uncertain, and the result tedious. Another method of treatment has been proposed by Mr. Amesbury, which I believe to have been more successful than any of those which I have before mentioned; and which has this re- commendation, that if it do no good, it can do no harm. Mr. Amesbury proposes to keep the

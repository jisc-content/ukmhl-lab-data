ADMINISTRATION OF MERCURY 236 had gone on at once to the second order, and affected the bones. The conclusion of the case was, that the patient got entirely well under the use of sarsaparilla. Experience proves to me, and I am sure that it will prove to you also, that we have hitherto found no remedy having the same power of extinguishing the venereal poison as mercury. But then it must be judiciously administered at the time, and in such cases only as are proper for it; and without all this care it may do great harm. In this there is nothing at all remarkable, for (with the excep- tion, perhaps, of sarsaparilla,) I do not know any medicine capable of doing great good, that may not, under certain circumstances, operate as a poison. I saw a gentleman very nearly killed by an over-dose of quinine; others have died in con- sequence of the imprudent exhibition of the iodide of potassium ; and others have been killed by arsenic. A remedy that is strong enough to do good is almost invariably strong enough to do harm, if it be not used properly. You are not, then, to suppose that you are to administer mercury as a matter of course in all cases of syphilis ; but the general rule is, that it should be given ; and it being so, I shall endeavour to point out briefly, not the cases in which you may exhibit it, but those in which you should either not give it at all, or give it with especial caution. There are persons of a certain delicate constitu- tion, having what is called a scrofulous diathesis, disposed to phthisis, and other diseases of the same class, and here you should not administer mercury

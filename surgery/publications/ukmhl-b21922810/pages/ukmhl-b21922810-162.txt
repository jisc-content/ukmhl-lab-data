SERO-CYSTIC TUMORS 146 We can scarcely doubt, that if in this case the operation had been deferred until a later period, the growths of fibrinous matter, by which the cysts were occupied, would have contracted universal adhesions to the membrane with which they lay in contact, and that the whole, with the exception of those cysts which still contained serum, would have been identified in one solid mass of substance, in which the original cystic structure would have entirely disappeared. Of this last-mentioned change, the preparation which I now show you seems to furnish an example. The patient from whom this specimen was taken was under my care in the year 1818. Key, who has been so kind as to send me the following account of the appearances which the tumor presented. “ It was solid, “ containing an amber-coloured pulpy mass disposed in cells. “ In one small spot there was a dark-coloured mass resembling “ the fungoid tubercles that occur on the cheek, and that are of <c a malignant character. The cyst containing the mass was dense, and in one spot adhered firmly to the pectoral ’ muscle.” It seems to me not improbable that the recurrence of the disease in this case arose from some small portion of the gland having been left adhering to the integuments in the former operation. There can be little doubt that this happened in another case, which may be thus briefly stated. A lady con- sulted a surgeon of eminence on account of a tumor of the breast, which he removed by an operation. I had the oppor- tunity of examining the tumor, which consisted of a single membranous cyst, containing a dark-coloured serum. About (three years afterwards a chain of small globular tumors ap- peared in the neighbourhood of the cicatrix, which were removed by myself. They proved to be membranous bags, containing dark-coloured serum, similar to the original tumor. This was several years since, and there was no recurrence of the disease.

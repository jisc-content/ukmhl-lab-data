UNUNITED FRACTURES. 125 wards she broke her fore-arm, and union did not take place. A young man had been for many months living very low on account of a complaint under which he laboured, and under these cir- cumstances broke both bones of his fore-arm. At the end of several months there was no union. Cases of ununited fracture are not very common, yet here are three among those which have fallen under my observation, in which the want of union seems clearly to be traced to the bad state of the constitution, produced by abstinence from food. A man broke his thigh ; his bowels were costive, and his surgeon allowed him to remain without an evacuation for ten days after the accident, and in him the broken bones did not unite. We can- not be certain that it was this long continued costiveness which prevented the union of the fracture, but it seems probable that it was so. If loose bandaging may prevent a fracture from uniting, by permitting the bones to have too great latitude of motion, I think it very probable that tight bandaging may in some cases produce just the same effect. If the limb be too tightly ban- daged, especially above the fracture, it must have an insufficient supply of blood; and it is reason- able to suppose, that, this being the case, the resto- rative process which produces union of a fracture may not take place. I have made the following experiment several times :â€”I have broken the thigh of a rabbit, then tied the femoral artery, and killed the animal at the end of four days, and found the parts just as they would have been immediately after the injury. I have repeated the

99 DEATH FROM DROWNING. h 2 proaching to dissolution a greater number will owe their recovery to unassisted nature, than to the most judicious treatment. But let us not on this account undervalue the knowledge which physio- logical investigations throw on this interesting sub- ject. The preservation of the body from the influ- ence of external cold must be always important, where the progress of recovery is tedious ; and although the cases in which the artificial inflation of the lungs can be advantageously employed are rare, yet there are occasions in which the life of a dying man may be preserved by the judicious ap- plication of this remedy. Moreover we must ex- press our obligations to science, if she teaches us to avoid things which ignorance has suggested as useful, but which are really detrimental; or even if, by attending to her instructions, we are enabled to reject what is useless and frivolous, although not absolutely injurious. We have been directed to employ friction of the surface of the body for the purpose of assisting the circulation of the blood; as if this could do any real good when the action of the heart has ceased; or as if it would not do actual harm by overloading (if I may be allowed to use such an expression) the right auricle and ventricle, when the action of the heart was still going on. The injection of tobacco, and the appli- cation of stimulants, belong to the same class of remedies which are either mischievous or useless, proposed formerly by those who did not know what to do, but who thought that they were expected to do something, but now rejected by a more en- lightened physiology.

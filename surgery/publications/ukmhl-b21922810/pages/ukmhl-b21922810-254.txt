There are some individuals in whom, for reasons which we cannot assign, mercury always operates as a poison, and you cannot tell who these individuals are until you have made the trial. This is in itself a sufficient reason why you should carefully watch every patient in whose case you administer mercury, especially if he has not taken it before. In the case of primary sores, where there is a great deal of inflammation in the neighbourhood, it is scarcely ever right to employ mercury in the first instance, for the probability is that it will cause the inflammation to terminate in sloughing. The inflammation in such cases must be com- bated by bleeding, purging, and other means, and it is better to patch up the sore as well as you can, and let the disease go on, until it has produced secondary symptoms, rather than to exhibit mer- cury under the circumstances just mentioned. In cases of phagedenic and sloughing chancre, where its condition depends on a bad state of the patientâ€™s constitution, it is always wrong to give mercury at first, for it will aggravate the disease and make it spread more rapidly, But there are cases in which the phagedena depends on the intense action of the venereal poison ; and here, as I shall explain presently, mercury may be given.

The inner surface of the cavity was exceedingly tender, so that the introduction of the linger, or even of a probe, could scarcely be borne. On the following day there was a good deal of inflammation in the neighbourhood of the part in which the operation was performed ; and in the course of a few days more an abscess formed, which burst externally just below the ankle. This was followed by some other collections of matter, apparently on the surface of the bone, but they all healed without any exfoliation. The opening made by the trephine became filled up with granulations, and the wound healed favourably. This took place many years ago ; I have seen the patient every now and then since, and he has continued perfectly well. I have had two cases of this kind under my care in this hospital. One was a boy, who had a con- siderable enlargement of the lower end of the tibia, attended with a great deal of pain. I trephined the bone, and let out nearly half an ounce of matter.

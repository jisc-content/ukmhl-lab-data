411 CHRONIC ABSCESS OF THE TIBIA. I persevered, but still there was no matter, and at last the instrument penetrated completely from one side of the bone to the other. The bone was very hard and compact, and it was as much as the trephine could do to saw it through. I thought that I had made a blunder, and that there being no abscess the operation would not be attended with any benefit. The next morning the patient had an attack of pain almost as severe as before the operation, but it did not last long, and he never had any pain afterwards. The wound healed, the relief was complete, and I heard of him not along ago as having continued quite well. I presume that this was a case of chronic inflammation of the humerus, and that taking out the piece of bone from the centre, probably, partly by relieving the tension, and partly by a discharge of matter from the bone unloading the vessels, accounted for the relief which the patient obtained from the operation. THE END.

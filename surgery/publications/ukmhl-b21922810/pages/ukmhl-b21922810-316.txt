300 MORTIFICATION. conclude this present lecture, I am tempted to draw your attention: both because they will serve to illustrate the observations which I have already made: and, because the disease is one with which you ought to be made acquainted, but which, as far as I know, has not been distinctly described by surgical writers. Here, as in cases of erysipelas of the skin, there is a rigor followed by an attack of fever preceding the local symptoms. The latter show themselves in the form of pain in the neighbourhood of the wound or contusion, and an oedematous swelling of the scalp, without any redness of the skin. The swelling pits on pressure. It spreads over the whole scalp to the forehead, and sometimes over the whole face, the skin still retaining its natural colour, or even appearing paler than natural. The progress of the swelling is accompanied by pain in the head, and a continuance of febrile symptoms. In some cases, the disease, after having continued for ten, or twelve, or perhaps fourteen days, begins to sub- side ; the serum which caused the oedematous swelling being gradually absorbed without any further mischief. In other cases, suppuration takes place underneath the scalp, with extensive sloughing of the cellular membrane, and this is followed by sloughing, not only of the scalp above, but of the pericranium underneath. I have known the latter destroyed to such an extent as to lay bare a large portion of the bone of the cranium. If you would prevent all this great mischief, you must by one method or another relieve the tension caused by the oedematous effusion into the cellular

There are different kinds of bandages, and sometimes one sort will answer best, and sometimes another. You may use a common roller of coarse unbleached calico, such as we use in the hospital. In some persons you will find a flannel roller more convenient; at any rate, the patient can apply it better for himself. In private practice I frequently recommend a bandage which is made of stocking web. This is very convenient, being easily applied, and making a very equal pressure ; but it cannot be well used by the poorer classes of society, being more ex- pensive in the first instance, and being also good for nothing after it has been washed a few times. There is another kind of bandage, made altogether of the India rubber or caoutchouc web, in the form of a roller; but it confines too much the heat of the legs ; and, moreover, does not in most instances afford a sufficient support to the weak vessels. I must here make a few observations respecting the use of the roller. It should be applied from the foot upwards.

Especially the pressure above ought not to be greater than that below ; for in that case the veins below must necessarily become distended. A tight garter increases varicose veins ; and the patient ought to be told not to wear a

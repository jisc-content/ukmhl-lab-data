CORNS AND BUNIONS. 215 and second phalanx make an angle, projecting upwards. The second joint of the toe becomes prominent above, and a corn is formed over it. If the shoe, instead of being too narrow, be too short for the foot which it contains, the last phalanges of all the smaller toes are kept con- stantly in a half-bent state, and a rowT of corns is generated, one being situated on the upper part of the last joint of each of these toes. I have endeavoured to enumerate what may be regarded as the most ordinary localities of corns ; but of course they may be produced any where else, according to the shape of the shoe, the mode of walking, and other circumstances. I have said that a corn is, in the first instance, a thickening of the cuticle secreted by the cutis, when it is kept in a state of constant irritation by the operation of external pressure squeezing it against a prominent surface of a bone. But a complete corn is more than this. A bursa, or bag of synovial membrane, similar to those bursae which are of original formation, but of a very small size, is formed between the thickened cuticle and the cutis ; and it is this combination of thickened cuticle with a subjacent bursa, which constitutes a perfect corn. This is a fact which you may easily verify for yourselves, as the opportunities of dissecting corns are abundant in the dead house of the hospital. The thickened cuticle of those corns, which are situated externally, becomes dry, and hard, and horny; while that of the corns which are situated between the toes remains soft, and to a certain

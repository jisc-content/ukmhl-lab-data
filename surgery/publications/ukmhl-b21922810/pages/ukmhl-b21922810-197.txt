181 ULCERS OF THE LEGS. n 3 You have an opportunity of seeing stripes of diachylon plaster applied over and over again every day in the wards of the hospital; and, there- fore, it might seem almost superfluous for me to make any observations on the mode of applying them. Still as I find that new dressers very seldom apply them in the manner that I believe to be most useful, I shall offer to you some observations on the subject, which may, at all events, be useful to the junior students. The stripes, previously warmed, should be applied round the limb, the two ends crossing each other in front, the application beginning below the ulcer, and extending some way above it. Each of the stripes ought to overlap the one below by one half of its diameter. Thus every part has a double piece of plaster over it, and you secure more equal pressure than you could otherwise obtain. It is of great consequence that the plaster should be tight enough to give comfortable support to the limb, and at the same time not so tight as to make the limb swell below; for if it should produce this effect, it is very likely that it will bring on a sloughing of the sore. The plasters ought to make uniform pressure ; that is, the pressure should be equal throughout; or if there be any difference in the degree of pressure, it ought to be greater below than above. If you do not attend to this point, the plaster above operates as a tight garter, and does harm instead of good to the lower part of the ulcer. When you apply the plaster, it should always be with the heel raised, the patient lying flat on

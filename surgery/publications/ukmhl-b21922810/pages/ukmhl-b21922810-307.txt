MORTIFICATION. 291 or perhaps wholly, prevented. It is reasonable to suppose, that, in consequence of the extreme distension, the fluid in the cellular membrane causes so much pressure on the vessels which supply the skin as to impede the passage of the blood through them, and that the punctures of the scrotum and the escape of the serum prevent the mischief which would otherwise have ensued, merely by removing the pressure. When a com- mon abscess opens, as it sometimes does by mortifi- cation and sloughing of a portion of the skin over it, we are not to regard the mortification as the mere result of inflammation, any more than in the case which I have just stated. The ulcerative process going on under the skin destroys a portion of the vessels by which the skin is supplied ; the pressure of the matter prevents the free passage of the blood through those which remain; and thus a due supply of blood being prevented, the skin perishes. Treatment of Cases in which Inflammation terminates in Mortification. Whatever tends to lessen the violence of the inflammation, ought to prevent, or check, the pro- gress of the mortification ; and, on these grounds, it may be expected that the patient will derive benefit from the abstraction of blood. But, on the other hand, the abstraction of the blood, by which the life of a part is supported, if car- ried beyond a certain point, is of itself an adequate cause of mortification ; and the abstraction of even u 2

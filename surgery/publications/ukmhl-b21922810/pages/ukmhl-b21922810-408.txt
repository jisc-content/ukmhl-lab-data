MORTIFICATION. 392 the slough. I do not know whether such applica- tions have this effect or not; perhaps they may; at any rate, they can do no harm. When the sloughs are separated, the patientâ€™s system will be relieved; but he will require support, both from food and medicine. If they were not useful before, he will now derive benefit from tonics, especially from bark. Although I much doubt the efficacy of these remedies in the early stage of the disease, I have no doubt they are very efficient and very useful at this period, when the sloughs have separated. M. Dupuytren says that there are elongations of the subcutaneous cellular membrane which extend into the skin, and that when one of these becomes inflamed it forms a boil, but if several be inflamed they form a carbuncle. It may be so ; the disease may begin in the elongations of the cellular membrane of which he speaks, as far as I know. But there is something more than this. I do not believe a carbuncle to be a mere local affection; it is a constitutional disease, and is always preceded by something wrong in the general health. It seems to me as if there were something like a poison in the circulation, which is thrown out of it into the cellular membrane in cases of carbuncle, so that we might be justified in classing this disease with small pox and the other exanthemata. In a case of s'mall-pox, there is first an attack of fever, which is relieved as soon as the pustules appear; and as these contain the variolous poison, there is little reason to doubt that it is the expulsion of the poison from the

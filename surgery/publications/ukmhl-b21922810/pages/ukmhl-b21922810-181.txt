ULCERS OF THE LEGS. 165 m 3 In some cases inflammation of an inflamed vari- cose cluster will end in suppuration, the bursting of the abscess being followed by an ulcer. But that is not the way in which ulcers connected with varicose veins generally begin. For the most part, the effect of inflammation of a varicose cluster is not to produce either abscess or ulcer. It is very remarkable that the blood in inflamed vari- cose veins coagulates, and they become choked up with the coagulum. There seems to be some- thing in an inflamed vein that is unfavourable to the fluidity of the blood which it contains. You observe this not only when varicose veins of the legs are inflamed, but when veins are inflamed under other circumstances: as in a case of piles. A patient comes to you with an external pile, which is large, and very tenderâ€”it is inflamed. At first it contains fluid blood, but in a day or two it becomes filled with solid matter; and if you slit it open, you find a solid lump of dark-coloured fibrine. If you slit open an inflamed varicose cluster in the leg, under these circumstances, you will also find that the cavity is filled up in like manner with coagulated blood. I mention this, that you may know what takes place in these inflamed veins, not recommending the practice, which is quite wrong, as I shall explain by and by. The effect of such inflammation is to give the patient a good deal of pain at the time, but he is benefited by it afterwards. The coagulum fills up the vein, and the vein becomes obliterated. Other varicose clusters may appear afterwards, but this one is cured. So in the case of an inflamed pile,

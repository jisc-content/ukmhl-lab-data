123 UNUNITED FRACTURES. larged. The principal enlargement was in one of the clavicles, the bone being much diseased besides. This man, in using his arm, broke the collar bone, the fracture going through the diseased part. I bound up the limb, and, with such knowledge as I then had, I concluded that there would be no union; but to my surprise it united quite as soon as ordinary fractures. Women labouring under cancer of the breast are very liable to scirrhous disease of the bones. Sometimes this disease, which is indicated by pains like those of the most severe rheumatism, will affect nearly the whole of the bones, which then become brittle, and very liable to break. Such a case occurred to me when I was a student. The patient was an old woman, dying of cancer, and who, in turning one day in bed, broke one of her thigh bones. I concluded that the broken bone would not unite; but union took place as well as under ordinary circumstances. I attended a lady who had cancer of the breast, and pains of the limbs, indicating scirrhous disease of the bones. One of her clavicles was diseased in this manner; and one day, in moving her arm, it was broken; but it united, just as if it had been a healthy bone. It sometimes happens, when a fracture has been attended with more than usual injury, that a piece of muscle slips between the fractured extremities of the bone, and keeps them asunder; and, under these circumstances, as there is not that actual contact of the broken bones, which is necessary to union, union does not take place.

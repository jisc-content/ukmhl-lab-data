EEFECTS OF STRANGULATION. 62 lish the fact, that the powerful muscle of the heart does not in reality require any such external aid for the due performance of its ordinary functions. This distinguished philosopher having laid open the thorax of a dog so as to expose the heart and lungs, and having applied the nozzle of a pair of double bellows to the trachea, made a great number of punctures in the pleura on the surface of the lungs. The air-cells being thus exposed, by means of the double bellows, he maintained a con- stant stream of air through the lungs, that which entered by the trachea finding its way out by the superficial air-cells. Thus, respiration was kept up while the lungs were perfectly quiescent. The result was, that the heart continued to act vigorously as long as the current of air through the lungs was uninterrupted. When the use of the bellows was suspended, its actions became more feeble ; when it was resumed, they regained their strength. Another hypothesis has been, that the heart is made to contract by the blood in its cavities acting as a stimulus to its muscular fibres ; but that this property is confined to the scarlet blood, which has just received the vivifying influence of oxygen, and of which there is, of course, no supply after the obstruction of respiration. But the right ven- tricle, which, under no circumstances, contains anything but dark-coloured venous blood, con- tracts, as well as the left. If it be said that the two ventricles are intimately connected with each other, that they contract simultaneously, and that the scarlet blood in the left ventricle acts as a stimulus

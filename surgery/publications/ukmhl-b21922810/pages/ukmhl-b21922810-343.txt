32 7 MORTIFICATION. y 4 cellular membrane, terminating in gangrene, which I noticed in a former lecture. But I do not recol- lect that I ever saw the same thing to happen after the use of caustic. The cases, however, to which caustics are applicable, are only those in which the morbid growth is of small size, and placed quite superficially. Undoubtedly, it would cause too much suffering to the patient, and, in consequence, too great a shock to the constitution, if a morbid growth of very large size were to be destroyed in this manner. There is a very common kind of morbid growth in the form of warts and condylomata, which occur in women about the pudenda, and in men on the glans penis and about the anus. These are very easily destroyed by caustic. The nitrate of silver will destroy warts on the glans penis very well, il they are of limited extent, but not when they are collected in large masses. In such cases as these strong nitric acid may be employed. Rub the warts with it, and repeat the application, from time to time, till the whole are destroyed. The following application will answer the purpose in cases where the warts are not very extensive: a drachm of hydro-chloric acid, added to three drachms of sesqui-chloride tincture of iron. This destroys the warts, but not very rapidly. The application must be repeated every day for some time, until they shrivel, decay, and drop off; and the patient may do this for himself. There is a very common escharotic, and a very useful one, for warts on the glans penis or pudenda, where they do not exist to a great extent, namely, equal parts of powdered

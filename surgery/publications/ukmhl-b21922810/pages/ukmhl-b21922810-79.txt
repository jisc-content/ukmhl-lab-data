EFFECTS OF STRANGULATION. 63 to the muscular fibres of the right ventricle also, it may be answered, that it is quite true that in the human subject the connection of the two ven- tricles is intimate enough, but that it is not so in all animals. In the dugong, for example, they are quite separate and distinct; and in the whole race of fish therQ is only a single heart, which, receiving the blood from the general system, and transmitting it to the organs of respiration, of course contains only that which is dark-coloured. Under the influence of higher views in physio- logy, Bichat has furnished us with another solution of the connection which exists between the func- tions of the lungs and those of the heart. The florid scarlet blood is necessary to the generation of muscular irritability. In a suffocated animal the dark-coloured blood penetrates the muscular struc- ture of the heart by the coronary, as it does the rest of the system by the other arteries; and the irritability of the heart, when it is once exhausted, is not renewed in the usual manner. But there is more than this. In the free discussion of received opinions, without which no advances can be made in science, we are led to inquire whether the doc- trine of Haller, that the contractions of the heart are produced by the contact of the blood in its cavities, be really well founded ? It seems to me that there is abundant evidence to the contrary. Let an opening be made into one or all of the great vessels near the heart; — the veins that take the blood in, or the arteries that carry it out;—the cavities are then almost instantaneously emptied of blood; but the contractions of the heart continue

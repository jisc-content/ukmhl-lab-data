DEATH FROM DROWNING. 95 “ making a thick substance, somewhat similar to “ that formed by the spermatic artery of the bull. “ These vessels, everywhere lining the sides of the “ thorax, are seen between the ribs, near their arti- “ culations, and also behind the ligamentous attach- “ ments of the ribs, anastomosing with each other. “ The medulla spinalis is surrounded by a network “ of arteries in the same manner, more especially “ where it comes out of the brain, where a thick “ substance is formed by their ramifications and “ convolutions, and these vessels most probably “ anastomose with those of the thorax. The “ subclavian artery in the piked w7hale, before it “ passes over the first rib, sends down into the “ chest arteries which assist the intercostals in “ forming a plexus on the inside of the ribs. “ There are similar plexuses formed in the neck “ of the whale by branches of the carotids.” Whoever will examine the preparation which I now show you, exhibiting this remarkable struc- ture, and which appears to have been taken from a porpoise of no great size, wTill perceive that Mr. Hunters description scarcely gives an adequate notion of the magnitude and extent of this mass of convoluted arteries. We cannot but suppose, that it must answrer some important purpose connected with the peculiar habits of the being to which it belongs. It is evident that this enormous vascular plexus forms a reservoir of blood, containing many times the quantity that is expelled from the heart at each contraction of the left ventricle; and that it is a reservoir of scarlet arterial blood, which has not yet been used for the purposes of

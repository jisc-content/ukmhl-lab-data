THE MEDICAL PROFESSION. 15 or a steam engine, which, being broken, you must send to the clock-maker or engineer to mend it; and which cannot be repaired otherwise. The living machine, unlike the works of human in- vention, has the power of repairing itself; it contains within itself its own engineer, who, for the most part, requires no more than some very slight assistance at our hands. We bring the edges of a wound into contact, but the vascular union, which constitutes the healing by the first intention, is the wTork of a higher art than any that we profess to practise. If this mode of union fails, and the wound is to be healed by granu- lations, still this is not accomplished by our means. So, where there is a simple fracture, all that we can do is to place the two ends of the bones in a proper position, and keep them in it. The process by which they are made to unite, so as to be again consolidated into one bone, is not under our dominion and control. These are, it is true, examples of slighter and simpler injury ; but even in those in which the injury is more severe and complicated it is easy for us to interfere to the patients disadvantage, and, in fact, it may be truly said, that there is, on the whole, more harm done by too much than there is by too little interference. A pa- tient with a compound fracture of the leg, or a wound of the knee-joint, stands a comparatively bad chance of recovery, if the surgeon, in his daily visits, disturbs the position of the limb, intro- ducing his probe into the wounds and sinuses, and dressing them to the bottom with lint.

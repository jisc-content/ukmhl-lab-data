There was a fungus protruding, and in the centre of the fungus there was an opening, through which a probe could be passed to the bottom of the tumor. There was also an enlarged gland in the axilla. Sir Astley Cooper saw the patient with me; and as she was suffering dreadfully from the ulcerated tumor, we agreed that she should have the breast removed, not expecting a permanent cure, but merely that she might obtain relief from her present distress. The operation was performed; the wound healed, and she had no return of disease in the breast; but a year afterwards her physician in the country wrote to me, saying that she had symptoms of some malignant disease going on in the chest. She died of effusion into the pleurae. There was another lady with an ulcerated scirrhous tumor of the breast, which was so painful as to make her life miserable. I told her that I could not promise her a permanent cure ; but as she was suffering so severely, she might as well have the tumor removed, nevertheless. She did so, and she lived in comfort for many months.

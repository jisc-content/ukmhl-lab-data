MORTIFICATION. 353 but through the anastomosing branches. Some years ago, I was called, with Sir Charles Clarke and Mr. Bryant, of the Edge ware Road, to see a case ap- parently similar, which terminated more fortunately. A lady, without any evident reason, was seized, all at once, with pain in one groin, and down the anterior and inner part of the thigh, with great tenderness in the course of the femoral artery. When I first saw her, which was not till some days afterwards, the whole leg below the middle was in a state of mortification. There was no cedematous swelling of the foot, and no vesication. She had still pain in the course of the femoral artery, which was aggravated by pressure ; and the pulse could not be felt in any part of the limb. Considering the resemblance of this case to the one which I have just mentioned, I could entertain no doubt that the disease was the same, and that the mortification of the leg was the consequence of arterial inflammation. After some time the soft parts began to separate, until, at last, the lower part of the leg and the foot remained attached to the rest of the limb, merely by the tibia and fibula. I sawed through these bones, after which the parts gradually healed, forming a very fair stump. Perhaps you will ask why I proceeded in this manner, instead of ampu- tating the limb at once. The fact is, that I remembered a case, published in Saviardâ€™s Obser- vations on Surgery, (Saviard was a celebrated French surgeon in the early part of the eighteenth century,) which was very similar to this which I have just mentioned, and in which he amputated

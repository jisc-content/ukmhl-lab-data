328 MORTIFICATION. savine and verdigris. This, being sprinkled on the warts, destroys them, partly by making them slough, and partly by promoting their absorption. Another excellent caustic, on this and some other occasions, is this : take half an ounce of strong nitric acid; add to it a scruple or more of the white oxide of arsenic. It makes a beautiful blue solution, consisting of the nitrate of arsenic, dis- solved in nitric acid. This may be applied to the warts by means of a probe armed with lint; and it has a double operation. The nitric acid acts imme- diately ; and when it has ceased acting, the slough contains a certain quantity of arsenic, which con- tinues to operate afterwards. On this occasion, as on many others on which you use nitric acid, without care, you will be in danger of burning the neighbouring textures. A woman who has warts on the pudenda wishes to have them destroyed, but she has no desire that the skin in the neighbourhood should be burned. This, however, will happen, unless you use means to prevent it. If you use nitric acid you should have at hand a solution of the bicarbonate of potash, by applying which you may neutralize the acid as it flows beyond the surface on which it is intended to act, and stop its operation. I may observe, here, once for all, that there are many occasions when it is necessary to use similar pre- cautions. Indeed, almost always, when you use a caustic, it is prudent to have some counter-agent at hand to stop its action if it reaches a sound part. Acids may be neutralized by alkalies ; caustic potash may be neutralized by vinegar, or by a

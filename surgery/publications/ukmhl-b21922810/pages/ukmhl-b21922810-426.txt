CHRONIC ABSCESS OF THE TIBIA. 410 lime. After compound fracture, when the patient has been long confined, the bones, in some instances, actually become as soft as a scrofulous bone, so that you may cut them with a knife.* The three last cases show that it is not safe to leave an abscess in the extremity of the tibia beyond a certain time ; that the joint is always in danger, and that the perforation of the bone is the only remedy. Even if you were mistaken in your diagnosis no harm can arise from the operation. Nay, it is a question whether good may not arise, under certain circumstances, from taking away a piece of bone, where it is affected with chronic inflammation, even though there be no abscess. The following very remarkable case will illustrate this last observation. A young gentleman, who lived at Brixton, was brought to me by Mr.Crowdy, surgeon of that place, with violent pain in the middle of one arm, the bone itself being enlarged in the part to which the pain was referred. Some remedies were tried, which I need not enumerate, without any benefit. The pain continued, and I began to suspect that there might be an abscess in the centre of the bone. Under this impression I proposed cutting down upon it, and making an opening with the trephine, so that I might give exit to the matter, if there were any there. The operation was performed; the trephine penetrated to the centre of the bone, but no matter escaped. * In the Dublin Medical Press for December 3, 1845, there is an interesting account by Mr. Kirby of a case of chronic abscess of the tibia, which well explains the ravages ultimately produced by this disease if it be not relieved by art.

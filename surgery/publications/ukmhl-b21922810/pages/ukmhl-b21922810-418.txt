She could not then stay in London ; and as her surgical attendant in the country did not accord with me in opinion, the operation was not per- formed. She dragged on a very uncomfortable existence for four years more. In the interval she # was married, travelled abroad, had various opinions, and tried different remedies, both here and on the continent, but obtained no relief Last August (1845) she again came under my care, the tibia being still further increased in size.

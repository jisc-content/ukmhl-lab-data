210 SCIRRHOUS TUMORS OF THE BREAST peritonaeum adhered to it, and that it was of a distinct scirrhous structure. The wound healed very well, and the patient went out of town. In the course of a little time, however, she returned to London, with another tumor formed in the cicatrix. She again put herself under Sir Everard Home.

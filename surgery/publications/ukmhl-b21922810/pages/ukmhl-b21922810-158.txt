SERO-CYSTIC TUMORS 142 of a globular shape, and evidently contained fluid. I punctured it with a grooved needle, and a yellow serum escaped. There were no other indications of disease. Afterwards I made a free opening into the cyst with a lancet, and the whole of the fluid having been evacuated, I introduced a piece of lint, with a view to produce inflammation and the formation of granulations on its inner surface, which might obliterate its cavity. An abundant suppuration and a good deal of inconvenience fol- lowed this trifling operation. At the end of about two months, although the abscess was not perfectly closed, the patient, believing herself to be nearly well, left London of her own accord. I heard nothing of her from this time until, after the lapse of about fifteen months, she again placed herself under my care. In the situation of the cyst which I had laid open there was a considerable solid tumor, a portion of which, of about half the size of an orange, projected through an opening in the skin, forming an irregularly shaped fungus. There seemed to be no other remedy that that of the removal of the breast by an operation, to which the patient willingly consented, and from which she recovered favourably.* On examining the tumor in its recent state some remains of the original membranous cyst, contain- ing a small quantity of serum, were found at its basis. A large quantity of solid substance pro- jected as an excresence from the inner surface of the cyst, assuming a peculiar plicated or fimbriated appearance, and a portion of this excrescence * I heard of this patient six years after the operation, and that she had continued well.

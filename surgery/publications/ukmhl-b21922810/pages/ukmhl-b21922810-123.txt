APPARENTLY CONNECTED WITH THE LIVER. 107 with a distinct fluctuation, and altogether very nearly resembling the tumor which existed in the case just related. In the following September it was determined, in a consultation between Dr. Chambers and myself, that I should puncture the tumor. Accordingly, a flat trocar was introduced below the margin of the ribs, and a pint and a half of watery fluid were drawn off. The wound healed by the first intention, without the smallest inconvenience arising from the operation. The boy left the hospital as cured, and I have had no opportunity of seeing or hearing of him since. The fluid drawn off was exactly the same in both of these cases. It was clear and colourless, resembling water in appearance. When exposed to heat in a spoon over the flame of a candle, no coagulation took place, and the fluid almost wholly evaporated, leaving the smallest possible residuum of animal matter. From the situation of these tumors, I was led to believe that they must have been connected with the liver; and this opinion is confirmed by the circumstance of my having not unfrequently noticed in dissection a membranous cyst, projecting on the convex surface of the liver, and containing a clear watery fluid. The cysts to which I allude are generally of the size of a marble. The largest which I have met with in the dead body may have contained from one to two ounces of fluid, but there is no reason why such a tumor, being once formed, should not attain any magnitude. Cysts which contain a serous fluid of a turbid

MORTIFICATION. 297 cellular membrane have begun to form, or where an infiltration of pus has begun to follow the infil- tration of serum, mere punctures will be insufficient. Incisions or scarifications will then be required ; and they should be of sufficient extent to allow the serum and pus to escape freely, and to relieve the tension of the skin. But they should not be more than this: first, because such painful opera- tions are a great shock to the nervous system 6f a person in vigorous health, and a very great one indeed to one who is weakened by previous dis- eases ; (and it is to be observed that this shock is not given to the system once for all, as, if the inflammation spreads, it may be necessary that the incisions should be repeated) ; secondly, because in proportion to the extent and depth of the incisions, is the danger of haemorrhage, the occur- rence of which, to any considerable extent, is sufficient to prevent the patients recovery. In making the incisions, you should always bear in mind that it is of vital importance that there should be as little haemorrhage as possible; and here you will find the advantage of having some active and intelligent assistants, who will carefully watch your lancet or scalpel, and whenever they see a vessel beginning to bleed, make pressure with the finger on it. Ligatures may be sometimes required, but not in general. The divided vessels, under these circumstances, bleed most profusely in the first instance, but they soon contract; and the pressure of the finger for a few minutes is usually sufficient to stop the haemorrhage altogether. The foregoing observations apply to all cases

72 EFFECTS OF STRANGULATION. take some blood from the arm, but it was not successful; and from the coldness of the surface of the body it was thought expedient to place him in a warm bath. During the night he continued to breathe, the stertorous breathing continued. In the morning a vein was again opened in the arm, and twelve ounces of blood were taken away, but no relief followed. He continued insensible, cold on the surface, and frothing at the mouth, and died at the end of twenty-four hours from the time of his having been cut down. The body was carefully examined. The vessels of the brain seemed to be turgid with dark- coloured blood, but there were no other morbid appearances. Dr. Latham has given me some particulars of another case a good deal similar to the last, but having a more fortunate result. A labouring man, with a family, had been drinking day after day until all his money was exhausted. After a nightâ€™s sleep he aw^oke sober, but to a sense of such desperate remorse that he went into a cellar and hanged himself. How long he had been hanging nobody knew ; but when he was cut down he was supposed to be dead. He was, however, only insensible, and in that state he was taken to the Middlesex Hospital, where he lay for a consider- able time insensible, and breathing with an apo- plectic stertor, but eventually recovered. * * After his recovery a phenomenon was observed similar to what occurs after injuries of the brain ; he had no recollection whatever of his attempted suicide.

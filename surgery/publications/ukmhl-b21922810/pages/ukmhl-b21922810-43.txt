27 THE MEDICAL PROFESSION* on pursuits of the highest interest, in which you will have the no small satisfaction of knowing that you never acquire any real advantage for your- selves which is not the consequence of your having benefited others. It is true that you have years of constant exertion before you; but you will even- tually learn how preferable such a situation is to that of those individuals who, born to what are called the advantages of fortune, but neglecting the duties of their station, believe that they can direct their minds to no more worthy object than the multiplication of their selfish enjoyments. It will not be your lot, as it is often theirs, to suffer the miseries of ennui, or to be satiated and disappointed with life at an early period; nor will you have to regret, as you advance in age, that you have lived unprofitable members of society. It is also true that you will meet with difficulties in your pro- gress ;—but there is no higher gratification than that of surmounting difficulties; and whenever they occur you will be cheered by the anticipation of that period when you may look on past events, and say to yourselves — “ Multa dies variusque labor mutabilis sevi Retulit in melius.”

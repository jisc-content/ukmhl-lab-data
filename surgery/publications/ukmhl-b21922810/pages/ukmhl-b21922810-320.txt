MORTIFICATION. 304 produce serous infiltration of the cellular mem- brane, and an oedematous swelling. The different kinds of dropsy depend on the same principle. Disease in the heart, impeding the circulation through it, gives rise to anasarca of the legs and dropsy of the pericardium and pleura. Disease of the liver, by obstructing the circulation through the vena portce, produces dropsy of the peritonoeum. But let us suppose that a ligature applied in this manner round the arm, were allowed to remain, so that the impediment to the circulation con- tinues. A low sort of inflammation would set up, the oedematous swelling and the tension would be aggravated, and might terminate in mortification. This is one kind of mortification from ligature. But let us suppose that the ligature is drawn tighter still; that it completely intercepts, not only the venous, but the arterial circulation. It is evident that the part below the ligature, being altogether deprived of that supply of scarlet blood which is necessary to the maintenance of vitality, must lose its vitality ; and this, then, is another way in which a ligature produces mortification. In the course of your practice you will meet with numerous cases illustrative of the different effects of ligature according to the degree of constriction which they occasion. Thus, a woman has a femoral hernia; a large portion of intestine is protruded through the narrow crural ring in the act of coughing; the ligature is as tight as pos- sible. Strangulation is complete. The arterial circulation, as well as the venous, is wholly obstructed. If you perform the operation for

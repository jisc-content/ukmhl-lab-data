MORTIFICATION. 310 or less emaciated. A man with a cushion of fat between the skin and the os sacrum, or the skin and the great trochanter, is in less danger of such mischief than another person. The explanation of this is sufficiently obvious. When you suspect that pressure on any part is so great as to be likely to occasion mortification, you can do nothing but remove the pressure. When a bandage is applied in a case of fracture, you must remove it as soon as you suspect that the swelling of the parts has increased the tension, lest mortification should follow. When a patient has been so long confined to his bed, that you expect mortification to take place, you should bear in mind that it is more easy to prevent it than to stop it when it has once begun. How, then, is this to be accomplished ? If a patient lies on his back, the skin sloughs over the os sacrum; if on one side, then it sloughs over the great trochanter. Endeavour, when he can manage it, to make him vary his posture. Let him lie at one time on his back; at another, on his side; nay, let him turn round, and lie occasionally on his face. If you have what they call a prone couch, properly constructed for the purpose, he may, in many instances, use it to great advantage. In one of the worst cases of this kind, when mortification had begun, I used to turn the patient on his face during many hours in the day, and with perfect success. But sometimes the patient cannot be shifted. There may be fracture of the thigh, and he must lie always on his back; you must then endeavour to take off the pressure

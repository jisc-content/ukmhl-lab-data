315 MORTIFICATION. pulsation was felt in it; and no one suspected that it was an aneurism. There was severe pain felt in the thigh, evidently arising from pressure on the anterior crural nerve, and the event proved that there was an aneurism, though it had not been indicated by the usual signs. It burst one day into the cellular membrane. The man screamed out as if he was being murdered, so horrible was the pain. The next day there was gangrene as high up as the groin, and death ensued in about a fortnight. On dissection, we discovered that an aneurism of the external iliac artery had burst under Poupartâ€™s ligament into the cellular mem- brane of the thigh. The extravasation of blood had prevented the circulation from being carried on in the limb; and, hence, it mortified. There was a patient in the hospital who had popliteal aneurism. I had fixed the day for tying the femoral artery; but, on the day previous to this, the aneurism burst into the calf of the leg, and the next day the limb was in a state of mortification ; so that, instead of tying the artery, I had to amputate the leg. The vessels below were all quite pervious, and the circulation would have gone on very well, but for the pressure produced upon them by the immense extravasation of blood. No doubt, in many cases of traumatic gangrene, this is the principal cause of the mortification. But traumatic gangrene takes place in another way; and, to illustrate what I mean, I will mention the circumstances of another case which occurred in this hospital some few years since. A poor boy was jumping over a ditch, and fell with consider-

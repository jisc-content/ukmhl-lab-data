As the costiveness has been relieved, and as the tongue has become clean, so has the pain in the face abated. A vast number of diseases depend on de- rangement of the digestive organs. You will meet with cases proving the truth of this observation daily; and that a patient should suffer from tic douloureux in consequence of a faulty condition of the digestive organs is not more remarkable than that he should have a sick headach from an over- loaded stomach, or an attack of lumbago from costive bowels.

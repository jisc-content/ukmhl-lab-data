MORTIFICATION. 326 bichloride of mercury, and one drachm of red oxide of lead. These are to be mixed together, kneaded with the fingers, and formed into a sort of paste. The paste should be rolled into little conical troches, and these, if left to dry, become hard, like what are called bread seals. These troches may be stuck into the enlarged gland like pins into a pin- cushion. In the course of a little time they begin to act, as the patient knows from the pain pro- duced. The pain lasts for some hours, and if a sufficient number of the troches be employed, the whole of the gland is at once destroyed. If any portion remains, it is easy to destroy it by repeating the process. I do not know whether the red-lead answers any useful purpose ; I suppose not; but I found it in the original prescription; and on all occasions where I find a particular prescription to do just what is wanted I am a little unwilling to alter it. Caustic may be applied to various morbid growths ; and I am inclined, on the whole, when these can be easily destroyed by caustics, to use them in preference to the knife; and for these rea- sons : first, the former are, on the whole, much less formidable to the patient; secondly, if I am not very much mistaken, there is less chance of any ill consequences from the application of caustic, than from even a small operation with a knife. For example, you very seldom find an attack of erysi- pelas follow the use of caustic ; certainly much less frequently than after the use of the knife. Again, the slightest wound in certain constitutions will be followed by that diffuse inflammation of the

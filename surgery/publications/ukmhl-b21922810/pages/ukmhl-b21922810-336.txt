320 MORTIFICATION. caustics have a manifest action on the dead body, it is not so with arsenic. I very much suspect that arsenic acts merely on the fluids, while ordinary caustics act on the fluids and solids also. However, I offer this to you as a conjecture, and as a matter deserving of further inquiry, and not as a well established fact. All other caustics which I have made the subject of experiment produce a distinct alteration in the condition of the dead body, though different in appearance from what they produce on the living, in which they operate on the fluids as well as on the solids, and in which the blood moving in the small vessels conveys their influence beyond the surface to which they are actually applied. A great variety of chemical agents may be employed as caustics. It would be an endless task for me to describe all of those with which I am myself acquainted, and even if I were to do so, a multitude of others would be left unnoticed, of which I have no experience. I shall only speak of those which we are in the common habit of employing, and the right use of which will, if I am not mistaken, enable you to accomplish all that can be accomplished in this way. There is some difference in the action of different caustics. Some act slowly, others rapidly ; some produce much pain, others comparatively little pain. The pain caused by some is very severe for a short time; that caused by others is less severe, but of longer duration. Some destroy a part to a much greater extent than others. The slough made by one kind of caustic will separate much

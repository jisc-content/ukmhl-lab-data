Parts may be destroyed by the application of various substances, which exercise a chemical action on the materials of which their organization is composed. We call these substances caustics, and sometimes escharotics. This is a subject of especial interest in practical surgery; and in con- sidering it I shall not confine myself to the modus operandi of caustics, but I shall extend my observations to the modes of using them, and explain some of the principal occasions on which you may, in the treatment of diseases, have recourse to them with advantage. I have no scruple in doing this, as I am not restricted by the rules of a systematic course of lectures, and need have no object in view, except that of making these discourses as useful to you as possible.

I make this observation, because it has appeared to me, that, while other

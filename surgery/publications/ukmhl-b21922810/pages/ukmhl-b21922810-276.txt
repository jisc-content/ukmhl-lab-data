260 TIC DOULOUREUX, OR FACIAL NEURALGIA. Treatment.—The treatment of tic douloureux, of course, must differ in different cases. In some instances it may be relieved by one method; in others, by another ; and I am afraid that we must acknowledge that in many cases it cannot be relieved at all. A very old operation, which had fallen into disuse, has been revived of late years— namely, that of dividing the trunks of the nerves, to the extremities of which the pain is referred. It has been said that if the pain be referred to the extremity of the second branch of the fifth pair of nerves, you should divide the second branch where it passes out of the infra-orbitary foramen on the face; that thus you will cut off the com- munication between the extremities of the nerve and the brain, so that the painful sensation may no longer be communicated to the sensorium. Now this would be very well if the seat of the disease were really in the extremity of the nerve; but there is no reason to believe that it is so, and there is every reason to believe the contrary. The irritating cause, whatever it may be, mani- festly acts not on the extremity of the nerve, but on its origin; and both reason and experience prove that the division of the nerves below the origin is of no service. I have myself performed this operation without the smallest benefit to the patient. In the late Dr. Pemberton’s case the branches of the nerves were divided by Sir Astley Cooper. Sir Astley did not recommend it, and, if my recol- lection be accurate, when Dr. Pemberton first applied to him to do it, he declined acceding to his

WHICH REQUIRE AN OPERATION. 211 life, if left to itself, in three or four years; never- theless, it often lasts much longer. I remember a lady of fashion, who had a scirrhous disease of the breast; who lived in the world, and nobody knew any thing about it for several years,â€”I believe ten or fifteen. I remember another lady who had a scirrhous tumor of the breast twenty-five years; and she died at last, not from the disease of the breast, but from effusion into the cavity of the chest. If you are doubting about the expediency of an operation, and the disease be in an indolent state, the recollection of such cases as these, where the patient has lived with a scirrhous tumor of the breast unaltered for many years, should be suffi- cient to incline you to reject it. The chance of a patient living long with such a disease is not such as should induce you to throw away the chance of an operation, where it is likely to be attended with advantage, but is sufficient to make you decline the having recourse to it, where other circumstances would lead you to doubt its propriety.

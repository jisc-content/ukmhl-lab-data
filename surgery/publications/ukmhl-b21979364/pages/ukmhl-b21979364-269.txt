229 CHAPTER XYI. CLEFT PALATE. The roof of the mouth, is formed by the fusion of the pala- tine processes Avith each other (and Avith the descending nasal process) in the middle line. The cleft of the soft and of the back of the hard palate is in the exact median line ; but at the front it passes outAvards through the midst of that half of the intermaxillary bone (Fig. 55). The inner part of each incisive bone, Avith the socket for the central incisor, is -A incisor teeth, c. The median pieces of intermaxillary bones are advanced upon the nasal septum towards the tip of the nose, as shown in Fig. 49. developed from the fronto-nasal process; the outer part, Avith the lateral incisor, is developed from the back of the nasal plate. Thus, according to Albrecht (Fig. 55), Avhen the palatine cleft extends into the lip, it passes betAveen the segment of the intermaxillary bone Avhich contains the central incisor and the segment containing the lateral incisor. This explains the fact that in double hare-lip the isolated bony nodule behind the prolabium contains but tAvo teeth, namely, the central incisors, the lateral incisors (if they have not been absolutely lost) being connected Avith the lateral maxillary process. Sometimes the uvula alone is fissured, or the defect may extend fonvard from it into the soft palate, or into the back of the hard palate, as is sIioavii in Fig. 56. With a single or double hare-lip the cleft

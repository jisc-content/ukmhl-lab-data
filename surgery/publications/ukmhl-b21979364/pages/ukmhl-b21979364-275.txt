235 OPERATION. vomit from the effects of the chloroform, the introduction of food into the stomach may be harmful. The best thing is to darken the room and let him sleep off the effects of the opera- tion. If he makes signs that he wants drink, a teaspoonful of water may be given. Probably, in this way twenty-four hours may be passed over. After this, small quantities of beef-jelly may be given in a teaspoon; it slips down easily, and is a clean sort of food. It is preferable to milk; it does not form curds in the stomach, as milk does, and it is, I think, more easily absorbed. If, when the feeding is begun, the child will allow the nurse gently to spray or syringe out the mouth into a basin, so much the better. But it is a mistake to irrigate if it frightens the child. As regards the fluid for irrigation, sanitas and water, or a very mild solution of carbolic acid or of Condy’s fluid, does well. In the course of a day or two a little sweetened orange-juice, chicken or meat which has been run through a fine sieve, bread and milk, or a soft custard pudding may be given. The stitches need not be removed unless they should be scratching the tongue; they will find their own way out. After operation, improvement in the voice is but gradual; it may be hurried on, however, by patient and methodical instruction, and, for further improvement, Fitzgerald, of Mel- bourne, advises massage of the palate and its muscles. The child should be shown the exact movement of the lips and tongue of the teacher when the difficult words are being pro- nounced, and he should be made to imitate these movements with care and diligence over and over again. A person accus- tomed to teaching deaf mutes would give very helpful instruction.* If the operation be performed late in childhood, the in- tonation is but sloAvly and partially improved; it is, therefore, Advisable to operate at as early a date as possible in every case. * See Haward’s paper in lancet, January, 18S7.

88 CHAPTER VI. SYPHILIS. Syphilis in childhood may be congenital or acquired. I have had under treatment a boy, of nine years, who had a Hunterian sore upon the prepuce and condylomata at the anus; he had received contamination from a girl of the same age. When secondary symptoms appear in a preco- cious child, it will be well to make an examination of the lymphatic glands in the groins, and of the parts associated with them. Inoculation may be received from a syphilitic wet-nurse; by kissing a syphilitic child or other infected person ; from an infected spoon or toy, or from careless vaccina- tion. The primary induration may have attracted little or no attention until the secondary symptoms appear. The course taken by acquired disease is like that seen in the adult. I have never met with a case of vaccino-syphilis. In Eng- land, where vaccination is performed with fair discretion, such cases very rarely occur; but should syphilis and cow-pox be inoculated together, the vaccine disease would have run its course, when the inoculation wounds become indurated and the axillary glands enlarged. Further confirmatory evidence of syphilitic infection is afforded after a few weeks, when roseola and other affections appear. In the case of hereditary disease, the taint may have been received from either parent, or from both parents ; in all cases, however, it is the same diseaseâ€”the double inheritance does not intensify the symptoms. After the parental disease has reached the tertiary form, it is improbable that infection will be transmitted. When suspicion is strong, but no direct confirmation is to be found in the child, it may be well to question the mother as regards premature confinements, miscarriages, or still- births ; to examine the brothers and sisters of the patient, and, if necessary, to have a private interview with the father.

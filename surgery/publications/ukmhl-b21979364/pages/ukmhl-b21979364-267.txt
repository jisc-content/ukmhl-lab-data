The raw tip of the new columna nasi may be implanted at the upper end of the interval between the approximated labial folds, and there sutured. Stitches must be applied not only down the front of the lip, but also on the dental aspect, so as to prevent the child putting his tongue into the wound, and to protect the raw edges from irritation by food. In a case in which this posterior set of stitches was omitted, I have seen the uniting medium between the halves of the lip of the mere thickness of the skin. Certain strong sutures, both at the front and back, should be inserted more deeply than the rest, so as effectually to prevent the halves of the orbicularis, and the associated muscles, dragging upon the wound. Prepared horse-hair may be used for adjusting the edges of the skin; horse-hair is very Fig. 53.—a, B, As before; c, d, e, Right side of labial cleft denuded of mucous membrane as far as angle of mouth. Fig. 54.—The two sides of the lip drawn together and secured by horse-hair sutures. useful also for securing the transplanted flap along the oppo- site halt ot the lip. The sutures at the front and back of the lip render the use ot steel pins quite superfluous. Indeed, I have long since given up the use of pins in the treatment of all forms of hare-lip. When the operation is completed, the new lip may look small, and the lower lip prominent; these conditions are inseparable from the operation upon a wide cleft. To remedy this, a wedge-shaped piece may be excised from the middle of

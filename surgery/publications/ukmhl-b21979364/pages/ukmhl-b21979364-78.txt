54 CHAPTER IV. HAEMOPHILIA—TUBERCULOSIS—RICKETS. HAEMOPHILIA. The hemorrhagic diathesis is an inherited defect; several members of the family may he vitiated by it. A boy with a constitution thus impaired was under treatment for a small contused wound of the scalp; only after a prolonged trial of styptics, and compression, did the bleeding cease. A brother of this boy had bled to death from a scratch of the finger. Haemophilia is a desperate complication in operative surgery; even such comparatively small matters as circumcision, the extraction of a tooth, the bite of a leech, or the division of the fnenum linguae, sometimes causing fatal haemorrhage. Haemophilia is far more common in boys; but the girls of a “ bleeder ” family, though rarely themselves the subject of persistent haemorrhage, are very likely to beget haemophihc male children; indeed, they are more likely to beget bleeders than are the males themselves. If a girl be haemophilic, she may be the subject of serious loss of blood at the oncoming of menstruation. As a rule, it is not a first or a second bleeding Avkicli causes fatal exhaustion, but the constant repetition of the attack. A boy may lose a large quantity of blood at a hsemophilic crisis without a fatal result, and, after bleeding has ceased, he may even make rapid progress towards an un- certain recovery. The attack may be preceded by headache and malaise. Sometimes the blood flows from the nose, the rectum, or the bladder; the gum is a frequent site for spon- taneous haemorrhage. Blood may form large collections in the subcutaneous tissue, the intermuscular spaces, or the articulations. Such hsemorrhaa'es differ from those of acute O rickets by their frequent recurrence as Avell as by their characteristic associations. Reference has been made to umbilical haemorrhage on page 271. Blood may Avell up through apparently sound skin, and, unable to coagulate, may

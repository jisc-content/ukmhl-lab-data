363 CHAPTER XXYI. BONE ANI) PERIOSTEUM. Acute septic osteomyelitis is one of tlie most serious diseases to be met with in children and young adults. Its diagnosis is not always easy at first, the affections for which it is mistaken being usually acute rheumatism and erysipelas, whilst some of the symptoms resemble those of typhoid fever. The disease usually begins at the end of a diaphysis, spreading in many cases through the whole of the dia- physis, and causing purulent effusion not only beneath the periosteum, but through the compact and cancellated hone and the medulla. Typhoid and scarlet fever, measles, influenza, bronchitis, fatigue, and exposure to wet and cold play an important part in preparing the child for the attack. Among the local causes are blows, sprains, and injuries of all sorts. And seeing how many poor and ill-nourished children there are who are forever exposing themselves to injuries, it is almost a matter of surprise that this infective ostitis is not more frequently met with. Probably the explanation of the comparative rarity of the disease is that, at the time at which the injury is received, the child’s blood-stream happens to be destitute of those particular micro-organisms whose seizure upon, and cultivation in, the bone constitute the disease in question. The micro-organism determining the disease is, for the most part, the staphylococcus pyogenes aureus; but streptococci are often, and the cocci of typhoid and of pneumonia are sometimes, in evidence. The staphylococci can be produced in gelatin from generation to generation, and when inoculated into one of the lower animals—especially if a bone has been prepared by injury—they produce again septic osteomyelitis. But in those instances in which injections of the cocci have not been preceded by injury to the bone, acute suppuration

230 CLEFT PALATE. may be confined to one half of the intermaxillary bone, as in Fig. 57. An infant may be brought for advice because, although it takes to the breast greedily, it is growing daily thinner. On examining the back of the mouth a cleft may be discovered implicating the soft palate and uvula. At first much of the fluid passes out through the nose; but if attention be paid to’the position given during the feeding (page 222), and if a giant teat be used, the muscles of deglutition soon grow accustomed to the defect, and improvement takes place. The voice is peculiar and unpleasant; if the child grow up with the defect unrelieved, speech is only partially intelligible, the letter S being altogether unpronounceable. With reference to operating, due regard should be paid to the aspect of the child, and to the general health. For if the edges of the palatine cleft do not adhere from the first, the tongue and the food find their way between them, and inflammation and suppura- tion ensue. The stitches cut their way out, and the mouth is left in a worse state than it was before, because the borders of the cleft are represented by scar-tissue. Failure to secure primary union is more serious than it is, for example, in ■ the treatment of a hare-lip. For a cleft-palate operation, the child must be in the very pink of con- dition. It is well to have him placed in the charge of the trained nurses for a few days before being operated on. Some children learn their first lessons in obedience in these cir- cumstances. Mr. Plimmer, who kindly examined some muco-pus after an unsuccessful operation for cleft palate, reported that the Fig! 57.—Complete palatine cleft extending forwards through the left intermaxillary bone, compli- cated with a double hare-lip.

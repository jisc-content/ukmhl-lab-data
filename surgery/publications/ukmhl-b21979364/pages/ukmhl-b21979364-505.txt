461 CHAPTER XXXIII. DISEASE OF THE ANKLE JOINT. Compared with the hip and knee, the ankle joint is rarely the seat of disease, as its mechanism renders it less liable to the effects of violence. If, however, it be severely sprained, a considerable amount, if not of blood, at least of altered synovia, is quickly poured into the interior of the joint. The treatment should be energetic and complete, lest, on the apparent subsidence of active symptoms, chronic inflam- mation or persistent weakness remain, or the invasion of tubercle bacilli be invited. The child should at once be put to bed and kept there for as long as necessary. The foot and ankle should be secured and gently compressed between gypsum splints. The foot should be fixed at a right angle, or else when the child begins to walk again he will be unable to get down his heel and the joint will be strained, because the weight is transmitted unevenly through it. Pressure and rest not only prevent the effusion of more fluid, but hurry on the absorption of that already poured out. Fomentations and lotions are not so efficacious in the treatment of the sprained joint as is compression. When the effusion has disappeared and the movements of the joint have become painless, the child may be allowed to use the foot; but even then and for some time afterwards, the part should be enclosed in gypsum or leather splints. The more delicate—potentially tuberculous—the child, the more need for care; but even for the most robust these measures should be adopted. How constantly is the answer to the question, “ Plow do you account for it ?” “ He sprained his joint some time ago, but we did not take much notice of it.” Tuberculous synovitis or arthritis being established, the skin becomes hot, the joint is slightly extended and is in- capable of painless movement. There is, moreover, a globular swelling at the ankle. The capsule is full and bulging and as the child walks he paddles himself along with his toe.

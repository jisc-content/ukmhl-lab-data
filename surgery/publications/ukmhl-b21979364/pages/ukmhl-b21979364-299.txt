On being fitted with the “ collar ” the pains ceased, and he grew fat. At the end of a year, though still wearing the support, he was in excellent condition. I fully endorse Dr. Scliapps’s opinion that traction applied by means of a head sling is particularly efficacious in cervical or high dorsal disease. To the rings of this is attached a cord, which passes over a pulley and is fastened to a weight. It is well to have several of these slings made of drilling and lined with flannel, and with straps of webbing. Figs. 64 and 65 show a form of headpiece which is easily made; it answers well when a light weight is to be used and the occipital projection is well developed; it has the merit of not interfering with the lower jaw. It consists simply of a piece of webbing an inch wide, a buckle, and two inch and a quarter iron harness rings. So long as the weight is pulling, the web has a good hold. After the ring has adjusted itself, the two layers of webbing are to be stitched together where they cross. A strap may be added to pass from ring to ring under the chin. It can be removed, so that the patient majr eat without intermitting the traction. The child is prevented from slipping upwards by the head of the bed being raised, or by weights being attached to the legs, as in hip-disease (Chap. XXIX.). The treatment of dorsal and lumbar caries by absolute rest is not always obtainable for poor children. The next best Fig. G4. Extension in Cervical and high Fig. Go. Dorsal Caries (Scliapps).

349 INFANTILE HERNIA. at tlie internal abdominal ring, whilst the tunica vaginalis and the funicular portion remain in free communication; an expulsive effort drives the bowel in a special sac, and into the open funicular process and tunica vaginalis. (See Lockwood, Trans. Soc. Med. Chir., 1886.) Case.—A weakly male child had a small, tightly strangu- lated hernia of the left side, reaching half way to the testis. The child was very ill; the hernia could not be reduced under chloroform. A diagnosis was made of “ congenital hernia,” but, on opening the sac, a second sac Avas seen; at the bottom of the opened sac ,X1 _ • . , ™ v , r -big. t>2.—Ovary with Twisted Pedicle lay the testicle. After a slight and (Edematous Fimbriae. use of the hernia knife, at the top of the tunica vaginalis, the contents of the small sac were returned without being exposed. On the eighth day death occurred from pneumonia; the preparation is in the museum of St. Mary’s Hospital (No. C. d. 20). (Fig, 83.) There is a second variety of infantile hernia, in which, the funicular process being closed at the abdominal end, a Fig. 83.—Encysted Hernia. T, Testis ; tv, Tunica Vaginalis.

It would then be necessary to cut through three layers of peritoneum before reaching the bowel (Fig. 84).

356 LATERAL CURVATURE. that she can diminish muscular fatigue by throwing her weight on the right foot, keeping the knee extended, and advancing the left foot, and slightly flexing the left knee. Thus she falls into the “ stand-at-ease ” position of the soldier. Deprived of its support, the left side of the pelvis drops, and the strain of keeping the body erect falls upon the right ilio-tibial band, the capsular ligament of the hip joint, and the articular processes of the vertebrae— tissues which are unconscious of fa- tigue. With the dropping of the left side of the pelvis the lumbar spine is inclined to the left, and, therefore, to bring the centre of gravity of the trunk over the basis of support, she inclines the dorsal region well over to the right, the head and cervical vertebrae inclining secondarily to the left. The dorsal curvature having the convexity usually to the right, the right shoulder is noticed to be “growing out.” The hip bone of that side is apparently “ growing out ” also; because by the inclination of the lumbar vertebrae to the left, the soft parts of the flank are carried away from the right iliac crest; at the same time the left hip bone is hardly distinguishable, being hidden under the inclined body (Fig. 85). The child who sits badly at school, on account, it may be, of faulty arrangement of form, or desk, or lighting, or because of defective sight, is apt to throw the chief part of her weight upon the left ischial tuberosity, and then, Avith the left hand upon the table and the elboAV hanging at the side, and with the right elboAV resting upon the table, the right shoulder is kept constantly raised and the loin region of the column inclined towards the left. In either sex lateral curvature may be secondary to in- fantile paralysis of spinal muscles, to collapse of lung tissue (page 156), or to obliquity of the pelvis from congenital dislocation of a femur, or some other form of shortening of a lower extremity, and it is often induced in a child by

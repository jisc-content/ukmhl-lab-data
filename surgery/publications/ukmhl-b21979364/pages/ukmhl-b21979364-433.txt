393 OF FEMUR. And if tliis be so, it should render us careful in keeping the child under constant supervision whilst he is Avearing splints; in taking them down from time to time to look at; in gently massaging the limb; and in being ever on the look-out for complaints of “ soreness ” Avhilst the part is hidden from sight. Some children appear to be extremely intolerant of all pressure and con- striction (see page 7.) Metacarpus.—The first meta- carpal bone is developed like a phalanx, the epiphysis being at its proximal end. A blow from a stick or a cricket-ball may detach the epi- physis, and the lesion may be mis- taken for a dislocation. The treat- ment for each injury is the same. A splint should be moulded on, and the hand should be worn in a sling. The femur may be fractured at the birth of the child, especially in a breech-presentation, and if the delivery be assisted by the blunt hook. Packard* quotes an instance in Avhich the femur had been fractured Avithin the uterus, and had become consolidated before birth. He also refers to a case in Avhich the leg doubled up as the child Avas simply walking across the floor, the thigh bone having given Avay in the middle of the shaft. Spontaneous fracture is more common in the femur than elseAvhere, by reason of the great leverage afforded by the length of the bone. There is, as a rule, no displacement at the seat of fracture, the line of which is transverse. There is, therefore, no shortening of the limb. Near the middle of the shaft a deep-seated and tender SAvelling may be detected—a SAvelling Avhich promptly folloAved an injury. Treatment.—For an infant at the breast, or in arms, it is sufficient to bandage the tAvo limbs together, from the feet and ankles up to the pelvis. A few stitches may be used for * Ashurst’s “Encyclopedia of Surgery,” vol. iv. p. 200. Limb much wasted. (From a Photograph taken bit Mr. Templeton.)

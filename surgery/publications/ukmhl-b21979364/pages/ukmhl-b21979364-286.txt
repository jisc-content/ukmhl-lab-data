246 CHAPTER XIX. SPINAL CARIES. It is incorrect to speak of spinal curvature as a separate disease ; it is but a symptom of disease, and may be due to general softness of the vertebrae, so that the column yields under the superimposed weight. It is also met with in rickets, and in the case of the girl who has outgrown her strength. In its most marked degree, however, it is generally the result of vertebral caries. (The differential diagnosis will be found on page 252.) Vertebral caries, or Pott’s disease, is a tuberculous ostitis, beginning in, and sometimes confined to, the body of a single vertebra, but more often spreading to the adjoining fibro- cartilages, and into a long series of vertebrae. Its starting- point is usually in the area of greatest physiological activity, between the body of the vertebra and its epiphyseal plate; the intervertebral discs, which are only secondarily invaded, may be eventually absorbed. Sometimes vertebrae in distant regions of the column are affected whilst the intervening bodies are apparently sound. Thus, in the same subject, tlie upper cervical and the lower dorsal, or the cervical and lumbar regions, may be diseased. The caries may co-exist with tuberculous disease of a joint, of lymphatic glands, or of the hand or foot, or of a long bone. It often follows scarlet fever or whooping cough, or some other exhausting disease. No child is too young to be the subject of vertebral caries. Vertebral caries is generally traceable to injury, such as a fall downstairs, from the bed, the perambulator, or the nurse’s arms. The traumatic disturbance of the part lowers its vitality, and thus renders it liable to attack by the bacilli of tubercle, for spinal caries is essentially a tuberculous disease, and in many cases there is a strong family history of tuberculosis. As the rarefying ostitis advances, the bodies of the

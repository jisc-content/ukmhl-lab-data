433 CHAPTER XXX. DISEASE OF THE SACRO-ILIAC JOINT. Sacro-iliac disease comes on insidiously after injury or exhausting illness in the tuberculous subject. Though it may thus be a primary affection, it is often secondary to disease of the spine, os innominatum, or hip joint; suppuration having taken place in or beneath the psoas or iliacus, the pus readily finds its way into the sacro-iliac joint. Symptoms.—The child complains of feeling tired after exercise, and of his back aching. He walks 'with caution, so as not to jar the diseased articulation ; he does not care to run. The pain may be constant and greatly intensified by a cough, a shake of the bed, or a stumble. The persistent pain may suggest spinal or hip disease, but in disease of the spine the pains are referred to the area of distribution of the nerves whose trunks pass by the carious region (page 249); in disease of the hip the first pains are in the knee or thigh (page 408). If, however, the trunk of the obturator nerve give a branch to the diseased sacro-iliac joint, there might be complaints of pain down the limb, or at the knee, as in hip-joint disease. As in hip-joint disease, also, the limb is wasted; but on squaring the pelvis no alteration in the length of the limbs is found. The limb assumes no characteristic position, but most probably lies extended ; moreover, if gently handled, it can be freely rotated in the acetabulum. The pains of sacro-iliac disease are sometimes ascribed to “ rheu- matism.” The buttock of the affected side begins to waste as soon as the pains come on. Points in the differentiation from spinal disease are the absence of symmetrical pains in the thighs and legs, the absence of stiffness, straightness, or deformity (page 248) in the lumbar region. The great feature in sacro-iliac disease is the localised tenderness. By tracing the iliac crest to the posterior iliac spines the finger detects a spot where pressure causes deep-seated pain.

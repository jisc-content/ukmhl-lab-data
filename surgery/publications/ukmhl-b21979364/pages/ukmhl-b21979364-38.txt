14 CHAPTER II. “ CROUP,” DIPHTHERIA, AND MEMBRANOUS LARYNGITIS. DIPHTHERIA. “ Croup,” diphtheria, and membranous laryngitis are forms of the same disease, produced by the reception and cultivation in the body of poisonous germs. The germ of true diphtheria is a bacillus. It was first discovered by Klebs; and subsequently Loeffler showed that pure cultivations made of this bacillus, when planted upon the throat-membranes of birds and guinea-pigs, produced genuine diphtheria. It was therefore called the Klebs-Loeftter bacillus. The bacteriologist readily discovers the bacillus, and its absence from cultures made from fresh pieces of membrane is usually taken as evidence that the case is not an ordinary diphtheria. The implantation of micrococci upon a faucial membrane produces a disease greatly resembling true diphtheria, and it is only by experi- mentation in the laboratory that the diagnosis of an obscure disease can be made with certainty. A highly fatal form of diphtheria is that in which pus-producing micrococci are mixed with Klebs-Loeffler bacilli. Evidently there are several varieties of diphtheria, and the absence of the Klebs- Loeffler bacillus must not be regarded as proof that an angina is not diphtheritic. A child sickened in my ward with what we thought was nasal diphtheria, and some of the discharge was sent to experts for examination. They could find no diphtheria bacilli. Nevertheless, the child was kept isolated and disinfected. Eventually returning to her home in Surrey, a serious outbreak of diphtheria occurred in her family, and under such conditions that the child had almost certainly brought in the infection. Membranous exudation in the windpipe may be produced by mechanical and chemical irritants apart from laryngeal diphtheria, and there is some evidence that membranous laryngitis has followed exposure to cold; but the more

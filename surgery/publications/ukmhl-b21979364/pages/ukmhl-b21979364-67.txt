43 OPERATION. trachea before opening it is due to the fact that there are strong fasciffl as well as fiat muscles in front of it, and that it is very easy to slit the fascia instead of the trachea, and then to thrust down the tube between the fascia and the trachea, with the result of still further impeding the intake of air. It is not difficult to lose the trachea when it is flattened beneath the finger, or drawn aside by a clumsy assistant. The blade of the thermo-cautery is not suited for the operation; it makes the wound so hot, and its edges so hard, that the finger cannot be used as a guide, and the resulting eschars may be cast off with serious haemorrhage. As soon as the trachea is opened, air rushes up through the blood, and the anxiety of the operator diminishes. Forthwith the dilator (Fig. 1) is passed into the wound ; the blades are separated; the child coughs out blood and mucus, and the tube is introduced between the blades of the dilator. The spasmodic respiration at once quiets down, air passes through the tube, and breathing is so peaceful (such a change after the late noisy respiration) that a stranger to the process might think that the quiet betokened death. Colour returns to the face. The pulse improves. Thick mucus is driven into the tube, and is removed by a feather or a camel-hair pencil, and shreds of false membrane are perhaps coughed out or extracted with forceps. If, when the tube has un- doubtedly been inserted in the windpipe, air does not pass readily through it, even when artificial respiration is resorted to, the probability is that the end has slipped down between the tracheal wall and the mucous lining, or else beneath a cast of diphtheritic membrane. In such circumstances the tube must be withdrawn, the tracheal wound enlarged, and • • u ^ the mucous lining incised, or the false membrane extracted by forceps. 1 he tube which, in my opinion, best answers the various requisites is of metal, and consists of an outer and an inner

SACRAL DIMPLE. 245 being made for imperfect development of the lumbar spine. Later in life, the defect is not infrecpiently associated with perforating ulcer of the foot. Sacral dimple.â€”Where the fusion of the lateral halves of the body has been imperfect, a dimple may persist in the skin of the middle line of the sacral or coccygeal region. Such a dimple is often associated with spina bifida. Should the depression extend still more deeply, it might in time become separated from the skin and remain as a closed sac beneath it; then, collecting epithelial elements in its interior, it would constitute a dermoid cyst. Dermoid cysts are often met with in this neighbourhood. Some- times the dimple persists as a coccygeal fistula, discharging sebaceous matter or fluid.

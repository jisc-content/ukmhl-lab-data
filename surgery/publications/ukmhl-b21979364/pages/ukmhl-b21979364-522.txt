To treat it by simply thickness of the dieel of the boot is to obtain but specious relief, and to prevent the proper development of the heel, the foot, and the entire limb. Deformity as the result of infantile paralysis may often be improved, up to a certain point, by operative measures which comprise the removal of the articular cartilage from the elbow, knee, or ankle, so as to render a useless joint solidly fixed, and so that the lower part of the limb may thus be placed under the control of muscles like the deltoid, triceps, and biceps— ilio-psoas and glutei—which have re- tained all, or most of their vigour. Possibly, after thus getting the tibia synostosed and in a straight line with the femur, the tender and useless foot may be advantageously removed by Syme’s method, the natural peg limb being afterwards furnished with an artificial foot. A hopeless flail-limb is often best treated by amputation through the thigh. (See “ Arthrodesis,” page 166.) A paralytic limb, however, does not lend itself to highly successful treatment. When the leg, for instance, is affected, it is wasted and cold, and the skin is liable to patchy congestion and ulcerations. The deformity after paralysis is due to permanent shortening of the affected muscles or to unopposed contraction of the opposite group ; the foot is extended or in- verted, perhaps both; horn}" patches may be formed upon the skin, wherever unequal pressure is received; the child swings the foot in a characteristic manner. He may even walk on the dorsum of the foot. The elevation of the heel after infantile paralysis is due to an atrophic shortening of the unopposed muscles rather than to a physiological contraction. If the muscles on the front the leg be paralysed, so that the posterior group are unopposed in their action upon the extension and inversion of the foot, the tendons may be dealt 117 —Splay feet, from Paralysis of Inner Tibial Muscles.

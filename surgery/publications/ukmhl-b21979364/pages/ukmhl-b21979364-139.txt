103 CHAPTER VII. ENLARGEMENT OF LYMPHATIC GLANDS. Enlargement of lymphatic glands may be due to local or constitutional causes. Usually it is determined by local irritation; and, in the case of a tuberculous or unhealthy child, a trifling irritation may give rise to a disturbance in the lymphatic gland which is serious out of all proportion to the local lesion. Thus, a tuberculous diathesis predisposes the child to suppuration on the occurrence of local irritation; but every glandular abscess in an unhealthy child is not necessarily tuberculous—many of them are septic. A chain of glands (glandulse concatenatse) extends along the deep surface of the sterno-mastoid. Should one gland be infected, others may become involved, even though the primary source of irritation may long since have healed. When it is impossible to determine the exact cause of the disturbance, one is too apt to suppose that the glandular enlargement is a primary affection. It is likely that, the child being tuberculous, a slight lesion commenced the disease. A common cause is irritation of the pharyngeal mucous mem- brane by sewer gas, the fauces being found congested or inflamed; but all trace of irritation may have passed entirely away before advice is sought for the “ lumps.” In every case the throat should be inspected. On one occasion,* children from three different families in a district where a sewer had been emitting volumes of foul air were under treatment for cervical abscess. In one of these families the children were markedly tuberculous. Had not the existence of the neigh- bouring sewer-ventilation been known, we might have regarded the glandular enlargement as an independent manifestation of tuberculosis, no definite lesion about the pharynx or elsewhere being discoverable. A follicular abscess, which has long since healed, may have set up glandular enlargement throughout the whole neck of * Lancet, Aug. 3, 1878.

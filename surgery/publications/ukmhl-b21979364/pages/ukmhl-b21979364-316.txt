FISS UllA ABDOMINALIS. 276 In these circumstances the administration of repeated doses of rhubarb and soda, together with careful dieting and super- vision, may effect all that is needed. But when the causes of the rupture are obscure, when no clear “ indications ” for treat- ment are discoverable, when the abdominal aperture is large, and the flat pad and strapping have failed, a radical operation may be not only justifiable but necessary. The operation consists in making a semi-elliptical incision on each side of the protrusion and down to the sac. The contents are then returned to the abdomen, and the sac is dissected away. The edges of the aperture are then brought together by sutures, which should traverse the borders of the recti as well as the skin and the peritoneum. Should an umbilical hernia be irreducible, the radical treatment should be resorted to, and still more urgent would the need be if the hernia were strangulated; but this is very unlikely to occur. Fissura abdominalis.—When the abdominal walls fail to meet along the middle line, the visceral cavity being closed in only by thin membrane, all the coils of intestine may pro- trude, has in early foetal life, from xiphoid cartilage to pubes Fig. 67.—Fissura Abdominalis, with Extroversion of Viscera. (From a Photograph lent by Dr. Elliott of Tunbridge Wells.) (Fig. 67). This defect may be due to retroflexion of the foetus, a position which lessens the capacity of the chest and abdomen. I have seen various degrees of this deformity; all that one can do is carefully to protect the film which covers

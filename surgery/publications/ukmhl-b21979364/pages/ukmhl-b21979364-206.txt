PSEUDO-HYPERTROPHIC PARALYSIS. 166 necessary. As the child lies in bed, the weight of the clothes should be removed from the toes by a cradle, so as to prevent over-ex tension. Arthrodesis (apOpov, “joint”; Sew, “ to fix”).—When the muscles of one part of a limb are left functionless, whilst those of another part are serviceable, great advantage may be derived from removal of the cartilages of the intervening joint and securing its solid ankylosis. Thus, a withered and deformed leg may be brought under the control of the muscles of the thigh and ren- dered useful for progression. Both knees may be straightened and so fixed at the same time, and elbows, ankles, and tarsal joints may be similarly dealt with, as circumstances direct. Pseudo - hypertrophic muscular paralysis. — The adjoining figure (Fig. 28), taken from a patient at the Children’s Hospital, shows some of the characteristic features of this disease. The calves and buttocks are enlarged, the hypertrophy is sym- metrical, and there is an arching of the loins. Microscopic examination proves that the increased size of the muscles is due to a general development of connective tissue be- tween the fibres, the muscular elements themselves being diminished. The boy (the subjects are generally boys) is perpetually falling about. He steps along like a bare-footed bather descending a shingly beach, and endeavours to preserve his balance by keeping the legs wide apart, and by throwing out the arms (Duchenne). The heels being drawn up, he walks much on his toes, and cannot stand firm. The shoul- ders are thrown back, in order to render the equilibrium more stable. Thus, arching of the loins is produced, but it disappears when he lies down. The weakness of the gluteal muscles renders the act of getting up from the floor Fig. 28. — Pseudo-hypertro- phic Paralysis ; enlarge- ment of deltoids, buttocks, and calves.

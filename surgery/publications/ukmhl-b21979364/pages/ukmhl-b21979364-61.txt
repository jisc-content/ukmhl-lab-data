37 LARYNGISMUS STRIDULUS. infants are far more liable to laryngismus than those brought up at the breast. Occasional small doses of rhubarb and soda are useful; counter-irritation is of doubtful value. The atmosphere of a hot room is depressing. The infant should be taken out of doors daily, no matter how cold the air may be. If, however, a child be liable to bronchitis, he should be kept indoors when the weather is unusually severe. When the child cannot be taken out of doors the air of the rooms in which he lives must be always kept fresh by thorough ventilation. Cod-liver oil by the mouth or by the skin may be tried, and bromide of potassium in doses of four grains and upwards. With the bromide small doses of chloral may be given. If the infant be unconscious, convulsed, or cyanosed, he may be placed in a warm foot-bath, while cold effusions are used for his head and neck. After the bath he may be found to breathe better sitting. The inhalation of a little vapour of chloroform will be required if the attacks of spasm are severe. If, after a crisis, the child be found apparently dead, the medical man should at once set about the performance of artificial respiration by slow, alternating pressure of the hand, and relaxation, upon the chest walls.

HARE-LIP. pared off, tlie lateral halves of the lip are brought forwards to the middle line; this could not be done, however, unless their connections with the superior maxillse had been thoroughly torn through. When the left half of the lip is thus brought inwards, the incision, A B, which has been made obliquely into the lip, becomes vertical; the thick flap, which was previously vertical, becoming horizontal, so as to form the prolabium and the mucous border of the restored lip, as depicted in Fig. 52. The right side of the lip being drawn inwards, some of its freshened border, C D, lies vertically in the middle line, whilst the rest of it, D E, forms a horizontal edge to which the deflected flap from the left half of the lip is then adjusted, the middle part being so arranged as to fit into the retiring angle on the left side, as is shown at B, in Figs. 53, 54. As a rule, the flap is long enough to reach quite up to the commissure towards which it is reflected, so that it saves time if the operator thinly peels off the mucous surface in the short horizontal part of the lip as well as in the vertical part. The pink membrane must be entirely removed, for if any of it be left, primary union at that spot is impossible. Not a particle of skin, however, should be sacrificed. The diagrams by which I have endeavoured to represent the scheme of the operation fail to show a puckering which often occurs, at B, when the vertical flap is brought across in the horizontal plane, which can be remedied by continuing the end of the incision, A B, a little outwards through the Fig. 51.—Double Hare-lip, the prolabium and incisive bone having been removed.

ABSCESS ABOUT RIB. 377 in the side; and, on examining, local tenderness may be found about a rib. The sooner that the abscess is opened and scraped out the better, lest, perchance, more ribs become affected, or the pus find its way into the pleural cavity. Tuberculosis is the cause of these abscesses, and, in examining them, the surgeon should satisfy himself that the spine moves freely, and that the pus is not tracking its way from a vertebral caries. If, when operating on the abscess, it is found that the pus is connected with a roughened area on the deep aspect of the rib, it is advisable to resect that piece of the bone, after detaching the periosteum, and then thoroughly to scrape the granulation-tissue from the walls of the cavity, and to clean it out with dossils of sterilised gauze.

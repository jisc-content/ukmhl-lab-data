CONGENITAL HERNIA. 348 sound in the inguinal region, • and there was no history of his having had any other protrusion than that at the navel. Congenital hernia is that variety in which the bowel passes along the open funicular process into the tunica vaginalis. (See remarks on congenital hydrocele, page 33S.) Though often found at, or soon after, birth, its appearance may be delayed for weeks, or even years. Frequently it exists with congenital hydrocele, when, on the bowel being returned into the abdomen, the serous fluid can be made to follow it by raising the scrotum. Sometimes the bowel descends only a short way along the funicular process, when, if there be no hydrocele, it may be im- possible to recognise the exact variety of the hernia—a matter of but little prac- tical importance, however (Fig. 81). Congenital hernia may occur in girls as well as in boys; in the former the intestine drops into the funicular process which passes down with the round ligament—the canal of Nuck ; in one child the ovary had thus descended as a hernia on each side of the body. Hernia of the ovary with torsion of the pedicle.—Cases Fig. 81. — Congenital Hernia. T, Testis. of this extraordinary affection in infants have been published in the British Medical Journal, June 13th, 1896, and in the Lancet, March 21st, 1S96. They bear. a close re- semblance to cases of torsion of the spermatic cord. In Fig. 82 is shown the twisted pedicle and the oedematous ovary removed in one of the two reported cases. In funicular hernia the bowel has descended along the open tube of peritoneum, but on account of obliteiation of the process having already taken place just above the testicle, it has not, as in the congenital variety, passed into the tunica vaginalis. This is a common variety of hernia in children. Infantile, or encysted hernia, is of rare occurrence; its exact nature could hardly be recognised, except on opeiating. The tubular prolongation of peritoneum has been obliterated

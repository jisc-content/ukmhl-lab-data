OF RADIUS AND ULNA. 35)1 sure to suffer temporarily from adhesive synovitis. Roughly to move the joint might be to wreck it completely. Stiff- ness in childhood almost certainly works off in time, unless a fracture seriously damaged the joint. Sir James Paget wrote that happily “ bone-setters ” are allowed to have but little practice among children. Happily; for children’s joints are much more imperilled by violence than those of older patients. Fracture of the radius and ulna may be incomplete. The bones may require straightening before the splint is applied. The limb should be evenly bandaged from the hand upwards, and enclosed in plastic splinting. Wooden splints are in- convenient for children. For about three weeks the apparatus should be worn, and for the first few days it will be convenient to keep the child in bed, with the arm raised upon a pillow. Traumatic effu- sion is much better treated by even compression and by gentle massage than by lotions. If wooden or tin splints are used, they must be padded and adjusted with great care, and the child must be kept under close supervision, as pressure, tightness, or unevenness is very apt to cause sloughing and suppuration. The radius.—Fracture may take place through the lower epiphyseal cartilage, from a fall upon the outstretched hand; the symptoms are similar to those of Colies’s fracture, but, from the squared direction of the separation, malposition of the fragment is likely to occur. Such an injury may interfere with the due growth of the bone (Fig. 96). The head of the ulna is rarely detached. In the event of an injury to the lower end of the ulnar diaphysis causing arrest of its growth, whilst the radius continues to be developed, either the hand is thrust into the position of extreme adduction, or else the head of the radius Fia — Arrest of Development of Radius caused by Injury to Lower Epiphysis.

97 SYPHILITIC KERATITIS. each may be studded over with fine, separate dots. 1 ie passage of blood-vessels through the inflamed cornea causes the appearance of pink streaks or “ salmon-patches,” which are nearly always associated with photophobia or lachry- mation. Under mercurial treatment, the cloudiness quickly fades away, though frequently a slight opacity persists. Syphilitic keratitis is hardly ever followed by ulceration, and it differs from the keratitis of tuberculosis in being interstitial and not superficial. Iritis is not a common symptom. It may occur at any time between early in- fancy and late childhood and, passing away, may leave the iris adherent and irregular. The symptoms are often so slight as not to attract attention. Deafness, which is not a common symptom of here- ditary syphilis, may be the result of an inflammatory thickening of the middle ear or Eustachian tube, or of -cicatrisation of ulcera- tions at the aperture of the tube. Or it may be due to disease of the auditory nerve or its terminal fila- ments ; such deafness is in- curable. Deafness may come on with the keratitis distance.

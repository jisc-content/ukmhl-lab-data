PRIMARY SARCOMA. 115 serious constitutional malady. And unfortunately the diag- nosis of simple from malignant lymphoma is, in the early stage of the disease, impracticable. Iron and arsenic in small and oft-repeated doses may be given. Operation may be required if the gland-masses cause dyspnoea, either from pressure against the side of the larynx or tracheae, or from pressure directly upon the front of it. The child is liable to sudden spasm, which may prove fatal. Tracheotomy may be demanded. The operation may be long and difficult; it should be performed cautiously, and an unusually long tracheotomy-tube will be needed. If it be thought inexpedient to undertake a tracheotomy for the dyspnoea, some temporary relief to pressure may be afforded by division of the deep cervical fascia. Inasmuch as the glands are diseased in various parts of the body, enuclea- tion of the cervical masses is not to be thought of. Primary sarcoma of glands.—Fig. 17 represents a lympho-sarcomatous tumour. It reached from the ear to the clavicle and the episternal notch, and, laterally, from the median line of the neck to the border of the trapezius. It had a semi-solid feel; it did not implicate the skin, and it was freelv movable. It was situ- «/ ated beneath the sterno - mastoid, taking there its origin in the lymph- atic glands. Its great size and rapidity of growth betokened its malignant nature, and suggested prompt removal. Accordingly, it was exposed b}^ a free incision, and enucleated. The common carotid artery and the pneumogastric nerve were found to occupy a deep groove in its substance, whilst the internal jugular vein was stretched over its surface a little farther back. The vein had to be sacrificed, and it was accordingly tied above and below. The operation being completed, the wound was closed with a continuous suture, and the infant was put back in his cot with his head between sand-bags. Sections of the

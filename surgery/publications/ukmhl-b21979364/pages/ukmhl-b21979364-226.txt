Development.—The first that is seen of the buccal cavity is a wide cleft beneath the fronto-nasal process; laterally it is bounded by the maxillary processes, and below it the mandibular plates are advancing towards the middle line. The fronto-nasal and the maxillary processes are at this time separated by a fissure which extends from either side of the mouth into the orbit (Fig. 38). Atresia oris.—At birth the mouth has in rare instances been found com- pletely closed. Cooper Forster described a case in which the mouth was found so small as only to admit a full-sized bougie. To this deformity the term microstoma congenitum is given, the fusion between the maxillary and mandibular processes having been overdone. The treatment is to bring a flap of the mucous membrane over the freshly cut lip surface, and there fix it by fine sutures. To diminish the risk of closure by cicatrisation after operation, the mucous membrane should be drawn over the raw surface and sutured to the skin—edge to edge. Constant di- latation may be required to maintain the size of the opening. The small mouth is not necessarily a congenital defect; it may be caused by the puckering and contraction which follow syphilitic ulcerations (Fig. 39) or burns. The child being in a good state of health, a plastic operation on the principle described above may be undertaken, but the outlook is not favourable. Fig. 39.—Cicatricial Con- traction of Mouth.

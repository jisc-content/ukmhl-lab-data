FRACTURE THROUGH LOWER EPIPHYSIS. 387 completely disappear within a few months of the arm being released. If, when all swelling has subsided, union be taking place with some deformity, the surgeon should think twice before breaking it down with the idea of readjusting the ends. Such interference might result in fracture of the bone in a fresh place, or might be followed by serious local disturbance. Nature may be trusted to effect a marvellous improvement in the course of time. Union of an epiphysis is, as a rule, quickly effected, so that the parts should not be fixed for more than three or four weeks; they should then be allowed complete freedom. If Tig. 91.— Fracture through Lower Fig. 92.—Dislocation of Radius and Epiphyseal Cartilage. Dina backwards. the arm be kept longer in the bandages, the stiffness is slower in working oft. Exercises and massage expedite the useful- ness of the limb, and the}'- may be resorted to before the arm is entirely restored to freedom. Fracture through the lower epiphysis of the humerus is apt to be mistaken for dislocation at the elbow joint. I he epiphyseal cartilage passes horizontally just above the condyles, the trochlea, and the capitellum. These portions of the humerus have separate centres of ossification, and (with the exception of the internal condyle) coalesce to form an epiphysis which is united to the shaft in the sixteenth or seventeenth year. (The internal condyle joins with the shaft in the eighteenth year.) (See Fig. 90). The fracture is most likely caused by a fall upon the

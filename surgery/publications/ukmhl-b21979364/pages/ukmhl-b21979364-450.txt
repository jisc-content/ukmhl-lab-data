410 HIP-JOINT DISEASE. squared, the amount of the fixed flexion becomes manifest. So as to be certain that the loins and pelvis are flat and square, the sound thigh should be fully flexed upon the chest, the aflected limb being slowly and carefully raised at the same time, the relative position of the articular surfaces being- kept absolutely undisturbed. When this has been done the precise amount of flexion and adduction is shown (Fig. 102). Any apparent shortening is then explained away, and, moreover, a limb which hitherto might have been considered in good position may he found of normal length, but greatly flexed and adducted. Fig. 103 represents (a) normal pelvis and lower ex- tremities seen from the front, and (b) disease of left hip joint, pelvis tilted and left limb apparently shortened but in the normal line; (c) shows pelvis squared, and the limb, Fig. 102.â€”Sound thigh flexed on abdomen for ascertaining exact amount of deformity. being brought down, found greatly adducted, yet of normal length; (d) represents disease of left joint, the pelvis having been tilted (possibly dropping from want of accustomed sup- port), so that the left extremity seems lengthened, though still in normal position. But, on bringing transverse line of iliac crests at right angles with spinal column as in (e), the left limb is found of normal length, but greatly abducted-

DERMOID CYSTS. 127 mouth. They also occur in the middle line of the chin, and on the nose. At the root of the nose the dermoid has to be diagnosed from meningocele (page 174). The only satisfactory way of treating dermoids is by dissection. Dermoid cysts of the ovary are of congenital origin, but at any time after puberty they may begin to grow. Some- times their development takes place much earlier. Thus, Dr. Fig. 20.—Face of an Embryo of 25 to 28 days, showing the Branchial and other Clefts where Epiblastic Inclusion is apt to occur. 1, Frontal prominence ; 2 and 3, Olfactory fossse ; 4, Mandibular arch; 5, Maxillary tubercles ; 6, Oro-nasal cavity ; 7, 8, and 9, Branchial arches, with clefts intervening ; 10 and 11, Ocular and auditory vesicles. (From Gray's “Anatomy.”) Roemer successfully removed a dermoid ovarian cyst, of the size of a child’s head, from an infant of twenty months; in several instances dermoid cysts have been removed from children two or three years old. Cysts about the orbit are often very firm. They are usually dermoid, and are caused by a piece of epiblast being detached, belated, and locked in the depths of a closing developmental fissure—like a fly in a piece of amber. They preserve their vitality, and proliferate epidermal scales which degenerate into a pultaceous mass. In the neighbourhood of the orbit they lie beneath the orbicularis, and, on being

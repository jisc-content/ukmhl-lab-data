sinks under it. During the separation of the slough blood- poisoning is apt to set in. The result as regards ultimate deformity by cicatrisation compares favourably with that left after cancrum oris, the lax and abundant tissue in the pudendal region being slowly drawn up to obliterate the gap left after the separation of the slough. Should ulceration implicate either commissure â€¢of the vulva, or the adjacent margins of the aperture, careful dressing is demanded. Should a partial atresia supervene, a plastic operation might be required later.

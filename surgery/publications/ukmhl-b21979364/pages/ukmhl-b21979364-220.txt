180 COLOBOMA OF EYELID. growing across the fissure, whilst, more deeply, the edges are glued together by the secretion of the Meibomian glands. In kittens the eyelids adhere for a week or so after birth, but in the human subject the lids separate before the end of intra- uterine life. Occasionally the child is born with the lids still joined together. In certain cases the upper lid is formed from two in tegumental processes instead of one ; and if the two buds fail to unite in the vertical line, coloboma is pro- duced, after the manner of hare-lip. In the operation upon the child shown in Fig. 37, the edges of the cleft were pared and then adjusted by horse- hair sutures, some of which passed through the tarsal cartilage. Primary union occurred. The child Avas a patient of Dr. Keser’s. Wry neck. — The cause may be an awkward position of the foetus in utero ; a partial tearing of the sterno-mastoid during labour; irritation set up by spinal caries (page 252); inflammation of cervical vertebrae from wet or cold ; glandular inflammation or suppuration; central irritation of the brain or spinal cord, and contraction of the cicatrix after a burn. During the birth of the foetus, either from the force of the expulsive efforts, or from the traction exerted upon the feet by the medical attendant or midwife, the sterno-mastoid is partially ruptured Avithin its sheath, blood being extravasated betAveen the tom ends. But the swelling in the sterno-mastoid may be met Avith in infants Avhose entrance into the world lias been so easy that neither nurse nor midAvife had the oppor- tunity of assisting. The rupture of the muscle probably occurs from a tivist of the neck, rather than from over-extension. In the fat-necked infant, the tumour may pass unnoticed for days or Aveeks; as the neck groAvs, the swelling attracts .attention. It may exist in the sternal or the clavicular Fig. 37.-—Coloboma of Eyelid.

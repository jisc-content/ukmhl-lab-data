I viii THE SURGICAL DISEASES OF CHILDREN. The author begs to express his thanks to the artists for the care which they have given to the illustrations, and to Mr. George Templeton, Surgical Registrar to the Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street, for supervising the proof - sheets, and for many useful suggestions. Advantage has also been taken of many valuable notes which Dr. 0. Laurent, of Brussels, inserted in the French translation which he made from the second edition of “ The Surgical Diseases of Children.”

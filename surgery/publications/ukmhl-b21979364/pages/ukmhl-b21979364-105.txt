73 “SCURVY” RICKETS. The surgeon may wonder at first if the case is one of broken bone, of septic ostitis, or of cellulitis. Sometimes both legs are affected. In some instances the epiphysis is detached from the shaft. (A fine cannula and trochar thrust into the swelling would find the bone bare, and on withdrawal of the trocar a drop or two of dark blood would escape, but no pus.) As D’Arcy Power says, the chronic nature of this disease and the absence of the signs of septic infection distinguish it from osteo-myelitis (Chap. XXVI.). Ashby does not accept the theory of “ scurvy ” in this condition, but regards the sponginess of the gums and the haemorrhages as expressions of the extreme anaemia of acute rickets. For my own part, I avou!d by no means insist on the retention of the term “ scurvy ” rickets. I would be content with the adjective “ haemorrhagic.” The association of the Avord “• scurvy,” hoAvever, is advantageous in that it at once suggests the appropriate line of treatment. Treatment.—Recovery takes place under the influence of cleanliness, Avarmth, fresh air, neAv milk, cod-liver oil, SAveet- ened orange juice, beef juice, and fresh vegetables. For the swollen limb, elevation, gentle massage, and dry compression are useful, Avith appropriate splinting. Small doses of quinine and iron may be administered; no active surgical treatment, or exploration, is required. Under the improved hygiene, the blood clot is steadily absorbed; the periosteum resumes its connection ; detached epiphyses again adhere to the shaft; the sAvelling of the limb disappears, and the child completely recovers. The child should not be shut up in a dark, stuffy room, but should be got out into the fresh air as much as possible.

Fig. 41.â€”Macroglossia, (From a Photograph lent by Ur. Leah of Plymouth.) Macrocheilia is an unsightly hypertrophy of the lips due to dilatation of the lymph spaces; the adjacent parts of the cheeks may also be affected, and the veins may be en- larged after the manner of a mevus. Acute glossitis causes the tongue rapidly to swell: the impressions of the teeth are found around its sides and tip. If the condition be associated with extreme dyspnoea, incisions may be required along the dorsal aspect. Possibly, even, tracheotomy may be demanded, especially if the swell- ing be accompanied with oedema of the mucous membrane about the epiglottis and larynx. The child needs constant watching. An astringent mouth-wash, and free purgation are required.

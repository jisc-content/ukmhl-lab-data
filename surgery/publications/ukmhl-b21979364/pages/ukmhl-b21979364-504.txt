ONYCHIA MALIGNA. 460 intellectual deficiency. Mere division of the web does not suffice, for, careful as the subsequent dressing may be, and widely as the fingers may be kept apart during the progress of granulation, reunion is sure to occur through a greater or less extent. A successful operation has been devised by Mr. A. T. Norton*:—A dorsal and a palmar flap of skin and subcu- taneous tissue, of about half the size of one’s finger nail, are dissected up at the level of the heads of the metacarpal bones. This being done, the web is divided, and the flaps are adjusted across the cleft by fine sutures. Primary union taking place between these flaps, adhesion of the contiguous borders of the fingers is effectually prevented. For a few days the hand should be fixed on a splint and worn in a sling. This operation, which I have practised a great many times, is, in my opinion, far superior to any other. The crescentic flaps must be cut long enough to meet easily across the cleft, yet not so thin as to run the risk of sloughing. If the flaps unite by first intention—-which they usually do— the case progresses without trouble or anxiety. Onychia maligna is the result of acute inflammation of the matrix of the nail. It usually follows an injury to the end of the finger in a child in broken health. The sore is highly septic, and is best treated by removal of the loosening nail (under an anaesthetic) and by weak mercuric lotions; the hand should be secured upon a splint. If there is a suspicion of the child being the subject of congenital syphilis, he had better be treated by mercurial inunction. In any case, cod- liver oil and iron and a good hygiene are needed. Polydactylism.—If, as often happens, the supernumerary finger is attached merely by a soft pedicle it is easily removed, but if it possesses a distinct articulation its amputation may demand the sacrifice of some small part of the metacarpus. * Brit.

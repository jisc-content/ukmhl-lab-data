CHAPTER XXIV. HERNIA. It is well to regard a hernia as the result of some abnormal condition rather than as a pathological entity. Information should be obtained as to the circumstances in which the “ rupture ” first appeared, and what is now most calculated to bring it down. In one case the hernia first came, perhaps, with a fit of vomiting, and now after every meal the child is sick and the tumour appears. Thus the treatment must he directed to the feeding of the child. If he be at the breast, is he allowed to overload the stomach ? Is he rickety ? How often is he fed ? If the reply be, “ I give him the breast when- ever he cries, and I let him have as much as he will take,” the mother is to feed him at regular intervals, and for a limited number of minutes by the dock. Each case must be treated on its merits; and the moi'9 precise the directions the more likely they are to be attended to. If the child be brought up by hand, attention must be given to the nature of the food, the bottle used (page 11), and the way of feeding. Errors of diet, especially in infancy, cause crying and vomiting; they should be specially sought out and corrected. Violent ex- pulsive efforts must be always checked before the child can be cured. If the hernia come down Avith coughing, medical aid Avill be required. A long uvula may be the cause of either coughing or vomiting. With some children the hernia appears during micturition: are the preputial and urethral orifices free ? is a long or adherent prepuce causing irritation and making the child strain ? is there a vesical calculus ? (page 298). Diarrhoea, chronic constipation, the abdominal dis- tension of rickets, and also rectal polypus (page 318), may cause a hernial protrusion, or retard its permanent disappear- ance. A child should not need to strain at defalcation, nor should he be allowed to sit long upon the vessel. If the child

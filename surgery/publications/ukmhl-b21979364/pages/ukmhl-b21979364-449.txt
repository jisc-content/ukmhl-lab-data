The tliigdi being advanced from the vertical line, as already explained, he supports all his weight upon the sound side, the other knee being flexed, and the toe just touching the ground. When standing, he supports himself by a chair or table. When the deformity is great, he may not care to walk or stand. A casual observer might take the limb to be lengthened or shortened, according as the affected side of the pelvis is raised or allowed to drop, as will be explained further on. But, as a matter of fact, there is no alteration whatever in the length of the limb in the early stages of the disease, and lengthening there never can be. Months later, however, there may be marked shortening, which may be due to arrest of development of the femur, etc. (page 424). The walk is characteristic; for the thigh being per- manently advanced, and incompetent to transmit weight, the child limps uneasily, just touching the ground with the toe of the affected side, and paddling himself along. This method of progression soon tires him, and he gladly leaves his play and lies down. For examination of the joint the child should be entirely stripped and placed supine upon a firm couch, or upon the Fig. 100.â€”Limb brought down flat, but loin arched ; lordosis. table or hearth-rug, the range of movement in the sound limb first being tested. The diseased joint being stiff, and partially flexed, it necessarily follows that Avhen both thighs are brought flat down a compensating excurvation (lordosis) (Fig. 100) occurs at the loins beneath which the hand can be easily passed; this is effaced by raising the knee (Fig. 101). The explanation is that the thigh being advanced and rigidly fixed at the acetabulum, a serviceable joint has developed in the lumbar region, the rigid system of femur and pelvis becoming capable of greatly increased flexion and extension on the spine. When the loins are flat and the pelvis is

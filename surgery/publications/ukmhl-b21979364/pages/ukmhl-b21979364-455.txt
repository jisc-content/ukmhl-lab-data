415 TREATMENT. long enough to form an ample loop below the foot, and to reach up on each side of the leg to the lower third of the thigh. The strip is narrowest in the middle, and there, upon the adhesive side, is laid a slip of deal, three inches long by two wide, with a hole bored through the middle. Extending for a few inches beyond the ends of this piece of Avood is placed another strip of strapping, Avith the adhesive surface towards that of the other slip, the Avood being betAveen them. This second strip is to prevent the loop of the longer one sticking to the malleoli when the stirrup is fixed, and also for securing the Avood, which is for the purpose of keeping the strapping from the sides of the foot and ankle. When adjusted, Fig. 106.â€”Stirrup applied ; strapping should be shown extending above knee. it should be secured by a soft roller, the weight being applied when the strapping has obtained a firm hold. Then the cord is passed through the strapping and Avood, a knot is made at the upper end of the cord, and a Aveight or shot-bag is hung at the other, the cord being passed over a pulley. The pulley may be made of a cotton-reel, Avhich has running through its axis a knitting-needle, Avhich is to be fixed to tAVO of the upright bars of the cot. The traction must always be in the axis of the femur; if it be arranged only in the axis of the body, the apparent improvement in position is obtained by a still further tilting of the pelvis, or arching of the loins. From time to time, as the thigh can be brought flatter Avithout arching the loins, the pulley must also be loAvered. In order to keep the child flat and straight in bed, a padded Avooden splint may be fixed along the sound side from axilla to ankle. When there is so much flexion of the thigh that the pulley has to be considerably raised in order to keep the

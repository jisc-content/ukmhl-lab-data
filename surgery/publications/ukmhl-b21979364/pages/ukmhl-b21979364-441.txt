CONGENITAL DISLOCATION OF FEMUR. 401 Luxation of the 'proximal phalanx of the thumb may require excision of the head of the metacarpal bone. Congenital dislocation of the femur may exist on one side or both sides, and is more often found in girls than in boys. The signs are by no means marked in infancy; the proba- bility is that the lesion will pass unrecognised until the child begins to stand, when, from the centre of gravity being in advance of the normal line of support, the equilibrium is unstable. If luxation be symmetrical, the child develops incurvation in the loins (lordosis), in order that the centre of gravity may be brought to the proper situation by bringing the shoulders backwards. Thus the abdomen is extremely prominent, and the buttocks are large (Fig. 98). When the child is in the horizontal position, the chief charac- teristics of the luxation are effaced. On account of the shortness and the small girth of the lower limbs, the upper part of the body may appear disproportionately large. Where the affection is unilateral, there may be difficulty in forming a positive diagnosis. The child walks with a waddling gait, the thigh of that side is small and flabby, and its range of abduction is greatly limited. The top of the great trochanter is above the line which is drawn round the buttock from the anterior superior spine of the ilium to the tuberosity of the ischium, and the head of the bone may be felt rotating beneath the gluteal muscles. Pathological anatomy. — Many of the subjects of this lesion have entered the world breech first, and the displace- ment is in consequence sometimes attributed to the thigh having been hooked down by the accoucheur; But this theory is not proved; there has been, moreover, no tenderness detected at the hip joint after birth, such as would surely follow trau- matic dislocation. I have seen cases of congenital displacement A A Fig. 98.—Congenital Dislocation of Fe- rn ora. (After Brodhurst.)

DESCENT OF TESTIS. 337 be any doubt as to the nature of a small, firm, and oval swelling in the neighbourhood ot the pubes, peri'nseum, oi oi Poupart’s ligament, the scrotum should be. examined with reference to the presence of both testes. L his simple matter is often forgotten. If one gland be absent, the finger should be made to sweep with firm pressure down the course of the inguinal canal; this may suffice to reveal the lingering testis. If the testis, coaxed down from the ring, ascend again, the pad of a truss may obstruct its return. Fig. 75 shows the testicle behind the peritoneum passing into the inguinal canal. Fig. 76 shows it in the scrotum behind the cul-de- sac, which is to per- sist as the tunica vaginalis. In Fig. 76 the tunica vaginalis has separated from the funicular pro- cess. Obliteration of the tubular prolong- ation should take place soon after the testis has passed into the scrotum; a slender fibrous cord then connects the peritoneal sac with the tunica vaginalis. If the serous fluid moistening the peritoneal cavity gravi- tate into the tunica vaginalis, a congenital hydrocele (Fig. 77) results. The fluid can be emptied into the abdominal cavity by placing the patient on his back and raising the scrotum ; hut on lowering the pelvic region the fluid trickles down again. If the spermatic cord be then loosely pinched at the external abdominal ring, and the scrotum squeezed by the other hand, the fluid may easily be felt gurgling up the narrowed passage. If, when all the fluid has been returned, pressure at the ring be remitted, the fluid slowty descends. This examination shows that scrotal fulness is due to serum, not to intestine. In the latter case the descent would have been sudden and bulky. The smaller the aperture, the slower the descent; and if the passage be very minute w Fig. 75.-—Testis descending be- Fig. 76.—Tunica hind Peritoneum from Renal Vaginalis con- Region. nected with Peritoneal Sac b y Fibrous Thread.

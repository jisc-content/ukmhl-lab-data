SOARS AFTER HEALING. 161 ensure the greatest amount of suppleness for the scar; but care must be taken lest the frail scar-tissue give way. The healing of healthy ulcers may be accelerated by skin grafting; for this purpose minute chips of healthy skin which has just been removed at a circumcision may be made available (Lucas). For Thiersch’s method of grafting, the granulating wound is made aseptic and healthy; the superficial granulations are scraped away, and bleeding is arrested by firm pressure applied over a layer of “ protective.” The front of the thigh having been made aseptic, broad strips are shaved from it through about half the thickness of the skin. These strips are then spread close to each other over the surface of the sore, and, covered with protective, are firmly surrounded with sterilised dressings. They should not be examined for about a week. Keloid growths are apt to form in the cicatrix after a burn. (See page 146.) L

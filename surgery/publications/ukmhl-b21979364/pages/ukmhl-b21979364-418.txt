378 CHAPTER XXVII. FRACTURES. In tlie rickety child the bones, though containing an exces- sive proportion of animal matter, are brittle. This may be due to the fact that the conversion into the solid bone is accomplished by a process of calcification rather than of ossification. From the continuous crying or fretfulness, the mother suspects that there is something wrong, and when the part is disturbed during washing or dressing there are mani- festations of pain. Sometimes the nature of the injury is not recognised for a day or two. Often, no history of the child having met with injury is to be obtained. The first step in the examination of an injured child is to have it completely stripped of clothing, without un- necessary exposure to cold, and laid on a firm, flat surface, such as a table on which a blanket has been folded. Inspec- tion is made for bruises or swellings. Then the limbs are examined, any apparently tender part especially receiving- attention. Each joint is cautiously exercised, and the in- tegrity of the epiphyseal cartilages tested. The child should be turned over and the spinal column examined. The ribs are rarely broken, on account of their great elasticity. The child should be kept in his cot for a day or two, for the appearance of some local swelling and tenderness may prove that, after all, a joint has been sprained or a periosteum bruised. The diagnosis of fracture may rest upon circumstantial evidence; thus, the child Avas Avell in the morning, later he is found crying, and unable to move the SAVollen limb. The suddenness of the occurrence, the existence of circum- ferential and deeply-seated swelling, and the evidence of tenderness, suffice. The swelling is due to effusion of blood around the fractured part; but if the periosteum and

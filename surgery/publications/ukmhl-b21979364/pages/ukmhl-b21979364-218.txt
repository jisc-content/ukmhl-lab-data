MALFORMATIONS OF EXTERNAL FAR. 178 Fig. 34.—1 to 4, Clefts and arches; av, Auditory Vesicle; N, Nasal Pit; E, Optic Vesicle; OF, Orbital Fissure. 1 ®*”V. If the pinna be prominent and unsightly, it may be flat- tened against the side of the head by a fold of soft wool and a bandage or strapping. But if this do not suffice, an elliptical piece of skin may be dissected off the back of the concha, close against the scalp, the edges of the wound being then approxi- mated by fine sutures. In exceptional cases it may be necessary to excise also a piece of cartilage for the cure of this deformity; but it is thus easily and completely remedied. Supernumerary auricles and pendu- lous growths are occasionally seen in the neighbourhood of the ear (Fig. 35). They should be removed during infancy. Occasionally they are found along the front of the neck; they'' are due to redundancy of tissue left after the closure of the visceral clefts. (See Lancet, February 18th, 1888.) Development.—The lower part of the face and the upper part of the neck are originally mapped out in live processes, the visceral arches (Fig. 34). From the uppermost of these the lower jaw is built up. Clefts are placed between the arches ; they extend through into the pharynx (Fig. 36). From the highest of them the Eustachian tube and the tym- panum are developed; the lower clefts (which represent the branchial apertures of aquatic animals) eventually undergo obliteration. But small congenital apertures may be met with, extending towards the pharynx or oesophagus, from one or both sides. Often they are just above the sterno-clavicular articulation or along the front of the sterno-mastoid. They are called bran- chial fistula. Clear mucus may exude from them. They are, Fig. 35.—Auricular Appendage, the Re- sult of Irregular Closure of a Branchial Fissure. (See also Fig. 40.)

BOWING OF THE STERNUM 87 gentle movements, help to correct the anterior bulging of the chest, the child being also encouraged to take slow and deep inspirations. Exercises with light dumb-bells and “ chest- expanders ” are desirable, as are also gymnastics generally, provided always that the strength and capabilities of the feeble child be not over-taxed thereby. Bowing of the sternum may occur when air is greatly hindered in entering a soft-walled thorax. It is due to the lower end of the pliant breastbone being pulled backwards by the energetic but vain contractions of the diaphragm. In some rickety children the sternum is deeply indented, under the combined influence of muscular contraction and atmospheric pressure. Treatment should be directed towards securing a free entrance of air, and improving the general condition of the child (page 70).

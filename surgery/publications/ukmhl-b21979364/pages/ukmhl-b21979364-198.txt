CHAPTER XI. BURNS AND SCALDS. Burns and scalds are very serious injuries in childhood. They may cause death by shock, exhaustion, tetanus, lung disease, or blood-poisoning. Children are sometimes badly scalded by being incautiously plunged into a hot bath when in convulsions ; by the application pf over-hot poultices, or even by the upsetting of a tea-cup. Serious injury and shock may result from a child being made to sit over a chamber-vessel containing hot water, for the relief of chronic constipation. From this cause I have known extensive ulceration to occur on each buttock. Prognosis is most unfavourable when the burn is about the pelvis, abdomen, or thorax; this may be on account of the close proximity of the sympathetic plexuses. When as much as one-third of the surface of the body is burnt, re- covery is highly improbable. Prognosis thus depends upon the extent of skin injured as well as on the area affected. Even though there be apparently but slight shock, soon after the occurrence of the burn, prognosis must be guarded. (For burn of glottis see page 239.) Treatment.—If a child’s clothes were ablaze, and he have been wrapped in a table-cloth, coat, or rug, he had better not be disturbed until chloroform has been administered. The clothes should be cautiously removed, and each burned and scalded part dressed. After this, the less the child is dis- turbed the better. To diminish the effects of shock, hot bottles wrapped in flannel may be placed in the bed, and warm drinks given. No one should be allowed at the bed- side b\it the nurse on duty, for quiet is of vital importance. Wine should he given at short intervals, with milk or egg, and when reaction is established morphia should be adminis- tered in small, repeated doses. Bromide of potassium may be indicated if convulsions supervene, but even then confidence may be placed rather in the morphia; castor oil may be

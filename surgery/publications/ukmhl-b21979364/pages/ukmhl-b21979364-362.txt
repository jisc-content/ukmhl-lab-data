322 INTUSSUSCEPTION. abdominal wall remaining actually flat throughout. There may be no peritonitis, and only local tenderness. Moreover, it cannot be too clearly stated that the abdominal cavity may, and usually does, remain undistended, and its wall flaccid. There is, of course, some enteritis, but peritonitis is a late complication. As a rule, the ileo-ctecal valve itself forms the apex of the protrusion. The prolapsing ileum and caecum (ileo-eaecal variety), playing the part of a foreign body, is grasped by the ensheath- ing bowel (Fig. 74) and thrust on as a mass of faeces would be. Sometimes the intussuscepted bowel is carried along the trans- verse arch of the colon, or even down to the rectum, or through the anus. In this condition an oblong tumour may be made out by digital examination through the abdominal walls. Such tu- mour may be firm and sausage- shaped ; it is movable, and not very tender, and it may be found in almost any region of the ab- dominal cavity, the colon, in childhood, being very loosely at- tached. The intussusception may be due to an exaggerated peri- stalsis set up by diarrhoea, an intestinal polypus or diverticulum, or by some other form of irritation. Sometimes the invagination seems to be the direct result of a blow upon the abdomen or of a fall. More than one invagination may exist in the same child. Usually the patient is under two years of age, and very often under six months. The higher in the canal that the strangulation occurs, the sooner does collapse supervene. In most cases vomiting comes on at the moment of the strangu- lation taking place, or very quickly after its occurrence. The constant vomiting, the disinclination to swallow fluids, and the sympathetic irritation combine to diminish the amount of urine passed. Fig. 74.â€”Intussusception.

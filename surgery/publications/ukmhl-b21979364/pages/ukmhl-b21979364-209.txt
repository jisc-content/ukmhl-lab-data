OEREJBRAL PARALYSIS. 169 examining tlie child, the limbs may become rigidly Hexed, or drawn together with spasmodic violence. Often there is inter- trigo near the genitals. If the child attempts to walk, the limbs stiffen and the heels are drawn up (because the muscles, free from control, overact their part), the toes being- made to scrape along the floor. There is no wasting of the muscles at first, unless the anterior cornua of the grey matter be also impli- cated ; but in due course the muscles become stiff and contracted, the feet are deformed, as shown in Fig. 29, the fingers" clawed,” and the child is a hopeless cripple. Surgery cannot do much for these cases; massage gives little result, and tenotomy is usually disappointing. Neverthe- less, a careful search should be made for peri- pheral irritation, especially about the genitals. A long- prepuce should at once be removed, and all adhesions thoroughly broken down. The disease is often associated with fits, or with imbecility. In the early stages of the disease division of the Achilles tendons may prove helpful for a while. Cerebral paralysis.—I have at present under my care a child of about eight years, who is mentally and physically imbecile, or, as its parents euphemistically term it, “ back- ward.” Its lower extremities, and the muscles of one side of the body, are feeble and rigid, and on that side there is talipes equinus; the reflexes are exaggerated. On that side also there is adductor spasm. The association of the mental Fig. 29.—Spastic Paralysis. The child could not sit or stand.

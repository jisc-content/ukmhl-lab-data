411 DIFFERENTIA L DIA GNOSIS. (Fig. 102 shows the method of squaring the pelvis.) When inflammation has left the joint fixed and the thigh adducted, an attempt to bring the leg down straight will cause that side of the pelvis to be raised and the limb to appear shortened. Fig. 103. On the other hand, when a stiff and abducted thigh is brought straight the limb appears lengthened. Actual shortening of the limb may be due to inhibition at the areas of growth of the bones, to early union of the epiphysis, or to disinte- gration, the result of rarefying ostitis or necrosis, as explained by reference to page 424. Differential diagnosis.—Stiffness at the hip joint may be due to abscess in the sheath of the psoas or iliacus, and to various other conditions which may be differentiated by flexing the thigh of the damaged side and then gently rotating it. A child may bravely endure the slight pain and dread of the examination, and then burst out crying, so for a while his face must be watched for the slightest expression of pain; if he be hurt or frightened, the value of the examination is diminished. To obtain the confi- dence of the little patient, the examination should always be gone through first with the sound limb. Unlike adults, children cannot give definite information as regards pain, but their complaints demand careful considera- tion. The oft-repeated cry of “ My leg does ache ! ” must not be disregarded. If the child allow the head of the femur to be gently rotated in the acetabulum without complaint or expression of pain, there is no disease of the articulation; cause for the stiffness must be sought elsewhere.

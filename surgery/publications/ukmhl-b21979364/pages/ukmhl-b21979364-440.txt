400 CHAPTER XXVIII. DISLOCATIONS. Dislocations from injury are extremely rare; violence near a joint is more likely to detach an epiphysis. Of traumatic dislocations, one that is not unlikely to occur is that of the bones of the forearm backwards, the coronoid process of the ulna being detached. The dislocation having been reduced in the ordinary way, the elbow had better be enclosed for a fortnight or three weeks in a moulded splint. (For differen- tial diagnosis from separation of epiphysis, see page 388.) A dislocation of the radius peculiar to early childhood is that in which the head of the bone slips through the orbi- cular ligament; it is apt to occur when a child is lifted, swung, or dragged by the hand. No characteristic deformity is presented, but the elbow is swollen, tender, and slightly flexed, and its movement is interfered with. The nature of the lesion is veiy apt to be overlooked. The reduction is best effected by flexing the elboAv to a right angle, or beyond it (so as to bring the radial head up to the capitellum), and gently but fully pronating the forearm, so as to screw, as it were, the head of the radius back through the orbicular ligament. The elbow had better be fixed at a right angle for a week or so. Sometimes, however, even under chloroform, the surgeon fails in his attempt to reduce the dislocation. He must then be content to leave the head upon the anterior plane, and trust to its acquiring a useful articulation outside the joint. And in this he is not likely to be disappointed. The question of resection should not be considered until considerable time has elapsed. I have recently had under treatment two children with dislocation of the radius forwards from injury. One case had been an uncomplicated luxation, the other had been associated with fracture of the humerus into the joint. The former was of some monthsâ€™ standing and did not prove amenable to treatment.

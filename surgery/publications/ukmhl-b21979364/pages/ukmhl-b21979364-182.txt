NJEVI. 142 inconspicuous. Sometimes when the mass is being dissected out, it is seen to be incorporated with a large amount of pinkish, nodular fat. This tumour—for which nothing short of excision would serve—constitutes a• ncevo-lipoma. It often grows very rapidly. Excision is specially suited for the deep nsevus in which All skin, however, which is affected must be removed. There is, as a rule, no sloughing or suppuration (such as must occur with the thermo-cautery), and the obliteration is tho- roughly effected at the one operation — which could not be done by electrolysis. The subcutaneous liga- ture I have long aban- doned ; it is a - painful procedure. The effect is produced with sloughing and suppuration. Parts of the strangled mass escape obliteration and have to be attacked afresh, and much constitutional depression attends the discharge. Strangling by ligatures around hare-lip pins is also to be condemned. Excision is far better. Injection of perchloride of iron or other irritant is dan- gerous. I have seen a case in which the ala of the nose sloughed after a subcutaneous injection of tannin, and a fatal result has followed the entrance of injected fluid, or of a loose coagulum, into the general circulation. Vaccination as a means of removing nsevi is more speculative than practical. Hideous scars may be caused by it, and yet the nsevus may have escaped obliteration. I have met with two instances in which a large cavernous nsevus involved the mamma. In both cases there was no alternative but to remove the mamma. Appreciation of the various methods.—When a large nsevus is brought for treatment, no thought should be given to sodic ethylate, vaccination, or ligature, reliance being placed the skin is but slightly affected.

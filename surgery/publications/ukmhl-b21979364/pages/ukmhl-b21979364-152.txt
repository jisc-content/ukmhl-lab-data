116 ENLARGEMENT OF LYMPHATIC GLANDS. \ tumour unmistakably demonstrated its sarcomatous nature. After the operation, the child’s pulse for three days ran at 180, but the temperature only once reached 100°; the wound healed completely, and the infant was taken home in a good state of health a month later. In cases like this no treat- ment short of extensive operation can possibly avail, and though the shock attending it may end fatally, still, as the inevitable alternative to operation is death, the most serious risk should be unhesitatingly accepted and the operation undertaken. Permanently satisfactory results after operation in these cases are quite exceptional; still, operation offers the only chance of relief. The disease is recognised for certainty only by the microscope. For the obliteration of depressed cicatrices Adams re- commended the subcutaneous division of adhesions by a tenotomy knife, introduced beyond the margin of the cicatrix and carried down to its base. The cicatrix is then elevated, and kept in position by fine hare-lip pins. On the second day the pins are removed, and the scar tissue is allowed to find its level. It will probably remain for a while somewhat raised. But I agree with Ashby and Wright that a far better result may generally be obtained by dissecting out the puckered scar and replacing it by a linear cicatrix.

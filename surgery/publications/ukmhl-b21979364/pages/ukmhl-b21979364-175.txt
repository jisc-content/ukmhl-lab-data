135 FATTY TUMOURS. be likely to suffer from profound collapse, and probably the operation would have to be given up long before removal was completed. Fatty tumours. — A soft, lobulated, 'movable tumour in the neighbourhood of the thigh, buttock, or shoulder, is probably a lipoma. The differential diagnosis is chiefly from chronic abscess, nsevus, and malignant disease. Any doubt as to the nature of the growth could be cleared up at the time of the ablation, and it is sometimes expedient to withhold till then a positive opinion as to the nature of the tumour. A lobulated swelling in the middle line of the back must be regarded with suspicion. (Spina bifida, page 241.) Fibromata may occur in the skin, or in the connective tissue of any region. They are of a benign nature. Strange fibrous nodules from the size of a shot- corn to a bean, and even larger, are sometimes found just be- neath the skin in children with acute rheumatism. They often lie over the bony prominences of the knee, elbow, shoulder, occiput, and ankle. They can be slipped about beneath the skin without causing discomfort, and in due course they may quietly disappear. Chondromata occur upon the metacarpal bones, the phalanges, and at the joint-ends of the longer bones, especially the femur, tibia, and humerus. In these situations chondroma is an innocent growth. It probably springs from an unconverted island of cartilage in the midst of bone-tissue, or from an epiphyseal cartilage. Treatment need not be precipitate, as the tumour may undergo calcification and cease to grow. If in the way, it may be scraped out, or a phalanx removed. Amputation should not be resorted Fig. 25.—A, Exostosis of Humerus being carried away from End of Diaphysis by b, Additions of New Bone. c, Incrustation of Tem porary Cartilage. (See p. 136.)

486 NECROSIS OF THE OS GALOIS. had “ rheumatic fever ” in the previous December. After this so-called rheumatic fever-—which was in all probability a severe attack of pyaemia ostitis—an abscess formed over the lower end of the left ulna ; for fourteen weeks the child had been in a country hospital. The right leg was swollen, and there were sinuses leading down to the necrosed tibia, which was surrounded by an involucrum. Another sinus existed over the right os calcis, through which a probe could be passed to bare hone. The lower third of the left tibia and the left ulna were also necrosed. ‘After the removal of the sequestra from the long hones, the opening into the os calcis was enlarged and a sequestrum the size of a pea was ex- tracted from the interior. The boy’s general condition greatly improved, all the wounds filling up with healthy tissue; but JV. 119.—Diagrammatic enlargement to show central necrosis of os calcis. D, ° Diaphysis of os calcis; E, Epiphysis ; G, Wall of granulation-tissue lining cavity ; S, Sequesti am. at the date of the last note (December 3rd, 1896) he was still in hospital. Throughout childhood the os calcis consists of a diaphysis of spongy bone, with a cartilaginous epiphysis at the posterior surface. At the tenth year the epiphysis begins to ossify, and it becomes fused with the rest of the bone just after puberty. If the boy happen to have the heel struck, or otherwise hurt, the "vitality of the delicate tissue at the growing end of the diaphysis is lowered. And if there are staphylococci circulating in the blood they may cause a localised thrombosis and necrosis. The heel then becomes

74 CHAPTER V. RACHITIC DEFORMITIES. Genu valgum, or knock-knee, is common amongst rickety children, and, unless attended to, it is apt to persist in a marked form in adult life ; but considering the number of valgous children that we see, and being fully aware of the imperfect way in which our instructions are usually carried out, it is surprising that the number of knock-kneed adults is not larger. The deduction is that some children grow out of their de- formity; but to leave the disfigurement unattended to, and to promise that the child will grow out of it, is to court dis- appointment (Fig. 5). Genu valgum is usually associated with, if not determined by, a relaxation of the muscles and ligaments of the foot, especially along the inner aspect of the arch; the knock-kneed child is generally flat-footed. The anatomy of knock-knee is more fully treated of else- where.* The tibia having lost much of Fig. 5. â€” Extreme Genu its support at the mnei side of the yp]wtograph \From a ankle, the upper surface of its head re- ceives the weight unevenly from the femoral condyles, the outer tuberosity getting more than its due share. This extra pressure causes some arrest of growth at the outer condyle of the femur, whilst, under the diminished pressure, the end of the diaphysis above the inner condyle grows abnormally. This irregular growth of the diaphysis is associated Avith- a convex inward curve of that part of the femur Avhich still further lowers the internal condyle. In some instances it is at the internal tuberosity of the tibia * Journal of Anatomy and Physiology, 1879.

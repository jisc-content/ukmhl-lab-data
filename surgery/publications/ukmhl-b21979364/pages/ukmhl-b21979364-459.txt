TREATMENT. 419 will surely entail permanent stiffness. This superstition is as groundless as it is widely spread. Any splint designed to allow some movement at the joint during the treatment is wrong in principle and unsatisfactory in practice. Dr. Ridlon, of Chicago, confesses that “ the old Fig. 109.—Disease of Eight Hip Joint, splint applied ; patten beneath foot of sound side. American method of motion without friction has passed away,” and that American surgeons now “ believe in fixation first, last, and all the time.” The surgeon must be cautious in pronouncing recovery from hip-joint disease as complete. There is always a great risk of the rest-treatment being discontinued too soon; as convalescence advances the parents are apt to importune for release from the splint. One very cheering sign is when, on the surgeon attempting to move the thigh, the adductor longus and the other muscles cease to throw themselves into apprehensive contraction. This is an indication either that the disease is at an end or that a serviceable ankylosis is taking place.

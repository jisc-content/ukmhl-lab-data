CHAPTER XXIII. HYDROCELE, AND DISEASES OF THE TESTIS. At an early period of development there is nothing in the structure of the internal organs of generation to indicate to which sex the foetus will belong. The testis or ovary is placed in the renal region to the front of the Wolffian body. The testis reaches the internal abdominal ring at about the seventh month. During the eighth month it is in the inguinal canal, and at birth it has generally reached the depths of the scrotum. The descent through the external abdominal ring may be delayed for some days or months after birth; or, appearing now and then outside the ring, the gland may as constantly be retracted. A testis which lingers in the canal, or at the ring, may be encouraged by well-directed and frequent manipulations to complete its descent. But when it long delays its descent, it is apt at last to appear in close company with a piece of bowel; probably the adhesion is the result of limited peritonitis. If there be a congenital hernia, and the testis of that side have not made its appearance, the per- manent wearing of a truss is inadvisable, lest the late descent of the gland be prevented ; for at or just after puberty the healthy testis may make its complete descent. The earlier descent of the left testis explains the more frequent occur- rence of congenital hernia and hydrocele upon the right side (page 338). It is not certain that a testis which has failed to complete its course will be valueless; nevertheless, it is generally imperfectly developed. Misplaced testis.â€”Though the testis have left the abdo- minal ring, instead of passing into the scrotum, it may wander into the groin or perhueum, but it is unable to stray beyond the limits of the deep layer of the superficial fascia. A testicle in the perinamm would eventually preclude its possessor from horse-exercise, and, if injured, might demand ablation. The general health of the child and the condition of

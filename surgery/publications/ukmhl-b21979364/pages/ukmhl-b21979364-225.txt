CONGENITA L AS TMME TB Y. 185 Stiff neck may persist after convalescence from mumps. These cases are best treated by massage and education, as suggested on page 183, and by iron tonics. I have met with wry neck in a boy in whom the deviation was the result merely of habit. Under judicious supervision he was soon cured. Wry neck is said to be sometimes caused by the irritation of intestinal worms or teething; I never met with such a case, however. Sometimes the deformity is due to inequality in the two eyes. In hysterical torticollis complaints of pain and suffering will probably be described in exaggerated terms, certain symptoms being but imperfectly imitated. The patient would most likely experience great distress on the skin of the neck being gently pinched! (See also page 171.) Congenital asymmetry may affect the head and face, as it may the trunk or limbs. The disparity of the two sides is likely to be diminished in the subsequent growth of the child. The disfigurement is not capable of improvement by surgical interference.

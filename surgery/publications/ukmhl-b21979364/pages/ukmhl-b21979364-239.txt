199 CYSTS IN' THE TONGUE. Ulceration of the tongue may be found near the freenum, from the tongue coming in frequent and violent contact with the sharp edge of the lower central incisor teeth, during an attack of whooping cough. It is more apt to occur in little children, in whom the edge of these teeth is still serrated. The treat- ment should he directed chiefly to the relief of the spasmodic cough, jagged teeth being attended to. Cysts in the tongue, if superficial, are easily diagnosed, and, if deeply placed, puncture estab- lishes their identity. Cysts may also occur in the substance of the lip. They may be incised and scraped, or, if need be, dissected out. Dermoid cysts occur- ring between the genio- hyo-glossi are caused by distension of the unob- literated duct of His, which is a passage in the embryo—the thyro-glosscd • duct—descending in the middle line from the pharynx, and traversing the base of the tongue from the foramen csecum to the thyroid isthmus (Fig. 42). Subsequently the developing hyoid bone cuts it into two pieces. The upper piece is called the lingual duct, and from the lower piece—the thyroid duct—the thyroid body is developed. The accumulation of epithelium and sebaceous matter in the unobliterated upper or lower piece of the thyro-glossal duct constitutes a lingual, or a thyroid dermoid. Tumours formed upon the type of thyroid gland tissue are apt to grow from the glossal as well as from the thyroid part of the duct, and they may attain a great size. When at the side, they are probably Fig. 42.—H, Hyoid bone ; L, Lingual part of duct of His; P, Pyramidal lobe; F c, Foramen caecum; s, Thyroid part of duct of His, dilated into a sinus and opening on to median surface of neck ; T B, Thyroid body ; T C, Thyroid cartilage.

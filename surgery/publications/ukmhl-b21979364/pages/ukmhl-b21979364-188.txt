148 CHAPTER X. HYDRO-THORAX AND EMPYEMA. Hydro-thorax.—As a result of inflammation, serous effu- sion may take place into the cavity of the pleura. It is only when the amount of effusion is excessive that surgical interference is called for. Then, the earlier the fluid is drawn oft, the greater the chance of the lung tissue recovering its function. When the pleura is full of fluid, the lung, emptied of air, is compressed against the vertebral column. There is, there- fore, a complete absence of breath sounds over the basal, anterior, and lateral regions of that side of the chest. The percussion note is absolutely dull: and when the hand is laid flat upon the ribs, and the child coughs, cries, or speaks, no vocal vibration can be detected, the sound-waves being cut off’ by the intervening fluid. On listening between the scapulas, air may be heard entering the bronchial tubes. The heart may be considerably displaced, especially if the collec- tion be upon the left side, the apex beating far from its normal situation—which is just below and to the inner side of the nipple. The side of the chest appears abnormally full, and the lower intercostal furrows may possibly—hut not probably—be effaced. That side of the chest does not move with the other, and as the one lung has to do the work of two, the respiration is hurried, especially as the child changes his position in bed. He naturally lies upon the water- logged side. Differential diagnosis.—The signs are not always as clearly marked as above recorded. From consolidation of tlie lung, the diagnosis will be made by the history of the case ; by there being in the case of consolidation some in- creased vocal fremitus and tubular breathing; by the absence of fulness of that side of the chest, and by persistence ol the intercostal furrows. Notice also should be taken of the character of the sputum. From malignant disease the

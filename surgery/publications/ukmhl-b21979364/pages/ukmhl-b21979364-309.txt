2(39 CHAPTER XX. THE GENITO-URINARY TRACT. In the process of development, a hollow growth, like the finger of a glove, starts from the hinder end of the primitive intestine, and, extending upwards and forwards, leaves the abdomen by a wide gap in the anterior Avail. This is the allantois. Its pedicle is subsequently dilated into the bladder, whilst the upper part of the tube, continued through the umbilicus, is the urachus. Then a partition grows down- wards to convert the existing cloaca into tAvo passages, the urethra and the rectum. Thus at birth the fusiform bladder is an abdominal rather than a pelvic viscus (Fig. 66). In rare instances the obliteration of the urachus is delayed, so that urine, and even vesical calculi, pass through the umbilicus of the young child. For the treatment of the fistula, the urethra should be explored by a fine catheter; and, if neces- sary, the Avater should be draAvn off at regular intervals, so as to give the abnormal opening the chance of closing. If cicatrisation be delayed, the aperture may be touched Avith the cautery. But the treatment of the fistula becomes a secondary matter should calculus or phimosis be present. Small vascular polypi may groAv in the depths of the umbilical cicatrix. They take their origin from the trun- cated urachus, Avhich granulates after the attached end of the umbilical cord has fallen, or from the cut end of a Meckel’s diverticulum. At times no larger than a pin’s head, they may attain the size of a currant or plum. They are bright red, bleed at the slightest touch, and are associated Avith so much irritating secretion that the skin around the Fig. 66.—Development of Bladder from hinder End of Alimen- tary Canal; Continuation of Bladder through Umbilicus.

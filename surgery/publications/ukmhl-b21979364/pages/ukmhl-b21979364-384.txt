344- DERMOID CYSTS OF SCROTUM. Operation.â€”The child having been anaesthetised, the scrotum and adjoining parts are again washed with weak carbolic lotion. The integuments are pinched up between the finger and thumb, and transfixed; the cord is laid bare, and, with the testicle, is raised from its bed. An aseptic silk ligature is passed round the entire cord and firmly tied. The spermatic cord is then cut. The ligature should be tied well above the testis and cut short, and if the vas deferens or the lymphatic tissue of the cord be thickened, the higher it is placed the bettei\ The thighs are tied together, and the knees bent over a pillow. Dermoid cysts of the scrotum are of more frequent occurrence than of the testis, being the result of imperfect fusion of the lateral halves of the body. Souietimes, how- ever, they are connected Avith the testis. They may contain bone, hair, or other strange material, and are probably noticed soon after birth. The tumour is hard, painless, and irregular in shape ; the mass is apt to undergo suppurative inflam- mation. The treatment is ablation, and if in the course of the operation the testicle be found but imperfectly connected Avith the mass, it should be saved.

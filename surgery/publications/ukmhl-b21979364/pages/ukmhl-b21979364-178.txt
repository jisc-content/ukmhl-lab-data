138 CHAPTER IX. NiEVI, warts, boils, keloid, etc. NjEVUS is a dilatation of blood-vessels, capillary or venous; it is not necessarily noticed directly after birth. (Arterial naevi have been described, but I, personally, have never met with one in a child.) A naevus may be situated in or beneath the skin, mucous membrane, or muco-cutaneous tissue, and a great number of mevi may exist in different parts of the child. Superficial naevi may be merely flat patches, as in “ port- wine mark,” without any thickening. They may be associated with much pigmentary staining, or with abnormal growth of hair—ncevi pilosi. When but thinly covered, they are apt to cause troublesome or even serious haemorrhage. The arteries supplying a venous naevus are generally small, though sometimes pulsation can be made out in them near the base of the tumour. The veins are dilated, and form blood sinuses such as those found in ordinary erectile tissue. This expansion of the veins produces absorption of the fibrous tissue of the framework of the naevus, so that the tumour may often be squeezed flat and empty. This fact helps in diagnosing them from dermoid and other cysts. When beneath skin or mucous membrane, and not impli- cating the surface, the diagnosis may be uncertain; but sooner or later the superjacent vessels are implicated, and the nature of the growth is revealed. If increase in size be rapid, the resemblance to malignant disease may become very close. A subcutaneous naevus is likely to feel knotted or spongy, the skin over it showing a bluish tint, from the presence of dilated vessels beneath ; but when deeply beneath the skin a naevus may grow to a considerable size before it shows any superficial staining. A naevus may remain quiescent for a long while after birth, and then assume active growth. W hen upon the face or head, it is apt to become turgid when the child cries ; its ceasing to do so is suggestive of consolidation,

Imperforate rectum.—During foetal life the upper part of the rectum, which is developed from the internal blastodermic layer, descends into the pelvis, but is separated by a con- siderable depth of tissue from the surface of the perinseum. There a de- pression is found in the skin, at the site of the Fig. 70.—R, Pelvic portion Fig. 71.—Impel’- hltlUC R11US, which, deep- forate Anus: r, ening into the pelvis, Eectum; A, ° I ’ Anus. forms a shut sac, the upper end of which is fused into the blind end of the bowel to complete the outlet. If absorption of the partition fail to take place, complete intestinal obstruction results, though the anus itself may be well formed. In every case of obstinate constipation careful inspection of the anus, and of the lower part of the rectum, should be undertaken. Case.—An infant three or four years old had passed nothing; the nurse had dosed it with castor oil, and it was desperately sick. On introducing the finger, a septum was detected; this was broken through with a director, and the opening Avas then dilated with dress- ing forceps ; a motion was passed, and the Fig. 72. r, Rectal Cui- child did well. Such cases, however, may tie - sac surrounded oive perpetual trouble from contraction ending in fibrous cord. Ol tllG rGldlctinin^’ £11111 Vlltir COllStllCtlOll (Fig. 70). Another girl, of five years, was under treatment for a constriction an inch and a half within the anus, which was so unyielding that all that could be done was to wash out the fie cal accumulations from time to time by an irrigator.

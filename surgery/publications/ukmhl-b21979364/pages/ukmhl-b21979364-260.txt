CHAPTER XY. HARE-LIP. The median part of the upper lip is formed by a process which descends from the front of the cranium in connection with the fronto-nasal plate ; the lateral parts are developed from the coverings of the maxillary processes, which, ex- tending inwards, are eventually fused with the descending flap at a short distance from the median line (Fig. 45). Thus, the fissure of the imperfectly developed lip is at some distance from the middle line, namely, where the median process should blend with the Fig. 45.—Notch in process, lateral fold. In certain rare instances, t,le S“P is exactly in the middle of deepening of this notch phe ]jp • 'put a median cleft would not gives median hare-lip. t , extend into a nostril—such an error would be developmental^ impossible; but it might reach almost to the septum of the nose, as in Fig. 46. If a unilateral arrest of development takes place, a single hare-lip (Fig. 47) results; if the arrest be sym- metrical, the cleft is double (Fig. 48). The central part of the lip is developed from the bifid fronto-nasal process, and if the interval between the two lateral tubercles fails to be effaced, a median cleft results. Some day a child may be forth- coming who has lateral hare-lip associated with a median cleft. In Mr. Pitts’s case Nature had confined her forgetfulness to the integumental part of the fronto-nasal process, the pra3- Fig. 46.—Median Hare-lip (Mr. Pitts’s case).

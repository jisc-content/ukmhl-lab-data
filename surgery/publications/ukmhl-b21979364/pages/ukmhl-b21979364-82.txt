58 TUBERCULOSIS. The result of this is that a growth of granulation-tissue takes the place of the cancellated tissue, leaving nothing but the compact shell. In due course this also gives way, and the granulation-tissue spreads into the adjacent synovial mem- brane (Fig 3), cartilage, or bone, as the case may be. During all this time the affected bone does not increase in size, for tuberculous inflammation of bone is a rarefying, not an osteo-plastic process. Tuberculous ostitis is not always a primary affection. It often happens, for instance, that a tuberculous syno- vitis determines the Avreckage of the adjacent bone - tissue, granulations spreading as easily from synovial membrane into bone as in the oppo- site direction. Thus, Avhen a knee is opened for intractable synovitis, the granulation-tissue may be seen creep- ing over the articular cartilage “ like ivy on a Avail,” and Avorking its Avay beneath it, and through the compact lamella into the interior of the bone. But, hoAvever much the articular end of the femur, or of any other long 3.—Tuberculous Abscess bone, may be involved, the bone is not D*ap0hysisEnope°nfiiem£ sclerosed.

But Avhen the joint is opened for the purpose of performing a resection, it is at once seen that there is no bony enlargement Avliatever. When tuberculous inflammation attacks the delicate new bone at the end of a diaphysis or of the interior of an epiphysis, it sometimes sets up a localised thrombosis which ends in necrosis. The sequestrum then lying in the midst of the bone causes so much irritation that chronic osteo-plastic inflammation ensues, and the end of the bone becomes

236 CHAPTER XVII. FOREIGN BODY IN WIND-PIPE—SCALD OF FAUCES. By a natural instinct, little children put everything up to or into the mouth. In the latter case a small body, such as a bead, button, coin, or seed, may be carried with the inspired air, and “ go the wrong way.” Or, from careless feeding, small bones or fruit-stones may enter the larynx. The substance may be lodged in the larynx, or it may pass into the trachea or one of the bronchi, more likely the right, as it is the larger. If it be lodged in the larynx, spasmodic coughing is at once set up, and this may have the effect of causing its expulsion. If the body remain, the coughing and dyspnoea continue, and, inflammation attacking the mucous membrane, respiration becomes insufficient. There may be evident tenderness at the thyroid region. The dyspnoea is paroxysmal, and the child clutches at his throat or stuffs his fingers into his mouth. The voice is altered, and the face becomes red and dusky: the veins swell up, perspiration is profuse, and exhaustion advances. The laryngoscope seldom affords practical information (but in certain- cases the Rontgen rays might give valuable help). The child resists the introduction of the mirror, and if, with the help of chloroform, an inspection be made, nothing, probably, is seen but swollen tissues and frothy mucus. The history of the case and the suddenness of the attack suffice for the diagnosis; and possibly the child shows by signs what has happened, or states clearly that he has swallowed something with which he was playing just before the attack came on. Treatment.—A thorough digital exploration of the upper opening of the larynx is made; and, this failing, the ad- ministration of an emetic (sulphate of zinc) may procure the liberation and ejection of the body. If this also fail, the child must be inverted and roughly shaken, and slapped between the shoulders whilst he is held in the inverted position. Iu

The catheter is not withdrawn; a ligature is placed around the root of the penis. A thin indiarubber bag may be passed into the rectum; when gently distended with warm water, it raises the bladder into the hypogastric region and elevates its superior peritoneal fold, though this is rarely necessary. A three-inch incision is made in the middle line, ending upon the front of the symphysis. By the careful use of the dissecting forceps and director, the front of the bladder is reached; it is then seized with mouse-toothed forceps, and opened in the

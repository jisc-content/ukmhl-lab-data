451 AMPUTATION. In many of those poor children the limbs are covered with long silken hairs; these had better be shaved off, as they adhere to the dressings. This hairiness is generally associated with constitutional weakness. The limb should be raised to empty it of blood, and its circulation controlled by the fingers of a colleague, or by a flat elastic band; but there must be no severe constriction of the wasted limb. The first flap is cut in the front of the thigh by a large scalpel, but not by transfixion, and it should be long enough to fall over the sawn bone. The skin at the lower end of the flaps should be healthy, but the presence of an old sinus or ulceration matters little, provided it be efficiently scraped. Soon after the operation the child should be placed in the sunshine or open air. When the stump has become perfectly sound, and free from pain, the child may, if old and strong- enough, be trusted on crutches, but there should be no hurry about his being supplied with an artificial leg or even a pin. Though amputation for knee-joint disease should be resorted to only in extreme cases, it is a highly satisfactory measure as regards the rapidity of convalescence. A child in the last stage of exhaustion from knee-joint disease may, a few days after amputation, be sitting up in bed, playing with toys and enjoying his meals.

SACRO-COGGYGEAL TUMOURS. I-5 A sacrococcygeal tumour grows most easily in a down- ward direction, and it may quickly form a soft mass pendulous from the pelvic outlet. Sometimes the growth becomes pedunculated in appearance. Fig. 19 is drawn from a preparation in the Hunterian Museum ; the tumour in this case apparently started from Luschka’s gland. The infant was six weeks old. Treatment.—Inasmuch as the tumour is certain to keep on growing, to block the rectum, and ultimately to destroy the infant’s life, a determined attempt should be made to remove it by dissection. If, however, the intra-pelvic attachments be very extensive, removal may be impossible, in which case the surgeon must temporise, performing an inguinal colotomy as soon as the rectum is blocked.

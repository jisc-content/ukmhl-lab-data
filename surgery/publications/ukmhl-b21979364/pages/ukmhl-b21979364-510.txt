Though the integuments may be discoloured, thickened with oedema and riddled with sinuses, Syme’s amputation need not be precluded ; even in unpromising cases it should he preferred to amputation in the lower third of the leg. Conical stumps.—Unless the fact be recognised that a conical stump is apt to follow certain amputations in child- hood, parents may be dissatisfied and the surgeon disappointed when a sawn humerus or tibia is found pressing against a tender and threadbare scar. Still, this occurrence is almost as physiological as that of the growing schoolboy’s sleeves and trousers “ getting too short.” When amputation is done in the diaphysis, the humerus or the tibia still keeps on growing from its upper epiphysis, regardless of the fact that the skin and subjacent tissues have no provision for keeping pace with it. The important epiphysis in the growth of the humerus and of the tibia is the upper one. In the case of the bones of the thigh and forearm, however, the lower epiphyses are the more important, and it is, therefore, quite exceptional if the stump of a child’s thigh or forearm becomes conical. (See Lancet, Oct. 3, 1891.) The inconvenience may be dealt with by removing the end of the protruding bone from time to time, as circumstances may direct, or it may be prevented by destroying the growing end of the diaphysis at the time of the amputation. But this might have the effect of leaving too short a piece of bone in the stump. I greatly prefer the former and less radical line of treatment.

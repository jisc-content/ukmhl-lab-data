SYPHILIS. 102 a series of cases of syphilis which had been traced to infection from a congenitally syphilitic baby. (The mother of this child presented an old syphilitic ulcer of the leg.) The baby had ulcers at the mouth and anus. From this baby its brother had been infected, the primary sore being on the cheek; also a girl, aged three, the primary sore being on the mouth. This was probably due to sucking the baby’s “dummy titty.” The girl had secondary symptoms, and had infected her own mother, the primary sore being on the left nipple.

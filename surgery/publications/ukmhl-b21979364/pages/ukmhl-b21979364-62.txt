38 CHAPTER III. TRACHEOTOMY ; THYROTOMY. Tracheotomy Is likely to be one of the first operations the young practitioner is called upon to perform. It is often demanded after daylight, and when skilled assistance is out of reach.

Statistics are of no avail in the appreciation of this operation; each case is to be considered on its merits. If a child is suffering from dyspnoea, or is being exhausted by fruitless attempts to inflate the lungs, the trachea must be opened. The unhappy parents are greatly to be pitied in these circumstances. Suddenly overwhelmed with despair, they may be unable to consent to, and unwilling to forbid, a procedure which, after all, holds forth a somewhat slender prospect of recovery.

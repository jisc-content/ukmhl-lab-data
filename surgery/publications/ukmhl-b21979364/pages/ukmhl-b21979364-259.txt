219 THROMBOSIS OF THE LATERAL SINUS. and dressed with wood-wool; but if no pus be found the wound must be entirely closed. Cerebellar abscess cannot always be differentiated from suppuration in the temporo-sphenoidal lobe, though in the former ease there is usually a marked and persistent retrac- tion of the head, and the headache and tenderness are more likely to be referred to the occipital region. When cerebellar abscess is suspected, a trephine opening should be made with its centre about an inch behind the external auditory meatus and a quarter of an inch below Reid’s base line. This will avoid all risk of opening up the lateral sinus, which, let it be borne in mind, winds from the region of the external occipital protuberance down the hinder part of the mastoid process. Thrombosis of the lateral sinus is another result of chronic septic otitis, and it is apt to be the beginning of a fatal pj’mmia. Ballance says that the condition may be recognised by an oscillating temperature, with repeated vomitings and rigors. There is also tenderness about the mastoid and occipital regions, and possibly a hardness along the upper part of the internal jugular vein. There is likely to be optic neuritis. The best chance for the child will consist in gouging away the mastoid process, exploring the lateral sinus (which lies to the posterior part of the process), tying the internal jugular in the middle of the neck, and washing through the upper part and the sinus with syringefuls of carbolic or mercuric lotion.

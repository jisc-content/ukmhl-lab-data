I PREFACE. It is hoped that, in the endeavour to compress within an allotted number of pages, an account of the entire subject of the Surgery of Infancy and Childhood, theory has not been unduly sacrificed to practice, nor clearness to con- densation. Thanks are tendered to Dr. Gee for permission to use sketches from the portfolio of the Hospital for Sick Children, for Figs. 28 and 29 ; to Mr. Thomas Smith for Fig. 39 ; to Dr. R. Lee for Fig. 13; and to Mr. Hutchinson for Fig. 16; and to a former House Physician, Dr. John Thomson (now of the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh), for making the drawing from which the chromo-lithograph, Plate I. Fig. 1, was executed. To a late Student of St. Mary’s Hospital, Mr. A. Sanders, I am indebted for the water-colour drawing from which the Frontispiece was made ; and to Dr. Macintyre, of Glasgow, for the beautiful photogram from which Plate V. has been prepared. In the matter of Development, reference has been made to Dalton’s “Human Physiology,” and to Quain’s “ Anatomy.”

TUMOURS. 1S6 to, even in the case of there being many chondromata, until scraping has been found ineffectual. Exostoses are of common occurrence in children. They are of cancellated tissue, and are due to the erratic develop- ment ot cartilage cells at the end of the diaphysis. They are specially apt to occur in rickety children, growing from islets of tem- porary cartilage which have been be- lated and shut off on account of the irregularity of the ossification. As the nodule grows, the base is converted into bone whilst its incrustation of tem- porary cartilage continues to advance. At last, when the epiphysis is ossified on to the shaft, and the length of the bone is completed, the incrustation also ossifies and the growth of the exostosis is ended. Such being their history, exostoses might be looked for at those diaphyseal ends where developmental activity is greatest. Thus, they are most often found at the knee-ends of the femur, tibia, and fibula (Fig. 26), and at the upper end of the humerus. As the diaphysis increases in length by deposits of bone at its epiphyseal end, the grow- ing exostosis is gradually carried farther and farther away from the joint. Often the exostoses are pedunculated, and a very large number may be found in the same child. There is frequently a strong history of heredity with them. In some cases the growth of the exostosis seems to check the normal growth of the diaphysis. (See Fig. 25.) Treatment.—Anxious parents may be assured that the growths are quite innocent, and that their period of increase is strictly limited. If, however, they are “in the way,” or interfere Avith joint, muscle, or nerve, a clean incision should be made down upon them and their bases cut smoothly oft with a chisel or sharp pliers.

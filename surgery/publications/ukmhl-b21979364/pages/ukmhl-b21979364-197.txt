157 ESTLANDER’S OPERA TION. heal after scraping ancl after the resection of a piece of the adjacent rib. The operation having been decided upon, the child is laid on a hot-water mattress and chloroform is dis- creetly administered. The finger is introduced through the existing wound, and the cavity is explored Avith a view to seeing Iioav many of the ribs over it aauII need resection. It is not unlikely that they will be the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth—two, four, or even six inches of each, according to the size of the cavity. There is, probably, less shock to the child if each rib is dealt Avith by a separate incision, as described above (page 153), rather than after the making of a long vertical incision, or the raising of a large flap. After the operation the child must be kept very quiet, and, if necessary, treated by stimulation and warmth. In the treatment of empyema, careful attention must be paid to diet, and Avine should be liberally administered. If necessary, extra food may be introduced into the stomach by the oesophageal tube (page 50). The drugs required AA'ill be quinine and iron, and, perhaps, small doses of opium. As soon after the operation as possible, the child should be got out of bed and into the fresh air. Gentle exercise helps the lung to expand, and it is permissible even before the discharge ceases. It is an error to confine the child to the sick-room, or even to the house, simply because he has an unhealed pleural abscess. Prognosis is for a time uncertain. The abscess cavity may quickly contract, especially if the evacuation have not been long postponed. But exhaustion, p}^semia, spinal caries,- tuberculosis, or albuminoid disease may intervene and prove fatal.

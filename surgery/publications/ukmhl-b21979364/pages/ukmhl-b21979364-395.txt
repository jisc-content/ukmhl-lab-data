355 CHAPTER XXY LATERAL CURVATURE OF THE SPINE. Lateral curvature of the spine (scoliosis) is not a disease ; it is a local expression of general enfeeblement. It is often found in the subjects of flat feet; and, like flat foot, is due primarily to a yielding of muscles and liga- ments under superimposed pressure—especially when, from one cause or another, that pressure is received obliquely. It is found chiefly in girls who are physically weak or rachitic, or in whom growth has advanced beyond strength and solidity, but it has no special association with tuberculosis. Girls with lateral curvature have often fallen into lolling habits Avhen standing, or when sitting at meals, at the pianoforte, or at lessons. Boys are but little liable to the deformity, as they possess greater physical strength and keep their muscles and other tissues vigorous by outdoor exercises. The children of the poor are less affected than are those of the upper classes, Avho take but little exercise and pass much of their,time sitting. Although the curvature is generally most marked between childhood and puberty, it usually begins quite early and progresses slowly. The more solid the vertebrEe become, the more slowly does the defect advance. At about the age of eighteen it has usually reached its maximum, and will probably get neither much better nor much worse, as the skeleton is then practically solidified. Attention may first be called to it by the mother noticing that a hip or shoulder is “ growing out ”; but as the child makes no complaint, surgical advice may not be sought until the deformity is but little amenable to treatment. In the early weeks of the deviation there is simply a yielding of feeble muscles and ligaments; but, later, Avhen the habit is confirmed, the intervertebral discs and the bones become misshapen, and a peculiar rotation is produced. A groAving or Aveakly girl, standing much in class, finds

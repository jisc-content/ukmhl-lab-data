432 TROCHANTERIC DISEASE. at about the eighteenth year. Sometimes it is detached as the result of direct violence or of muscular action. The separation may be conveniently treated by a bracketed outside splint, or by a Thomas’s hip-splint. Alter about three weeks massage should be employed, and the boy should gradually be allowed to re- gain his freedom. Acute septic ostitis attacking the trochanter will cause great local and constitutional disturbance (page 367). It had best be treated by free incision and scraping. The disease has to be distinguished from acute bursitis, and this can generally be done by pinching the trochanter between the finger and O thumb from before backwards. In either case incision is probably needed, and thus any doubt might promptly be cleared up. Tuberculous ( page 57 ) and syphilitic (page 91) inflammations of the trochanter are of rare oc- currence. They scarcely need separate description. If central necrosis, occur the surrounding bone will slowly and solidly thicken, and exploration by gouging will probably be called for. In Fig. 112 extensive tuberculous disease of the tro- chanteric epiphysis had determined the formation of a small sequestrum, which is represented by the white patch.

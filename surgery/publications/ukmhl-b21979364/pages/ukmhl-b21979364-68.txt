TRACHEOTOMY. 44 part. The outer part has two lateral limbs, and must he securely made. This outer tube is introduced by itself, the limbs being pressed together, so that the thin, flat end easily slips in between the blades of the dilator, even if the tracheal wound be small. A round-ended tube is apt to compress the trachea without entering it. The tube must not be too large, nor too much curved forward, lest it impinge against the front of the trachea. With the latter fault, pressure might bear against the front of the trachea, with, possibly, fatal complications. The tube need not completely fill the trachea, A useful size and shape is that shown in Fig. 2 ; it is not so much curved that Fig. 2.â€”Ordinary Bi-valve Tube and Method of Securing it. its end conies against the front of the trachea, and it is but slightly tapered. It is large enough when it admits the air without noise. For small children, the lumen of the outer tube, at the level of the plate, may be of about the size of an ordinary steel-pen holder, and, for larger children, of the size of a cedar-pencil. To the surgeon who is not in the habit of choosing tracheotomy-tubes this simple gauge, though laying no claim to accuracy, will be found not without value. It is well to keep several intermediate sizes in readiness. I prefer the old-fashioned bivalve tube,, as figured herewith, to all others. It is easily introduced, free from valid objection, and perfectly trustworthy. In a day or two it will be replaced by soft tube, or re- moved altogether. If the neck be swollen from diphtheritic inflammation, it will be necessary to have a long tube. Unless the inner tube be longer than the outer the end of the latter may

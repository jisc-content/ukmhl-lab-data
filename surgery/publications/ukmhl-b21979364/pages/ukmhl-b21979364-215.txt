ENCEPHALOCELE. 175 tumour during the progress of ossification, the interior of an ethmoidal meningocele may become at last completely cut off from the cavity of the cranium. It may give rise to symptoms resembling those of naso-pliaryngeal tumour. Encephalocele is a meningocele Avith the addition of some of the encephalon. If fluid intervene between the protruding brain substance and the membranes, the condition is termed hydro-encephalo-meningocele. A favourite situation of the protrusion is the occipital region, where the gap may allow of the escape of much of the cerebral hemispheres. The condi- tion is generally associated with internal hydrocephalus, and Fig. 33.â€”Large Occipital Encephalocele. some portion of the lateral ventricles, distended with fluid, may be extruded in the cerebral substance. If the tumour be translucent, it probably consists of dura mater with cerebro- spinal fluid only. If it be opaque, and if it pulsate, it is prob- ably an encephalocele (Fig. 33), but brain-tissue expanded by internal hydrocephalic may be translucent, as remarked above. The surgeon should pause before interfering with a tumour of suspicious nature over or near to a cranial suture. A meningocele at the root of the nose might be mistaken for a dermoid cyst or a deeply-seated nsevus. The situation of the tumour over a suture, the wide and deep connections of its base, the history, the strange appearance, and the absence of skin-staining, heip in the differentiation. Nevertheless, the diagnosis from mevus is not always easy, and time may be required to make it absolute; exploratory puncture should not be adopted. The meningocele is a congenital growth, and must occupy a definite site; it has not the spongy feel of

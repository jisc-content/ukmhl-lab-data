241 CHAPTER XVIII. SPINA BIFIDA. A vertebra has three primary centres of ossification, two for the laminre, one for the body. The laminae are fused in the root of the spinous process. If development be arrested, the spinal canal remains unclosed posteriorly {spina bifida), the mem- branes with the cerebro-spinal fluid protruding as a soft tumour â€”meningocele. It is a mesoblastic deficiency, and is found most often in the lower lumbar and sacral region, for there the laminae are last solidified. It is possibly caused by an increase in the amount of cerebro-spinal (subarachnoid) fluid within the spinal canal, whereby development is prevented; thus it is often associated with hydrocephalus. But whether the collection of serous fluid be the cause or the result of the spina bifida has not yet been determined. A dorsal dermoid cyst, from its exact median position (page 126), is sometimes mistaken for a meningocele, but it is more superficial and is not associated with the deficiency in the neural arches of the vertebrae. The coexistence of dorsal dermoid and spina bifida is occasionally met with. The most characteristic feature of the tumour is its exact median situation, and its firm attachment to the deep parts; it is rounded, but if a number of neural arches be unde- veloped, the base is elongated in the axis of the column. When not over-distended, stunted ridges of bone may be felt on either side of its root. The tumour may be so large at birth as to mislead the obstetrician as to the true nature of the presentation. When the child screams, some of the cerebral fluid is dis- . placed from the interior of the skull into the spinal canal and the tumour becomes more tense; by gentle compression of the tumour some of the fluid can be squeezed into the cerebro-spinal canal, with the effect of causing irregular mus- cular movements or convulsions, and of making the fontanelle bulge.

CHAPTER XIII. CERTAIN MALFORMATIONS IN HEAD AND NECK. Chronic hydrocephalus is a collection of fluid within the cerebral ventricles, the brain substance being greatly ex- panded ; the bones also are thin, and, with a strong light behind, the head may be actually translucent. The fluid may increase so as to cause separation of the cranial bones, and to leave wide, membranous sutures, the brain substance being represented by a cyst-like layer of nerve-tissue spread inside the ca- pacious cranium. The excess of fluid may be the result of a slow inflammation of the arachnoid, and of the lining of the lateral ventricles which may have existed during foetal life, or of a blocking of the cerebro- spinal opening. The face is small and old- looking, and the forehead and head are exces- sively large (Fig. 31). The child has no physical or intellectual vigour, and probably falls an early victim to convulsions or to pulmonary disease. The acquired variety is generally the result of obstruction to the venous return from the skull; it may be caused by the pressure of a cerebral tumour on the veins of Galen, or by obstruction of the foramen of Majendie. Treatment.—Drainage of the cerebral ventricles, with the view of warding off compression due to intra-ventricular hydrocephalus, is a rational procedure, though most of the children so operated on have succumbed; but according to Dr. Keen the probable explanation of the failure has been the too rapid escape of the fluid. Broca advises Keen’s method of thrusting in a trocliar 1.[ inch above and behind the external auditory meatus, and in the direction of the opposite external meatus. Then, with a continuous aseptic drainage, there is a chance, provided the skull-wall is still soft, that improvement may ensue ; but the chance is necessarily a very poor one.

4(57 CHAPTER XXXIV. DEFORMITIES OF THE FOOT. Supernumerary toes, like supernumerary fingers, may be traced to hereditary transmission. Unless the additional toe be in the way it may be left uninterfered with. If there happen to be several superfluous toes, trimming may be advisable. In the case of a toe being attached by simple fibrous tissue and skin, the connection may be severed. Webbed toes should be left alone. Pes gigas is congenital hypertrophy of part or the whole of the foot. The skin is coarse, the subdermal tissue is in- filtrated with fat, dilated veins, capillaries and lymphatics, and the bones are overgrown. Sometimes only one or two toes are thus enlarged; sometimes the overgrowth extends up the leg. The treatment should consist in even and gentle pressure with an elastic cotton roller, or, if necessary, with a fine Martin’s bandage. Compression should be carried out with care and perseverance, and amputa- tion should be resorted to only in extreme cases. Arrest of development may affect the whole, or part of one, or both feet; the surgeon can do nothing to improve the condition. Annular constrictions may be found in the limbs, extending as a narrow groove almost to the bone. They are errors of development (Fig. 115), possibly due to a twisting of the umbilical cord; they are not due to the contraction, as has been suggested, of intra-uterine inflammatory deposits. The opposed surfaces may sometimes be denuded and the edges adjusted by suture. Club foot may be congenital or acquired ; of the former variety, the commonest is that in which the heel is raised Fig. 115.—Congenital Annular Constriction.

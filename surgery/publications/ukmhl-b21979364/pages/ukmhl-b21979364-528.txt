484 CHAPTER XXXV. DISEASES OF THE FOOT. Like the vertebra, the tarsal bones consist almost entirely of spongy tissue ; they are much exposed to injury and, there- fore, to tuberculous inflammation. They are, moreover, separ- ated by folds of synovial membrane which are ready to become inflamed from any strain or blow. The child com- plains of his foot “ hurting ” or “ aching,” and at first there may be no local indication of disease; but the parts soon become swollen and, perhaps, the skin grows dusky. In due course an abscess forms and is incised, or, effecting its own discharge an indolent sinus remains, from which a thin fluid is con- stantly oozing. The skin-opening is in time encircled with a ring of unhealthy granulations and becomes adherent to the subjacent tissues, even to the bones. Probing such a sinus distresses the child and, as it is already obvious that diseased bone exists in the depths, the probe affords no fresh information. Nor is it necessary that the surgeon inquire too closely as to Avhich bone or joint is specially diseased. The information can be only obtained at the expense of harmful examination and will in no way alter the treatment. At last the rarefying ostitis destroys the tissue invaded and nothing remains but the thin shell of compact bone filled with granulation-tissue. Chronic in- flammatory disease of the foot, whether started by a definite injury or not, is tuberculous. The a stray alo-scaphoid joint is, on account of its size and range of movement, specially apt to be attacked, and the astragalus being invaded, there is a great risk of the disease extending to the ankle joint. Indeed, in whatever part of the tarsus the inflammation may arise, it is apt to ignore all anatomical boundaries and, gradually spreading from

92 -SYPHILIS. unable to move the arm; the shoulder was swollen and tender. There was no history of injury; the mother had had four miscarriages, all at about the seventh month, and this child, though born at full time, had “snuffles.” Syphilitic inflammation was suspected, but, in the absence of more direct evidence, a tenta- tive but futile treatment was adopted. On a course of mercury, the child im- proved, and the thickening and paral}vsis entirely disappeared. Pseudo-paralysis must be carefully distinguished from infantile paralysis— a disease of somewhat later months, and one which is characterised by the sud- denness of its onset. The neighbour- hood of the joints is, however, sound in infantile paralysis, and the range of movements is not diminished. The way in which the trouble clears . up under mercury renders the diagnosis absolute. The actual condition is a growth of syphilitic granulation-tissue; a gumma, in fact, occupies the end of the dia- physis, and though no suppuration occurs, the granuloma may extend across the epiphyseal cartilage and produce a sepa- ration of the epiphysis. The epiphyses unite again on the child being put under mercurial treatment. In a fatal case, post-mortem examination showed the affected articulations to be full of pus, the ill-organised syphilitic granuloma having invaded the joint and then broken down. Fig. 11, from a specimen in the Hunterian Museum, shows the syphilitic granulation-tissue stretching across the lower end of a humeral diaphysis and stretching up beneath the periosteum in a ring around the shaft. It was, doubtless, associated with tenderness near the elbow. Had the gumma broken down, the epiphysis would have eventually been Fig. 11. — Humerus of Infant that died of Hereditary Syphilis. Sub-periosteal gumma at lower end of dia- physis extended across line of epiphyseal car- tilage, and caused ■ enlargement near epiphysis. (From Museum of Royal College of Surgeons.)

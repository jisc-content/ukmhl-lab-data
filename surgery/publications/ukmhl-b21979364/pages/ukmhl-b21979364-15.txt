ARTHUR LUCAS, ESQ., CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE OF MANAGEMENT OF THE HOSPITAL FOR SICK CHILDREN, GREAT ORMOND STREET. Dear Mr. Lucas, I think that the outcome of work (even though purely Surgical) which 1ms been clone at the Hospital over the welfare of which you watch with devotion and success, cannot be wholly devoid of interest to you. May I, therefore, offer you the Dedication of this book 1 The fact of your not being a member of my Profession would be an assurance to me— though a superfluous one—that you would pass gently over its technical imperfections. Yours very truly, THE AUTHOR. London, May, 1897.

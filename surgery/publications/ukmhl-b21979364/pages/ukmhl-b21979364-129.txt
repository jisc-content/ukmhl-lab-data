93 DIFFUSE OSTITIS. detached ; but if, on the other hand, the granulation-tissue had become organised, the end of the diaphysis would have been left permanently thickened. Diffuse ostitis may cause hypertrophy and sclerosis of the bones. In one case the tibia was greatly thickened, and in- creased in length by one inch and a half, but, as a rule, both tibice are more or less affected. Hypernutrition of the peri- osteum and bone determines the in- crease in circumference, and of the end of the diaphysis, the increase in length. Various bones may be affected at the same time, and subperiosteal gummatous abscesses may quietly form and break, exposing a denuded surface of bone, which, on account of the mild- ness of the local disturbance, is slow in exfoliating. The long bones are curved in syphilitic hypertrophy (Fig. 12), in a manner suggestive of the deformity of ostitis deformans in the adult, and they are often attacked with patches of caries necrotica. As Ashby and Wright remark, it is sometimes very difficult to differ- entiate between syphilitic and tuber- culous disease of bone. Each begins quietly as an ostitis or periostitis, and each is apt to entail a growth of un- healthy granulation-tissue, which may invade the surrounding tissue, and may cause fracture of a bone. In each case the granulation-tissue would be apt to break down into a thin fluid, and, even at this stage it is often difficult to dif- ferentiate. Clinically there is little diff- erence between a tuberculous gumma and a syphilitic gumma; but it may be taken as a good working rule that syphilis prefers the large and long bones, and tuberculosis the short ones. A highly important clinical feature in these cases is that the sharp anterior border of the tibia is blunted and widened. The excessive conveyance Fig. 12.—Diffuse Syphilitic Inflammation of Ulna.

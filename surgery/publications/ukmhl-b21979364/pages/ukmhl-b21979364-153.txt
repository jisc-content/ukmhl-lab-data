117 CHAPTER VIII. TUMOURS. As might have been anticipated, growths upon the type- of embryonic connective tissue, sarcomata, are common in childhood—they are more likely to occur in tissues which are passing through the developmental stages than in those which are permanently differentiated. Like the embryonic tissues upon the type of which they are founded, sarcomata are met with of several varieties. The round-celled sarcoma is the representative of the lowest form of development, but of the highest malignancy. The giant-celled, or myeloid sarcoma is the representative of the medulla of embryonic bone ; it is the least malignant form, and the usual variety of a central sarcoma of bone. Periosteal sarcoma generally consists of spindle-cells, which enter the blood-vessels far more readily than the giant cells, and, therefore, more quickly infect the viscera, especially the lungs. Sarcomata differ from the tissues on the type of which they are formed, in that they show no desire for the higher development. Were it otherwise, they might grow into fibrous tissue or muscle, and so become harmless elements in the parts which they infest. The sarcomatous cells actually form the thin-walled vessels of the tumour, and, readily entering the blood-stream, they become quickly dis- seminated—especially the small round and the spindle- celled varieties. Inasmuch as the cellular elements of the tumour are carried away by the veins, the secondary visceral deposits are almost certainly in the lungs. They have a much less direct association with the lymphatic vessels; nevertheless, it is by no means unusual for them to implicate the glands, and in sarcoma of the testicle such an implication is almost invariable. Sarcomata are painless, though, if they be growing quickly, there may be discomfort from tension of sensory nerves. Sometimes the growths are hard, sometimes soft, but they are generally smooth and rounded. They are

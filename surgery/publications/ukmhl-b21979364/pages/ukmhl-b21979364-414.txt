374 ACUTE SEPTIC DIAPIIYSITIS. thumb, the doctoi' would have found that the disease Avas in the bone, and not in, though very close to, the joint. Septic diaphysitis is sometimes taken for erysipelas. Each is an infective blood-disease, and when the diaphysis con- cerned is superficial, as in the tibia, the extreme local swelling and the marked redness of the skin may, Avith the background of general symptoms, lead to error. But gentle pressure of the diaphysis between the finger and thumb Avould shoAv that the swelling and tenderness Avere evidently in the bone and peri- osteum, and not in the bright red skin. Subsequent condition of the bone.—If the necrotic diaphysis is removed without needless delay, the periosteum, Avhich is lined Avitli granulation-tissue, Avill form a neAv shaft, bearing a close resemblance to the ori- ginal. Sometimes, hoAvever, it is but a short and clumsy imitation. If, as the result of the Haver- sian thrombosis, a sequestrum be permitted to linger in the interior of the diaphysis, it be- comes the source of constant irritation and hypersemia, the result being that the shaft is thickened by deposit from the deep layer of the periosteum, and gradually lengthened by the organisation of chronic inflammatory deposit upon the diaphyseal side of the junction- cartilage. If, however, the groAving tissue at the end of the diaphysis be completely destroyed by the septic inflamma- tion, or the disturbance cause premature fusion of the shaft and epiphysis, inevitable shortness of the bone results (Fig. 89).

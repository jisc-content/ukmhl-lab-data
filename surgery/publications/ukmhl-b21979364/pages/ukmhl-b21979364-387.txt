In the choice and application of a truss too much should not be left to the instrument maker. He views the matter from a purely mechanical standpoint, and he rarely has anatomical or surgical knowledge to enlighten him. Often, when the hernia is associated with a hydrocele, the steady pressure of a truss may cure both ; but if fluid interfere with the pad, it may be withdrawn before the truss is applied, care being taken that no bowel is in the sac. For tender infants, spring-trusses are ill-suited; for them Lund’s plan of treatment should first be tried. A thick folded skein of Berlin wool should have the loop-end laid Fig. SO.—Wool Truss for Infant. over the emptied inguinal canal—the other ends being carried spike-wise above the opposite pubes, across the front of the abdomen, round the loins and back, and over the hip of the weak side. This running end is then passed through the inguinal loop, carried round the inner side of the thigh, and over the buttock, to be firmly secured to that part of the skein which is already just above the great trochanter. The infant can be washed with this truss on, a fresh one being subsequently applied. The arrangement is well shown in the accompanying illustration from Pye’s book (Fig. 80). When used with patience and intelligence, I have known this suffice; but for a severe case, of course, it will not be enough. I have recently had a male infant under my care in whom an inguinal hernia had been produced by applying an appropriate band for the treatment of a troublesome um- bilical rupture.

162 CHAPTER XII. INFANTILE PARALYSIS—PSEUDO-HYPERTROPHIC PARALYSIS TETANY—SPASTIC PARALYSIS -NEURO-MIMESIS—SPORADIC CRETINISM, ETC. Infantile paralysis. Pathology.—The nerves that govern the nutrition, and regulate the movements of the muscles of the trunk and extremities, are associated with multi-polar cells in the anterior horn of the grey matter of the spinal cord. When acute inflammation (anterior g)olio-myelitis ttoXios, “ grey ” ; //,ueXd<?, “ marrow ”) attacks this grey tissue, or haemorrhage occurs into it, the associated muscles are thrown out of working order. When serious extravasations take place, the destruction of the cells, and of the delicate fibres connected with them, may be irremediable, the para- lysed muscles becoming quickly and permanently wasted. This form of paralysis is not confined to infancy, or even to childhood, but by far the greatest number of cases occur before the fourth year. The paralysis may come on without warning, and in a typically healthy child, or it may be preceded by a short feverish attack, or by convulsions; it may be accompanied with pain and tenderness in the limbs. Sometimes the attack is associated with vomiting. If, as often happens, the child be cutting a tooth at the time, the premonitory symp- toms may be attributed to “ dentition.” And, there being absolutely nothing to draw attention to the actual seat of mischief, the disease is not diagnosed. The medical atten- dant may find himself blamed when, later, as the child begins to crawl about again, paralysis is for the first time discovered. The practitioner who is ever prepared for polio- myelitis, is least likely to be taken by surprise. As a rule, more muscles are at first affected than are ultimately left paralysed. This is due to the disturbance of outlying cells being only temporary. In one case, all four extremities were paralysed; gradually the arms recovered, but both thighs

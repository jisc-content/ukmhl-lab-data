223 OPERATION. In a severe case, the first question which the surgeon asks himself is, Can the intermaxillary bone be eventually used for filling the front of the palatine cleft ? For if so, the subsequent operation upon the palatine fissure will be sim- plified. There are, however, two fallacies in connection with the thrusting back of the intermaxillary bone : unless it be pushed well home, it may exert a pressure against the line of operation in the new lip, and so obstruct union. Secondly, Fig. 49. Fig. 50. Double Hare-lip and Cleft Palate. Intermaxillary bone (or part of it) and prolabium attached to tip of nose. (From a Photograph.) when thrust into the cleft, it may fail to take up a secure attachment, and may prevent that narrowing of the palatine fissure which a successful operation on the lip may be hoped in some slight degree to effect. If double hare-lip be uncomplicated with intermaxillary prominence, the mucous membrane must be dissected from the entire circumference of the median flap as well as from the opposed borders of the lip ; but from one side, or even trom both sides of the lip, thick, useful flaps must be borrowed for deflection across the middle line. This is an important economy of tissue, only that which is found superfluous on adjusting the vivified surfaces being cut away, so that the natural fulness of the lip is preserved. If the bone be pushed back the central incisors will grow irregularly; and if the dentist cannot then improve their position, he may extract them. Sometimes the sides of the process need trimming before it can be pushed into the cleft, in which case the margins of the cleft should also be pared.

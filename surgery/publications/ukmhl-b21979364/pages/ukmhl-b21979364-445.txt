405 CHAPTER XXIX. HIP-JOINT DISEASE. The hip joint differs from most other joints in this, that the end of a diaphysis enters into its formation. In Fig. 99 A A represents the attachment of the capsular ligament into the anterior intertrochanteric line; the entire area of the junction of the diaphysis, and, e e, epiphysis, and a con- siderable amount of the diaphysis thus being within the capsule. , At the very end of the dia- physis there is a considerable amount of delicate bone-tissue, and this young bone is extremely prone to tuberculous and to septic inflammation. The hip joint is unfortunate in the fact that it is deeply shrouded in soft tissues, and is thus placed comparatively far out of surgical reach. The term hip joint disease is con- venient in that it conveys a definite idea of a series of pathological changes which frequently affect that joint in childhood. It should not suggest, however, that these morbid conditions differ from those which may he found in other articula- tions. It usually begins as a tuberculous ostitis or synovitis, the head or the intra-articular part of the femoral diaphysis being most usually attacked. In the latter instance the head of the bone is apt to be eventually cast adrift in the interior of the capsule where, on exploring the joint, it may be found bathed in pus and much eroded. Primary disease of the acetabulum is of far less frequent occurrence. Though one cannot affirm that hip-joint disease is in- variably the result of injury, still it may generally be learnt that some weeks or months before the trouble began the child had met with some definite injury to the hip.

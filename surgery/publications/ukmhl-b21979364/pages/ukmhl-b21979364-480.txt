436 CHAPTER XXXI. DISEASE OF THE KNEE JOINT. Osteo-arthritis (chronic rheumatic arthritis) is occa- sionally met with in children in the knee as well as in other joints. Deformity steadily increases, and, in the few cases that I have met with, treatment has been of slight avail. At the time of writing I have a boy under my care at St. Mary’s Hospital with masses of new bone on the margins of the articular surfaces of his knee joint. The osteo-arthritis followed an injury; but the other knee is also affected, and I fear that the disease is progressive. (See Trans. Soc. Med. Chir., 1896, for Dr. Still’s Essay.) Pysemic arthritis may he caused by gonorrhoea, con- junctivitis, osteomyelitis, or any other septic inflammation. Thus it sometimes comes on as a sequel to ulceration of the throat, the result of scarlet fever or diphtheria, several joints being, perchance, affected in its course. (See page 371.) Acute synovitis is frequently met with after a fall, a wrench of the fibrous capsule, or after exposure to wet or cold. It may come on with extreme rapidity, and with the effusion of much fluid, so that the patella is pushed from the trochlear surface of the femur. The distended capsule causes a fulness on each side of the patella, and on each side of the upper part of its ligament; there is also a bulging under the quadriceps extensor. The depressions which are normally found at the knee are obliterated—a delicate diagnostic sign, for it is often manifest before effusion into the joint can be detected by palpation. Atrophy of the thigh and leg quickly supervenes, and the joint becomes fixed. In estimating the amount of the muscular wasting in the case of a fat child, absolute measure- ment with a tape may give little tangible result. A far better way of appreciating the flabby and wasted condition is by encircling the leg in the firm grasp of the finger and thumb, and carefully noting by how much the tips of those digits fail

452 CHAPTER XXXII. DISEASE OF THE SHOULDER AND ELBOW JOINTS, ETC. The shoulder joint.—The head of the humerus is held against the shallow glenoid cavity in the loose embrace of the capsular ligament. Thus, practically, every movement of the arm is unlimited, and the scapula plays freely over the chest, so that violence is little likely to affect the joint. A not uncommon cause of synovitis or arthritis is pulling or swinging a child by the arm. Pain is complained of, but as the joint is thickly covered by the deltoid, and no redness of the skin supervenes, the mother, seeing nothing amiss, gives the matter no further heed. The boy meanwhile uses the arm as little as possible, putting on his dress cautiously; with this rest the joint may recover, provided that the child be healthy. If the surgeon were called in, as he should have been, he would probably have found the skin over the shoulder warmer than on the other side, and the joint swollen, elastic, and tender. If he abducted the arm he would have found that the scapula moved with it—un- mistakable evidence of stiffness of the joint. The muscles quickly waste and leave the bony eminences unduly prominent (page 412). Treatment.—Complete rest must be enforced, and while the joint is painful, the child should not be allowed to disturb it by passing his arm through his sleeve. In this way the arm is effectively rested, for he must wear it beneath his clothes. It had better be raised in a sling and fixed to the side, and he should not have free use of it until all swelling and pain have disappeared. (For the means of confining the arm refer to page 383.) Suppuration may supervene if the child be unhealthy, or if the violence which set up the synovitis were extreme. Suppuration in the shoulder joint demands early relief of tension; unless the matter be afforded free escape, the joint may be complete!}' destroyed. If in any case there be

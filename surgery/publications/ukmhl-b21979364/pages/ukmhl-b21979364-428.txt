383 FRACTURE THROUGH LOWER EPIPHYSIS. elbow, by a wheel passing over it, or by a fall upon the outstretched hand (Fig. 91). Diagnosis.—If the elbow be swollen and painful, an anaes- thetic should be administered and a deliberate examination made. It may be noticed that the front of the fore-arm is shortened, and that there is a projection behind the lower end of the humerus. On grasping the limb above and below the joint a strange lateral movement is detected. The lower fragment, if previously dis- placed, can be easily restored, though it is apt to slip back again. The movements of pronation and supination are permitted, and the top of the olecranon process is still in the normal horizontal line with the condyles of the humerus. Now, in the dislocation, as shown in Fig 92, the top of the olecranon is raised above the condyles of the humerus. The fracture is not necessarily accompanied with displacement. The injury is not likely to be overlooked if the shaft be grasped with one hand and the condyles with the other, and the characteristic lateral movement be looked for. In the case of the backward dislocation being incomplete, the elevation of the olecranon will not be characteristic ; it.s absence, therefore, does not exclude luxa- tion. In the case of there being uncer- tainty as to the exact nature of an injury near a joint, a skiagram proves in- tensely interesting and helpful. Indeed, one’s only fear is lest the too frequent resort to the X rays should eventually Fig. 94.—Elbow Splint susrerest that diagnostic skill in obscure applied.

Treatment.—The hand and forearm should be evenly bandaged, and a layer of cotton-wool should be secured around the flexed elbow joint, the bandage being subsequently con- tinued up the arm: A flannel splint having been already cut to the paper pattern, and prepared with gypsum, should Fig. 93.—Pattern for Elbow Splint.

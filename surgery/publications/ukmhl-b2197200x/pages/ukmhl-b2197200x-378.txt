What is commonly known as the "Wheeling" ambulance, from having been first constructed at Wheeling, Virginia, from a design of General Eose- crans, soon came into very general use. It is drawn by two horses, and carries ten or twelve persons sitting, or two or three sit- ting and two lying down. It combines lightness and strength.

It has been recommended as the regulation ambulance for the U. S. Army. Its plan is exhibited and sufficiently explained in the accompanying plate. Throughout the war, the system of rapidly removing the wounded to permanent hospitals, remote from the scene of hostilities, was uniformly adopted. To accomplish this, trains of hospital railway cars were constructed, and steamers were fitted up as hospital transports, or were built expressly for this service. The hospital cars were furnished with movable berths or litters, and in each train one car was provided with facilities for cooking, and with a dispensary. Tig.

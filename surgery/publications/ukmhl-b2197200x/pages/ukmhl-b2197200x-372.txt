S. A., on account of secondary haemorrhage from a branch of the left in- ternal iliac. The hcemorrhage resulted from a gunshot wound of the pelvis, and oc- curred on the fifteenth and again on the twenty-third day. On the second bleeding, the internal iliac was tied; but the haemorrhage was not controlled, and the main trunk was secured. The patient survived two days, and the bleeding did not recur. The appearance of the parts is represented in vol. i. p. 5 of Photographs of Surgical Cases, S. G. 0., and the preparation is preserved as Specimen No. 3464, A. M. M. The second operation was performed by Acting Assistant Surgeon Isham, U. S. A., for a false con- secutive aneurism of the anterior trunk of the right internal iliac, resulting from a bayonet stab through the ischiatic notch. Seven months after the wound was inflicted the rupture of the sac appeared imminent, and the operation was imperative. The patient survived four days. An occluding clot, extending to the bifurcation of the aorta, was found above the ligature. There was no peritonitis. The third operation was done at the Ward Hospital, Newark, New Jersey, for an aneurismal varix, following a stab with a penknife in the left thigh, which opened a communication between the femoral artery and vein. The patient died of peritonitis in five days. The injected vessels constitute Specimen No. 3597, A. M. M., and are represented in Photograph No. 74, A. M. M. Two cases are recorded of deligation of the internal iliac for secondary hsemor- rhage after gunshot wounds. Both terminated fatally. Of the ligations of the external iliac, 2 recovered. One of them was the case of Pri- vate Smith, already related (p. 49), in which amputation at the hip-joint had been pre- viously performed. The second was the case of Sergeant Ziders, Co. I, 53d Pennsylva- nia Vols., who received a severe flesh wound of the right thigh at Gettysburg, July 3d,

38 EXTRACTS FROM OFFICIAL REPORTS tents were removed to new sites every second day, and the tents fumigated daily; disinfectants were constantly kept in the cholera tents, and all vomited and other matters disinfected as soon as discharged. The drinking water was treated with permanganate of potash before use. To the free use of disinfectants in the cholera tents and sinks, I attribute the immunity from the dis- ease enjoyed by the nurses and attendants. No case of cholera occurred among them after I took charge. I desire to bear testi- mony to the energy and zeal displayed by the medical officers on duty with me at the post, Acting Assistant Surgeons Chase and Renick. They did their duty. Hospital Steward Darling, U. S. A., a recently enlisted steward, also deserves commendation. The nurses and attendants in the cholera wards were almost all of them negroes. I was very much surprised at their fidelity; they placed great faith in disinfectants, and after their use they seemed to have no fear of the disease. In conclusion, I desire to state that I do not claim that cholera originated, de novo, at Fort Marker; but, in the absence of any certain proof of its importation, save the existence of the disease at Fort Riley last year, with the one isolated case mentioned this year, and the free communication with that post this spring, together with the known tendency of the disease to progress westward, I have deemed it proper to enumerate the causes which, under some circumstances, might be considered sulBcient to originate the disease.

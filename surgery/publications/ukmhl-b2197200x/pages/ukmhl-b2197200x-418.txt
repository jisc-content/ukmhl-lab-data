118 DIARRHOEA AND DYSENTERY. exact, and was bestowed by many surgeons on the same affection which others called diarrhoea. Hence it has been thought advisable, in considering the figures, to group together all cases reported under these heads. The extreme frequency of diarrhoea and dysentery makes it most important to under- stand these disorders. They constitute more than one-fourth of all the cases of disease reported during the period under consideration. The annual number of cases for the whole army was greater than three-fourths of the mean strength, and next, after camp fever, they were the chief cause of mortality from disease. The total number of cases reported during the first year was 215,214, with 1194 deaths; during the second year 510,461 cases and 10,366 deathsâ€”the total, 725,675 cases and 11,560 deaths. It will be seen that the proportionate mortality of the second year is by far the greatest, show- ing the prevalence of cases of a more formidable type. The following table presents the number of cases and deaths as actually reported under each of the heads above mentioned: TABLE XXiy.

The mortality was 4 per 1000 of strength during the first year and 16 during the second; the disease being just four times more fatal during the second year than the first. TABLE XXY.

Besides developing intermittent fever and complicating other diseases, such as camp fever and diarrhoea, the malarial influence manifests itself with considerable fre- quency among troops exposed to its action by the development of a peculiar form of anaemia, which may be designated Chronic Malarial Poisoning. This condition, attended usually with enlargement of the spleen and frequently with an increase in the number of the white corpuscles of the blood, manifests itself externally by languor, feebleness, and pallor, attended commonly with neuralgic pains, and, as it actually oc- curred among our troops, often complicated by slight scorbutic symptoms. Attacks of fever, pneumonia, or other acute diseases occurring among patients in this condition are peculiarly apt to prove fatal. A yellowish complexion is a frequent phenomenon in the form of anaemia here referred to, and often amounts to decided jaundice. Mild epidemics of jaundice, running a course of from two to six or eight weeks, and usually terminating in recovery, have also been of frequent occurrence among our troops in malarial regions. That this form of the affection also stands related to the malarial poison, is shown by the fact that, as a general rule, it was most common in those localities in which intermittents were most frequent. In Tables X. and XI. jaundice will be found reported among diseases of the digestive organs. The number of cases reported during the first year was 10,929, during the second year 31,640, mak- ing in all 42,569 cases. The deaths were only 40 during the first year and 121 during the second, or 161 in all, which is but one death in 264 cases. Of the large number of cases reported, only 24 during the first year and 85 during the second occurred in the Pacific region J none of these cases died. DIARRHCEA AND DYSENTERY. These disorders were reported under the four headsâ€”Acute Diarrhoea, Chronic Diar- rhoea, Acute Dysentery, and Chronic Dysentery. The words diarrhoea and dysentery were somewhat loosely used during the war. The disease most generally called Chronic Diarrhoea was, in fact, usually an affection of the large intestine, which was thickened, softened, and often ulcerated. The term dysentery would have been more

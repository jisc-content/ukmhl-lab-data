The experience of M. Jules Roux, in the Italian war, seems to prove conclusively that secondary amputations at the hip-joint are less dangerous than primary ones. As to the method of operating, it may be observed that the anterior single flap procedure has of late been generally preferred.* Amputations of the lower extremity are illustrated at the Army Medical Museum by numerous casts, drawings, and photographs, by 9 specimens of shattered femurs removed by amputation at the hip-joint, and by 211 specimens of the diseases of the * Since this report was put in print, two additional cases of amputation at the hip-joint have been reported. In the case of Private F. Kelb, Co. H, 7th New York Vols., whose right femur was fractured at Fredericksburg, by a musket-ball, in December, 1862, Dr. R. F. Weir amputated at the hip joint, at St. Luke's ITospital, New York, on June 7th, 186.5, on account of necrosis of the entire femur. The stump nearly healed; but the patient died October 4th, 186.5, of pulmonary tuberculosis. On October 12th, 1865, Surgeon E. Bently, U. S. Vols., amputated at the hip- joint, in the case of Private Lemon, 6th Maryland Vols., on account of necrosis of the left femur, resulting from a gunshot fracture of the upper third, received at the battle of the Wilderness, May 5th, 1864. The patient was in a satisfactory condition on November 24th, 1865. (Specimen 4386, A. M. M.)

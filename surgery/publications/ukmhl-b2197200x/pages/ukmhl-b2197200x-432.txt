INFLAMMATORY DISEASES OF THE RESPIEATORT ORGANS. 130 The proportion of deaths to cases was likewise greater in the Central than in the Atlantic, and in this than in the Pacific region, and, as already intimated, it was greater during the second year than during the first. In the Atlantic region there was one death to every 123 cases during the first year, one to every 71 during the second; in the Central region one to every 31 cases during the first year, one to every 18 during the second; in the Pacific region one to every 291 cases during the first year, one to every 211 during the second. The average for all regions and both years was one death to every 38 cases. TABLE XXXIII. Relation between Cases and Deaths of Inflammatory Diseases of the Respiratory Organs.

On the Atlantic coast the number of cases taken sick each month gradually increased from July, 1861, to January, 1862, after which it diminished to August, 1862, increased till December, and then diminished through 1863 till the close of the fiscal year in June, with the exception of an irregular increase in March. In the Central region the dis- ease pursued an essentially parallel wave, and this was the case during the second year in the Pacific region. In the Pacific region during the first year, however, the wave was less regular. The following tables exhibit these relationships in detail: TABLE XXXIY.

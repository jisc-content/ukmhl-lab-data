MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION OF THE WOUNDED. 83 At the beginning of the war, the one-horse ambulances, designed by Surgeon Gen- eral Finley and Surgeon Coolidge, and the four-horse ambulances, designed by Surgeon Tripler, were chiefly employed. The former were intended to transport two wounded men in a recumbent position. The latter accommodated eight men, lying down. The beds in all of these ambu- lances were movable, and could be used as hand-litters. The one-horse ambulances were too frail for the rough roads on which they were Fig. 83.—The " Coolidgo" ambulance. Fia. 84.—Side view of the "Tripler" ambulance.

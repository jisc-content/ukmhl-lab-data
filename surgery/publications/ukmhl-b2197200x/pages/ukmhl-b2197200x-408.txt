CAMP FEVER. liU 6315; during the second year, 138,641^ cases and 13,144 deaths,â€”the total for the two years being 213,260 cases and 19,459 deaths. The distribution among the several affections included in the statistical reports is shown in Table XII. TABLE XII.

In a general way, it may be said that each year about one-quarter of the men suffered from some form of the fever, and that the deaths amounted to about two per cent, of the strength. The whole number of deaths from these fevers during the first year was nearly one-half the total mortality from disease; during the second year, owing to the increased mortality from other diseases, and esjaecially from diarrhoea and dysentery, only about one-third the total mortality from disease, though still maintaining nearly the same ratio to strength. The ratio of cases and deaths to strength for each year, and for the average of the two years, is shown in the following table: TABLE XIIL Total Number of Cases and Deaths from Camp Fever for the first two years of the war, with the annual ratio per 1000 of mean strength. Year ending June 30, 1862 Year ending .June 30, 1863 For the two years Taken sick. Died. Annual ratio of cases per 1000 of mean strengtli.

In the Atlantic region, during both years, the number of cases was somewhat less than one-fourth the strength; the deaths for each year about seventeen per 1000 of strength.

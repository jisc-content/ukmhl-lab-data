76 SURGICAL OPERATIONS, Excisions in the Continuity of the Long Bones of the Extremities.â€”The great surgeons who have done most towards substituting excision for amputation in gunshot injuries of the joints have almost unanimously condemned excisions of the continuity of the long bones in the treatment of gunshot fractures. The surgical histories of the Cri- mean war, of the Schleswick Holstein campaigns, and of the Indian mutiny, record a few successes in resections of the shafts of the humerus, the tibia, and the bones of the forearm; but this class of operations could scarcely be considered as admitted among the established and approved procedures of surgery. The late war has furnished ample materials for arriving at definite conclusions on this subject, and for determining how far these measures can claim to be included in that true conservatism which has for its first object the saving of life, and refuses to imperil lives in order to save limbs. These materials are yet to be thoroughly analyzed. So far as examined, their evi- dence is, on the whole, unfavorable to excisions in the continuity. A synopsis of the results at present attained is presented in the following table: Table, giving the Number of Cases of Excisions for Gunshot Injuries in the Continuity of the Bones of the Extremities, from the Commencement of the War to July, 1864, and the Besults as far as ascertained. Excisions in the continuity of the Humerus Excisions in the continuity of the Radius Excisions in the continuity of the Ulna Excisions in the continuity of both Radius and Ulna. Excisions of the Metacarpal Bones Excisions in the continuity of the Femur Excisions in the continuity of the Tibia Excisions in the continuity of the Fibula Excisions in the continuity of both Tibia and Fibula. Excisions of the Metatarsal Bones Totals After excisions of portions of the shaft of the humerus for gunshot fractures, a number of patients have certainly obtained very useful limbs. But the mortality after the operation is 3 per cent, greater than after amputation of the arm. The 52 preparations at the Army Medical Museum, illustrating this resection, indicate the fre- quency with which it is followed by secondary amputation or a fatal result. Excision in the continuity of both bones of the forearm has a larger mortality ratio than amputation of the forearm. The specimens at the Museum and the records afford emphatic arguments against formal excisions of the shaft of the femur. With one exception, the few cases that recovered were those in which, after the removal of detached fragments, the least amount of operative interference had been practised. The mortality rate after excisions of the tibia and fibula is less than after ampu- tation, as the statistics stand; but the number of cases in which the result is still pending is unusually large. There have been a few cases in which portions of the lower jaw, the body of the Died. RecoTcred. Amputa^ tions ulti- mately re- quired. Result not yet deter- mined. Total.

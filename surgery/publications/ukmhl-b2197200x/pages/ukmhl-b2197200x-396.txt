COMPARATIVE FREQUENCY OF THE SEVERAL DISEASES. 98 but this is not the case. These returns are prepared for military, not for medical pur- poses. The monthly returns represent the number "present sick," but not the number "absent;" and under the head "present sick" (i.e. on side report), they include those who are really "present wounded." The tri-monthly returns, indeed, represent the number "absent sick" as well as those "present sick;" but under the term sick, as in the monthly returns, both sick and wounded are included. All ratios hitherto compiled, and published unofficially, which purport to be based on the returns in the Adjutant General's Office, are open to this objection, that they include the wounded with the sick, and are therefore to be regarded as wholly valueless in forming a notion of the health of the army. The following table of con- stant sickness rates extends only from October 1st, 1862, to June 30th, 1863. It com- pares the health of the troops in the three regions. The figures include only those under treatment for disease, and not those suffering from wounds. TABLE V.

It will be observed the Atlantic region has a rate slightly higher than the Central, but that in both the rate is about 10 per cent, of the strength. The rate for the Pacific region, 7 per cent., is in striking contrast with the slight mortality of that region. COMPARATIVE FREQUENCY OF THE SEVERAL DISEASES. The monthly sick reports of the several regiments, detachments, and garrisons give the number taken sick during the month, and the number of deaths from each of the more important diseases; the reports of the general hospitals give the number of ad- missions and deaths from each disease. The form employed during the first year of the war differed in arrangement and in some other points from the improved form adopted in the summer of 1862. Among the changes may here especially be mentioned a change in classification and the omission of the designation unclassified—(morbi varii)—the diseases not embraced in the list being directed to be reported as "other diseases," under the

XV REPORT ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA. The ratio of deaths to cases was as follows: For cholera, 403.7 deaths per 1,000 cases, or one death to 2.5 cases amon<,^ white troops; among colored troops, 522.4 deaths per 1,000 cases, or oue death to 1.9 cases; so that somewhat less than half the white, and somewhat more than half the colored soldiers attacked with cholera died. For diarrhoeal diseases the mortality was small, 10.1 deaths per 1,000 cases for white, and 6.1 per 1,000 for colored troops. For all other diseases the mortality was 11.7 per 1,000 cases for white, and 13.6 per 1,000 for colored troops. As to the duration of the disease in fatal cases, there are reports from Camp Grant, Eichmond, Virginia; Tybee Island, Georgia; and Little Rock, Arkansas. It would appear from these reports that the great majority of pa- tients die on the first or second day of the disease. The greatest duration of any fatal case being to the fifteenth day.

As to the question of quarantine the facts are not perhaps conclusive, yet they are too numerous and too important to be overlooked, and although certain breaks in the chain of evidence exist, there can be doubt as to the general facts of the case. The epidemic appears from the record to have radiated distinctly from two chief centres. Originating in the overcrowded barracks of Governor's island, New York Harbor, in the immediate vicinity of an infected city, through which recruits

133 CERTAIN OTHER DISEASES. tensive and comparatively thinly-populated country will account for this difference in our favor; but the published statistics of the United States army from 1840 to 1859 give a mean annual rate of only 99 cases of venereal per 1000 of mean strength during that period; and this, though larger than the rates above given for the first two years of the war, is less than one-third of the most favorable rate above quoted from the English statistics. When the frequency of venereal among the troops of the three regions is made the subject of comparison, it is found that in the Atlantic region the rate was 87 cases per 1000 of strength for the first year, 61 for the second; in the Central region, 60 per 1000 for the first year, 63 for tlie second; in the Pacific region rates are, however, attained which closely approximate those of the English army, viz.: 375 per 1000 for the first year and 317 for the second.

But even during that period it was about twice as great as in the rest of the army. Among the documents connected with syphilis which have been received for pubr lication, may be mentioned certain interesting papers with regard to the attempts made by the military authorities in the Cities of Nashville and Memphis to limit the spread of syphilis among the troops stationed near those places, by regulating prostitu- tion after the plan practised by the French government in Paris—a plan which is re- ported to have produced the most salutary results in both places. Under the head of Dietic Diseases, the chief affections included are scurvy and the abuse of alcohol. As to the latter of these causes of disease, the activity of the cam- paigns, and the stringent regulations very generally enforced with regard to sutlers, reduced the frequency of intoxication to a comparatively low figure in the large armies of the Atlantic and Central regions. During the first year, 656 cases of delirium tremens and 978 cases of drunkenness (ebrietas) are reported—drunkenness here including only those cases in which, in con- sequence of the debauch, the man was obliged to go on sick report; during the second year, 772 cases of delirium tremens, 1221 of drunkenness, and 226 of chronic alcohol-

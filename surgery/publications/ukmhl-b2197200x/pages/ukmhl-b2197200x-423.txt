This consists, besides detailed sta- tistics, of a number of papers on the subject by medical officers, of numerous histories of cases and accounts of autopsies, of pathological specimens, drawings, and microscopical preparations, and of the records of microscopical investigations in the Army Medical Museum. The subject is one of such general interest that, although it is utterly im- possible to present in this place even an outline of the material collected, it may not be amiss to make a few remarks suggested by these studies. The origin of the diarrhoea and dysentery of troops is to be sought in no one con- dition, but in the co-operation of several, each of which should be the subject of hygienic precautions, if the health of an army is to be preserved. Some of the chief of these, but assuredly not the only ones, are the scorbutic taint dependent upon camp diet, the mala- rial influences operating in certain seasons and regions, the overcrowding and filth of camps and barracks, the heat of summer, the exhaustion and fatigue of campaigns, and the use of water containing saline or organic impurities. Whether there has ever existed, in addition to these intelligible conditions, any specific causative momentum deserving the designation of epidemic influence, is a grave question which receives no affirmative reply from any experience reported during this war. The causation of chronic diarrhoea and dysentery is to be found in the long-continued action of the influences above men- tioned, and in the consequent frequency and duration of attacks, but not in any specific cause or set of causes different from those which induce the acute form. The influence of the scorbutic taint in the production of diarrhoea and dysentery is shown not only by the increased frequency of these disorders whenever supplies of fresh meat and vegetables have been deficient, but also by the presence of readily- recognized scorbutic symptoms in the patients. When, on marches or active campaigns, the diet is reduced to a minimum, often consisting chiefly of hard bread and coffee, with but a scanty supply of salt pork, and of beef on the hoof, the number of acute attacks of a mild form, as also of attacks which become chronic, is always greatly increased. It would be a grave error, however, to suppose, as has been done for example by Dr. J. H. Salisbury, of Ohio,* that this is the efficient cause of the disorder, and to reject the consideration of other momenta.

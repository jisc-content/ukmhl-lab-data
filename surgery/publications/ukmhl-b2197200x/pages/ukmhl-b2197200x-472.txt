158 HOSPITAL ORGANIZATION AND CONSTRUCTION. ventilation; hence I selected some of tliera as gangrene wards, and, I think, with the very best results. In winter, each ward was heated by two stoves, with pipes running to a shaft in the centre. Each ward of four tents contained 20 beds. The length of the fence around the hospital is 1458 yards. The distance of the fence from the tents at the base of the triangle is 124 feet. Sinks were arranged around the whole line of fence. They had movable boxes, which were regularly emptied and limed. Policing was done by a gang of about 20 freedmen. The hospital could accom- modate 1240 patients in the 20 barrack wards. Its total capacity in January, 1865, was 2575 beds, including those in tents and the branch barracks, a short distance off. This hospital was opened December 23d, 1862, and closed August 22d, 1865. During this period the movements of patients were as follows: I j White Troops Colored Troops .., Prisoners of War. Total Deducting those sent to general hospital as cases not terminated, and considering that furloughed and deserted amounted to 4686, while only 3565 of these are reported as returned from furlough and desertion, we shall have the following statistics for the terminated cases of white trooj)S treated: Total to be accounted for, excluding those sent to other hospitals. Returned to duty Mustered out of service at the close of the war Loss by desertion and failure to return from furlough Discharged for disability Transferred to Veteran Reserve Corps Died These figures represent excellent results, but they are not more favorable than the general statistics of all the hospitals. Making proper corrections for transfers from hospital to hospital, there were over a million of patients treated in the general hos- pitals during the four years of the war, and the mortality, including both that from disease and that from wounds, was but one death to every twelve patients, or about 8 per cent. Harewood Hospital, Washington, D. C, was constructed on a plan quite similar to that of Lincoln Hospital. The Hampton General Hospital, near Fortress Monroe, was also composed of wards arranged en echelon in the form of a V, but not overlapping Admitted. rlough Results. Wounded. Total.

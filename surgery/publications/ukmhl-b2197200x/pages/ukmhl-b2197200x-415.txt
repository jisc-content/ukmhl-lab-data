115 INTERMITTENT FEVER. Intermittent fever was more frequent during the second year than the first. In both, however, the total number of cases during the year amounted to considerably more than one-fourth of the strength. The mortality for the first year was a little over one per 1000 of strength, for the second a little over two per 1000. TABLE XIX.

In the Pacific region, there were no deaths during the first year and but one during the second. In the Atlantic region, the deaths were somewhat over one per 1000 of strength the first year, somewhat less than one per 1000 during the second; while in the Central region, the deaths were somewhat over two per 1000 during the first year, somewhat over three per 1000 during the second. These relations are exhibited in detail in Table XX. TABLE XX. Number of Cases and Deaths from Intermittent Fever in each of the three regions. Yeah eitoinci June 30, 1862. Yeab endino June 30, 1863.

In the Pacific region, for the two years, the proportion was over two thousand cases to each death.

Brevet Lt. Col. J. J. Woodward, Assistant Surgeon, U. S. A: Fort Harker, Kansas, July 31, 1867. General : I have the honor to forwai'd the following report in reference to the pievalence of epidemic cholera at this post: On the evening of the 22d of Jul}' I arrived at Fort Harker, Kansas, accompanied by the Medical Director, Surgeon E. Swift, and Acting Assistant Surgeons W. H. Renick and A. W. Wiggins, U. S. A. Cases of epidemic cholera ^v;ere occurring daily at that time, and the disease had existed with a certain degree of regularity since the 27th of June, the date of the occurrence of the first case at the post. I was at once assigned to duty, relieving Brevet Major G. M. Sternberg, Assistant Surgeon, U. S. A. He had recently met with a severe loss in the death of his wife, at the post, of cholera, and was unfitted for duty from physical and mental prostration. His assistant, Acting Assistant Surgeon T. B. Chase, U. S. A., had lost his wife but an hour previous to my arrival, from puer- peral convulsions. I immediately went on duty and visited the cholera wards, in company with the Medical Director and Dr. Swift. Measui-es> such as the most recent investigations warranted, assisted by the advice and experience of the senior medical officers present, were immediately put in force. I took personal charge of the cholera wards. The most recent and approved methods of treatment were adopted, and every known means resorted to for the cure or alleviation of the disease. I regret to say that the result of any treatment after the disease was fully established was liighly unsatisfactory. A large majority of the cases were not seen until the stage of collapse had ensued; and to this I a*tribute, in part, the large mortality. The following tables show the number of cases, also the number of deaths, from the commencement of the epidemic until its disappearance: Table showing the number of cases and deaths from.

INTRODUCTION. 6 of Fractures of the Cranium, of Fractures of the Bones of the Face, of Fractures of the Vertebrae, of Scalp Wounds, of Flesh Wounds of the Face, and of Flesh Wounds of the Neck. Especial attention was given to collecting all the information on file in the office in relation to gunshot wounds of the three great cavities, gunshot fractures of the femur, and the less common surgical operations. The histories of several thousand specimens at the Army Medical Museum, that had been forwarded prior to the adop- tion of the new system of reports, were tabulated upon the proper forms and tran- scribed upon the records; and, on the other hand, the records were found to furnish histories for many later specimens that had been forwarded without memoranda. An endeavor was made to co-ordinate and harmonize these data. The following classification of wounds and their results and of operations was finally adopted. It is less elaborate than that employed in the British statistics of the surgery in the Crimea, and more detailed than that followed by M. Chenu, in the French sur- gical report of the Crimean war. The appended figures give the number of cases of each class that were revised and corrected upon the new registers on September 30th, 1865.

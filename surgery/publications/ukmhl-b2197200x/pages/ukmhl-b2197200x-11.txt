REPORT ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA iW YELLOW FEVER m THE ARMY OF THE UNITED STATES, DURING THE YEAR 1867. By Brevet liieut. Col. J. J. Woodward, Assistant Surgeon, U. 8. A. Surgeon General's Office, MaT/ 5, 1868. General: In accordance with your instructions, I have prepared an account of the prevalence of cholera and yellow fever in the army during the year 1867, which I herewith respectfully submit: I.â€”EPIDEMIC CHOLERA. In view of the possible appearance of cholera during the approaching summer, the Surgeon General issued a circular on the 20th of April, 1867, which gave instructions as" to precautionary measures, and directed that in case the pestilence should appear among the troops at any post, a special report should be made, giving a statement of the facts, and transmitting the names of all officers and soldiers attacked, together with the nativity, age, rank, regiment, company, length of service, date of attack, and date of recovery or of death, in each case. (See Circular No. 3, Appendix, p. 17.) These reports were made with commendable diligence by the medical officers brought in contact with cholera during the year, and from these, mainly, the following sketch of the epidemic has been prepared. In compiling the statistical tables appended, (Appendix I, pp. 1-15,) the figures con- tained in the monthly reports of sick and wounded have been carefully compared with the lists of names, and all discrepancies inquired into and corrected. It is therefore believed that the figures are worthy of all confidence. These tables show the monthly mean strength at each station mentioned, and the monthly number of cases and deaths of cholera, cholera morbus, acute diarrhoea, chronic diarrhoea, acute dysentery, and chronic dysentery, are presented separately ; the tables also give a monthly total for these diarrhoeal diseases, a total for all other diseases, and an aggregate.

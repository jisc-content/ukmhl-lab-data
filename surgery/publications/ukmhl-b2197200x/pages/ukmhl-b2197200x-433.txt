A reference to Table XXX. will show that by far the greatest number of deaths from the inflammatory affections of the respiratory organs were reported under the head of Pneumonia. Out of a total of 8090 deaths from respiratory affections, 7091 are reported as due to this cause. It might perhaps be claimed that this mortality is too great, on account of a certain number of cases of fatal pleurisy and bronchitis having been erroneously included. But the same deficient knowledge of auscultation and per- cussion which would lead to this error, would produce also an error in the opposite direction, and cause the slight cases of pneumonia to be reported as bronchitis. While then it is possible that the ratio of deaths from pneumonia to strength is somewhat too great, the probabilities are in favor of the approximative correctness of the proportion of deaths to cases; and this proportion is so great, as compared with the results in modern civil hospitals, as to direct attention to the general want of success which ap- pears to have attended the treatment of this disorder. The experience of the two years gives a mortality of one death to every seven (6'8) cases in the Atlantic region and one to every four (3*8) in the Central, as is shown in the following table: TABLE XXXYI.

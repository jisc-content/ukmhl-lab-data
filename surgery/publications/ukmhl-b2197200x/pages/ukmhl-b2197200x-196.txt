EXIEACTS FROM OFFICIAL REPORTS. 154 1st. The prevalence of yellow fever in the West Indies, at Key West, and at numerous points along the Gulf coast. 2d. The arrival in May and June of about one hundred unacclimated recruits. 3d. An unusual fall of rain during the months of June, July, and August, amounting to 37.20 inchesâ€”within about two inches of the average fall for a whole year. 4th. A remarkably persistent wind from the southeast, commencing about the 20th of May and continuing, almost without intermission, until the 1st of September. This direction of the wind is very exceptional, its course being generally from the northeast. 5th. The moat along two faces of the fort was in an unfinished condition, and had filled in to such an extent that the bottom was exposed at low tide. The stench at such times is represented as being very decided. 6th. The connection of many of the privies with t'le sewers had become interrupted, and a great amount of filth had conse- quently accumulated in the vaults. Immediately preceding the outbreak of the fever an attempt was made to clean out these places, which attempt, however, was abandoned, as the resulting eflluvia was so overpowering that the further prosecution of the work during the hot weather was deemed hazardous. On the 19th of August the first case of yellow fever occurred. The patient was a member of Company " K," 5th U. S. Artillery, then quartered in casemates on the south side of the fort, overlooking the unfinished portion of the moat previously referred to. On the 20th the second case occurred, also from Company "K," while quartered in the same locality. The- next three eases were also from this company. On the 23th the schooner Matchless arrived from Tampa, having on board a case of yellow fever. This was the sixth case. The patients had all been removed to the hospital on the east side of the fort, in the immediate vicinity of which Company "L" was quartered. On the 23d Company " K" was removed into casemates on the east side of the fort, adjoining Company " L.'' On the 2.jth the disease broke out in the latter company. It next appeared among' the servants in the olTicers' quarters. Company ' I," quartered in the baj-racks adjoining the hospital, was then attacked. Company "M," on the north side of the fort, escaped for nearly three weeks, v/hen, on the 7th of September, thirty-five cases occurred in the company. On the 4tli of Septen>ber Company "L" was removed to Bird Key, three-quarters of a mile from the fort. After the removal none were attacked except those whose duties called them to the post. On the Ist of September a hospital was established on Sand Key, two miles from the fort. A small building capable of accommodating about ten patients was already on the island, having been erected some years before as a small-pox hospital. Three hospital tents were added. Twenty-six patients were treated at this place, all of whom had taken the fever before they were sent from the fort; seven died. On the 5th of September Bi-evet Major J. Sim. Smith, Assistant Surgeon, U. S. A., the medical officer of the post, was taken rtick. He died on the 8th. During his illness, Dr. Mudd, a prisoner, was placed in charge of the hospital by the commanding officer, and rendered faithful and efficient service until the arrival of Dr. Whitehurst from Key West, September 7th. On the tiih of September Company "K" was removed to Loggerhead Key and encamped. On the 21st Company "L" was, for greater convenience, transferred to the same place from Bird Key. But one case occurred at Loggerhead, while the disease continued to rage with unabated severity at the fort. This encampment was continued until the close of the epidemic. The supply of provisions and water was derived from the post. The disease reached its height about the 20th of September, and gradually declined until the last of October, the last case occurring on the 14th of November. The total number of cases of officers, soldiers, citizens, and prisoners amounted to 270. The number of deaths was 38. The mortality among the recruits coming from the north, who had been here but a few months previous to the outbreak of the fever, was in every instance very much greater than among those who had spent a winter here. Of the 54 prisoners at the post, 44 had been here upwards of a year. Of these one died, or 3.33 per cent. Of the other ten prisoners who had been here but a few months, one died, making ten per cent. Of the men detailed as cooks and nurses in the hospital, not one escaped the disease; four died.

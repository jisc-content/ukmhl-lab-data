MORTALITY RATES. 95 have been the extent of territory over which the operations extended and the conse- quent embarrassment in the transportation of supplies; in addition, it is to be noted that the malarial miasms, under the influence of which intermittent and other malarial fevers are developed, have for many years been known, from the experience of civil life, to be much more intense in the Central region than on the Atlantic slope. As might be ex- pected, therefore, we find the rates of disease and mortality very different in these three regions. Differences also exist between the different parts of each region, which, how- ever, cannot be gone into in a brief paper like the present. A comparison of the reports from the troops and hospitals in the three great regions shows the mortality rate of the Central region to be the greatest, and that of the Pacific region the least. In the Pacific region, the mortality from disease alone was about 12 per 1000 of mean strength for the first year and 8 for the second, the average for the two years closely corresponding with the rates for young men of military ages in civil life, and with the mortality of the British troops in Great Britain and Ireland, as given in their official reports for 1859, '60, '61, and '62. In the Atlantic region, the rates were nearly 33 for the first year and 41 for the second. In the Central region, 80 for the first year and nearly 90 for the second. Tables I. and II. present the monthly mortality in each of these regions.

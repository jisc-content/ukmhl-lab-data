114 INTERMITTENT FEVER. INTERMITTENT FEVER. The several forms of intermittent fever played a conspicuous part among the dis- eases of the army, as might indeed have been anticipated, from a consideration of the frequency of these affections in the United States. They were not the source of any very great mortality; nevertheless the malarial influence, of which the frequency of these simple manifestations may be regarded as the measure, played a part in so many more serious and more fatal affections, that the rate of the occurrence of intermittents assumes a high significance in the appreciation of the comparative mortality of the several regions. Intermittent fevers were reported under the several heads of Quotidian, Tertian, Quartan, and Congestive. The total number of all forms reported was 72,810 during the first year, 189,997 during the second; making a total during the two years of 262,807 cases reported. The mortality, however, was extremely small, with the ex- ception of the so-called congestive formâ€”(the Pernicious Fever of Dr. Wood). The whole number of deaths, including this more fatal variety, was 430 during the first year and 1358 during the second, or 1788 during the two years. Excluding the conges- tive cases, the mortality of the other varieties was but 407 deaths for the two years, or one death to every 631 cases. It has not, however, been thought proper to omit these cases, as, after all, in the present state of our knowledge they are to be regarded simply as extremely intense cases of intermittent fever, and are therefore a proper element to be included in considering the mortality of this affection. Embracing them in the computation, it will be found that there was one death to every 147 cases during the two years. It may be remarked, however, that possibly a certain number of cases of spotted fever and of cerebro-spinal meningitis may have been erroneously included under the head of Congestive Fever. The following table shows the number of cases and deaths reported from each variety of intermittent fever. It will be seen that, according to the reports. Quotidian was somewhat the most frequent form, next comes the Tertian: the Quartan is com- paratively rare, the Congestive still rarer. TABLE XVIII.

AMPUTATIONS. 45 AMPUTATIONS. The histories of 13,397 amputations for gunshot injury have been examined and recorded, and the final results have been ascertained in 9705 cases. The following table exhibits the number belonging to each region, and includes both primary and secondary cases. It shows the regular increase in the rate of mortality as the trunk is approached. Amputations of the Superior Extremities, Fingers and Parts of the Hand Wrist Elbow Forearm Arm Shoulder-Joint Total of Upper Extremity Amputations of the Inferior Extremities.

In the 1807 terminated cases, the mortality has been compara- tively large. The causes of death in the 29 fatal cases are stated to have been: in 4, pyaemia; in 4, erysipelas; in 2, gangrene; in 1, tetanus; in 18, different intercurrent diseases, as typhoid and malarial fevers, pleurisy, etc. Amputations at the Wrist.—The disarticulation at the wrist has been performed in preference to the amputation of the forearm, when the hand was totally disorganized. "When practised by the circular method it is a good operation. The results of the cases examined are satisfactory, the mortality being ten per cent, less than in amputation of the forearm. Amputations of the Forearm.—Except in those cases in which the wrist or lower extremity of the radius have been shattered by large projectiles, this amputation has commonly been practised secondarily. It has been impracticable to examine all the cases that have been reported. Of the terminated cases that have been transcribed upon the records, 99 died and 500 recovered. Of the latter, 397 have been supplied

XXVI REPORT ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA AND YELLOW FEVER. T. Artaud says of the fatal case, that tlie patient was brought from Madison, Florida, but he states that yellow fever was not existing eitlier at Madison or at Tallahassee. The foregoing summary statement exhibits the chief facts of the epidemic so far as known. For details the reader is referred to the documents presented in the Appendix. A numerical summary of these facts shows that there were 1,349 cases and 428 deaths of white, 171 cases and 25 deaths of colored troops, including the cases in June; the mor- tality being 317 deaths per thousand cases, or one death to every 3.15 cases for the white, 146 deaths per thousand cases, or one death to every 6.84 cases for the colored troops- The mortality for the whole number, including both white and colored, was 298 per thousand, or one death to every 3.36 cases. It will be observed, on comparing the ratios above given, that the number of cases and the ratio of deaths to cases among the colored troops is considerably smaller than among the white. Since, however, the whole number of colored troops exposed was much smaller than that of the white, the comparison will be most fairly made if we take the figures for New Orleans, (see Tables 11 and 12, pp. 74-75,) where white and colored appear to have been exposed. Here it will be clearly seen that the projjortion of cases and deaths to strength, and also of deaths to cases, is much greater among the white troops. Of these there were 866 cases and 256 deaths per thousand average mean strength for the six months, while of the colored troops, for the same time, the ratio was but 521 cases and 73 deaths per thousand of strength. The relation between cases and deatlis was as follows: For white troops, 296 deaths per thousand cases, or one death to every 3.38 cases; for colored troops, 141 deaths per thousand cases, or one death to every 7 cases. The weekly progress of the epidemic is well shown in the following tables for Gal- veston, Houston, New Orleans, and Fort Jefferson, which are the places where the largest number of cases occurred : I.

REPORT ON EPIDEMIC CHOLERA. XI The first case among the white troops at Memphis, Tennessee, occurred September 6th, and died the next day. The patient was a recruit who had arrived the day before the attack, from Nashville. Altogether, there were 21 cases and 16 deaths during September among the white troops at Memphis. On the 15th of August, however, a fatal case had occurred in the post hospital at Memphis. The patient was a soldier of the fifty-sixth United States colored troops, who was taken from on board the steamer Continental passing up the river from Helena, Arkansas. The first case among the white troops at Vicksburg, Mississippi, occurred on the 22nd of August, on which day two soldiers were attacked. The colored barber had died of the disease the day before.

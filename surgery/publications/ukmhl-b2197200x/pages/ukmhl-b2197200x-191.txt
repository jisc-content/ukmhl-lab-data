The immunity from the prevailing epidemic enjoyed by the military at Forts Pickens and Barrancas, under the command of General Seymour, forms a notable point in medical history. From a memorandum kindly furnished by General Seymour, it appears that Barrancas, situated some three-fourths of a mile west of the navy yard, is built on a ridge of sand some twenty-five feet above tide-water, and is backed by a plain of sand at that elevation. In front is a strip of low ground only two or three feet above tide-water, vei-y damp, wet, and even swampy. Those who have inhabited this low ground in summer have almost invariably been attacked with intermittent fever. The barrack is built some fifty feet above the plain; it is a three-story brick building, and the company occupies the upper story. Between Barrancas and Warrington is a dense belt of woods, about one-fourth of a mile tlirough; on all the other sides, Barran?as is quite open for long distances. The fever extended in Warrington quite to this belt of woods, several cases having been reported in the houses nearest the woods.

EXTRACTS FROM OFFICIAL REPORTS. 54 All these cases were brought to hospital in obedience to orders to send cases there as soon as they occurred, and, within a few hours; they, therefore, doubtless represent accurately the duration of the disease. The few hours' variation would occur in- cases taken in the nig^ht, and not sent from camp to hospital, distant two to four miles, until morning. Two of these were cases of relapse. In one of these, during supposed convalesence, the relapse occurred on the thirteenth day, the patient dying on the fifteenth. In the other, convalescence being apparently established, relapse occurred on the fifth day, and the patient died on the seventh. Of the cases which recovered, a fraction were transferred from the cholera to a convalescent ward as soon as supposed out of danger. In these cases, transfer was made as follows: On second day 1 On third day 2 On fourth day 2 On fifth day 2 On sixth day 4 The remaining fortj'-seven cases were returned to duty as follows On seventh day 2 On eighth day 1 On ninth day 3 Total 17 On fourth day 2 On fifth day 2 On sixth day 4 On seventh day 2 On eighth day 1 On tenth day , 3 On eleventh day ] On twelfth day 3 Ou thirteenth day 3 On fifteenth day 2 On seventeenth day 1 On nineteenth day 2 Ou twentieth day 2 Of the seventeen cases reported above as transferred, the day of return to duty is given in six cases, as follows: On twenty-first day 2 On twenty-second day 3 On twenty-third day 1 On twenty-fourth day 2 On twenty-fifth day 2 On twenty-seventh day 2 On twenty-ninth day 2 On thirtieth day 2 On thirty-first day ] On thirty-ninth day 1 No dates given 1 Total. 47 On twenty-sixth day 2 Ou twenty-ninth day 1 On fifth day 1 On twenty-third day ' 1 On twenty-fifth day - 1 The cases reported as returned to duty so soon after they were attacked, viz., the fourth and fifth days, are described by Acting Assistant Surgeon Denell as presenting the symptoms of cholera before the stage of collapse—rice-water evacuations, vomiting, cramps, &c. Eegarded as an epidemic, the cholera, as observed in the hospital, may be said to have begun September 1.'), and ended September 28. Cases, however, were received in the hospital September 30, October 9, and October 17, one each day; and all three died. In one of the September cases no dates whatever are given ; and in one it is only stated that the duration of the disease was ten days. The last two mentioned cases recovered. The remaining one hundred and twenty-four cases were received into hospital as follows : . received. No. died. No. recovered. 4 3 1 10 5 5 9 1 8 5 3 2 5 3 2 19 10 9 25 10 15 21 14 7 8 5 3 7 3 4 1 1 5 2 3 3 1 2 2 1 1 Date of admission.

The following meteorological observations were taken by myself, and relate to the period when the epidemic was at its height. The thermometer observed hung on a covered porch, with a northern exposure : Srptemhcr 14.—Sunshiny, damp; thermometer at 7 a. m., 75°; sultry and hot; winds southerly; clouds flying, with much thunder and lightning. Scpteinbcr 15.—7 a. m., cloudy, raw, and damp, wind from southeast; dry bulb, G9^; wet bulb, 5(5°; 2 p. m., dry bulb, 85° ; wet bulb, 73°; no wind, sky clear in centre, thunder and lightning, and clouds near horizon in all directions.

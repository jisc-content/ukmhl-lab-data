Besides the cases included in the foregoing tables there were also during October six oases and four deaths of colored soldiers at Galveston, Texas, which were not reported at the date of publication. It also appears from a letter of Brevet Major J. F. Weeds, Assistant Surgeon, tJ. S. Army, datÂ«d May 20, 1867, and just received, that the case of cholera at Albuquerque, New Mexico, in October was erroneously reported among white troops. The patient was a New Mexican woman, and her disease appears, from Dr. Weeds' account, to have been sporadic cholera, induced by excesses in diet indulged in while laboring under diarrhoea.

DIARRHOEA AND DYSENTERY. 119 The greatly increased mortality during the second year will be at once understood if the acute cases of diarrhoea and dysentery, as given in Table XXIV., are added together for each year and their mortality compared with that of the chronic cases. Of acute diarrhoea and dysentery, 196,788 cases and 574 deaths were reported during the first year, 438,631 cases and 1792 deaths during the second; the mortality being one death to every 331 cases in the first year and one to every 245 in the second. It appears, therefore, that the acute forms remained comparatively mild. Of chronic diarrhoea and dysentery, there were 18,426 cases and 620 deaths during the first year, 71,830 cases and 8574 deaths during the second; the mortality increasing, therefore, from one death in every 30 cases for the first year to one in every 8 for the second. This increased mortality, which shows that the chronic forms assumed a more for- midable type during the second year, becomes at once intelligible on the presumption that a certain length of time is required before the influences to which a soldier is exposed culminate in chronic diarrhoea. Indeed, individual experience shows that the same soldier has frequently, perhaps usually, repeated attacks of acute diarrhoea, which terminate in temporary recovery, and which, of course, are each reported as a separate case, before the more serious and continuous disorder sets in, on which the term "chronic" is usually bestowed. Like camp fever and intermittents, diarrhoea and dysentery were most frequent in the Central region; less so in the Atlantic, and least in the Pacific region. In the Central region, the cases were more numerous than the strength during the first year and nearly equal to the strength during the second; in the Atlantic, they were more than half the strength during the first year and more than three-quarters during the second; in the Pacific region, during each year somewhat over one-quarter the strength. The difierences between the ratio of mortality to strength in the three re- gions was still more striking: in the Central region, the mortality was 9 per 1000 of mean strength during the first year, 23 per 1000 during the second; in the At- lantic, 1 per 1000 during the first year, 9 per 1000 during the second; in the Pacific region, less than 1 per 1000 during each year.

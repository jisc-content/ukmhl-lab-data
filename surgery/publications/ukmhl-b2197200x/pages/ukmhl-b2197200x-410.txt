CAMP FEVER. 112 A comparison of the monthly ratios of cases to strength in each region indicates the autumnal character of many of these fevers, and confirms the idea of a malarial element in their causation, as already indicated. In fact, the season wave for camp fever during the first year of the war is similar in many respects to that of the inter- mittent fevers, the malarial origin of which is universally admitted. During the second year, the season wave, which in other respects is similar, is somewhat masked by the large figures for July and August in the Atlantic and Central regions. How far this deviation is due to the character of the campaigns of the great armies in these re- gions and the location in which they operated, is a question the discussion of which must be postponed for the present. Tables XVI. and XYII. give the monthly ratio of cases to strength in each of the three regions for the first and second years of the war. TABLE XVI.

Materials for an elaborate discussion of the subject of camp fever have been col- lected, and a careful investigation of its pathological anatomy has been conducted under my direction at the Army Medical Museum. The space to which it has been thought best to limit this paper does not, however, permit the presentation of further

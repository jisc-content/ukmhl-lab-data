The following tables show the number of discharges from the several classes, orders, and individual diseases and injuries. They may be instructively compared with Tables VI. VIII. and X., the last columns of which give the total taken sick and died for the same year. In making the comparison it must be remembered that the column "taken sick" in the tables referred to does not include secondary affections or sequelae. TABLE XXXIX.

CAMP FEVER. Ill In the Central region, the ratio of both cases and deaths was much greater during the first year than the second. During the first, the cases amounted to nearly one-third the strength; the deaths to about thirty-two per 1000 of strength. During the second year, the cases were somewhat less than one-fourth the strength; the deaths twenty- four per 1000 of strength. In the Pacific region, the cases for each year amounted only to between seventy and eighty per 1000 of strength; the deaths somewhat over one per 1000 during the first year, somewhat less than one per 1000 during the second. These relations are here presented in detail. TABLE XIY. Number of Cases and Deaths from Gamp Fever in each of the three regions. Year ending June 30,1862. Tear ending June 30,1863. Taken sick. Died.

It is then seen that the disease is not only more frequent, but more fatal in proportion to the number of cases, in the Central region than in the Atlantic, and in this more than in the Pacific. In the Central region there was one death to every 9*7 cases for the first year; one for every 9*3 for the second. In the Atlantic region one to 14 cases for the first year; one to 12 for the second. In the Pacific region, as there were but eleven deaths in the first year and six in the second, much importance cannot be attached to its ratios. The relationship of deaths to cases for each year and region is shown in the following table: TABLE XV. Relation between Cases and Deaths of Camp Fever. Year ending June 30,1862.

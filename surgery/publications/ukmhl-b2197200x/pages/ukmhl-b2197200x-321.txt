31 GUNSHOT "WOUNDS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITIES. Gunshot wounds of the knee-joint, with or without fracture of the patella, or of the epiphyses of the femur or tibia, have been recorded in like manner, to the number, thus far, of 1183. , Of the 1823 cases of gunshot fracture of the femur that have been entered on the permanent records, the results have been ascertained in 1233. Of the 1183 cases of gunshot wounds of the knee-joint, the results are known in 740, While it is deemed premature to discuss these results when it may be reasonably hoped that the completed statistics will definitely settle the important questions that are here involved, it is yet thought expedient to report them, chiefly that the magni- tude of the subject may be put in evidence, and that the absolute necessity for long and patient investigation may be acknowledged. The following table exhibits at a glance the results of 2003 cases of gunshot fracture of the femur, or of gunshot wounds of the knee-joint, out of a total of 3106 cases hitherto recorded. The fractures of the femur are separated according to regions. The left hand column gives the number of cases belonging to each region of which the ultimate results have been satisfactorily determined. The right hand column gives the total number of cases of injuries of each region that have been recorded. The inter- mediate columns give the comparative results of treatment by amputation, excision, or attempt at conservation of the limb, the number of recoveries and deaths and unfinished cases in each category being mentioned, and the rate of mortality calculated for the finished cases alone.

It will be seen that intermittents occur at all seasons of the year, but that they are most frequent in the latter portion of the summer, and during the autumn months. In the Atlantic region, the maximum was attained in September during the first year, in October during the second; in the Central region, in August and October during the first year, October during the second; in the Pacific region, in August during the first year and September during the second. The curve formed by the monthly ratios in each region is an autumnal one, and, on the whole, September and October would appear to be the months of greatest fre- quency. To appreciate fully, however, the effects of season, it would be necessary to study the detailed statistics of the several armies in each region, with their location and exposures, which is out of the question in a brief pamphlet. Full materials for such a comparison are in course of compilation. The lower diagram of the plate facing page 112 represents these fluctuations, and may be advantageously compared with the diagram showing the monthly rates of camp fever, which occupies the upper part of the same plate and is constructed on the same scale.

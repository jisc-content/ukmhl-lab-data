164 HOSPITAL ORGANIZATION AND CONSTRUCTION. On comparing the statistical reports of the hospitals in various parts of the country, we are struck by the fact that the number returned to duty and the ratio of deaths to terminated cases were greater in those hospitals which were nearest the seat of war. On the other hand, the number discharged the service for disability and transferred to the Veteran Reserve Corps was greater in the more distant ones. These facts, which naturally result from the reception of acute cases into the nearest hospitals and the frequent transfers thence to the more distant ones, must be remembered in all comparisons made between the results of treatment in different institutions. To give an idea of the vast extent of hospital accommodations demanded, the following list of general hospitals in existence in September, 1864, is here presented. The hospital system had at that time attained its maximum extent, there being 202 general hospitals and 136,894 beds for patients. The number of beds was gradually reduced till January, 1865, when there were 121,000, and about this number was kept on foot to the close of the war.

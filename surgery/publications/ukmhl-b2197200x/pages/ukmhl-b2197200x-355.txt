EXCISIONS. 61 Excisions of the Head of the Femur.—In 1861, our information in regard to excisions of the head of the femur for gunshot injury was summed up by Dr. Hodges in his excellent monograph,* and in 1863, by M. Legouestf and M. Boeckel.J Dr. Hodges quotes the observations of Oppenheim, Seutin, Schwartz, and Baum, and the six cases given in the Surgical History of the British Army in the Crimea, and with more detail by Macleod. Legouest adds Textor's case, and Boeckel ascribes a case to Guthrie, which is apocryphal. Dr. Esmarch refers to another case operated on by Dr. Ross, and described in the Deutsches Klinih for 1850, No. 41.

Died in a fortnight. Gunshot fracture of the neck of the femur. Ibid., p. 344. There were then on record, previous to the late war, twelve cases of this opera- tion, with one success. This was the case reported by Surgeon O'Leary of the 68th British Infantry, who excised the head and several inches of the shaft of the femur for Private Thomas Mackenena, the great trochanter being shattered by a fragment of shell. Experience having demonstrated the uniform fatality of gunshot fractures of the head or neck of the femur when abandoned to the resources of nature, and the exces- sive mortality of amputations at the hip-joint for gunshot injury, the highest authorities in military surgery were then unanimous in advising, under suitable conditions, excision of the head of the femur, until, as Baron Hippoly te Larrey expressed it, the experiments of the future proved more discouraging than the experience of the past.§ How far this advice has been acted upon in the late war, may be seen from the following table, which exhibits also the form in which all surgical operations are recorded on the registers of this office. * The Excisions of Joints.

INTRODUCTION. 2 in regard to the operations of the Medical Department, and the succor given to the wounded; reports and dissertations on new methods and modes of treatment, and modifications of surgical apparatus and appliances; pathological researches on morbid processes pertaining to surgery, as hospital gangrene, osteomyelitis, pyaemia, and the like; plans for ambulance organization, and the transportation of the wounded by land and water. The extent of these materials is simply enormous. The returns are of as huge proportions as the armies that have been engaged in active operations for the last four years. The great body of the medical officers have made the reports required of them with commendable diligence and promptitude, and their zeal is the more deserving of praise when the engrossing nature of their field duties is considered. The result has been the accumulation of a mass of facts and observations in military surgery of unprecedented magnitude. It is as yet impracticable to determine with accuracy the number of wounds received in action during the late war, though data for a near approximative estimate are accessible. But a comparison of a portion of the returns with the complete statistics of other armies will sufficiently indicate the vast numbers that are dealt with. In the British Army in the Crimea, during the entire war there were 12,094 wounded and 2755 killed, or a total of 14,849.* In the French Army in the Crimea, of a total effective force of 309,268, according to the report recently made by M. Chenu, there were 39,868 wounded and 8250 killed, or a total of 48,118, although in his report of injuries of different regions M. Chenu records but 26,681 cases.f In the late war, the monthly reports from a little more than half the regiments in the field give, for the year ending June 30th, 1862, an aggregate of 17,496 gunshot wounds. The reports from rather more than three-fourths of the regiments, for the year ending June 30th, 1863, give a total of 55,974 gunshot wounds. The battle-field lists of wounded for the years 1864-65 include over 114,000 names. But these returns are to he completed by collating with them the reports of general hospitals, where many wounded were received whose names the recorders of field hospitals or regi- mental medical officers failed to obtain, and by adding the names of those killed in battle. In comparing tlie numbers of cases of some important injury, as, for example, gunshot fractures of the femur, it is found that in the French Crimean Army there were 459 such injuries, and in the English Army 194, while over 5000 such cases have been reported to this office. Or if one of the major operations is selected for comparison, as excision of the head of the humerus, the Crimean returns give 16 of these excisions in the British, and 38 in the French Army, but the registers of this office contain the detailed histories of 575 such operations. * Medical and Surgical History of the British Army which served in the Crimea, during the war against Eussia, in the years 1854, 185.5, 1856.

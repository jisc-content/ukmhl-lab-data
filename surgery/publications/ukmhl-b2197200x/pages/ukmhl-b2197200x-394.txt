90 GENERAL PREVALENCE OF DISEASE. The monthly reports from which the foregoing rates of mortality from disease were computed give also a certain amount of information as to the mortality from wounds and injuries. The deaths from these causes, reported during the first year of the war, were 4857 out of the strength given above, or seventeen (16-7) per 1000 of mean strength; during the second year, 10,142, or sixteen (15'7) per 1000. These rates, however, by no means represent the real losses from wounds and injuries, since they do not include those slain in battle, or those who died of their wounds while prisoners of war or otherwise absent. To form a correct estimate of the total losses from wounds, I must therefore refer to the Surgical History of the War. GENERAL PREVALENCE OP DISEASE. The directions for making the monthly sick reports in the armies of the United States require every man excused from duty, on account of sickness, to appear on the report. The total number taken sick represents thus slight indispositions as well as severe illness, and the figures are therefore much larger than in those armies in which such only are reported as are received into hospital. It follows that the comparative health of the several divisions of our army is to be ascertained rather by considering the monthly number taken sick with serious diseases, such as fever and diarrhoea, than by merely observing the total number of cases reported. The statistics show the ratio of cases to have been such, during the first two years of the war, that on the average each soldier must have been taken on sick report several times a year. The figures of the second year show a slight diminution in the number of cases. The ratio for the whole army was 2966 per 1000 of mean strength for the first year, 2694 for the second. In the Atlantic region, the number of cases was 2749 per 1000 of mean strength for the first year, 2563 for the second. In the Central region, 3422 for the first year, 2832 for the second. In the Pacific re- gion, 2168 for the first year, 2123 for the second. Tables III. and lY. give the monthly rates for each of these regions. TABLE III.

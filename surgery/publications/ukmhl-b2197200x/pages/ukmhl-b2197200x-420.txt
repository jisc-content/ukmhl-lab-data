In the Atlantic region, the greatest monthly ratio was during July, 1861, after which it diminished through the fall and winter, but again increased from March to June, 1862; July, 1862, was the maximum month for the second year. The cases greatly diminished in Augustâ€”after the Army of the Potomac had withdrawn from the Peninsula to near "Washington; but increased in September, and attained a second maxi- mum in October, which is the month in which intermittents were most frequent in this region; it then diminished steadily till April, 1863, increasing again in May and June. In the Central region, the maximum month is August, 1861, after which there is a gradual diminution till December; an increase in January, 1862; a falling off in Febru- ary, and a great increase in March and April. The monthly ratio became gradually less during May, June, July, and August, but increased considerably in September, after which it gradually diminished until January, 1863, when it increased again, and made subsequently but slight fluctuations. On the Pacific coast, the disease was most frequent during the summer and autumnal months. The following tables give the rates, and the upper diagram of the plate facing this page represents them to the eye: TABLE XXVIII.

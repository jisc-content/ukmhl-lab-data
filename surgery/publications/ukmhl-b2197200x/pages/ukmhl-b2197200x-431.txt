It will thus be seen that the ratio of cases to strength during the second year is only about one-half that during the first while the ratio of deaths to strength is about the same; so that while the proportionate number of cases greatly diminished during the second year, their comparative fatality increased and the proportion of mortality to strength remained about the same. The greater prevalence of slight cases during the first year thus indicated is probably to be attributed, to a certain extent at least, to the large number of men taken suddenly, during the fall and winter, from the shelter and comforts of civil life and subjected to the exposure of camps. The greater number of cases of measles during the first year is also undoubtedly connected with the greater prevalence of catarrhal cases. Unlike camp fever and diarrhoea, the inflammatory afiections of the respiratory organs occurred with nearly equal frequency in the three regions, the only exception being in the case of the Pacific region, which suffered somewhat less than the others during the first year, somewhat more during the second. The proportion of mortality to strength, however, followed the same general law as the other important camp dis- eases, being most frequent in the Central and least so in the Pacific region. In the Central region it was 16 per 1000 of strength during the first year, 14 during the second; in the Atlantic about 4 per 1000 of strength during both years; in the Pacific about 1 per 1000 during both.

The inflammation of the gland seldom termin- ated in abscess, except in those cases which occurred as complications of camp fever. Metastasis to the testicle was not unfrequent. The disease appeared to spread bj contagion, aflfecting almost exclusively those who had never previously suffered. INFLAMMATORY DISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY ORGANS. The last of the miasmatic group of zymotic affections on which remarks will here be made is Epidemic Catarrh, of which 11,^14 cases and 5 deaths were reported during the first year, and 63,202 cases and 24 deaths during the second. Considerable confusion, however, appears to have existed as to the precise signification and limits of the terms Catarrh, Epidemic Catarrh, and Acute Bronchitis; precisely similar cases being reported by different surgeons under each of these heads. It appears probable, moreover, that the causes determining inflammatory affections of the several portions of the respi- ratory apparatus are intimately allied, the total number of cases representing the effect of exposure to unfavorable climatic influences, such as cold, dampness, etc.; while the mortality is determined partly by the intensity of the cause, partly by the hygienic surroundings and constitutional condition of the patients. Influenced by these and other reasons, it has been considered advisable to bring together into a single group all the disorders of this class. This group will be designated Inflammatory Diseases of the Respiratory Organs, and will include all the cases reported as Epidemic Catarrh, Catarrh, Acute and Chronic Bronchitis, Laryngitis, Pleurisy, and Pneumonia. The whole number of the cases of this group reported during the first year of the war was 143,991 cases and 2400 deaths; during the second year, 160,263 cases and 5690 deaths—making a total for the two years of 304,254 cases and 8090 deaths. These cases were distributed among the several affections included in the group, as shown in the following table: TABLE XXX.

Dear Doctok: [Unofficial.] Jackson Barracks, New Orleans, La., January 17, 1868. {Extract.) First. In regard to relapse.s, the report barely alludes to them. I could not get figui-es and dates with enough accuracy to warrant more than a reference to t'l^M- Second. I do not sufficiently brmg out the great importance of careful treatment during convalescence, especially in the matter of diet; the latter is a point of much importance, in view of the difficulty we have had in getting our hospital fund e.xpenditures approved at Washington. Dr. J. J. Woodward. Very truly, yours. B. A. CLEMENTS

81 MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION OF THE WOUNDED. ON MEANS OP TRANSPORTATION OF THE WOUNDED. Fig. 7C.—Regulation hand-litter. The wounded who were unable to walk were removed beyond the immediate range of musketry on hand-litters. The details for bearers were usually made from the musicians of regiments. Models of the different patterns of litters that were used are preserved at the Army Medical Museum. In the early part of the war, most of the regiments were sup- plied with stretchers of the old regulation pattern. It was found that the yoke pieces were frequently lost, and that when the canvas stretcher became damp, the litter was put together with difficulty. A light and convenient pattern, known as the "Halstead litter," was subse- quently largely used. Brigadier General Satterlee issued 12,867 of these litters from the purvey- ing depot of New York alone. They were too fragile for the hard usage to which they were subjected. Another pattern, folding up lengthwise, in which the poles were separated by folding iron braces, was very generally used during the last two years of the war. McDougall issued 5548 of these from the purveying depot in Philadelphia. Fig. 77.—Halstead folding hand-litter. Fig. 78.—Smith's hand-litter. Colonel C. Fig. 79.—Hand-litter-carriage.

A form of litter on wheels, that had been advantageously employed by the Prus- sians in the war with the Danes,* was introduced too late to test its utility practically. * Gurlt, Militar-Chirurgische Fragmente, Berlin, 1865; Neudorfer, Handbucla der Kreigs-Ohirurgie, Leipsig, 1864; and Neudorfer, Aus dem feld-iirztliclien Berichter uber die Verwundetea in Schleswig, Berlin, 1864.

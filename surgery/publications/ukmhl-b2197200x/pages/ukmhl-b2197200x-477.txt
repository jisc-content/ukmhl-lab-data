HOSPITAL ORGANIZATION AND CONSTRUCTION. 163 detailed men, barracks for guard, workshop, contagion ward, dcad-liousc, stewards' quarters, and quarters for mar- ried ofiBccrs. The buildings are plastered inside, are lighted by gas, to be warmed in the winter by stoves, and receive their water supply by pipes from the city water-works, besides which there is a tank for the purpose of keeping a stock of water constantly on hand in case of fire. For the purpose of extinguishing fire, there is abundant hose to fit the steam-pump. There are also water-buckets, axes, etc. At the distal end of each ward is a lavatory and bath- room and a water-closet. Each bath-room has in it a small stove, on which is a boiler for the supply of hot water. In the water-closets the excretions are received in troughs, into which a stream of water runs, and which are emptied by withdrawing a plug several times daily. They discharge into sewers constructed for the purpose, which carry all offensive matters entirely away from the hospital. A very beautiful model of the hospital in holly-wood has been presented to the Army Medical Museum by Surgeon Sim. This hospital was opened for patients June 9th, 1865; and the total number of white soldiers received prior to November 30th, 1865, which was the last report up to the date of writing, was 1247, of whom 984 were sick and 263 wounded. Of these, 366 were transferred to other general hospitals, and 120 remained under treatment at the date of the last report. The number of terminated cases, therefore, was 761,^who are thus accounted for: Total to be accounted for, excluding those transferred to other hospitals and those remaining at date of last report 761 Returned to duty j Mustered out of service at the close of the war | j Loss by desertion and failure to return from furlough •, Discharged for disability Transferred to Veteran Reserve Corps j Died I . . 761 131 443 52 89 2 44 761 Besides the above, 280 colored soldiers were admitted, of whom 15 died. All the hospitals hitherto described were situated near the base of military opera- tions, and received therefore more severe cases than those at a distance. As an exam- ple of the more distant hospitals, the figures of the Lovell Hospital, at Portsmouth Grove, Narraganset Bay, R. I., may here be given. This hospital, which is composed of twenty-eight fine wooden pavilion wards, situated on a tongue of land jutting out into the bay, was opened in July, 1862, and closed October 10th, 1865. During this period it received 11,696 white soldiers, of whom 8491 were sick and 3205 wounded. Of these, 2461 were transferred to other hospitals, leaving 9235 patients to be accounted for, as follows: 9235 4386 875 961 2021 716 276 9235 9235 Total to be accounted for, excluding those sent to other hospitals.

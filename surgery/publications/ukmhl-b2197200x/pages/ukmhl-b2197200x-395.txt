The average number taken on sick report annually in time of peace, from 1840 to 1859, was 2558 per 1000. CONSTANT SICKNESS RATES. In this connection, the constant sickness rates assume the highest interest, es- pecially to the military authorities. As every regimental sick report contains a sepa- rate statement of the number of sick and wounded under treatment at the close of each month, it might be supposed that the sum of these reports would furnish the number sick in the whole army at the close of each month, and that this would give a fair notion of the constant sickness. But the rates thus deduced give no idea of the number "absent sick," and the proportion of sick "absent" or "present" is not uniform, but varies continually. An army lying in winter quarters generally makes provision for most of its sick with it, while on the march all serious cases are sent to the general hospitals at the base of operations; so that constant sickness rates, which do not in- clude those absent in hospital, are of no value. Now, for the early part of the war, it has not been possible to compute reliable constant sickness rates, because very many of the reports received were the old "quarterly" form, and only show the remaining at the end of each quarter, which would hardly give a just idea of the constant rates; moreover, in these quarterly reports the "remaining" were not dis- criminated into "sick" and "wounded," but given in gross. The figures, therefore, give the constant sickness rates plus the number of wounded under treatment. Sub- sequently to the period named, however, it is possible to compile quite accurate constant sickness rates from the data of the Surgeon General's Office, by taking the number "remaining" in general hospitals into the count and carefully discriminating "sick" from "wounded." It might perhaps be hoped that the monthly and tri-monthly returns of the Adju- tant General's Office would supply the missing information for the early part of the war,

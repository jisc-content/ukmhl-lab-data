50 two of them could shut the ' window'; yet an opening could be left for air, without the rain entering, though a storm beat against them. The outer cold was kept off, and the tempera- ture could be regulated: they wanted very little attention, and the attendants had no trouble with them. No doubt the ceiling should be flat, i. e. without projecting decoration: but the angle, where the wall meets the ceiling, should not be left: the foul air will be stagnant there. A cornice can be put, without furnishing a shelf for dust. I do not object to cleaning the floor by wiping it with a wet flannel. I think it better than retaining the dirt by ' dry-rubbing': and I do not object to the walls being plastered and painted. It is cheaper than ' Parian,' and, I think, as healthful. 26 June 1883. THE RADCLIFFE INFIRMARY. [308-311.] To THE Secretary to the Charity Commissioners. By a notice in the Oxford University Gazette of this week it appears that the University who are the Trustees of the funded Capital of the Radcliffe Infirmary, are about to trans- fer to the Official Trustees of the Commissioners, a sum of ;£'1,215 14^. 10^/., — 3 per cent. Consolidated Stock, in dis- charge of the Lancashire Fund. The figures given are the exact amount of cash which was paid in May 1870, to the Radcliffe Infirmary by the Trustees of the Lancashire Fund. I take the liberty of submitting for the consideration of the Commissioners, that if Stock is to be now transferred as the equivalent of the Fund, it ought to be according to the value at the time the Fund was paid over to the Infirmary, — i.e. 94^ per cent.; and that the amount of Stock transferred ought to be more in amount, accordingly; — and that a further sum ought also to be transferred to the Official Trustees, on account of the interest received in the past eleven years by the Governors of the Infirmary, without having been applied to the purposes of the Trust. 3 February 1882.

57 Assuming this to be the case, I trust I am not doing wrong in begging the favor that my letter of the 2nd of June may be laid before the Council; — and that, before advising the Crown to grant the Prayer of the petitioning Governors, the attention of the Council may be given to the Trusts of the original endowment in favor of the Sick and Infirm Poor, — and that no powers will be granted, under which the Governors of the Infirmary will be able to set those Trusts aside. Con- sidering the large remission of public taxes which is made in favor of the Infirmary, — Income tax, fire insurance, window tax, inhabited house duty, — and of local taxes, water, gas, and parish rates, — I venture most respectfully to submit that others beside the petitioning Governors have a claim on the attention of the Council. 19 August 1884. » To Dr. Brooks. In answer to your enquiry, — I can not tell who did the surgery of the thorax, — or, indeed, of other regions, — in cases under the Physicians. It was not done by me. The aspirator came into use late in my attendance. I used it in some cases of my own; but never in a case under any of the Physicians. Once I was asked to see a case under one of them, of effusion into the pleura, in which the question of aspiration had arisen before my visit. Next day I was told that the House-Surgeon had done the aspiration; he having been told by the Physician that he might do it. In one case, in the presence of one of the Physicians, I made an opening in the front of the chest, to let out purulent matter presenting there ; and (if I remember right), I made a second opening afterwards in the side. But this was before the general use of the aspirator. The Patient, a boy, had been without treatment in an out-of-the-way place at a distance. It was a case of urgency; and whether admitted under me, or the Physician, I do not now remember.

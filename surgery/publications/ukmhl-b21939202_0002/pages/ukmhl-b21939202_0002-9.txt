Among the notes in this Volume are some which were overlooked when the former Volume was prepared for the Printers. The arrangement in that Volume is not in all parts so clear as might have been, if I had been more at leisure. Some few mistakes were made in the copy supplied to the Printers. The proof sheets, moreover, were not revised with full care : here and there a misprint was overlooked. These should be corrected :— 225, line 8,—no sufficient opportunity 347, „ 10 from bottom,—to enquire into the conduct of the 385, „ 11 from bottom,—the election of the Officer Winchester Road, Oxford, September 1887.

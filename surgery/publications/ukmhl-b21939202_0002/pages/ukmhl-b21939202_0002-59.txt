47 Governors of the Infirmary and the members of the Uni- versity had determined that a Hospital should be built for the poor, that the members of the University might have the Infirmary for their own use; and the ratepayers were to be charged with the expense, — in fact, for the relief of the University Chest. A question had been raised whether the shareholders in the tramways were entitled to vote upon questions affecting the tramways; but no question was raised whether members of the University should vote upon a question which affected their pockets. The Motion was lost, and the Report was approved. [283.] To Professor Prestwich. Thanks for your paper, — On the water-supply. The subject is always of interest to me. Your paper has told me much that I never knew before. Without venturing to attach a definite meaning to the phrase, — 'the present defective sanitary conditions of the supply,'—repeated over and over, in varying words, till people at a distance have come to believe in it, I can not say that I have seen any proof offered that the health of the people here suffers from drinking the water supplied by the City. For the last 6 or 7 years I have not myself drank any other water. April 1885. [265-8.] To Dr. Thorne. Since you were here, I have referred to the Report of the Local Government Board. If I should be upon the Com- mittee, when our new Hospital is built, it might be desirable to examine the Report carefully, and to make myself master of the contents. I can not say there is any one of the plans in the Report which I approve. I have sometimes thought that the art of Hospital-building was among the lost sciences.

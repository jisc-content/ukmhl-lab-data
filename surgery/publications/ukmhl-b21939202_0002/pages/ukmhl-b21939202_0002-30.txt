18 The suggestions made by the Jury are sometimes useful, as leading to the discovery of matters important to the enquiry ; and, under due regulation by the Coroner, are not found to be objectionable in practise. It may be easy to exclude what is irrelevant from the written Depositions; but it will not be so easy in the course of the enquiry to hinder statements that are extraneous or irrelevant from being made by persons called to give evidence, when their knowlege of the facts, and the testimony they can give, have not been previously sifted by a Solicitor. The Coroner should have the power, when he receives in- formation of a death, to take the testimony of the Informant on oath; — and he should also have the power to summon a Medical Practitioner for his opinion or for information, and for making a post-mortem examination, if necessary ; — with power to take the testimony of the Practitioner, on oath or otherwise, as he may think best, before he decides upon further proceedings. In many cases the necessity for a public enquiry would be avoided, if the Coroner could obtain information in an authoritative form from a Medical Practitioner. It has been suggested that the enquiry might in all cases be held by the Coroner without a Jury. It is so in Scotland, — with the difference that the Officer there is called the Pro- curator Fiscal; and that the enquiry is held in private,. .. the special duty of the Officer in Scotland being the discovery of crime, rather than finding the cause of death, as in England.

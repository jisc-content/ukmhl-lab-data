14 THE COLLEGE OF SURGEONS. [392. 400,1.] To J. E. E. Esq. The request made to the Council to acknoivlege the right of those Members of the College who are not Fellows to vote in the Election, ought, I think, to have had from the Council the short and simple answer, that there is no such right under any of the Charters, — and that it can only be had from the Crown ;—-and that the Petition for the purpose ought to be presented to the Home Secretary.

The General Practition- ers have taken the place of the Apothecaries, who have passed off the stage, under the improving hands of the Society of Apothecaries. The men who are calling for the power of voting are Fellows who are not likely to obtain seats in the Council, by the votes of the existing Fellows, and others who wish to get admission, — as they now have into the Council of Education and Regis- tration, — that they may put down (as they think they will,) unqualified or irregular Practitioners, and make education so dear that a poor man will not be able to put a son into the profession. In short, they want ' protection,' which has been withdrawn from every other calling. If the right to vote is given to the Members who are not Fellows, it can not be refused to the Licentiates in Dentistry, or Midwifery. With the right to vote, the right to be elected, must be given. All who hold a qualification under the College, must be admitted equally to give votes, or to receive them. You omit the case of the Colleges in the Universities. There the Fellows have the whole management of the College : they elect into their own body: they choose strangers, or members, as they think fit. The other members of the College

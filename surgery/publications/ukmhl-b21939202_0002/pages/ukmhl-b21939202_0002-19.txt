7 DISLOCATION OF THE SHOULDER. Reduction after eight days by manipulation. As a case of double ' right-angled traction,' the following may be worth publishing. A thin, spare man, below middle height, 70 years of age, employed as helper in some stables, fell on the tip of his shoulder at night 10th July, 1867. He continued at his work, cleaning horses and carriages, and sometimes driving; but he could not raise his elbow, nor could he put his hand behind him. He was sent to me on July 18th, by a Practitioner to whom he applied for relief. The signs of dislocation at the shoulder were well marked, the head of the humerus resting below the coracoid process. After taking off the man's shirt, I laid him on his back upon a table, close to the edge, and attempted to make extension with my foot in the axilla, as I sat on a chair at his side. Finding the position inconvenient, I gave up the attempt. Then, standing at the end of the table, behind the man's shoulder as he lay on his back, I drew the arm away from his side, with the fore-arm flexed at a right angle and the wrist raised perpendicularly upwards, the hand rather inclining to fall downwards. I kept the limb in that position by hooking my finger in the bend of his elbow; and I diverted the man's attention by talking upon indifferent subjects. Forcible extension was not wanted. The muscles soon relaxed, and I then let the hand fall over, thus rotating the head of the humerus inwards, and the bone slipped at once into the glenoid cavity. The man recovered the perfect use of the limb. \Lancet, April 1887.] A HALFPENNY SWALLOWED BY A CHILD. Vomited five weeks afterwards. A little boy, 5 years old, suffering from whooping-cough for seven or eight weeks, was under the care of Dr. Jenkins. On the afternoon of September 10 last he was lying on his belly upon a sofa, and laughing heartily, as he was playing

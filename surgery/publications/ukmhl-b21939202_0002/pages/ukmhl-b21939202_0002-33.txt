21 his office from engaging in practice, comes within the definition of ' being at the time in actual practice/ A question has been raised of the sufficiency of the fee as payment for professional attendance. While it may be ad- mitted that the fee is not large in return for a professional man's time, it should be borne in mind that it is nearly as much as the Coroner gets for work which takes more of his time, and that a Medical Practitioner is the only professional person to whom a payment is made for the attendance before the Coroner; also that it is not thought sound policy by those who are concerned in the administration of justice to remunerate too highly those who are required to give evidence in cases of public enquiry, especially when of a preliminary nature. In the case of analysis being required, in addition to opening the body, the Coroner can, if he thinks fit, obtain power to order payment at a rate commensurate with the skill. A Coroner told me that he had paid Â£37 in one case for a chemical analysis. It has been suggested that the attention of Parliament should be called to the subject, with a recommendation that the fee allowed to a Medical Practitioner should be paid to the Medical Officers of all Hospitals, and that only those officers should be excepted who reside in the Hospital. It is not suggested that the chief Medical Officers of the large Hospitals in London are willing to be included in the general obligation to attend on payment of the statutory fee, or that the managers of these Institutions would allow their Officers to receive the fee.

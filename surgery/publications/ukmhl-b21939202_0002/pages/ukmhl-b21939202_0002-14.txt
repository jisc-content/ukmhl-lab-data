Without wishing to throw a doubt on the value of the lymph taken freshly from cows and calves, I prefer the lymph supplied through the National Vaccine Establishment. This is, I believe, the lymph taken by Dr. Jenner, and passed through a succession of human subjects. I think mischief has been done to the cause of vaccination by the agitation in favor of lymph newly taken from cows. Public confidence has been shaken, upon finding Medical Practitioners taking part in the agitation. It seems like an opinion that the former vaccination was a mistake. The newer opinion may, before long, be thought to be no better. The only way I know of stopping the spread of Small-pox is by vaccination, and thus hindering people from the liability to the contagion. As 'the public health' becomes better under a better knowlege of vaccination, the cases of Small- pox will be few, — or none. June, 1884.

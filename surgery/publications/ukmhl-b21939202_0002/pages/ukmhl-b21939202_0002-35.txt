23 In cases of sudden death, and in cases of death after violence, information generally reaches the Coroner quickly. Open violence is a matter of public notoriety; the circum- stances of the death can not be kept private. The difficulty is, to know what should be done in cases where an act of violence has not become public, or where the Practitioner in attendance sees the circumstances of suspicion which are not so open to others.

What, asks Mr. Browne, could be a more reason- able excuse than the knowlege or belief that the relations of a person who had died an unnatural death, intend to bury the body without an Inquest ? What, — he asks further, — is the object of giving a Certifi- cate which the Practitioner knows ought not to be registered ? Is it not, he adds, to avoid disfavor on the part of the

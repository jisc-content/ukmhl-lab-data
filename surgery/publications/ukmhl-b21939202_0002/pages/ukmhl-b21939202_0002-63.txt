51 [294-308. 321,9. 341. 360. 376.] At the Quarterly Court in April 1864, Mr. S., the Treasurer, proposed that £4^20 should be taken from a fund in hand, — the produce of Life-Subscriptions and donations, — and be added to what he called ' the Income of the House.' He stated that ^900 would still remain in hand. In the Report for 1864, it is stated that this Fund, — arising from Life Sub- scriptions and legacies under ;^100, — had existed for some years, and during the past year had advanced to £909. The special attention of the Governors was afterwards called to this Surplus by a Notice given by Mr. S. At the Court following, I pointed to that notice, still remaining in the Committee Room, in confirmation of the statement I made of there being such a surplus. I once proposed at a Quar\;erly Court that an account should be prepared, showing the balance in the Treasurer's hands on certain days, — the 1st and 15th of each month: the Governors present would not entertain the question. In the Report for 1869 it is stated that the Receits had exceeded the expenditure by about ;^600; and a Balance in hand of ^675 is mentioned in one of the tables at the end of the Report. In the Report for 1871, this balance appears as ;^677: in 1874 it is ;^463 ; in 1875 it is ;^357 ; and 1877 it is ;£"506. I am not sure that the sums stated in the tables are correct, as showing the amount of cash in hand at the end of the different years. In December 1874, the account at the Bankers was overdrawn, by a sum under £6. At the Court in June 1878, Dr. Acland said that over ;^25,000 had been spent in building in the last 30 years : but they had a greater amount of invested Stock at that moment, than when the improvements were begun. In the Report for 1878, appears a new item, — 'Cash at the Bankers, 31 December, 1878,-^:150.' At the Court in April 1880, Mr. S. said that in the course of the last year, they had funded ^^1,600 or ;^1,700. One of the Auditors said that there was ^5,000 more in the 3 per cents, than when he became a Governor. E 2

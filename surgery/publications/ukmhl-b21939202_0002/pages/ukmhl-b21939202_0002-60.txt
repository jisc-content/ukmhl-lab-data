48 There is a remark of Dr. B., which I am disposed to challenge. He says, ' the experience (of distributing cases of Fever through the wards of General Hospitals,) was tried; but with far greater disaster to the Patients and attendants of the General Hospitals.' Is this true of the Patients? Speaking from memory, of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, I do not recall any case of Fever (Scarlet or other,) spreading from a Patient to an other Patient in the Physicians' wards. Are the Hospitals where such a thing has happened as well built and as well managed as St. Bartholomew's ? 21 June, 1883. To THE Same. Thanks for the trouble you have taken, in replying so fully, and giving time, when you are in the full swing of professional work. For about five years,—from 1844 to 1848, — I acted as the only Clerk, and ... if the truth is to be told, ... as much more than Clerk, in Dr. Hue's wards: and, while I saw that almost every new Nurse in our wards, and some in the Surgeons' wards, caught Fever, I do not call to mind any case of Fever, (Scarlet, or other,) spreading in our wards to an other Patient admitted with acute disease. If it did happen, it must have been but seldom. I escaped myself: Dr. Johnstone, my predecessor, caught it, and died. In the Surgeons' wards, — with local injuries, and local diseases,— of course I saw Erysipelas spread, and also Scarlet Fever, and continued Fever sometimes. In private houses I have attended, — as you, no doubt, have, — cases of Fever, which has not spread to others in the house. Why can not the spreading be prevented in a Hospital ? I have looked through the Report on P. with much in- terest. The account of the spreading of Fever is a painful one to read. Is not Fever, of all kinds, more likely to spread in a ' Children's Hospital,'— among the children, and to grown persons ? I should say that three causes want examination, — the construction, the ventilation, and the crowding, (or gathering together,) of the children.

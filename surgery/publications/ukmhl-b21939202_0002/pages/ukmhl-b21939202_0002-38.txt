26 'FOOTBALL FATALITIES.' In the Medical Times and Gazette of Saturday, it is stated that the son of the Principal of J. College died from injuries caused when playing at football. Your readers may, perhaps, be willing to receive this explanation of the circumstances of the case. One evening I saw it stated in a newspaper that the lad in question had died from the effects of an injury at football at S. School. Next day, in the course of conversation with a Practitioner whom I met accidentally, I heard that the lad died in Oxford at his Father's house. Upon the statement publicly made, attributing the death to an act of violence, and upon the death within this City, I felt it to be my duty to call upon the Registrar for the certificate on which the death had been registered; and, as it did not refer to the alleged injury, I went to Dr. T. the Practitioner who had certified. Dr. T. told me that the circumstances of the injury had not escaped his attention ; that the injury, such as it was, had been received in March, and that the lad continued the game without being disabled. He continued in perfect health for a month ; and he had since passed a highly creditable examination in book-work. Dr. T. said that, though the illness followed the injury, the long interval of perfect health made him hesitate to accept the injury as the necessary cause of the illness, or to withhold his certificate of death from natural causes. To this I take the liberty of adding that, with the facts brought to my knowlege, I considered there was no cause for interference on the part of the Coroner.

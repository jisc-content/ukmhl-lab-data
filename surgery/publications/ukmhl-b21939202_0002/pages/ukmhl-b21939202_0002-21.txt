9 [Medical Times and Gazette, November 1885.] water on the table in her drawing-room ; a pet dormouse be- longing to one of the children was running about on the table, over the child's hand and arm. The child said the dormouse was thirsty, and she took her little thimble, filled it with water from the glass, and offered it to the dormouse. The animal drank it readily. In a minute or two it fell over on its back ; and after a short struggle, died on the table.' The yellow aconite would thus seem not to be quite so inactive as has been assumed. [^Medical Times and Gazette, February 1882.] MEDICAL KNIGHTS. You tell us that you look forward to a long line of Pro- vincial Medical Knights. Few of your readers will, I think, take the same view. During my attendance as a pupil at St. Bartholomew's Hospital — some five and forty years ago, — I remember that I once asked an old practitioner some question about Sir James Earle and other gentlemen of title, whose names were known in connection with the Hospital. He told me that it had been the custom to knight the Senior Surgeon of the Hospitals in London: that, when it came to Mr. Abernethy's turn to receive the honor, he declined it. Mr. Vincent did the same ; and the Minister ceased to recom- mend the Surgeons for the honor. The number of Medical Practitioners in possession of the honor has been declining for some years. Passing the Baronets, and the Knights of the different Orders, it appears from published lists of Knights Bachelors, to which I have the opportunity of referring, that there were 33 members of the medical profession among the number in 1849, and 17 in 1871. At the present time there are 10,—which is less than a tenth part of the number of Lawyers now on the list.

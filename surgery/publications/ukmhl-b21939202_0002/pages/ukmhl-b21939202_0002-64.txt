52 After Mr. S. ceased to be Treasurer, an item appears in the Report of each year, —' Cash at the Bankers.' In 1883 it is £907; in 1884 the amount is £527 : the correct sums, I think, were ^719 in 1883 ; and ;^1,466 in 1884. In 1885 the sum in the Report is ;£"1082; and in 1886 it is ;^1,411. In April 1886, the Treasurer told the Governors there was ;^2,450 at the Bankers. The words ' deficit' and ' embarrassment,' and the phrases ' adverse balance' and ' financial difficulty' have a wonderful effect on many of those who read them, without knowing how figures are put together, and such things made. There are not often persons at a Charitable Institution who ask what amount of cash the Treasurer has in his hands, nor whether there is a sufficit^ for the work of the House. [263-6.] In a Memoir of the Cholera in Oxford in 1854, by Dr. Acland, are some remarks upon the introduction of gas into the Radcliffe Infirmary ; and that a protest against its intro- duction without ventilating tubes was signed by the Physicians, and two of the Surgeons. One of the Physicians withdrew his signature afterwards; and one of the Surgeons told me that, when the paper was sent to him for signature, he signed it in the belief that he should have an explanation of the subject afterwards. He, and the other Surgeon who signed it, were afterwards most urgent that the gas should be introduced into the wards with- out delay, whether with ventilating tubes, or without. It was then introduced into the Surgeons' wards : but not into the Physicians' wards till after the publication of the Memoir.

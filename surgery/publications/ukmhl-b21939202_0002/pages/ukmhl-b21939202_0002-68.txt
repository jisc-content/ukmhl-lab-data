56 real objects of Charity, while admission has been given to other persons, — Members of the University and others,— who have no claim either by reason of their pecuniary circum- stances, or the sickness under which they are laboring. The Radclifife Infirmary seems to be one of the endowments to which the remarks lately made in Parliament by the President of the Board of Trade apply, — that there is going on a transfer of property from the Poor to the Rich. From the terms of the Petition it might be thought that the land with which the Charity is endowed consists of the whole of what was given upon the first foundation. The fact is that two pieces of the ground have been given away by the Trustees, — one in 1835 for a Church and Church-yard, and an other piece in 1845 for a School-house. The funded Capital is held by the University as the Trustees, without any deed or written Declaration of Trust: and while the Trustees are bound to pay over the annual proceeds to the Governors of the Infirmary, it is generally understood that, in such a case, the Trustees are bound to hold the Capital without diminution: the University have on several occasions made a sale of large sums, which have not been replaced. I venture most respectfully to submit for the consideration of the Council, that the Trustees of the land ought to make good the full value of the land as originally conveyed to them ; and that the University, as the Trustees of the funded Capital, ought to replace the money to the full amount of what they have ever held; — and that this should be done before they are released from their Trusts under the proposed new Charter. 2 June 1884. To THE SAME. Referring to my letter of the 2nd of June, and to yours in reply of the 14th of June, — I see by a note in one of the Medical Journals that a Petition from some of the Governors of the Radcliffe Infirmary has since been presented ; and that it is to be taken into consideration on the 25th of September.

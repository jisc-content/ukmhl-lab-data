22 UNSATISFACTORY INQUESTS. From letters in late numbers of the Journal, it seems that one of your correspondents has written to the Registrar- General upon the subject of unsatisfactory Inquests; and, in reply, he has been told that the Practitioner in attendance during the last illness of a patient can not withhold the cer- tificate of death required by the Registration Act, and that the duty of communicating with the Coroner may be safely left to the Registrar. To these two points I beg the attention of your readers. Under the Registration Act, no period is named for the Practitioner in attendance to sign and give the certificate. Five days are allowed for the friends of the deceased person to give information of the death to the Registrar, — taking with them the certificate from the Practitioner. Few of your readers will, I think, be inclined to doubt that the Practitioner would be acting within the terms of the law, if he paused for five days before giving the certificate, in a case where he had any suspicion that the death did not happen from natural causes, by the visitation of God, or until he had assurance that the Coroner did not require an Inquest. The Registrars, for the most part, do well what is often an unpleasant part of their duty ; but my experience as a Coroner does not enable me to agree in the opinion that the duty of communicating with the Coroner may be safely left to the Registrars in all cases; though I think it may well be left to many of them. Some Registrars think that, when informa- tion of the death is given by the friends of the deceased person, with the certificate from a Practitioner, their duty under the Registration Act is to register the death, and the cause of it as stated in the certificate, without further question ; and such Registrars will do so, whatever the terms of the certificate. In a case of doubt or suspicion, few Practitioners will be found to certify the death from an unknown cause; hardly any, I think, will add that an Inquest is necessary, — a thing for the Coroner's opinion, not the Practitioner's.

25 his death was caused by the injuries received, were well known to the Officers of the House. A certificate that his death was caused by a fractured spine was given for the purpose of registration, and the body was removed from the Infirmary. No notice of the case was given to me. I take the liberty, as Coroner, of calling the attention of the Committee of Management to these irregularities. The length of time which passed between the receit of the injuries and the day of death, does not affect the duties of the Coroner. 12 April 1887. [330,1,2. 343, 367.] To THE SAME. C. P. died in the Radcliffe Infirmary in May last, after an operation performed, as I understand, without the previous consultation of all the Surgeons of the House. The body was buried before I heard of it. From rumors about the case, — that a mistake had been made in the opinion formed by the Surgeons, I called upon the Registrar of Deaths for the Medical Certificate on which the death was registered. The cause of death is there stated to be, — Excision of uterine fibromata; — no mention is made of excision of anything else. Assuming the information I received to be correct, the fact that death followed an operation, or a course of treatment, adopted under an erroneous opinion, is not of itself a reason for holding an Inquest. I took no further steps in the matter. Being in London yesterday at a Meeting of Coroners, I mentioned the case; and I learned that, in the opinion of other Coroners, the fact that a false Certificate of the cause of death had been given, was of itself a reason for holding an Inquest, and that, if necessary, the body would be dug up for the purpose. I beg the favor of your submitting this to the consideration of the Committee of Management. 26 July 1887.

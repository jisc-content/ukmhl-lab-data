20 It has been held by the Judge of one of the County Courts that the sick wards of a workhouse are within the terms of the Statute as a ' Public Hospital or Infirmary.' In cases before me, I always paid the fee to the Medical Officer of the Workhouse. It seemed to me that the workhouses had been overlooked when the words of the Statute were settled; and that the same thing had happened with some other institu- tions. There are establishments, with Infirmaries attached, and Medical Officers regularly in attendance, which partake more or less of the nature of the public Institutions described in the Statute, Among them may be named â€” prisons, mili- tary hospitals, public schools, training colleges, almshouses and asylums for the aged, dispensaries, cottage hospitals, nurses' homes, and perhaps others which have been instituted during the 50 years which have passed since the Medical Witness Act.

If medical evidence is wanted at the Inquest, the Coroner will often call one of the officers resident in the Hospital; and he then receives the fee allowed. It is, I think, open to question whether the House-Surgeon, who is forbidden by the rules of

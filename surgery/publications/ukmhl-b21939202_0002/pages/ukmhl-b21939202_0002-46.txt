34 without interference, and should be allowed sufficient time for every member to form his opinion on all points of the subject referred to the Committee. He was not then raising any question of the duties of the Governors of the Infirmary under the trusts of the Lancashire Fund. The time for such a question would not come until the Committee made their report. He did not raise any question of the management of the Infirmary. He was aware that the Managers had applied to the Charity Commissioners to sanction a scheme for the administration of the Lancashire Fund; and he was also aware that they had got a new Chairman at the Infirmary. In these altered circumstances, he thought the members of the Board would be inclined to say that public bodies moved slowly; and that the Infirmary ought to be allowed time to consider their position, and to make arrangements. He assented to that; and he would not have brought the subject now before the Board, but for the circumstance that at the first meeting of Governors of the Infirmary, at which the new Chairman was present, he gave notice that he intended to raise the question of the obligation of the Infirmary to take in cases of Scarlet fever, instead of throwing it on the Local Board. Scarlet fever was one of those classes of infectious Fever Vs^hich he, and some others, thought the Infirmary was bound to take. The proceedings showed that the question was not settled; and he thought it right to bring this new branch of it to the notice of the Board. The motion was agreed to. At the Board, July 1881, Mr. Hussey proposed that it be referred to the Nuisance Removal Committee to consider the means within the district for treating cases of Fever arising in persons without proper lodging and accommodation, and report to the Board accordingly. He did not think there would be any opposition to the enquiry. It was, however, decided that the question should be referred to a Special Committee.

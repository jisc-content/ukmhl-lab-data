27 wife. In the evidence, as reported in the Daily News, it is stated that the child weighed only 25 pounds at death, when it should have weighed 45 pounds. In the tables prepared by Dr. Boyd and Dr. Sharpey the average weight of a female child from 4 to 7 years of age is given as 24 pounds and 9 ounces.

Referring to ' B.'s' enquiry in the Law Journal of the 12th inst., of the Coroner's power to punish for contempt, if com- mitted in Court, allow me to say that it is doubtful whether the Coroner has the power of inflicting a fine. In Pater s Case, the power of the Court of Quarter Sessions to inflict a fine was allowed by the Court of Queen's Bench. The question of the Coroner's power has not been before the Superior Courts. The power to commit is generally claimed in the text- books. The only case with which I am acquainted is Sproston v. Davis, which was tried at the assizes at Warwick in March 1851, before Mr. Baron Alderson. Certain points reserved were brought before the Court of Exchequer in May 1851. Some of the particulars have been communi- cated to me by the plaintiff"; but I have not seen any report of the case. A short reference to the case appears in the * Justice of the Peace,' 1854, p. 206, as a case 'not reported.' It is said that the Coroner's power of committing for con- tempt was admitted by the Court. At a later page the Editor adds: ' There are reasons for doubting whether the Court were altogether satisfied with the decision after they had pronounced it. The point, therefore, can scarcely be considered as settled.' The mode of procedure by imprisonment, and the form of process are undefined : I do not know any precedent. The Law Journal, July 1884.

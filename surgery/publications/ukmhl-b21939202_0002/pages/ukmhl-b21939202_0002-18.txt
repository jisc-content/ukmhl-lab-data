6 'SURGICAL MISHAPS/ One of the cases mentioned by Mr. Teale reminds me of a case formerly under my care. In 1861 a young Lady applied to me with a small tumor behind the angle of the jaw on the right side. It was tough and almost cartilaginous under examination, and the skin was generally adherent over the surface. The case had been seen by the late Mr. Hester and Mr. Owen of Oxford, and by Sir H. Acland. It was thought to be of a cystic nature ; and the swelling had been injected with Tincture of Iodine. I cut through the substance in its whole thickness, and endeavored to clear away the contents from each half; this could only be done to a very slight extent. The wound healed favorably. A second operation was undertaken some months afterwards, the skin was divided, and separated without difficulty from the tumor. This now appeared to be about the size of a large walnut and of a fibro-cellular structure. I cut off the exposed part, so as to clear the wound for a deeper dissection. Then, fixing a hook in the remaining part, I endeavored to draw it forward. This I was unable to do. The attachment was evidently very deep ; the skull itself moved with the motions of the hook. I cut off, as deeply as I could, the part of the tumor which was transfixed by the hook, and closed the wound. This healed as favorably as after the former opera- tion. The Lady afterwards married ; and she died with phthisis more than twenty years after the operation. There was not any fresh growth of the tumor. Being in communication with Mr. Caesar Hawkins at the time of the operation, I mentioned the case as a disagreeable piece of active surgery. He told me that Mr. Liston, in a similar case, found, upon the death of the patient, that the tumor had its origin in the base of the skull. [Lancet, February 1887.]

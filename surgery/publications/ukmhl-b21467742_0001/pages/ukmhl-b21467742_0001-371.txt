Bakehouses.—From the point of view of the public licalth of the community bake- liouses may easily become a danger to the workmen employed in them or to the consumers of the bread there baked. They should l)e built for the purpose of baking, for underground rooms can rarely be safely adapted. No w.e., privy, or ashpit should be within or communi- cate directly with a bakehouse ; its water-supply should be separate from that for a w.c.; and no drain or pipe for carrying off sewage should have an ojaening within it. It should be well lighted and ventilated, and should not be used as or communicate with a sleeping apartment; and separate rooms should be provided for the different processes. Baker's Itch.

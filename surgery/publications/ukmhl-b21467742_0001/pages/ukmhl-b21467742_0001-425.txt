If, however, cystitis is set up, and the consistino- of uric acid, oxalate of lime, and urine becomes alkaline, phosphates are then pliosphates of lime, ammonia, and magnesia; present for about six weeks. p,,.. ....phosphatic calculus from a fenial.' bladder, containing a liair-pin as its nucleus. Fio. 3.—Oxalate of lime calculus, showing a tuberculateil surface,!coated in places with a layer of phosphates. Projecliini; from one end of tlie calculus is a piece of glass rod. From a male, aged 2S years. (Nat. size.) Fig. 4.—Section of a calculus containing a double nucleus oi oxalate of lime. The body consists of alternating layers of uric acid and oxalate of lime, and there is a thick crust or extreme layer (Nat. .size.) composed of phosphates. From a male. Fio. 5.—Oxalate of lime calculus with an unusually spiculated surface. From a male, aged 52 years. (Nat. size.) deposited upon it. This accounts for the fact tliat many uric acid or oxalate of lime calculi are coated with phosphates, and also explains why calculi, wliose nucleus consists of a foreig'u body, are usually pliosphatic throiiohout. rarer forms are composed of vu-ate of anunonia, carbonate or phosphate of lime, cystine, and xanthine.

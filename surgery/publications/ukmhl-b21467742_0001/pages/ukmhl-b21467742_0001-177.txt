The method may be briefly deseribcd as follows : The patient's arms are liriuly grasped just above the elbow, and firmly |ircsscd agaiust tiie thoracic parietes, so as to imi- tate cxpi ratio It, and fully extended an<l the thorax expanded, xpirdl iijii, the ex- tended arms being drawn upwards and on t w a rds ; a f t e r e<iunting three they are brought again to the side of the chest, the natural rhthym of the respiiratiou being followed as closely as jiossible. The recovery of the patient will depend on the care with wdiich each movement is performed rather than the frequency. When the patient is slight one person can carry on the movements unaided, but if the patient be heavily built, effort will be fatiguing, and an assistant will be needed, each person taking an arm. The complete nianiijula- tion should be carried out about lf> times in a nunute. Sehafer's method of artificial respira- tion, while much more easily carried out by any one single-handed, is not so well adapted for anaisthetie work. The patient has to be laid in tlu' ]irone position, and the disadvantages of this in abdominal anil many other operations are suftieientlj' obvious.

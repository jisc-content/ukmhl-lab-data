APHASIA 239 complete agraphiu, though it does (usually) produce paragraphia. Tactile Aphasia.—There is every reason to suppose that blind people, who have learned to read and write by the sense of touch, are occasionally aifected with what may be termed tactile aphasia; but, so far as I know, no case of the kind has been actiudly recorded. CoMiiiNED Forms of Aphasia. — Cases of isolated aphasia (uncomplicated word-deaf- ness, uncomplicated motor - vocal aphasia, un- complicated word-blindness, and uncomplicated agi'aphia) are probably less frequent than cases of aphasia in which more than one of the speech faculties is involved and deranged. This is due to the following causes:—(1) That the subcortical sensory aphasias are moi'c difficult to pi'oduce than the cortical forms; for, to pi'oduce sub- cortical word - deafness or subcortical word- blindness, the lesion must interrupt all of the att'erent fibres passing to the auditory speech centre or the visual speech centre from the lower auditory or visual centres respectively ; whereas the cortical forms of word-deafness and word-blindness may be produced by localised lesions which destroy the auditory or visual speech centres respectively. (2) That the actions of the different speech centres are, to a large extent, mutually dependent one upon another ; consequently a lesion in one of the cortical speech centres will (usually) pi'oduce more or less marked derangement of the action of the others. These derangements are, I think, usually most marked when the auditory speech centre is involved ; much less marked (excejit so far as writing is concerned) when the visual speech centi-e is involved; very slight, and in many cases not obvious, when the motor-vocal speech centre is involved ; and not produced at all when the motor-writing centime is involved (though T speak with hesitation regarding the functiiin of the visual speech centre). (3) That the two sensoiy speech centres (the auditory speech centre and the visual speech centre) on the one hand, and the motor-vocal speech centre and the motor-writing centre on the other, are situated in close juxtaposition and continuity. Hence a lesion which involves the auditory speech centre is very likely at the same time to involve the visual speech centi-e, and vice versa ; and a lesion which involves the motor- vocal speech centre is very likely at the same time to involve the motor-writing centre, and rice verm. (4) That all of these speech centres are supplied by the same artery (the middle cerebral), and that the branches which supply the auditory speech centre and the visual speech centre on the one hand, and the branches which supply the motor-vocal speech centre and the motor-writing centre on the other, come oft" in close juxtaposition. Hence the frequency with which word-deafness and word-blindness on the one hand, and motor-vocal aphasia and agraphia 1 on the other, are combined in those cases in which the aphasia is due (as it most frequently is) to softening, the result of arterial obstruction, whether embolic or tlu'ombotic. Total Aphasia.—-The fact that all of tlie great speech centres are supplied by the same (middle cerebral) artery also, of course, explains the occurrence of total aphasia—a combination of word-deafness, word-blindness, motor-vocal aphasia and agraphia—when the main trunk of the middle cerebral or Sylvian artery is plugged by an embolon or is thrombosed. Commissural Aphasia.—To provide for the intimate associations which exist between the different speech centres, connecting and commis- sural fibres are, of course, necessary; and it cannot be doubted that a variety of aphasic symp- toms may be due to interruption or destruction of these connecting fibres, the sjjeech centres themselves, the afferent fibres proceeding to the sensory speech centres, and the efferent fibres passing oft' from the motor-vocal speech centre and the motor-writing centre being unaftected by the lesion. These connection, commissural, or con- duction forms of aphasia, as they are sometimes termed, probably differ in some particulars from the cortical and subcortical forms of aphasia which have already been described; but I doubt whether, in the present state of our knowledge, it is advisable to regard them as distinct forms of ayihasia ; their characteristic features (if they have characteristic features) are as yet unknown. The Association of Aphasia and Motor Paralysis.—The frequent association of aphasia with motor paralysis (aphasia and right hemi- plegia in right-handed persons, and of aphasia and left hemiplegia in left-handed persons) is, of course, due to the fact that the middle cerebral artery supplies not only the speech centres, but the motor area of the cortex. DlA(iNOSIS Aphasia is a symptom, or rather a group of symptoms, not a disease ; consequently in the diagnosis of a supposed case of aphasia we must endeavour to determine, in the first place, whether the speech defects which are present are actually aphasic in character ; in the second place, what is the position of the lesion (ana- tomical diagnosis) ; and in the thirrJ place, what is the pathological character of the lesion (pathological diagnosis). In the definition of aphasia which has been given at the beginning of this article I have stated that, in my opinion, only those speech derangements should be included under the term aphasia which ai'e due to functional dis- tui-bance or organic disease of the higher cerebral speech mechanisms properly so called. In my opinion the term aphasia should not include defects in the perception of spoken and written speech due to disease iu the end-organs

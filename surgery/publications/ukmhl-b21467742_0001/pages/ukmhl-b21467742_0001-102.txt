ALCOHOL 84 convulsant poison, may be present. A know- ledge of these by-products is important, as their presence is frequently the cause of the toxic symptoms seen in alcoholism. I'ests.—The presence of alcohol is detected by the " iodoform test" (a few crystals of iodine warmed in the sample with just enough KHO to decolourise the iodine); this, however, also reacts with bodies of the general formula CH3 . CO . C, or CH3 . CH(OH) . C. The " ethyl benzoate " test (benzyl chloride and warmth), the " acetic ether" test (sodium acetate, sul- phuric acid and warmth), and the " chromic acid" test (a small crystal and warmth give a green colour) are not conclusive singly. The guaiacum and the molybdic acid tests described by Elias H. Bartley are delicate tests. To a filtered extract of guaiacum powder a few drops dilute HCN solution and a drop of weak CuSO^ solution are added. If 1 per cent or more alcohol be present, a blue colour is pro- duced. A solution of 1 part of molybdic acid in 10 of strong H.2SO4 is allowed to run down the side of the test-tube containing the suspected liquid. If alcohol, ether, or aldehyde be present, a blue ring will form at the junction of the two liquids. This will detect 0"1 per cent alcohol. Spirits.—The alcoholic strength of spirits is as follows :— Absolute alcohol—95-5-99-5 per cent. Rectified spirit—90 per cent. Proof spirit—57'09 per cent by volume, or 49'3 per cent by weight.^ Methylated spii-it — Pure form, 90 per cent alcohol of density 0'830 and 10 per cent purified wood spirit; common form con- tains in addition petroleum oil. Genuine brandy or Cognac — Distilled from wine, contains oenantbic and other ethers, 35-45 per cent. Rum—Distilled from molasses, contains butylic ether, 50-70 per cent. Gin or Hollands—Flavoured with juniper and sugar, 50-60 per cent. Whisky—Needs mellowing to remove excess of fusel oil and traces of furfurol, 50-60 per cent. German spirit is obtained from potato, Japan- ese spirit from rice or sorghum, Arak from cocoa-nut or palm juice. Sweet liquors and bitters are compounded from alcohol and aromatic essences. Mead obtained from honey, and koumiss from mare's milk, are solitary instances of the alcoholic fermentation of animal products. Genuine wines are the product of a spon- 1 For the purposes of excise, the strength of alcohol in solutions is compared with proof spirit, not alcohol, and estimated in percentages or degrees above or below proof. Proof spirit should weigh exactly x-jths of an equal measure of distilled water. taneous fermentation of the juice of the grape, and in the case of sparkling wines of a second- ary fermentation of added sugar. Some are sold which are wholly artificial, others are only partly derived from the grape. They are liable to various manipulations, " blendings," and " flavourings" with ethers, etc., to imitate definite brands and vintages. Some are fortified, and many French, Spanish, and Italian wines are " plastered," tartrate of lime being pre- cipitated, and potassium sulphate, which is said to produce cirrhosis of the liver, remaining in solution, whilst the calcium carbonate accom- panying the gypsum precipitates any free tartaric acid, leaving malic acid only as the representative of the original acidity. Wines.—Wines may be classified as—(1) spirituous wines, (2) sweet or liqueur wines, (3) clarets or Bordeaux, (4) Burgundies, and (5) Rhine or Moselle wines. Their Constituents.—All wines contain colour- ing matters, and subtle principles which give flavour, bouquet, and aroma. Their further composition may be tabulated as follows:— Alcohol—7 to 20 per cent. Acids — Tartaric, malic, succinic, butyric, hydrochloric, and sulphuric. Sugar—Traces only ; or 1'5 to 9 per cent in sweet wines. Extractives—1"5 to 10 per cent. Tannin—From the skins and pips or from the cask. Glycerine—0"2 to 0'6 per cent. Mucin and albumen—Traces only. Ash—0-2 to 0-4 per cent. The acids are partly combined with potas- sium, sodium, calcium, magnesium, aluminium, and iron. The Average Pehcentagbs of Alcohol, op Sogaii, and OF Acidity in Wines accobding to Konig (qooted BY VON Leyden). The free acidity, reckoned as tartaric acid, varies between 0"2 per cent to 0-4 per cent in the better wines and 0'7 per cent in the inferior. Wine containing less than 0'6 per cent is dull; but with more than 1 per cent it becomes un- palatable (von Leyden). Beer differs from wine and other alcoholic liquors in its high nutritive value.

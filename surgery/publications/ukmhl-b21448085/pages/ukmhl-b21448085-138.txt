FOURTH REPORT. 110 tion, that when the accident of bursting does take place, after giving free passage to the urine, it must be one of our principal objects to allay the irritation. r As it is probable, that in the prosecution of the work, I may have new opportunities of describing the effect of injuries to the perineum, I shall not here speak of the extravasation of the urine from the urethra when ruptured by external violence. The Subject continued.â€”Cases of Urinary Abscess. tlnder this head, we consider all those abscesses which are occasioned either by the irritation with- in, the urethra causing abscess external to it, or by the escape of urine through ulceration of the canal. For it will be remembered by the surgical student, that the urine does not always escape as in these examples just delivered, at once abroad into the cellular membrane. It will now appear, that sometimes it makes its way by little at a time, and by the irritation of its presence produces ab- scess. While the surgeon is inattentive to the differ- ent ways in which the urinary abscess forms, he must be liable to produce them by his improper in- terference with the urethra; and I am inclined to think, that many have produced such abscesses while innocent of the knowledge that they were themselves the cause.

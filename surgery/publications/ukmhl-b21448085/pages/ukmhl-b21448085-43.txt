CASES OF DISEASES AND WOUNDS, &C. 15 tule upon the margin of the glottis. Sudden death, from a cause seemingly so trifling, made a strong impression upon me, and from that time I have omitted no opportunity of searching into the diseases of the trachea. On this, and on many other occasions, it will be necessary to refer to the preparations in my collection, both as authorities on which to ground my reasoning, and in order to keep the reader’s attention to the facts of morbid anatomy. We shall commence our observations on the most secure grounds, having before us the catalogue of what is most useful to be known of the appearances on dissections* *. XI. 1. M. 1, 2,3,4. In these four examples of disease of the larynx, we see the nature of the membrane of croup. It is formed by inflamma- tion of the membrane lining the larynx and tra- chea, by which a proportion of coagulable lymph larynx will cause suffocation. See an example in “ Bulletin de la faculty de Medicine, 1814, par M. Chaussier.” * And here I may observe, that those practitioners, who only occasionally visit the capital, will ever find a ready admission to the Museum in Windmill-street, and a gentleman to direct them to the objects of inquiry, in reference to this work. To those members of the profession who reside iu town, the Mu- seum will be open, during the winter, from eleven till twelve in the forenoon, twice a week. By this arrangement I shall find myself more at liberty to refer to those things which are open to public inspection, without overloading the work with engrav- ings.

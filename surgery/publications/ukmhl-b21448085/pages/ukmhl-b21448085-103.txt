CASES OF DISEASED PHARYNX, &C. 75 the application of the caustic. He says he never was better in his life. Thursday 10th. The caustic again applied. Sunday 13th. He has been quite well. He swallows his bread and tea with ease, and nothing is returned. He is very desirous of returning home, as he affirms that he is well, and his wife about to be confined. While the patient feels no inconvenience, and is quite satisfied of his recovery, the bougie is still obstructed.â€”Dismissed. This man remained well for a considerable time, and had no return of the stricture; but dying of some other disease, the surgeon in the country reported, that he could discover no marks of dis- ease in the oesophagus. I shall make no remarks upon this case, until I have put into your hands a pure specimen of the stricture of the oesophagus. By this I mean a case where the stricture was a consequence of inflam- mation, without the interference of the surgeon either to mar or to mend. I am indebted for this specimen of disease to Mr. Goolden, of Maidenhead, a gentleman whose professional character bestows an additional value on what he communicates.

CASES OF FEMORAL HERNIA. 195 diseased gland. There is an appearance, as of the pointing of an abscess, for there is a point more prominent and soft, and evidently containing fluid. On further examination, there is crepitus; it is not a watery fluid, but air which is contained within this part of the tumour. This poor womanâ€™s face indicates that there is no hope. There is a character of the eyes, declaring that she is struck with death ; the features are shrunk. The belly is tumid, but soft and painful on pressure; the pulse is small and quick. She had an evacuation from the bowels last night, which, however, pn inquiry, proves to have been in very small quantity. While preparing for opera- tion, she has one of her attacks, which come in paroxysms ; during it she rolls in bed, and cries aloud, which, with the death-like aspect of her face, declares her extremity; during these pa- roxysms her pulse is not to be felt. In operation, unusual difficulty was experienced in dissecting back the skin from the tumour, for it was thickened and condensed by inflammation. But having exposed the tumour, the soft and prominent part of it was found to be a vesicle, thin and dis- tended with air, and which, both in colour and the character of its vessels, had a remarkable resemblance to a portion of intestine. Layer after layer of this thin membrane being lifted on the directory, it burst, and discharged a fluid of the consistence of cream, yellow, and very foetid, evidently feculent. I laid open the sac, let out more pus and air.

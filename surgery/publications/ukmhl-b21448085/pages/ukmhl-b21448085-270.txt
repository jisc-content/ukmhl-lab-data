226 AMPUTATION AT THE SHOULDER JOINT. From these dissections, the following conclusions may be drawn :â€”First, that, in many cases the en- larged portion of the prostate, which projects into the bladder, is not the third lobe, but a more an- terior part of the gland. In the second place, it appears, that where there is a valvular projection into the bladder, the mus- cles of the ureters are found to be inserted at the root of the tumour. Thirdly. It appears that whenever there is this valvular projection from the prostate, the muscles of the ureters are found enlarged. It will perhaps be admitted, as in part a cor- roboration of what I have stated, that I cannot find in any book the description of a dissection of the back part of the prostate, where there was a valvu- lar projection into the bladder; nor have I seen any drawing of a perpendicular section of the dis- eased gland, which could give a correct idea of the relation between the third lobe and the portion which projects into the bladder. OBSERVATIONS ON THE AMPUTATION AT THE SHOULDER JOINT, AND ON THE EXCISION OP THE HEAD OF THE HUMERUS, IN CASES OF GUN-SHOT FRACTURES. The consideration of such subjects recals to my mind the cases which I have seen in military prac-

SECOND REPORT. 32 SECOND CASE OF SUFFOCATION, vaoyt SJIccr of tt)t Mary Ann Mellon. Mr. Heath, our apothecary, the same intelligent gentleman who so kindly at- tended the last patient, heard this unfortunate girl in the street, calling to her companion, or rather attempting to do so. He was familiar with the peculiar husky sound, and by that, knowing her condition, he spoke to her, and desired her to come to the Hospital. Some days afterwards she took his advice. On the 6th of March she came to the Hospital, and was seen by Dr. Southey. On the 12th of the same month she returned, and was taken into the house. The day before this she was walking in the streets, at her usual pace. She walked to the Hospital, carrying her bundle; in going up stairs she stopt to recover breath ; she was full of anxi- ous inquiries, and said that she must surely die. Half an hour after coming into the Hospital, and sitting on her bed, she fell suddenly back, and died without a struggle. The apothecary and house-surgeon were imme- diately called. They perforated the larynx, and introduced the pipe of the apparatus of the Hu- mane Society, but their efforts were unavailing.

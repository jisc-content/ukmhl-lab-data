210 CASES OF FEMORAL HERNIA. the slighter adhesions which it has to the surround- ing or outer sac ; we have seen in one of the pre- ceding cases, that the membrane left, after the reduction of the gut, was so transparent, that when the serum flowed from the belly, and filled the sac a second time, it appeared like an hydatid ; and in the last example of all, the colour of the intestine was given to its membranous covering, in that de- gree, to make the surgeon reduce both the gut and the peritoneum ; for myself, I must confess, that I was for a moment mistaken, and both the sac and intestine were reduced before I had an opportunity of giving an opinion, which, during an operation, is a'delicate matter, unless it be asked. The success in this operation was perfect, which makes it the more necessary to consider the sub- ject, else, in imitation of this, a practice may obtain which would be very dangerous. In the splendid work of Mr. Cooper, there is an example given, where, by mistake, the sac was returned with the intestine, the symptoms of strangulation continued, and the patient was lost. I have, in my Surgery, stated, that Le Dran reduced the sac with the in- testine, and that the neck of the sac continued to embrace the intestine, and the patient died. It appears then, that it is not uncommon to mistake the peritoneal sac of a femoral hernia, for the gut itself; and who in this are to blame so much as those, who in their works fail to distinguish betwixt the difference of sacs in the several kinds of hernia P It is further evident, that it is possible to reduce both the sac and the intestine in the case of femoral

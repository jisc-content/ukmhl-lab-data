149 FRACTURE OF TIIE SPINE. the vertebra gives way before the ligaments yield. But here is an instance of diastasis or subluxa- tion of the bodies of twb of the vertebrae. From Hippocrates to the multitude of French authors who have touched upon this subject, dislocation has been considered in no other light formidable, than as producing pressure on the spinal marrow. But this case serves well to shew, that luxation will prove fatal, even although the spinal marrow be not bruised. The last writer who treats of this subject is M. Boyer. He observes, that in the violent bending- forward of the spine, the ligamenta interspinalia are sometimes ruptured, but that no bad conse- quence results ; rest restores the part. But the rupture of the ligamentum subflavum (ligament jaune) is followed by paraplegia and death, and without doubt, he adds, it is because the spinal marrow itself suffers distention. The foregoing case will place this matter in another light. It is the progress of inflammation to the spinal marrow, and not the pressure or the extension of it, which makes those cases of subluxation and breach of the continuity of the tube fatal. The alternation of symptoms in this case is worthy of attention. DISLOCATION OF THE PROCESSUS DENTATUS OF THE SECOND VERTEBRA SUDDENLY FATAL.

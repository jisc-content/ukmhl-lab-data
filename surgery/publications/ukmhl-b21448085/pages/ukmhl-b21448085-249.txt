CASES OF FEMORAL HERNIA. 205 the gut was found but very little distended ; not at all discoloured, and adhering by means of coagulable lymph to the neck and great part of the inside of the sac. Â£*5] I think I never saw the stricture on the neck of the sac so narrow. It required time and the ut- most nicety to insinuate the directory. It could only be introduced on the side of the stricture towards the pubes. The probe-pointed bistoury being introduced upon the groove of the directory, and the stricture cut, it was not difficult to reduce the small portion of the intestine ; for the coagulable lymph was as yet soft which formed the adhesion. The moment this was done, the serum rushed from the abdomen, and the stream of fluid catch- ing tbe edge of the sac, made a beautiful exhibition of it; for it appeared like a hydatid, it was so thin and delicate. On the third day, there arose pain and swelling in the abdomen ; it was partial, so that the part she complained of, could be covered with the hand. This yielded to leeches and a large blister; and she is now doing well. Remarks on the last Case. * 1.

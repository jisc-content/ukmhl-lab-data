3 ON CANCER. desirous of promoting inquiry on the subject of cancer, they have remained uncontaminated by that love of quackery which is so common among the gentry of England, and have referred these pro- posals to their medical officers. Of the subjects brought into notice during the last year, two have principally engaged attention : the treatment of cancer by regimen, and what is said to be a successful mode of curing cancer, by compression. The recommendation of the plan of compression by Mr. Whitbread, called the attention of the surgeons of the hospital to the subject. The fol- lowing report gives the result of their practice. I have only to observe, that the essential part of this new plan of cure is the compression of the cancer- ous tumor, gently at first, and with a force gra- dually increased, till at last it is augmented to a very great degree : and that the means are theseâ€”if the cancer be open, the various holes and cavities are filled up from the bottom with chalk, finely levigated, and all the surface is thickly covered with hair powder ; over this, long plaster straps are put, so as to cover the whole surface of the tumor, over this again are placed linen com- presses, bound down with the turns of a roller, firmly applied, and of six yards in length ; or over the first straps are laid a second set, bracing the parts more firmly than the first, over this a plate of lead, and lastly, the long roller is carried round the chest, compressing the whole. n 2

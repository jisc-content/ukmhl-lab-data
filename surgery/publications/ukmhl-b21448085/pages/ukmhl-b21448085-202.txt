FRACTURE OF THE SPINE. 15S tentionof the bladder and intestines, are the imme- diate consequences of fracture of the spine. Yet we see here instances of fracture of the entire body of the vertebrae, without such symp- toms as can inform us of the nature of the accident. And in the progress of the case we see symptoms arising, which no one has hitherto pointed out, as proceeding from affection of the spinal marrow. Instead of loss of motion and feeling, you have seen the patient tossing in restless agony; an agony of mind without any definable suffering. Instead of palsy confining his lower extremities, you find him throwing himself suddenly out of bed, and at last rising in a wild delirium, which our observations hitherto would not lead us to expect, as a consequence of that sort of injury which is for the most part attended with loss of sense and motion.. 5. The dissection in those cases proves the nature of this excitement. The great injury done to the spine, to the bone, is followed by inflamma- tion, which is rapidly propagated along the mem- branes of the spinal marrow; and as is the nature of these involving membranes of the nervous matter, when inflamed, suppuration rapidly fol- lows : and in the present example we find the pus dropping out from the sheath when cut across at a part far distant from the fracture. Hence we see the cause of the general irritation, and of the oppression or palsy which follows.

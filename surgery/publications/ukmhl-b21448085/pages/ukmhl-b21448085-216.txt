172 FRACTURE OF THE SPINE. sides the end of each rib, at its junction with the cartilages, stood out distinctly marked and promi- nent. I concluded that the heart must have been bruised, and that he would not recover*. The clavicle of the left side was dislocated from the acromion scapulae ; he had cough, with pain in breathing; he was bled to 16 ounces, and a roller was put round his body, and the shoulders were braced back, by means of the figure of 8 bandage. 6. He passed a restless night. At present his breathing is little disturbed—indeed, he is easy, except when moved. The pulse, which was weak and fluttering last night, is now more steady; the bandage to be removed, and twelve leeches to be applied over the sternum. In the evening he felt so much additional dis- tress, from the absence of the bandage, that it was applied, and with evident relief. 12. This man remains quite free of pain; he has been bled again, but it has been in way of precaution, rather than from the presence of symp- toms. 30. He is quite well, only the ends of the ribs, on the right side, still stand prominent.—There is in a case of this kind no means of reducing the dislocation of the cartilages but by causing the patients to inspire forcibly, and no means of relief but by bleeding and by the application of a roller around the chest. * While sending this to the press, I learn that one of iny pa- tients, whose sternum was fractured, has died, after lingering, with more and more oppression, for five days.

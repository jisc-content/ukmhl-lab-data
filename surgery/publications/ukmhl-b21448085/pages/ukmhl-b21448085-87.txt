CASES OF DISEASED PHARYNX, &c. ,59 On Dissection it was found, that the disease had its seat in the membrane of the pharynx, and from thence had spread to the oesophagus, on one side, and the larynx on the other. Scirrhous tu- mors of great firmness and whiteness, so studded the pharynx and beginning of the oesophagus, as to occupy and nearly close that part of the tube ; one or two smaller white masses further down, betrayed a general disposition of the membrane. Where the membrane was reflected over the glottis into the trachea, it was found much thickened, white, and dense. And on looking through the larynx from below, two white tumors were seen project- ing from the sides of the tube : these left a trian- gular opening so small, that it was wonderful this poor woman could breathe so long. The lym- phatic glands on the side of the throat had par- taken of the disease, and an abscess, with firm scirrhous Avails, had formed in one of the lobes of the thyroid gland. The parts are numbered XIII. 2. M. 13. PREPARATIONS IN THE COLLECTION, Illustrative of the same Subject. In the Collection, XIII. 2. M. distinguishes the specimens of disease in the pharynx and oesophagus. The thirteenth number of the series belongs to the last case.

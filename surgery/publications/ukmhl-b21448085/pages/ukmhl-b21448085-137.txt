CASES OF FISTULA IN PERINEO. 109 lular membrane, when it is permitted to fill the integuments. When in a smaller quantity, and with diminished force, it produces a blush of ery- sipelas, which subsides and rises again in the form of more phlegmonous inflammation. This was particularly the case in two instances, and the fever and the hard swelling of the skin required cold and sedative applications. 5. In most of these cases, the yielding of the urethra was preceded by a state of much excite- ment and irritation. An ulceration of the urethra is^a consequence of this irritation, and the membrane is thereby weakened. The push of urine bursts through this tender part, before there is consolida- tion of the surrounding parts, or before the cells of the common texture are glued together by the process of inflammation. Hence there is no limit to the flow of urine, and hence the dangerous na- ture of the accident : for the general powers of the system quickly sympathize with the death of the part and fall low, and there is a just appre- hension of the patient sinking. 6. The circumstance of irritation preceding the rupture, teaches us to be particularly cautious either of exciting the urethra by interference with instruments, or of permitting a fever to be raised by imprudence on the part of the patient, in a certain state of stricture with irritation. I need not here repeat what may be the dreadful conse- quences. These cases make it too apparent. This view of the subject enjoins another precau-

THIRD REPORT. 70 The Subject continued. Since we have been led to consider the subject of sacs formed in connexion with the pharynx, it is my duty to remind you, that they may be formed in a very different manner from that ex- plained above. We hear of abscesses bursting in- to the throat, and occasioning suffocation; but it is a mistake to suppose that it is the matter which suffocates; it is the irritation of the ulcer, by which the communication is formed with the la- rynx, that causes spasm, and consequent suffoca- tion. When suppurations about the throat open into the pharynx, they also produce great incon- venience and distress. I have already noticed a preparation in my collection, which shows a com- munication betwixt an abscess around the spine and the pharynx. Other scrofulous suppura- tions, may open into the pharynx, and then there is increase of the suffering and danger. I re- member to have seen a remarkable example of abscesses in communication with the pharynx, where I had afterwards an opportunity of examin- ing the parts by dissection. The velum palati adhered to the back of the fauces, and at the same time a hole Avas opened in the palate by ulcera- tion. From the pharynx two holes led into ab- scesses, which had become large sacs reaching by the side of the oesophagus and trachea, and be* twixt the former and the vertebrae of the neck.

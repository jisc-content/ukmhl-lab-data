9 ON CANCER. 2. They are anticipated in the method of curing what is called cancer of the lip. A short statement of the progress of my opinion on this subject, will be the best illustration of the principle. I had seen the excision of a part of a cancerous lip, [or rather, such as was supposed to be cancerous], where a part of the ulcer was necessarily left, it being impracticable to cut away the whole diseased portion ; notwithstanding this, the operation succeeded ; that is to say, the wound united, and the remaining ulcer healed. Reflect- ing on this occurrence, two things seemed evident —1. That the disease which appeared so malig- nant in its aspect, was in reality not cancer, but an ulcer, aggravated by the motion of the lip—2. It was made manifest that the pinning and strapping of the lip after the operation, to keep it still, and procure adhesion, had the further effect of remov- ing the cause of irritation, and healing the remain- ing ulcer. The practice obviously deducible from this rea- soning was, that if by the straps, or what are called the dry suture, we could keep the lip perfectly still, and prevent it from moving in the act of speaking, laughing, swallowing, &c. we should in- fallibly cure malignant ulcers of the lip without excision. This I put in practice with success, twelve years ago, and have since uniformly recom- mended it. 3. Specific action is not subdued by pressure,

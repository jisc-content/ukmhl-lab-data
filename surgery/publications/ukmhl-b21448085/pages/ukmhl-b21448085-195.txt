\5\ FRACTURE OF THE SPINE. PREPARATIONS ILLUSTRATIVE OF THIS SUB- JECT IN THE MUSEUM. \ A pistol ball has passed through the body of one of the vertebrae of the back, and lies press- ing on the sheath of the spinal marrow. A triangular portion of a fractured verte- bra is sunk into the spinal marrow. The vertebra fractured, has united again, and the perfect union shows that the patient must have long survived the accident. Yet he died pa- ralytic of the lower parts of the body, supposed to be in consequence of the pressure of these ine- qualities. The spine fractured, but the spinal marrow not injured. But this appearance is deceitful; for although the spinal marrow was not crushed, it became inflamed, and was the cause of death. The vertebras of the neck having suffered diastasis or subluxation, the intervertebral sub- stance is seen to be wasted in suppuration, and in- flammation being communicated to the spinal mar- row it had extended in the whole length of the sheath. Caries of the vertebra of the back affecting the spinal marrow ; without any token of so for- midable a disease, the man fell down suddenly and expired. Vertebrae and theca laid open, exhibiting a scrofulous tumor similar to what we find in the brain, occupying the spinal marrow.

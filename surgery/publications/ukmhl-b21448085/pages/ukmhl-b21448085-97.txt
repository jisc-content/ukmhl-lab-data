CASES OF DISEASED PHARYNX, &C. 69 man, whose case I have shortly related, was sub- ject to a spasmodic difficulty of swallowing. In that state it often happens that the force of the voluntary muscles remains, while they are unable to overcome the spasm in the top of the oeso- phagus. There are then repeated ineffectual gulping or efforts to swallow, which distend the pharynx; and although by such excitement the muscular fibres acquire strength, yet their strength is like that of the bladder when stimulated by frequent nisus, the fibres form stronger and more distinct fasciculi, betwixt which, the inner mem- brane is permitted to be protruded. When a patient is in the situation of this gen- tleman, the membrane may be protruded either by those ineffectual attempts which are followed by the regurgitation of the morsel; or by that action, which belongs to the complaint, the swallowing of air which is refused passage into the oesophagus, and which occasions a painful distention of the pha- rynx. During such efforts the distending fluid thrust the inner membrane of the pharynx betwixt the fibres or fasciculi of the muscular coat. If a case were to occur in which I had ascer- tained the existence of such a bag before death, I should attempt the cure by syringing the sac with such astringent injection as would prove innox- ious to the stomach if they happened to be swal- lowed, and by feeding the patient through a tube, so as to prevent the distention of the bag.

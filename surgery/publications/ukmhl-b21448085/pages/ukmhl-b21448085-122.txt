FOURTH REPORT. 94 testicles entirely uncovered. Already granulations show themselves. The catheter has been twice withdrawn, and larger ones substituted. This has been an operation of some difficulty, from the length and fulness of the fore skin. But now that the slough can no longer confine the urine the catheter is withdrawn, and he makes urine through the urethra without moistening the dressings be- low ; and the case being much simplified, I have taken my leave. 12th. Friday. The surgeon in attendance has again requested my opinion ; a swelling has taken place round the loAver part of the belly. Above each groin there is an abscess with surrounding hardness. As it is thought possible that the urine has again found its way into the cellular mem- brane, the catheter is introduced ; the integuments of the penis are very much distended ; the glans penis cannot be felt through them, and it is con- sequently difficult to introduce the catheter.â€” P. 115, skin dry; urine high coloured; no appe- tite. Friday 19th. Since my last note a considerable change has taken place. The inflammation ex- tends around the lower part of the belly, forming a band two-hands breadth in diameter. It has been kept low by cold applications, but a band of har- dened integuments incircles the belly, passing from the pubes round both groins and over the alae iliorum. From this date to the 29th there is no note.

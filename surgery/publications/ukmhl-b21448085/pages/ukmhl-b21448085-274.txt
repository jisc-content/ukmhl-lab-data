230 AMPUTATION AT THE SHOULDER JOINT. It may be done, but is not to be depended upon ; for if it be, there will be a great loss of blood. The manner of making the incision has been a great deal too much dwelt upon; for without con- sidering the place and extent of the wound, it is absurd to be critical about the form of the incisions. Generally speaking, the deltoid muscle ought to be made to form the flap ; so as to fall down upon the semicircular incision on the lower or inner part. But the flesh of the top of the shoulder is sometimes torn or contused in such a degree as to make this form of incision impossible. Then two lateral semi- circular flaps are to be formed. But these must still be accommodated to the form of the original wound, and with a regard to the security of the artery. In this operation, the compressing and securing of the artery, is the point by much the most im- portant ; and it is here that I think our military surgeons err: they disregard the danger too much. After experience acquired, they proceed boldly and with effect, without considering the circum- stances of the younger surgeons, or the difficulty as it may present itself to a surgeon on his first opera- tion. But according to the present method, it is not proper to cut the artery across, without se- curity that the blood be arrested ; and on the knife dividing the remaining portion of the limb, and the artery with it, there should not, instead of quietness and security, be a general scatter of the assistants and spectators, to avoid the blood.

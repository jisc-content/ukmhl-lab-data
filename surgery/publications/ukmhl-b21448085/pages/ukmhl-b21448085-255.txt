CASES OF FEMORAL HERNIA. 211 hernia; but is it allowable to do so ? certainly not: for the intestine may be strangulated by the neck of the sac, in which it remains included*. But a second question may be agitated, Is it allowable to reduce the intestine without opening the sac ? that it is possible, this case proves : why it is possible in the femoral hernia, the knowledge of the nature of the sac and of the ligaments, in- forms us : but this also must be a very dangerous operation, and if attempted, no sort of violence must be used. What I have called the outer and false sac of the femoral hernia, is by some authors called a fascia. Let us first endeavour to understand what this is, and then to' give it a name. When in the opera- tion, we have cut through the skin and cellular membrane, and pushed aside the bed of the inguinal glandsf, and raised some loose and fine layers of membranes, we come to a dense coat, which, if we dissect it all around, is like a bottle with a narrow neck, which neck is embraced by the ligamentous arch of the thigh. This is an exact covering to the proper peritoneal sac of equal thickness all around, and the cellular adhesions, both to its out- * This seems at variance with what has been delivered on the delicacy of the proper sac of the femoral hernia ; but while the lower and exposed part of the sac is of extreme tenuity, the neck of the sac is some times firm as a cord. t In cutting down upon the fat of the groin, we in fact cut through the fascia superjicialis, which, however, has its fibres scattered and intermixed with the adipose membrane.

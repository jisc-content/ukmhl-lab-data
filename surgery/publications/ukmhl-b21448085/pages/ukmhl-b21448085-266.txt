In the demonstrations of anatomy which I have given for some years to the students in Windmill Street, I have always shewn that part of the pros- tate, which is called the third lobe ; and in not less than 200 dissections which I have made of the bladder, I have never failed to find the same part, by following the description of the dissection, given in Sir Everard Homeâ€™s book on Diseases of the Prostate. The situation and form of the three distinct portions or lobes of the healthy adult gland are there so accurately described, that were I to describe the parts from the most accurate dis- section, it would appear only as a transcript of the passage.

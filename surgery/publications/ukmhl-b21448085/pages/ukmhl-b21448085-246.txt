202 CASES OF FEMORAL HERNIA; dissection was sufficient.* The gut went up easily; and after it the omentum was reduced. The alarming symptoms in this woman, and which indeed continued, or returned at intervals for three weeks after the operation, were as follows: faintings, languor, vomiting, frequent low delirium, the eye being sunk, and the countenance cada- verous. There was much tension of the abdomen, with a tenderness so great, that she could not bear the touch of the clothes: then came diarrhoea, which threatened to extinguish her remaining powers. From this state of abdominal inflamma- tion, she was saved, as it seemed to me, by cover- ing the whole abdomen with blisters. Blisters, with leeches applied around them, and the warm bath, and opiates, are, in these circumstances, the means most to be relied on. * I have again to observe, that it is the acute angle of inflec- tion made by the gut, more than the narrowness of the stricture, which causes the difficulty of reduction in the femoral hernia. When the operation of cutting the stricture is done to no greater extent than is sufficient to let the flatus of the intestine, or the liquid contents of the intestine be returned into the canal within, there is no danger of cutting any important part. When the neck of the sac is cut, and with it, a quarter of an inch of the acute edge of the ligamentous arch, it will be sufficient; though all this ligamentous part may be safely cut up, to the commence- ment of the Poupart ligament. But there is a manner of doing this operation which is so natural and so safe, that I am sure many must have done it though they have not described it: hav- ing cut a little upward, and that proving insufficient, do not prolong the first incision to a dangerous length, but direct the edge of the knife differently, to the inside or to the outside.

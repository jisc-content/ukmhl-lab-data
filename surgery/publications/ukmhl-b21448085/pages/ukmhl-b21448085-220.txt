176 FRACTURE OF T1IE SPINE. the ribs, the pleura, the lungs, the heart. On dis- section, I found the ribs fractured, and rough with caries, and with irregular projecting points of bone. There was not cause sufficient to account for the fracture of the ribs, but in the first accident: and besides, a surgeon in the country, on first opening the abscess, had declared to the patient, that his ribs were fractured. I have no hesitation in saying, that we have here an example of the formidable consequences of neglected fracture of the ribs. This young man continuing to go about his usual occupations, and work at his trade of a shoemaker, kept the broken ends of the ribs jarring and rubbing against each other. By which continued attrition, an inflam- matory process was kept up, and matter formed around the fractured extremities. This, in process of time, we have seen to have affected the parts both within the chest, and the cellular substance on the outside, subjacent to the pectoral muscles. The cause of the great extent of the suppuration was in the continuance of the irritation. And if it be said that such a consequence would not have arisen, but in a scrofulous patient, I may admit it, and add, do not scrofulous patients break their ribs ? and is it not most necessary, seeing these conse- quences, that the patient be carefully treated and watched in the first two or three weeks, and espe- cially, that the broken extremities of the ribs be kept at rest by the swathing of the chest.

238 AMPUTATION AT THE SHOULDER JOINT. Since the few observations of mine on this sub- ject have stood, as it were, in the way of the reports of the military surgeons, the Baron Larrey is quoted with high consideration. As to the cases of Mr. White and the surgeon of Pezenas, they have no more to do with the question before us, than if it were debated whether those gentlemen used a bistoury in the operation of fistula; and if they be brought forward now with the laudable inten- tion of giving to every one his due, this sort of justice is done with the unfortunate effect of drawing offâ€™ the young military surgeon from the just knowledge of the case, and obscuring his understanding of the question, in practice. In regard to M. Larrey, his cases do not go to the point; and his operations were ill performed. In the cases in which he extracted the head of the humerus, the humerus was broken near the head : a case, I imagine, which would do well, conducted on the principles of gun-shot fractures ; and instead of performing the operation as it sug- gested itself to me, in considering the practice of the British army ; he simply picks away the bones which are loose, without completing the operation; the arm on discovering the state of the bone; and that therefore a flap must be formed ; for the amputation may be done equally well beginning with an incision from the acromion, in the length of the fibres of the deltoid.

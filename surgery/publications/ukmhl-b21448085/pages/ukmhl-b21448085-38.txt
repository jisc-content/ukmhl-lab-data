10 FIRST REPORT. and therefore this method, can not he a cure for cancer. According to my experience, pressure does not subdue specific action. It will diminish the size of tumors: it will produce a wasting even of natural parts ; but that specific action which is the essential character of cancer, and that which is the cause, or which precedes the morbid accretion and growth, will continue under pressure while there is life in the part. This we might expect from the revival of the cancerous action, in cir- cumstances nearly resembling the means now pro- posed to destroy it. When it has been supposed that all the tumor of the cancerous mamma has been extirpated, the cut surfaces brought into contact, strapped and covered with lead to keep them smooth, with compress and bandage over all â€”at the time the natural action of healing prevails, and when the parts are kept at rest and compress- ed, the edges of the incision become tuberculated, * and the cancerous action is propagated, and recom- mences its ravages in the cicatrix. This is a fact familiar to the experience of most surgeons in their early practice, and was one rea- son among many, why I never could allow myself to hope for success from this new mode of com- pression. In point of fact, in no one instance has compression retarded the progress of the disease, nor subdued, even for a time, the specific action of cancer.

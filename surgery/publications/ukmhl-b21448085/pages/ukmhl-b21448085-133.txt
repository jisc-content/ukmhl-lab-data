CASES OF FISTULA IN PERINEO. 105 It was not permitted to open the body, but the bladder was drawn out from the perineum. The bladder was dark coloured, and loaded with blood, as after inflammation. The muscular fibres were uncommonly strong, and the muscles of the ureters very large and distinct. The prostate gland was of a natural size, but the ducts or folicules of the gland were much enlarged, and small abscesses had formed on the outside of the gland in commu- nication with these ducts. The urethra, from within four fingers breadth of the bladder was dilated, but there the probe passed out of the canal into the sloughy integuments ; immediately anterior to this hole there was found a stricture of small extent, but firm as cartilage; and to appear- ance the canal at this place was actually stopped. The kidnies had the pelvis distended. URINARY ABSCESS CONFOUNDED WITH HERNIA, AND THE PATIENT LOST BY DELAY. Tuesday, February 9\st. A professional gentle- man called upon me to beg that I should take un- der my care, a man whom he had just carried to the Hospital, and whom he described as being in eminent danger from strangulated hernia. I found the man so ill as to be nearly incapable of giving me any information. I took this note.

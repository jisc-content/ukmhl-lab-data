CASES OF DISEASES OP THE LARYNX, &C. if and when the child has fallen into this state, giving freedom to the trachea will be of no avail. XI. 1. M. 5. The next example is the larynx of a gentleman who died of Cynanche Lauyn- gea, and on whom the operation of laryngotomy was performed, without giving relief. I did not attend the patient, but received the trachea whilst still fresh. The membrane lining the larynx was swoln and inflamed; the whole membrane, which is now pale and shrivelled, was tumid, so that the sides of the passage were in contact. The friend who gave me the preparation, and who performed the operation, not aware of the rapid course of the disease, permitted it to run too far before he thought himself authorized to operate. The stage of redness of the face, and protuberance of the eyes, and of great struggle and difficulty of breathing, had been succeeded by a pale turges- cence of the face ; a certain degree of insensibility; and the head lay upon the shoulder. The opera- tion was therefore too late; effusion had already taken place in the lungs, and perhaps it may ap- pear in a latter part of this paper, that a different manner of operating from that employed here, viz. thrusting a tube into the larynx, might have had better success in relieving the windpipe.

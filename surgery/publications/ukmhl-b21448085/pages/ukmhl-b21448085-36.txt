8 FIRST REPORT. able : at length, by a lucky accident, he broke his arm, and under the necessary bandaging and confinement of motion, his sinus quickly filled up. Do not therefore be satisfied with pressure, though it be extolled as a sovereign remedy for ulcers : but give rest. Remember how the same ulcer differs on the ancle joint and on the leg : how an ulcer on the lip, or on the tongue, will, by the same cause, (namely, incessant mo- tion) be irritated into the appearance of a malig- nant disease: how an inflammation or abscess about a joint or in the tract of muscles, will be aggravated by motion. Further, your lessons of anatomy teach you, that in order to give rest to a suppuration on the side of the head, the jaw must be kept still : if in the loins, the thigh must be kept still : if on the breast or back, the arm must be kept still. In applying a bandage to an ulcer or sinus, two things are to be attended to, that the diseased parts be supported, and that they have rest. So far as the practice we are examining effects those two purposes, it is beneficial : when carried fur- ther, it is injurious. That it is carried by much too far, I have no hesitation in affirming. In the work which has been recommended by the letter of Mr. Whitbread, the case in which the cure is most satisfactory (indeed, if I recollect, the only instance of cure) is of a cancerous lip. It is easy to prove that.

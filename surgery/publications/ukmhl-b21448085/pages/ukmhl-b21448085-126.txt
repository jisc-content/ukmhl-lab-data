The difference is, that in the one case the membrane of the urethra is torn anterior to the stricture. The urine therefore comes upon it with a diminished stream, after passing through the stricture, and where it has a free passage for- ward. In the other case of rupture by erection the breach is behind the stricture (for there is ever the weakest part of the canal) and the urine flows direct into the breach of the membrane, while the stricture is impeding its progress forward. There is still a more formidable rupture than this into the common cellular membrane, as the following example shows. EXTRAVASATION OF URINE INTO THE CAVERNOUS BODY, FATAL. The body of a man, about fifty, was brought into the dissecting-room. The penis was enorm- ously distended, and black with gangrene, but no breach of surface had taken place. On dissecting the parts a stricture was discovered in the urethra, and a breach in the canal which led into the caver- nous substance of the penis. The urine, instead of infiltrating into the common cellular membrane,

I do not know to what books I can direct you: for authors have treated of the subject very superficially, and we have only some occasional cases in our books. The cases which I have noted for your observa- tion, make it evident that in injuries of the spine the danger to be apprehended is the same with that which accompanies injury to the brain ; viz. the rising of inflammation, and the suppuration within the theca.

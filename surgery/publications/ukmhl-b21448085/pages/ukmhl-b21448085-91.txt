These changes serve to shew you how much of spasm there is in the affection of these parts, even when the disease is of a permanent and unchangeable nature. We are apt sometimes to increase the difficulty of breathing and of swallowing by the very means we take to allay it. I was requested to come down to a surgeon a few miles in the country.

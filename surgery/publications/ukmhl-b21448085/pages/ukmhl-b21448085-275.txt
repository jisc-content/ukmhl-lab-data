AMPUTATION AT THE SHOULDER JOINT. 231 think every practical surgeon must have noticed this fact; that the suddenness with which the blood is drawn from the heart, is of more consequence than the quantity. I have seen in common ampu- tation, a few jets of blood direct from the artery, give a shock to the patient from which he did not recover. The blood which flows from the artery in the shoulder-joint operation, comes direct from the heart; and I have seen the moment of the di- vision, the moment of the general sinking of the patient. In unskilful hands it is fearful to think of the consequence of this state of things. Why, therefore, should not a safer method be taken, if it be as expeditious. I am entitled to speak strongly if I can prove that there is a safer method. It is this : When the incisions have been made above, or on the outer side of the shoul- der ; pierce the capsule, and separate the head of the bone, so that the thumb sinks into the joint; then grasping the integuments of the axilla with the fingers, the artery itself is in your grasp, and not a drop of blood escapes. When the last cut is made, severing the limb from the body, the artery is cut across ; and it is presented with open mouth to the tenaculum or the fingers of the assistant without a drop of blood distilling from it. It is tied with more ease than in a common amputa- tion, and with no occasion for hurry or trepi- dation. In the hospital, called Gendarmerie, at Brussels, T had occasion to perform this operation.

THIRD REPORT, 73 was unable to swallow either solids or fluids, and pointed to the cricoid cartilage as the part where the food stopped ; and he complained of an un- easiness about his stomach, and suffered much from hunger. His tongue was foul, and his bowels constipated. He slept well, notwithstand- ing great weakness. He said that he had been in health till within two months of his coming into the hospital. On a sudden, he found great difficulty in swallowing, and this without any previous pain or difficulty. This obstruction continued for three weeks, and only some days he could swallow thin gruel or beef tea. After this period he was enabled to take his food, and this power of swallowing returned as suddenly as the inability had come upon him. About ten days ago the difficulty of swallowing returned, and now he is again equally incapable of swallowing either solid or liquid food. He never felt pain in the throat. His suffering has been more from hunger than thirst; yet, of late, the craving has diminished. At present what he attempts to swallow is re- turned by vomiting, after remaining in the throat a few seconds. He expectorates a white phlegm, which he complains is of a bitter taste. He has also within these few last days a pain and weight at the scrobiculus cordis. An oesophagus bougie of a common size has been passed into the stomach, without any obstruction being felt.

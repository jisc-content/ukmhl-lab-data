106 FOURTH REPORT. He had a scrotal hernia on the right side, the inte- guments of the scrotum are much tumefied, and have a blush of redness. There is a swelling on the left side of the pubes, the nature of which would be doubtful, from its being in the seat of inguinal hernia, were I not able to trace it down- wards to a connexion with a swelling in the peri- neum. Behind the scrotum there is a tumor which has burst, and in the hole there is a ragged slough of cellular membrane, I got a tolerable answer to questions put to a man whose eye was dead, whose features were sunk, and who was in a sort of drowsy apathy. He had not been troubled with complaint of the bowels, he had had regular eva- cuations, and there was no fulness of belly. He said that he had had no obstruction of urine, but not trusting him in this I used a bougie. I found a stricture very near the orifice, but forcing that I could pass a middle sized bougie into the blad- der. I introduced my bistoury, and enlarged the opening in the perineum, and fomentations were put to the scrotum and perineum, and an anodyne enema given. Wednesday, 22d. This man is with difficulty roused. His breathing is affected, and nothing can save him. He has had a stool, but the nurse cannot assure me that he has passed urine. Eight ounces of urine have been drawn off by the ca- theter: the urine is purulent and very fcetid.â€” Let him have a few spoonfuls of brandy and water.

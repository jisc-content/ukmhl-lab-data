FRACTURE OF THE SPINE. 157 itself, of which they are prolongations. The cases before us afford indeed sufficient evidence on this head. 2. It further appears, to me that the analogy on which this practice is proposed, is false, and that in truth there is no resemblance in the cases. When a portion of the skull is depressed, a comparatively small portion of the brain is injured bv the intru- sion ; and were it possible to take away the part of the brain bruised by the bone, the function of the organ would remain entire. But when a portion of bone has crushed the spinal marrow, the entire diameter of the cord is crushed; and although it be but a small portion which has suffered, the injury of that portion is sufficient to cut off all con- nexion betwixt the parts above and below. 3. Nay, even if it were a sharp spine of fractured bone which had run into the spinal marrow (sup- posing that the injury then produced were suffi- cient to cause palsy of the lower parts of the frame) before that sharp spine of bone could be with- drawn, the circumstances would be so aggravated by the exposure of the spinal marrow, that inflam- mation, suppuration, and death, would be the inevitable consequence. Instead of diminishing the danger, the unhappy fate of the patient would be accelerated. 4. These cases shew how inaccurately the diagnoses of authors have been drawn. What tyro will not readily answer that paraplegia, dis-

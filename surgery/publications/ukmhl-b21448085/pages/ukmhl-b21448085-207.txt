163 AND FRACTURED RIB. liis book of wounds ; such a pupil would have looked with intense interest on the case. I wish that some among you had so attended to the case, I should not then have had to record the following instances : Wednesday, July 6th, 1816. Lynn, acom- mon labourer, was brought to the hospital in a state of insensibility. He had fallen from a scaf- folding ten feet high, into the area below, and his side struck a cross bar of iron. His head was slightly grazed, but there was no other visible in- jury. He was taken up breathless, and apparently dead, and in this state he was brought to the hos- pital. When received, his breathing had been, in a great measure, recovered ; fourteen ounces of blood were taken from his arm; gradually he reco- vered his senses, and as he grew better he became impatient to return to his home. He walked out of the hospital without assistance, and did not seem to suffer from the accident. The house surgeon had wished to detain him, as one or more ribs were fractured ; he applied a roller around his chest, gave him some opening medicines, with in- junctions to return if he found himself worse. On Friday, the 3d day, it was reported that he was worse, having been delirious all night. The dresser went to visit him, he found him labouring- under great difficulty of breathing, and on examin- ing his chest, he felt a slight emphysema extending over the right side. He re-applied the flannel roller, and ordered the medicine to be repeated.

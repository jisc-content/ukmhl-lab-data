CASES OF DISEASES OF THE LARYNX, &C. 39 AN ULCER OF THE THROAT, WHICH OPENED THE Internal dtarotia Artery The last preparation of the series of ulcers of the glottis may be noticed as emphatically closing this account, and sufficiently exposing the danger of disease here. I received this specimen from Mr. Golden of Maidenhead. In the winter, 1S03, a woman, thirty-five years of age, was admitted into the Hospital; she was spitting blood, and coughing in a manner that left no doubt of the case being liemoptoe. She died three hours after being admitted. In dissecting, to display the anatomy of the neck, Mr. Golden discovered that the internal carotid artery communicated with an ulcer of the throat. The preparation exhibits a very deep and ragged ulcer, making an irregular cavity, which communicates with the throat by an opening at the root of the epiglottis, and with the internal carotid artery, at the place it bends in to hide itself by the side of the throat. These facts drawn from morbid anatomy, and these cases, will perhaps lead my reader to con- clude with me, that venereal ulceration of the larynx is a more frequent and alarming symptom

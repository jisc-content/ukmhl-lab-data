FRACTURE OF THE SPINE. 1?5 found adhering to the inside of the ribs; they were firm, being consolidated by inflammation, and by â–  this means the cavity of the chest was diminished, and consequently the diaphragm drawn up. The lungs were seen adhering to the pericardium, and that sac itself was inflamed and thickened, and distended with a purulent serum. The surface of the heart itself was rough with coagulablelymph and pus. And now it was found that the lungs of the right side contained a large abscess, which wasincon- nexion with the communication betwixt the carious ribs, and it proved to have been from this abscess that the copious discharge of matter had flowed out in the dressing of the outward wound. With this abscess in the lungs, the cavity of the pericardium communicated, by means of an ulcerated hole in that membrane. The lungs of the left side, and what remained of the lungs of the right side, ex- ternal to the line of adhesion, caused by the irrita- tion of the carious ribs, were free from all disease. Remarks on the preceding Case. Some were of opinion that the ribs had not been fractured in this case ; but that the part in contact with the ribs having been bruised,suppurated; that the matter lying in contact with the bones, had made them carious. But, without entering into the ques- tion, whether or not the contact of matter will pro- duce such an effect on the surface of bone, I am of opinion that pus formed by a bruise in the side would not thus propagate itself in succession to

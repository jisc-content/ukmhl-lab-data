A Report on Cancer is offered in the Com- mencement of this work as a pledge for the fulfil- ment of one of the objects which I had in view in undertaking it, which was to give the history of this disease and of those which most resemble it. It is a field hitherto so little cultivated, or so barren of improvement, that it requires a pledge to pre- vent the relinquishment of so painful a subject. But were there no hope of improving our practice in this disease, it is still a duty, especially incum- bent on a Surgeon of the Middlesex Hospital, to turn others from the errors which he may himself have committed, and to shew, by his experience, what is injurious or unprofitable.

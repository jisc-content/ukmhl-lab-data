FOURTH REPORT. 118 Eight o’clock in the evening. He is not only feverish, but is excessively anxious and perturbed in his mind, and his countenance declares his long suffering. It is a state which must not be long permitted to continue. He has been in great pain, and the bladder is felt above the pubes. He has not passed urine since my visit. He expe- riences a burning sensation in the tumor of the perineum, and the scrotum is slightly swollen, I suspect with urine. A purging draught has had no effect on the bladder, and an opiate clyster has given him no relief. Contemplating these circum- stances there was but one thing to be done. I introduced a metallic bougie down to the stricture. I then took a sharp and narrow bistoury, and pass- ing it into the base of the tumor I directed its point towards the end of the bougie. I then drew the bistoury so as to lay open the tumor—a quan- tity of foetid pus burst out to some distance on introducing the bistoury, and by-and-bye the urine ^dropt freely through the incision. This so effec- tually relieved the urethra of pressure, that the patient was in a short time able to pass a few ounces of urine by the natural passage. On the succeeding day the belly was soft; the bladder was still to be felt, but the feverishness had diminished. I was prepared to puncture the bladder, if this amendment had not been evident. He escaped on this occasion ; the swelling sub- sided ; the urine became more free, and only a small fistulous opening remained in the perineum,

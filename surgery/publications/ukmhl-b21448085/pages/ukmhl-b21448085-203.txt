FRACTURE OF THE SPINE. 159 The inflammation of the spinal marrow i3 attended with an almost universal nervous irrita- tion, which is presently followed by excitement of the brain ; in the mean time, matter is poured out into the sheath of the spinal marrow, and either by its pressure causing palsy, or by its irritation disturb- ing the function of the part, so as to be attended with the same consequences. The excitement of the brain being followed by effusion death ensues. 6. There remains a question of some moment, and on which, in discussion with my learned brethren of the profession, I do not mean my brethren of the hospital, I have had the misfortune to disagree. A man who receives an injury of the spine recovers from the immediate effects of the accident, but at the distance of months, instead of having the full use of the lower extremities re- stored, lie begins to drag them more and more, and at length becomes totally palsied in the lower extremities, and languishes, and dies. I have heard it proposed by very high profes- sional authority, to cut down upon the spine and apply the trephine and raise the bone. This ap- pears to me a most desperate measure. In the first place, it is not proved that it is the bone which presses the spinal marrow. Indeed, I am confident, that in these protracted cases, when the palsy increases slowly, it is the thicken- ing of the membrane which encroaches on the spinal marrow; or a diseased action which is

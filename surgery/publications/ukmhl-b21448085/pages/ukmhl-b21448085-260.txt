216 CASES OF FEMORAL HERNIA. ture be free to allow the faeces to pass, and if he can pass in the tip of his little finger, no further operation is necessary. But if the contents of the intestine be not freely discharged, and if the gut have come through a space so small as to impede the discharge, then the ligament is to be cut. But this ought not to be done by introducing the bistoury on the finger which is within the gut; for then the sound part of the gut is cut, and the abdominal cavity may be opened, which, in this state of parts, is happily closed. The parts must be dissected around the ring or neck of the sac; the edge of the ligament is to be raised without injuring the intestine, and the firm or ligamentous parts only cut; and I have already said, very little cutting will enable the surgeon to pass the finger up the gut, and through the ring or stricture. I have in this Report given ten cases of femoral hernia, and I have seen many without keeping any account of them, and many in which I saw only the fatal result on dissection. But the question which has been so much agitated about the manner of cutting and sewing the mortified in- testine, has never occurred to me in a practical form, unless the first case of this series might be so construed. When there was mortification, there were also adhesions of the gut to the ring and mouth of the sac. That adhesion is not to be un- done for the purpose of tying or sewing the sides of the gut together! Here experiments on brutes are

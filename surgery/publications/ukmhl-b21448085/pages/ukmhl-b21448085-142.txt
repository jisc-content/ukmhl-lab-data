FOURTH REPORT. 114 to form a succession of abscesses around the root of the penis. There was no communication be-* twixt the urethra and these abscesses. A Third Example.â€”Of Abscess from the Use of the Bougie. At the.breaking out of the war with the United States, I had under my care an American gentle- man, who, in his desire to get home, used the bougie too frequently, and without allowing the excitement of the parts after the introduction of the instrument to subside, before he passed it again. In consequence of this I found him complaining of heat, throbbing and swelling,in the perineum ; and on examination a hardness was perceptible in the perineum. This hardness increased, and was pro- longed towards the anus. The skin caked; I could not resolve the swelling; it became red and sup- purated. But the canal being sufficiently pervious, by making him live very low and quietly, by soothing the part, and by giving mucilaginous drinks, and deferring the use of the bougie, it closed and healed. I might give many other instances of the same occurrence, were it not against the plan of this work to refer to cases of which I have no longer any record, either in notes or in anatomical preparations. A suppuration will take place at the inner corner of the eye, bearing the same relation to the lacry- mal duct that these have to the urinary passage,

CASES OF FISTULA IN PERINEO. 117 STRICTURE, WITH in ttjc Umitcunt. the PATIENT IN THE FIRST INSTANCE SAVED; BUT ON A RETURN WORN OUT WITH IRRITATION. Pool, a servant of Sir J. St. A. aged 50, â€¢has been taken into the Hospital. I attended him formerly in the following circumstances. He had been subject to strictures in the urethra for many years, and by the kindness of his master he had been placed under the care of more than one surgeon ; the caustic had been applied several times. The occasion of my seeing him was this. In coming up from Brighton he was exposed to fatigue and cold, and hence came a frequent call to make water and a great difficulty in passing it, which was followed by a complete strangury. He told me he had been subject to ague, and that this attack had been preceded with cold shiver- ing. One o'clock. There is a tumor in the perineum, and a little oozing of matter from the urethra ; his pulse is full and strong, the belly is distended, and the bladder can be felt above the pubes. I intro- duced the smallest bougie into the stricture, but it did not reach the bladder ; while I withdrew it, I urged him to try again to make water. He was enabled to pass eight ounces of urine. Leeches were then applied to the perineum, after which he was ordered into the hip bath.

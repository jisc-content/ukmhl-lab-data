CASES OF DISEASED PHARYNX, &C. 71 Here the mechanical operation of these sacs and their valvular openings into the pharynx, had even a more unfavourable effect than in the examples mentioned above; for whilst the food could not reach the stomach it fell into the sacs and increas- ed the inflammation. In this case, the attempts to relieve were made too late, and the miserable patient died of irritation and inanition. The cure in such cases might be conducted as hinted above, with the addition of opening the abscesses externally, so that no lodgment might be permitted in them. It must be admitted, however, that the difficulty and danger of the case is such as to make it very desirable to prevent abscesses from forming in communication with the throat, either by inflammation of the membrane produc- ing them, or by suppurations bursting into the tube. I cannot conclude this subject without leading the pupil to remark, that there is something in common to all the tubes of the body; in as far as irritation within them will produce abscess on their sides, and sometimes these abscesses will commu- nicate with the tube affording an additional source of irritation and mischief. Thus from inflamma- tion in the fauces we have abscess in the folds of the arches of the palate, and behind the amyg- dalae ; from inflammation of the pharynx we have abscess external to the bag. So have we ab- scesses around the larynx and in the thyroid gland, produced by irritation and inflammation in' the

FIRST REPORT. 12 It cannot therefore have been surprising to you, that this woman and many others, on whom the bandage has been firmly applied, have thrown their trappings off as an insufferable load. 6.

By a great degree of pressure upon the large scirrhous mamma, a very rapid change is produced upon the bulk of the tumor. But the absorption is principally of the interstitial fluids and sur- rounding fat, and a condensation of the cellular membrane takes place. By this wasting and com- pression of the subjacent cellular substance and fat, the mass of disease is brought nearer to the muscles and ribs, and adhesion of the tumor to the ribs is the consequence. It has been stated that compression loosens the tumor, but in one instance the application of the straps and bandage had the effect of fixing the tumor of the breast in the proportion of its diminution. Certainly in that case the disease is now incorporated with the ribs, and effusion into the cavity of the chest must soon take place. The late Dr. Denman greatly improved his de- partment of practice, and was justly esteemed in the first rank for independence and knowledge, as well as beloved for his many virtues. He fell into the belief that pressure would prove a remedy for cancer, and lent the influence of his name to re-

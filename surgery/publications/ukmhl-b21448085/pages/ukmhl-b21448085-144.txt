FOURTH REPORT. 116 gum catheter, and let it remain in the bladder ; by this the urine was drawn off without falling into the abscess, and he was easy for two or three days. On visiting him at the end of this time I found him complaining, as formerly, of pains and con- tractions, and a burning sensation when the urine passed. This was explained by discovering that the urine passed by the side of the catheter as well as through it. Upon withdrawing this catheter, and introducing one a size larger, this symptom disappeared. The swelling subsided, the inflam- mation and pain in the perineum was removed, and he appeared quite well, having the additional sa- tisfaction of seeing an unusually large instrument pass easily into his bladder. About three weeks after this, having made pre- parations for his journey, and having dined with a friend in a coffee room to be ready for the mail, he rose to make water, and suddenly he felt his old symptom, an acute burning pain in the perineum. He was aware of what had taken place, and re- turned to his lodgings, and sent for me. We repeated the means formerly employed, but without all the same good effect ; an abscess form- ed,which burst and discharged a feiv drops of urine, and became a fistula. ByÂ®the use of the gum catheter, and afterwards by the use of the bougie occasionally, this fistulous abscess diminished and closed; and at length the patient got into the country.

232 AMPUTATION AT THE SHOULDER JOINT* ket ball had struck the head of the humerus, and fractured it, and broken up the acromion scapulae. Whether this was a proper case for the operation of amputation, we shall presently inquire : but I was employed in disengaging the broken bones when two staff surgeons came in, who induced me to convert the ugly wound which they saw, into an amputation at the joint. The state of the pa- tient admitted of no delay ; and, taking the am- putation knife, with three motions of the knife I separated the arm. I stood behind the patient. Setting on the knife in the wound of the top of the shoulder, I drew it so as to make a flap of the outside of the deltoid. Then laying the wounds into one, (in the direction of the dotted line, Plate VI,) I drew the knife a second time in the cut, so as to open the capsule. I then passed the thumb of my left hand into the joint, betwixt the glenoid cavity and the head of the humerus, bending the fingers of the same hand into the axilla, I held the string of the artery and nerves firmly betwixt my fingers and thumb, and completed the opera- tion by a semicircular sweep of the knife on the inside and lower part of the arm. The artery pre- sented its empty mouth. Giving up the knife, I took hold of the artery with my finger and thumb of the right hand, and drew it out clear of the nerves ; when it was tied by my assistant. In this manner of operating, the only thing that can be called a difficulty, is common to both me- thods of operatingâ€”the division of the capsule.

When at last the slight incumbrance was overcome, the barrow went suddenly from under him, and he fell with his chin upon the curb stone : he was instantly motionless, and although it was only a few yards to the hospital, when brought in, he was quite dead. Upon dissection it was found, that the tooth-like process of the second verte- bra, which threads the ring of the atlas, had broken from the hold of its ligaments; and, the transverse ligament yielding, the process had crushed the medulla oblongata. Under the head of Counterfissure, in the First Report on Fracture of the Skull, another example of sudden death from injury to the medulla oblon- gata will be found. This sudden death will remind you of the dif- ferent effects of an injury to the spine, according as it is higher or lower on the column. When the fracture is low it is attended with loss of sensi- bility. and motion in the lower extremities and disorder of the bladder; when the injury is higher up the abdomen suffers more distention; still higher, the respiration is affected; and when the fracture is above, the principal origin of the phrenic nerve, the act of respiration is stopt, and death from suffocation suddenly follows.

CASES OP FEMORAL HERNIA. 187 symptoms, so we find that when the vomiting is free, and the discharge by this means copious, the other symptoms are in a less alarming degree, of which the following case is an example. II. CASE OF FEMORAL HERNIA IN A MA# RENDERED OBSCURE BY AN INGUINAL HERNIA, AND THE PATIENT LOST BY THE UNIMPRESSIVE CHARACTER OF THE SYMl'*1 TOMS. A gentleman 63 years of age, and living at the time thirty miles out of London, perceived a small tumour in his groin. This swelling coming in circumstances which, to his confused notions, gave him the idea of its being a venereal bubo, although he had pain and vomiting from the com- mencement, he threw himself into a mail-coach, and came to town. This gentleman first felt the tumour on Saturday morning, he came to town on Sunday, and I was called into consultation on Monday, after my lecture ; I found him sitting in his parlour, drinking a large basin of tea; and as he was receiving his friends, I heard them com- pliment him upon his good looks. There was, to my observation, an unnatural excitement about him. He was animated and restless. I saw him vomit the tea which he had beeh drinking, and the vomiting Was easy, and without distress, or such exertion of retching as accompanies a com- mon fit of sickness. o 2

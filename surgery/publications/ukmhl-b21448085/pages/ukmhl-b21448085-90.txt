62 THIRD REPORT. here the spasms of the glottis, and the impediment to respiration. It is a disease to which the glandular structure of the tube exposes it, and, as the glandular struc- ture prevails most at the extremities of the canal, and as both the pharynx and rectum are more subject to injury than the other portions of the tube, so this disease most frequently occurs in those parts. The scirrhous thickening of the coats of the pharynx produces so great a change, that they become incapable either of contraction or of re- laxation. Although there be no stricture of the tube, it becomes incapable of transmitting the food into the stomach. In such a case as that, XIII. 2. M. 9. where the scirrhous ulceration has made the oesophagus much more capacious than natural, yet the continuity of the muscular action, by which the food is transmitted to the stomach, is interrupted, and a disease very different from stricture resembles it in the most essential circum- stanceâ€”the incapacity of swallowing. The scirrhous thickening of the pharynx or oesophagus, may certainly be much relieved by the use of the bougie, and frequent application of leeches to the side of the throat. The issue in the sides of the throat, and the bougies, will effect a cure where there is a mere thickening by com- mon inflammation or scrofulous action. But where the disease, as in Nichols, is of a cancerous dis- position, the relief must be very transitory. You will not have failed to remark, that al- though the issues gave much relief in the end, yet

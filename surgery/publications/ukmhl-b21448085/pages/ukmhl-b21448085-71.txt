CASES OF DISEASES OF THE LARYNX, &C. 43 young man made six cuts on the fore part of the larynx: so many notches are seen upon the car- tilages. The arteries have been injected, and all the branches are entire ; notwithstanding that none even of the considerable branches of the thy- roid artery are cut, yet he bled in secret for three hours and died of hcemorrhage. There are two things in this case worthy of no- tice. 1. It ought to be recollected that in all ope- rations of the fore part of the neck, the thyroid gland ought to be avoided ; for such is the activity of its vessels, that when touched with the knife it bleeds with surprising activity. 2. In the next place, surgeons, and I believe many anatomists also, are ignorant of the superior lobe of the thyroid gland. This lobe certainly is not always to be met with, but it exists so frequently as to make it an object, in operation. This lobe is at- tached to the anterior and lateral part of the gland, and stretches upwards on the side and fore part of the cyrcoid cartilage. It was this part of the thy- roid gland which was cut and notched in this in- stance, and from it this great quantity of blood flowed. Since I have been drawn to mention this lobe of the thyroid gland, I may take notice that there is a muscle (which I believe is not described) to be met with here. It descends from the os hyoides, and expands upon the great lobe of the thyroid gland. I have a preparation before me, which by the

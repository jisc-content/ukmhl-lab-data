AMPUTATION AT THE SHOULDER JOINT. 229 I shall confine myself at present to those wounds of the shoulder, which require extraction of the head of the bone, or amputation at the socket. If the surgeon and his assistant be bold and dex- terous, and use dispatch, the operation oe am- putation at the shoulder joint, may be safely performed according to the present method. I saw it done in Haslar hospital, in a manner which left no room for improvement, while com- mitted to such hands. But considering it as an operation often required, and of course, pretty ge- nerally performed, it does seem to me, that a plainer and safer mode ought to be laid down. These are subjects which it is dangerous to consi- der theoretically. Experience leads us to a fuller comprehension of the difficulties ; and sometimes, contrary to the general course, the hand leads the head : for, in performance, that is often difficult or awkward, which is plain in words, or easy to be done, though obscure in description. In my volume of Surgery, I have explained the necessity of supporting the patient, and the manner of doing it. I there stated, that if the patient be not supported at the moment of dividing the artery, when the pressure should be greatest and the re- sistance most steady, the patient sinks, and the artery is free ! I have additional reasons to caution the surgeon against this occurrence. The compressing of the artery above the clavicle, does not secure the patient against loss ot blood.

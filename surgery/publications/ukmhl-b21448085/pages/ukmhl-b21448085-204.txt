FRACTURE OF THE SPINE. 160 gradually more and more affecting the nervous matter itself. It may be said, that although the pressure is produced by the thickened envelope of the spinal marrow, still it is the confinement of the bone which causes the membranes to press in upon the spinal marrow ; and if, by taking away the part of the tube of bone which confines the membranes, freedom were given to them, the spinal marrow would be freed from pressure. But this is an idea too mechanical. On the other hand, 1 offer this view: the palsy is a consequence of the swelling of the membranes, and proceeds from inflammation; and if you cut down upon the bone, and saw it out, and expose these membranes, you will not only increase the swelling and thickening of the involving membranes, but you will most probably raise such direct inflammation and mischief, as to cut off the patient suddenly. What then are we to do nothing in these des- perate circumstances? I do conceive the case to be desperate; but that does not authorise us to attempt a remedy which is not only desperate, but which will not stand examination, and affords to me, I confess, no hope. We are to take up the case as a scrofulous inflammation of the spine, and I am certain, that much may be done by prosecut- ing the cure with energy and perseverance, by local bleeding and deep issues.

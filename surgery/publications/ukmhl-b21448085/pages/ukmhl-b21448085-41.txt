But you have seen two cases of that disease in which pres- sure aggravated the pain, and had no power in subduing the tumor. 7. The idea is not new. And now it only remains for me to state, that the idea of destroying by pressure, dangerous tu- mors, which could not be extirpated with the knife, is familiar to me from my first entering upon the study of our profession. Mr. John Bell had an opinion, that it was possible to suffocate and subdue the action of vessels in tumors by the com- press and bandage. This he was wont to illustrate by the effect of that bandaging of the limbs, by which mendicants reduce the substance of their limbs to a third part of their natural bulk; by the example of the feet of the women of China, and other ingenious analogies. He argued, that if the natural structure of the body could be moulded by pressure, why should not these formidable tu- mors ? When tumors have been of the nature of aneu- rism or varicose enlargement of vessels, I have seen advantage from the application of the roller and cold solution, but I have never seen any oc- currence now or formerly, to encourage the hope of curing cancer by pressure.

185 CASES OF FEMORAL HERNIA^ which the stricture embraced the intestine was not so great as to stop the circulation of the blood in the vessels of the intestine. The intestine, therefore, remained alive, and in no danger of strangulation, while it remained empty. 3. The vessels, however, continuing to secrete into the cavity of the intestine, such an accumulation of mucus was at last produced, that the portion of the intestine became fully distended, and then there was imminent danger of strangulation. 4. As the included portion of the intestine became filled, the angle of reflection formed over the sharp edge of the stricture, increasing every hour, the coats became so tightly drawn against the edge of the stricture, that they wrere first gorged with stagnant blood, and, finally, the circulation was stopped. Strangulation then took place, and mortification, or the ulceration of the intestine by pressure against the tendon. Thus we may see how an intestine strangulates itself; how it fills by its own secretions, until an effect is produced equal to the binding of the stricture, although the tendon be passive, and of a nature not liable to change. The stricture ope- rates in retarding the free return of the blood by the veins of the intestine, and the consequence i9 not only a distention of the intestine with secreted fluid, but an infiltration into the coats of the in- testine, which produces a thickness in them, and a sensation to the feeling of fleshiness in singular contrast with that part of the gut em- VOL.

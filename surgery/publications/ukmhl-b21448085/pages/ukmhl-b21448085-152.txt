FOURTH REPORT. 124 9th. I experienced great difficulty in attempt- ing to pass a small silver catheter into the bladder, and desisted ; taking then a large soft bougie, to ascertain the state of the canal, I found it, unex- pectedly, and without using force, pass out at the wound. 11th. A catheter has been passed into the bladder. 25th. The catheter has been retained till this day; the urine came freely through it, and also by the side of it. No urine has come by the wound, and the swelling and redness of the peri- neum is rapidly diminishing. A larger catheter introduced. 27th. The scrotum is large, but this comes from a swelling of the testicle, not from extrava- sation nor inflammation of the perineum. April \0th. The passage was made perfectly free by the use of the silver catheter, for catheters successively of a larger size were introduced ; but his health did not improve. His evening fever continued, his pulse was always quick, he had no appetite. He had a cough, with purulent expec- toration. He was wasting. A natural question occurredâ€”Could the presence of the instrument occasion or assist in keeping up the irritation ? Accordingly, for some days, the catheter has been withdrawn, and only a soft bougie passed into the bladder, very gently, twice a week. But the symptoms have not mended.

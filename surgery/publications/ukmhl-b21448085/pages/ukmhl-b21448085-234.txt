See p. 111.—In visit- ing this patient, he tells me his rupture has come down, and that he cannot return it. I find a small soft tumour in the left groin, with a neck com- ing from under Poupart’s ligament. I have not been able to reduce it. I have made the patient continue to press his hand gently against it. He is ordered to be bled, and put into the warm bath, and then the house surgeon is ordered to try gentle and long continued pressure on the hernia. In the evening it was announced to me that the hernia was strangulated, and the patient very ill, I found him in great pain, but without much ten- sion pf belly ; no hiccough, no vomiting, but only pain in the belly. I madp an effort to com- press and reduce the tumour, but did not succeed. P«arge clysters had been repeatedly administered. Aware of his danger, yet considering the short time the tumour had been down, its softness, and the absence of tension and sickness, I thought it bet- ter to let him lie for the night. R. 01.

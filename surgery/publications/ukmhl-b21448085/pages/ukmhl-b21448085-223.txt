CASES OF FEMORAL HERNIA. 179 since unsuccessfully endeavoured to illustrate, by experiments on brutes. In vain I had endeavoured to noose the intestine of dogs and cats, and pro- duce upon them the effects of strangulation. When the intestine was surrounded with a cord, the cord was in a few days carried within the in- testine, and when the noose of string was made to embrace a turn of the intestine, instead of produc- ing turgescence and strangulation, it was found to c,ut the coats; and, as the cord cut its way into the intestine, a new membrane covered it so that there was no breach in the intestine, and the alimentary matter, continued to be carried in its course, these cruelties were therefore of no avail.* The futility of experiments on animals, when brought in illustration of the morbid changes of the human body, makes even a single fact observed in practice valuable; and I am well convinced by many failures, as well as by what I have observed in my friends, that it is in vain, by experiment on brutes, to anticipate the years of practice and actual observation. We may consider the intestine, in a hernia, as subject to four different conditions: I. It lies in the sac, its function continues, and there is no impediment to the alimentary matter: 2. It is in- cluded in the sac, and retained by adhesion ; but it performs its function without interruption: 3.

113 CASES OF FISTULA IN PERINEO. \Vish were more generally known than I find it to be) that a very little pressure of a bougie more than is right, into a narrow stricture will bring on irritation in the canal; and that the effect of that irritation within the canal will be a suppuration or abscess on the outside of it. The cellular membrane is so much more prone to fall into suppuration than the part primarily affected, that matter is collected ex- ternal to the urethra, and without any direct com- munication with that tube. It will no doubt also be observed, that the cir- cumstances of the case required rest and forbear- ance, and that the cause of irritation being re- moved, the abscess closed. If the bougie had been persevered in, urine would soon have appeared in the abscess ; that is, the urethra would have be- come ulcerated, and then a fistula would have formed. Another Example.—Stricture of the Orifice of the Urethra, producing Abscesses of the Pubes. There is no kind of stricture which is attended with more distress and spasm, and the consequent irritation, than the verv narrow stricture situate immediately within the orifice of the urethra. The first specimen of stricture of the urethra pre- served in that division of my collection which contains the morbid appearances of the urinary organs, is of one just within the orifice of the urethra, and which with difficulty admits a bristle. In this case the effect of irritation in the canal was VOL. I.—PT. I. I

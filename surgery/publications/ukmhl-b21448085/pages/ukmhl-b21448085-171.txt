EXPLANATION OF TOE PLATES. FIGURE 2, PLATE IV. In the First Number. This Figure represents the Prostate Gland, with Part of the Bladder seen from within. A. A. Openings of the Ureters. B. Muscles of the Ureters, very strong-. C. Insertion of the Muscles of the Ureters into the Prostate, the Part into which they are inserted forms a projecting Tumour, hitherto considered to be the third Lobe. D. Op ening of the Urethra closed by the projecting Portion of the Gland. E. Part of the Coat of the Bladder thrown down on the Prostate. F. Prostate slightly enlarged. G. Beginning of the Membranous Part of the Urethra. The back View of the Prostate is not given, but in the Preparation the Portion called Third Lobe, may be seen projecting down- ward, and distinct from the Valvular Tumour, commencing at C. PLATE V. This Plate illustrates the Dissertation on the Ligature of Arteries. Fig. 1. The Femoral Artery dissected from the Stump, after Am- putation. A. A very small Clot. B. A considerable Branch going off very near the Place of the Ligature, and which, by bringing down the Stream of Blood, has prevented the Formation of the Clot. We see here by what a precarious Tenure the Secondary Haemorrhage is restrained. Such a Circumstance has produced fatal, because unexpected and sudden, Haemorrhage. Fig. 2. Represents the Effects of an Experimentâ€”A Ligature was thrown loosely around the Carotid Artery of an Ass; the Effect was to intercept the Course of the Blood. A. The Ligature encircling the Artery, but not drawn; but only in Contact with the Outer Coat. B. B. The Clot formed as a Consequence of the Ligature as a foreign Body irritating the Artery. Fig. 3. The Artery of a Stump. A. The Clot. B. The Hole from which the Ligature was withdrawn. This Preparation shows, that in a healthy Stump the End of the Artery below the Ligature remains; that the Ligature comes away without bringing a Portion of the Coats with it.

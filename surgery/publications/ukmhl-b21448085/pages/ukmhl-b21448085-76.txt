SECOND REPORT. 48 owing to the difficult respiration, that they bleed very freely. The bleeding makes the operation bustling instead of being done quietly ; and there is considerable danger in opening the trachea while the bleeding continues, lest it fall into the trachea, and with the accumulated mucus suffocate the patient. I have objections to cutting out a portion of the cartilage, because it commits more injury to the parts than appears to me necessary, and be- cause it makes a hole which it requires a process of granulation to fill up, and especially, because it affords a greater facility for the granulations to project into the larynx, and to obstruct the canal. Anatomy and experiment give us very distinctly the great principle to be attended to in these dis- eases of the larynx. All obstructions have a spas- modic character; coming in paroxysms, whether the cause be irritation or mechanical pressure. An aneurism of the carotid, or a disease of the thyroid gland, or a foreign body sticking in the pharynx or larynx, is attended with a difficulty of breathing, which returns after intervals of ease, betraying its source to be an excited muscular ac- tion, a contraction of the muscles of the arytenoid cartilages. These muscles, by their operation on the chordce vocales, close the rima glottidis, and impede the issue of the air. By the operation of laryngotomy, or tracheotomy, the air gets free passage, but the mischief remains: the acute and

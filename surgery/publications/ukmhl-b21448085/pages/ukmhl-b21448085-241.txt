CASES OE FEMORAL HERNIA. 197 from the sudden angle which the included intes- tine forms. And that when this has taken place the danger is imminent from a cause not hitherto noticed, viz. the secretion of the intestine itself. From the cause of strangulation, being in the secretion of the intestine two consequences are ap- parent, viz. the greater danger attending small her- nia, and the necessary increase of the danger as time elapses. While we are left to suppose that the intes- tine is merely full of faeces, which neither admits of increase nor diminution, we might be inclined to temporise; but if we understand that when a small portion of intestine is retained in a stricture, that it is filling by its own secretion, we see a fur- ther motive to early operation. The next point which I have ventured to urge, is the danger of the rule to wait for symptoms. It has been my purpose to show that the symptoms have no correct bearing to the urgency of the case, and that they do not proceed from the state of the strangulated intestine, but from the general distention and excitement of the canal above the strangulated portion. Tormina-sickness and vomit- ing, and tension of the belly, even the character of the countenance, and the frequency and feebleness of the pulse, depend on the state of the bowels gene- rally, and we find them in excess, while yet the intestine in the sac is natural; on the other hand, we find the whole of these symptoms but little urgent, when the intestine is fast approaching to gangrene. To wait for symptoms is therefore to

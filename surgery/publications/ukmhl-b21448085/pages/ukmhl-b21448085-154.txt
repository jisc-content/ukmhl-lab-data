FOURTH REPORT. 126 about twenty years ago, he had discharge from the urethra, attended with phymosis, so troublesome, that it was necessary to divide the foreskin. For some years after this, he describes himself to have been in health, but he was at sea, and lived a sailor’s life for four years. About this time he be- came subject to obstruction in the urethra, and the difficulty was so great, that he would continue to make ineffectual efforts for twenty-four hours together, before he could pass a drop of urine. For four years he was subject to this distress. It was at this time that he fell from the ship’s side, - and received a violent contusion of his loins, on account of which he was carried to the hospital ship at Sheerness. Here, experiencing some of his old symptoms, with obstruction of urine, the sur- geon attending was led to examine his urethra with a bougie. But he never succeeded in pass- ing the instrument into the bladder. Notwith- standing this, the patient experienced considerable relief, and made water more freely. He was dis- charged from the hospital ship, but ever after at- tributed the discharge from the urethra to the ope- rations he underwent while there. About ten years ago he was taken prisoner, and remained in Valenciennes until the peace. Three years after his confinement he experienced an in- creasing difficulty in making water, and had more frequent calls. He was attacked with fever, ushered in with cold shivering, and followed by inflammation and swelling in the perineum.

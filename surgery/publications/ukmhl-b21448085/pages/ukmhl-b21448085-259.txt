There was a little coagulated blood at the neck of the sac, and a small nick visible from the abdomen, where the bistoury had passed in the second ope- ration. Observations on the Case. Authors, in treating of the barsten intestine, should have distinguished two cases; the intestine burst by ulceration on the sharp ligament, and the intestine burst after mortification.

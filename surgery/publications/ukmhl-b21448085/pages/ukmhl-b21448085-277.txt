In the common manner of amputating, the artery being cut across, shrinks, but the gush of blood does not cease; it still is- sues from the retracted arterv, and obscures its place. A great advantage of this manner which I recommend is, that the artery is so held that it cannot retract, but points towards you with open mouth. Now I ask with confidence, Is not this a safer, and therefore a better method, than trusting entirely to the compression of the subclavian artery ?

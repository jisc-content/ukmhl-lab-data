SECOND REPORT. 20 lymph passed across the part; a bony portion of the thyroid cartilage was necrosed, and hung loose in the remains of what had been the sacculus laryn- gis, and such accretion of coagulable lymph had taken place, that the passage of the larynx was near- ly closed. Marks of chronic inflammation were upon the inside of the trachea; the lungs did not collapse when the chest was open : when their substance was cut into, much frothy mucus es- caped, and the fluid continued a long time to flow from the bronchi. Some tubercles were distin- guishable in the lungs, and the pericardium con- tained water. XI. 1. M. 17. This preparation exhibits an ulcer in the sacculus laryngis, very much resem- bling the former. The patient was worn out by a purulent cough. XI. 1. M. 18. An ulcer of the sacculus laryn- gis, which has eat deep with a sharp defined edge. It is like a venereal ulcer. XI. 1. M. 19. An ulcer of the glottis, sup- posed to be venereal. The circumstances of the case are very interesting. See p. 32. XI. 1. M. 10. Ulcer in the glottis, and ab- scesses around the thyroid cartilage. Laryngo- tomy was performed betwixt the thyroid and cri- coid cartilages. â€¢

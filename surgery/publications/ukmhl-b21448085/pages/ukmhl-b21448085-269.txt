STRUCTURE OF THE PROSTATE CL AND. 225 ureters are not inserted into the third lobe, but into that part of the prostate which, when diseased, pro- jects into the bladder. In the works of some of the best anatomists, the muscles of the ureters are de- scribed as two cartilaginous bodies, running from the .mouths of the ureters towards the urethra, and terminating in the caput galinaginis. On a super- ficial examination, they present very much this appearance; but Mr. Bell has shewn that they are muscular, and that they are attached by a tendinous band to the substance of the prostate. He is in- correct, however, in describing them as attached to the third lobe. This is proved by the preparation I have just described, which is at the same time an example of the truth of his theory, viz. that this particular enlargement is produced by the action of the muscles of the ureters. I have very lately dissected another diseased prostate, which, though differing vety much from the two I have already mentioned, is, notwith- standing, illustrative of the subject. The gland was taken from a man sixty years of age. It is enlarged, the opening of the urethra is of great size, and the bladder does not appear to have suf- fered from dilatation ; there are three distinct pro- jections from the prostate into the bladder, but there is no projection in the usual place: the muscles of the ureters are not increased in strength. On the back part, I perceive the third lobe slightly enlarged, and projecting downwards.

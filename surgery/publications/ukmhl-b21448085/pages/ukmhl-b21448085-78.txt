50 SECOND REPORT. 2. Are we enough aware of that progress of suffocation, in which the last train of symptoms, and the quiet manner of death, afford no indica- tion of the nature of the disease, yet where spas- modic stricture of the glottis is the real, though the remote, cause of death ? 3. Have surgeons always attended to the proper time for performing bronchotomy, and have they not thought of relieving the trachea, when already the lungs were irretrievably oppressed with mucus in the bronchi, and effusion in their cellular tex- ture ? 4. Has not the introduction of a tube into the larynx or trachea, sometimes defeated the object of the operation ? >5. Are practitioners sufficiently aware, that the operation may be done with a lancet and the end of a tea-spoon, and in circumstances when the more complicated apparatus of a tube will cause suffocation ? 6. In cutting out a portion of the larynx, or cutting the rings of the trachea, have we duly considered the danger of granulations projecting from the cut edge of the cartilage into the tube; or of the cartilages being curled or drawn in so as to diminish the calibre of the tube ?

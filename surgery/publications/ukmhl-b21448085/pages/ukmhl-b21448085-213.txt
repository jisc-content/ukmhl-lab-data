Breathes easily; emphysema diminishing; his cough is better, but he still has pain in the side, on making a long inspiration. 28.

We have here a case intermediate betwixt the first and second, in the degree of distention of the cellular membrane by the air. The punctures were made, not to prevent the air extending further over the body, which, though a frightful looking thing, is not attended with bad consequences, but to let the. air escape more freely from the chest. If it had not had this effect, and if the breathing had not been relieved, I Avould have made an incision through the intercostal muscles, and punc- tured the pleura costalis. I have observed, in common cases, that the air has been absorbed from the cellular texture about the sixth and seventh day.

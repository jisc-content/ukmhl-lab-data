Mr. Ludlow accounts for the formation of the bag by the accidental falling of a cherry-stone into the rugae, or betwixt the loose folds of the pha- rynx. He supposes the cherry-stone to have been forced deeper by every successive morsel after its lodgment, and that by little and little, food also was forced into the bag, until at length it was enlarged so as to occupy a great space betwixt the oeso- phagus and spine.

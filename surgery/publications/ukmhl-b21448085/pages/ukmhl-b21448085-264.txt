220 CASES OF FEMORAL HERNIA. guishable. An opening, through which the little finger could be introduced, communicated with the gut, and formed an anus at the groin. On opening the abdomen, two portions of the ileon were seen tending to one point, the pas- sage under the femoral ligament; they were in close contact, and agglutinated as they approached the passage, and adhered to the peritoneum. In the preparation, it is still observable that these two portions of the intestine have one opening towards the groin, which is owing to the wasting of the intermediate septum ; and here it appears, that if the opening had been closed outwardly by granu- lations or adhesions, a communication might still have remained betwixt the two portions of the in- testines. When we look to the preparation, it appears an easy matter to pierce or to destroy that septum by either of the means I have spoken of: but let it be remembered, that when the anus at the groin is thus established, the opening is irregular and deep. Although it maybe easy to find the passage by which the fseces came out, it does not follow that the passage to the lower part of the intestine shall be found with the same ease. Here is an ad- ditional reason for passing the seton ligature into the extremities of the gut, in preference to pass- ing it through the mesentery at the time of the first operation. The ligature serves to distinguish the two extremities of the gut, and if it do not prove effectual to the formation of a communica- 3

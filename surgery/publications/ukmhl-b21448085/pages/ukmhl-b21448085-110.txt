THIRD REPORT. 82 cases, where the stricture is obstinate, and the disease of longer continuance. From the specimens before us, as well as from the recollections of the natural structure, we shall be convinced of the propriety of introducing the oesophagus bougie with a gentle hand:—it re- quires dexterity, not force. The true stricture, which belongs to the inner membrane of the oeso- phagus only, is weak, and must be easily over- come. The circumstance of the natural thinness of the coats, the possibility of the instrument being engaged in a bag, or obstructed by a tumor, and not a contraction, should teach us to press lightly. But there is another cause of difficulty in the introduction of the bougie, proceeding from the natural form and connexions of the pharynx and oesophagus. This subject I propose to treat at large on another occasion, but I may notice it here as an additional reason for operating with precaution in the introduction of the bougie into the throat. I believe that common inflammatory sore throat will sometimes, be the foundation of stricture in the oesophagus, and certainly inflammations of the tube, from violence done to it, will have this effect; for example :— XIII. 2. M. 6. Is a specimen of stricture so remarkable, that I have engraved it in a plate. Twenty years before this woman’s death, she swallowed soap lees. This produced inflamma- tion, which terminated in stricture. She died literally starved.

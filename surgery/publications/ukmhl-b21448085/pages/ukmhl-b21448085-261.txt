CASES OF FEMORAL HERNIA. 217 good for nothing, and worse than nonsensical; they mislead. Nor is the practice, though possible, much bet- ter, where the surgeon passes a ligature through the mesentery, to retain the mortified gut from slipping into the abdomen. The manner of accom- plishing every indication, is this : having cleared away the mortified portion of the intestine, attend carefully to the two canals which are left, the one leads to the superior, the other to the inferior por- tion of the intestinal canal. Pass the needle, car- rying a seton cord, deep into the one orifice, and bring it out by the other. This will retain the intestine in its place, if that be necessary, and in due time it will form a communication be- twixt the two portions, by which the continuity of the canal will be restored. M. Dupuytren employs a very ingenious manner , of restoring the continuity of the gut in cases of anus at the groin; he introduces the leg of a pair of forceps (formed for the purpose) into each ori- fice or portion of gut; these, being closed, meet at their extremities only, and first hold the por- tions of the gut together, and by continuing so to keep the instrument shut, by a mechanical con- trivance, mortification takes place in the parts thus compressed, and consequently a communica- tion is in the end, established betwixt the two portions of intestine. This is a very ingenious method, and I have no doubt is practicable. The manner I have offered VOL. i.â€”PT. II. Q

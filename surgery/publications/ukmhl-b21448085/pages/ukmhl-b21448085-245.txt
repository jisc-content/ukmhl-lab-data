CASES OF FEMORAL HERNIA. 201 tumour which still required a little dissection before it could be understood. It was dissected all around, and still it presented more of the form of a tumour than of a hernia, as described by authors ;* for it hung like a glandular tumour, pendulous by its narrow neck or funiculus of vessels. Proceeding to open the sac, the omentum pre- sented of a dingy straw colour, very hard and con- densed by the pressure; and this mass, so unlike the natural omentum, looked as if we had only got into the heart of a tumour. The omentum being drawn out and unfolded, it seemed to occupy the sac so entirely, that the gut might have escaped my notice ; but on careful ex- amination, I found lurking behind and under the omentum, a small knuckle or single turn of the' intestine. Without the conviction from the symp- toms of there being a portion of the canal strangu- lated, and which led to a careful examination, the gut might have escaped us. It was of a dark colour and gorged with blood. The finger was now pushed up to the neck of the sac, which was extremely narrow ; the bistoury was introduced upon the finger, and a touch, the very slightest imaginable, a nick of the knife, just sen- sible, and which would hardly have appeared on * This is improper; for if the outside of the herniary sac be thus separated, it must slough after the reduction, being deprived of its vessels.

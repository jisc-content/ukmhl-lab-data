About two months after this,she had a return of the rupture, with the same excessive pain. From this time she could not take her infant in her arms without danger of bringing down the rupture. These attacks continued for three years; after which she had a period of the same length without experiencing any inconvenience. But one day, after a long walk, she found the swelling descend again, and she became subject as formerly to its frequent return. When it descended, although it was painful, she could always force it up, until Saturday last. On this day, she was sitting down to breakfast, when she was attacked with pain, and found the old swelling had come into her groin. She tried her usual applications, but they all failed. The pain became intolerable, and it continued night and day; and for a fortnight she was in this state of suffering and without evacuation. This is her condition since she has been brought into the hospital. In the right groin there is a small tumour, compressible, and retaining for some time the impression of the finger ; when touched it gives exquisite pain : purgatives and clysters of the most stimulating kind have been given without procuring stool; and she has had stercoraceous vo- miting for ten days. An operation was immediately undertaken, but without much hope of success.

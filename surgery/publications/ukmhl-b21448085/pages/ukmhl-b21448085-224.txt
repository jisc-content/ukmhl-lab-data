180 CASES OF FEMORAL HERNIA. consequence of its distention ; but there is on stricture on the blood vessels of the intestine: 4. The intestine is strangulated, which is that state, when not only the alimentary matter is ob- structed in the canal, but when the blood in the vessels is also obstructed, and there is momentary danger of mortification. Without attending to these last distinctions, it is not possible to comprehend how the circum- stances of cases differ essentially, while they are attended by exactly similar symptoms; or how a patient shall labour under signs of danger for many days, and recover; while another shall be cut off from hope, in as many hours. It is meant to limit the subject, in the first place, to this consideration of the change from incarceration to strangulation of the intestine ; that is, from the state of obstruction of the alimentary matter in the canal, to obstruc- tion of the circulation and consequent mortification of the gut. We often find, in dissecting-room subjects, a small process of the peritoneum, like the finger of a glove, pushed into the abdominal openings, and empty. This is the first stage of the formation of a hernia, and I believe that even in the cases where the gut comes down suddenly, during vio- lent exertion, there is a partial descent previ- ously existing, making a predisposition to a more formidable rupture. The progress of the hernia is probably in this manner: a portion of the intes- tine, or small part of the omentum, is pushed

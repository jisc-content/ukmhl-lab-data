156 FRACTURE OF THE SPINE. agitate is this: how far does the analogy hold in fracture and depression of the skull, and fracture of the spine with crushing of the spinal marrow? 1 have not found a young surgeon who has enter- tained any doubt on this question; and some, who have just proceeded so far in their studies as to know why the depressed portion of the skull is to be elevated, I have found very decisive in their opinions, considering the operation as equally fit to be adopted in fracture and crushing of the spine. They confidently ask; where is the difference? a bone is injuring the brain and it is raised : a por- tion of bone is depressed upon the spinal marrow : let an incision be made and the portion of bone withdrawn ! They are encouraged in this by disquisitions in dictionaries of surgery, and by the discussions of lecturers. M. Boyer, the latest French authority on the subject, objects to the proposal only on this ground, that the indication is never sufficiently clear to authorise the operation, and our English authors object, because Ave might mistake concus- sion for fracture. 1. Now it is my â€œbelief that an incision through the skin and muscles covering the spine, and the Avithdrawing of a portion of the circle of bone, which surrounds the marrow, Avould be inevitably fatal. For it is not sufficiently observed, that the membranes of the spinal marrow are the most sus- ceptible of inflammation and suppuration of the whole frame ; not exceeded by those of the brain

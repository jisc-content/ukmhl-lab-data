STRUCTURE OP THE PROSTATE GLAND. 223 which proceed from the mouths of the ureters, were small muscles, and that they were inserted by a common tendon into the prostate gland. In the same paper he gives an ingenious theory, to account for the projection of a particular portion of the prostate into the bladder. In every case which I have examined, of that which is called disease of the third lobe, I have found his idea to be correct; that is to say, the portion of the gland to which the muscles of the ureters are attached, has been the part from which the projecting tumour arose. Though I agree with him in his theory, which I am sure every one who examines his collection in Windmill-street must also do, still there is one part of his essay which I think incorrect. I mean his description of the insertion of the muscles ; but before I notice this more particularly, I shall state the circumstances which gave origin to my more immediate investigation of this subject. About three years ago, I found a diseased blad- der, the appearance of which led me to form the idea that the disease of the prostate, which forms a tumour within the bladder, was not always pro- duced by the enlargement of the third lobe; but from the manner in which the preparation was mangled by a young student, who not only divided the pelvis, but also the prostate, with the saw, I was unable to judge accurately of the state of the third lobe; however it was evidently a portion of the gland anterior to the third lobe that projected into the bladder. I preserved the parts, and the prepa-

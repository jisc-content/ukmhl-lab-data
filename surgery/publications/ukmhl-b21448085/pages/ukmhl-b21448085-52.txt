I stopt and encouraged her; not without hopes that this effectual bleeding would be of service : and she did breathe with somewhat more ease. I now dissected on the fore part of the trachea, cutting very deep, and much blood flowed. At this time an appearance presented itself, which should be taken notice of, and if authors had written only after actual experience of opera- tion, it would have been pointedly observed. The sterno-hyoidei and sterno-thyroidei muscles were powerfully in action during each inspiration; and they raised themselves into an appearance of two round columns, and by their starting forwards gave an unusual depth to the trachea.

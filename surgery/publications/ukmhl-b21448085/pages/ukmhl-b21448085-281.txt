amputation at the shoulder joint. 237 the humerus, as performed in the York hospital*, was set about with very confused notions, is evi- dent from the expression they have used in the report of the case. To remove the bone, “ it became necessary to separate the capsular ligament from its connexions with the neck of the bone and contiguous muscles, viz. teres major, pecloralis major, latissimus dorsi, c§r subclavius.1' However familiar with the term, they ought to have known that the muscles to which this distinction of ma- jor is given, have no interference with the capsule of the joint, any more than the subclavius. The operation required three quarters of an hour, two arteries were tied, and two pounds of blood were lost. Here is another indication of the se- verity of the operation, and of the improper man- ner in which it was planned. On the subject of this operation generally, I have only to add, that if at any time it shall be necessary to make an in- cision across the arm, the middle portion of the deltoid should be preserved entire, to be a coun- terpoise to the pectoralis major, or latissimus dorsi j\ * I know that this operation was well done; I have seen the operator do things of greater difficulty. I only criticise the plan of this operation and the case, as it appears before the public; had it been the work of one head and two hands, I should not have noticed it. f It is no apology to say that it may be necessary to cut of!

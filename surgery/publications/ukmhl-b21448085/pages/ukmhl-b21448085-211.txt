AND FRACTURED RIB. 167 lis, and opened the air cells, making a wound equal to half a square inch. There were five other ribs fractured besides those which penetrated the lungs. The surface of the lungs was red around the part injured. The viscera of the abdomen were na- tural. Observations on the Case. I need scarcely remind you of the true nature of this case. 1. The extremity of the broken rib, wounds the surface of the lungs—2. The enlarge- ment of the walls of the chest in inspiration sucks the air through the lungs, and by successive mo- tions accumulates it in the cavity of the chest—3. The lungs are then compressed, the side is kept elevated, and the freedom of respiration is check- ed—4. The distention of the cavity more and more, is at last attended with a disturbance of the other side of the chest; for the diaphragm is thrust down, the mediastinum pushed aside, and the capacity of that other side and of the lungs conse- quently, is so diminished, that the patient is every moment in danger of suffocation. What are his suf- ferings this case strongly proves.

The distention of the right side would have been removed by the escape of the air, the diaphragm would have been free to act, and the mediastinum would have regained its place, and

CASES OF DISEASES OF THE LARYNX, &C. 25 depth of the trachea was not less than an inch in inspiration and expiration. This motion I fore- saw would baffle my endeavours to adapt tubes or other instruments to the perforation of the windpipe. I therefore enlarged the wound a very little upward, laid down the isthmus of the thyroid gland, and exposed the space betwixt the cricoid and thyroid cartilages. I then pushed a sharp bistoury into the membrane, which closes the interstice betwixt these cartilages. As soon as this was done, the air in expiration came forcibly and audibly out, spurting the secretion from the hole; nothing could more forcibly shew the ne- cessity of the incision. I turned the bistoury upwards and downwards, enlarging the slit as far as possible without cutting the cartilages. I next introduced a spatula, and turning it round, opened the slit ; immediately the harsh sawing sound of the air in the contracted glottis ceased, and the air played easily with a siffling sound through the wound. Very soon the woman relaxed all her exertions, and her eye-lids closed. I thought she had fainted or was dying ; but the poor exhausted creature had dro.pt into a sleep where she sat, relieved from the necessity of exertion and from the sense of suffocation, even the novelty of her situation did not prevent her from falling asleep. Having remained a very considerable time hold- ing the instrument in the opening of the larynx, I proceeded to execute my final purpose. I made a transverse slit in the membrane, and introduced

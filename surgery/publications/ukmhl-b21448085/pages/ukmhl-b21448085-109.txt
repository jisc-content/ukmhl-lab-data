CASES OP DISEASED PHARYNX, &C. 61 examples recorded. So that even in the very- worst stricture possible, and where it is the cause of death, it does not necessarily follow, that ul- ceration shall take place. The state of parts exhibited in the instance of Drusilla Champ, and the progress of the disease when left to itself, will prove the necessity of inter- ference. And I may venture to suggest, that the proper course is the use of the bougie. But in the stricture of the oesophagus, as in the stricture of the urethra, cases will occur, where the attempt to dilate will bring on spasm and obstructions, and where the caustic becomes necessary ; so that I am very sensible of the great benefit which the profession has derived from the example of Sir Everard Home. We may observe, that in the case of Hawkins, both the simple bougie and the caustic bougie gave relief, when introduced into the oesophagus, and here again the analogy betwixt the urethra and the oesophagus recurs. The very satisfactory effect produced by the caustic, in the cage of Hawkins, might lead us to prefer this mode of treatment ; yet I confess that the very circum- stance of the obstruction yielding so quickly to the means employed, appears to me a reason why the caustic, though happy in its effects, was not in this case necessary. And in similar affections of the throat, I would advise the pupils to be con- tented with the introduction of the bougie; and reserve the use of caustic for more formidable VOL. I. PT. I. G

CASES OF FEMORAL HERNIA. 183 were cut across were inactive, and did not bleed freely, although they were of a size that we could discern their orifices. The peritoneal sac was so weak that in pinching it up with the forceps (intending to cut it by car- rying the knife horizontally), it burst, and dark serum was discharged. The portion of the intestine included in the stricture formed a body an inch and a half in dia- meter, and was perfectly globular. It was of a dark reddish, brown colour, and adhered by coagulable lymph to the neck of the sac, on the side towards the ilium ; a lacteal vessel was visible on the sur- face ; it was large and tortuous, and loaded with colourless matter. On separating the neck of the sac from the gut, which I did by drawing up the neck of the sac with my finger and thumb, a little matter exuded, which I hoped, from its consistence, might be pus ; but on smelling it, the deplorable nature of the case was made evident: it was faeculent. This matter came so directly from under the sharp stric- ture, that I could not at first determine whether it came from the gut, or from the cavity of the ab- domen. Having cut the sharp' edge of the stricture, and disengaged the gut from its firm embrace, I drew the intestine gently down. When this was done, there appeared no opening, but only a dark sloughy spot, obscured by coagulable lymph, nor could I find the passage into the gut with the

THIRD REPORT. S4 nerves of the tongue, pharynx, oesophagus, and stomach, before us, and when we see distinctly these numerous connexions of nerves reaching in a complicated net-work from the abdomen to the tongue, we then receive the true impression of the prevailing nature of these disorders. The succession of actions necessary to deglu- tition are these: 1. The retraction of the tongue and the rising of the larynx. 2. The distention and contraction of the pharynx. 3. The succes- sive contractions of the oesophagus. 4. The yielding of the passage of the diaphragm and simultaneous relaxation of the cardiac orifice of the stomach. Spasmodic difficulty of swallowing, for the most part, takes place at the termination of the lower constrictor pharyngis, or at the termina- tion of the tube in the stomach. From which it would appear that the derangement consists in the one set of muscular fibres refusing to enter upon the succession of actions, which should be propagated from the other. There are two diseased actions which may be mistaken for stricture or scirrhous ulcer of the passage, viz. spasms of the muscular coat and paralysis, for they equally prevent the passage of the morsel. These affections are transitory, and merely symptomatic. Their cause is in the stomach, or more remotely in the liver or uterine system. Thus in the youth of both sexes the disorder may be introduced with a spasmodic cough, attended with cold and weight in the pre-

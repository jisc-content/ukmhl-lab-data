IV PREFACE. Inquiry into the present state of Surgery, and it cannot be more safely undertaken than in the form of Observations made at the bed-side of the pa- tients. In published cases, a very common defect is too much consistency—matters proceed so smooth- ly, that when the young Surgeon enters on the actual duties of his profession, he is troubled with adverse occurrences, for which he is quite unpre- pared : and he wonders to find his experience so different from what he has been led to expect from the perusal of Cases. The utility of Cases arises from the confessions of the Surgeon which exer- cise the reader’s mind, and enable him to antici- pate the harassing difficulties of practice. Who- ever proposes to publish useful Cases, must have a full dependence on the candour and liberality of his readers, and forget those who lie in wait for oc- casions of rancorous criticism. He has to draw two parallel histories—the history of symptoms, and the history of his own mind, with his doubts and anxieties during the course of the disease. Just so far as the observer’s mind is active, and the communication of his thoughts free, will the Cases be useful. The Author wishes to avoid that distortion which love of system produces in Cases which are given in illustration of particular doctrines. He hopes to combine the interest and usefulness which arise from the perusal of Cases, classed so as to enforce practical results, with the genuine and un-

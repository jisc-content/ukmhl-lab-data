CASES OF DISEASES OF THE LARYNX, &C. 21 From these preparations it may be inferred, that ulceration of the glottis is a frequent complaint, and by the circumstances of cases presently to be detailed, it will be made evident that this is a fatal disease, if not remedied. Further, it appears that there are two kinds of ulcer, affecting this part: 1. A slow chronic ulcer, probably scrofulous. 2. And another venereal. These preparations exhibit the ravages of a disease which is much more frequent than practi- tioners seem to be aware of, a disease which deserves the name of Phthysis Laryngea, for it has all the consequences of true phthysis. The glan- dular structure of the trachea and larynx is the seat of this disease, the glands become enlarged, then ulcerate, and throw out purulent secretion. When the trachea only is affected, the disease is protracted; when it affects the larynx, it more rapidly exhausts the patient.

These primary symptoms are succeeded by pain in the chest, from the labour of respiration, and finally, the lungs are op- pressed by effusion *. * There is a preparation [belonging to another series, XIII. 2.

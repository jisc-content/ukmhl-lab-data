228 AMPUTATION AT THE SHOULDER JOINT. principles of the profession. The patients in mi- litary life are not drawn to their surgeons by their reputation—they have no power of selection—mis- fortune brings them under very absolute practi- tioners ; and this has often struck me as a reason why the army and navy surgeons should confine themselves to rules acknowledged by the general sense of the profession. After the battle of Corunna, I went to Ports- mouth, and lived a short time in Haslar hospital, where I studied, I hope, with all diligence under that excellent surgeon, Mr. Vance. They would joke with me on my picking up the bones shattered by gun-shot, saying these would make fine stories for lecture ! These bones were of much use to me; and although, at first, I sought for them simply as the examples of such fractures as the united navy and army surgeons condemned to amputa- tion ; gradually, as I saw more into the subject! I began to question the propriety of their decisions.* I prosecuted the subject in the York hospital, for Mr. Knight was liberal in the discharge of his office. My opinions published, and expressed re- peatedly in lecture, were, if possible, more than ever confirmed by what I witnessed of the wounded at Waterloo. * See the Section of Gun-shot Wounds, in the end of my Operative Surgery also published separately.

54 THIRD REPORT. throat towards the ear and back of the head. But she speaks very ignorantly, desiring to have some- thing to bring down the substance to her throat, so as to give her ease. I have made her attempt to swallow a little warm milk; she made great efforts to get over a little, pressing her hands against her ears expres- sive of great pain. This pain is obviously from the distention of the pharynx, and the consequent affection of the Eustachean tubes; for, she says, the pain flies to her ears. But as the left ear is most affected, and as the disease is felt most dis- tinctly upon the left side of the pharynx, we may conclude that it is the pressure against the dis- eased part w hich communicates pain to the ear. When I put my finger into her throat I can dis- tinctly feel the epiglottis, and pushing the finger beyond this I can distinguish the left side of the false glottis to be irregular and tuberculated; but I think not ulcerated. Still further back I can feel a tumor projecting into the pharynx, having its root on the back part of the larynx. Finding so much disease of the pharynx, and that the patient was weak from defect of nourish- ment, I thought of introducing a tube into the oesophagus, so that she might be fed without pro- ducing the irritation consequent on the frequent action of swallowing. But on attempting the in- troduction of the tube, I found that it was ob- structed, and that it gave too much pain and irri- tation to answer my intentions.

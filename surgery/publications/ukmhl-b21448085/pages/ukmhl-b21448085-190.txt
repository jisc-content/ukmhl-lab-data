FRACTURE OF THE SPINE. 146 with him said that the wheel of the cart (which was empty) had gone over the small of his back ; but after the first day he never complained of that part. Leeches were applied to the spine betwixt the shoulders, and his bowels were opened. For nearly a week he lay without complaining of any thing, except stiffness in the back part of his neck, and up to this period he had no symptom of paralysis; on the contrary, he could throw his arms and legs about, and retain his faeces and urine, and expel them naturally. On the 8th day he was almost instantaneously seized with convulsions over the whole body. He was relieved, in some degree, by bleeding, and continued sensible though his jaw was locked. His pulse, at this time, was very strong. Two hours after the first bleeding the convulsions were returning with more violence, when he was bled a second time. A few minutes after the second bleeding his lower jaw moved with great rapidity, and continued moving in an extraordinary manner for nearly five minutes, when all at once he ex- claimed, with great animation, that he could speak. From the moment he began to speak he appeared to be maniacal, for his expressions had by no means the appearance of common deli- rium : at this juncture he clearly proved, by his exertions, that he was not at all paralytic, for it required two men to hold him, and he almost sprung out of bed to be revenged on the nurse.

SECOND REPORT. 44 kindness of my colleague, Mr. Cartwright, I have an opportunity of placing in this series. A young- woman in phrensy plunged a penknife into her throat. The point of the knife pierced the upper part of the thyroid cartilage, so that it entered at the union of the chorda yocales. Yet it is worthy of notice that she died not in consequence of the inflammation and irritation from the wound. She was suffocated at the distance of some months by the granulations which arose from the edge of the wound, and which filled up the passage of the glottis. This is a circumstance of great interest, and in the case of laryngotomy which I have de- tailed, it will be seen how much the granulations*- endangered the patientâ€™s life. In the present ex- ample we have a simple wound of the larynx where there was no disease, finally causing suffo- cation after the patient was enabled to go about her usual occupations, and at the distance of some months from the infliction of the wound. This instance of death by suffocation in the suicide, re- minds me of the necessity of performing the opera- tion of laryngotomy or bronchotomy on those who have cut their throats, as well as in some cases where they have perpetrated the act by firing a pistol into the mouth. Within these few months a man was brought into the Middlesex Hospital who had cut his throat. There were times when he suffered vio- lently from difficulty of breathing, and then a flap- ping of something in the throat could be heard.

96 FOURTH REPORT. sluggish, advised ail injection of sulphate of zinc. The experiment to be made cautiously on one of the sinuses. March 2Sth. One of the openings still discharges, and 1 find him still confined. The remaining in- teguments have drawn themselves about the testi- cles so as greatly to conceal the ravages which have taken place. He must be sent out of town to re- gain force of constitution for the filling up of the sinuses; they are beco.me habitual. April 2C)th. Being again called here, I find the sinuses still open, and running all round the belly to the loins. The matter has dropt down upon the scrotum on the right side, where there is redness and tumor. I have passed a seton from the open- ing on the left side of the belly to that above the left groin. I have opened the abscess on the right side of the scrotum, and have given a de- pending orifice to all the sinuses and ulcers around the right haunch. The sinuses were injected with solution of zinc, and a more perfect apparatus of compression used; he takes the Islandic moss, and milk diet. 23d. All the sinuses of the right side amended. The seton on the left side has caused some inflam- mation, and a purulent discharge with foetor. I have withdrawn it, and bound down compresses on the tract of the sinus. From this time the patient made rapid amend- ment. The sinuses closed, and he regained his wonted health. Â»

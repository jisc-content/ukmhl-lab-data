218 CASES OF FEMORAL HERNIA. is in imitation of the process of Nature, and it is always possible to do it. The instrument is a needle, and at hand : an instrument of so peculiar a form, as that of the French surgeon, will proba- bly not be found when it is wanted. Those who think, that to praise a man’s book is to say he is my friend, and to criticise it is to de- clare the author is my enemy, will not compre- hend how I can exult in the true splendour and use- fulness of Mr. Cooper’s work, as an honour to the time and the country, and yet object to parti- cular parts. Nevertheless, this is the only just criticism ; for where the particular advice is wrong, the general merit’ makes the passage more dan- gerous. In his 12th Case, he spread the sphacelated portion of intestine in his hand, and cut off the mortified portion ; after which he made three su- tures upon the intestine, to bring its edges together; the intestine was then pushed as near as possible to the mouth of the herniary sac, p. 31. In the 11th Case, two inches and a half of the intestine were cut off, and the ends of the intestine joined by three sutures, so as to leave a small opening for the discharge of faeces. In the 9th Case, he passed a needle and ligature through the mesen- tery, and fixed it to the mouth of the herniary sac, and then made a large opening into the intes- tine two hours after, he dilated the stricture, and then the faeces rushed down into the mortified in- testine, and were discharged.

To be able to distinguish symptoms, we must attend particularly to their cause, which is in the intestine. The changes to which the intestine is subject, has not been inquired into, with all that diligence which has been so happily exercised in regard to the anatomy of the rings. I have in the following cases stated some occur- rences in practice, which reflect light on the pathology of hernia ; a subject which I had long

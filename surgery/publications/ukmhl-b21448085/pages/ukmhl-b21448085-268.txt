224 STRUCTURE OF THE PROSTATE GLAND. ration is now in the section of diseased prostates in Mr. Bellâ€™s Museum. The next opportunity I had of examining this disease, was in a subject where the projection of a part of the prostate into the bladder was in its first stage. The patient had long laboured under fistula in ano, of a very compli- cated nature ; he was worn out with repeated sup- purations, and was at length carried off by diarrhoea. On opening his bladder, I saw the muscles of the ureters particularly strong and very distinct from the other muscular fibres of the bladder ; indeed these were not unusually strong. At the point of the prostate to which these muscles were attached, I found a projection of the size of a bean, evidently the commencement of that tumour which has been called disease of the third lobe. I made a careful dissection of all the parts round the neck of the bladder; and on the back part, I made the same dissection as that described by Sir Everard Home, in his description of the third lobe. I removed the vesiculae seminales and ducts of the testicle, and though there was an evident projection of part of the gland into the inside of the bladder, still that part which is called the third lobe, was as distinct as it is found in a subject the most favora- ble for the dissection. There are two points shewn in this preparation. 1. The commencement of a valvular obstruction to the urine, produced by the projection of a part of the prostate into the bladder, which part is anterior to the third lobe, 2. That the muscles of the

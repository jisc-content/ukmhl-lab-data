CASES OF DISEASES OF THE LARYNX, &C. 31 wound, I have made her breathe through an inhaler, which has given much relief. This poor woman is dead, after living seven weeks breathing through the artificial opening; for the last two or three days there has been more irritability of constitution and temper exhibited. She has complained much of want of breath, and shown unusual impatience. Last night she was seized with great difficulty of breathing, ran frantic about the ward, lay or fell down upon the floor, and with much violence tore the instrument from her throat, and was suffocated. Her usual careful attendants, Mr. Dehane and Mr. Heath, were called from their beds, and at- tempted to restore her by the apparatus of the Humane Society, but she was dead. The larynx of this woman is preserved, and â–  already enumerated. XT. 1. M. 10. A loose spongy granulation sprung from the sacculus laryngis of the left side, and lay completely closing the chink of the glottis ; beneath this there was a deep ulcer; and within the thyroid cartilage were several ulcers ; on both lateral faces of the thyroid cartilage there were abscesses, these abscesses communicated with the ulcers within, the centre part of the cartilage on both sides, being destroyed by absorption. The lungs were free from disease, but having been blown into in the attempt to recover the woman, I could not form a just estimate of their condition.

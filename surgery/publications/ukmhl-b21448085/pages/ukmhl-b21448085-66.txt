SECOND REPORT. 3S She is to take the nitro-muriatic bath every se- cond night. 5th. The bath to be altogether omitted. Dr. Scott visited this patient; he never saw the mouth so sore from the operation of this remedy. 30th. I examined this girl yesterday, and find her almost well. She says that she has not been so well for years as she now finds herself. Her countenance is indeed that of health. In swallow- ing, she takes five or six draughts in rapid succes- sion ; but when she swallows leisurely a single mouthful, as I made her do to-day, she does it without coughing. Some weeks after this Report, Fanny Murray placed herself in the way of the surgeon’s round, and gave me her thanks in a very eloquent manner, to the amusement of the pupils; and next day she took an unceremonious leave of the Hospital*. * Although her physician had watched her with the most hu- mane attention, my desire of witnessing the effects of the new remedy had won upon the girl’s gratitude.

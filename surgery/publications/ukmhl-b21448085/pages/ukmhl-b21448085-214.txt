170 FRACTURE OF THE SPINE. rity. But it is equally my duty to say that they will not, on this subject, find the distinct statement of facts, nor the lucid reasoning which in general characterizes the works of that gentleman. We find him doubting whether the lungs col- lapse when the chest is opened; of opinion that there are two states of emphysema ; and recom- mending the practice of Sir William Blizard, to bandage the chest, in order to prevent the air from escaping; and further, he combats the opinion, that the air collected on one side of the chest, oppresses the action of the opposite side. From the notions which I have heard expressed by very intelligent surgeons, on service, in the cases of wounds of the chest, it is evident to me that these opinions of Mr. Abernethy have had the effect of confounding the studentsâ€™ ideas upon this subject. I hope to have an occasion of returning to it, and of explaining the experiments on respiration, which have thrown an obscurity on this matter. At pre- sent I shall only add : 1. That in slighter degrees of emphysema, the patient generally does well. The practice is as in a common case of fracture of the rib. He is bled again, as the pulse rises, or when the breath- ing is oppressed; the chest is swathed, that he may be forced to breathe with his diaphragm, and give rest to the rib. 2. That in cases where the air extends far, still it is only frightful, and nothing need be done ; but if with this there be much oppression of breathing.

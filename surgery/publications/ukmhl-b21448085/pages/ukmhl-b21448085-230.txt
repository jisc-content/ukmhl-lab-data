186 CASES OF FEMORAL HERNIA. braced by the stricture. I have observed, that in this case there was a turgid lacteal seen upon the surface of the strangulated intestine. In the state of mere incarceration, no doubt these vessels are active, and retard that perfect fulness which proves so fatal: but by the increasing tightness betwixt the intestine and the neck of the sac, the larger lacteals must loose their office, and partake of the general turgescence. I beg my reader’s attention to one circumstance of this last case. We see here the necessity of drawing down the intestine before attempting the reduction; not only to bring the firmer part of the gut opposite to the stricture, but to examine the part, for in such a case as this, if the intestine were to be reduced, the faeces would be freely discharged into the cavity of the abdomen. In hernia, the signs of danger—the hiccough, the vomiting of faeces, the filling of the belly, the tormina, have not a direct relation to the strangulation of the gut, nor to the state of the gut included in the herniary sac. These signs proceed principally from the state of distention of the bowels within the belly, and are a consequence of the obstruction ; they do not, therefore, accord with the actual danger, in as far as that danger de- pends on the inflammation or mortification of the gut included in the hernial sac* As obstruction and consequent fulness of the intestinal canal are the sources of the more urgent

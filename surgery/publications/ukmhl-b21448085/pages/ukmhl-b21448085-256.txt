212 CASES OP FEMORAL HERNIA. side and its inner surface, are so fine and so very easily torn even by using the handle of theknife, that the surgeon, who has not all his recollections about him, is very apt to mistake it for the peritoneal coat; which error leads him further wrong. To call this the fascia, is to confound every thing, and to set a task for our demonstrators, which they never can execute, in shewing all which per- tains to hernia, in the anatomy of the natural body. This membranous bottle, which surrounds the inner sac or peritoneal sac, is made of the cellular texture, external to the peritoneum, and which it meets with as it descends. This loose texture spread oyer the proper sac, being compressed, con- densed, and suffering a kind of inflammatory pro- cess, is moulded into this regular form. It is, there- fore, not a thing to be seen in the natural state of the body; it is a woof, the rude material of which is visible in the natural state; but the manufac- tory is completed by the protrusion of the hernia. For want of a little precision, both in the names we use [calling that fascia which is merely con- densed cellular membrane] and in the description, the dissecting pupil is puzzled in his endeavour to discover parts of which he reads, and the surgeon is prepared for falling into the mistake of taking the sac for the gut, or making a discovery of a lusus: viz. one sac within another; and if we turn to the cases recorded of femoral hernia, where this circumstance occurred, we shall find reason for concluding, that the surgeons have been deceived

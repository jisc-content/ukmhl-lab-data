80 THIRD REPORT. pressions of the patients. The example of true stricture in the oesophagus, corrects the notion we should otherwise form. We see that inflammation will produce stricture, that the stricture will be progressively worse, because obstruction produces pain, pain inflammation, and inflammation in- crease of the stricture. So that here as elsewhere, a stricture necessarily gets worse and worse, until the canal is almost totally closed. We perceive that in the stricture of the oesopha- gus, the derangement is in the inner membrane of the tube, that there is no apparent disease of the tunica vaginalis gulae, nor any degree of thicken- ing of the glandular structure of the oesophagus. We owe our knowledge of this complaint to Sir Everard Home, tie has given an engraving and description of it, and has described its exact place to be immediately behind the cricoid cartilage. To see it delineated, he observes, appears in some measure necessary to force upon the mind a belief, that the area of the oesophagus can be so much diminished, while there is so little thickening of the surrounding parts, and so very small an ex- tent of the tube occupied by the disease. It will be further observed, that in the engrav- ing, which I have given, the stricture is not formed by a membranous partition, but by a general and somewhat irregular puckering of the whole mem- brane of the oesophagus. In the next place, we find no ulceration near the stricture, as in some

124 CARCINOMA OF THE BREAST the urinary bladder, or gall bladder, the pause may be a long oneâ€”months or even years. But when the growth is in the mammary gland, which has no capsule, or the tongue, or in the pharynx, there is, I believe, hardly any interval of time between the onset of the growth and its spread into the neighbouring lymphatics. For many years I have noted down the condition of the lymphatics whenever operating in malignant disease, and the above is not, I venture to think, an over-statement of the case. Some of the opera- tions, too, have been done at unusually early stages, because, as I have said elsewhere,^ it is my habit to make an immediate microscopical examination of the suspicious tumours. In this way many are, of course, met with at their very earliest appearance, and even then the lymphatics have been involved. For instance, a female had a small indurated ulcer of the left nipple. The ulcer looked and felt like a small Hunterian sore, but proved on micro- scopical examination to be cancerous. No enlarge- ment of the axillary lymphatic glands could be seen or felt. After the whole mammary gland and both pectoral muscles had been removed, several enlarged lymphatic glands were found ; the largest one was highest up, and adherent to the upper 1 The Early Microscopical Diagnosis of Tumours.

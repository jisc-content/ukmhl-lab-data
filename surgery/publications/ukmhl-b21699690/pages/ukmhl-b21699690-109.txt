THE ESSENTIALS OF A DIAGNOSIS 97 it vesicles and pustules. The surrounding tissues are oedematous and the neighbouring lymphatic glands enlarged. It is clear that the inflammation is spreading, that it is attended with pain, and that the patient is ill. On clinical grounds it would be hard to say that this was anthrax, but on scientific grounds a httle fluid removed from that so-called anthrax pustule might, and probably would, show the large square-ended bacillus, which would be quite distinctive. In addition, if a little of that fluid were placed in the body of a mouse, within forty-eight hours it would slay that mouse, and in its spleen and blood some anthrax bacilli would be found. Such a scientific diagnosis as that, of course, can be made apart from the patient, and the person who makes it need never have seen the patient. I need hardly remind you that the scientific diagnosis of diphtheria is made in this way nearly every day. But there is still another kind of diagnosis, and that is the kind with which you will all your Hves be con- cerned, a diagnosis which in the first place is clinical and in the second place is scientific; and that I would call, for the sake of brevity, a combined diagnosis. If what I am telling you is true, what does it mean ? The day will never come when it will be easy to make a clinical diagnosisâ€”the day will never come when the lack of properly trained powers of observa- tion can be atoned for by the test-tube or the microscope.

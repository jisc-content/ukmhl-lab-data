118 INFECTION OF LYMPHATIC GLANDS the deep surface of the sub-maxillary salivary gland. I took the trouble to look at some of the books on anatomy which I possess. It would be unjust to say that these glands (vide Fig. 3, e) are never mentioned by the anatomists, but they are merely mentioned in a cursory way, and possibly in small print at the bottom of the page ; the anatomist is not a surgeon, and it does not occur to his mind in the same way at all; he does not think of remov- ing an epithelioma of the tongue ; but if he were to do so and overlook malignant disease in the lymphatics hidden away in the sub-maxillary gland he would have done his patient very ill service and not any good. These particular lymphatics to any one who is going to operate are of the utmost importance. I have seen one of these lymphatic glands firmly attached to the under surface of the sub-maxillary gland, and perhaps one or two in its substance. Anatomists may not have seen them ; I have seen them because I have seen them enlarged in malignant disease. If the anatomist has injected for them and investigated the matter, he will be aware of their existence. If you are not aware of their existence, somebody will suffer. Supposing an operation is begun for the removal of mahgnant disease in glands in the neck, you will observe you are going a long way ; you have to remove the sub-mental gland, you have to look for this gland on the side of the tongue, you have to remove the sub-maxillary gland, and you cannot tell whether

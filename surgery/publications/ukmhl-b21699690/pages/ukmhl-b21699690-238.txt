For six months the patient had felt ill and lost flesh, but had merely a feeling of slight discomfort in the abdomen. Otherwise he had no symptoms to indicate disease of the stomach, liver, gall-bladder or intestines. The tumour was in the pylorus and had invaded the liver. Some enlarged lymphatic glands were felt behind the lesser sac of the peritoneum. Six months after this operation the medical man under whose care he was wrote that, although very emaciated, he was not any worse off. He suffered no pain or discomfort and ate and slept well, and in fact, generally, was better than before the opera- tion. Indeed, the patient had begun to doubt the correctness of the diagnosis. However, death took place three months after the letter was written— about nine months after the exploration. Such occurrences as these have made me very cautious how I venture to prognosticate the course which the malignant disease will pursue after an explora- tory operation. In another instance I was requested to perform exploratory laparotomy after unavailing attempts had been made to diagnose the cause of an accumu- lation of fluid—nearly always an ominous portent. When the fluid had escaped through the median incision a great quantity of malignant growth was

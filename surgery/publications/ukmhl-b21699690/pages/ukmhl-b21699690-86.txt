74 RECOGNITION AND MANAGEMENT OF has supervened to localize the seat of obstruction. Even an intussusception becomes obscured, or an intraperitoneal abscess, or a carcinoma of the caecum or of the sigmoid flexure. Now all surgeons would agree that the chances of a successful opera- tion are vastly greater when the abdomen is slack and when the operation has a clear objective, such as an easily felt tumour. Whilst performing laparo- tomy I have failed on more than one occasion to find the seat of obstruction, owing to the extreme intestinal distension. But now I feel less dread of extruding and emptying the distended bowels. The distension often necessitates that serious addi- tion to the operation, namely, the incision and emptying of the distended coils. I have had to do that twice this year. An infant recovered after the jejunum and ileum had been emptied. An adult died after a similar proceeding, but his acute obstruction had lasted for eighty hours before it was relieved. Distension has also another evil effect. We are all familiar with the paralysis of the urinary bladder which follows retention of urine. After the stretching the muscular coats refuse to contract, and catheters have to be passed. Now the muscular walls of the intestines suffer in the same way from gaseous and fsecal distension, with the result that after the cause of the obstruction has been relieved by operation an adequate passage of flatus and fseces does not take place, vomiting continues, and the patient dies.

CARCINOMA OF THE BREAST 133 I now come to another question, namely, the order in which the lymphatic glands become can- cerous. It is natural for us to assume that cancer follows the course of the lymph stream upon its way from the breast to the nearest group of lym- phatic glands. But to turn this generalization to account we must know the direction taken by the lymphatic vessels themselves, and then the direction of the lymph stream within their channels. Further, we have to assume that the cancerous particles or cancerous lymph, or whatever it may be, passes along the lymphatic channels in the direction of the assumed course of the lymph stream. But my own clinical observations have led me to think that it is quite unsafe to begin with preconceived ideas on these three points, or, in other words, to assume that the cancer will spread in some precon- ceived direction, and linger in some particular group of lymphatic glands. For instance, our earliest knowledge of the arteries and veins tells us that they anastomose but scantily across the middle line. Hence we easily infer that the lymphatics do the same. But clinical observation soon teaches us the untruth of such an inference. There can be little doubt but that the lymphatics of the breasts inter- communicate across the sternum. This allows, perhaps, of an explanation of such a case as this : A long-standing carcinoma of the left breast was removed, together with the pectoral muscles, the fascise, and all the axillary fat and

There, agam, a bacteriological examination of the urine showed that the urine was teeming with the colon bacillus, and after a very long and serious illness, from which it was thought he might die, he ulti- mately recovered. And so I might go on. I might tell you of another case of colon bacillus cystitis which I have recently seen, but I want to call your attention to this form of colon bacillus cystitis; there may be some one here who is eager to find some subject for clinical and scientific work, and in this I am sure he will find a most interesting and instructive topic. There is a curious thing about this colon bacillus cystitis, for the two patients of whom I spoke to you were husband and wife. And now again the third case, which I said I had recently observed, was seen by a medical man who

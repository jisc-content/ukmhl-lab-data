236 FiECAL LEAKS AND FISTULA leak or fistula is in the ileum or in some part of the large intestine. Before I proceed with the material which I pro- pose to place before you, it is necessary that some kind' of classification should be adopted. One might, as is one's custom, use an anatomical classi- fication, and speak of duodenal leaks and fistulse, of those in the jejunum, or in the ileum, or in the caecum, or in the colon, the sigmoid, and so forth ; but that, I think you would find, would lead to a great deal of repetition, and it would be impossible to condense what I have to say into the short time at my disposal. I therefore will proceed with the ordinary clinical classification of leaks and fistulse into those which are congenital and those which are acquired, and under the last heading would be the two subdivisions of traumatic and patholo- gical. The congenital or developmental leaks are not by any means common. Those which I have seen have usually been situated at the umbilicus.

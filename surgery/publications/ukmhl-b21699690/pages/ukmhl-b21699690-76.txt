64 INTRA-ABDOMINAL INFLAMMATION she any uterine fibroids ? ' I thought she might have some uterine fibroids which had become septic. He said, ' No, I am sure she has not.' I said, ' Then she must have a twisted or suppurating ovarian cyst.' Her abdomen was opened, and it was found that she had a suppurating ovarian cyst, which was bulging the right broad ligament. It was very fixed and exceedingly difficult to remove. Clearly in that case the cautious inference was the right one. When you encounter muscular rigidity, remember it sometimes protects malignant growths. What is the common course of malignant growth in the alimentary tract ? First, ulceration of the malignant growth, then sepsis from the intestinal contents, and then extension of septic inflammation to the visceral and parietal peritoneum, and to the abdo- minal wall, with the formation of abscess. The abdominal abscess may be opened by a thoughtless person, who may be surprised to find a fsecal leak which will never heal. Therefore, when a person has a rigid area, do not merely say it is due to septic inflammation pure and simple, such as from an appendix or from some other organ. You ought to weigh all the possibilities very carefully, and you may ultimately conclude that it is perfectly true you have to do with septic inflammation of the peritoneum, but behind that septic inflamma- tion you may find carcinoma of the colon, such as we saw the other day in the operating theatre, or of the pylorus, or of some part of the alimentary tract.

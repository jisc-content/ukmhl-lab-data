CARCINOMA OF THE BREAST 137 The outlook seemed as bad as could be, if, as seemed certain, both breasts were cancerous. But an immediate microscopical examination showed that the tumour in the left breast was a cystic adenoma, so after it had been taken away a complete operation was done for the carcinoma of the right side. More than a year afterwards this operation seemed to have been effectual. What can be the meaning of these incidents ? Why in the same person should one breast bring forth an innocent growth, and the other a malignant one ? It might save trouble to say that these were mere coincidences, but that would never help us to solve the riddle of this horrible, mysterious, and almost unknown disease. Thus it is probable that cancer may cross in the lymphatic channels from one breast to the other, but it is evidently rash to assume that it may have done so in any particular instance of bilateral tumours. I have already mentioned that lymphatics from the inner side of the breast may carry carcinoma into the mediastinal glands. I have only seen this in advanced cases, such as ought not to occur without an effort having been made to extirpate the disease in its earliest and more amenable stages. The admirable work of Mr. Handley ^ has also gone far to prove the growth of carcinoma from the ^ The Dissemination of Mammary Carcinoma, by W. Sampson Handley, Lancet, April 8, 1905, p. 909, et seq.

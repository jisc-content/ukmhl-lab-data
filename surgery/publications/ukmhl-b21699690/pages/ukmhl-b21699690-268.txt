¥MCAL LEAKS AND 250 abdomen contains a large quantity of fluid is a very successful operation indeed, and usually leads to the recovery of the patient. But an operation on a patient with an adhesive, plastic, hard kind of tuberculous peritonitis had better be avoided. I will just mention one other case of fistula, or intestinal leak, associated with tubercle, because that again, I believe, conveys a warning. I re- member seeing a young woman, who had a fluc- tuating swelling on the right side below the outer half of Poupart's ligament. Not only did it fluctuate below the ligament, but it was clear that some swelHng could be felt in the iliac fossa. This abscess was opened, and at the time I remem- ber warning the relatives that it was likely to be followed by a feecal leak. My reason for that warning—I may be wrong—was that my experience of abscesses at the outer part of Poupart's ligament which extend towards the back of the caecum is, that they are usually followed by a fsecal leak. I have seen several now, and I am always exceed- ingly suspicious of an abdominal abscess which tracks down the outer part of Scarpa's triangle. So this patient continued to leak for many months, and many attempts were made to close that leak. At last it became clear that something more would have to be done, and I made a final attempt by opening the abdomen and closing the opening m the csecum. The patient afterwards had acute intestinal obstruction and died. Such calamities

Why does not somebody investigate the fate of the part of the Wolffian body which lies between the suprarenal body and the epididymis ? I very strongly suspect, first of all, that the part in the hilum of the kidney accounts for those curious malignant adenomata of the kidney which are exactly like pieces of Wolffian body. Next proceed along the course of the ureter. I have removed curious cysts which otherwise appeared to be unaccountable. They are very like ovarian cysts, but they occur along the ureter and almost in the flank. I believe they are to be found also in males, though the two I have seen have been in females. This is a branch of pathology which is worth working up, and which I am sure will afford valuable results for any man who will pursue it. There are other things to be found in the inguinal canal besides fat. I have spoken of males so far, but I might have mentioned a case of lipoma in the female. The female has a smaller inguinal canal than the male, and it is less liable to disturbances. But occasionally odd things are found in the inguinal canal of the female.

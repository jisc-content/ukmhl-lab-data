DIAGNOSIS OF TUMOURS 261 diagnosis of tumours are rules for the diagnosis of tumours which have grown until almost beyond the possibility of scientific surgery. By scientific i mean certain-absolutely certain. At first a cancer of the breast is a small, hard, painless, movable nodule, which no one can tell from a little fibroma, an adeno-fibroma, a little cyst, or an inflamed lobule. But left alone that little nodule soon—much sooner than is thought—spreads its cancer cells or juices far and wide into the lymphatic system.^ An early microscopical examination—and no one can tell what that little tumour is, without one—puts all doubt at rest. If the tumour be harmless the opera- tion is quite trifling ; but if it be malignant an efficient one can be done. The diagnosis of tumours rests upon (a) clinical, (&) naked eye, and (c) microscopical characters. Even when based upon such solid foundations as these it may be profoundly modified by the ultimate fate of the patient. Of late several occurrences have shaken my behef in even the axioms of clinical surgery. What would any one think if he were told that an ossifying enchondroma had been removed from the front of the left thigh bone by sawing and chiseHing through the bony pedicle ? I venture to opine that few would think that the patient would come back in six years with a large I ' Carcinoma of the Breast and its Spread into the Lymphatics,' by C. B.

272 DIAGNOSIS OF TUMOURS away. This case exemplified another point. The cancer had grown along the palate, and it was quite impossible to tell with the naked eye where it ended. Some tissue in the roof of the mouth looked exactly like growth, and most of the palate would un- doubtedly have been removed had not Mr. Rose made an immediate microscopical section, and reported that we were looking at palatal glands. Again, an immediate microscopical examination was useful when amputating at the hip-joint for a tumour of the upper third of the femur. In Scarpa's triangle, by the side of the tumour, some enlarged lymphatic glands were felt. Others could be felt along the crural arch and within the abdomen along the external iliac vessels. The question, therefore, arose as to whether, at the time of the amputation or afterwards, these intra-abdominal glands ought or ought not to be removed. The microscope there and then showed that only the large glands upon the capsule of the tumour con- tained growth, and that those nearer the crural arch contained none, so that it was deemed unneces- sary to open the abdomen. Mr. Shaw will now demonstrate how quickly sections of growth can be cut with a freezing micro- tome, and how clear and good the sections are. In my opinion the apparatus he is using is an essential part of the equipment of an operating theatre.

THE ESSENTIALS OF A DIAGNOSIS 95 whether your minds have observed this, that that diagnosis is lacking in important particulars. When I was in charge of the venereal wards, it was some- what a surprise to some to be informed that anaemia was an essential and invariable attribute of sjrphilis. We had blood-counts made of all the patients who were in the early stages of sj^hilis, and we found invariably that there was about one million diminu- tion in the number of red blood-cells. I do not know whether the heemoglobin was estimated, but if so I have no doubt it was found to be dimin- ished also. So there, to our clinical diagnosis, we have a thread of science attached. But more still is wanting to make that a proper and complete diag- nosis. A little while ago, a patient came who, on reasonable clinical evidence, might have been supposed to have had a syphilitic sore in his urethra, where it could not easily be seen, and where it did not easily make its presence known. I thought I would see what the scientists could do to help the clinical surgeon on an occasion such as this, and therefore I sent on this patient to the bacteri- ologist and asked him to report to me on the presence or absence of the spirochaeta pallida. I had his report back saying he could not find it. Of course if the spirochseta pallida could be easily discovered it would reduce the diagnosis of syphilis under difficult circumstances to an easy matter, and it would remove it from the list of clinical diagnoses and put it into the list of scientific diagnoses, such

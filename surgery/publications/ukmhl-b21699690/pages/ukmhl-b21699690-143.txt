CARCINOMA OF THE BREAST 125 part of the axillary vein. It would not have been seen had the pectorals not been removed.^ To those who have not realized how soon and how extensively the lymphatics become involved even in the earliest stages of malignant disease, the removal of the whole mammary gland, both of the pectoral muscles, and all the axillary fat and fascia, may seem to have been an extensive procedure to adopt for a small carcinomatous ulcer of the nipple ; and yet the end justified the means. Here is another instance in which a very minute cancer was proved to be accompanied by rather extensive growth in the neighbouring lymphatics. A woman came complaining of slight occasional mucous discharge from the right nipple, which was slightly retracted. The whole of the right breast was larger than the left, but nothing unusual could be felt in it, except at the lower part of the areola. Here a very small soft nodule could with difficulty be felt. Slight pressure made this insignificant lump almost disappear, with the escape of a little mucus from the nipple. An incision brought to light a dilated duct ampulla, and the microscope there and then showed that it contained a small carcinoma. The little sac which held the growth was not more than three-quarters of an inch long and not much more than a quarter of an inch across ' On this point see also Sheild: The Results of Operation in sixty cases of Malignant Disease of the Breast.

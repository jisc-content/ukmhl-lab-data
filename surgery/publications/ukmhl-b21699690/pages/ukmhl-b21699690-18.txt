As a rule it is best to proceed in anatomical order. In a genito-urinary case begin with the urethra, then proceed with the membranous urethra, the prostatic, the bladder, ureters, and kidneys ; from the prostatic urethra proceed to investigate the prostate gland, the vas deferens vesiculse seminales, epididymis, and body of testis.' Similarly follow the alimentary tract from mouth to anus. One of the objects of an anatomical training is to enable you to work in this systematic way. If we proceed in anatomical order the super- ficial structures are examined before the deep. Thus the skin and subcutaneous tissue of the abdomen are taken before the muscles, the muscles before the peritoneum, the peritoneum before the viscera. The order of the examination may be determined by the question of pain. Thus, an inflamed joint is long looked at before being touched ; the least painful part of the touching is done first, and movement is attempted by the patient before it is attempted by the surgeon. A man's thoughtfulness and gentleness are clearly shown by the way in which he handles an inflamed joint. When a joint is inflamed, its movements depart and return in definite order. In tuberculous arthritis of the hip-joint, for instance, rotation is lost before abduc-

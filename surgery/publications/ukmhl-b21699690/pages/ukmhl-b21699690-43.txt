CLINICAL REASONING 31 also your powers of inference. You may possibly come to a correct conclusion about the nature of the case. The man in Kenton Ward has a large tumour occupying the left parotid region and the upper part of the posterior triangle of the neck upon the same side. Between the parotid tumour and the tumour in the neck there is a rather deep groove. Naturally you would say this about the case, that the patient has a tumour of the parotid gland and that the swelling below the groove in the posterior triangle of the neck is a group of enlarged glands related to the growth in the parotid gland. That would be the natural thing to say. I should have said that, if I had not a little knowledge which one derives from experience, and which could not very well have been known by the members of my class ; and it is that a parotid tumour has a curious habit of descending into the neck. I have seen a tumour almost in the anterior triangle of the neck, and low down on the sterno- mastoid, and which was a parotid tumour which had descended down the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid and lodged where it was seen in the upper part of the triangle of the neck. With that knowledge I was a little reluctant to assume that the tumour in the triangle of the neck was in the lymphatic glands. I rather inferred it was a portion of the tumour which had grown down ; that is what it was because there was complete continuity between the tumour in the parotid region itself

By use of a Httle tact and kindliness and the avoid- ance of unnecessary exposure, there is seldom any difficulty in following this rule. The second rule, which tells you to examine the whole of the diseased limb or structure, is often violated. Here is a man with a small ulcer upon the dorsum of the foot. He has had this ulcer for many years, but latterly it has grown bigger and become more painful. The base of the ulcer is hard, and adheres to the tarsal bones. I remember how much time was spent in endeavouring to tell what kind of ulcer this was, but no one knew until all the garments came off, and brought in sight a mass of enlarged, hard, and adherent glands at the base of the Scarpa's triangle.

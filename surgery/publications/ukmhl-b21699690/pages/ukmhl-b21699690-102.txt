It was treated with the necessary antitoxin, and after a dreadful illness, in which it suffered from paralysis of its ocular muscles, and, I believe, of some muscles of its limbs and the muscles of respira- tion, it recovered. Perhaps if the nature of that infection had been found out a week or ten days earlier, and if treatment by means of serum had been begun at once, it would not have gone through such a perilous illness.

Clearly, to some minds that was a diagnosis which ought to suffice, but again I requested to have clear and accurate information as to the infection which was causing the vulvitis, and the report came back again that the child was suffering from diphtheria.

Another condition which is often labelled with what is considered to be a suffi- cient name is that ordinary state known as gastritis. Not long since we had a patient in Lucas Ward who certainly exemplified the peculiar mental attitude of some towards disease and their lack of appreciation of what a diagnosis should be. That patient first came under my notice suffering from an attack of rather acute intestinal obstruction. In the Midlands she had had her abdomen opened

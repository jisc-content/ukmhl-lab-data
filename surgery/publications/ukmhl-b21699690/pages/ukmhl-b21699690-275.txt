F^CAL LEAKS AND FISTULA 257 I remember also a duodenal leak which was found to have a piece of stick in it, but it was not found until after the death of the patient. The patient had a perforation of the duodenum. And after his death from sepsis a piece of stick was found stuck in the perforation. I remember opening an abscess for a boy who had a faecal leak, and it was clear that the cause was a bristle which was in the hole in the intestine. It was removed. Had that bristle been allowed to remain, the hole could not have got well. Another patient of mine that got well of a very bad feecal leak had curious adventures. After a while a piece of thick silk, which someone had put in at a previous operation, made its appear- ance. That may have had something to do with the persistence of the fsecal leak ; but a more extraordinary thing appeared afterwards, and that was a flint half an inch or more in diameter. And it has been a constant source of wonder to me how that flint got into the alimentary canal, and what it had to do with the persistence of the fsecal leak. I have never been able to solve the problem. I cannot now say more about the treatment of fsecal leaks and fistulse, but there are a few common-sense things which I advise : first of all the patient must be kept still and recumbent. I say that because I have seen people with bad fsecal leaks who, it was thought, could get better when they were moving about in bath-chau's. Sometimes it may be wise to put the patient in a particular position, LOCKWOOD

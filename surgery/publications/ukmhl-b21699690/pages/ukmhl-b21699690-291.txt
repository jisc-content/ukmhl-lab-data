DURING COURSE OF OPERATION 273 Demonstration by Ernest H. Shaw Method of Gming Frozen Sections of Fresh Tissues for Immediate Microscopic Diagnos^s dur^ng Operations. The method may be divided into two parts : 1. The Arranging and Fixing-up of the Apparatus ^ The microtome must be fixed on a firm table and all the instruments arranged in a convenient manner. A mental survey of the cutting, mounting, and staining of a section is then made, in order to make sure that everything is present and m its proper place. This ensures that no time will be wasted when once the process is begun. _ 2 Preparation of the Microscopic Section. (a) The selected piece of tissue received from the surgeon is placed directly on to the brass disc of an ether-freezing microtome, and is surrounded by gum solution. (&) The tissue and gum are frozen, and sections made by a razor on a carrier. (c) The sections are transferred to a dish of cold water, and, after separating them with a glass rod, a suitable section is lifted out. (d) It is dipped for a moment into pure methy- lated spirit, and (e) Then placed in another larger dish ot cold LOCKWOOD

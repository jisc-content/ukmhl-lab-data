114 INFECTION OP LYMPHATIC GLANDS other side of the tongue, and I will explain what happened in the case originally mentioned. You will see that there are lingual lymphatics which run from the tip towards the fraenum of the tongue and empty into a lymphatic gland which is situated underneath the mental process of the lower jaw (vide Fig. 2, j). That is the sub-mental gland. Think of removing the tip of the tongue for an epithelioma and forgetting to examine carefully under the mental process to see if the mental gland was enlarged. In removing enlarged lymphatic glands from the neck I always make my incision so that I shall be able to get at that gland. I imitate Mr. Butlin and turn back a flap with its apex at the mental process and its base at the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid, and I do not think I have quite done my duty until I have looked at the sub-mental gland not only on the affected side but also on the opposite side. It is easy to get at them, and it is an essential step in the operation. I am now coming to another gland. Take the lymphatics in the middle third of the tongue. You know, lying on the side of that, is the sub-lingual salivary gland. I am not concerned with the salivary glands at the present moment. I am speaking now of a gland which lies on the hyoglossus lower down, and it lies close to the posterior edge of the muscle forming the floor of the mouth (vide Fig. 2, e). The floor of the mouth is formed by the mylohyoid, which is sometimes called the diaphragm of the mouth.

G6 INTRA-ABDOMINAL INFLAMMATION in order to ascertain the progress or otherwise of the case, you should take only a few hours. If the patient is getting worse, you will have some deter- minant symptom to tell you so, and that will be your guide as to whether there should be operation or not. You may have observed, in the two lectures I have given you, that I have not mentioned any details of operative surgery. My reasons for this omission are simple. To order an operation in the case of grave abdominal disease is very much the same as ordering a dose of medicine, and upon my word it often requires just as much general know- ledge and as much trained judgement to order a dose of calomel for a person with serious abdo- minal disease as it does to order an exploratory incision. You will see plenty of operations per- formed, and my advice to you is to give the greatest possible care and attention to that which goes before the operation and to that which comes after itâ€”that is to say, the preliminary diagnosis and the subsequent treatment.

100 THE ESSENTIALS OF A DIAGNOSIS were not seen in his urine because the tubercles were not yet softened, and so no bacilli had passed into the urine. Later on he got most acute and severe tuberculous ulcers of the bladder, tubercle of the prostate, and tubercle of the vesiculae semi- nales, and ultimately of his kidneys, and died of this dreadful, and I venture to say preventible, disease. Another instrument of precision which has altered our views very much, or ought to have so done, is the separator. There are various forms of separa- tors to separate the urine of the kidneys. We had a most instructive example of the value of that a little while ago, because a patient was sent up with a diagnosis of stone in her left kidney. The stone was said to be in her left kidney, and I think anybody would have accepted that diagnosis as being correct, because her left kidney was enlarged and very tender ; but if she had stone in her left kidney it seemed to me to be important to know, not only what was going on in her left kidney, but also whether her right kidney was competent to carry her through such a severe operation as nephro- lithotomy. An X-ray photograph was made, and that revealed the fact that she had a stone in the left kidney and also a very large one in the right kidney. Therefore, this was the position of things : stones had to be removed from both kidneys. And if so, both at the same time ? Or if one, which one ? We proceeded in the following way with this new

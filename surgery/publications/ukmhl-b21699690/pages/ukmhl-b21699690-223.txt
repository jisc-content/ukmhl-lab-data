205 SCROTAL SWELLINGS chronic. The acute tuberculous testis is usually, as the name implies, painful, rapid in its increase in size, and attended with considerable inflammation. It soon begins to soften in various parts and if left alone it begins to ulcerate. The swelling may be ovoid, but it is sure to be accompanied with con- siderable thickening and tenderness of the cord in the neck of the scrotum, perhaps passing up into the inguinal canal. When you operate upon such a case as that you will find that the spermatic cord, where you divide it, is oedematous, and perhaps has areas of caseous degeneration in it. The testicle itself is a huge inflammatory mass full of caseous lumps or nodules, and which are in the process of softening, and also threatening the ulceration that I have mentioned. So it becomes a question what you should do with such a testicle, because it is only a part of the general tuberculosis. Patients with that condition have got a high temperature and perhaps advanced tubercle in the lungs or else- where, and it is doubtful whether it is worth while to remove the testicle or not. I am in favour of removing such testicles on the ground of humanity. First of all, the removal of a testicle of that descrip- tion causes singularly little shock or illness to the patients. They take the anaesthetic well if it is properly given. The removal of the testicle is a great mental and physical relief. You can imagine how painful it must be to possess a huge inflamed heavy testicle which is on the point of degeneration

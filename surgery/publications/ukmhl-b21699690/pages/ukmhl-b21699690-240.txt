In a proportion of cases exploration does good rather than harm, although nothing further can be done. The escape of the fluid relieves the heart and diaphragm. Indeed, the breathing and the circulation may be impeded to such an extent that the fluid must be got rid of. I advise that this be done by an incision rather than a puncture, for then a double end is gainedâ€”the fluid is evacuated, and the disease diagnosed and possibly cured. For instance, a lady had been thrice tapped for ascites. I guessed that she might after all be suffering from papillomatous growths of the ovaries and advised that next time the fluid accumulated it should be removed by incision, so that this diagnosis might be verified. Each ovary was a mass of papilloma and had a long and thin pedicle. The patient was quite well four years after the operation. Some might think that in cases of ascites incision is more dangerous than puncture ; but this I am inclined to doubt. I have been twice called upon to stop alarming haemorrhage after puncture, and once I have seen the haemorrhage speedily fatal. Sometimes the fluid does not reaccumulate after laparotomy, or there is a long pause before its reaccumulation. I can recall several cases in which it has not been necessary to do anything further for the removal of the fluid. Some may have

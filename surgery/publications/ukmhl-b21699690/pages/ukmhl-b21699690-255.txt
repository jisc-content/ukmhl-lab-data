F^CAL LEAKS AND FISTULA 237 weighed towards the belief that the fluid was urine and therefore came from the unobliterated urachus. Various attempts were made to obHterate this leak or channel. Anaesthetics were given and the channel was burned. I want to draw your atten- tion very particularly to this point because, per- haps, you may not have learnt that it is almost impossible to obliterate the whole of the mucous lining of any tract or duct. I believe it to be an impossible task, and therefore if that is true it is not surprising that I and others were absolutely unable to destroy the mucous lining of that from which this child was suffering, so that in the end a set operation had to be performed ; and one of the first steps in the operation was to open the peritoneal cavity, and then it was easy to see what one had to deal with—namely, a Meckel's diverti- culum passing down towards the ileum, not far from the ceecum.

INGUINAL SWELLINGS a patient coughs it should close, and squeeze out the tip of your finger, which means that its boun- daries are strong and taut, and not weak and flaccid. You can infer from what I have said that if you pass your finger up the external abdominal ring into the canal, that that is an abnormal canal. Well, I have often operated and explored canals of that sort and found nothing in them, but I am always very suspicious when the external ring is large enough to admit the index finger and enable me to explore freely with my finger the inguinal canal. The next structure which you ought, I think, to be clear about after the inguinal canal is the contents of the scrotum. What should you feel in the scro- tum ? Sometimes the scrotum contains swellings which are not testicles, but which are mistaken for testicles because the examiner is careless. But unless you can feel the spermatic cord coming down to join the epididymis, and unless in front of the epididymis you can feel the elastic body of the testicle, you should be careful what you say about it. Also, in the scrotum you may be able to feel the pampiniform plexus with a certain amount of ease. But, because you can feel the veins, it does not necessarily follow that you should diagnose a varicocele. Where the normal pampiniform plexus ends and varicocele begins I cannot tell you. But you must not condemn everybody as having vari- cocele if their pampiniform plexus is fairly easy to feel. Assuming all this is clear in your minds, I will

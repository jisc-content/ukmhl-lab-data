FiECAL LEAKS AND FISTULA 255 digested the abdominal wall. And it had not a very strong odour. So I suspect it was a leak high up especially as when charcoal was given by the mouth it speedily came through. If that is true, then the leak wiU be very difficult to deal with^ The two leaks which gave passage to fascal tiuid should be easier, for one of them has closed and the other is closing. I do not suppose this leakage higher up will get well without some formidable opCTation for its cure. So, clearly, it is important to look at the kind of discharge which comes out. Next, it is very important to look at the aperture. We had a little boy the other day in Kenton Ward who had had an appendix operation performed. It was compHcated by hsematoma and abscess, and then he was left with a small sinus which was surrounded by a ring of what might have been either granulations or mucous membrane. This was removed, and it was found on microscopical examination to be mucous membrane. I have already told you what bearing this mucous lining has upon the question of treatment. And so his abdomen was opened again, and it was found that the stump of his appendix had protruded through the centre of the wound and become fastened there. This was treated in the ordinary way and got well. So if you are brought into contact with a faecal leak or fistula, make sure whether or not it is lined with mucous membrane. If it is, your prospects of curing it will not be very bright without a proper operation.

IN DISEASE OF THE TONGUE 109 an epithelioma, I have often observed that students were not clear upon one fundamental point. One asks, ' Has that man got epithelioma ?' The answer is yes. Why ? Because he has got an ulcer with undermined edges, or something of that kind. But have not you a better reason than that ? The reason is that he has got a tumour, and until you can satisfy yourself that he has got a growth how can you say that he has got an epitheliomatous growth or an epithelioma, or that he has got an ingrowth of epithelial tissue ? He must have a tumour ; and you must be able to recognize that tumour in its very early stages. If you do not, the growth of it is inevitable ; its extension is inevitably along the lymphatic channels, and there will be a fatal ending unless you diagnose it soon. So your responsibilities are very great in this respect. How would you proceed if the tumour were very small and the ulcer slight ? Remember it is so important to diagnose it early. In the out-patient department you must have seen how we proceed over and over again. A little cocaine is put on the edge of the ulcer, and a piece snipped off and examined microscopically. Think if you diagnose epithelioma in its early stages how much simpler and safer the operation becomes. At this early stage a portion of the tongue can be cut out wide of the disease, and in the early stages the mouth can be properly prepared, and if the opera- tion is well managed the wound can be closed, and.

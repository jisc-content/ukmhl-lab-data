DURING COURSE OF OPERATION 269 enlarged lymphatic glands in a child's neck which were thought sarcomatous proved to be tuberculous, and were removed on both sides with a reasonable prospect of success. . , j- â€ž The naked-eye and also the microscopical diag- nosis of enlarged glands is sometimes exceedingly difficult, perhaps impossible. A labourer had enlarged glands along both carotid sheaths, ihere was much difference of opinion when the micro- scopical sections were looked at as to whether the appearances were those of inflammation or of malignant disease. Acting upon my own opmion I removed the glands, for I thought they were inflamed, which proved to be the case. The cause of the inflammation or the kind of inflammation was never known. But the case shows how impor- tant it is that the operator should himself be able to interpret for himself the appearances seen in microscopical sections, for otherwise the operation would, on this and other occasions, have been abandoned. Another case illustrated very well the difficulties by which the clinical diagnosis of enlarged lymphatic glands is enmeshed. A man had a mass of enlarged and obviously inflamed lymphatic glands beneath the right sterno-cleido-mastoideus. One of the largest of the glands fluctuated and was presumably suppurating. When exposed they looked like inflamed glands, and the fluid which escaped looked like pus; but the microscope brought to light

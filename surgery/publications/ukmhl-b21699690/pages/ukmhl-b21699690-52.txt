In this instance I said, ' We can explore the lump upon the angle of the tenth rib, and if that proves to be a mere septic periostitis, it is reasonable to go on and see what has taken place in the gall- bladder. But if that lump on the tenth rib proves to be of a different kind, we shall still know what we ought and'what we ought not to do.' An anes- thetic was given and I made a cut down on the rib. It was quite dramatic. First of all, the lump to the naked eye was obviously inflamed. When touched it fluctuated, and on being opened a fluid like pus came out. By means of the finger bare bone was felt, but it was red. A piece of the wall of that apparent abscess was given to Mr. Shaw, and in three minutes I saw the most perfect speci- men of columnar-celled carcinoma I ever saw in my life. How did she become infected with carci- noma ? I say infected because one cannot help feeling that it was so.

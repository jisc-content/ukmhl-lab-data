60 INTRA-ABDOMINAL INFLAMMATION times the vomiting may be a determinant feature. There are degrees of vomiting. I take vomiting in its anatomical order. If a person merely vomits the contents of the stomach, it is clear that the vomiting is not of a very severe character. If he vomits up the contents of the duodenum—that is to say, if the vomited matter contains bile—it is more severe. If it begins to get down to that black material which inhabits the jejunum, it is a decidedly serious form of vomiting, and is of great import. I suppose some people will proceed to allow vomiting to go on to such a degree that at last it gets to the contents of the ileum, in which case it is called fsecal. I do not think to-day such a thing would occur, but I have known practitioners who have said, ' I did not think it necessary to send for you before because the vomiting had not become fsecal.' I will not refer to the next alteration of function, namely distension, but you know the function of the intestines, besides dealing with the contents, is to propel them. Inflamed structures do not perform their functions properly, and if the intestines do not propel their contents there will be distension and intestinal obstruction, which are inevitable. I wonder if any one can teU me where the intestinal gases come from. Obviously they are manufactured by the intestinal bacteria. If you grow the colon bacillus in gelatin, you will find over each colony a little balloon of gas, and if you can carry your mind to countless millions

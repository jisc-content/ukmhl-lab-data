F^CAL LEAKS AND FISTULA 259 I performed a very large operation, removing the ventral hernia, together with the loop of the intes- tine attached to it, including the leak in it. After this the two ends of the ileum were closed and the proximal end was united by lateral anastomosis to the colon. The patient survived the operation and is now cured. Clearly there is one other point to consider. It is hopeless to operate upon faecal leaks which are associated with diseases such as tubercle, actinomycosis, or carcinoma, unless you remove the whole disease, and, of course, this may mean a very formidable surgical proceeding. Attempts to close fiscal leaks are most dangerous operations â€”dangerous because, whoever the surgeon is, there is one element outside his control, and that is sepsis. s 2

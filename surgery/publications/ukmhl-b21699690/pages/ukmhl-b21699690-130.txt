116 INFECTION OF LYMPHATIC GLANDS against your finger. You must have something to push it against. I want to draw attention to another thing in connexion with secondary infection from maHgnant disease of the tongue. In Poirier's book, which is really a most admirable work, there is an explana- tion of a fact which I was aware of, and had observed clinically, and have had borne in upon me in operating for removal of tumours of malignant character in the neck. In one part of this book there is a picture of the lymphatic glands of the neck. I cannot show you specimens because there are none in the Museum, but if some individual here will produce some proper specimens of lymphatics for the Museum they will be invaluable to him and to those who come afterwards. In this picture there is shown a lymphatic channel arising from the tongue and running down over the hyoid bone, and passing down over the thyroid cartilage^ (vide Fig. 3, g, and Fig. 2, I and h). It is depicted making a loop, which lymphatics sometimes do, and empty- ing itself in a lymphatic gland opposite the cricoid cartilage. This gland is usually situated upon the carotid artery opposite the cricoid cartilage, and at the place where the omohyoid crosses the common carotid artery. See how easily you might have been 1 As this loop crosses the ala of the thyroid cartilage it sometimes has a small lymphatic gland in the midst of its course. In cancer I have seen this enlarged, and easily felt it against the ala of the thyroid cartilage.

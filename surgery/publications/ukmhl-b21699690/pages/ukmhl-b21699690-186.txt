VARICOSE VEINS 168 was wound round the limb, bringing the wound together. I tried it on many occasions, but found that on applying the bandage the small wound was not accurately brought together, and in addition sometimes when the bandage was taken off the wound either was gaping and had to heal up by granulation, or it gaped after the bandage was taken off. So obviously if that is true it is wise, after making the cut and tying the vein, to bring the wound together Avith a continuous suture of fine silk. It used to be said that if you operate upon the varicose veins and tie them, then the blood has to return by the deeper veins, or that other superficial veins have to dilate to carry the blood back. I have kept on saying that I believe the blood in these varicose veins is stagnating, and in removing the varicose veins you are removing veins full of stagnant blood. There is no blood to go back by other tracks. And my experience of operations upon varicose veins has been that, in subjects which have been properly chosen and thoroughly operated upon, the results have been exceedingly good, not from my point of view, but from the point of view of the patient. I have forgotten to tell you what I believe to be the most essential part of the operation for varicose veins, and that is, before you perform the operation to make the patient stand up in a good light and sit down before him, and mark out every possible vein that he thinks is a trouble

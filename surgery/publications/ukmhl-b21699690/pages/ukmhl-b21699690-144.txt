126 CARCINOMA OF THE BREAST its widest part. The minute growth projected into this from a small area of its wall. The whole of the mammary gland and the pectoral fascia were then removed. A subsequent micro- scopical examination showed that this was necessary, because—as I suspected—the gland contained other commencing duct carcinomata, although none could be seen with the naked eye. The tumour beneath the areola—the only one which was known to exist when the operation was done—seemed too small and too immature to have yet spread into the neighbouring lymphatic glands; besides, it was enclosed within the walls of the ampulla. Never- theless, the axilla was explored, although no enlarge- ment of its lymphatic glands could be seen or felt. Rather to my surprise, several enlarged ones were met with, and the microscope there and then revealed that they contained duct carcinoma. I removed as much of the axHlary fat and lymphatic glands as could be done without taking the pectorals away. But on consideration, I regret now that those muscles were not removed. Without that step it is impossible to reach the lymphatic glands about the uppermost part of the axillary vein. These, as I shall presently describe, may become cancerous as soon as, or sooner than, those lower down. Thus, in the smallest carcinoma of the breast that I have ever seen, the neighbouring lymphatics were already cancerous. They prob- ably had in them deposits which taken together

CARCINOMA OF 1^HE BREAST 149 and forty minutes to clear the axilla and posterior triangle. The subclavian veins and artery had to be removed to get away the fixed mass. The operation was well borne, but the patient died three months afterwards without any local recurrence, but with evidences of growth in the osseous system. Dr. Casey informs me that in the house in which this patient lived her grandmother had died of abdominal cancer, and her grandfather of cancer of the lip. Sometimes, too, these immovable glands are not so fixed as they seem to be. A woman, who nine months before had had the left breast amputated for carcinoma, had a large gland apparently adherent to the head of the left clavicle, behind the attach- ment of the sterno-cleido-mastoid muscle. When that muscle had been reflected the gland was easily removed. She lived for more than three years, but at last died of cancer. The subclavian lym- phatic glands were not enlarged, so that it is not easy to tell how the growth had got into that solitary gland almost in the upper aperture of the thorax : probably by some unrecognized short-circuit. Finally, I doubt whether any rules can be laid down for these operations in cervical cancer. That question has to be weighed and considered and decided for each individual case.

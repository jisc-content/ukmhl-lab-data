F^CAL LEAKS AND FISTULiE 251 teach us wisdom. Here I was quite right about the diagnosis of the disease ; I was right m toie- telhng the f^cal leak or fistula ; but I was totally ianorant of the kind of tubercle with which I had to deal On December 3rd, Dr. Hartmann, of Pans, read an essay upon ileo-csecal tuberculosis, and he showed a picture of a specimen which was the exact counterpart of the one which I unfortunately fell across. The patient in my case had this condition. The leak was at the back of the caecum, and there was hyperplastic tuberculous inflammation of the cc^cum and right colon. That had led to a stricture of the right colon. I was not aware of its presence, because my finger had not felt a stricture. I could not see it from the outside because the cacum was involved in much inflammatory material, which I thought was part of the peritoneal inflammation which had been associated with the original tubercle. When I closed up the leak at the back of the caecum I closed up the only aperture by which f^ces could escape, and obviously the con- sequence was that the patient died of acute in- testinal obstruction. The only chance she had was for my sutures to give way. I have not time to proceed further with the question of tubercle, except to say that you will find a very good essay on the subject of this form of tubercle by Mr. Stoney, in the Lancet of July 29th, 1905, p. 287. Actinomycosis is another trap for the unwary.

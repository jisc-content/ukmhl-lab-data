Our course was clear as to which kidney to operate on. I removed as rapidly as I possibly could a stone from the left kidney. No special efforts were made to tie small vessels or to close the wound. In about a quarter of an hour the patient was taken from the theatre and put back to bed. She got over that crisis, and afterwards came back to have the stone removed from her right kidney. You are aware that an operation upon any kidney may make it strike work and cease to secrete urea. So if her left kidney had not begun to excrete then it was very perilous to operate upon the right. Under such circumstances it might have been better surgery to have left the stone in the right kidney. However, after again passing the separator we found the left kidney had begun to function again and was passing a reasonable quantity of urine, and in that urine a reasonable quantity of urea, and so we proceeded to remove the stone from the right kidney, and she got well. I venture to present this to you as a very excellent example of the influence of new methods of diagnosis upon your ideas of what a diagnosis should be. Now, what conclusion may be drawn from the

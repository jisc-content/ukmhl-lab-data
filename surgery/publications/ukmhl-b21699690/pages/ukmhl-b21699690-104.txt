We had yet to find out what was the cause of this dilatation of the stomach, and perhaps inflammation of the mucous membrane lining it, and then it was dis- covered that she was addicted to the abuse of alcohol, and that she had the condition which every one is aware is a consequence thereof. Cystitis is another word which is often supposed to connote disease. It used to be thought, and perhaps is still thought, to be sufficient to say, ' So-and-so, who has a high temperature, an accelerated pulse, pain over the bladder, great frequency of micturition, and pus, and perhaps blood in the urine, is suffer- ing from cystitis,' and there the matter is often allowed to rest.

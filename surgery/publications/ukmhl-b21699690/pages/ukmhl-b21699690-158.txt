I am inclined to think, on clinical grounds, that this may be too small a proportion. Disease may more readily disclose lymphatic channels than any method of injection, even than the excel- lent one of Gerota. Although after the removal of the pectorals it is rather the exception than the rule to find the uppermost axillary glands enlarged without any enlargement of the pectoral ones: nevertheless, it is by no means unusual to find them by far the biggest. This may, of course, be capable of other explanations, but one cannot help thinking that they must have got an early and independent supply of cancer short-circuited to them by a separate channel. I may say that enlarged glands are not commonly met with superficial to the costo-coracoid membrane. Once, however, I met with a large mass Ijring upon it, and on several other occasions I had encountered two or three. Enlarged cancerous glands may be met with in rather unexpected places. For instance, in a very advanced case one was found outside the coracoid process beneath the interval between the pectoralis major and deltoid. This gland was situated upon one of the trunks which collect lymph from the arm. According to Poirier^ it was first described by Aubry, who says one, two, or three may be

INTRA-ABDOMINAL INFLAMMATION 53 sits in a draughty water-closet, and then walks back to bed, you cannot get the proper reading. It is clear that such a patient should use the bed-pan when the bowels act, which entails a skilful nurse. You may be tempted to say that these are trivialities, but they constitute correct medical practice. For several days the boy's pulse and temperature were normal, and then suddenly the pulse gave a jump, and simultaneously the temperature went up. Being in bed and properly nursed gave us another opportunity of investigating this boy ; we knew what went into him, and we saw what came out. There came out a quantity of mucus streaked with blood. Therefore it was clear that he had something odd going on in his colon. He had colitis, whatever else he had. We watched him for nearly three weeks. A friend of mine (Dr. John Harold) looked after him, and one day he said, ' Come and see that boy.' I went up to see him. And we said, ' You have a pain, have you not ? ' ' Yes.' ' Where is it ? ' ' It is here, on the right side.' Altogether, he had been going on in this way with these ' bilious attacks ' for six years ; his abdomen was opened, and an inflamed appendix was extracted from behind his colon. That ulcerated and septic appendix was full of fsecal concretions. I guess that that boy had had an escape. But why did he get that dreadfully dangerous appendix removed? Simply because he was put on what I strongly recommend for these patients with doubtful conditions, a period of probation.

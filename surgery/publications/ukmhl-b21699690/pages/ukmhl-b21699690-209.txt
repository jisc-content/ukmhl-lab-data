INGUINAL SWELLINGS 191 mind as to whether you believe it or not. I am rather sceptical, so I disbelieve it. Next, cannot the testicles be brought down ? It is highly improbable, because if they are in the iliac fossa the cord is too short. If they were in the inguinal canal, the cord might be long enough to let them come down into the scrotum. If that were to be done, if they were to be got down in that way, would the testicles then develop ? Nobody can answer that. But there are a great many curious, interesting, and important questions which arise concerning tumours and swellings in the in- guinal canal such as we have been considering to-day. I think next week I will proceed to consider with you the swellings in the neck of the scrotum, and the swellings in the scrotum itself, because quite recently we have had some swellings in the scrotum and in the neck of the scrotum, which have been of the most perplexing and curious character ; and as you, gentlemen, are attending the out-patients' department and the wards, you will be constantly brought into contact with cases such as those we have been considering. I shall be interested to know from any of you whether I am correct in my statement that that important disease, inguinal varicocele, is not mentioned in the ordinary text- books. And if not, you may take it as a warning and remember that the best textbooks are the patients in the out-patient rooms and wards of the hospital.

The next step in the operation was to search a little fm-ther from the edge of the swelling and open the general peritoneal cavity, where the intestines could be properly identified. And after this had been done I succeeded in lifting up the intestines from the iliac fossa, and, pushing my finger towards the back of the caecum, I opened an appendicular abscess. It was drained and treated in the usual manner. As you might expect, an intestinal opening which was sutured whilst it was acutely inflamed, and whilst the intestine was embedded in lymph, was not very likely to hold. So in a few days' time the intestinal contents began to leak through the opening. The case has a certain bearing upon what would be your ordinary course of treatment of such an opening.

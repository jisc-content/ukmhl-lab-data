CARCINOMA OF THE BREAST 131 by Stiles ^ in his admirable essay. My colleague, Dr. F. W. Andrewes, one of the most accurate of pathologists, allows me to say that he quite agrees that in cancer of the breast the axillary glands are sometimes enlarged without showing any micro- scopic evidence of cancer, and he adds that it is impossible to assert positively that cancer is absent from a given gland without examining serial sections of the entire gland, several thousand sections in numberâ€”which is practically impossible. But the ordinary routine methods give, he thinks, a fair presumption of the absence of cancer. Here is some additional evidence upon the same point. The left breast, pectorals, axillary fascia, and axillary contents were removed for carcinoma. The axillary lymphatic glands were sent for examina- tion. Mr. Ernest Shaw, whose histological skill is acknowledged, reported that the large glands did not contain cancer, but that some minute ones did. This, too, Mr. Shaw tells me, is an ordinary experience. Mr. Bilton Pollard,- during his very successful operations for cancer of the intestine, had a similar experience. But here another thing may have happened. As every one knows, the almost inevit- able course of cancer is growth, degeneration, ulceration, and sepsis. In Mr. Pollard's cases the form of carcinoma was ^ The Surgical Anatomy of the Breast and Axillary Lymphatic Glands, &c.

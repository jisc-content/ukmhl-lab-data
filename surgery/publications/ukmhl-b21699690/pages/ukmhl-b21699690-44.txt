In looking at the whole of it it is very important that you should reason anatomically ; the important points would be overlooked if you did not. For instance, in the parotid region, besides the blood-vessels which pass through the parotid gland there is a very important nerveâ€”the nerve of expression, the facial nerve. Many members of my class did not observe that the man had facial paralysis. If one of the class had proceeded to operate, and had removed the tumour, and had not observed the left^ facial paralysis, or the patient's friends had noticed it after the operation, what would the position have been ? They would have said, ' In' removing this tumour you have done it badly, because you have divided the facial nerve.' As a matter of fact it had been destroyed before; during an attempt which had been made to remove the growth. There is another important matter in connexion with that man. The tumour of the parotid gland may pass along the prolongations of the parotid gland, especially the portion which inhabits the parotid fossa. He could not open his mouth very well, so perhaps the tumour had passed into the glenoid lobe of the parotid gland. Also the tumour was exceedingly fixed, as if it was anchored by some prolongation. But if this growth was malignant it might have penetrated in various

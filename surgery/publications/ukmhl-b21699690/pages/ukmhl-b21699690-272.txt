In fact I am not sure that you might not say, ' the nearer the stomach the more difficult to cure.' I believe you can say, ' the nearer the anus the more easy to cure.' I believe it is almost true ; at all events there is an element of truth in it. I regret to say—and you may have observed it from my first remarks—I have not received very good assistance from the pathologists in the diag- nosis of the situation of intestinal leaks. For instance, with regard to the child with a congenital leak at the umbilicus, the dispute was whether the discharge was urine or not ? Two opinions led rather towards urine coming out. But recently I have seen a patient who has three intestinal leaks. I will not go into his history. He had had opera- tions performed for them.

It often leads to the administra- tion of opium or morphia. When a human being is in agony it may seem hard to withhold relief, but the narcotic is sure to accelerate the onset of the intestinal paralysis and gaseous distension. The pain ought to be relieved by the division of the band, the withdrawal of the intussusception, or the evacuation of the abscess. In the examination of a case of intestinal obstruc- tion it is of course helpful to have in the memory a classification of its possible causes. An anatomical classification, such as is usually given, may be of use in the arrangement of museum specimens, but is not very serviceable at the bedside. My own experience has led me to classify the causes of intestinal obstruction intoâ€”(1) mechanical, (2) inflammatory, (3) paralytic, (4) vascular. The last is the only division of which nothing has yet been said. Once I performed laparotomy for acute intestinal obstruction, and found thrombosis of the mesenteric veins. On another occasion the mesen- teric arteries seemed to be at fault, having possibly become filled with clot. But even such a simple classification as this has to be used with caution. Take such a case as the following, and one neither unusual nor imaginary. A young woman was suddenly seized with violent abdominal pain,

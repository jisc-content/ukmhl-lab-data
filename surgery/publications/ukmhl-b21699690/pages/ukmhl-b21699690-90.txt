78 RECOGNITION AND MANAGEMENT OF a complication of intestinal obstruction. Early, severe, continuous vomiting is seen in cases which run a rapidly fatal course. Its presence prohibits procrastination. I have seen the worst vomiting in cases of acutely strangulated umbilical hernia, the obstruction being high up in the jejunum, and very acute. Indeed, in such a case I had in 1898 to resect a gangrenous loop of bowel. The strangu- lation had probably lasted seventy hours. In spite of the unfavourable circumstances the patient recovered. Vomiting, too, was acute and persistent in the case of a young man who had a loop of ileum strangulated to gangrene beneath an adherent vermiform appendix. About forty hours of strangu- lation sufficed for the death of the gut, which had to be resected. A fatal result ensued on the fourth day. The cause was not ascertained. Likewise in volvulus of the small intestine—a rare event— I have seen early and continuous vomiting. In all of these instances the mere obstruction is not the only cause of vomiting; the injury to the intestinal walls and mesentery and their nerve- supply is a factor, and helps to explain its sudden and violent onset. Vomiting is a marked feature of a class of intes- tinal obstruction which in my experience is very common, namely, that which is caused by acute suppurative or non-suppurative peritonitis. Here, again, it is an indication of the dangerous severity of that which is causing the obstruction.

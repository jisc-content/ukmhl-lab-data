INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION 71 of flatus ensued, and afterwards Drs. Coleman and Colby completely succeeded in relieving the obstruc- tion. I have notes of obstruction complicating paralysis agitans in a man seventy-six years of age. It was relieved by the long tube and enemas. Indeed, these measures may be more efficacious than colo- tomy in this class of case. For instance, a woman with secondary growths in the liver and peritoneum after carcinoma of the breast was dying of intestinal obstruction. I performed inguinal colotomy, but this gave incomplete relief, and she died on the fourth day. Afterwards no trace of a mechanical cause was discovered. I believe that enemas given skilfully may be considered a test of the presence or absence of intestinal obstruction ; when they fail, surgery is the next resort. As regards the composition of the enema, it will be found that soap and water mixed with turpentine and castor oil is very efficacious. The ingredients are easy to obtamâ€”glycerine may be added, or sulphate of magnesia. In a case of obstruction following the opening of a large acute appendicular abscess, and in which the obstruction was known to be due to peritonitis and not to mechanical causes, an enema of soap and water, castor oil, turpentine, and three drops of croton oil succeeded when everything else had failed. Croton oil is very effectual, but only justifiable when it is known that there is no mechanical obstruction.

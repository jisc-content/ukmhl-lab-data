CLINICAL REASONING 35 it came from the left kidney ; so before pro- ceeding to perform nephrectomy, which is a serious operation, further evidence was required, and it would be necessary to examine the patient under an anesthetic to see what both kidneys were doing. The patient was given a dose of methylene blue. I confess not to be very learned in regard to methlyene blue, but if you take methylene blue the kidney epithelium selects it from the blood and passes it out into the urine. Obviously, if on one side or the other of the body you have not kidney substance which is working, that side will not pick methylene blue out of the blood. The first thing which happened under an anaesthetic in this case was that the endoscope showed that the mouth of the left ureter —that is to say, the one we are speaking about— was red. You may look upon the mouth of the ureter as a sort of optic disc of the kidney—that is to say, that the ureter bears the same relation to the kidney as the optic disc does to the brain. You are aware that when it is some question of disease of the brain—I am putting it into very popular language—you may see the end of the brain in the eye, for the end of the optic nerve is, develop- mentally, a prolongation of the brain. If that looks red and inflamed, it is a fair inference that the brain is red and inflamed also. If it is swollen and full of venous blood, you may assume that the brain also is full of venous blood.

INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION 83 bowel, or by pelvic inflammation, is not likely to yield to measures such as these. Surgery ought to step in without delay. When the administration of an anaesthetic has been decided upon, then proper preparations should be made for the performance of an operation. As I have already said, the gravity of the operation depends in a large degree upon the stage at which it is performed. In the absence of distension the abdomen can be systematically explored and the seat of the obstruction accurately ascertained. Accurate knowledge upon this point is of essential importance. Should the distension be so great as to prevent a proper examination, then I believe it is justifiable to extrude the dis- tended intestines through the median incision, and empty them of their feecal contents. After this has been done a proper search becomes possible. This ought to be conducted in a routine manner ; first the ileo-csecal junction, then the colon, sigmoid flexure, and lastly the small intestines. Sometimes collapsed intestine at once comes into view, and is a guide to the seat of obstruction. I have been entirely deceived by trusting to mere distension of the intestine as a guide to the seat of obstruction. Once it was assumed that the obstruction was high in the rectum ; the sigmoid flexure was exposed, found distended with gas, and fixed in the abdominal wound and opened. Gas and a little f^cal matter escaped, but it was afterwards ascertained that the obstruction was due to volvulus of the small intestine. G 2

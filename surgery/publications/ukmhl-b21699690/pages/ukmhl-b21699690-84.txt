In addition, there is less chance of introducing air, which, of course, would return, and be likely to mislead.

I have learnt to look upon this as a most hazardous and dangerous proceeding, and a grave complication of surgical measures. By increasing the peristalsis of the intestines, purgatives excite pain and turmoil, and may increase the vomiting and exhaustion ; the violent peristalsis which they excite is more likely to aggravate the effects of a mechanical obstruction than to overcome it; next, they fill the intestines above the obstruction with fluid and gaseous contents, and aggravate the abdominal distension ; and lastly, they are a source of peril when the obstruction is reheved by operation.

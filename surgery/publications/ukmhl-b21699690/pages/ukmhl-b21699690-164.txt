This brings us to another point—what ought to be done when carcinoma has spread to the cervical glands ? I believe that opinions vary upon this point. Some take a pessimistic view, consider the patient doomed, and refrain from operating ; others do not shrink from very extensive dissections of t}li.c neck But, after all, the dissection of the posterior triangle of the neck is not a very formidable under- taking for either the patient or the surgeon.

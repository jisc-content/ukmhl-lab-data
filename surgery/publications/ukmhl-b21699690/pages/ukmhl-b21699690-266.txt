218 Â¥MCAL LEAKS AND FTSTUL.E cancer, cither never get well at all or are most difficult to cure by operation. Now with regard to the cases which are due to acute infective inflammations, I might, without very much exertion, detail to you a considerable number. Some time since, in April, a boy, who was, I think, in Harley Ward, had had an acute appendicular abscess opened. After the operation the discharge became fsecal, and after a while it ceased again: what I should myself have antici- pated under the circumstances. I remember operat- ing upon a Dutch gentleman, who had a very acute abscess with a gangrenous appendix. And I saw on the end of the ileum several dark patches which looked like gangrenous patches, and after the operation one could see this piece of ileum in his wound and a ftecal discharge coming from three or four small apertures in it. I remember his relatives and friends were greatly alarmed as to the ultimate result of this, but I felt sure, from my experience of these leaks due to acute infective disease, that they would get well, and they did. I have seen some enormous leaks into the csecum and right colon get quite well when they have been caused by an acute infective disease. I can recall one patient who was under my care, and I should think the whole contents of the intestine came through the leak for many months. But she was assured she would get well, and ultimately she did, and has remained perfectly well. Have you observed

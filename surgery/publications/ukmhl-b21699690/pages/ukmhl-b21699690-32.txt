20 AN INTEODUCTTON TO THE ment. When the bones are at fault, the comparison of opposite sides is all-important, and may prevent serious blunders. I remember being shown the trapezium tubercle on the spine of the scapula, by a man of long experience. He had taken it for an exostosis, until the corresponding tubercle on the other scapula had been pointed out. When the bones are in question, it is wise to have an X-ray photograph taken. Both sides of the body ought to be photographed for comparison, because the shadow picture is so apt to mislead. A curious instance of misconception happened once. A man injured his hip. An X-ray photograph was taken, and as the neck of the femur on the injured side was so much shorter than the other, an impacted fracture of the neck of the femur was diagnosed. The photographer had omitted to observe that on the sound side, owing to the position of his lamp, a longer shadow had been cast by the rami of the pubes, the ilium, the neck of the femur, and by the shaft of the femur, which looked twice its proper width. This made the injured side seem too short ; as a matter of fact in the photograph it was the right length, and the opposite side was too long. Opposite sides of the body should be compared in feeling the arteries, testing the conductivity of the nerves, or the strength of muscles ; hereafter you will learn to compare the eyes, the ears, the nostrils, and in truth all the paired organs. Insist upon seeing what passes from the body.

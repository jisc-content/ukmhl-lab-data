U2 CARCINOMA OF TOE BREAST belongs, therefore, to the arm rather than the axilla. As a rule, the outer end of the incision made for removing the breast, pectoral muscles, and axillary vessels falls short of these brachial glands, so that, unless the incision be especially carried down the arm for a little way, they will not be brought into view. Nor can we reckon upon the presence of a con- tinuous chain of enlarged glands along the axillary vessels to point the way to them. Deceptive inter- vals may intervene between groups of cancerous glands. There is a danger, too, that enlargement of the glands might not have been suspected in a place so remote from the breast tumour. Besides, the casual discovery of cancerous glands by the falla- cious sense of touch, is not to be implicitly relied upon. Thus, more than once, towards the end of a long operation, when, as a last precaution, the incision has been prolonged down the arm, and the enlarged brachial glands have come into view, I have felt a qualm at the thought lest they might have been overlooked. That would, in all proba- bility, have rendered the whole proceeding futile. Such an incident has occurred but recently. The case was one of Paget's disease. The lymphatic glands were extensively involved, some being adhe- rent to the axillary vein close to the subclavms tendon. The lowest lay over the brachial artery, and these were the ones which were almost over- looked. In another instance it is noted that the

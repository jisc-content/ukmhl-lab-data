There are right and proper ways to feel for fluctuation the kidney, the spleen, the edge of liver, enlarged lymphatic glands, and many things besides. The art is learnt by watching the methods of experienced surgeons and by constant practice. A cultivated sense of touch is a valuable possession ; what Luther Holden called ' surgical fingers' is a rare gift. Hence Sir George Humphry's rules, ' Eyes first and much, hands next and little.' The eyes may tell everything, the hands may hurt very much and tell nothing. A little rough hand- ling at the beginning of an abdominal examination throws the muscles into spasm sufficient to mask a tumour of large size ; and the terrified patient usually declines to be hurt again. What is meant by feeling with intent ? Beginners feel without any clear idea of that which they intend to do; perhaps they do not know what they ought to do. An inflamed knee, for example, is handled anyhow on the chance of something being felt. Had the feeling been done thoughtfully and in proper order, the hand would have been gently laid upon the joint to feel for heat, the tip of the finger would have touched the patella to learn whether it had been hidden by the swelling; the patella would have been gently pressed to see whether it lay in contact with the femur, and the swelling would be tested for fluctuation ; finally, each constituent of the joint would be felt in turn to try and learn the condition

252 F/ECAT. LEAKS AND FTSTUT.^: 1 havo known surgeons operate on inflammation of tlie riglit iliac fossa, and afterwards, when the inflammation has proceeded and when faical leaks have formed, it has dawned on them that they have had to deal with actinomycosis, and that diagnosis has been confirmed by the microscopical discovery of the mycelium or clubs of actinomy- cosis in those small yellow bodies. The case of bilharzia which was in our hospital, and which was diagnosed afterwards microscopically, came from South Africa. His faecal leak was not seen at the time of the operation, but afterwards he had for a time, and perhaps has now, a leakage of ftecal contents from the end of the ileum. Thus, when you operate upon a patient who has a chronic disease of the intestinal wall, such as tubercle, actinomy- cosis, or bilharzia, you are likely afterwards to have to deal with a fsecal leak. And remember you may be blamed, unless you are wary, for the occurrence of that leak. There is a last kind of faecal leak which, I think, you will allow me to say a word about, and that is those which are associated with carcinoma. For these, too, in the beginning may be very decep- tive. Four or five years ago a patient in Paget Ward had a small abscess of the abdominal wall. It had no very marked characteristics, and was merely a localized abscess pointing through the abdominal wall. It had one curious featureâ€”it was resonant, it contained gases. It did not follow

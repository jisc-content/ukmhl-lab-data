VARICOSE VEINS 1G6 included, though it is perhaps of less importance in this connexion. Therefore before you proceed see that the patient has good lungs, that the heart and circulation are good, and that he has not any form of nephritis. Provided that is so, you can proceed with your operation. I do not proj)Ose, in a clinical lecture such as this, to go into all the minute details of the operation. I will simply say this : that at this hospital the operation which has been found to be the best is that by small multiple incisions one or one and a half inch long. The vein may be exposed and pulled out, clamped, excised, and tied with fine silk, or whatever you find suitable, it having, of course, been rendered sterile, and then the vein should be allowed to spring back underneath the tissues.

But assuming it is running from below, if

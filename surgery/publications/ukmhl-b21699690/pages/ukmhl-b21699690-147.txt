CARCINOMA OF THE BREAST 129 up by a similar investigation of the neighbouring lymphatics. I am now aware that in no other way can the earliest stages of cancer of the breast be detected. The ordinary attempts at guessing usually succeed in advanced cases, but in the early ones lead to error, delay, and incomplete operations. An instance, which I have mentioned elsewhere, made a profound impression upon my mind.^ A young woman, aged twenty-nine, was assumed to have a small chronic mammary tumour. This was removed and the microscope revealed that it was a cancer. Then a fresh operation had to be undertaken and, as had been suspected, cancer was found in the breast near the scar tissue of the original operation. The axillary lymphatics were also enlarged, but contained no visible carcinoma. Such instances cannot be very uncommon. I am ac- quainted with two exactly similar ones, and in which an immediate microscopical examination would have saved the anxiety and distress of a second operation. The method is so easy and accurate that I wonder it is not more frequently practised. An anaesthetic, an incision, removal of the small tumour, a frozen section stained with an aniline dye, and within from five to ten minutes a scientific—that is to say, a certain—diagnosis. Should the small tumour happily prove to be innocuous, the end is a limited incision, a small scar ; but should it prove malignant, then a thorough operation can be done forthwith. ^ Loc. cit. p. 27.

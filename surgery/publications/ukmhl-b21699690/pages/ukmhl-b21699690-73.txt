INTRA-ABDOMINAL INFLAMMATION 61 of colonies growing in the intestines, and feeding upon the intestinal contents, such as pieces of vegetable which the patient has been allowed to eat before the illness or during it, you can imagine what a quantity of gas they will produce. But I have often doubted whether that was the whole truth, because I have seen a patient one hour comfortable, and without any trace of intestinal distension, and an hour afterwards with the abdomen tightly distended. Where did all that gas come from in such a short time ? There must be other factors besides bacteria in producing flatulent distension, but I think you may safely say that the distension itself is the most important point as far as you are concerned. And you guard against this danger in the preliminary treatment of all abdominal operations by clearing the intestines of the food which the patient has taken, and not allowing any other food shortly before the operation, and in addition by taking care after the operation to see that an accumulation of intestinal gas does not take place. Now I shall refer to another symptom of intra-abdominal inflammation which is a source of fallacy. It is the muscular rigidity which accompanies any inflammation of the peritoneum, whether visceral or parietal. That muscular rigidity, doubtless, is a protective rigidity. Everyone here has seen, during an inflammation of the hip or knee or any other joint, how firmly the joint becomes

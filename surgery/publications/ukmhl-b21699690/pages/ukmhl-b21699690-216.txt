198 SCROTAL SWELLINGS a proper light, though that is only a surmise of mine. He should have taken the patient into a darkened room, lifted up the scrotum, nipped the skin so as to make the hydrocele tight, and get every opaque structure out of the way—for instance the penis and the thigh—and then examined it properly with his electric light. Had he done that, he would have found out something else, because he tapped it with what I call a cow-doctor's trocar—that is, one of those horrid mediaeval things which used to be put into all the instrument- cases. He might have used a trocar of one milli- metre, or one and a half milHmetre, which is quite big enough to let the water out. The patient would not have felt any more than a mere prick, the fluid would have run out, and he would have felt so little inconvenience from the operation that he might have gone and bought a trocar and tapped himself in future, which is what I have known patients do. This doctor had used a cow-doctor's trocar, and out came blood. He had omitted, when he examined it with the light, to examine it with another definite intent in his mind, and that was to see where the testicle was. This patient had the testicle in front instead of behind. The rule is for the cord to be behind the hernial sac and the testicle to be behind the hydrocele, but you must not trust to such rules as that, because some people have got an inversion of the testicle : it is rotated upon its axis, the tunica vaginalis being at the back instead of in front.

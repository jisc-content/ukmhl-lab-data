But the wound got well quickly when he had had what he should have had before, namely, full doses of mercury and iodide of potassium. Tumours of the testicle are very difficult to recognize and full of pitfalls, and therefore you should always be on the look-out for syphilis of the testicle, of the early or late kind, and if there is any possibility of it being syphilitic, you should give a strenuous course of treatment by iodide of potassium and mercury be- fore you proceed to perform an operation. And under those circumstances these tumours not in- frequently disappear in the most extraordinary manner. But a greater pitfall than any is one which I now have to draw your attention to, and that is malig- nant disease of the testicle.

CARCINOMA OF THE BREAST 141 found, but not constantly (fourteen per cent, of cases according to Grossmann). It is rather difficult to guess how any of these become involved in cancer of the breast. Perhaps regurgitation takes place, or, what is much more likely, there are loops of communication between these delto-pectoral lym- phatics and those of the axilla. It is hardly necessary to dwell upon the bearing which the above has upon clinical diagnosis" and surgical treatment. Obviously, when the mammary gland contains a carcinoma—a fact which can easily be learnt by an immediate microscopical examina- tion of the tumour—it is quite unsafe to infer that, because the lowest axillary glands are not enlarged, therefore the uppermost are not. In the beginning the enlargement of the uppermost axillary glands cannot be detected except by taking away the pectorals. In the later stages it usually causes a slight fullness of the infraclavicular fossa, but this can only be seen in those who are thin. It is not a sign to be waited for. Fortunately the removal of the pectorals is borne exceedingly well, and is followed by slight impairment of the usefulness of the arm. Returning again to the axillary lymphatic glands, I propose now to speak of an almost outlying group which on more than one occasion has nearly been overlooked, although enlarged by cancerous growth. This small group is situated about the end of the axillary and beginning of the brachial vessels, and

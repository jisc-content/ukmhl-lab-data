122 INFECTION OF LYMPHATIC GLANDS glands when it gets there ? The first thing that the bacillus does is what it does in any part of the ^odyâ€”at first infiames it ; the gland is palpable and slightly tender. After a while this inflammatory tissue grows and undergoes degeneration, and becomes converted into a substance which is com- pared to cheese, and called caseous material. The caseous material may remain quiescent for some time, or may calcify. But more commonly it softens and becomes converted into tuberculous pus. I will cease now, but remember, please, that epithelioma is an inevitably fatal disease unless dealt with early ; it is certain to pass along the lymphatics; it will in all probabihty infect the nearest lymphatic gland first, but you cannot reckon on its doing so. You do not, as a matter of fact, know which the nearest lymphatics are, and therefore you must make up your mind that it will be erratic in its progress. And remember that in epithelioma you have to pay attention to the little gland on the hyoglossus, the sub-mental gland, the sub-maxillary gland, the cricoid gland, down near the cricoid cartilage; to pay great attention to the gland on the opposite side of the neck, and to the retro-pharyngeal glands.

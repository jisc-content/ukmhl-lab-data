234 EXPLORATORY LAPAROTOMY such as brandy or strychnine, should not be officiously administered. I cannot tell you exactly how to proceed should bleeding occur. I prefer to look my enemy in the face, and therefore in such a case I give an anaesthetic and stop the bleeding with additional ligatures or sutures. The greatest care should be taken to avoid sepsis. A case which bled in the hospital became septic and died. I have purposely laid stress upon these pitfalls so that you may learn how to avoid them. As a matter of fact, cases of exploratory laparotomy do exceedingly well. The tendency is to do good rather than harm, even when much malignant disease is met with.

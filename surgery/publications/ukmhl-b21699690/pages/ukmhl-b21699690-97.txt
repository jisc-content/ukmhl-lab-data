INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION 85 seems as though it cannot be relied upon to propel its contents through the part of it which has been occluded. I remember a desperate case which was under the care of Dr. Wunderlich and Dr. Hutt, and in which acute intestinal obstruction was caused by injury to some coils of small intestine matted together by a long past attack of appen- dicitis. In this case median laparotomy was per- formed, and the distended intestines extruded and emptied, and afterwards the matted intestines separated until they became filled with gas. I assumed wrongly that the passage of gas would continue and give relief. Thinking the matter over, three other courses were open : first, a tem- porary opening might have been made above the entangled mass ; second, the intestine above might have been anastomosed with the colon ; and third, the matted intestine might have been excised. On the whole, the second of these alternatives seems to offer the best chances of success, and I regret that I did not adopt it. The question, too, of the excision of carcinomatous strictures has to be decided. As a rule, owing to distensions and paraly- sis, it is advisable to give relief by opening the bowel, and then seize a favourable opportunity for excision. Other problems arise when intestinal obstruction is caused by tumours such as those of the uterus. I remember assisting my colleague, Mr. Harrison Cripps, to remove a fibroid tumour of the uterus under these circumstances. Here, again, the intes-

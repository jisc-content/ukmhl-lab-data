But nevertheless, when I look back upon my own fatalities, I cannot but think that a proportion of them ought never to have occurred. Patients have been seen and operated upon after they had reached a desperate state. The delay seems mainly to have been due to uncertainty as to what' intestinal obstruction' is, hope that remedies might ultimately prevail, and doubt whether surgery could succeed. A certain sympathy must be felt for this frame of mind. The Hterature on intestinal obstruction is, for ordinary purposes, too full of the morbid anatomy of cases elucidated in the deadhouse. Such details ought to be famihar to the operating surgeon, but they are apt to overwhelm the practitioner ; and, after all, it is he who is first called in to say whether the patient has or has not got intestinal obstruction. Then as regards the surgical treatment. It must be confessed that hitherto the results have not been encouraging ; but the fatalities after opera- tions cannot be attributed to a single cause, such as the operation itself, but to a combination of circumstances. To mention one circumstance, I would instance the want of clear plans for the management of the case from its beginning. From the clinical standpoint most cases of intes- tinal obstruction pass through three phases. In the first the question is whether the patient has or has not got obstruction ; in the second whether

242 FiECAL LEAKS AND FISTULA easy to separate the cfficum from its slight attach- ments to the abdominal wall round the artificial opening, and close it in the usual manner with sutures, and not only to close it in the usual manner but finally. Perhaps you may have seen another faecal leak, which was traumatic, and which occurred in my Avards. A girl was placed under my care who was supposed to have had a tuberculous kidney. In the region of the right kidney there was a mass which felt exactly like an inflamed and probably tuber- culous kidney. Perhaps the kidney was tuberculous ; at any rate, the urine contained pus, and it con- tained bacilli which were identified by the Patho- logical Department as tubercle bacilli. It was clearly necessary to proceed to the removal of the kidney, so I operated through the anterior incision, turned the right colon inwards, and after con- siderable labour extricated what I believed to be a pyonephrosis. There was a sac full of stinking pus, and surrounded by a mass of inflammatory material. The sac was united with a duct which I thought was the ureter, running down close to the course of the ureter and towards the pelvis. This was supposed to be a tuberculous ureter, and so it was traced down as far as possible and then divided in the usual way. The patient recovered from this operation, and I well remember the dresser coming to me a few days afterwards and asking me if I was aware that I had removed a loop of intestine.

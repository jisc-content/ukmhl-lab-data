SCROTAL SWELLINGS 206 and ulceration. So that, contrary to the practice of some, I feel a tendency to get rid of such an encumbrance, although the operation may not in the slightest degree prolong the patient's life, as he is dying of tubercle in various tissues or organs. The chronic tuberculous testis is a different mat- ter. Think much about the nodule of chronic tubercle which the patient has got in the head or in the tail of the epididymis—because that is where it usually first appears—that nodule should excite in your minds a very strong suspicion. At that period it may have gone through the various changes which tubercle undergoes. The tubercle bacillus gets into the human body in some manner, through the tonsil, or some wound, or is inspired ; it then passes along the lymphatics and vessels, say into a gland near the tonsil where it perhaps began. The in- flammatory products then undergo a curious change ; they become converted into what is usually called caseous material, because, I suppose, it resembles cheese, and perhaps it does a little. It may remain quiet for a long time, or it may even calcify, but the common course for that caseous material to pursue is for it to soften, and the result is a tubercu- lous abscess. Place this condition of things in the epididymis or in the testicle, and it wiU go through exactly the same course of events. It will inflame, and at that stage the epididymis is tender. You may say there is a slight attack of epididymitis. If you are a credulous individual, you might credit

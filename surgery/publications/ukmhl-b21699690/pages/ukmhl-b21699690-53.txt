CLINICAL REASONING 41 have seen patients with minute ulcers on the tongue but masses of cancerous glands underneath the jaw. There were curious things in this appendix. Of course, when I speak of cancer I am talking about an unknown disease. Nothing is known about the origin of cancer, and it will not be known until people recognize the fact. The appendix was distended with material which may be mucus or it may be colloid material. It had no tubular glands. Next, the epithehal lining of the lumen was pro- liferating, and it had become converted into mucus or colloid material. At the gap in the appendix through which the Httle arteries and nerves pass into the meso-appendix you can see this material passing through the muscular wall, and filling up the spaces in the meso-appendix. I cannot see any epithelium in the fluid or in any of the stuff in the meso-appendix. If you saw epithelium there it would be evidence in favour of cancer, but alto- gether to my mind it is a curious state of things and suspicious. Of course, if a post mortem had been made we might have found a carcinoma in some part of the alimentary tract. I would now draw your attention to the great danger we are always in of drawing wrong inferences. You may have seen a patient yesterday in the theatre ; if not, go to Lucas Ward and you will see a woman seventy-three years of age, who yester- day had laparotomy performed. She was seen by Dr. Champneys, and had in her pelvis a tumour

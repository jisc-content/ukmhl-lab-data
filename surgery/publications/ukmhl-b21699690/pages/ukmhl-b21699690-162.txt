144 CARCINOMA OF THE BREAST carcinoma from the right breast and axilla (p. 136). A futile attempt had been made to take away the carcinoma. In the axilla the disease was far spread, and the axillary vein had to be taken away with the adherent glands. But the most difficult and embarrassing step in the operation, and attended with much serious haemorrhage, was the removal of the adherent subscapular glands, and of cancer which had grown far backwards in the spaces above and below the triceps tendon. Through the upper quadrilateral space lymphatics from the deltoid and dorsal scapular muscles accompany the posterior circumflex vessels. Here again is an instance of carcinoma spreading against the lymph stream. After the lapse of a year this operation seemed to have been successful ; but, should the growth reappear near the neck of the'scapula, nothing short of Berger's interscapulo- thoracic amputation would suffice. Truly that would be a heavy penalty to pay for a thoroughly inefficient operation, which the first one was.^ After a time cancer of the breast spreads into the glands of the neckâ€”usually a late step in the disease. Doubtless the growth nearly always spreads beneath the clavicle, from the uppermost axillary glands and lymphatics into those in the subclavian triangle. But there is a possibility that it may find a shorter way through lymphatics which cross in front of 1 This has since been carried out, and was followed by a rapid recovery.

200 T)TAON08T8 OF TUMOUR.S or an inflammatory swelling. On the whole, it was most like a sarcoma. Excision of the tumour and. even amputation of the arm were talked about, but the wound was closed pending a microscopical examination. Ultimately the tumour sloughed, and the slough was exactly like a piece of wet washleather. Obviously it, too, was a gumma. Many intra-abdominal tumours cannot be diag- nosed with the naked eye. I have mentioned else- where a growth which implicated the intestine, and was thought to be malignant in spite of a micro- scopical section which had shown that it was inflam- matory. Then I had a lingering confidence in my powers of making a naked-eye diagnosis of tumours. But the microscope was vindicated when the tumour departed and left no trace of its presence, for the patient ultimately died of septicaemia derived from a small abscess along the right ureter. On another occasion a large tumour of the great omentum had the naked-eye appearances of malignant growth, but the microscope revealed nothing but inflamma- tory deposit. The omentum was removed, other- wise the case might have got included amongst abdominal tumours, supposed to be malignant, but which disappear after laparotomy. The naked- eye diagnosis of such abdominal tumours unsup- ported by microscopical evidence is mere food for the credulous. Again, tumours which to the naked eye seem to be inflammatory are oftentimes malig- nant. Gall-stones were removed from a very thick

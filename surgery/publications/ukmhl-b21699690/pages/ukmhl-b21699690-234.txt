SCROTAL SWELLINGS 216 quently come across rather startling histories of malignant disease such as that. I am quite aware that in my brief remarks upon the tumours of the scrotum, the neck of the scrotum, and the inguinal canal, I have omitted a great deal, especially haematocele, and you may observe that I have omitted to deal with, or have only half dealt with, tumours of the neck of the scrotum itself, but that is because I have not had time to go into them. But you have not missed much after all, because these tumours nearly always ascend or descend, and those which originate in the neck of the scrotum are quite rare. My memory tells me of a few cysts or fatty tumours or varicoceles which did not go far down or far up, and a few tuberculous lumps, but tumours which originate in the neck of the scrotum are relatively unusual. If any one does me the compHment of thinking over what I have said, they will come to the conclusion that I have been telling them to pursue methods of diagnosis, and not to try to remember cases. I have told you about a few cases, but they were to exemplify my own errors. And, after all, you cannot remember ordinary cases ; you can only remember startling cases, such as those I have related.

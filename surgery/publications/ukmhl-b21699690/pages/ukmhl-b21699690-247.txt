It would be very sad to allow any one to die of jaundice, caused by an impacted gall-stone. That can be extracted, and the cases, in spite of the jaundice, do exceedingly well. But when the jaundice is caused by malignant growth in the liver itself, or in the head of the pancreas, the outlook is forbidding in the extreme. But even here some reHef can be afforded by estabhshing a biliary fistula between the gall-bladder and the exterior of the body, or by making a communication between the lumen of the gall-bladder and that of the intestine. I have tried both of these plans and am at present in favour of the formation of a fistula between the gall-bladder and the surface of the body. But, in spite of statistics served up for the credulous, I advise you to approach exploratory operations upon the deeply jaundiced with extreme circumspection, and after every other means of diagnosis has been exhausted. What would you think if one were to try and explain fatalities by such sillinesses as ' failure of the heart', ' delayed shock ', and so forth ? The children's phrase, ' died from want of breath,' would be quite as felicitous. Exploratory laparotomy has oftentimes the effect of assuaging the pain of malignant disease. Pain is a very variable feature. It may be wanting or it may be excruciating. It is difficult to account for

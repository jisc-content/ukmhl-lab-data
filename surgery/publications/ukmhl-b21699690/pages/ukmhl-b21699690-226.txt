208 SCROTAL SWELLINGS have gone through exactly the same stages. They may be inflamed, and in that case you feel them thickened, tender, and hard. If it has gone on to caseation, you will feel a hard lump, with very Httle sensation of pain in it at all. Next you proceed one step further, and I have been rather astonished at the result of this manoeuvre. The patient is supposed to have tubercle, and you have very strong reasons for thinking that he has tubercle of his genito- urinary tract. He is asked to pass his water into a glass, and that is held up to the light, and very likely it will contain blood, and I have seen it con- tain pus and muco-pus, and all sorts of shreds. In other words, the tuberculous disease may have begun close to the epididymis, passed along the vas deferens to the prostate and the vesiculse semi- nales, and out of the ejaculatory ducts and in- fected the neck of the bladder, where there is tuberculous ulceration, because as the tuberculous material softens it discharges into the bladder. When you look into the bladder with the endoscope you see it is tuberculous. How do you know ? You see the caseous material in the base of the ulcer. But you have not finished with your case yet; your mind will still be prompting you to follow up the ureters. Tubercle may spread up the ureters, jiist as the septis does in the case of ascendmg pyelo- nephritis, and you should therefore examme the kidneys, to see if there is any suspicion of tubercle there, because it would be a great disaster to remove

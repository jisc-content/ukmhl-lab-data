If this result be obviated by gastro-enterostomy, or by intestinal anastomosis, life may be prolonged for a space of time to be measured by years rather than by months. Even when the exploratory laparotomy has revealed an obvious tumour of the pylorus the palliative gastro- enterostomy affords great relief, and not infre- quently leads the patient to suppose that he is quite well. Further, as you are aware, the presence of a tumour which can be seen and felt is not proof positive of the presence of a tumour with malignant attributes. When I lectured to you upon the early microscopical diagnosis of tumours,^ an instance was given in which I had mistaken an inflammatory growth and thought that it was malignant. Pro- vided a piece of the tumour can be excised, an immediate microscopical examination is the safe- guard against such an error, and a freezing micro- tome and a microscope should form a part of the organization of nearly all exploratory operations.

IN DISEASE OF THE TONGUE 119 the gland in its substance is enlarged unless you remove it. Then you have to go down the neck to the level of the cricoid cartilage to see if there are glands in the carotid sheath. Kemember, we are planning out our incision for removing the glands in the neck on definite scientific lines. The incision must go forward to the mental process, otherwise you will overlook the mental gland ; it must go down to the level of the cricoid cartilage, otherwise you will overlook the gland at the level of the cricoid cartilage ; it must go back as far as the sterno-mastoid, otherwise you cannot remove the next glands which we come to, the glandulae con- catenatÂ£e (vide Figs. 2 and 3). Concatenated means chained. And there is a chain of glands which extends from the base of the skull towards the root of the neck, along the carotid sheath ; they are all round the internal jugular vein and the common and internal carotid arteries. When the glands are enlarged at the base of the skull it is a desperate business, and it is practically useless to endeavour to remove them, in my experience. It may be right to try, but I think whoever tries wiU be foiled in his endeavours. Do you remember I said that the old lady who had an epithelioma rather far back on her tongue, close to the pillar of the fauces, had the recurrence situated on the opposite side of the neck ? Clinically no return could be discovered on the side on which the original epithelioma had been, but when she

But I will assume that the cases have been operated upon within a reasonable time. Now let us consider some other causes of hydro- cele. We will take tubercle next. In some cases of hydrocele the collection of fluid in the tunica vaginalis conceals the fact that the patient has behind it a tuberculous testis.

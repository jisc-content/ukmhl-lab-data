132 CARCINOMA OF THE BREAST one which is particularly prone to early ulceration, and was situated in the midst of sepsis, which may or may not have caused the enlargement of those lymphatic glands in which no cancerous growth could be seen. But it is obvious that a living organism, such as a cancer is, must conform to physiological rules, and that its products must escape by its veins or by its lymphatics. Taking into consideration the fact that a cancer is a sort of ductless gland opening freely into the lymphatic system, it is reasonable to fix upon the latter as the outlet. That that which enters the circulation through the lymphatic is very harmful is suggested by the marked accession of health and vigour which often follows the removal of the tumour and of the cancerous glands. To me this cannot be altogether accounted for by the relief of the mental anxiety and foreboding. The naked eye is an untrustworthy guide, both to the nature of most tumours and to the growth in lymphatic glands. Whilst removing a carcinoma of the breast the lymphatic glands were found enlarged and hard as high as the subclavius tendon, and in the subclavian triangle. From these naked eye appearances it was assumed that they were fiUed with cancer undergoing degeneration. How- ever the subsequent microscopical exammation showed that they were full of tubercle. This com- bination of tubercle and cancer has been occasionally met with. What is the meaning of it ?

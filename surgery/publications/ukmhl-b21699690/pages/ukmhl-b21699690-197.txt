INGUINAL SWELLINGS 179 the inguinal canal. There is a swelling in the neighbourhood of the inguinal canal which has a sharp impulse when the patient coughs. The finger passed up the scrotum passes into the external abdominal ring, which is loose, and when a cough is given something is felt to be striking against the finger. This something goes back when the patient lies down. That, I suppose, would be the simplest possible case of an ordinary inguinal hernia. If, in addition, you felt it gurgle as it went back, you would think it was probably intestine containing air. With the exception of the case in which it gurgles, I have seen those signs over and over again simulated by a condition which is com- mon, but I think seldom talked about or recognized. The condition I refer to is that which I have called an inguinal varicocele. In future do not speak of varicocele as I did at the beginning of this lecture, but speak of two kinds, scrotal varicocele and inguinal varicocele. When once you have realized that the] veins in the inguinal canal may be greatly enlarged and varicose, and bulge out the canal, there is no difficulty in understanding that that is very frequently indeed associated with ordinary scrotal varicocele. I do not think a case of varicocele in which you could feel the enlarged veins passing up into the neck of the scrotum, in which you could feel them passing through an enlarged inguinal canal, and in which you saw a large swelling in the inguinal canal corresponding 1^2

134 CARCINOMA OF THE BREAST lymphatics. When this was done I could discover nothing wrong with the right mammary gland, but nine months afterwards a minute nodule was felt near its sternal edge, exactly opposite the tumour which had been removed. This minute growth was examined microscopically by the imme- diate method, and was a carcinoma of the same type as that which had been removed from the other breast. Is it right to think that that cancer had crossed over the sternum along the lymphatics from one mammary gland to the other ? In this particular instance this, to me, seems the likeliest explanation; but soon another case of bilateral cancer will be described in which this explanation seems less likely, because the bilateral tumours were not of the same histological type. I suppose that in the above instance the carci- noma may have grown from one breast to the other in the lymphatics which cross the sternum, or have been forced along them by the cutting and handling during the operation, or carried over before the operation was done in some regurgitant stream set up by the obstruction of the opposite axillary lymphatics. But this mysterious disease is full of puzzles, and will be until its etiology is known. It would not be easy to explain the following instance of bilateral cancer by supposmg that it had grown along the lymphatics or been earned as an embolus. I removed the left breast and pectorals and all the axillary lymphatics, together

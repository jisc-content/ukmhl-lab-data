INTRA-ABDOMINAL INFLAMMATION G5 My time has come to an end. This is a very- great topic. Supposing you are brought into contact with a very chronic and mild case of intra-abdominal inflammation, I think the issue is easy. You put the case to bed and give it a period of probation. But the more fulminating cases are more difficult to manage. You will have to decide quickly whether the inflammation is increasing or diminishing. If it is diminishing, the pulse and temperature and leucocytosis will fall and the local symptoms also will diminish. I so often observe that gentlemen do not know how to tell whether the local area of rigidity and tenderness is diminishing or not. If there is any question about it, place the tip of your finger on the abdominal wall where the local ten- derness is and give a sharp prod with the tip of your finger at one place. The patient will perhaps say that does not hurt him. Move it about an inch away and do the same, and he will perhaps say it does hurt. Then draw your line round the area of tenderness as ascertained in that way. Next day you will be able to judge accurately whether the tenderness is an inch or two less, or whether it has spread beyond the line. There you have a determinant symptom. Simultaneously the pulse- rate and the temperature will rise. Supposing the patient vomits continuously, you have a determinant symptom. Or if no passage of wind has taken place, you have a determinant symptom ; and I think, instead of taking days as your period of probation LOOKWOOD !F

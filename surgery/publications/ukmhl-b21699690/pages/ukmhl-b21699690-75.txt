INTRA-ABDOMINAL INFLAMMATION 63 tion. And then when the patient was placed upon his back and his abdomen was felt, we at once came upon a huge hard mass, which I think I am correct in saying none of us had felt before. So the rigidity had protected the inflamed septic kidney from pressure. And the rigidity in this case was very great because the peritoneum over the kidney was inflamed too. I know that because I have seen it. Curious instances of mistakes due to this form of protective rigidity occur. I saw a very stout woman in the country, who had been seen by a friend of mine, and he concluded that, as she was rigid in the abdominal wall on the right side and it was very tender, she must have acute appen- dicitis. It was a fair assumption to make as the pain was in the right side. It was clear she had intra-abdominal inflammation, and the pain and tenderness and rigidity were all in the right place for that condition. I was a little more cautious, because I had not seen that inflamed appendix. All I said was that she had some inflamed structure on the right brim of the pelvis, and that as her tem- perature was continuously high, and her pulse had become increasingly rapid, and she had had rigors, it was clear that unless she had something done she would probably die. The moment she was placed under an anaesthetic a tumour was felt with a line of resonance between it and the right crural arch. Also we could feel the rounded margin of the tumour. My next question to the medical man was, ' Has

194 SCROTAL SWELLINGS test to it. If that swelUng at the bottom of the scrotum is testicle, you will be able to feel the spermatic cord descending to it. You will recognize the cord because you will be able to feel the vas deferens, and perhaps the spermatic artery and those small cords will slip about in your fingers. Next, the swelling itself will have an epididymis which you can feelâ€”and you ought to make your- selves quite familiar with the exact feel of those structures when they are healthy.

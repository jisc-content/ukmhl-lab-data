193 SCROTAL SWELLINGS kind of swelling which may have descended and also the kind of swelling which may have ascended. Clearly, it is necessary to know both before you can proceed with the swellings in the neck of the scrotum. We will assume that the swelling is in the scrotum itself. You will begin with your eyes, and inspect the skin of the scrotum first. It is red, it is shiny, and from that fact you will infer that there is beneath the skin of the scrotum an inflamed structure of some kind. And that will make you exceedingly cautious ; because the inflamed struc- tures which are met with in the scrotum are often of exquisite sensibility, and if the unwary proceeds to feel incautiously, or squeezes the cord to see whether it ascends into the neck of the scrotum (and perhaps has not observed that there is a urethral discharge at the same time), he will pro- bably make an enemy for the rest of his life. So it is, both to you and to the patient, of the very greatest importance that you should look at the scrotum as a beginning, with the view of seeing what you may venture to do. Let us suppose you have looked at the scrotal swelling, that the neck of the scrotum is the same on that side as on the other ; you will then see what shape or kind of swelling you have to deal with.

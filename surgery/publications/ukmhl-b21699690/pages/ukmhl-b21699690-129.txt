IN DISEASE OF THE TONGUE 115 And this little gland lies close to the edge of the mylohyoid. Over and over again I have seen these glands overlooked in epithehoma of the tongue, they are overlooked because people are not aware of the extreme difficulty of feeling lymphatic glands. As a rule, lymphatic glands, when they are enlarged, are easier to see than they are to feel. A patient was brought to Kenton Ward the other day who had recurrent epithelioma of the floor of the mouth and enlarged lymphatic glands on both sides of the neck. Many could not feel the lymphatic glands which were situated in the left side of the neck, but they could see them when the man was placed in a proper light; they could be seen as little pro- jections beneath the skin of his neck. This little gland on the hyoglossus ought to be felt for as a routine proceeding in the case of an affection of the tongue, and I have often shown you how to feel for it. The patient is sat up on a chair, and one finger is passed inside the mouth, close to the tongue, and the other is put outside the mouth at the sub-maxillary triangle. The fingers are then squeezed together, and then you will probably feel the enlarged gland slip away between the fingers. That manoeuvre ought never to be overlooked in an examination of the glands in connexion with epithelioma of the tongue. If you merely put your finger outside you will never feel anything, because you push any enlarged gland which there may be up into the mouth ; you will not feel it

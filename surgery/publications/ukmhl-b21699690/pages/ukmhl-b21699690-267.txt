The reason was that m spite of the most careful search and care, we dia not know of any local condition, such as tubercle or actinomycosis or cancer, which would prevent that fistula healing. As regards the chronic infective diseases, tubercle in particular, they are a dangerous and serious class of intestinal leaks. I can remember the first that I was associated with.

I opened the abdomen and found the intestines and omentum densely matted together by tuberculous inflamma- tion. Caseous material was seen, so the diagnosis was not in any doubt. I exercised the greatest caution in searching amidst these adhesions, but the wound afterwards suppurated.

You might now say, ' What a dangerous thing laparo- tomy must be in cases with tuberculous peritonitis ! ' I think you would be right if you qualified your statement by saying, ' in cases of tuberculous peri- tonitis in which there is no fluid.'

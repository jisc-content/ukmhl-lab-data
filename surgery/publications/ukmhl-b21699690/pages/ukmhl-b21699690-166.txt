148 CARCINOMA OF THE BREAST carcinoma. Being so far from the breast, we thought it might have been tuberculous. The patient was young and vigorous, and anxious that an attempt should be made to relieve her from the pain and misery of an ulcerating carcinoma, and, one might add, from the imminent risk of dying of sepsis. During the dissection of the neck but few glands were met with along the internal jugular vein, nor about its junction with the subclavian. In other words, the state of affairs was not so bad as might have been expected. Eight months afterwards this unfortunate woman came with a small, movable nodule in the right mammary gland. This I have already mentioned, for it consisted of chronic mastitis and of carcinoma (p. 135). The woman's health being good, and all the left axilla and neck free from any trace of disease, an amputa- tion of the right breast was done. Six months afterwards her condition was quite satisfactory.^ But in yet another case the result was less propitious. At the age of thirty-four the right breast had been amputated for carcinoma. Then the disease grew in the lymphatic glands of the axilla and posterior triangle In the infraclavicular fossa the mass of glands was immovably fixed. I might have been deterred by this had I not succeeded in removing a similar growth, and which had not returned after the lapse of three years.

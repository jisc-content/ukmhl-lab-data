VARICOSE VEINS 155 ago ; but if I remember rightly, it was thought to be probably an irreducible and inflamed femoral epiplocele. When exposed it was of a deep purple colour and very hard, and when it was dissected out it was found to be attached to a common femoral vein by a narrow neck. It was the ampulla of the saphenous vein, dilated and full of hard, old clot. I had never seen anything like it before. But that dilated ampulla of the saphenous vein is obviously a thing to which you ought to turn your attention, and be careful you do not mistake if for a femoral rupture. Leaving now these cases of difficulty of diagnosis I will now come to another matter, namely, the effects which these veins produce upon the patients. First of all, as regards the mental position of the patients who have varicose veins. I have always observed that the patients are very anxious about the veins ; they think that their dilated and enlarged veins may burst and that they may in consequence bleed to death. Of course such veins very rarely do burst, and I think the patients would never, nowadays, bleed to death. But what has that to do with us medical men ? That is what the patient thinks. So let us drop our egotism and try to put ourselves in the patient's place and take his feelings into consideration. And it will be a great comfort to the people with varicose veins who come to consult you if you are able to assure them that they have varicose veins with very thick walls.

DURING COURSE OF OPERATION 271 use It has fallen to my lot to operate for the removal of some very large com.ect.ve-t.ssue tumom-s. A cartilaginous tumour of the scapuh. weighed more than twelve pounds aftei about a pint of fluid had run out of a cavity in its interior but within nine months a second operation had to be done for growths in the remains of the scapular muscles and in the axillary glands. Now, these large chondi-omata of the scapula and pelvis usually contain sarcomatous elements, and we may surmise that these latter had grown along the muscles and fascial planes. Now, the extent of these prolonga- tions cannot be seen with the naked eye. bo, in another similar case, besides removing the suspected muscles very widely as I went along, I gave a scrap of every doubtful tissue to Mr. Shaw, who at once reported upon it. Thus one had reasonable cer- tainty at each step of this very extensive operation. In removing numerous and extensive epithelioma- tous glands from the neck, too, it was of essential service to know what was being removed, because in addition to the growth there was much inflam- matory thickening. What is the meaning of this association of inflammation with carcinoma ? Or, again, the front half of both upper jaws had to be removed for epithelioma. This had grown for an indefinite distance into the upper lip. After the lip had been separated from the tumour, a piece of its deeper part was examined microscopically. It had some carcinoma in it, so a larger piece of lip was cut

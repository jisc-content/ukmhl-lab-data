VII CARCINOMA OF THE BREAST, AND ITS SPREAD INTO THE LYMPHATICS' In spite of all the good work that has been done by anatomists, pathologists, and surgeons, I have, during the course of many operations for cancer of the breast, met with much that has not been explained. It is to be feared that we may not hope for clear light until the etiology of cancer is known. But, in the meantime,each addition to our knowledge of the manner in which cancer of the breast spreads adds to the efficiency of operations done for its extirpation. Without this knowledge it is difficult to see how a complete removal can be accomplished. The spread of cancer along the lymphatics is, however, an erratic and complicated process, and I propose to tell you of the things which I have noticed.

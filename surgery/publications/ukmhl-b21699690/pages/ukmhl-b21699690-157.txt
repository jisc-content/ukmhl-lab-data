CARCINOMA or THE BREAST 139 On many occasions after having taken away the pectoral muscles, I have found considerable enlargement of the uppermost axillary glands, although the lowest pectoral ones seemed to have escaped. This anomaly can be explained upon anatomical grounds, for although the main bulk of the lymphatics of the breast enter the pectoral group of axillary glands, nevertheless others run upwards through the fibres of the pectoralis major, or between the sternal and clavicular heads, to empty into the uppermost axillary or subclavian glands. This important accessory lymphatic channel is described and depicted in Poirier, Cuneo, and Delamare's standard work on the lymphatics,^ which has been well and clearly translated by Mr. Cecil H. Leaf, who has himself worked at this subject. I have found in Professor Poirier's work many anatomical explanations of the course of cancer along the lymphatics, which before I had only known from clinical observation. I have been especially indebted in the case of the lymphatics of the tongue. ^ Grossmann ^ suc- ceeded in injecting the accessory mammary lym- ^ The Lymphatics, Poirier and Cuneo, translated by Cecil H.

EXPLORATORY LAPAROTOMY 219 but afterwards that ceased to be the wise and courageous course. But so strange is the human mind that there are some who do not wish to know. Not long since an exploratory laparotomy revealed a carcinoma of the great omentum. The patient never asked what had been found, or what had been done, and although some ascitic fluid re-formed, and she became much emaciated, yet I am told that she never again alluded to her complaint. Her friends and relations were duly informed. Sometimes it is imperative to tell the patient what is the matter. Business affairs may have to be settled or property disposed of. But the question I have raised is not in reality a very hard one. Although the task is a very painful one to undertake, I am sure that in by far the greater number of instances the patient has a right to know, and ought to be told. Infinite gentleness and tact are needed. At the moment you understand the meaning of the stereotyped phrase : ' the judge was visibly affected when he put on the black cap.' There is yet another issue to be faced when the exploratory operation has brought to light a malig- nant growth which cannot be taken away. Very likely the growth has begun to lessen the strength and vitality of the patient, who, not unnaturally, blames the operation when the weakness and prostration increase. Indeed, you need not be surprised to hear that you are blamed for having done an unnecessary operation.

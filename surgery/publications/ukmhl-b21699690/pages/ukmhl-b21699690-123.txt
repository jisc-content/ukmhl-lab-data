IN DISEASE OF THE TONGUE 111 tracts of the epithelioma some septic absorption takes place and the glands become septic ; secondly, the usual reason is that they have got cancer grow- ing in them. There are a few troubles in the tongue which you ought not to mistake for epithelioma, but it is often exceedingly difficult not to mistake them. For instance, gumma of the tongue. That ought not as a rule to be mistaken for epithelioma. The gumma is a lump in the substance of the tongue, and at the beginning covered with mucous membrane, and the centre of this gumma is in a condition which indicates degeneration. The gumma spreads to the mucous membrane, and the mucous membrane undergoes degeneration ; then the con- tents run out and leave a sort of crater. Occasionally tubercle of the tongue occurs, but I do not thinlc you often mistake that for epithelioma. It is usually very acute, and it will usually be possible to find the tubercle bacillus. In addition, the people I have seen with tubercle of the tongue have got tubercle elsewhereâ€”in the pharynx, in the larynx, or in the lungs. Still, there are occasions on which this condition may be very hard to diagnose. I will not mention any of the rarer conditions, but I would draw your attention to a source of error which occurs very often, and has occurred only in the last fort- night. If you look at the margins of anybody's tongue you will see the foliate papillae, and you can trace them in front of the anterior pillar of the fauces, and can see there on the edge of the

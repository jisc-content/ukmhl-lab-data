Surely educated medical men ought by this time to have thought the problem out and to have been sure that an essential part of the diagnosis of a fracture is a proper X-ray photograph. I might give many instances of the influence of new inventions upon our ideas of a diagnosis. The bladder endoscope has done a great deal; it has almost revolutionized bladder surgery. The use of the endoscope is a long step towards the diag- nosis of some forms of cystitis. I remember an unfortunate student of this hospital who ultimately succumbed to genito-urinary tuberculosis.

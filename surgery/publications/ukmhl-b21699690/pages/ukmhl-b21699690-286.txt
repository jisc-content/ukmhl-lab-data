208 DIAGNOSIS OF TUMOURS matory when, as a matter of fact, it is not. For instance, a tumour at the inner side of the left nipple was cut into, and some cysts brought into view, and then a little pus. The pathologist, who was in attendance, looking at the cut surface of the tumour, and having also seen the pus, without hesitation said the tumour was inflammatory. It will be agreed that on ordinary clinical grounds he had ample justification. But the immediate micro- scopical examination brought to light a carcinoma â€”a so-called duct carcinoma. Many enlargements of the lymphatic glands cannot be diagnosed by ordinary clinical methods. Fortunately, they are usually situated in accessible places, and can easily be removed for immediate microscopical examination. This method has brought to light things which to me have oftentimes been rather surprising. I know that the philoso- phical historian has said that we wonder because we are ignorant, but I also know that' the recogni- tion of ignorance is the beginning of knowledge. A dustman had enlargement of the cervical glands which was thought to be tuberculous, but was removed and contained squamous-celled car- cinoma. The glands had probably been infected from an ulcer in the pharynx. Another man was supposed to be suffering from lymphoma (I confess that that term conjures up no clear image in my mind), but the microscope showed that the enlarge- ment was myxosarcoma. On the other hand.

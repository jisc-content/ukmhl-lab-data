CLINICAL REASONING 27 a continuously high temperature, and ^^^^ Pulse record was continuously high ; it was usually 108 or 110. Further, assuming that this disease was inflammatory, it was inside the chest, it was not outside. I had been called to open an inflam- matory disease outside the chest, so it was of not inconsiderable importance to get it inside. The next step was to tell whether the inflammatory affection inside the chest was solid or whether it was fluid. If it was fluid and composed of pus, one must have pursued the ordinary surgical methods and let it out. If it was solid, one would wait a little while and see what happened to it. Pus is more likely to increase than it is to depart, but a soHd inflammatory swelling of the pleura or lung will as often as not take its departure. The voice sounds could be heard, and it was clear that the sound was proceeding through something which was solid. A slight fall in the temperature and in the pulse-rate told that this solid inflammatory trouble inside the chest was beginning to get better. There was a small but continuous drop in the tem- perature and in the pulse-rate, and over and over again the preliminary to recovery in an inflammatory affection is a sHght drop, either in the pulse-rate, or in the temperature. The pulse-rate usually falls before the temperature. When the tempera- ture has been high—102° or 103° F., a small drop in the pulse-rate, say from 96 to 90, has told me, and in future will tell you, that the patient was

CARCINOMA OF THE BREAST 145 the clavicle along with that morphologically inter- esting vein, the jugulo-cephalic. According to Poirier, lymphatics have been seen by Grossmann passing over the clavicle from the uppermost axillary glands into the subclavian. Mascagni, too, has seen some of the lymphatics which ascend with the cephalic vein (delto-humeral), cross the clavicle and enter the cervical glands.^ When we consider that some of the mammary lymphatics run straight upwards towards the clavicle ; and, further, when we consider the abundant intercommunications between contiguous lymphatics, it is not difficult to believe that occa- sionally some of the mammary lymphatics may short-circuit themselves into the cervical by crossing over the clavicle. Clearly the subclavian lymphatic glands demand careful attention in every case of mammary carcinoma, whether the axillary are or are not enlarged. Indeed, some surgeons carry their distrust so far as to remove the subclavian glands in every case. I myself have not yet reached this stage. I content myself with a thorough dis- section carried above and below the axillary and subclavian veins as far as can be reached by raising the clavicle upwards. In most cases this dissection brings to light a gland which was hidden from sight underneath the great vein just where the subclavius muscle crosses it. Enlarged glands are occasionally found ' Loc. cit., pp. 240, 245. LOCKWOOD X

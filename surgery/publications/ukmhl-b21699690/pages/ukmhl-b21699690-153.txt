CARCINOMA OF THE BREAST 135 with a great quantity of others from the posterior triangle of the neck, for the ordinary form of scirrhus carcinoma. Eight months afterwards, the patient was much improved in health, and the left side was quite free from disease, but a small movable nodule had appeared in the right breast just beyond the outer edge of the areola. The part of this nodule nearest the nipple was chronic mastitis pure and simple ; that nearest the axilla was cancer. Although none could be felt, the axilla contained numerous cancerous lymphatic glands. Now the mammary lymphatics are so abundant and intercommunicate so freely, that it is possible that the cancer had passed along them over to the side of the breast furthest from the original growth ; but to me it does not seem likely. Then which came first, the carcinoma or the mastitis ? Did the carcinoma cause the mastitis or did it grow in a lobule already inflamed ? An answer to these questions may be found in a similar combination of chronic mastitis and carcinoma which was met with in another case. Several of the breast lobules were enlarged and indurated. A nodule of cancer was found in one only. Obviously a constant cause ought to produce a constant effect, and cancer should have been found in all of the inflamed lobules. Probably the chronic inflammation only prepared the ground for the carcinoma in the breast, as it does sometimes in the tongue and elsewhere. Those who attempted to make a correct clinical diagnosis

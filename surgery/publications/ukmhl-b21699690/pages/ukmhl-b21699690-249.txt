EXPLORATORY LAPAROTOMY 231 is rendered difficult or impossible because the growth itself may become inflamed. I believe, myself, that inflammation caused the growth of the left lobe of the liver, and that of the colon, to adhere to the abdominal walls.

Not infrequently, until the exploratory laparotomy, an inflammatory tumour with or without pus in it is pronounced to be a growth. In the present year a tumour in the right side of the abdomen, and which competent authorities said was a growth, proved to be a collection of pus behind the colon ; though another beneath the right costal arch, and which I felt sure was a tumour of the liver, began to fluctuate and was emptied of pus. Under simflar circumstances hydatids have been met with. Not long ago I found the region of the gall-bladder occupied by a mass which adhered to the liver, stomach, omen- tum, and transverse colon. Its removal was imprac- ticable, but nevertheless the pain and vomiting were entu-ely relieved, and eighteen months after- wards the patient was considered to be very well. Clearly exploratory laparotomy is not to be undertaken with a light heart. But when it has to be done take every possible precaution that forethought can devise.

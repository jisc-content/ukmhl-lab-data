84 RECOGNITION AND MANAGEMENT OF On another occasion it was assumed that the obstruction was in the hepatic flexure of the colon ; the distended ctecum was opened. At a subsequent operation, when the abdomen was no longer dis- tended, the carcinomatous stricture was found high in the rectum. The csecal opening was a source of discomfort, and the large intestine got loaded with faeces, so that sigmoid colotomy had to be performed. Whilst one can look back upon a few cases in which a happy guess has been made as to the seat of obstrucjiion, one has also to confess that there are many others in which the guess has been wrong. In the absence of some guiding sign, it seems hardly safe to infer more than that in chronic intestinal obstruction the cause is in some part of the large intestine, whilst in acute it may be in the small. Hitherto I have purposely avoided the use of the terms acute and chronic. The assumption that a case is chronic oftentimes tends to fatal delay. Chronic cases may at any moment become acute, and even in the chronic irreparable changes are slowly but surely progressing. When the cause of the obstruction has been located it may be easy to decide what to do ; but some of the problems which arise are full of embarrassment. I have already mentioned a case in which, after the removal of the cause of the obstruction, an error of judge- ment was probably committed in not immediately draining the small intestine through a temporary opening. After the intestine has been distended it

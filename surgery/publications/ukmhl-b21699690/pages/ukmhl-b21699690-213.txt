SCROTAL SWELLINGS 195 that a further operation was necessary to put him right. That is a position in which anybody may be placed unless he is an observant person, and unless he proceeds with his diagnosis in a methodical manner. Now let us proceed to consider another swelling in the scrotum, which is almost always quite easy to detect with the naked eye, and that is an oval swelling in the scrotum covered with natural skin, and which in part of its length shows a slight, broad constriction. Notice, I did not say it was a pyri- form swelling, but an oval swelling which in some part is slightly constricted. If I were to compare it to a jargonelle pear you might expect the con- striction to be one third the distance from the thin end, but the constriction is often half-way down. Now, in making generalizations, I would say that collections of fluid in the tunica vaginalis become constricted. If you go to the top gallery of the museum, you will see a specimen of hydrocele which has been dried and blown up, and if you look critically at it you will observe its shape and that there is a slight constriction, and I think you will agree that at the situation of the constriction there are a few transverse fibres in the processus vaginalis. What these fibres are I do not know, but they are always there in some part of the tunica vaginalis, and they are the fibres which produce this constriction. I have further evidence that it is so from my own experience, because over and o 2

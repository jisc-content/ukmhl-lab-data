120 INFECTION OF LYMPHATIC GLANDS returned there was no question about a considerable mass of glands in the opposite triangle, underneath the opposite angle of the jaw, around the internal carotid artery. How do those glands get infected ? These authors to whom I have referred have repro- duced a very excellent picture (vide Fig. 1) from one of the finest works on anatomy ever published, and that is a book which you will find in the library, and which was written by the celebrated Sappey. If you want to become a very original anatomist read Cruveilhier and Sappey, and every one will think you are a most original person. This picture of Sappey's, who injected the lymphatics of the tongue with mercury, throws a great deal of light on the matter. I will make a sketch showing how the lymphatics of the tongue go back. The lymphatics of the side of the tongue, as I have repeatedly said, pass down the side into the sub-mental, sub-maxillary, and the glandulee concatenatse. Here on the dorsum of the tongue are many lymphatics which emerge in front of the epiglottis, and then pass off through the wall of the pharynx in relation with that lymphatic structure, the tonsil. Some are depicted passing across the middle line of the tongue, to reach the opposite side of the pharynx. That is the course which the epitheliomatous infection took in the case of the old lady. Thus you see that the glands on the opposite side of the neck can be infected almost as easily as those on the same side. When once the lymphatics of the

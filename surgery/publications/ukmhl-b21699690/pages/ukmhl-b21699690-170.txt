152 VARICOSE VEINS provided they would carry out the rule in diagnosis which I have always laid down for youâ€”that is, that you should examine the whole of the diseased limb or structure. I suspect what probably happens in these cases is that the patient appears and says he has a rupture. The word ' rupture ' excites the mind of the persons who hear the word, they get a sort of obsession, and cannot get the idea of rupture out of their minds. They look at the swelling, and they see it is in the femoral region. They tell the patient to cough, and they see the impulse. But they have omitted to examine the whole of the limb, and they do not observe that lower down there is a varix of the saphenous vein. An additional source of error, perhaps, is that between the dilatation of the ampulla and the vein below there is a part of the limb in which no varix can be seen to exist, perhaps in the upper third of the thigh. So it is very like a femoral hernia. The other day I saw an exceedingly difficult case. A patient came who was known to have varix, and was wearing an elastic stocking. But it was thought that in addition he had a hernia. In the region of femoral hernia, in Scarpa's tri- angle, he had what I should say was a most close resemblance to femoral hernia. He had a swelling which appeared when he stood and dis- appeared when he was lying down, which had a great impulse in it, and which could be pressed back, and which felt to me very like a hernia.

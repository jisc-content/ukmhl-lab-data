224 EXPLORATORY LAPAROTOMY distasteful expedients if by any possibility they could be avoided. When the abdomen is distended by a solid tumour, and when that solid tumour cannot be removed, a most dangerous condition is brought about. In all probability the heart, lungs, and intestines were much impeded before the operation, and after it is over the cause of their impediment still persists ; and now the shock of the operation, the after-effects of the anesthesia, and the injury to the abdominal wall, have been superadded. Last summer you may remember having seen me explore the abdomen of a young woman. It was distended by malignant tumours of both ovaries. In order to reheve the distension and prevent a speedy ending from intestinal obstruction, I deliberately removed the largest of the tumours. The haemorrhage was, as I had foreseen, furious. However, it was controlled with clamps and gauze. The patient survived for nine weeks. I can recall another case in which the removal of a large malignant tumour of the ovary prolonged the patient's life for two years. An old lady had a very soUd and immovable tumour tilling the lower abdomen. When brought into view it looked maHgnant, and both Dr. Griffiths and I thought at first that it could not be removed. However, I faced the risk and succeeded. Two years later a growth appeared in the ischio-rectal fossa, became infected from the rectum, and led to septicaemia.

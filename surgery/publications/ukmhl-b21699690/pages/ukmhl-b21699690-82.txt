70 RECOGNITION AND MANAGEMENT OF are safe, and often give the clearest information. Let me give some instances which can be recalled. An infant, eetat. three years, was sent up with the intimation that she had intussusception. When seen, the clinical signs fitted well with this diagnosis ; no flatus or faeces had been passed for forty-eight hours. The abdomen was slightly distended ; vomiting was frequent and persistent; the child cried out with pain, and put her hands upon the abdomen, where an obscure swelling could be felt. An enema was ordered, and arrangements made to open the abdomen if it failed. A motion followed the enema, and it ultimately became clear that the child had tuberculous meningitis. Doubtless the swelling felt in the abdomen consisted of tuberculous glands. I can also recall the case of an elderly lady who had had for many hours inability to pass flatus or faeces. Her breast was the seat of an ulce- rated scirrhus, and her lower extremities were paralysed. The abdomen was extraordinarily tense and distended. The obstruction had been preceded by constipation, and had come on gradually. As there was no clear evidence of a permanent mechani- cal cause for the obstruction, and as there was a possibility of its being paralytic, enemas were tried whilst preparations were being made to perform laparotomy. It was evident that such severe obstruction would only yield to strenuous efforts, and therefore an anaesthetic was administered whilst the enemas were being given. A fair passage

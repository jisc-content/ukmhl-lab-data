CLINICAL REASONING 38 operation I saw her in the month of June, which was the fourth month after her appendix had been removed, and she was then of opinion that she had made a perfect recovery, and was very much better than she had been for a long time. So, clearly, we were upon the right tack. I heard nothing of her for six months, when I was asked to go and see her. I was told that a month before she had been seized with pain in the region of her liver. In addition to that she had had shiverings, and her pulse had been rapid, so that it was when I saw her 120 or 130. In addition, her temperature had ranged continuously high, and was almost 103Â° F. She was exceedingly ill, and was obviously going to die unless something occurred. I proceeded to reason in the following way. First of all, ' The patient's present illness, whatever it is, is obviously caused by serious septic absorption. If you doubt that fact, look at her pulse-rate and her temperature. But we ought to have a little more information, which can be easily obtained ; we ought to know what her blood- count is.' Afterwards I was told that her leucocy- tosis amounted to at least 20,000, and perhaps a little more. So we were getting clear evidence of a serious septic absorption.

So I went a step

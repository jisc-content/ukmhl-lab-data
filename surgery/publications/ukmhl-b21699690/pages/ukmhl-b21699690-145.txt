I believe that there is an idea abroad that these duct cancers are less malignant than the other kinds, which oftener grow in the breast. But my own clinical and pathological experience leads me to think that that is a dangerous delusion. For instance, a woman had a small duct carcinoma of the right breast. This, together with a part of the mammary gland, was removed by a surgeon, who considered that he was dealing with a favourable form of carcinoma. Two years later a recurrence necessitated the removal of the remainder of the breast, together with a part of two ribs and the subjacent pleura.

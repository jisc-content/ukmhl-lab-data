94 THE ESSENTIALS OF A DIAGNOSIS was a friend of his, and I have just of late heard that the medical man has been laid up with an acute and rather severe attack of colon bacillus cystitis. It is a curious coincidence, at all events, and worth taking into account. Now as to words which are supposed to connote a disease, and which do not.

That is what the dictionary means by forming a diagnosis, from the history, the history helping in the diagnosis.

INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION 81 ceased to pass wind or faeces, vomited, and began to get distended. No cause could be discovered. The intestines were soon in a state of violent peristalsis. With a stethoscope gurglings and ' g^^ggl"^g^ ' could have been heard all over the belly. The temperature was normal. The pulse eighty-five, and of full volume. The skin was moist. After a while the intestines became stiller, and the distension markedly increased. Then at last the abdomen was very stiU and quiet. Nothing was heard with the stethoscope. The skin was now dry, the temperature slightly raised, but the pulse 140 and difficult to count. What is the interpreta- tion of such a case ? First, a mechanical obstruc- tion ; second, a huge peristaltic effort to overcome the obstructionâ€”with the pulse and perspiration which accompany exertion ; third, muscular exhaus- tion and paralysis with dilatation of the intestines ; fourth, peritonitis starting at the strangulated loop, which had by that time become gangrenous. As I have already pointed out, the presence of peri- tonitis causes the most absolute intestinal immobility. I always consider it a hopeful sign if vermicular movements can be seen before the operation is begun. It is clear evidence of the absence of paralysis and of peritonitis. We now come to the second part of my com- munication, namely, the management of a case of intestinal obstruction. Some of the most essential points have already been touched upon.

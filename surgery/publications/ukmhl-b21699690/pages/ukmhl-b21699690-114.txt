102 THE ESSENTIALS OF A DIAGNOSIS various examples that I have given you of inflam- mation of the scalp, inflammation of the vulva, and, we will say, of the bladder ? I think the con- clusion is this, that you may lay it down as an axiom that the diagnosis of an infective condition is not a diagnosis until you know what that infection is. That means a great deal. It means that we are brought in contact with an inflamed condition due to an infection : not only have we to proceed on clinical lines to determine what organ is inflamed and to what extent, but we have to determine what the cause of that inflammation is ; and that means rather a difficult, perhaps a prolonged and extensive, line of investigation. And I cannot help remembering that not infrequently when I have ventured to argue that this was right, I have been met with the argument that these things are impos- sible in practice. But I put it to you, gentlemen, if you think they are right you know they are not impossible. There are excellent clinical laboratories now springing up in all parts of this great city, and, indeed, in all parts of the country, and so it is not impossible. It may be troublesome, and it may be expensive, but surely if you, after thinking over the matter, have made up your minds that it is right, I am quite sure you will carry it out. I trust I have made myself clear, but I have been attempt- ing what, to an individual like myself, is particularly difficult, and that is to discuss the meaning of a medical term.

104 INFECTION OF LYMPHATIC GLANDS disaster, and the attempt is sure to end in making the patient desperately ill; it is almost certain to end in increasing his sufferings. Now there is another reason why I think it right to speak upon this subject, and it is to draw your attention to some- thing which you can do now, and which you cannot easily do hereafter. You will agree with me that your knowledge of the anatomy of the lymphatics and of the lymphatic glands is vague. First of all, the subject is not very fully treated of in the text- books of anatomy usually placed in your hands ; and in the next place, in the dissecting-room the lymphatics are not easy to see. You may discern the largest lymphatic glands, and you may see the smaller ones if they are enlarged, but many of the lymphatic glands which are apt to be infected in the course of cancer are not seen at all in the dissecting-room. They may be too small, and as I shall presently show you, they are in numerous out-of-the-way places. Next as regards the lym- phatic channels. Who sees the lymphatic channels ? I venture to think that there are many gentlemen in this room who have passed their College examina- tion, and perhaps their Fellowship, and probably the only lymphatic chamiel they have seen has been the thoracic duct. And I venture to think that they have not seen that very easily and well. The reason is, that the lymphatic channels are exceedingly small, they have very thin walls, and when they are collapsed they are very difficult to

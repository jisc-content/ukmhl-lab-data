CARCINOMA OF THE BREAST 130 The operator having seen the dread disease with scientific certainty, is nerved for a long and arduous toil, for it is requisite to take away the entire mam- mary gland,the pectoral muscles and their sheaths, the axillary fat and lymphatics, and the axillary fascia. Having discussed the time, let us now turn to the manner in which the lymphatics become involved in cancer of the breast. The presence of growths in the lymphatic vessels themselves cannot be seen during operations, except occasionally, in very advanced cases. More than once in neglected ones, and upon which I have been reluctantly compelled to operate, I have seen small, hard, white, knotted strings running through the inter- costal spaces towards the anterior mediastinum. But, ordinarily, the lymphatics are removed along with the muscles, fasciae, and fat, and without any microscopic evidence of cancer within their channels. Afterwards microscopic evidence of its presence may be, and often has been, obtained. We turn, therefore, to the effects of the carcinoma upon the glands along the course of the lymphatics. Probably the first and most obvious effect produced is enlargement. Now, there is to my mind something very strange about this enlargement. I have over and over again chosen the largest from a group of enlarged axillary glands from a case of cancer of the breast, and have failed to identify cancerous cells or structures within its capsule, and this is quite an ordinary experience.

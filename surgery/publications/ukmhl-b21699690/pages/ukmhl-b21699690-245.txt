EXPLORATORY LAPAROTOMY 227 intestine, gall-bladder, or urinary bladder, are slow in spreading. This explains why I have seen a man in com- paratively good health two years after I had per- formed gastro-enterostomy for a tumour which obstructed the pylorus, and why some who have had inguinal colotomy performed for carcinoma of the rectum live so long, and in reasonable comfort. Therefore, there is much to be said in favour of exploratory laparotomy when it is followed by a palliative operation such as gastro-enterostomy. But after the palliative operation has been successfully achieved the future has to be faced. Should the disease be innocent, or should it be very slow in progress, then all is justified. But, obviously, such endings cannot be foretold. At times an exploration reveals disease whose effects can be palliated for a time, but which must inevitably lead to a not far distant and painful ending.

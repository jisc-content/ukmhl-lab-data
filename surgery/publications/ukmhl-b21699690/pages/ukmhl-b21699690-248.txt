230 EXPLORATORY LAPAROTOMY its presence or absence. But I believe that it occurs when the growth is spreading into the parietal peritoneum. For instance, a patient had intense pain and tenderness beneath the upper end of the right rectus abdominis. At this spot a malignant tumour in the left lobe of the liver was found adherent to the abdominal wall by recent adhesions ; these were undone and the pain ceased. Or again, a very painful and tender spot to the left of the umbilicus marked the place where a malignant tumour of the transverse colon was adhering to the parietal peritoneum.

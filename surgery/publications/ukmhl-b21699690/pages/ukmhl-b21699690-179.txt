VARICOSE VEINS 161 into consideration. I have not time to go into the question of the causation of ulceration now, but, nevertheless, you ought to begin to consider tlie subject. I tliink tliat in varix the way in which the ulcer occurs is this : I have already remarked that the blood in varicose veins stagnates and does not pass on. It stagnates, not only in the main vein, but if you look at the ordinary case of varix which you see in the surgery, or in the out-patients' department, you will see the patches in which it is stagnating in the small veins. Now, an individual, in order to live, must have a supply of food ; he must have a supply of oxygen, and be able to excrete his carbonic acid gas, and so on. But the existence of the cells and tissues of the body depends upon the same conditions being fulfilled. If the blood is stagnating in the veins, how can the tissues get food and oxygen or get rid of their waste products ? Of course they asphyxiate, and starve, and poison themselves. A person either dies as a whole or he dies in little pieces. If he dies in little pieces, that is called ulceration ; if he dies in little lumps, you call it sloughing; if the whole limb dies, it is gangrene. We are concerned now with ulcera- tion, in which it dies in little pieces. There are some other complications which we have already considered. We will speak next of the question of haemorrhage. Haemorrhage is not rare. It may occur from an ulcer, but often from a vein which is so thin that it is able to burst. LOCKWOOD TVr

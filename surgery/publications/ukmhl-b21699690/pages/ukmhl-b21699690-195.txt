INGUINAL SWELLINGS 177 was empty. In the left inguinal region he had a swelling, and the question was, Is that swelling inside or outside the inguinal canal ? We sus- pected it was a testicle. I guessed it was outside the inguinal canal. We thought we could feel the aponeurosis of the external oblique under- neath the swelhng. At the operation this proved to be the case. Whether the testicle had ever passed into the scrotum I cannot tell, but it had turned back over the aponeurosis of the external oblique, and covered over the inguinal canal. As you may be aware, the first step in the transition of the testis is the passage of a sort of test-tube of peritoneum down from the abdomen into the scrotum, and then the testicle follows that, descend- ing into the test-tube. Sometimes the test-tube, or processus vaginalis, passes back over the external oblique without the presence of the testicle at all. For instance, on Monday I operated on a small boy who had his testicle in the abdomen, but the processus vaginalis had passed down the inguinal canal, and turned up again in the external oblique towards the anterior superior spine of the ilium. To revert to the question of femoral hernia over the inguinal canal, a condition which is not always very easy to diagnose. In a thin person it may be easy, because you can feel the neck of the hernia running outside the spine of the pubes and below Poupart's ligament into the saphenous opening and towards the femoral canal.

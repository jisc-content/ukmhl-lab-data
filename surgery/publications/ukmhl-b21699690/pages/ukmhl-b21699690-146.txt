128 CARCINOMA OF THE BREAST rencc, but in most cases it is more rational to say that the cancer left behind went on growing. Per- haps some think that duct cancer is more favourable, simply because it is removed earlier than other kinds. The sanious discharge from the nipple alarms the most careless, and impels them to seek advice. Another instance shows not only that the lym- phatics are involved at the earliest stages of cancer of the breast, but also that the growths in them may soon grow bigger than the one from which they sprung. A woman had a small, hard, movable nodule beneath the lower margin of the left areola. It was explored, and found to be a carcinoma. The nodule was barely half an inch across, but it sent out small prolongations. Some fullness could be seen in the axilla, and moderately enlarged glands could be felt beneath the great pectoral muscles. But when the breast and pectoral muscles had been removed, a very large mass of cancerous glands was unexpectedly met with. Such cases as these prove that from the earliest beginnings of cancer of the breast the disease has attacked the lymphatics. Although I have for a long time looked upon a carcinoma as a sort of lymphatic sponge with cancer cells growing in its meshes, yet the early spread into the surrounding lymphatics did not become clear to me until I had begun to make immediate microscopical exami- nations of even the smallest and most innocent- looking tumours of the breast, and to follow this

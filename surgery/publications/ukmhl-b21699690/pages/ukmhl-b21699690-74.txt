62 INTRA-ABDOMINAL INFLAMMATION fixed. The muscles become rigid and taut and tend to prevent the inflamed structures of the joint being moved or stretched. Exactly the same thing occurs in the abdomen. The muscles of the abdo- minal wall become rigid to protect the inflamed tissue underneath. In consequence of that muscular rigidity curious mistakes may occur. I have often seen the protective rigidity which takes place at the upper end of the rectus mistaken for the gall- bladder and for tumours of the pylorus. When this muscular rigidity occurs on the right side of the abdomen it is not unusual for it to be mistaken for appendicular abscess. I think most of these mistakes can easily be avoided, first of all by remem- bering how fallacious these signs may be, and secondly, by an examination under anaesthesia. Also, if there were a distended gall-bladder there you might possibly find dullness, but carcinoma is also dull ; appendicular abscess is as a rule, but it may not be. I think if you exercise a little caution you will not be deluded by that. But when you encounter this abdominal rigidity, which indicates so clearly that there is something inflamed underneath, do not be too sure of the nature of the structure which is underneath. I have seen some very curious mistakes made. On Friday there was a patient whom we knew had a septic kidney. We knew that because there was pus in his urine ; we could see the pus emerging from the left ureter. We saw the retraction of the left ureter, which is also an indica-

176 INGUINAL SWELLINGS proceed to consider some swellings above the neck of the scrotum. The patient having been stood up in a good light and told to cough, we will assume that you see a swelling in the region of the inguinal canal ; that is to say, it is opposite the inner third of Poupart's ligament. When the patient coughs there is a sharp, distinct impulse. The probabilities in your mind in a case of that sort would be that the tumour is a hernia. But I advise you not to put that proposition first. I advise you to say to yourself that there is a swelling above the neck of the scrotum and in the region of the inguinal canal, and then say to yourself, I will now try to ascertain whether that swelling is outside or inside the inguinal canal. You will be very puzzled some day with a swelling in that region which is not in the inguinal canal, but outside it. It is, of course, a foolish mistake to begin to operate on a supposed swelling in the inguinal canal and to find that after all you are dealing with, say, a chronic abscess over the inguinal canal, or an enlarged gland. There may be other things over the inguinal canal. For instance, besides the tumours I have mentioned, a femoral hernia, not infrequently after leaving the saphenous opening, turns up over Poupart's ligament and lodges over the inguinal canal. Another structure which sometimes passes over the ingumal canal is the testicle itself. You may have seen a boy operated upon last week in whom we thought this had happened.

INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION 73 ning to tear, the muscular coat paralysed, and the mucous ulcerated. An artificial opening has to be made forthwith. Enormous quantities of liquid fffices escape, and continue to flow until the patient succumbs. Inasmuch as the faecal discharge does not take place by the natural passage this is not called a death from exhaustion brought about by purging, but is not infrequently attributed to the operation. Now the mortahty from inguinal colo- tomy performed under favourable conditions cannot exceed one or two per cent., whilst under the fore- going it is extremely fatal. On the other hand enemas are safe. If they fail, the fluid is on the right side of the obstruction, and merely comes back again. The faintness, vomiting, or the erythema which occasionally follow enemas need hardly be taken into consideration ; neither a medical man nor an experienced nurse is likely to injure the rectum. The test may be considered satisfactory if two enemas have been tried without anaesthesia and one during anaesthesia. In intestinal obstruction the non-passage of flatus or of faeces is speedily followed by abdominal distensionâ€”with the advent of distension the gravity of the case is immeasurably increased. Its presence diminishes the chances of relief by enemas. As the late Grieg Smith argued, the tightly dis- tended coils of intestine obstruct one another. Next, it is difficult or impossible after distension

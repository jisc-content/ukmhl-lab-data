138 CARCINOMA OF THE BREAST breast along lymphatic channels which join with those of the abdomen mainly through the epigastric angle. Any one who realizes this must of necessity remove the lymphatic-bearing fascia which lies over the juncture of the great pectoral muscle and aponeurosis of the rectus abdominis. Indeed, in my later operations the rectus aponeurosis itself has been removed, bringing into view the fleshy origins of the muscle from the costal cartilages. This entails but a trifling addition to the extent of the operation, and would be amply repaid if the risks of intra-abdominal growth be lessened by it. The mammary gland is so widespread that it is not very far from the epigastric angle, and therefore, as every scrap of gland tissue has to be removed, but a slight extension of the incision is necessary. I now come to the spread of carcinoma of the breast into the axilla. All will agree that this is usually as follows : First, it spreads into the pectoral group of axillary lymphatic glands, and which are so easily felt when enlarged at the lower edge of the pectoralis major. Thence the growth passes onwards into the glands about the uppermost part of the axfllary vein, and thence onwards into the subclavian. As the growth progresses, other groups become involvedâ€”that about the subscapular artery and vein, that about the lower end of the axillary and upper end of the brachial vessels. But in practice it is unsafe to assume that the lymphatics become cancerous in regular anatomical sequence.

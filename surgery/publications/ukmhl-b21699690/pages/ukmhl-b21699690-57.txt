Ill THE COURSE OE INTRA-ABDOMINAL INFLAMMATION Last week I endecavoured to show you that the cUagnosis of a cUnical case included various steps. First, there is the iDrocess of making clear observa- tions with your own senses, above all with your eyes, and to some extent with your hands. Next, that from these observations inferences were to be drawn. And then, when you had collected all the inferences that could be drawn from the case you ought to reason from those inferences, and that the ultimate end of the reasoning brought about the diagnosis. To perform all these mental acts correctly requires, of course, a long period of train- ing. You get this training by seizing every oppor- tunity of using your eyes and other senses, and the correct methods of inference you can acquire by watching the process as performed by others and continually correcting your own mistakes. Of course the process of drawing a general conclusion from your inferences necessitates considerable mental aptitude, and you will only acquire that by long and continuous reflection.

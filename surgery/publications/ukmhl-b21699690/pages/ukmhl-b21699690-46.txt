I was called in to see the lady with the view to the removal of her left kidney, which was the kidney which was supposed to have in it an abscess, and which was thought to be a useless organ, and, moreover, a source of danger to the patient. I had to ask myself, ' What do my senses tell me about this patient ? ' The only thing which I knew for a fact was that I had seen a quantity of pus, say ten per cent., in her urine. Next, the pus must have come from her kidney or her ureter, for a very simple reason. If the pus is from the bladder it is usually mixed with mucus—in other words, it is muco-pus.

CARCINOMA OF THE BREAST 143 brachial glands could not be felt, although greatly enlarged, because the patient was so fat. It is to be supposed that these brachial glands became cancerous by a process of growth from the axillary and pectoral ones. This would imply that the growth had taken place against the lymph stream, and past a number of lymphatic valves. But there is another possibility. In Poirier (p. 238) we find it said : ' It is not rare to see a vessel, no matter from which of the lymphatic territories it may spring, end in a glandular group other than that which represents the usual terminus of the collectors of the territory in question ; thus Nagel has seen one of the trunks coming from the subareolar plexus send a branch to a humeral gland before terminating in the supero-internal thoracic glands.' Presumably this is not a very common occurrence, but neither is marked enlargement of the humeral, or brachial glands as they are better called. There is yet another group of axillary glands situated over the subscapular vessels. But these are not at all likely to escape notice, and are removed as an invariable part of a modern operation. I have not seen the subscapular glands separately enlarged. But the growth of cancer in them may add to the difficulties of the operation, and render it less efficacious. I have already spoken of a case in which a cystic adenoma was removed from the left breast and

INGUINAL SWELLINGS 190 promise to put it outside the abdominal ring, but it is not a very satisfactory place to put it into. But often you can put it down into the scrotum. When the testis is turned back over the external oblique it goes well into the scrotum. What becomes of the testicle when it is put into the scrotum ?

And that I am afraid will not be done. Observe this is a very important problem, and that prac- tically a great many questions will turn upon it.

The fluid which came out, it is true, was not fsecal, but it was a fluid which inflamed the abdominal wall, and of course kept the patient in a continual state of great discomfort. On this second occasion I opened the abdomen and again found a cyst, but of a very much smaller extent, and after enormous labour I traced this cyst down to the pelvis, and ended by ligaturing what I believed to be the pedicle of an ovarian cyst growing from the right ovary ; but, however this may be, the question of an intes- tinal leak remained.

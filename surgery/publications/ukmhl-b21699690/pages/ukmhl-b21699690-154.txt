136 CARCINOMA OF THE BREAST in this case of mastitis and carcinoma were much at variance. Here is another fact which ought to make us cautious in thinking that the onset of cancer in the other breast is always due to lymphatic trans- mission, though it may be. I have told you about a case in which a portion of the chest wall was removed for recurrent duct carcinoma of the right breast. Within four months a carcinoma had grown in the left breast, but it was a spheroidal- celled carcinoma undergoing colloid change. Here it is difficult to suppose that a particle of the duct carcinoma had been carried across. But then, again, it may be quite wrong to look for a particulate cause for the various histological kinds of cancer. And here for a moment I may perhaps be allowed to digress, and say that it is rash to infer that when tumours grow in both mammary glands they will be of the same variety. For example, I removed from the right breast, a cystic fibro-adenoma. Five years later another small tumour grew in the left breast. Although clinically it was exactly like the previous one, yet it proved to be a spheroidal-celled carcinoma. Again, a cancerous tumour had been removed from the right breast by a partial and futile operation. The tumour speedily grew again, but seemed yet within the possibility of complete removal. But whilst the carcinoma was growing in the remains of the right breast a tumour had appeared in the left.

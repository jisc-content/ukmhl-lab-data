IN DISEASE OF THE TONGUE 105 3ee and find. The knowledge of the distribution of the lymphatic channels is gained in two ways. One is by injecting the lymphatics with something. Sappey was one of the first who really made a mark at this subject, and he worked assiduously at the lymphatics by injecting them with mercury. And if any one is in Paris they should go to the Dupuy- tren Museum, where they will see his beautiful specimens. When I was a pupil of Dr. Klein, many years ago, we used to inject the lymphatic glands with Prussian blue; a hjrpodermic needle was passed into the gland and a solution of Prussian blue was forced into it, and it went along the lym- phatic channels. Later the method of injecting dyes has been further elaborated by Gerota, who has added considerably to our knowledge. But now I am going to tell you another way in which you should acquire a knowledge of the lymphatic glands, and often in my experience it is better and more useful than anatomical methods. I mean the clinical method. For instance, I shall shortly tell you about a lymphatic gland which you ought ahvays to look for, but which in the latest work on the lymphatic glands is only marked in one of the pictures as, I think, a lymphatic nodule on the track of the lymphatics (vide Fig. 2, e). And if any of you wish to pursue this very important subject further, I would draw your attention to a book which was issued towards the end of last year on the subject. It is called The Lymphatics, and it is

F^CAL LEAKS AND FISTULA 247 favourable cases for several reasons, first of all as the kind of fistula is known and the kind ot trau- matism is known.

Next, I would refer to those which are due to chronic infective diseases. For instance, there are tuberculous or actinomy- cotic. Not long since we had one in the hospital in which bilharzia was the cause of the leak ; and, lastly, there are those which are due to carcinoma. This is a clinical lecture, and one of the objects of this clinical lecture is to make you think, and out of one's own experience try to convey to you ideas of what will happen in cases with which you will, perhaps, shortly be brought into contact. Now, I have placed these cases in the order of their cura- bility. The cases which are due to acute infective diseases, get well, most of them recover, and if they do not get well they are more amenable to treatment ; but those which are due to chronic infective diseases, like tubercle, and like actinomycosis, bilharzia, or

76 RECOGNITION AND MANAGEMENT OF there is a clear passage throughout the intes- tines. I fear there are some who do not recognize that when the passage through the bowels is obstructed, flatulent distension is sure to occur. But a glance at colon bacilli growing in a tube of gelatin would speedily clear up any lingering doubt. At each colony of bacilli is a little bubble of gas produced by the bacilli themselves. The gas is evolved with speed, and continuously. Now think of the count- less numbers of the intestinal bacteria and try to imagine the effects of their activity. No wonder the intestines distend so quickly, and no wonder the distension is so continuous and so uncontrollable. Clearly the speedy onset of distension has to be taken into consideration in the management of cases of intestinal obstruction. If the patient be seen before it has supervened, the seat and cause of the obstruction may be ascertained. A tumour, for instance, may be felt in the sigmoid flexure, the colon, or in the right iliac fossa. And perhaps at this point I may be allowed to interject that the search for the cause of obstruction is sometimes pursued with a lack of method. I myself usually follow the course of the intestinal tract from the anus to the mouth. The rectal and vaginal examina- tions have demonstrated the presence of impacted faeces, of carcinomatous stricture of the rectum, of intussusception, of carcinoma of the uterus filHng the pelvis, or of extensive pelvic inflammation

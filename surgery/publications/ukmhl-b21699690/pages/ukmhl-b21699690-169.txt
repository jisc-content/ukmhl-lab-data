151 VARICOSE VEINS a disease and that you should be able to name the disease, but I have also told you that it is essential that you should be able to put yourself in the patient's place and have an idea in your mind how the disease is afiecting the patientâ€”in other words, have an idea what he feels like, and what trouble the condition is giving to him, how much it is interfering with his happiness and comfort. I have so often asked the students to tell me what effect these varicose veins have upon the patient, and have been unable to elicit an answer, that I suspect I am right to-day in discussing it with you. First of all, let us take the matter of the diagnosis of varicose veins. It seems so simple that you must all think that no question could arise. But I have myself seen a patient with varix of the internal saphenous vein wearing a femoral truss, and I have afterwards operated and removed the dilated vein. As you are aware, the internal saphe- nous vein, before its entry into the common femoral vein, has an ampulla or dilatation upon it, and under certain circumstances, sometimes in females who have been pregnant, the vein at that point becomes locally dilated. Here is a swelling in the region of a femoral hernia which swells out when the patient stands up, departs when she lies down, has an impulse when the patient coughs, and, in fact, is exceedingly like a femoral hernia. I do not think that anybody ought to mistake a dilatation of the ampulla of the saphenous vein for a femoral hernia,

82 RECOGNITION AND MANAGEMENT OF it is clear that, inasmuch as intestinal obstruction is inevitably fatal, there should be no pause or cessation in the endeavour to procure relief. I am of opinion that it is the duty of medical men to remain with the patient until relief is obtained. I am fully aware that some may be startled by this proposition, but see how it works out. The patient has passed no flatus and no fseces for some hours or days. Perhaps some of the other signs of obstruction are added. An enema is given, and fails ; a second likewise fails. Aid is sent for at once, and an anaesthetic is given ; possibly another enema is tried, and fails. Then laparotomy is performed under the most favourable conditions, that is to say, before intestinal distension and paralysis, and, of course, long before the peritoneum is inflamed and cracked, or the mucous membrane ulcerated, or before gangrene has supervened. When this line of management cannot be carried out at the patient's home, an immediate start should be made for the hospital or nursing home. In about half the cases, by systematic investiga- tion, cause can be found to explain the obstruction. This cause has forthwith to be dealt with. For instance, fsecal impaction may be found, and reheved with enemas. If these are unsatisfactory, they may be tried again after an anaesthetic has been given. We have already had instances of the success in cases of paralytic distension. But obviously obstruction caused by growths in the

180 INGUINAL SWELLINGS to its boundaries, would be a source of difficulty to your mind. You would say such a man had got a varicose condition of the veins in the neck of the scrotum and in the inguinal canal. Now, consider another condition which I have often seen. I have seen many times no scrotal varicocele, no varicocele in the neck of the scrotum, but a marked varicose condition of the spermatic veins in the inguinal canal. And this is a very puzzling condition, and the diagnosis of it is exceedingly difficult. The possibility of its presence is not recognized, and I suppose, therefore, it is not diagnosed. I wonder how many people are wearing trusses upon inguinal varicoceles, and I further wonder how many people are complaining of the pain and discomfort which that entails. It is of the greatest importance to diagnose inguinal vari- cocele. For instance, I remember seeing a patient who had an inguinal varicocele. I guessed that he had inguinal varicocele for these reasons. Fu:st of all, he had a Uttle swelling in the region of his inguinal canal. This swelling became greater when he stood up. Next, the sweUing had an obvious impulse when he coughed, so that it was m that respect very like a hernia. Next, the sweUing went away when he lay down, but slowly. Next he had a dilated inguinal canal. I might have said it was an inguinal hernia, but he had some slight dilata- tion of the veins in the neck of the scrotum and, I think, also in the veins of the pampiniform plexus.

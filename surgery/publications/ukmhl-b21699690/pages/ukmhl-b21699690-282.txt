DIACNOSTS OF TUMOURS 264 of tissue came away in the cannula. This was part of a malignant growth. To me this discovery was a complete surprise. The testicle was removed and the diagnosis fully confirmed. 1 can adduce two other instances in which a swelling of the testicle was thought to be inflammatory, and treated as such, and ultimately found to be sarcomatous. Oddly enough, both occurred in cases in which the testicles had not undergone complete transition. In one, the left testicle had stopped just outside the external abdominal ring ; and in the other both testicles were retained, the right in the abdomen and the left in the inguinal canal. The latter was the one which I removed, but some months after- wards an abdominal tumour appeared and carried off the patient. It was supposed to have originated in the right retained testicle. I could continue to give instances of erroneous clinical diagnosis of tumours, but surely enough have been mentioned to explain my own mental attitude towards the ordinary clinical diagnosis. It is, however, to be noted that all the examples that have been given are ones of recognized difficulty. Fortunately there are instances in which the clinical diagnosis is unerr- ing ; as, for example, when we find a hard nodule in the epididymis, together with similar ones in the prostate and vesiculae seminales ; and perhaps pus and tubercle bacilli in the urine. But I have been speaking of tumours in which corroborative evidence is lacking, and the tumour has to be considered

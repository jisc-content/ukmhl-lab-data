54 INTRA-ABDOMINAL INFLAMMATION I have referred to some of the signs of intra- abdominal inflammation. If any gentleman in this theatre, after what I have said, is deluded by that pain in the middle of the abdomen, he is past forgiveness. The ordinary place for abdominal pain to begin is in the centre of the abdomen. If it is appendicitis, the patient will place it after a while in the right iliac fossa. If the patient has inflamed Fallopian tubes, or an inflamed uterus, or an inflamed ovarian cyst in the pelvis, then, after a while, the patient will place it low down in the abdomen. If it is a septic gall-bladder, the patient will probably place the pain under the right costal arch. Or if it is a septic kidney, with an inflammation of that organ, the pain will be placed after a while in the flank. And in almost all the instances I have given you there is a period in the disease when the patient refers his pain to the centre of the abdomen. There is an obvious reason for that, founded upon a correct appreciation of the anatomy of the solar plexus, a portion of the anatomy of the human body which is singularly neglected, and which will repay any gentleman to work at for his thesis. The locaHty of the pain may continue doubtful although you have tried to locate it many times. I recall the case of a lady whom I saw yesterday, who was supposed to have had a septic gall-bladder and gall-stones, which was afterwards found to be true. She was asked where the pain was, and she put her hand anywhere down the right side of the abdomen.

EXPLORATORY LAPAROTOMY 221 found scattered throughout the whole abdomen. An especially large mass was felt behind the stomach and transverse meso-colon. The place of origin of this growth was never known. But I remember well declining to guess how long the patient would live, and it was perhaps as well that I did so. After the operation the fluid did not re-accumulate for many months, and a comparatively active life was led. In the end, death ensued two years after the exploration. In another case of very extensive irremovable malignant disease beginning in the ovary the patient lived for a year after an explo- ration. Perhaps both were exceptional in their tenacity of life. Probably not more than from three to six months elapse between the exploration and fatal ending when mahgnant disease is found in the great omentum or other parts of the peri- toneum. And this leads me to remark that malignant disease of the great omentum is not an unusual cause of ascites. Cancer of the great omentum is one of the deepest mysteries of a mysterious disease. It is remarkable, too, what masses of growth the abdomen may hold without their presence being revealed to the sense of touch. At times the masses are hidden by the fluid, but at others they rest upon the intestines as upon an air-cushion, so that they merely retreat when pressed upon. This was clearly seen during an operation in which great lumps of cancer were found in the omentum, but coula not

XII FiECAL LEAKS AND FISTULA A HUMAN being whose intestinal contents are escaping through an artificial opening upon the surface of the body is a very unhappy person. He will submit to severe and dangerous operations to be rid of his trouble. My observation leads me to think that fsecal leaks and fsecal fistulas are commoner than they used to be. Perhaps that is because so many more incisions are made into the abdomen for the purposes of opening abscesses, and after an abscess within the abdomen—and especially after a neglected abscess within the abdomen—a ' fsecal leak ' often ensues. I use the expressions ' faecal leak ' and ' fsecal fistula ', but I do not know that they are quite correct. ' Intestinal leak ' and ' intestinal fistula ' would, on many occasions, be more correct, because that which comes out, and upon the nature of which the classification is obviously based, is not always faecal. For instance, the fiuid which escapes from the duodenum is certainly not faecal, and the fluid which escapes from the jejunum is certainly not fsecal; it does not become fsecal until the

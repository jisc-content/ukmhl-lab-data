86 INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION tines which had been distended were unequal to the propulsion of their contents after the fibroid tumour had been removed. The patient's life was saved by the prompt performance of typhlotomy. Few surgeons could hope to be so successful under such desperate circumstances. In some classes of case it seems now to be well recognized throughout the profession that prompt measures afford excellent chances of recovery. This is notably so with regard to strangulated hernia and intussusception, but it is clear from the figures which I have given that intestinal obstruction in which the obvious cause is not discovered does not yet receive the same prompt attention.

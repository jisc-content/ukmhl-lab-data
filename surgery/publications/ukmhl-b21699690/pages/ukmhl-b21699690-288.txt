270 DIAGNOSIS OF TUMOURS squamous-celled carcinoma. A clean sweep was made of the growth, but it speedily grew again. Fortunately the efforts of surgery are not always so unavailing. The immediate microscopical examination is applicable to dubious ulcerations of mucous mem- branes. An ulcer of the cervix uteri was shown to be carcinomatous, and a growth which appeared in the roof of the vagina after the whole uterus had been removed was also carcinoma, and singu- larly like the growth which was removed from the cervix in the other case. It had originated in the cervix, and it is to be inferred that, although the whole uterus had been removed, a particle of growth had been left behind and had gone on growing. Some might be contented to say that the growth had ' recurred ', whatever that may mean ; but to me it seems better to face the fact that when the tumour grows again it has not been effectually removed. Ulcers of the tongue often present diffi- culties. A small, hard, circular ulcer of one of the foliate papillae was removed and found to be in- flammatory ; and yet another with similar charac- ters was epitheliomatous. A papilloma of the penis was epitheliomatous, although no growth could be felt in its base. This microscopical diagnosis enabled amputation to be done at an early stage of the disease. The immediate microscopical examination of tumours and of tissues has another very important

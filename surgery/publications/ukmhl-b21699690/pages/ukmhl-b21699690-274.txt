256 F/ICAL LEAKS AND FISTULiE There is another thing of paramount importance, when you are brought into contact with a faecal leak, which you should be dead certain about, and that is whether the alimentary tract is quite clear beyond the opening. You may lay it down as an axiom in surgery that no leak of any kind will get better if there is an obstruction in the canal. Whoever saw a perineal fistula get well until the stricture of the urethra was put right, or whoever saw a leak get well when there was a stricture of the intestine beyond the leak ? So you have to make your minds clear on that point. I cannot now go into the manner in which you would settle this important point. But if you have a principle in your mind, matters of detail will surely settle themselves. There is one other warning I give you about fsecal leaks. After what I have said you will take great pains to eliminate the possibility of some chronic infective disease being present. That is obvious. But go a step further and always examine persistent fsecal leaks under an ansesthetic, your object being to clear up the question of the presence of stricture or of chronic infective disease, and also to make sure that a foreign body has not been overlooked. I now have under my care a patient in whom silk had been left behind. I think he has two inches of continuous silk suture hidden away under the scar near the ftecal fistula. It is reasonable to suppose that it will not get well until that silk is got rid of.

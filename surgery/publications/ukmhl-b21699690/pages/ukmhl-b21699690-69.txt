INTRA-ABDOMINAL INFLAMMATION 57 into the rectum could feel the peritoneum, with nothing intervening between the peritoneum and the finger except the rectal wall. When the peritoneum was touched, it nearly made the man leap out of bed. There is no more tender structure in the human body than the inflamed parietal peritoneum. Per- haps the exposed pulp of a tooth is about as painful, but the peritoneum when inflamed is certainly the most exquisitely tender structure which the body contains. His abdomen was opened and it was found to be full of pus and contained a gangrenous appendix. He died, not many hours after the operation, from septic intoxication. I remember another circumstance in connexion with that case. After the operation, at night, his relatives appeared on the scene, and I said : ' I am going to take you to see your relative. He has had his operation performed, his abdomen has been cleared of the septic material, but he is going to die. Do not be deceived; he may laugh and talk to you with a good voice and be cheerful, but he will suddenly collapse and die. I regret to have to tell you this.' I knew this because he had a pulse which was continuously ascending after the operation. If it had fallen one might have felt hope, but it ascended to 140, and it was certain that his heart would not long endure that strain, and it was equally certain that his cheerful demeanour was due to septic intoxication. I could quote other cases in which the situation of the pain had been ambiguous.

PREFACE These Clinical Lectures and Addresses have already appeared in the columns of the British Medical Journal and of the Clinical Journal; and I desire to thank the Editors for the leave which they have so kindly given me to print them again. In spite of the rather colloquial style of some of them, I venture to do so, because so many of my friends and pupils have expressed a wish to have them in a form more convenient for reference. 19, Uppeb Bbkkeley Street, PORTMAN SqUAEE, W.

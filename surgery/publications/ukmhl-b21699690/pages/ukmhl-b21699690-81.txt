INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION 69 the obstruction is amenable to medical treatment ; and in the third whether surgical measures should be tried. The chances of successful surgical treat- ment are oftentimes lost because the first and second phases are so prolonged. Now let us try to answer these three questions ; but before proceeding let me refer for a moment to the title of this communication. The word recognition is used because in so many cases recogni- tion is all that can be achieved. A diagnosis cannot be made except by a surgical operation or post- mortem examination. Now the recogrution of intestinal obstruction is a simple matter. It is safe to assume that any one who cannot pass flatus or faeces has intestinal obstruction, and that death will ensue if neither escapes. At first this proposition may seem rather extreme. A person with constipation oftentimes passes no flatus or faeces for hours or days. But it is not that he cannot, but merely that he does not.

When the joint recovers, the movements return in due order, and those which were the first to depart are the last to return. Flexion and extension come back before adduction and abduction, and adduction and abduction before rotation. This is, I believe, a law for all joints which possess these movements. When the law is ignored and rotation is attempted before flexion and extension, great pain may be caused. The degree of danger may determine the order of the examination. The abdomen is first examined without ansesthesia ; then with the patient under an anesthetic ; and last, by means of an exploratory incision. I am accustomed to call this a surgical crescendo. The principle of progression from the easy to the difficult, from the painless to the painful, and from the safe to the dangerous pervades the whole of surgery. The principles of the surgical crescendo also apply to treatment. For example, in congenital equino-varus the baby's foot may be massaged and manipulated, next wrenched and put in plaster-of- Paris bandages; afterwards the plantar fascia may be cut, the tendons and Hgaments divided, and, at last, the astragalus or portions of the tarsus may be taken away.

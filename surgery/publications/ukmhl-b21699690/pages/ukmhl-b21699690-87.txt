INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION 75 probable that distension paralysis is established, a temporary opening has to be made in the caecum or small intestine. Some time ago I operated upon a man with intestinal obstruction and enormous abdominal distension. He was too ill to allow of more than relief by an opening into the caecum. A few days after this had been made his bowels acted and he recovered. I never heard the ultimate end of his case. Another man's life was clearly saved by an enormous escape of flatus and faeces from an accidental wound in the caecum. This had been sutured, but gave way, owing to the extreme tension. Not long ago I had occasion to regret that I did not open and drain the small intestine. I saw, with my friend Dr. Courtenay Drake, a patient who had got an appendicular abscess and very severe abdominal distension. The appendicular abscess was with difficulty found and emptied. The appendix was then looked for by separating the ileo-caecal junction. Whilst this was being done a quantity of gas escaped, and considerably relieved the distension. After the operation relief was obtained by enemas, but not in an adequate degree. I feel sure now that the opening at the ileo-caecal junction ought to have been enlarged and a drain inserted. Owing to the fluidity of the faecal flow, artificial openings into the caecum and ileum are especially repulsive, and only to be made with extreme reluctance. Nevertheless they have a remarkable tendency to close themselves, provided

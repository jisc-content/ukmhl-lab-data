ON A CASE OF GANGRENE OF THE LEG I I 5 completely lost over the dark purple area above mentioned, the toes were becoming shrivelled ; there was still no pulse in the left femoral, but the pulse could be again felt in the right femoral artery. On examining the amputated left leg, which you see before you, you will notice that it is an example of dry gangrene; there is mummification of the toes, and discoloration above that, extending up to the middle of the leg; at the posterior part the skin is ap- parently healthy, and at the point where it was amputated the tissues look quite healthy.

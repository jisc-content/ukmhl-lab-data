I need hardly say what a boon that was to dentists, and to the patients who had to ^ resort to dentists. Accordingly, nitrous oxide gas became the fashionable means of producing anesthesia for dental and other short operations. But then it was thought that if it was possible to put a patient ofF quickly with nitrous oxide gas, why should you not go on administering ether afterwards, and so keep up the anesthesia ; and, accordingly, that is what we do nowadays.

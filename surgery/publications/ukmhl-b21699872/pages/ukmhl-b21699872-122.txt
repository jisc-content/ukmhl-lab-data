I06 ON AMPUTATION FOR aggravated, as it so often is, by diarrhcBa; and in cases of this kind you notice very great emaciation, and also that the patient will pass high-coloured urine, which is somewhat scanty in quantity. The pathology of hectic fever has been a matter of considerable dispute. Hectic fever does not occur until the discharge of pus from the surface ; the mere fact of having a large chronic abscess, such as occurs in joint disease or disease of the vertebrae does not produce hectic fever; but the moment you open that abscess, or allow it to burst, then there is a drain on the system, and you are liable to have hectic fever occurring. It has not been recog- nised until comparatively lately that it is in all probability a state of blood-poisoningâ€”really a chronic septicaemia; and the great point is to get rid of any septic element, and so improve the patient's condition. Let the theory be what it may, the practice is undoubted. The first thing is to get rid of the cause, and there- fore it is that you amputate a diseased joint in such a case as this. But unfortunately in this patient the joint is not the only source of irritation, the lungs are affected as well, and they are an additional centre of mischief. But still I think I am justified in having amputated this patient's thigh. Can you do anything more for these patients ?

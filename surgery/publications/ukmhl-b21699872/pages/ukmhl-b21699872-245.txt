ON ANEURYSM 229 Broca, the great French surgeon and patho- logist, whose work on Aneurysm is quite a classic, very strongly laid down that. there were two forms of clot, namely, active clot, as he called it, by which he meant laminated clot, which is more or less colourless and firm; and again the passive clot, as he termed it, which is the ordinary clot due to coagulation of the contents of the sac, and which, of course, is coloured, and is found, after death, to be black. He maintained very strongly that the cure of the aneurysm depended solely upon the active clot, and that the passive clot was rather a hindrance than otherwise. Now, another view held about that is, that the passive clot is converted into what is termed the active clot, and I myself have very httle doubt about it. Richet, probably, was the author who most strongly insisted upon that. I think the evidence is very strong in its favour, and that really there is no great difference between the two clots except in the matter of time, and that any clot which is deposited upon the coat of the artery, will in process of time, become colourless and more or less laminated, and will very effectually strengthen the coat of the aneurysm by being piled up layer upon layer, just at the weakest point. It IS as though nature attempted to reheve the weakness of the coat at that side by

70 ON STRICTURE OF THE RECTUM Other muscles, thus making some sort of sphincter for tlie bowel afterwards. Having got through the three muscles, I shall come upon the fascia transversahs and the peritoneum, both of which have to be opened. This brings one, without the slightest difficulty, upon the sigmoid flexure, easily recognisable by the mus- cular longitudinal bands, which are unmistak- able. If the sigmoid flexure is not actually in view, the small intestine has to be pushed aside and the flexure sought for. It is necessary to make sure that you are above the seat of the disease. It is not in every case that the disease can be felt from the rectum, and occasionally colotomy has to be performed without feeling anything. It has happened to me to have opened the left side, found that I was not above the disease ; then to have stitched up the wound and opened the colon on the other side, the patient making a good recovery. The colon is pulled up and brought out of the wound, and I am then in the habit of using a glass rod pushed through the meso-colon, to support the bowel in its place. Some surgeons do not use this, and I do not insist upon it; but I do insist on the necessity for stitching the colon, although I know some surgeons say it is quite unnecessary, and that if the parts are merely left in apposition they will unite. But you must remember that you have got the

There was a dentist named Morton, who lived in Boston, and he had made experiments with nitrous oxide gas, Avhich, as had been known before, from the time of Sir Humphry Davy, produced a certain amount of excite- ment, and hence was called " laughmg gas," but if pushed beyond that jDroduced a temporary anaisthesia. Morton employed this in extract- ing teeth, and then he bethought him that he might possibly find something which would be a little more potent and more manageable. This he found in sulphuric ether, and then, having been successful in a good many cases of tooth extraction under the influence of ether, he spoke to Warren of Boston, and asked if he might have the opportunity to give ether for some patient upon whom he was to operate.

136 ON A CASE OF FRACTURE OF meatus to the point where the auditory and facial nerves separate. The fracture in the temporal bone passes through the petrous portion of the bone across the tympanum, and tears through that little process of arachnoid upon the nerve. The fluid therefore gravitates from the subarachnoid space into the tympanum, and finds its Avay out of that cavity, and in the particular case before us to-day it was down the Eustachian tube; but as the mem- brana tympani is generally torn through, it usually comes out of the ear. The pillow is noticed to be wet with the watery fluid, which is recognised at once as the cerebro-spinal fluid. Until quite recently we were content to let that cerebro-spinal fluid run away, perhaps examining it sometimes to see that it really was cerebro-spinal fluid, but nothing was done to these cases and patients were allowed to continue to die from septic meningitis. How- ever, at last it was suggested by some one that if the external auditory meatus were cleansed, and if it were plugged with an antiseptic dress- ing to prevent septic material being introduced into the meninges, it would probably be a great advantage. Accordingly, nowadays, cotton wool is dipped into carboHc acid lotion and wrapped round a probe, and with it we wipe out the external auditory meatus. I advise you to do it with a probe and not with^ a syringe, because by syringing you might drive

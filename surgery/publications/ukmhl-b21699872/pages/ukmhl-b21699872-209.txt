And I think the proof that it is so is the fact that I cure my cases rapidly by giving them large doses of quinine. Of course you may say, Well, that would do equally well for a nervous complamt." So it might, but it certainly is a tact that if you give these cases of gonorrhoeal rneumatism, so-called, 5-grain doses of quinine N

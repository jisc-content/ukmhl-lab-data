The drawback to excision in children, of course, was that the bones were so much in- terfered with, particularly the epiphyses, that the limbs never grew as they should do after- wards, and there are many cases on record of patients, who had joints excised as children, who grew up with little stunted limbs, which were practically of no use to them. That is not the case when arthrectomy is performed. Arthrectomy does not mterfere with the growth of the bone, but it attacks and removes the local disease, and if the patient gets over the immediate operation, he recovers with a very useful joint—in some cases with a movable joint; but that, of course, depends a good deal upon how much disease there was at the time of the operation. But do not let me be supposed to say that every case of tubercular disease of the joint requires even that operation. I am quite sure of this: that with due care, and with attention to the general health, and with patience— because that is a great element in these cases —we can cure a great many cases which at

I20 ON A CASE OF GANGRENE OF THE LEG would give way, and there would be a groove of ulceration between the living and the dead tissues. It must be that this occurs at the expense of the living tissues, and you have thus a line of ulceration that may be very properly called the line of separation, which is an undoubted line, and it takes place between the living and the dead. This ulceration extends down to the bone, the tissues become somewhat retracted, and eventually the bone is exposed. Shall you Avait for that line of separation or shall you amputate early ? Now there is a good deal of difference of opinion on this matter, and, for my part, if I have a case of bond fide dry gangrene from embolism or senile gangrene, and certainly in frostbite, I should Avait for the line of separation to take place, and for the bone to be exposed ; and I should then put on retractors, and saw through the bone as high as I could, and I believe, in that Avay, Avould be doing my best for my patient.

The actually gangrenous part Avill be of a mottled purple colour, and above it there will be the process of moist gangrene going on. In these cases you must not Avait for the line of separation; if you do, the chances are that

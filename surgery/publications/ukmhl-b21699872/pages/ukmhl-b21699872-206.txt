IQO ON DISEASES OF THE JOINTS may liope that the danger of inflammation is passed. But supposing that we do not see the case so early, or at all events, that synovitis occurs: there would be all the local symptoms of in- flammation—pain and heat—and the swelling, which is due, of course, to the effusion of synovial fluid. Now I take it that we are more familiar, most of us, with the distension of a joint in the chronic condition; but it makes no difference, of course, whether it is acute or chronic, there is the distended knee- joint, the patella floats and you can press it back, and rap it against the condyles, if you like, and if the tension of the joint is not too great. If the tension is very great you may not be able to do that, but there are the syno- vial pouches well distended with fluid. I feel sure that this distension is one of the great elements in sending a patient's temperature up. The temperature will range from 102° to 104° F., and the patient will be very ill. I think that experiments have shown quite con- clusively that the mere presence of fluid producing tension is alone sufiicient to raise the temperature, and therefore obviously the indication is to reduce that tension as soon as possible. Now there is no method better and no method simpler, or more safe, than to aspirate

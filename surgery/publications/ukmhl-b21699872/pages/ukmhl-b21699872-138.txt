122 ON A CASE OF GANGRENE OF THE LE(! from my own practice some years ago as an illustration. A nurse, aged thirty-four, pricked her finger in laying out the body of a lady who had died of puerperal peritonitis. A few hours after the finger became swollen and painful, when she rubbed the spot with nitrate of silver and appHed a poultice. The finger became more swollen, and the redness extended above the elbow, and she was very restless. On the fourth day I saw her, and found the whole arm swollen and red from her fingers to the upper third of the arm ; two fingers were numb, and purple discoloration was beginning on the hand. I made free incisions into the hand, forearm, and arm, and nothing but bloody serum escaped. On the fifth day the hand and fingers were of a blue colour, there were bulke about the limb, and the arm was more swollen. On the sixth day the condition had improved, and it was hoped that the gangrene might be confined to the forearm. In the afternoon, however, the patient became worse, and the inflammatory blush began to spread rapidly. I therefore amputated at once at the shoulder-joint, and the patient completely recovered. In these terrible cases of spreading traumatic gangrene the only safe rule is to amputate early and high.

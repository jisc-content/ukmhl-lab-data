TUBERCULAR JOINT-DISEASE IO9 necessarily add somewliat to the risk of tlie patient.

We washed out the wound with carbolic and dressed it with an ordinary cyanide dressing, and it was dressed first on the Friday and again to-day. In a case of this kind it is important to provide thorough drainage, and you will remember that at the time of the operation I put a fair-sized drainage tube right across, with a safety pin at each end to secure it. At the first dressing we cut off half of that drainage-tube, and inserted it on the outer side, and next time we shall leave off the tube altogether.

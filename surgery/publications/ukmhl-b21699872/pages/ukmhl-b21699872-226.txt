2IO ON DISEASES OF THE JOINTS bone, and a discharge of pus going on for weeks or months together, you are apt to find that you have a very large hver, and that you have urine containing a large quantity of albumen ; and on post-mortem examination of such a case you will find a large lardaceous liver, and also lardaceous kidneys. In those cases the only possible chance—and it is but a poor one—is to amputate the limb. But again, I have seen most remarkable results sometimes from an amputation done so as to get rid of the source of the mischief, and then sending the patient down to the seaside. They sometimes make almost miraculous recoveries. Of late years attention has been called to the fact that there is a disease of the joints which is probably syphihtic. I do not know, why the joints should be the only part which would escape the effects of syphihtic poison. We know how the bones are affected with syphihs. It is not at all surprising that the joints should be affected, too, but it is a fact that attention has only of late been called to it, and there have not been very many cases reported of the disease. I have here a plate which illustrates, rather well, some cases re- corded by Mr. Bowlby, of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and I will pass it around. You may see that there have been gummatous deposits, or what appear to be gummatous deposits.

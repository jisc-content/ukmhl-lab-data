2 56 ■ ON ANEURYSM Before leaving the subject, let me say tliat only within tlie last few weeks, just before I left England, I received a very remarkable paper by Professor Murphy, of Chicago. Pro- fessor Murphy, whose name you all know in connection with the button which is used for intestinal anastomosis, has shown in this paper something quite new, which will have a very important bearing upon the treatment of aneurysm. He has shown that if you choose to cut a piece out of an artery—absolutely to cut, say an inch or an inch and a half out of an artery—if you then put one end of the artery into the other end and stitch them together they will unite. So far as I know that is an entirely new fact in pathology, which has never even been sug- gested before. Professor Murphy not merely shows this by experiments upon lower animals, but he records a case of pistol wound of the femoral artery, where he cut out the piece of the artery through which the bullet had gone; and then, bringing the two ends to- gether, he inserted one into the other and stitched them together and they united, the patient making a perfect recovery. I need hardly point out how very materially that may and will, in all probability, modify our treat- ment, because, if we can cut out small aneurysms and bring the arteries together, it of course will

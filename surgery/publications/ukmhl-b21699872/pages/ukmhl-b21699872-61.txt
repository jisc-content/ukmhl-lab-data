In the female there is no doubt fissure does sometimes occur in parturition, the woman has a bad labour, and the effect of the stretching of the parts for the passage of the child's head is to leave her with a fissure.

If the fissure has only just occurred, it will very often get well under the treatment I spoke of in connec- tion with internal pilesâ€”belladonna or atropia ointment and keeping the bowels relaxed. But if the fissure occurred a week or two before the case is seen, that treatment is inadequate, and by far the best method in such cases is to dilate the sphincter. I know it is painful for the moment, but the relief subsequently afforded to the patient atones for the pain of dilatation, and in the majority of cases it is not necessary to administer an anaesthetic, though in a nervous woman this should be done. But there are cases of extensive fissure, where it may be necessary to divide the sphincter partially with the knife, and for that you should lay the patient up and give him an anaesthetic. In an old-standing cas#, in which there is much induration, it may be better to pass a finger into the bowel and guide upon that a bistoury, withdrawing the finger and knife together. The result is th^xt the knife cuts into the

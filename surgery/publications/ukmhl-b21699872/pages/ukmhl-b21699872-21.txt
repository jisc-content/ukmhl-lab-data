ON ULCERS OF THE LEG 5' Stimulant ointment; and, of course, it has a certain popularity. But there are plenty of oint- ments in the Pharmacopeia which are quite as good or even better. If you want a stimulating ointment for an ulcer, I do not know that you can do better than use some mild form of mercurial ointment. The Nitrate of Mercury ointment of the Pharmacopoeia, well diluted, is extremely useful. The Nitric Oxide or Red Mercurial ointment is a great favourite with prescribing chemists, but in my experience is a great deal too stimulating. You find that patients complain that it burns them, and it certainly does not do their legs good. Then, of course, there are numerous lotions. The ordinary red lotion of the hospital, which con- sists mainly of Sulphate of Zinc and Tincture of Lavender, is an exceedingly useful applica- tion. It has been used in the case of the patient now before you; and you may see that it is worth while in applying it to take a little trouble to do it properly. You may have heard me, going round the ward, tell the dresser to cut a pattern of the size of the ulcer on paper, then to cut his lint exactly of the same size and shape, and, having soaked the lint in the red lotion, to apply it to the surface of the ulcer, and over that and beyond it to put a piece of lint simply dipped in water, over which again a waterproof material is placed.

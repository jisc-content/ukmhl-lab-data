Here again irrigation is one of the best methods of treatment; but, if the slough- mg is really extensive, one has to take rather more prompt measures; and I know of no methpd better fitted to check a sloughing ulcer than the application of the strongest Nitric Acid. But then you must do it properly. You must, in the first place, dry the surface of the ulcer, and then into the edges of it with a piece of wood—there is nothing better—you should rub the fuming Nitric Acid thoroughly, not merely into the sloughing surface but a little into the skin beyond. Then you will find that under a poultice a slough will come away; and in all probability you will have checked the unhealthy action. We see, of course, ulcers of very important parts, such as the penis, where a considerable ulceration will lead to destruction of important structures. Now, you can certainly check the sloughing chancre by the application of Nitric Acid, if it is thoroughly done in the way I have described. Then again you must be prepared to find from time to time ulcers taking on an un-

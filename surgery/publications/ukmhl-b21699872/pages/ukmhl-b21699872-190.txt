174 ON THE DISTAL LIGATURE IN THE There were two aneurysmal sacs, a large one springing from the ascending aorta,and a smaller one arising from the back of the innomi- nate artery. Both contained laminated clot. The aortic aneurysm formed a tumour as large as a clenched male fist, lying to the right of the extra-pericardial ascending aorta, and communicating with its lumen by an orifice the size of a florin. This pierced the antero- external wall of the vessel about midway between the pericardium and the origin of the innominate. The fibrous tissue forming the wall of the aneurysm extended around the vena cava and the origin of the imiominate, and to the jugular vein. The manubrium sterni and ribs are adherent to the sac. On opening the aneurysmal sac it was found to be filled with clot, the central part soft and rather fluid, the main mass distinctly laminated. The most peripheral portion was decolorised. The innominate aneurysm formed a tumour as large as a hen's egg, arising from the artery a quarter of an inch from its bifurcation. It lay behind and to the left of the larger aneurysm, to which it adhered, being in close contact with, and adherent to, the trachea on the inner side. It contained laminated clot, and communicated with the larger sac by its lower end. The left carotid was obliterated an inch below

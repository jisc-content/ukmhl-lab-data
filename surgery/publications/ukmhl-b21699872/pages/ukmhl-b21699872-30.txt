14 ON ULCERS OF THE LEG which you have also seen in the wards, and it consists in paring from a healthy surface with a razor a large piece of cuticle, and then implanting that upon the surface of the ulcer, which has been previously thoroughly scraped to get rid of all the granulations existing upon it. You will see, then, the difference between the two methods. In Reverdin's method merely grafts are implanted upon the granulations, which are presumed to be healthy; in Thiersch's method the granulations are removed with a sharp spoon, and then the large sheet of cuticle is placed over the ulcer, in both cases strict antiseptic dressing being employed. Both methods have their advantages, and may be used in appropriate cases. There is just a third method, called Wolfe's method, which you have seen me try lately in a case of destruction of the nose. It consists in removing the whole thickness of skin and implanting it upon the healthy granulating surface of another part of the body. In my own case, I am sorry to say, the result was not satisfactory: but still it is a method which might be employed with advantage where portions of the skin have been lost and require replacement.

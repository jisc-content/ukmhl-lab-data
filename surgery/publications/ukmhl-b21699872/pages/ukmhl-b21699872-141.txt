THE BASE OF THE SKULL 125 was passed easily, and 14 ozs. of urine were drawn off. The urine was pale and acid; with a cloud of albumen. Knee-jerks were still absent. An enema simplex was given, but was. returned without result. From about 10.30 the patient's temperature gradually rose until 1 o'clock, to 9 9"2Â°. The pulse became more rapid and fe'eble, 120, respirations became shallower, several times the bleeding increased and necessitated sponging of the pharynx. At 2.30 P.M., or about twelve hours after . the injury, the patient died from failure of respiration; the radial pulse could not be 'felt. Heart-beats continued for three minutes after cessation pi respiration. At the autopsy, on reflecting the scalp th-ere was extravasation of blood beneath the temporal fascia on each side, but none under the scalp, and no fracture was seen. On re- moving the roof of the skull, the dura mater was' found to be unusually adherent; on the right side it was somewhat separated from the middle fossa, and there was extravasation of blood outside it of small size. On reflecting the dura mater, both temporo-sphenoidal lobes were covered by large masses of clot, the amount being larger on the right side. On the brain being removed, there was found a laceration of the dura in the right middle fossa

154 ON CASES OF EPITHELIOMA indeed the appearance tliat we call leucoplalda. The man's tongue ulcerated, and he went back to the skin department. On hearing that he had had syphilis they naturally put him on iodide of potassium. By the time he came to me it was a well-marked case of epithelioma, and I removed it by the same method I adopted in the other cases. There was no enlarged gland, and I beUeve, therefore, that he may have a long period of immunity; I should be sorry to say that he will be permanently relieved, though I was well beyond the disease. The microscope showed that it was an epithe- lioma. The last case that I will mention is one of epitheHoma of the penis. It is not very common, but occurs from time to time, and generally in elderly men who have had phimosis. It is undoubted that phimosis seems to be a starting cause of epithelioma of the penis. Youjcan easily understand that, if the foreskm is never drawn back, the smegma preputii becomes rancid and irritating, and sets up ulceration which may eventually become epitheliomatous. That is one great argument for early circumcision. The disease does not occur generally early in Hfe ; the foreskin being long may lead to other troubles, but epithelioma does not as a rule begin till after fifty. There is an intractable ulceration about the penis.

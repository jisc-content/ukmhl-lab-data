ON ANEURYSM 242 it would be very much better to do the two operations at the same time. I therefore, in 1865, applied a ligature first to the subclavian artery, simply taking that first because I thought it was the more difficult operation; and then, having closed that wound, I immedi- ately applied a ligature to the carotid artery above the omohyoid muscle. That patient recovered perfectly; and I would just remmd you that it was in 1865, long before the days of aseptic surgery, and, therefore, I used an ordinary hemp ligature, and left the ends of the ligatures hanging out, and the wounds suppurated ; but everything did perfectly well, and the patient was immensely relieved. I need not go into the symptoms, but the aneurysm shrank, the tumour in the neck materially decreased, and the patient eventually left the hospital. She was, unfortunately, a woman of very dis- sipated habits, and I found that she was con- stantly getting inebriated, but I was determined that, come what might,I would have the prepara- tion some day. Accordingly,! had a label written and fixed on her clothes, saying that wherever this patient was found by the poHce, informa- tion was to be sent to me at my house ; and every now and then there was a knock at the door, and a policeman called to say that a woman named Julia White had been taken up.

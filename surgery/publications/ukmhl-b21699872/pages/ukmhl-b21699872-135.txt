What I wanted to show you was this, that above the part which is actually gangrenous there is a more or less developed inflammatory blush, which is part of the process of gangrene. There is inflammation first, which is shown by the ordinary symptoms of redness, heat, and pain, and then the gangrene is developed at the extremity, and the blush gradually creeps up the foot. In a case like this we look for this inflammation, and it is commonly said that there is a line of demarcation, which I think students get rather a wrong impression about. On looking at the limb you see the gangrenous part and the blush continuous with it, and there is a line where the two join; but it is wrong to call it a line of demarcation, which it is not, and the only thing is to watch and see if the gangrene is extending.

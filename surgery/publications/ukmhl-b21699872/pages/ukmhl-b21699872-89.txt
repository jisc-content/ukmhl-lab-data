ON STRICTURE OF THE RECTUM 73 in finding the bowel, a very curious thing sometimes happens, viz., the bowel gets twisted, and when you come to open it you find that, instead of fseces coming out at the upper open- ing, they emerge at the lower one. I have heard of that a good many times, but have only once met with it myself. Why it should be so I cannot tell. The patient we have been dis- cussing looks as if she will do well. Of course, the operation I am going to do will in no way cure her rectum, but it will remove the source of constant irritation from fseces, and will entirely obviate any possibility of her becoming- obstructed, and it will therefore prolong her hfe. In these cases the patients may go on very comfortably for two, or even three years, which is the average duration of life after colotomy; whereas, if the operation were not performed, she could not live more than three or four months, so that there can be no doubt about the propriety of operating in her case.

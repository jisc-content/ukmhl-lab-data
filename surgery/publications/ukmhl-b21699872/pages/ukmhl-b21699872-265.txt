ON ANEURYSM 249 distinguished themselves in carrying this out, and there is no doubt that if pressure is judiciously adapted between the heart and the aneurysm, there will be slowing down of the current of blood, a deposit of fibrin, and probably a cure. That pressure may either be digital, with the fingers of assistants, or instrumental, by means of certain screw apparatuses, which are adapted for the purpose. For my own part, I think digital pressure is by far the more satis- factory, and what we aim at is this: We have a relay of assistants, who keep up pressure upon the femoral artery for a certain number of hours, so as to allow no blood whatever to pass through it. If we stagnate the blood in an aneurysm, that blood will probably coagu- late, and that is what we are aiming at; and with careful assistants, relieving each other every ten minutes, I have been able to carry out that treatment in certain cases very satis- factorily. The great thing is to have a tract- able patient, and to get him to take an interest in his own case, because he will have to submit to a certain amount of inconvenience; and then to have good assistants, who will reheve each other every ten minutes, and keep up pressure with their thumbs, the hand em- bracmg the limb, and the thumbs coming upon the artery, one over the other. In that

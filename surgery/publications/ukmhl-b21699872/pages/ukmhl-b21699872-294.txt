2/8 A CENTURY OF SURGERY the flesh of my thigh it was exactly as if I Avas burned as severely as possible." One can easily understand that that does represent very fairly the feeling which would be induced by the transfixion of the living tissues of the limb by a long knife carried rapidly through it. The flap method having been introduced by Liston, it was found by him and by other surgeons that by adapting it to various parts of the body, it was possible to give a better stump, and to make a longer one than by the circular method. But it was also found that the fleshy flaps were sometimes very inconvenient, and hence when ana3Sthetics came in, and the necessity for rapid operating passed away, surgeons found that it was possible to make better stumps by other methods than transfixion of the limb. Fore- most amongst those innovators must be mentioned the late Mr. Teale, of Leeds, who early in the Fifties introduced rectangular flaps cut from without inwards, and including the whole of the tissues. Mr. Teale gave strict measurements for his flaps; thus the anterior flap was to measure half the circumference of the limb at the point of section both in length and breadth, and the posterior flap was to be a quarter of this in length. Naturally, with such unequal flaps the anterior was folded over the end of the bone, and the cicatrix

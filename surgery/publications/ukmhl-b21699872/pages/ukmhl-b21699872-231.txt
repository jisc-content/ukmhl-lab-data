ON DISEASES OF THE JOINTS 2 I 5 there really is a little loose body which moves about in the interior of the joint, and which you can find, on careful manipulation, by the side of the patella from time to time; but the moment you touch it it disappears into the interior of the joint, and perhaps you may not find it again for some days. These little bodies are very curious, and it is remarkable that John Hunter, in his paper, acute observer as he was, lays it down that these loose carti- lages were the result of organisation of blood- clot. You know John Hunter had rather an exaggerated opuiion of the blood, and he had a notion—there was no evidence to prove it but it was a conclusion he came to—that those httle bodies must be the result of a small clot Avhich happened to have occurred in the joint, and which became organised. In the first place, it is impossible that blood clot can organise into cartilage, and in the next place, there is a very much more feasible ex- planation in the little fringes which you all must have seen in the knee-joint. In certain cases these become very much hypertrophied, and then no doubt one of them becomes more or less developed into a httle body containing cartilage, and eventually the pedicle breaks, and it gets loose in the interior of the joint.' You may, by opening the joint, find quite a number of these fringes in various stages of

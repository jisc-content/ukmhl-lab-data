Let us consider what are the characters of the disease called epithelial cancer. At first, owing, in the majority of cases, to some local irritation, there is an over-development of the cell element, which tends to form columns and grow do-\vnwards; and then we have a certain amount of induration, and eventually we have ulceration, with the characteristic eversion of the edges, which we see so commonly in all the cases of epithelioma. In addition to that, and at varying periods, we have the gland impHcation; in some cases the glands become involved very early, in others comparatively late, and it is curious that the position of the cancer seems to affect this a good deal. In the lip, as a rule, it is a disease of old age and chronic growth, slowly affectmg the glands. In the tongue, which is a much more vascular part, it is a disease of middle life and even of young subjects, and the glands are rapidly affectedâ€”so much so, that it makes one almost despair of success in operating.

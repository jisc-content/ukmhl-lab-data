ON ANEURYSM 223 In the calcareous change of the artery we have a development of calcareous nodules, or particles, in the muscular fibre of the vessel, and I need hardly say that this muscular fibre is more developed in the smaller than in the large arteries. Hence we have calcareous degeneration commonly in the smaller arteries, but atheroma affects the larger arteries, and especially the aorta. There is hardly an old subject in which we do not find more or less evidence of patches of atheroma in one or more parts of the aorta. In the latter stages there is apt to be a development of bone, or something allied to bone, in the atheromatous artery, quite different from the calcareous degeneration which takes place in the smaller vessels. Given a diseased artery, it is not very surprising that we should find aneurysm occur- ring under certain morbid conditions of the body. I think there can be no doubt that syphiHs is a very important element, and has a direct bearing upon the formation of aneurysm. In England we find that soldiers are especially liable to aneurysm, and much more so than sailors. Now, I take it that both classes of men are equally liable to syphilis. They arc also equally Hable to sudden and violent muscular efforts, and I look upon those efforts as being one of the main causes

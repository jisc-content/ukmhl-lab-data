2 8o A CENTURY OF SURGERY longer, or when their strength was giving way as a last resource the surgeon recommended and performed amputation. But when anaesthesia came m, m the year 1846, the whole thing was altered. Surgeons found then that they had time during the anaesthesia to deal with joints in a very different way from what they had done previously, and it was then, owing to the efforts of Syme and Liston, and Fergusson particularly, that the operation which we call resection came in. By resection Ave mean that instead of cutting oft' a limb where there was disease, the joint was opened, the diseased ends of the bone were removed, and the fresh- cut ends, being brought together, united, and the patient recovered with a straight, stiff, and someAvhat shortened limb. Then again, of late years, upon that even an improvement has been made, and we now have the method of " arthrectomy."

320 THE HUNTERIAN ORATION page in his works doubled down, in order that I may read out an authoritative statement to those miserable persons who consult the surgeon from time to time for so-called " spermatorrhoea"â€”a word which one could wish eliminated from our language. It is remarkable that the term " Hunterian chancre" should have been the universally accepted description of the primary syphilitic sore, for Hunter himself says: "Venereal ulcers have one character, which, however, is not entirely peculiar to them, for many sores that have no disposition to heal (which is the case with a chancre) have so far the same character. A chancre has commonly a thickened base ; and although in some the common inflammation spreads much further, yet the specific is con- fined to this base." But what is most remark- able is that Hunter denied the existence of chancres on the mucous membrane of the vagina or cervix uteri, and a fortiori did not recognise such unusual occurrences as chancre of the lip, &c. Although the anatomy and pathology of the lymphatic system, including glandular enlargements, had made great pro- gress during the previous century, yet the primary indolent bubo was not recognised as typical of syphilitic infection. Thus we find Hunter describing all kinds of buboes as occurring during the primary stage of syphilis.

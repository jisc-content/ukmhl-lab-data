94 ON MENINGOCELE AND ENCEPHALOCELE white and grey substance was perfectly evident. The occipital encephalocele is by far the commonest of the varieties which are met with, but the most important, surgically, are those of the anterior part of the head, and particularly at the root of the nose. The late Mr. Zachariah Laurence published a paper some years ago, in which he showed that in seventy-five cases of encephalocele re- ported up to 1856, fifty-three occurrred in the occipital region, seventeen in the frontal region, and five in the parietal and temporal regions. In that year I brought before the Patho- logical Society of London four examples of encephalocele in the anterior part of the skull. In the first case (Fig. 7) the tumour was of large size, involving the orbit and : forehead. The right half of the frontal bone, \ the whole of the parietal and portions of the temporal bone were wanting, and no traces of < the eyeball existed. The tumour was com- j posed of softened brain-substance, and was i supported by the squamous portion of the i, temporal bone, which was pushed forwards j and outwards, at right angles to the malar f bone. Over the cribriform portion of the f ethmoid was a large cyst, filled with yellow \ transparent fluid. There was a hare-lip and t cleft palate. The child lived four days. [

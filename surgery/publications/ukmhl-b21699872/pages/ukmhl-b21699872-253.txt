ON ANEURYSM If the ligature of the main artery does not stop the circulation, there is one of two things: either it is not an aneurysm, or you have tied the wrong artery. There is a case on record, and the preparation is in University College Museum, where Sir Charles Bell cut down upon the femoral artery for popliteal aneurysm and tied it, and did not stop the pulsation. After a consultation with his colleagues at the Middlesex Hospital, for that was where it occurred, he amputated the thigh ; and then on dissection found that it was one of those curious examples of a double femoral artery, and that he had happened to tie the one on which the aneurysm did not exist. I don't know of any other example of the same kind, but it is important to bear in mind that such a thing may occur, and, of course, if it did, the surgeon would look for the other artery, and certainly not amputate the limb. I presume, then, that the main artery in connection with the aneurysm is tied, and the pulsation immediately ceases, and the aneurysm becomes less tense. The temperature of the Kmb also falls somewhat, and the Hmb becomes a Httle paler, and we put the patient to bed, and wrap the Hmb up in cotton wool and flannel, so as to keep the temperature equable. We watch our patient, and we find, in all

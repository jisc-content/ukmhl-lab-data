222 ON ANEURYSM which the coats of the artery have given way, the wall of the sac being formed by the surrounding tissues, more or less indurated and matted together, as they always are, by the changes Avhich take place during the formation of the aneurysm. Then, also, there is that rarer form which we call the dissecting aneurysm, where the blood forces its way between the coats of the artery, runs for a certain distance along the vessel, and then again forms an opening, and the blood finds its way into the main artery. This is very rare, being generally found only in the aorta. Aneurysm may be named from the cause, and may be idiopathic or traumatic. Idio- pathic aneurysm is by far the most common, and I take it that the great cause of aneurysm is the occurrence of atheroma in the coats of the artery. Atheroma used to be considered as merely a form of fatty degeneration of the tissues, but of late years a good deal of light has been thrown upon the subject, and we know now that atheroma consists essentially in an inflammatory process, the development of a small cell infiltration of the coats of the artery; and that it is only in the later stages that that infiltration undergoes fatty degenera- tion, with which we are all familiar at post- mortem examinations of old diseased arteries.

262 ON SYPHILITIC DISEASES altered, and more commonly the bald patch is found, which is so significant of secondary syphilis of the mucous membrane of the tongue and mouth. The patient may have gone through the first stage without its having been recognised, and as a result of that shedding of the epithelium there is a certain amount of cicatricial tissue causing smoothness of the sur- face of the tongue, recognised as the character- istic " bald patch." We may have another condition following thatâ€”namely, inflammation going on to ulcera- tion, and this may show itself in various ways. It generally is a multiple ulceration, making- grooves in the side of the tongue, not afl'ecting very nuich the dorsum, but involving fairly deeply the sides and tip of the organ. I send round an illustration, and in Fig. 1 of this plate you will see fissuring of the tongue and some hypertrophy of its tissue. Here is a better illustration, which shows exceedingly well the appearance after the ulceration has healed, and we have there a certain amount of thickening; you will notice also the sulci or grooves which have been cut into the tongue by the process of ulceration. That process may, of course, extend a good deal into the tissue of the tongue, and you occasionally find, as is shown here, a true glossitis or inflamma- tion of the tongue due to the syphilitic poison.

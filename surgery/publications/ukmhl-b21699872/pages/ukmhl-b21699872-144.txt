The injury was produced. in this case by direct violence. When a man falls from a scafiblding and pitches down upon his head, the vertex coming first against the pavement, the whole weight of the body of a heavy man, falling thirty or forty feet, comes upon the basilar process of the occipital bone and breaks it through, and that is one way in Avhich fracture of the skull occurs.

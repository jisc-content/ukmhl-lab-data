ON ANEURYSM 253 below by lymph, the ligature coming away by ulcerating through the small remaining por- tion of the external coat tied in the loop. No one has ever improved upon that, I think, until Lister introduced what we call now the aseptic ligatureâ€”I mean the catgut Hgature. There had been various attempts, and Sir Astley Cooper and other surgeons had tried to use an absorbable ligature, but they all failed, because the ligatures became more or less putrid and offensive. Lister showed us that, by using properly prepared catgut, it would be possible to tie an artery successfully, and, as I mentioned just now, I used catgut in my first case of left carotid ligature. The success which has followed the use of catgut is very remarkable, but still there have been a few failures. I had myself a case where I tied the femoral artery with a catgut ligature, and two days afterwards it was found that the artery was beating as freely as ever and the aneurysm too, and it was quite clear, there- fore, that the catgut had given way rather too early. I put on a silk ligature a little lower down, in Hunter's canal, and the patient got perfectly well. My friend. Sir Thomas Smith, surgeon to St. Bartholomew's Hos- pital, was a little less fortunate. He tied an artery in the same way with catgut, which gave way, but, unfortunately, the artery became

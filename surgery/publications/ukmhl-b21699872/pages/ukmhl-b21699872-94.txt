In a mild case like this, I trust mainly to the rigidity of the abdominal muscles for my diagnosis. The recti abdominis appear to be the muscles which are very early alfected with this spastic contraction, and they remain in that condition till the patient either recovers or dies. You have all had an oppor- tunity of feeling this patient's abdomen, and you will have noticed that there is still rigidity present. With the rigidity there is apt to be retention of urine, for emptying of the bladder depends to a certain extent on the action of the abdominal muscles, and, therefore, in cases of acute tetanus, the bladder should always be emptied from time to time.

There are three conditions which it is con- venient to contrast with one another: tetanus, hydrophobia, and the results of the administra- tion of strychnia. In tetanus there is no inter- mission, there is no thirst, and the mind is clear,

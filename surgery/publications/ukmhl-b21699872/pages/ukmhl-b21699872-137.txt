ON A CASE OF GANGRENE OF THE LEG 121 the patient will be poisoned by his OAvn secretions, that he will get pyoamia or septicaemia from some form of infection, and that he will die. Therefore in these cases one advises an amputation in the middle of the leg when the gangrene is only in the foot, because by that means you amputate in healthy tissue, and you hope to restore the patient with a short but useful limb. The same thing applies also to that curious form of gangrene which has been recognised only comparatively recently, that is the gangrene occurring in diabetic patients. In a patient who has gangrene, and you can find no ordinary cause, you should always examine the urine ; it is a gangrene distinctly connected with sugar in the urine, and is what is called moist gangrene ; the only chance in these cases seems to be to do an amputation high up, at or above the knee if necessary. Mr, Godlee has paid a great deal of attention to this disease, and I think that that is the conclusion he has come to; I have seen him amputate in many cases high up, with the result of saving the patient's life, and that is the main point after all. But supposing we had the rapidly spreading form of traumatic gangrene due to some septic poison, then there is no question about early amputation. Let me relate to you an instance

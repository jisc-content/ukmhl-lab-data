Then there is another disease which we see a great deal of in London, and that is rheuma- toid arthritis. I mean that you have patients, and generally middle-aged and badly nourished patients, who have more or less thickening of the joints, which sometimes goes on to very great deformity of the fingers and toes. It is, no doubt, a disease of bad nutrition. There is a certain amount of deposit in the cartilages of the articulations, and as the cases go on we find that the joints become more or less creaky â€”they creak as the patient moves.

If it has, time will be saved by laying open the bowel, and if this be not done, a fistula will certainly result. In many cases the bowel does not require to be laid open, but if I find the abscess goes some little distance up the side of the rectum, I feel sure it will eventually burst through, and it saves time to lay the whole thing open at once.

ON ANEUKYSM 233 thorax, and, as I shall pomt out to you later on, with some considerable success, by means of what is called the distal ligature. Probably the earliest operation with regard to aneurysm of the limbs was that commonly known by the name of Antyllus. The sac of the aneurysm was incised, whatever clot was there was turned out, and then the upper and lower ends of the artery were secured by a hgature. I need hardly point out what a serious proceeding that was, particularly in the days when the mode of arresting hsemor- rhage by pressure above the aneurysm was not^ well understood. The result may be anticipated. These patients very generally died of haemorrhage, either at the time of the operation or a few days afterwards, when the ligatures, which were roughly put upon the artery, came away. The operation, therefore, fell into a good deal of disrepute ; so much so that Pott,"" the great surgeon of St. Bartholomew's at the' end of the last century—the surgeon who first described what we commonly know as Pott's disease, and who also wrote about Pott's fracture of the fibula—says in his works that the treatment of aneurysm is so unsatis- factory that, for his own part, he thinks the only plan is to amputate the thigh in all cases of pophtoal aneurysm.

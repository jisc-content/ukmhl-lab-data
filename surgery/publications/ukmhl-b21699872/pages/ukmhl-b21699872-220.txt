204 ON DISEASES OF THE JOINTS deal to advance such surgery, and Fergusson was tlie man who followed it up in London, and who forced it upon his colleagues. I can remember as a young student the very strong- feeling there was among the older surgeons of the more conservative hospitals against ex- cision. They said that Fergusson killed most of his patients, and there was an element of truth in that, which I will explain presently. No doubt a good many cases died that ought not to have died, but still the operation made progress, and as the older surgeons fell away from the hospitals and were succeeded by younger men, excision was taken up, and in some cases, I think, carried out to a very great excess. I do not want to mention names, but there are one or two surgeons in London who, at one time, were in the habit of excising—I mean absolutely excising—in children for very slight tubercular disease of the joint. That just shows how the swing of the pendulum goes. But we have improved very materially upon that, for no one would think of excising a joint now when a very much less severe opera- tion could be carried out; and that operation is what is called arthrectomy.

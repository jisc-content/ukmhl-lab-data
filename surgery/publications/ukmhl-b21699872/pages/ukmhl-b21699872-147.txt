Bleeding may be from the middle menmgeal artery, but the effusion in that case is outside the meninges, and the blood accumulates and forms a clot producing well-marked symptoms of paralysis. But in this case the meningeal artery was not torn aiid the hemorrhage came from the brain for there was was no doubt that there was some laceration of the brain substance here which would naturally occur in such a violent iniury.

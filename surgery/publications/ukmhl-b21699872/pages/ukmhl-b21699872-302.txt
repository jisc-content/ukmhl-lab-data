A CENTURY OF SURGERY 286 having settled down in Scotland as it Avere, was appointed Regius Professor of Surgery at Glasgow; and it was in the old Glasgow Infirmary, a building which was in many respects most insanitary, that Lister was in- duced first to try whether something could not be done to improve the condition of his un- fortunate patients. He found that, do what he Avould, all his wounds suppurated, and the great majority of his patients died from infection of the system from the wounds; and he happened, more by accident I think than anything else, to employ carbolic acid. Carbolic acid, about that time, was coming into note as an ordinary antiseptic. It was used to throw down drains and to take away offensive smells, and so on, and he used it, and one of his earliest experiments was to take a case of compound fracture and to dress it with carbolic acid, and see what happened. What hajopened was that, to his very great surprise—and I am told by those who were present at the time and saw it, that Lister himself was perfectly astonished—when he came to open the compound fracture, instead of suppuration there was a clot organising in the wound, there was no inflammation, the part was quiet, and it was healing under the in- fluence of what at first sight would appear to be a great irritant.

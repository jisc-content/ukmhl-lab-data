254 ON ANEURYSM weakened at the spot and became aneurysmal at the seat of the ligature, and required a subse- quent operation for its cure. In addition to that, Mr. Barwell, whom I mentioned just now, as having probably had more cases of double ligature of the carotid and subclavian than any other surgeon, intro- duced a ligature which he thinks very highly of, but of which I have no personal experience, and it is made from the ox aorta. The aorta of the ox is prepared, and the middle coat of it, the thick elastic coat, is rendered aseptic. Mr. Barwell ties the artery with that, and he has had very good success with it, but I do not believe that it is really very much better than catgut or silk. Until of late years the surgeon, following Dr. Jones's teaching, always tied the artery as tightly as he couldâ€”that is to say, he tied it until he felt the giving way of the tissues beneath the ligature, and he tied usually with a reef knot, which I need hardly tell you is a very firm knot, which does not slip.

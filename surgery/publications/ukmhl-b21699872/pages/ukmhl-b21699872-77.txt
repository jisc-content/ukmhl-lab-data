Then we found, as I had anticipated, that the bougie had passed through the stricture, impinging upon the softened part of the bowel above it, and had penetrated into the peritoneum. That is by no means a solitary instance of the kind in surgery. Of course each such case causes great regret, and the occurrence should be guarded against as much as possible. I show you an instrument here merely for the purpose of warning you against using it, viz., a very powerful dilator, which was invented for these strictures by a surgeon now deceased â€”Mr. Armstrong Todd. You will notice that, when I turn the handle, there is an ingenious arrangement of cross-bars by which the two blades are widely separated.

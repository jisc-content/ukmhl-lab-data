194 ON DISEASES OF THE JOINTS every six hours, and at the same time if you cover up the joint with belladonna—a fomen- tation outside is a convenient way of doing it —and let the patient lie quiet in bed, these oases get well very rapidly and without any subsequent trouble. I may say that gonor- rhceal rheumatism is held by some people to be a very troublesome and difficult thing to treat, and very likely to leave behind it anky- losis of a spurious nature—false ankylosis of the joint. I do not find that to be the fact. I find that with 5-grain doses of quinine I can cure these cases rapidly, and that within a week or two they are able to go out with a perfectly healthy joint. Of course, one puts on a band- age afterwards, to support the joint; but I mean that these patients are not confined for weeks, as they used to be, in splints,^ and they certainly do not lose the use of their joints.

If the mflammation is exceed- ingly acute, or if the patient's health is broken down somewhat by previous excesses, it is quite possible that suppuration may take place. Of course, if there is some septic matter in the joint, then it is almost certain that the jomt will suppurate. I do not know that there is anything more

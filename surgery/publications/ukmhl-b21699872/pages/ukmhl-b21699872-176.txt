l6o ON THE DISTAL LIGATURE IN THE beautiful preparation in the College of Surgeons' museum shows that a cure of the innominate aneurysm had been effected. Wickham tied both vessels consecutively m 1839 unsuccess- fully, and Malgaigne tied the carotid and axillary consecutively in 1845 unsuccessfully. In 1843 Rossi for the first time tied both the carotid and subclavian simultaneously, but appears to have placed his ligature to the inner side of the scalenus, thus tying the first part of the artery. Death followed in six days from insufl&cient blood supply to the brain. Cuvellier tied both vessels simultaneously in 1859, but his case was not published till much later. The patient died. In November 1865, at the Westminster Hospital, I tied the right common carotid and the third part of the subclavian in a woman of thirty, suffering from what I and many other surgeons believed to be an innominate aneurysm."* She recovered from the opera- tion, and her condition greatly improved, the tumour subsiding and all pressure symptoms disappearing, but pulsation never being arrested. I brought the case before the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society in December 1866,t and it excited a good deal of discussion, but it was not published in the Medico-Chirurgical Transactions. My patient was a drimkard * Lancet, December 2, 1865. f Ihid. January 5,1867.

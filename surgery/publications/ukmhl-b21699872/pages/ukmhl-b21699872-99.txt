ON TETANUS 83 get well; but I thought it right to use the drugs, and I have not any doubt that they have done him good. In acute tetanus there was a drug that was once much in vogue, viz., calabar bean, which is used by ophthalmic surgeons to contract the pupil. It was thought that we might get some benefit by giving it in tetanus, but I have tried it and find this, that unless you give almost poisonous doses you produce no effect at all, and when you push the drug so as to contract the pupils strongly and to produce almost poisonous effects, the patients die all the same if it is an acute case, and they get well if it is a chronic one. You will remember that some few years ago nerve-stretching was in vogue, and was going to cure all sorts of things—■ locomotor ataxy and many other diseases. When it was in fashion, several surgeons with cases of tetanus tried stretching the nerves, and I have here notes of one or tAvo cases of that kind, and the inference I draw is that in a case of nerve-stretching in which the patient was suffering from acute tetanus he always died eventually. A case that recovered was probably a chronic one, and in that case I particularly note that the stretching was not very thoroughly carried out. The tetanus antitoxin is difiicult to procure. When I heard of this case I went at once to

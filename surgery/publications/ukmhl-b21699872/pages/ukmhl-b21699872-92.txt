ON TETANUS 76 are no distinct remissions, whereas we have in convulsions distinct remissions of spasm, and these we call clonic. And even in tetanus we get from time to time, in a bad case, an access of spasm of a clonic description, by which I mean that there is a sudden spasm, lasting perhaps for a minute, which throws the patient on the head and the heels; it then passes off, and in that way it is clonic, but the general rigidity never passes away. These convulsions are very serious, because it is in one of these attacks that the patient usually dies. You find that the patient is thrown into opisthotonos, his back is arched, and he rests on his head and heels, there is spasm of all the muscles of inspiration, his chest is fixed and he ceases to breathe. If that lasts for less than a minute, the patient, though exhausted, begins to breathe again; but if it goes on for two or three minutes, the patient falls back dead, and that is the usual conclusion of these acute cases.

The majority of these cases are traumatic, and the form of trauma which more frequently leads to tetanus than any other is a lacerated wound, and every now and then in a wound you may find a branch of nerve exposed.

He dis- tinctly says in his work: "If it is impossible to tie the artery close to the aneurysm, why not go further off and tie it where there is a healthy artery? " and that is exactly what he aimed at, and accordingly he tied the artery in what is commonly known as Hunter's canal â€”I mean, of course, the fibrous canal occupy- ing the middle third of the thigh.

Nowadays, every surgeon who ties the femoral, goes a Httle higher and ties it in what is known as Scarpa's triangle, but that is simply because it is more convenient. The operation is exactly the same as that which Hunter did, although we are more careful nowadays than Hunter was, certainly in his first and second cases, not to mclude ^ the vem; for it is very remarkable that it is quite clear, both from Hunter's own account, and also from the specimen which is in the College of Surgeons' Museum, in England, that Hunter deHberately tied in'the vein with the artery, and yet the patient recovered.

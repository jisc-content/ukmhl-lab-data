A CENTURY OF SURGERY 29 I think, rapid lithotrity. As practised by most surgeons nowadays, it consists in putting the patient under the influence of an anaesthetic, and breaking up the stone into small dust by a series of manipulations at one sitting; and then, by means of a powerful evacuating bottle, drawing out the fluid contained in the bladder and all remains of the stone. This method of Bigelow's has no doubt opened up quite neAv features in the operation of lithotrity, and has enabled the surgeon to treat cases of stone which he would never have ventured to deal with by that method without the instruments which Bigelow devised. Then, comparatively lately, within the last twenty years, there has been a recurrence to an old operation which dates probably many centuries back, namely, the suprapubic opera- tion of lithotomy; and it is a curious fact that Cheselden, the great lithotomist, undoubtedly at one time performed the suprapubic operation in preference to the lateral, which, as I have said, became his favourite method of proceeding. Petersen, a Danish surgeon, deserves the credit of having brought this suprapubic method again into practice. He showed, what every anatomist knew, that by distending the bladder with fluid it could be raised up suffi- ciently to avoid any danger of opening the peritoneum, when an incision was made abovo

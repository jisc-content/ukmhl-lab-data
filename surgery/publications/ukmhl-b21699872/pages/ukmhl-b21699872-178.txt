162 ON THE DISTAL LIGATURE IN THE follow the suggestion as regards the left carotid. But when the disease involves the ascending portion of the arch, I believe the only hope of success will be in tying both the right carotid and subclavian, so as to diminish as far as possible the current through the innomi- nate." My example of applying double simultaneous ligatures in cases of presumed innominate aneurysm was followed by several surgeons * with varying degrees of success; and in 1877 Mr. Barwell thus operated upon four patients, one of whom died from the anaesthetic, and three survived for various periods, one as long as two years, the aneurysm proving to be mainly aortic, so that all are claimed as having been cured. Mr. Langlcy Browne also had a success- ful case in 1881, which survived for two years, and in whom all symptoms of aneurysm sub- sided. I did not myself have the opportunity of repeating the double ligature until the year 1887, when a patient with presumably in- nominate aneurysm was transferred to my care by Dr. Bastian. For the following notes of the case, which have not hitherto been published, I have to thank Mr. Drew, late Surgical Registrar of University College Hospital. F.

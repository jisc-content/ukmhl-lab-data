226 ON ANEURYSM your hand, and immediately becomes full-sized and pulsates freely. Now, in a bony tumour that is not the case. It takes four or five beats of the heart before the pumping of the blood into the tumour brings it up to its full size again. That is so characteristic that it serves, I think, to distinguish those two im- portant classes of cases. Then, in addition to pulsation, as a rule we have a Imitâ€”that is to say, on listening to the aneurysm you will hear a rush of blood into it, which produces that peculiar sound which we call a hruit. The occurrence of the hriiit depends very much upon the size of the aperture, upon the shape of the aneurysm, and upon the direction the blood takes m rushing into the aneurysm. Then there are h'uits, of course, occasionally to be heard, which are not due to aneurysm. It is possible, with the edge of a stethoscope, so to press upon an artery as to produce something very like a hruit. Again, in the region of the heart, in the case of the large vessels, the aorta and the branches of the thoracic aorta, it is possible that a sound propagated by diseased valves of the heart may be carried on into the artery, and may, in some respects, imitate the hruit of an aneurysm. But with care I think that can be made out. Lastly, I would put the symptoms of pres-

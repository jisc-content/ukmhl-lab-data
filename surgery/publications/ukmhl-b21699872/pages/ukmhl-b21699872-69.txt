The modern after-treatment is much more humane than the old plan, for it used to be the practice to poke some lint into the fistula every day, which gave an infinity of pain. I never have a fistula dressed at all. I thoroughly lay it open, trim it up, rub a little iodoform along it, and then lay in it a little cotton-wool. I do not plug up the rectum, but put a suppository into it and let the patient go to bed. In a day or two he has his bowels relieved, and that brings away the small piece of cotton in the fistula, after which the dresser or nurse syringes out the fistula with a little red lotion twice a day, and the patient experi- ences no pain. In fact the operation for fistula is now a comparatively simple matter.

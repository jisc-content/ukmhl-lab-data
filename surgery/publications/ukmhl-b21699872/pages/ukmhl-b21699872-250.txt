Now, the Hunterian operation, the operation first performed by Hunter, is claimed by the French surgeons. You will find that it is often said that Desault tied an artery above the aneurysm ; and you will find that Broca, even, in his book on aneurysm, speaks of the opera- tion which we call the Hunterian as being a French operation, or Anel's.

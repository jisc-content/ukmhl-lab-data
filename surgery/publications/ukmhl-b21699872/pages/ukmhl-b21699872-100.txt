Tizzoni and Catani are the pathologists who have worked principally at this subject, and Roux and Vallard have also studied the matter. By inoculating animals, horses and so on, they were eventually able to get immunity, and the serum of these animals becomes the " tetanus antitoxin," and it is this that is injected. It was of no use to inject such a small quantity as Dr. Martin happened to have by him, for he told me that we should require a very large quantity of antitoxin, and, therefore, not having the amount necessary for the treatment, it was not begun. Clarke, of Leicester, seems to have been the first doctor in this country to carry out the treatment, and his case recovered. He injected 100 grains in twenty-four hours, and went on for some days. Dr. Kanthack, of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, gained the other day the Jacksonian prize on the subject of tetanus: he has been working at the subject for some time, and I hope that his essay, which will shortly be pubHshed, will bo widely read.

ON ANEURYSM* I The subject I propose to speak on this morning is that of aneurysm. I will define aneurysm shortly as being a pulsating tumour in direct communication with an artery. There are sundry varieties of aneurysm described, and I think that some of the distinctions and differences which are made are really uncalled for. I will venture to define a true aneurysm as an aneurysm which consists of one or more of the coats of the artery. No one can say positively, during the life of the patient, whether one or more coats of the artery may not be more or less absorbed; but I think it is possible, in the great majority of cases, to say pretty positively whether the coats of the artery still form the sac; and so long as that is the case, I am content to call it a true aneurysm. A false aneurysm I shall define as one in * One of the Lane Course of Medical Lectures, delivered at Cooper Medical College, Sau Francisco, September 2i, 1897.

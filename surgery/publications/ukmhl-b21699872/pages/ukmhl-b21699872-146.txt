The symptoms the patient exhibits will vary much m different cases; in some they are simply those of concussion of the bram. The only thing, then, to say is that the patient has had a serious accident, that he was insensible for a short time and is now recovering, and we must be careful with him for a few days. I have seen such cases recover, although some days later I have been aware that there had been a fracture after all, and for this reason : the fracture may run through the temporal bone and involve in some way the aqueductus Fallopii, through which the facial nerve passes; and the proof of the fracture having occurred is that, ten days or so afterwards, the patient gets paralysis on that side of his face. The fissure, if it runs through the temporal bone, becomes repaired, and repair may occur^ with an excess of callus, which causes compression of the facial nerve in the canal and produces paralysis. In another fortnight, when the callus is absorbed, the nerve resumes its func- : tion and the patient recovers. It is well to be on the safe side, and to prognosticate what may possibly happen, for if you have said that there is nothing the matter with the patient, and that he is able to go about his work, on any- ! thmg happenmg, such as this facial paralysis, '|

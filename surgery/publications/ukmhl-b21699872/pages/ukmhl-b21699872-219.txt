In these cases, then, we may take it that the disease has gone beyond the synovial membrane, the cartilages must have been, to a certain extent, involved, and the bones at least hypersemic. It does not follow that the bone is necessarily carious, and it is only when it is very extensively carious that we get anything Hke grating of the bones. In these cases modern surgery has been able to do a good deal. Up to the time of the introduction of ana3sthetics—I presume you all know that anaesthetics were introduced in 1846—up to that time, and a Httle later, the only operation which was ever undertaken for a diseased joint was to amputate the limb above it; and in all the older museums of London, and in England generally, and in fact everywhere, you will find beautiful specimens of diseased knee-joints which came from patients whose limbs were amputated as the only method of curing them. It was only by the efforts of Syme, Liston, and Fergusson—for those were the three men who had most to do with it—that excision or resection of the joints came into practice.

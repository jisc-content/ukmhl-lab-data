S8 ON STRICTURE OF THE RECTUM he infers tlaat the morbid changes involve the submucous tissues rather than the mucous coat. Zeissl, on the other hand, states that the lesion is due to gummatous infiltration of the submucous tissue. The disintegration of the deposit causes ulceration of the free borders of the longitudinal folds and of the mucous membrane between adjacent folds. When cicatrisation takes place, some of these folds are either obliterated or become adherent to each other; in either case the calibre of the bowel is reduced. Zeissl further states that distinct gummata are sometimes developed in the submucous tissue, and are followed by disintegration, ulceration, and severe stricture. He reports a case of this nature occurring in a man, presenting also syphilitic nodes and sarcocele." You will see, therefore, that there is a difference of opinion; but I think we may say that the weight of authority is in favour of there being gummatous deposit in the walls of the rectum. The only point which at all favours the view that there may be some infil- tration from the vagina to the rectum, is the notorious fact that these strictures are infin- itely more common in women than in men. Be the cause what it may, there can be no question how the disease comes onâ€”that there is first a deposit and then ulceration, and that during ulceration there is profuse discharge.

176 ON THE DISTAL LIGATURE IN THE restored to its natural shape, or if anything is a little flatter now than its fellow. On palpa- tion, the heaving impulse formerly existing over the right anterior chest wall is almost entirely gone. On percussion, the right anterior chest wall, formerly so dull, has, to a considerable extent, recovered its normal con- dition " {Clin. Soc. Trans, vol. vi. 1873). Various theories have been advanced to account for the formation of laminated clot in these cases. The simplest was that it depended upon the enforced rest in bed following the operation; but the fact is, that in every case the effect of prolonged rest in bed had been tried for many weeks without the slightest benefit. Next, it was suggested that the clot, beginning at the point of ligature, spread down into the aneurysm, and thus led to the formation of a coagulum in the sac. This is contrary to fact, as shown in the several pre- parations, for in no smgle case was the left carotid involved in the sac, and it is noted that the small thread-Uke clot, which, in some instances, spread down the carotid, in one case only extended into the aorta, and joined that in the aneurysm. I maintain the view which I have always held about these cases, viz., that the distal Hgature affects the current of blood in the aneurysm, probably by retardmg it and thus causes it to flow around the sac

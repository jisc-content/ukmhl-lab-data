THE HUNTERIAN ORATION 303 showed how erroneous was the then received practice of invariably opening out bullet wounds. His paper on " Inflammation " also was to a great degree founded upon observa- tions made at Belleisle, and in it he constantly refers to cases which came under his notice there. Having thus added largely to his surgical experience, Hunter returned to London in 1763 at the conclusion of the war, and devoted himself to what little surgery came in his way, but worked hard at those researches in anatomy and physiology which have ren- dered his name immortal. In 1768 he was elected surgeon to St. George's Hospital, where he enjoyed for five-and-twenty years the opportunity of practising surgery before an admirmg crowd of pupils, many of whom attamed eminence in later life. Hunter was then in his fortieth year, which may be fairly considered a surgeon's prime; and it is not wonderful that he attracted as his pupils men like Jenner, Home, Carlisle, Abernethy, and Astley Cooper. It is to be regretted that we have so little contemporary information respecting Hunter as a clinical teacher. That he did teach in the wards of St. George's there can be no doubt, for it is impossible to imagine Hunter failing to observe, to record, and to annotate verbally

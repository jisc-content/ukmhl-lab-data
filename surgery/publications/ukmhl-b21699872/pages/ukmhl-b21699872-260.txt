ON ANEURYSM 244 have been cured—and probably was cured for a time—^but for tlie unfortunately intemperate habits of the patient. If you look into the surgical works published subsequent to that date, and particularly in Erichsen's Surgery, in the edition after my double ligature it was put down, of course, as a case of innominate aneurysm. After the post-mortem, in the next edition, naturally Erichsen altered the statement, and showed that it was an aortic aneurysm. The con- sequence has been that I think that case is sometimes overlooked, because when I. come to look at the surgical works of the day I find very often that my case is not mentioned ; and the explanation is really that it was at first considered innominate, and then turned out to be aortic, and that between the two statements the case has been somewhat misunderstood. My case, although it turned out to be aortic, had a very marked effect upon the minds of other EngUsh surgeons. Several cases of double ligature were undertaken, some of them successful and some not, and I think I ought to mention especially, in connection with that subject, the name of Mr. Barwell, who has probably appHed the double ligature more frequently than any other surgeon, both for cases of innominate and also for cases of aortic aneurysm.

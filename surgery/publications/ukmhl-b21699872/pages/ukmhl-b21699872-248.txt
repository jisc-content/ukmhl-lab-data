It is astonishing how little liquid a patient can do with if he sips it. I mean that it is not really essential that we should take large draughts of fluid, although, of course, they are very pleasant. A patient in that condition can do with remarkably little fluid if he takes it in sips spread over the day. He thus gets rid of his thirst, and the thirst can also be met by giving him some ice to suck ; and by those means there is no question that a good deal of efiect can be produced upon internal aneurysms, and upon external aneurysms also, where other methods of treatment may also be tried. So much for the medical treatment. Surgical treatment, of course, applies mainly to aneurysms of the limbs. Of late years, also, we have had to deal with aneurysms of the

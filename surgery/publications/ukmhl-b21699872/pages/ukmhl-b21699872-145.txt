THE BASE OF THE SKULL I 29 the bone, and then the fracture " runs round "; and here you see in this case that the fracture ran round, not only on the right side, but extended to the left, and opened up both orbits. There is an old theory that a man can fracture the base of his skull by falling on his feet, but you must clearly understand that if a man falls from a height on to his feet, he breaks first his legs, and then his thighs, and that the pelvis and the vertebrffi are fractured long before the base of the skull is affected; and, in fact, that it is impossible for the mere shock of falling on the feet to fracture the base of the skull. There have been very curious cases where the base of the skull has been fractured from patients falling violently on to the chin, sometimes not breaking the lower jaw, but driving the condyle of the lower jaw through the glenoid fossa into the skull and so fracturmg the base, but they are very rare cases mdeed. With regard to the different parts of the skull, of course the lines the fracture takes will depend entirely upon where the blow was struck. Sometimes the fractures run right through the orbital plate. Though the orbital plate is very thin, the horizontal plate of the ethmoid is much thinner, being about as thick as an egg-shell, therefore it is not very surprising that fracture occurs from

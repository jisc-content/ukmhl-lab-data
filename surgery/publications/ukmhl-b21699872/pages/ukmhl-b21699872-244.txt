228 ON ANEURYSM the outer layer nearest the vessel wall was the more organised. That alone ought to have shown them that it was the oldest part. But the conclusion drawn by all the older surgeons was that it was an effusion of plastic material from the coat of the aneurysm. I merely mention that Professor Macewen, of Glasgow, who was lecturing here last year and whom you all know, has lately revived this notion, and in certain cases has irritated the inner lining of the aneurysm by introducing a needle, which he has allowed to scrape against it, with a view of producing a plastic material there, and so thickening the coat of the artery. The whole subject is still sub judice, and in order that I might do Professor Macewen justice, I wrote to him just before I left England, and asked him whether he was still pursuing the plan, and with what success. He wrote me back an answer which I received since I have been here, to say that he still used it in appropriate cases ; but, of course, that is not saying very much. He is the only surgeon, so far as I know, who holds the view that it is possible to produce an effusion of plastic material beneficially on the inner coat of an artery. All other pathologists are agreed that the cure of an aneurysm depends upon the deposit of clot from the blood running through the aneurysm.

This may seem a dan- gerous proceeding, but it is not so hazardous as one might think, though you must neverthe- less be very careful to avoid making a simple fracture compound. In the average case, however, you can set the fracture in the way I have described with- out much trouble, and in compound fractures you can manage it with greater ease, and, moreover, you can insert your finger and feel if the two ends are in accurate apposition. In compound fractures also you will be able to thoroughly investigate the possible presence of a spiculum of bone preventing accurate apposi- tion, and no one would hesitate to push the bone out of the wound and saw off such a projecting spiculum. In cases of compound fracture, where you find, the moment after you have set the limb, that the bones become dis- placed again, it would be quite within the bounds of good surgery to divide the tendo Achilhs subcutaneously, or to drill the two fragments and put in pegs or screws to hold the bones together; and I may say that this method of pegging or screwing has been recom- mended by an enterprising surgeon, not only for compound but also for simple fractures. But I cannot conceive how any one can believe that it is justifiable to convert a simple into a

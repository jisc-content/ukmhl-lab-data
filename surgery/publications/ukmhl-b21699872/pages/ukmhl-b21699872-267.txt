ON ANEURYSM 251 if necessary, to relieve the pain. There is, also, a more complicated arrangement by Carte, a Dublin surgeon, which is sometimes useful, but not, perhaps, essential. Let me mention here, so as not to omit it, the method which was brought into vogue a few years ago by Dr. Reid, a naval surgeon of England—the use of Esmarch's bandage and cord, for the treatment of aneurysm of the popliteal artery. Dr. Reid had a case in a sailor, and he bethought him that if he could stagnate the blood in the popliteal aneurysm and the whole leg, for an hour or two, prob- ably a cure would be effected. Accordingly, he put Esmarch's bandage on the limb, and then, having carried the cord around so as to keep the blood perfectly stagnant, he put the patient under the influence of chloroform for an hour or two—for the pain was too great to be borne without—and a cure re- sulted. I used the plan on two occasions some years ago, and I may say that I think it is very important that the aneurysm should be full of blood. Therefore, I do not hesitate to bandage the Hmb from below up to the aneurysm with Esmarch's elastic bandage, and to bandage also from above downwards with another elastic bandage, and then put the cord around, so that I am sure the aneurysm is full of blood;

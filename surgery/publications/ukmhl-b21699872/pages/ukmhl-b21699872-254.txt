ON ANEUKYSM 238 probability, within twenty-four hours, some- times earlier and sometimes later, that a slight pulsation is to be felt in the aneurysm again. That indicates not failure but cure, because it shows that the collateral circulation is sufficient to bring blood to the aneurysm, in a small quantity it is true, but quite sufficient just to give an impulse. It is that blood which will deposit the clot within the sac and produce the cure, and it is from that blood, running through the aneurysm for the next twenty- four or forty-eight hours, or even for a longer time, that the clot is deposited on the wall of the aneurysm, and eventually fills it up, and then the aneurysm becomes absolutely solid. After that, in the course of some weeks, shrinking takes place, absorption of the colour- ing material of the blood and of the clot occurs, and then, finally, we have a mass, partly coat of the artery, partly indurated, colourless clot, and eventually, if the patient lives long enough, the whole mass is converted into fibrous tissue. That, of course, is the most successful result which can take place, but it does not always happen. There are accidents following the ligature, from no fault of the surgeon, which I think I ought to allude to. In the first place, we may have a persistent pulsation. I mean that the pulsation may return in the sac very quickly, and it may go

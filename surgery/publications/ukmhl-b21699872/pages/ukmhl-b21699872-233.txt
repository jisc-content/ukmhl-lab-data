ON DISEASES OF THE JOINTS 21/ The result of these operations being so very unsatisfactory, Mr. Syme suggested that it would be better to cut in by an oblique incision, and to slip the foreign body—for it was practically a foreign body—out of the joint, but to leave it beneath the skin. That operation proved to be a very satisfactory one, and it was followed up by Mr. Square, of Plymouth, who had a large number of very successful cases, making a free subcutaneous incision into the joint, slipping the loose carti- lage out under the skin, and leaving it there until the joint became quiet, and then either removing it or possibly leaving it altogether. That was the practice up to the time, twenty years ago, when the Listerian treatment came in, and now we all, of course, cut directly into the joint, and take out the loose cartilage, with strict antiseptic precautions, and with the very best results. It is very much better that it should be done in that way, because it is done so much more quickly and so much more readily; and, moreover, you are quite sure that you get all the bodies out, for very often there are two or three, and it is, of course, no use removing one, you must remove the whole number. It is readily done by making an incision straight into the joint with strict antiseptic precautions, and then emptying out the joint, closing the wound,

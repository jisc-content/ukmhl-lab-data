In this case I think I succeeded in getting the bones into very fair position, and the fracture was then put up in plaster, fixing both the hip and knee-joints. At the end of a fortnight, however, the patient again required our attention, because the plaster had given way at the groin and wanted repairing. I had fresh plaster put on outside the old at the groin and let the man go away till after Christmas, when he is to return, so that I can take the plaster off myself and see how the case has progressed.

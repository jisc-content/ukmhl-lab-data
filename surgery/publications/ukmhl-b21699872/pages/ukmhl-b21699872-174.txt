15 8 ON THE DISTAL LIGATURE IN THE Deschamps, his cotemporary, first applied a distal ligature in a case of large femoral aneurysm, but the tumour increased so rapidly in size that, four days later, the old operation of opening the sac (Antyllus) was performed, and the patient sank from haemorrhage. Sir Astley Cooper adopted the operation in a case of aneurysm of the external iliac, tying the common femoral, and the tumour diminished considerably, but eventually burst and killed the patient. James Wardrop now took up the subject, and in 1825 tied the common carotid for aneurysm of the root of that vessel with success, the patient being alive and well three years later. In 1826 Wardrop had a second similar case, but the patient died four months later from causes unconnected with the operation, and the post-mortem examination showed no distinct aneurysm, only " a manifest dilatation " of the carotid corresponding to the position of the tumour present before the operation, and the artery was pervious throughout. Wardrop was followed in 1827 by Lambert, whose patient died two months later from haemorrhage at the site of ligature, and by Bush, of New York, whose patient was cured. In 1827 Wardrop performed what he termed his " new operation " by tying the third part of the subclavian artery in a case of innominate

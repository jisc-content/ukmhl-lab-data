ON FKACTURES OF THE LOWER LIMB 23 Hodgen's splint (Fig. 3) is much in use at method of weiglit-extension was more con- venient It would be a little awkward to put up a fracture of both thighs with Liston's splints, unless you used an apparatus such as Bryant's, consisting of two long splmts and a cross-bar, the extension being made by an india-rubber accumulator. I am quite content, however, to treat a case of this kind with weight-extension, using retentive spHnts around the fracture; but then there are two or three points to which you must give particular atten- tion. The plaster by which the extension is maintained must be taken above the knee. This is not so well known as it should be; for you occasionally find that a house-surgeon has apphed the plaster up the leg, but has stopped below the knee, the result being that the knee- joint is pulled upon and possibly damaged ; whereas, if the plaster be continued above the knee, you are applying weight-extension to the fractured bone, the necessary counter-extension being obtained by the weight of the patient's body. Sometimes it is found necessary to raise the foot of the bed, but usually the weight of the patient's body is sufficient, and it is seldom that you find yourself reduced to the necessity of using a perineal band attached to the head of the bed, except in cases of fracture in children.

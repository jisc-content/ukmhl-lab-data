ON MENINGOCELE AND ENOEPHALOCELE 93 bifida of the upper vertebras is extremely rare, it being most common in the lumbo-sacral region; therefore, if you meet with a case in which any doubt exists as to whether it is a spina bifida of the cervical region or an occipital meningocele, the chances are very much in favour of its being an occipital meningocele. Encephalocele of the posterior part of the skull is less common than simple meningocele. Mr. Power recorded in 1856 a case of this kind, in which the occipital region presented a soft tumour equal in size to a very large orange. The deformity had obstructed the labour, and forceps were employed for the extraction of the head, the child surviving nearly twenty-four hours. On dividing the mteguments in the middle line over the tumour, they were found to blend with the .dura mater, the vertical plate of the occipital bone being entirely deficient, or replaced only by connective tissue. The arachnoid was well defined, and the vessels of the pia mater were extraordinarily numerous, large, and fully in- jected with blood. More than half the cerebral mass, comprising the whole of the posterior and part of the middle lobes of the hemisphere of the cerebrum, was contained in the tumour. The consistence of the brain was somewhat soft, but the distinction between

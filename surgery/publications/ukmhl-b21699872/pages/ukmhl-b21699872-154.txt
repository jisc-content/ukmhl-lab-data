ON CASES OF EPITHELIOMA AND RODENT ULCER Gentlemen,—We have lately liad in tlie wards a good many cases of epithelioma, and I want to draw your attention to some of their leading features, and to say a few words as to the diagnosis of the disease and its treatment. In the first place, let me say that epithelioma, otherwise called epithelial cancer, is a disease which affects various parts of the body, and somewhat differently in different positions. We have epithelioma of the mucous membrane and skin of various parts, particularly at the junctions of the skin with the mucous mem- brane—for instance, the lip, the nose, the penis, and so on ; and in all these parts the disease is the squamous epithehoma. I may say that I am going to confine my remarks to that variety, because I have nothing to say to- day about the columnar epithehoma, which occurs only where columnar epithelium exists— viz., in the intestines, and in the antrum of Highmore.

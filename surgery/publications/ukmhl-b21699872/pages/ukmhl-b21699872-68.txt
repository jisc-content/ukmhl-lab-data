The commonest places for the mternal opening of fistula are either between the two sphincters or immedi- ately above the internal sphincter, though the fistula may occasionally run higher up. In the slight cases, when the internal opening is once found, there is no difficulty about the operation. All you have to do is to slip a probe-pointed I director into the external opening, and insin- uate it along the fistula to the internal opening; then, guided by your finger introduced into the rectum, bring the point out through the anus, and run a sharp-pointed bistoury along the groove to divide all the tissues. That is far better than the old plan, which was this: The surgeon took a blunt-pointed bistoury and in- sinuated it up the fistula, then met it with the finger at the internal opening and withdrew them together, cutting through all the tissues. But what I have described does not complete the operation in many cases, because some of these fistulae are extremely chronic, and they branch in more than one direction, and you will not cure your patient by laying open only one branch. Having laid open the several fistulas, it is a good plan to remove with sharp scissors the overhanging skin, because these edges may fall together and practically close

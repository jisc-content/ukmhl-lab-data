TUBEECULAR JOINT-DISEASE 107 Well, you have of course to get rid of the cause, and you should also feed your patient up well. J have ordered him quinine, and I think quinine is good for every condition of septic mischief. I have ordered him 2 grs. of quinine three times a day; he has also been ordered some brandy, and when he is tired of that he is to have beer or wine, and if he can manage it I wish him to take also cod-liver oil. That will improve his condition; and for his sweating I have ordered that he shall be sponged with hot water and vinegar at night. Physicians in these cases use belladonna, atropine, or oxide of zinc, and mineral acids. I have more faith in the mineral acids than in the oxide of zinc, and I generally combine the qumine with the mineral acid. I use the old-fashioned vinegar and hot water sponging in cases of sweating, and then have the patient well dried ; and you will find that after it he will generally drop off to sleep. The patient must not sleep in linen. I know myself concerning that fact, because twelve years ago I had a very serious illness and nearly died, and I sweated very profusely, and suffered from the misery of waking up in' the morning with my night-shirt dripping wet. It IS a point of importance that patients under these conditions should wear flannel, and it is a thing to bear in mind in all cases where night sweats occur.

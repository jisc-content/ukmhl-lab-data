In a paper pubhshed in the Lancet of July 2, 1870,1 gave the details of the above interesting case in full, and will quote one passage from it: "The preceding case appears to raise a very important question in practical medicine and surgeryâ€”whether in cases of aneurysm of the arch of the aorta it is not possible to afford reHef by surgical interference.

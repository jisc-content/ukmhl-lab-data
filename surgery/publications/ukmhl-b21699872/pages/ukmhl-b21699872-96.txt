Formerly we thought it was something wrong with the medulla oblongata and spinal cord, for all that was known was that, after death from convulsions, it was generally found that there was more or less injection of the medulla oblongata and spinal cord, and of the mem- branes of the brain; that was common to hydrophobia and also to strychnine poisoning, and to any case of convulsions.

A Japanese student, Kitasato, working in a German laboratory in 1889, was the first to isolate it, and show that there was such a distinctive bacillus. Now that bacillus, if you have ever the opportunity of seeing it, is remarkable in its shape, and no mistake about it is possible ; it is called the drumstick bacillus, for it has a spherical head with a straight tail coming down ; from it, and the name " drumstick bacillus " represents fairly well the shape of it.

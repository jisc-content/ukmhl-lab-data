ON ANEURYSM than that, Mr. Ballance has tried to convince surgeons that they are wrong in dividing the coats of the artery, and that it is suflficient to approximate them, and to hold them firmly by the ligature. So convinced is he of this that, going over the museum specimens, he has pointed out that in certain specimens the ligature appears to have slipped, and of this very specimen of mine—of a ligature of the left carotid—a drawing is given in his book, which seems to illustrate it. I was rather surprised when I read that, and I went and looked at the specimen and found that it and the drawing do not agree, and I do not beUeve for a moment that my ligature slipped. For my own part I believe it is entirely a mistake, and I wish to make a protest against the statement. I believe we have done perfectly rightly in following Jones's teaching in tying the artery as tightly as we can, in order to lead to the division of the middle coat, and I for one shall go on doing it. I believe that we have much greater safety for our patients in doing it; that the changes which take place after the ligature depend mainly upon dividing the coat, and that after mere approxi- mation there will be no very great difficulty for the current in the artery to be reproduced at some time or other.

We know, by examination of numerous specimens, that there is a deposit beneath the sjaiovial membrane in the connective tissue between it and the surface of the bone ; that there we have a deposit which thickens the parts and of course necessarily limits the cavity of the joint, interfering, therefore, with its movements, and giving the characteristic roundness to the joint which we know is common enough in these chronic cases. These cases come to the hospital, and the question is. What is best to be done for them ? If we could do what would be best, it would be to send them all down to the seaside, no doubt; but that is not possible, and then we have to do the best we can for them, and that is generally to endeavour to fix the jomt by means of some light apparatusâ€”not keeping the patient in bed, because that really is very important. The beds of the poor in London are generally in very small rooms, which are only badly ventilated, and it is very much better that a poor child should go out on crutches, if it is only into the little court where the house is, rather than be shut up m the house itself with all the bad air there

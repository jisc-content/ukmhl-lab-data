ON DISEASES OF THE JOINTS 195 difficult than to be quite sure, positively certain, that a joint has suppurated. You see a joint full of fluid; you find considerable tension- you have a sharp rise of temperature, and you will claim, m all probability, that the joint has suppurated, and I should say so, too; but I should be very loth to cut into that joint without first aspirating it. It seems to me wrong to run the possible risk of such a serious mistake as cutting into a joint which has not suppurated, when it is easy to ascertain what the condition is by means of the aspirator Another reason why you may advantageously aspu-ate the jomt is that I am quite sure there are cases where suppuration is only just begm- nmg^where the fluid is not actually' puruLt, but where it is synovial fluid loaded with white corpuscles, that will m the course of a very few hours become purulent. I feel quite sure, from cases I have had, that you can cut that inflai^ mation short by washing the joint out with a 1.40 solution of carbolic acid. I have had several cases of that kmd where the jolt was wh w^' ^^^pp-^'-" 11 V 1 ^'^^ pint with a sphnt and the patient has recovered without actual suppuration takino place Bâ€žtTf

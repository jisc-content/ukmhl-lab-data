ON TETANUS 8l just now of the surgeon's son, wlio fell from his horse and had a considerable quantity of earth rubbed into the wound, is only one of many examples; and although we have no evidence of earth bacillus in the case which I am considering now, still the man's boot would have contained dirt, and his feet probably were not very clean, therefore the inoculation might have been through the wound in the great toe. This gives a clue to the origin of tetanus and makes surgeons careful to clean every wound, because you never can tell which wound may be infected by the bacillus, and this yeems to be fairly common. Up to quite lately the treatment of tetanus was most unsatisfactory. You will find that, in the first place, it was recommended that amputation should be performed, and we still sometimes venture to amputate. In the case of a smashed thumb sent to me some years back, tetanic spasms had begun, and I ampu- tated the thumb to get a clean wound, but the patient died.

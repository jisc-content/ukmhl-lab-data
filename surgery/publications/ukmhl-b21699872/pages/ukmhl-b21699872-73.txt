He says: " Gummatous deposits and infiltration of the submucous tissue are the most common causes of syphilitic ulceration and stricture of the rectum. Fournier, however, dissents from this view, and thinks that, in the majority of cases of stricture of the rectum in syphilitic subjects, the condition is due to an infiltration of the ano-rectal walls with a new formation of unknown structure, a hyperplastic proctitis, which generally goes by the name of 'ano- rectal syphiloma,' and which has certain resem- blances to the fibroid degeneration seen in the nose and larynx. It undergoes fibroid changes, and produces contraction of the calibre of the bowel.

PBEFACE. In this volume I have collected a second series of the clinical lectures delivered by me in University College Hospital during the last few years, and have included two of the Lane Lectures given by me in the Cooper Medical College, San Francisco, in 1897. I have also added the Hunterian Oration delivered at the Eoyal College of Surgeons in the same year. 36 Cavendish Square, May 1902.

2«2 A CENTURY OF SURGERY feared the event. However, just as they were going to begin the operation, Morton arrived, and he administered the ether and Warren performed his operation. The patient was perfectly quiet, absohitcly insensible, and would hardly beHeve, when he woke up, that the operation had been performed. Warren's com- ment upon it was, " Gentlemen, there is no humbug in this," and that was quite a true word, for it was from that date that anaesthesia began. We have there the commencement of anesthesia on October 17, 1846. The news of this Avas very soon sent across to England, and a dentist, Mr. Robinson, of Gower Street, extracted some teeth under the influence of ether. He invited Robert Listen to come and see a tooth extracted, and then Listen himself, on December 22, 1S4G, performed two opera- tions in University College Hospital—in this very theatre—an amputation of the thigh, and the removal of a toe-nail, both operations, I needly hardly say, being excessively painful ones. The patients were put under the in- fluence of ether by Dr. William Squire, who has only recently died, and with complete success. The news, of course, spread rapidl}^ to Glasgow and Edinburgh, and within a day or two the thing was there repeated, and so antesthesia became an established fact in Europe.

Therefore, I think that, in justice to Wardrop, that operation should be called Wardrop's opera- tion. It fell to myself, in 1865, to have a case of aneurysm of the innominate artery, or at least what was thought to be of the innominate artery. There I united the two methods. I tied both the carotid and the subclavian at the same time. Let me say that this was by no means the first case in which the two opera- tions had been performed, but up to that date, so far as I know, the operations had been done at successive periods. There is a case of which I have a drawing hereâ€”a historical case by Mr. Fearn, m which he produced a cure. You will see that the innominate aneurysm has been cured by tying, first the subclavian, and then the carotid artery, but there was an mterval of some months between the two operations. It seemed to me, on thinking over the case and readmg up the Hterature, and having also the advice, I may say, of Mr. Erichsen, as he then was, who was a great authority upon aneurysm-it seemed to me that in this case of what we presumed to be innominate aneurysm

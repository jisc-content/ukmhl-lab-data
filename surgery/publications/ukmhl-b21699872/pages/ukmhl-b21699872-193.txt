TREATMENT OF ANEURYSM 177 instead of directly through or past it, and in this way leads to the deposit of laminated fibrin on the probably roughened wall of the sac. When this normal cure of the aneurysm has gone on for some time, there is no doubt a tendency for the small remaining cavity to become blocked with soft coagulum, and this is probably a critical moment for the patient, and may account for the sudden deaths which have occurred at considerable periods after the operation. An aneurysm which is semi- or completely solid must necessarily exercise much greater pressure on its surroundings than one which only contains fluid blood, whilst the sudden arrest of a stream of blood' through a-sac so near the heart, would be likely to interfere with its action and lead to syncope. _ It will thus be seen that of seven cases in which I have tied the left carotid as suggested by Dr. Cockle, the first was by far the most successful. In the second case the diagnosis was mcorrect, the aneurysm provmg to be mnommate, and the proper vessel to have tied would have been the right carotid, in the third case the embarrassment of breath- ing caused by the anaesthetic was so great that I abandoned its use in my subsequent opera- tions, and strongly advise the employment of

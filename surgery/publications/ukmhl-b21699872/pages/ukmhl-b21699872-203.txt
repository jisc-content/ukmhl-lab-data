Perhaps it will be convenient to deal with cases of puncture of the joint first, because one or two points of interest arise early in the case, and one has generally the opportunity, in a case of punctured joint, of seeing it from the first. Let us suppose then, for a moment, that a patient drops his pen-knife on his knee and punctures his knee-joint. What are the evi- dences ? In the first place there would be a httle bleeding, but very little, and then there would be an escape of synovial fluid from the interior of the joint, and nothing can be more easy to recognise than that, because it is exactly like the white of a fresh egg, and any one with the least power of observation would note the flow. There is just one fallacy which I think it well to mention in connection with It, viz., that it is possible that a puncture of the bursa in front of the patella may give rise to a fluid very, but not precisely, Hke that from the interior of the joint. But in the first place the position of the puncture would pretty well point out that it was the bursa and if any doubt arose about it, the suro-eon would be_ wise to thoroughly cleanse a p?obe and dip it into a httle carbolic solution to render it qmte aseptic, and then introduce the

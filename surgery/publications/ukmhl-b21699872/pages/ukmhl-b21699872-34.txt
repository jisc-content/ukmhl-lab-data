l8 ON FRACTUEES OF THE LOWER LIMB know well that there are many difficulties. Immediately after the accident all the muscles of the limb are more or less in a state of spasm, and tend, therefore, to pull the bones into abnormal positions; but that state of spasm passes off in the course of a few hours, and you can generally manage with care and patience to put the limb mto a proper posi- tion, and unless that is done, and done ac- curately, the surgeon has not treated the case properly. Looking at this specimen from the museum, you can. see that there has been a fracture of both the tibia and fibula, and the probabihty is that they were broken by direct violence, because the fractures are nearly opposite one another, whereas if the accident had occurred from indirect violence the fracture of the fibula would have taken place higher up. I therefore think that we shall be right in saying that this was a case of direct violence, causing, as you can see, very considerable displacement, the lower fragment of the tibia passuig behind the upper fragment. Union in this case has been very complete, abundance of callus having been thrown out, but the patient recovered with a shortened and deformed hmb. This is just the' class of case of which I was thinking when I emphasised the importance of thoroughly set- ting a fracture. In this case apparently there

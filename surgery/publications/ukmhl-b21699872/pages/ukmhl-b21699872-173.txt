ON THE DISTAL LIGATURE IN THE TREATMENT OF ANEURYSM We are now within two years of the end of the nineteenth century, and no doubt the progress of surgery during that period will be summed up by more or less competent persons. With the view of contributing to accuracy in dealing with the treatment of aneurysm, I wish to record a few facts relating to the use of the distal ligature, and to give my personal acquaintance with the subject. I am induced to do this because I find in the most recent works on surgery various inaccuracies, and I also note a tendency to ignore historical facts which are of interest. Brasdor is credited by Boyer with having proposed, at the end of the last century, to place a ligature on the distal side of' an aneurysm, instead of on the cardiac side as recommended by Hunter. Desault was in the habit of quoting Brasdor's proposal with ap- proval, but never carried it into practice.

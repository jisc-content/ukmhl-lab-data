ON ULCERS OF THE LEG 13 healthy action, which we call phagedsena. I am happy to say that' in our hospital it is many years since we have had an outbreak of phagedasna, and I trust we shall never have another; but still one ought to be able to recognise it, and the great feature is the grey surface of the ulcer, which spreads with con- siderable rapidity. These phagedsenic ulcers are undoubtedly, to my mind, connected with syphilis. The treatment is, in the first place, to isolate the patient, to destroy the surface with Nitric Acid, and then to bring the patient under the influence of Mercury. Modern surgery has very much facilitated the healing of large ulcers. M. Reverdin was the originator of the method we commonly call skin-grafting, which consists in taking a little piece of healthy cuticle with a pair of scissors and implanting it upon the surface of the ulcer. In the wards you have seen cases in which skin-grafting of this kind has been very useful. The advantage of it is that it forms islands in the middle of an ulcer from which proliferation and growth of cuticle can take place; and consequently a large ulcer can, by this method, be healed much more rapidly than if we only trusted to the granulations and to the growth of cuticle from the margin. But Prof. Thiersch, of Leipzig, has recently intro- duced a method of more extensive ^raftino-

0 2 ON STRICTURE OF THE RECTUM inconvenience tlaey found was that, when shutting the instrument prior to withdrawal, the mucous membrane was very apt to be caught between the blades and torn in withdrawal. To obviate that, the use of an indiarubber cover,resembling a long finger-stall, was suggested. By this means all the good points in the instrument are retained, and the bad avoided. But the danger is this: if you dilate a stricture sud- denly and forcibly, the tear is apt to run farther than you imagine, and you are in danger of going through the wall of the rectum. Cases are occasionally met with in which the contraction is exceedingly strong, and the stricture hard and tough, so that little progress can be made with the ordinary bougies. In such cases the best plan is to notch the stric- ture with a knife; it is very much safer than tearing. With your finger introduced into the stricture you slip up a blunt bistoury, and you can then, by using a little pressure, notch the stricture in three or four places. This, however, should only be done with patients who are â€¢ under your control; never do it to an out-patient, for fear of anything going wrong. The worst of these cases is that the disease is very apt to recur, owing to the fact that the mucous membrane is practically destroyed, and nothing is left but a mass of fibrous tissue, which is very apt to contract.

16 ON 'FRACTURES OF THE LOWER LIMB taken of the case, and by putting the two fractures up in plaster-of-Paris for another four weeks perfect union may be expected. You will remember that I said in the ward that it would be better to get the patient up and about, and I said this because, after a man has been lying in bed for four weeks, his strength begins to fail, and he will do better by getting about in a fixed apparatus than by lying on his back iri bed. , Let me here remind you of a case of absolute non-union -of a fracture of the femur, which was sent "up to the wards under my care a short â€¢time ago. Although the case had been well treated in the usual manner by perfectly com- petent surgeons, there was absolutely no union. I had that patient brought into this theatre, and under an anaesthetic I applied extension so as to bring the two parts of the fractured bone thoroughly together, and I also went through the manoeuvre of bending the bone at the seat of the fracture. It is possible, though I do not say it was so in this particular case, that the two surfaces of the broken bone had not been brought into close apposition. Some tissue, perhaps, may have been interposed between the two surfaces, and that would be quite enough to account for the non-union of the fracture. To have simply made extension would probably have been of jio use, and I therefore did what

Nothing could have done better. I used a catgut Ugature in that case and the wound healed by first intention. It was dressed aseptically, the man made a rapid recovery, and the symptoms of aneurysm became vastly ameliorated, so much so that it was impossible to prevent the patient, who was a labouring man in the country, from resuming his hard work. He would go to his work, and, unfortunately, as a result of that, the aneurysm began to grow again, and finally he died, in 1875, by bursting of the aneurysm externally. Then I was able to secure a post-mortem examination, and I found that there was no question that I had tied the left carotid, and there was a large clot in the aneurysm; and that the effect of the ligature had been practically to lead to very considerable deposit of fibrin in the sac, which, under more favourable circumstances, would have led to an absolute cure. The question is, what does the ligature do under those circumstances ? It is very difficult to explain. One view is that you simply cut off the current of blood to a certain extent, by stopping, its exit from the aneurysm; but that is not really so. The mere fact that you stop

148 ON CASES OF EPITHELIOMA was forty-two years of age at the time of the operation, which was in October 1887, and I have never heard more of her. One always hopes, when one does not hear, for satisfactory results, but it is not likely that she has gone on for ten years without further trouble. There is another disease, of which I believe we have an example here in the ward now, which is called rodent ulcer. Now I allow that it is very difficult to be sure in any case whether it is rodent ulcer or whether it is epithelioma.

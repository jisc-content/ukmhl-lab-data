ON COMMON DISEASES OF THE RECTUM 3$ to diagnose a diseased one. With your finger in the bowel you will be able to feel that there is more or less enlargement of the hsemor- rhoidal veins and hypertrophy of the mucous membrane around, forming prominences in the rectum of varying size. But let me advise you not to be satisfied with a mere digital examination, but make the patient use an enema and then strain, and you will often be surprised at the amount of hsemorrhoidal disease which will thus be brought into view. An operation may be contra-mdicated by the existence of pregnancy; and let me warn you never, if you can possibly avoid it, to do an operation upon a pregnant woman, for, however slight the operation may be, you will very Hkely produce abortion, from which very serious results may accrue. If it be a case in which operation is contra-indicated, you must, of course, temporise, and treat the patient in other ways; so also with many slight cases where the necessity for operation does not arise. The first thing, then, is to see that the patient's liver is doing its work properly, for in people with congested livers we very com- monly find internal piles. Again, persons who do not take proper exercise very often have large hajmorrhoidal veins, which bleed from time to time, but in them the loss of a little blood is rather beneficial than otherwise.

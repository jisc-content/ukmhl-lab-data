240 ON ANEURYSM can tell how thin it may be, and how little may be needed to rupture it. Now let us consider other methods of treat- ment beside the ligature applied by the Hun- terian method. In 1825 Mr. Wardrop, who was a London surgeon of some eminence, although he never belonged to one of the larger hospitals, published some remarkable cases of distal ligature. I mean cases in which he had applied the ligature for treatment, where he could not get on the proximal side of the aneurysm. For instance, he had a case of innominate aneurysm, in which he tied the carotid, and another in which he tied the third part of the subclavian. But he was not quite the originator of the method, because many years before, Brasdor is said—for it is rather a doubtful case—to have applied a ligature beyond an aneurysm, and therefore the operation has generally been called Brasdor's operation; and so far as the common carotid is concerned, Wardrop per- formed Brasdor's operation, because, as you will remember, if you tie the common carotid, there is no branch between the ligature and the aneurysm. But Wardrop did a good deal more than that. He tied the third part of the subclavian in one of his cases, and you will remember that between the ligature and the innominate there would be the

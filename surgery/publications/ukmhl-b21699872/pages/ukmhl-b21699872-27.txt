That is very easily done with- out any complicated irrigating apparatus, by ' making a syphon with a skein of worsted from a jug of tepid water, and allowing it to run over the surface of the ulcer. The water evaporates and produces cold, and if you wish to get a greater effect you can, of course, u ice into the water. But this woman has got something more than that: she has got gangrene of a large surface of skin; and that, of course, must take time to separate and come aAvay. She is in a very low state of health, and I doubt whether she will survive long ; but there is the ulcer, and we must get away the slough, at the same time taking care, as far as possible, of the patient's strength. Now in the wards I have ordered that she shall have Iodoform poultices applied, and we shall gradually get the slough away.

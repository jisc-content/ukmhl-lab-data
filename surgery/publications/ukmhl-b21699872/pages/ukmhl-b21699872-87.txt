ON STRICTURE OF THE RECTUM /I peritonecal cavity open, that the patient may- have a violent attack of retching when he gets back to bed, and a piece of small intestine may be forced out by the side and produce a hernia. This actually occurred in a case of my own, where I had used stitches, the vomiting forcing out a couple of the stitches, and the small intestine coming through under the dressings. The house-surgeon thought it right to examine the parts after the retching was over, found what had happened, put the small intestine back, with two or three extra stitches, and no harm came of it. But in another case the acci- dent might not be found out directly. It was formerly the practice, and was usual when I did my first operations, to draw forward the parietal peritoneum, and attach it to the skin. Some one suggested that this was quite unnecessary, and the late Mr. Greig Smith, of Bristol, who was a great authority on these subjects, maintained that peritoneum and skin do perfectly well together, and that they unite without any trouble, and so it appears to be. The bowel, having been brought well out, is dusted with iodoform, and the dressing put upon it. It is well to leave it alone for four or five days if possible. I shall do the operation on Wednesday,- and shall probably open the bowel when I go round on Monday. If the patient were uncomfortable, I should open it

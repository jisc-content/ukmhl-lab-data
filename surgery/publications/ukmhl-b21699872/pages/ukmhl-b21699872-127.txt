TUBERCULAR JOINT-DISEASE I I I got steadily well, and now slie has a good stiff knee, and walks about perfectly well, and we see her from time to time. In the early stage of tubercular disease of the synovial membrane blisters, or better, the application of the Paquelin cautery, so as to produce free counter-irritation, is of great service, and may be followed by careful strapping and immobilisation of the joint. A method which promises well is the employ- ment of an iodoform emulsion, the anti- tubercular effect of which is well ascertained. A drachm of a 10 per cent, solution of iodoform in glycerine, with twice the quantity of water, is injected with a hypodermic syringe into the thickened synovial membrane at half a dozen places, and this is repeated at intervals of a couple of weeks, the knee being fixed on a splint. Careful massage may also be employed to remove the thickening of the tissues and to restore movement to the joint. ^ P.S.â€”The boy, the subject of this lecture, died three weeks after the amputation from progressive disease of the lungs and ex- haustion. The stump did not heal, but the flaps retracted and the end of the bone became exposed.

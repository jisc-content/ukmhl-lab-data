230 ON ANETJBYSM plastering it carefully with a series of layers, one upon the other, in order to strengthen the vessel. We find, on post-mortem examination, every now and then, a thickness of some inches even, and that what must have been a very dangerous condition, liable to interruption at any moment, has been tided over in that way, and the patients have thus lived for many years with a cured aneurysm. Therefore, I think we may take it, whatever the view held about the clot may be, that the physician or surgeon endeavours, as far as he can, to produce clot- ting in the cavity of the aneurysm,which, though soft at first, will gradually become more firm and laminated, and so cure the patient. From very early days, attempts have been made to cure aneurysm simply by general treatment, and I beheve myself that one very great element in the cure of an aneurysm is absolute rest. You must put your patient to bed, in a horizontal position, and you must keep him there for weeks, or even months, if you are to have anything approaching a cure. The fact of lying down and keeping absolutely at rest of course tends to equalise the circulation, to keep down the action of the heart, and bring the vessels into as quiet a condition as they can possibly be, so as to favour the deposit of clot in the aneur3^sm.

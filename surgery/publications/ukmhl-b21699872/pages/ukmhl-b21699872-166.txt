150 ON CASES OF EPITHELIOMA here. He lias got a warty growth of the eyehd which I have not interfered with. Below was a large protruding mass not unlike the drawing which I show you here from one of Hutchinson's plates. The protruding mass with an ulcerating centre I treated first by scraping and then by caustic paste; and as I said in the ward just now, I have not got rid of it all, but I shall scrape and caustic it agam. It is above the level of the mouth; there is no suspicion of glandular enlargement; it is evidently slow, for two years have elapsed since the original mjury, and I hope, therefore, for a permanent cure. You must bear in mind there are two distinct forms of this disease: there is the fungating rodent ulcer shown in this plate of Hutchinson's, and again there is the ordinary ulcerating form sometimes known as Jacob's ulcer, after the Dublin surgeon who first called attention to it. Placed side by side, you will see the difference in these plates. If you look at the clinical history, these cases are chronic and live for many years, though not usually getting quite well; whereas in true epithehoma two years see them out generally. The treatment, of course, is the same tor both diseasesâ€”cut it out if you possibly can, and where you cannot, scrape it thoroughly

TREATMENT OF ANEURYSM aneurysm, Avhere the carotid had ceased to beat, and was supposed (erroneously) to be obliterated. The patient (Mrs. Denmark) Avas greatly relieved, notwithstanding the fact that pulsation in the carotid recurred on the ninth day and persisted. She survived over two years. It is with this operation, in Avhich the open branches of the subclavian intervene between the hgature and the aneurysm, that Wardrop's name is usually connected, whereas Brasdor's name is applied to the ligature of the common carotid, where no branch intervenes. It is obvious, however, from Wardrop's own words,* that he regarded the obstruction of the carotid as an important preliminary to his proceeding, and later on (p. 87), he says, " it surely would be advisable to imitate Nature in this respect, and to place the final ligature on the carotid in preference to the subclavian. . . . When under these assumed circumstances the carotid has been tied, the propriety of afterwards placing a ligature on the subclavian must be decided by the effects produced on the aneurysm." Wardrop's proposal of tying the common carotid in cases of innominate aneurysm was adopted by several surgeons, with more or less success, but his suggestion of consecutive liga- ture of the third part of the subclavian was not followed till 1836-38 by Fearn, of Derby, whose * " On Anewysm," p. 61.

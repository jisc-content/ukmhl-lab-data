248 ON ANEURYSM the current beyond the sac does not necessarily prevent the blood getting into it; in fact, it rather tends to make the sac more full of blood and more tense. Nor do I beHeve, with Mr. Holmes, that the clotting begins at the seat of ligature and extends down into the sac. The only view I can put forward—and I quite allow it is only a tentative view—is, that the effect of the ligature is to alter the direction of the current of blood in the sac in some way. The blood does not go directly through the sac, as it used to do, but it comes into the sac and probably turns around the wall, and the consequence is that we have a deposit of fibrin taking place, and presumably a cure. I have repeated that operation on more than one case, with very satisfactory results. Unfortunately, in one case in which I tied the left carotid, we were not aware that the right carotid was also, to a certain extent, obstructed, and the result of tying the left carotid was to cut off the supply of blood from the brain to a greater extent than the brain would bear, and the patient died from the immediate effect of the ligature. But the other cases in which I tied the left carotid have been very satisfactory. Now, leaving the question of ligature alto- gether, just one word with regard to the pres- sure treatment.

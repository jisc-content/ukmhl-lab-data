126 ON A CASE OF FRACTURE OF close outside the foramen ovale, about three- quarters of an incli long, but it bad not torn the meningeal artery. The dura was then stripped off and the fracture examined ; it was found to extend from one side of the skull to the other, through the middle fossa. Beginning on the left side in the temporal region, it followed the line of the great wing of the sphenoid to the sphenoidal fissure, then across the body of the sphenoid at the sella turcica, this part bemg comminuted, to the right foramen ovale. In the middle fossa the lines of fracture diverged, one extending upwards to the right temporal region, and sending a branch forward along the great wing of the sphenoid, as on the left side, to the sphenoidal fissure; the second branch extended across the roof of the tym- panum almost as far as the lateral sinus, where it curved inwards to the jugular foramen. In the middle fossa the lines of fracture enclosed two large pieces of bone. The fracture of the petrous bone had lacerated the facial nerve, and opened up the internal ear. The mem- brana tympani, the malleus, and the incus were not damaged, but the stapes could not be found. These notes form the history of a typical case of fracture of the base of the skull follow- ing a violent fall. The question now arises, how did that man fall, and how was the injury

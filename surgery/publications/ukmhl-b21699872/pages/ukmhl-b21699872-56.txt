The advantage is that, without actually tearing the sphincter, it is paralysed for the time, and you are then enabled to draw the piles down ; another advantage is, that, the sphincter being paralysed for a day or two, the patient has none of that wearying, constant contraction of the anus which gives rise to so much pain, and which was always present in former years. The piles being protruded, there are half a dozen operations which you may use, and the one I generally employ in a well-marked case of piles is to apply a ligature. The modern operation of applying a ligature is very dif- ferent from the older one, when it was the custom to transfix the pile by a needle and tie it in two portions. The danger Avas that the needle which transfixed the pile very probably went through a vein also, and then when the vein Avas pulled wide open there was possibly suppuration, and the patient might get pycemia, from which some patients used to die; whereas such a thing is hardly ever heard of nowadays in connection with piles. Draw down the piles with ring-forceps or a pile-hook, such as I show you, then take a pair of scissors and cut between the skin and the mucous membrane (A, Fig. 5) so that you do not tie any skin in. That is very important, as the skin at the verge of the anus is very

But cases of this kind are few and far between, and in infants, at all events where the communication is, as in our patient, perfectly obvious (because when the child coughs the tumour swells and becomes tense), to interfere with it would certainly lead to the child's death. These cases are analogous to the deformity known as spina bifida. There is a want of development of the posterior part of the skull, similar to the want of development of the arches of the vertebra in spina bifida; but I there seems to be little doubt that the want of development depends not upon a simple arrest, but upon the fact that, very early in foetal life, hydrocephalus of the skull becomes de- veloped. It is the pressure of the fluid within : the brain and skull which prevents the due i development of the occipital bone. But, be i this as it may, the fact is undoubted that \ there is a hole in the median line of the occipital bone, through which the protrusion . takes place. In the patient before you there t can be no doubt of this, but in some of these » children, where the opening in the skull is i very near the foramen magnum, it becomes a i difficult question to decide whether it is an t instance of occipital meningocele, or an i example of spina bifida of the cervical I vertebrge, But let me remind you that spina»

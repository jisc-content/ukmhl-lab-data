310 THE HUNTERIAN ORATION a ligature above the aneurysm, and in close proximity to it, and only differed from his predecessors in not laying open the sac. It is well known that this method and its varieties proved so fatal from secondary haemorrhage that Pott, the leading authority of the day, recommended amputation as the only safe proceeding ; and on this Hunter remarks in his lectures, " When the disease is in an advanced stage I agree with Mr. Pott in thinking amputation necessary and preferable. The earlier, therefore, the operation for the aneurysm is performed the better, not waiting with the expectation that an increased size of the aneurysm will produce an increased size of the collateral branches. If the artery, however, cannot be tied above the aneurysm in the operation, where can it be tied if the limb be amputated ? Why not tie it tip higher in the sound parts where it is tied in amputation and preserve the limb ? " The first operation performed by Hunter for popliteal aneurysm, by ligature of the femoral artery in Hunter's canal, was in December 1785, the patient being a coachman aged forty-five. Sir Everard Home gives full details of the case in the London Medical Journal, vol. vii. 1786, and vol. viii. 1787, and also in the first volume of the " Transactions" of a Society for the Improvement of Medical and

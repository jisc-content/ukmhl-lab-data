36 ON COMMON DISEASES OF THE RECTUM First, then, regulate tlie patient's bowels, and get the liver to act. For this, a mild laxative is better than a powerful purgative, and there are several such laxatives; sulphur is a favourite one—a teaspoonful of milk of sulphur taken in a little milk every morning will give a healthy evacuation and very much relieve the patient. If that is not strong enough, you may use some other preparation, such as the compound liquorice powder—a teaspoonful or two stirred up in water and taken every night or the first thing in the morning. Cascara is one of the fashionable drugs of the present day, and a teaspoonful or two of the elixir of cascara will produce a fair evacuation. The objection to it is its exceedingly disagreeable taste. In addi- tion to such medicines, you can produce an evacuation, in people who are habitually costive, by injecting a little glycerine into the rectum. A few years ago this Avas a very fashionable proceeding, and all chemists sold little syringes for the purpose. A better plan is to use a suppository containing a drachm of glycerine, the suppository being allowed to melt in the bowel.

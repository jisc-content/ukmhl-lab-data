184 ON CASES OF THYROID CYST quently met with in young women soon after puberty, I have been very well satisfied with the daily use of the Linimentum Potassii lodidi c. Sapone, which has the great advantage of causing no damage to the skin or clothes of the patient. In cases of solid glandular tumour of the thyroid, enucleation is as satisfactory as in the case of cysts, and the extensive operations formerly undertaken for the removal of one or both halves of the gland are seldom called for. In the cases in which the thyroid exerts undue pressure upon the trachea, the division of the isthmus after the application of two ligatures, as originally proposed by Gibb, has proved very jeffectual in the hands of Sydney Jones and others. The most urgent and difficult cases are the somewhat rare examples of fibroid goitre in which the trachea is compressed laterally and flattened, so that the operation of tracheo- tomy, when called for in a sudden attack of dyspnoea, is most difficult of performance. I was greatly impressed by this, when a student, in the case of a woman who, admitted for dyspnoea, was foolishly allowed to walk upstairs to her ward. Here she fell down apparently dead, and the house-surgeon, hastily summoned, attempted to perform tracheotomy, but only inserted the tube into the cellular tissue of the neck, and produced subcutaneous emphysema

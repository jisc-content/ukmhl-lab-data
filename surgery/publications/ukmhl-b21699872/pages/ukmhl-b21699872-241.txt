ON ANEURYSM and are practically cured, and they are very puzzling- cases sometimes to the surgeon, who, for the first time, sees a patient with a tumour, and has a very obscure history as to the pre- vious condition of the case. I know of cases where amputation has been done for a tumour, and subsequently it has been found, upon dis- section, that that tumour was nothing more nor less than a cured aneurysm. There is pulsation, then, and that pulsation ceases immediately upon pressure over the mam artery. I think it is important to lay stress upon that, because it excludes those pulsating tumours of bone which are some- times exceedmgly difficult to diagnose. At the lower end of the femur it is not so very uncommon to get a pulsating sarcoma, which resembles in many respects pophteal aneurysm. But there is this great distinction: In the popliteal aneurysm, the moment you compress the femoral firmly over the pubes, the pulsa- tion in the aneurysm ceases, and then, with a very little gentle pressure upon the aneurysm, you can slightly diminish its size. Keeping your hand upon the aneurysm, and letting go the femoral artery, you then get immediately, by the first beat of the heart, a distension of the aneurysm to its full size, and, moreover, you notice that it has what we call a distensile pulsationâ€”that the aneurysm swells out in

300 A CENTURY OF SURGERY investigate the interior of the bLadder and urethra, and to diagnose diseases of the kidney by watching the discharge of pus from the orifice of a ureter. Lastly, let me mention the application of photography to the illumination of the deeper structures of the body. The Roentgen ra3^s, as they are called, are no doubt extremely valuable. They bring into relief parts which are hidden from view by the skin and soft tissues covering them. But I think a little caution will have to be used, because it is not every structure which shows up equally well under the Roentgen rays, and I am afraid, if we do not take care, that we shall get into difficulties over our fractures. I find, as a matter of fact, that the callus or new material which is thrown out in order to unite the fracture does not show at all under the Roentgen rays. You can see the outline of the fracture, and you can see the broken ends of the bone, and to the unlearned it looks as if the surgeon had made a hash of his business. We must take care that this is clearly under- stood, or we shall be liable to actions for malpraxis.

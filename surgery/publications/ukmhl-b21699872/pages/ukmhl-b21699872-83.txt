ON STRICTURE OF THE RECTUM 67 be able to detect the slightest deviation from health. You will find, in most cases of cancer, that somewhere just within reach of the finger there is a hard lump, perhaps on one side, possibly all round. Sometimes the lump is just out of reach of the finger; in such cases, by draw- ing gently upon the mucous membrane, you can bring it within reach. I advise you to get the patient to strain down, and a good plan is to give him an enema just before the examina- tion, then let him go to the closet and get down all he can, and you will find that he has brought the disease within reach of the finger. You will remember this particular patient told us that, when she went to the closet, she felt something in her bowel come down. If the stricture comes down close to the anus, one finds the condition which was at one time laid great stress on, but which is, in reality, quite unimportant â€” the occurrence of tape-like motions. If you make the diagnosis correctly, you must, of course, inform the patient or some friend what the probabihties are. I do not mean that you must tell a patient who has a lump in his rectum, or a slight ring, that he must have colotomy done; that would be ridiculous. But you must let somebody know that his health is not what it should "be, and that he will probably get worse. Meantime,

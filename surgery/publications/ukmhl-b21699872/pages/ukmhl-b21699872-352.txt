336 THE HUNTERIAN ORATION took place in 1870. After some years' expe- rience of these meetings and their methods, Erichscn came down to one of them, and made a strong protest against the chiims put forward on behalf of the Members of the College. This he subsequently expanded into a pamphlet entitled "The Member, the Fellow, and the Franchise " (Lewis, 1S86), which I commend to those who wish to read the case, stated temperately and clearly by one who thoroughly understood the subject. Erichsen Avas the recipient of numerous honours both at home and abroad. He was made a Fellow of the Royal Society somewhat late in life, was Surgeon Extraordinary to the Queen, and had been President of University College, London, since 1885. In 1895 he received a baronetcy, but as his wife, to whom he was devoted, had died previously, and he had no family, this was somewhat of a barren honour. Those who had the pleasure of Sir John Erichsen's acquaintance will agree with me in regarding him not merely as a leading surgeon of the nineteenth century, but also as an amiable, courteous gentleman, whom to know was to love. Sir George Murray Humrpliry, who died the day after Sir John Erichsen, had for many years occupied the unique position of repre- senting an ancient University rclms in onedicis.

CASE OF WILLIAM COLLINS. 33 removed, the discoloured integument resumed its natural charac- ter, and in about a fortnight the loose portion of bone had en- tirely disappeared. CASE XI. WILLIAM COLLINS, gimlet-maker, set. 34, was admitted February 11, 4^ a.m., 1844, with oblique fracture of the ulna, under the care of Mr. Sands Cox. Patient’s Statement.—Feb. 11.—He came to the Hospital in a state of intoxication about half-past four in the morning, stat- ing that he had “just received a blow on the left arm from a poker. The blow was directed to his head, but he raised his arm to save it.” Appearances and Symptoms.—The left forearm was supported by the right hand. There is considerable increase of the posterior diameter of the forearm, at the junction of the middle and lower thirds; the motions of the forearm are much restricted and productive of great pain; the ulnar border of the forearm is depressed in its lower third. The radius could be traced unbroken throughout; but on following upwards the course of the ulna, its inferior third was found considerably drawn outwards towards the radius. At the junction of the upper and middle third, was felt a sharp prominence, caused by the projection of the shaft of the bone, or rather of its superior fractured extre- mity. This readily yielded to pressure. By fixing the arm below the elbow, and rotating it at the same time, a crepitus was very distinctly felt. Treatment.—The forearm being placed su- pine and fixed at the elbow, extension was made at the hand, which was at the same time abducted, to separate the inferior portion of the ulna from the radius ; the displaced flexors and extensors were then returned to their na- tural locality, and to secure them, a com- press of lint was placed over the inter-osseous spaces, on the dor- sal and palmer aspect of the forearm. Over these an anterior and posterior splint were firmly bandaged, and the forearm was supported in a sling.

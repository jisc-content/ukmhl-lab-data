38 CASES OF SARAH BROOKS AND JOHN BLUNT. CASE XLV. SARAH BROOKS, set. 70, Dudley-street, alms houses, was admitted September 28, 1844, with fractured radius, under the care of Mr. Sands Cox. Cause of Accident.—The jmtient, who, about eighteen months since, had the neck of the thigh hone broken by a fall, was brought to the Hospital at 7 p.m., having been, about an hour before, thrown down by a hoy running against her; and her weight fell on the left hand, which she extended to break her fall. Appearance of the Limb.—The left hand is supine; about an inch above the wrist there is a considerable prominence on the radial side of the forearm anteriorly; this is found to depend upon the shaft of the radius being drawn inwards by the action of the pronator teres and the pronator quaclratus. The distal ex- tremity of the radius is broken off transversely, on a level with the base of the styloid process; the separated portion of bone can be readily moved in any direction; the ulna is perfect. Treatment.—A pad of lint was placed over the inter-osseous space anteriorly, and an anterior and posterior splint, extending to the fingers, was bandaged to the forearm; the arm was afterwards placed in a sling, in a state midway between pronation and supi- nation. The patient has been discharged, cured. —♦— CASE XV. JOHN BLUNT, set. 12, nail-cutter, Suffolk-street, was admit- ted February 14, 1844, with laceration of the iris, under the care of Mr. Sands Cox. Patient’s Statement.—Feb. 14.—He was brought to the Hospital at 6 p.m. He stated that he had just been struck on the eye by a stone, of about half a pound in weight, thrown at him by another lad. Appearances and Symptoms.—The upper and lower lids of the left eye were much swollen and closed; yielding, when pressed with the finger, a crackling sound. They could not be sufficiently separated to afford a view of the eye, or any portion of it; but

CASE OF NICHOLAS REEVES. 55 Appearances of Limb.—There is extensive oedema of the foot and leg below the instrument, which tightly embraces the limb ; the knee joint appears flattened anteriorly; while commencing above the condyles of the femur, and extending upwards in the course of the rectus, the integuments appear raised and tense. On ma- nual examination, the patella was found wanting in its natural situation, its situation being partially filled up by a soft elastic mass, which is probably the bursa mucosa, which is naturally co- vered by it, abnormarly enlarged. The patella may be felt lying upon the femur above its condyles, and allows of a trifling degree of lateral motion; above this, the rectus muscle is felt tense and somewhat raised, so that the integuments may be, as it were, pushed beneath it; and the irregular margin of the ruptured liga- mentum patella may be distinctly felt upon the tuberosity of the tibia. Treatment.—The patient was directed to leave off the instru- ment and to keep the limb raised and in a quiescent state. On the Monday following he was visited at his own house, and the oedematous condition of the leg and foot was found to have dis- appeared. The leg being extended, and the body brought forwards in a sitting posture, in such a manner as to relax the rectus muscle, the patella was readily carried downwards by the fingers over the condyles of the femur, almost into its natural situation; but the part of the ligamentum patella attached to the patella could not be brought into imme- diate apposition with the inferior fixed portion, a space of rather more than half an inch intervening between the two, into which the enlarged bursa protruded. A bandage was now applied from the foot to the knee, and the thigh bandaged from above downwards. The simple bandage not being found adequate to prevent displacement of the patella by the con- traction of the rectus, a starched ban- dage, applied in the same manner, was had recourse to, and by this means the patella was maintained in its natural position ; but owing to the protrusion of the enlarged bursa, the ruptured ends could not be brought into immediate ap- position ; and although this treatment, combined with a raised posture of the limb, was persevered in until the com- mencement of June, no permanent good

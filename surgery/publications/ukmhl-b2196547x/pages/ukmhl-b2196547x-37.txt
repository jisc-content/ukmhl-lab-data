35 CASES OF BENJ. CARPENTER AND THOS. DAWES. Distortion, caused by the Patient’s Imprudence.—The imprudence of the patient, who worked at his trade, (that of a black- smith,) contrary to orders, before the recently formed ossific mat- ter was sufficiently hardened, subjected him to deformity; but this was in a great degree remedied by again having recourse to splints, and was, most probably, entirely removed; as the patient only attended the Hospital once after their reapplication. —♦— CASE XII. BENJAMIN CARPENTER, set. 53, pensioner, admitted May 4th, 1844, with fractured tibia and fibula, under the care of Mr. Sands Cox. Site of fracture unusual. Cause of Accident.—He was admitted at 10 o’clock p.m., ha- ving fallen down stairs about an hour before, whilst in a state of intoxication, his right leg being at the time bent inwards. Appearance of Limb.—The upper part of the right leg was much deformed, there being a considerable prominence on its outer, and depression on its inner side. The foot was thrown inwards. Nature of Fracture.—The tibia was found to be fractured transversely through its tubercle, the upper part of its shaft being thrown outwards, on a line with the outer margin of the patella; and the fibula was broken transversely below its head, opposite to the site of the fracture of the tibia. Cure.—The limb was extended, and so retained by means of a posterior and two lateral splints, secured by bandages. The case progressed favorably, and the patient was discharged, cured, on July 5th. The motion of the joint is not perfect, but improves daily. CASE XIII. THOMAS DAWES, set. 8, Suffolk-street, admitted Dec. 29th, 1843, with club foot, under the care of Mr. Sands Cox. Operation of the division of the “ tendo-Achillis.” History of Case.—His mother states that when he was first put to walk, she observed a weakness of his left leg, and that this lias increased gradually to the present time. He walks now with difficulty, and is frequently compelled to rest.

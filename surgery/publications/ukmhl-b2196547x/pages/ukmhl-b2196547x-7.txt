PRIZE SURGICAL CLINICAL REPORTS, &C. &C. CASE I. ELIZABETH D., Hill Top, eet. 49, the mother of seven chil- dren, housewife; was admitted into Adelaide Ward 2, October 26, 1843, under the care of Mr. Sands Cox. History of the Case.—Oct. 26.—She states that she has suf- fered from hemorrhage from the vagina for the last twelve months; that it has, during this time, been nearly constant and gradually increasing in severity; and that the blood discharged comes away “in clutters;” no white shreds are ever perceptibly mixed with it; she considers that the hemorrhage has been greater than usual at the menstrual periods.

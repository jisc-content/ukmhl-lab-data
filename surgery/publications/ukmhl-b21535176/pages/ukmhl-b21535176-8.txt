INTRODUCTION. The Synopsis is intended to exhibit at one view, not only the whole of the Admissions during Twenty-two Years, but the most prevailing Dis- eases amongst the labouring poor in this popu- lous town and neighbourhood. It will also shew the nature and number of Accidents that have been admitted at any hour in the night or day, without any recommendation ; and likewise it will shew the ratio of Medical and Surgical Cases. There is also appended to the Synopsis, ex- planatory Notes, taken chiefly from the Writerâ€™s own observations in practice.

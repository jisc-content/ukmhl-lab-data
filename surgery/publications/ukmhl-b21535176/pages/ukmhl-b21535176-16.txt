OBSERVATIONS. 14 ed into a Tumour, weighing eight pounds, partly Scirrhus, partly Apostemous; the consequences of which, more or less remote, were an adhesion of the convex side of the liver to the peritonaeum ; an adhesion to that part of the lesser intestine near the Tumour to the peritonaeum, and the surface of the peritonaeum itself, to be covered with the co- agulable part of the pus, where it touched the Tumour. The total quantity of water taken from this patient amounted to 1414 pints, ~ 8 = 176 gallons 6 pints. Many other remarks might be brought forward upon other interesting cases ; but this being quite unnecessary on the present occasion, the writer here concludes what he intended to present to his medical friends.

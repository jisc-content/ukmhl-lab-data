TREATMENT OF URETHRAL STRICTURE. 1309 rectum, we can feel that the narrow part of the staff only has passed, and that the thick portion is still arrested in the perineum. With these precautions, and using great gentleness in passing the instrument, I consider this method of diagnosis affords us absolute certainty as to the existence and site of an organic stricture. I now proceed to speak of the treatment of stricture, and we must consider this under two aspects. First, the treatment when the emergency of retention of urine has occurred in consequence of organic stricture; secondly, the different methods employed for the radical cure of the disease, or the treatment of stricture pro- perly so called. There are few emergencies in surgery attended with more urgent symptoms, or requiring greater skill, experience, and determination, tempered with gentleness in manipulation, than retention of urine arising from tight organic stricture; and whilst I may be able to give you some hints for your guidance, founded on a considerable experience in such cases, I feel at the same time, that this is one of those subjects where many im- portant advantages of experience are not communicable, but must be attained by each one for himself To begin,â€”In dealing with cases of retention from organic stricture, I would advise you to hold as an axiom, that, wherever the patient has, up to the time of the attack, been able to pass water by the urethra, in however slender a stream, there must be a passage along which you should be able to pass an instrument into the bladder.

LECTURE CXXIII. Symptoms of Urethral Stricture—Secondary eflfects on the Digestive Functions and on the Nervous centres—Positive Diagnosis of Organic Stricture—Treat- ment of Retention of Urine, arising from Tight Stricture—Curative Treatment by Vital Dilatation—Diipuytren's plan of Vital Dilatation. A CONSIDERATION of the various morbid conditions which I have mentioned will show you that in the diagnosis and treatment of stricture of the urethra we have generally to deal with more than the mere local alteration, and it should also impress you with the necessity for careful examination into the state of the different organs likely to be affected, as modifying the plan of local treat- ment which we may employ ; and, besides these more direct com- plications, we have the less direct effect of the disease on the digestive organs and nervous system, which require our most serious attention. The causes of urethral stricture are various—injuries of the urethra and perineum; inflammation of the canal, produced by any cause; ulceration from applications of caustics to the urethra. By far the most common cause, however, is the peculiar form of venereal inflammation, gonorrhoea, and the succeeding gleet. I should say that about 96 out every 100 cases are due to gonorrhoea and its results. The symptoms of urethral stricture, depending on the local condition, are gradual diminution of the stream of urine, tiU at last it comes only drop, by drop, or ends in complete reten- tion. The diminution in the size of the stream, however, is so very gradual, that the patient does not at first notice it, and insensibly gets accustomed to this state of matters, until his attention is attracted to it by some other circumstance, such as the length of time he requires to empty the bladder, and the straining which is necessary to effect the emission of the urine.

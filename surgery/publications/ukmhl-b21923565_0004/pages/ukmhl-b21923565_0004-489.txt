PREFACE. ix Dr. John Smith. And here I would draw attention to the mode of illustration adopted, as preferable to the ordinary woodcuts, both in respect to the perspicuity afforded by colour, as well as enabling me to give faithful transcripts from photographs, or from original sketches made by various artistic friends, of actual cases or dissections, and used by me as class illustrations in my Lectures at the University. A'pril 1871.

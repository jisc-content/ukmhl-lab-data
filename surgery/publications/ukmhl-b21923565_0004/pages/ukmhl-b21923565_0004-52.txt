Diphtheritic Crouj) : its nature as compared with Simple Croup—Duration of Disease and modes of Death, illustrated by Examples — Complications arising from previous Disease and present Contingencies—Indications for performing the Operation of Tracheotomy, and Cases best suited for it— Contra-indications—The stage of the Disease when it is most likely to be successful—Local and Constitutional After-treatment. Another form of laryngeal disease whicli we must notice is Diphtheritic Croup. Though experience has shown such an amount of success after the performance of tracheotomy in ordinary croup as to warrant the operation, it does not follow that in diphtheritic affections of the air-passages it would be equally warrantable. A priori reasoning, indeed, would almost lead to the conclusion that it is scarcely warrantable at all. All the circumstances seem unfavourable. Not only have we an equal, or even greater, tendency in the diphtheritic exudation to spread down- wards, than we have in the case of the false membrane of croup, but the disease may even affect the wound caused by the opera- tion. Moreover, it is a blood-disease of a very subtle nature, and of a most debilitating character, affecting the nervous system peculiarly, and destroying its victims by exhaustion, even when there is no laryngeal or tracheal obstruction. Yet, so far as my own experience goes, the actual results of tracheotomy in diph- theritic croup show such an amount of success, as in the other- wise desperate state of the patient fully warrants its performance. I have now performed tracheotomy about forty times in diph- theritic croup, and the results are rather more than one in three saved, which is slightly, more favourable than in simple croup. Still I do not think that these are such favourable cases for the operation as those of simple croup.

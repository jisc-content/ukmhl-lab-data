Inflammation of the mucous lining of the urethra, attended with pain and irritation of the parts, and pain during micturition, accompanied by the discharge of viscid muco-purulent matter, may arise from various causes not venereal, such as direct local irritation, or from affections of other organs leading indirectly to irritation of the mucous membrane, constituting Urethritis or GoNORRHCEA SIMPLEX. The term gonorrhoea was originally applied to all urethral discharges, under the idea that the irritation led to over-secretion and discharge of altered seminal fluid ; and although this erroneous notion has long ago been exploded, the term from custom is still retained. The form of urethritis which we have to treat most fre- quently is an inflammation of a specific character, arising from the application of a virus to the mucous surface, and hence it is termed Gonorrhcea Virulenta, not on account of the virulence of the symptoms, but to distinguish it from the simple form, as arising from a special virus, and by the poison-power the dis- charge possesses of communicating a similar disease when ap- plied to a mucous surface. At one time gonorrhoea and syphilitic affections were all in- cluded under the one head of venereal diseases, a nosological arrangement which led to lamentable results in practice, from the treatment adopted, in consequence of the idea that these dis-

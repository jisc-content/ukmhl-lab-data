1163 CAUSES OF DEATH IN HERNIA. distinctly gangrenous, and therefore, though the operation was the only chance of saving the patient's life, the state of the intes- tine was such that a favourable result could hardly be expected. In 7 cases, peritonitis had commenced before the operation ; and of these, 4 were cases of congenital hernia, where peritonitis occurs rapidly. In one case, pyaemia proved fatal on the eighth day, but this case was a very complicated one. In one recent case, a fatal result occurred : here the operation was extra-peri- toneal, and the hernia was very large and bulky, and had come down rather rapidly, while the patient was at his work. The man made violent efforts at the time to reduce the hernia, while afterwards attempts were also made, but without success. In this case, the hernia had only been down for twelve hours. When I operated, I divided the integument and the fascia down to the deep ring, and then, by dividing the textures external to the neck of the sac, I was able to reduce the hernia with great ease. After a time, the patient began to pass bloody stools, showing that haemorrhage from the interior of the gut had taken place, evidently in consequence of the efforts the man had made to reduce the hernia at first. I believe, that if cold had been ap- plied to the tumour, and the taxis properly employed at first, the hernia might have been reduced without any operation. The real cause of the fatal result was evidently the mischief pro- duced by the violent and ill-directed efforts made by the patient to reduce the hernia, when it came down. 4 G

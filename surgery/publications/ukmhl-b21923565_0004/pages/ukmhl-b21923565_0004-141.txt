Such a case is an extreme one, but the same condition may occur more slowly, and to a less extent, giving rise to serious danger. The same principles of treatment are required in either case. It is sometimes recom- mended, in incipient stages of emphysema, to bandage the patient so as to prevent the air from spreading all over the body; but if the air does not get to the cellular tissue, it accu- mulates in the pleura, and the more dangerous condition of pneumothorax will occur. It is therefore better to allow the cellular tissu.e to get distended, than to run the risk of letting the air collect in the pleura. The Treatment of emphysema, when there is no external wound, is to refrain from bandaging at first. We always have more or less pneumothorax present, and the lung is partially collapsed. But such collapse is rather beneficial, for it allows the injured lung to rest; the circulation through it is diminished; the woiind, if small, is glazed over by plastic exudation, and the further escape of air is prevented. In cases of slight em- physema, little or no treatment is necessary beyond that required for the fractured rib. In other cases, when the emphysema is extending, and where respiration is affected, we make small incisions through the skin wherever the air is collected in the cellular tissue. Several of these are made over the whole body, and through them the air escapes very readily. The tension, pressure, and difficulty of breathing, become less, and the air in the pleura also becomes

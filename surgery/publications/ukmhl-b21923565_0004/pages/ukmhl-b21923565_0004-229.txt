Femoral Hernia can protrude only at one part of the abdomen. On looking at the interior of the pelvis and abdomen when the peritoneum has been stripped off, we notice that the fascia iliaca, as it passes down, is perfectly continuous on the outer side of the iliac vessels with the layer of fascia passing up to line the posterior abdominal parietes. In fact, there is no break in the continuity of these two fasciae from the superior anterior spine of the ilium to the outer side of the femoral sheath, so that in this space no hernia can protrude. When the fasciae arrive at the vessels, they arrange themselves into a funnel-shaped sheath to admit of the passage of the great vessels into the thigh. That layer of these fasciae corresponding to the posterior aspect of the transversalis muscle passes down in front of the vessels, and can be traced continuously with the deep portion of the fascia lata, while the fascia iliaca, which passes behind the vessels, sweeps down posteriorly, or on a deeper plane, and corresponds to the pubic or internal portion of the fascia lata of the thigh. Wliere the vessels pass out, whilst there is a separa- tion of these layers of fasciae, they send down a septum between the vein and the artery. Besides this fascial funnel the vessels have also their distinct and proper cellular sheath, and this pre- vents any protrusion descending between the vein and the artery. But between the iliac vein and the pubes we have a space almost

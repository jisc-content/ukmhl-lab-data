1370 REGIONAL SURGERY. or diminisli haemorrliage during tlie section, the method usually- adopted, is to suspend the tumour above the height of the body for some time before the oper- ation, so as to empty the large veins, and then the direct con- trol of the hemorrhage during the operation is best effected by the plan recommended by Professor Fayrer of Calcuttaâ€” namely, to carry a stout cord round the neck of the mass, and both ends having been passed through a strong steel ring, about the size of a small curtain ring, strangulation of the pedicle is effected by two assistants drawing on the ends of the cord in opposite direc- tions. Or a large stout needle in a fixed handle, and blunt except at the point, and with an eye near the point of suf- ficient size to admit a strong whip-cord, may be thrust through the narrowest part or neck of the tumour. The cord is thus carried through, the loop divided, and each half used to strangulate firmly one division of the neck of the growth, which is then cut off by the amputating knife. When the mass is removed, the open mouths of the vessels in the pedicle may either be secured separately, and the compressing cord removed, or if there be only slight oozing from the pedicle, the cords may be tied firmly and allowed to remain as ligatures. In cases where the tumour of the scrotum is of moderate size, and the integuments sufficiently soft to enable us to recognise the position of the testicle and penis; by careful dis- section at the upper part of the swelling, we may clear and isolate these organs so as to save them and a portion of integument, but

The Injuries and Diseases of the Pharynx form a depart- ment of practical surgery wliich is well worthy of your earnest attention. I will therefore treat the subject in the manner which I think most likely to commend it to your understandings, and impress it on your memories—namely, by drawing largely from my personal experience for the illustration of the principles of treatment I advise. Injuries of the Pharynx are generally caused by the en- trance and impaction of foreign bodies which have been arrested in the act of being swallowed. These consist of pieces of food, fish-bones, pins, coins, false teeth, and like substances. Such accidents necessarily require immediate attention and great care, both in immediate treatment and after-treatment. When small bodies, such as pins or fish-bones, get entangled in the pharynx, they generally lodge behind the tonsil or beside the hyoid bone, where they are, as a rule, within reach of the finger. In searching for them, we should pass our finger back- wards along one side of the mouth, upwards and downwards between the pillars of the fauces, around the region of the hyoid bone, in front of the epiglottis and base of the tongue; then withdraw the finger, and, in doing so, make a similar search on the opposite side. A sharp body is most frequently impacted between the pillars of the fauces, where it can be easily recog- nised and dislodged by the point or nail of the finger ; but it may be in a position lower down, and still within reach of the finger, although it cannot be extracted by it. In such cases the

1033 DIPHTHERITIC CROUP. to it after tracheotomy wlien we see the fluid ejected, the question comes,—Is it not probable that the same paralysed state of the glottis may allow portions of fluid nutriment to pass into the air- passages in other cases of diphtheria in which tracheotomy has not been performed ? I would now, in conclusion, state my inrpressious as to tlie propriety of performing tracheotomy in certain cases of dipli- theria, or of refraining from its performance in others, derived from what I have observed in cases in my own practice. First, then, the great and positive indication for operation is the immediate urgency of the suffocative laryngeal symptoms. "When these are intense, and the contracted state of the thoracic parietes shows that little air is entering the chest, the operation is warranted, as affording the only chance of obviating impend- ing death from asphyxia; and this, the only chance, may be given, however unfavourable the prognosis as to ultimate success. The results of the successful cases point to the fact that the more favourable cases for operation are those in which the laryngeal symptoms have commenced early and progressed rapidly, with, perhaps, decided local diphtheritic symptoms, but the febrile or constitutional symptoms less promine-nt;—where, in fact, there is least intensity of the constitutional poison, and where the very acuteness of the local symptoms indicates a certain amount of power. The cases less suited for operation are those in which the con- stitutional morbid conditions have existed in a marked form, together with fever, quick and weak pulse, for some time before the exudation affected the air-passagee, and in which the croupous dyspnoea is not very intense. Occasional paroxysms of convulsive cough occurring in such cases, and relieved by the ejection of mucus and false membrane, unless increasing in frequency, do not warrant the operation. Nor is it warranted in cases where, to speak generally, the colour of the face and lips, and the state of the chest, show no continued obstacle to respira- tion. Cases in which the diphtheritic affection has supervened on scarlatina, measles, or gastric fever, or in which there is marked

REGIONAL SURGERY. 1072 I felt warranted to operate, on the following grounds :—First, as I have already said, the simple character of the tumour made me feel secure that, though it might displace, press upon, or even adhere to the sheath of the great vessels and nerves, it would not absolutely involve them. Secondly, the absence of any en- gorgement of the great veins of the neck on either side, or of any marked alteration in the arterial supply of the right side of the face, made me pretty sure that neither the internal jugular nor the carotid could be very closely or extensively involved; whilst the functions of respiration and deglutition being unim- paired, and no symptom of laryngeal irritation existing, rendered it equally clear that neither the vagus nerve, its branches, nor the phrenic, were as yet implicated. Having thus satisfied myself that the tumour might be re- moved by an operation properly planned, and carefully and deliberately executed, I proceeded to determine the method by which it could be most readily and safely accomplished. The dangers to be apprehended were—Hsemorrhage from the arteries supplying the tumour, or, more likely, from the great veins re- turning the blood from it ; the risk of air entering any of these large veins when divided ; the risk of injury to the vagus or phrenic nerves ; and the probability of meeting difficulty from adhesion of parts in the parotid region, where tlae tumour felt fixed ; lastly, exhaustion of the patient from the necessarily tedious dissection and large exposed surface. To obviate these dangers as far as possible, I determined to expose freely the whole surface of the tumour ; to clear its edges ; and, in doing this, to expose the anterior margin of the sterno-mastoid muscle, at the lower part of neck, so as to be able, if necessary, to com- press the carotid ; next, to divide the sterno-mastoid above and below, so as to leave the part adherent to the growth ; to tie the external jugular with two ligatures, and divide it between them ; and to pursue the same course in regard to all the larger veins passing towards the jugular or root of the neck, and to secure the larger arterial branches as divided.

REGIONAL SURGERY. 1344 eases were identical in nature. In the present day, and indeed for a long period back, I believe that no one holds or has held such a view. Some, however, have gone to the opposite ex- treme, and consider that there is no evidence of specific cha- racter in gonorrhoea: that the disease is simply to be regarded as discharge arising from inflammatory action, and possessing the same characters whether the inflammation be excited by some accidental local irritant or by impure sexual contact. Whilst I readily admit that any acrid discharge or other irritant of a non-venereal character applied to the urethra may excite all the acute symptoms of the inflammation and the purulent dis- charge, yet such an irritant will never produce certain specific symptoms which we meet with in many cases of gonorrhoea virulenta, and which are liable to occur in all, if proper treat- ment be not adopted. I allude especially to the peculiar lichenous eruption, and the acute or subacute forms of articular rheumatism, which frequently supervene during the retrocedent stage of the affection, and the gonorrhoeal, ophthalmia and otorrhcea, which occur when the discharge has ceased, or been suddenly arrested, and which cannot be accounted for on the supposition of direct application of the discharge to the part. Such constitutional affections never follow on simple urethritis, and the period at which and the manner in which they occur seem to me distinctly to indicate the specific character of gonor- rhoea virulenta. One reason why I have drawn your attention to this character of the disease is, that in gonorrhoea, as in most diseases arising from a specific virus or infection, we have it run- ning its peculiar course, and undergoing a series of natural changes, the observation of which may form indications for, or modify its treatment. Thus, from the period of accession, we find a gradual increase in the violence of the symptoms up to the eighth or tenth day, when it culminates; and from that period the violence of the pain and amount of the discharge diminish, and the character of the discharge alters. During the retrogres- sive stage, affections of some of the other organs connected with

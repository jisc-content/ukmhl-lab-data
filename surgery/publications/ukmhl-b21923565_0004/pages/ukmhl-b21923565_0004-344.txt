REGIONAL SURGERY. 1304 into the urethra, behind the contracted part, and to burst exter- nally ; then, owing to the urine finding more easy vent through the adventitious opening than through the contracted urethra, a fistula in perineo results. When this condition occurs, fresh ab- scesses form from time to time, and new fistulous openings, through which the urine dribbles off. In many instances we find four or five such apertures, some opening on the scrotum, others in the perineum, and others towards the hips. There is great sur- rounding consolidation of the perineum, and when the patient makes water, a small stream is ejected through each aperture, and very little passes through the urethra. On examination of such a case after death, we almost invariably find that, however numerous and however distant the external apertures of the fistulse may be, they all converge to a common fistulous canal, communicating with the urethra behind the stricture. In old cases these fistulous tracks are lined by a smooth structure, re- sembling mucous membrane ; and where no proper means have been used, the contracted part of the urethra may have become absolutely impermeable from disuse.

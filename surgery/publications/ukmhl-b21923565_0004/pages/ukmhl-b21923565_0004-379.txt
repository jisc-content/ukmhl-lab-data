1337 FISTULA IN PERINEO. consolidated the tissues and formed the cyst of the abscess, and hence the fluid is not largely extravasated as in the ordinary form of infiltration of urine. Unless, however, free vent be given to the collection, the barrier soon yields before the pres- sure and destructive action of the acrid fluid, and then the fluid contents gradually infiltrate the surrounding parts, and lead to sloughing and unhealthy suppuration, undermining and de- stroying the deep as well as the superficial structures, and ultimately, though more slowly, the fatal results follow as in the former case, or the patient may die with the symptoms of a com- bination of pysemia and uraemia. The pathological condition indicates the proper treatment, namely, early incision in all cases of suspected suppuration in the perineum, without waiting for fluctuation. When the symptoms of deep inflammation in the perineum have been followed by escape of pus by the urethra, without much diminution of the perineal swelling, and with per- haps increased local and constitutional irritation, no time should be lost in making a deep incision into the perineum to afford vent to the confined fluids, and so prevent mischief Should the urine have made its way through the consolidated tissue form- ing the boundary cyst of the abscess, and become infiltrated, we must make incisions over its course, and apply poultices and fomentations, as in the usual form of extravasation of urine, to allay irritation and favour the escape of sloughs of dead tissue, whilst at the same time we support the patient's strength by stimulants and nutrient diet. When speaking of the various pathological conditions arising in consequence of i^rethral stricture and complicating the treat- ment, I mentioned Fistula in Peeineo, and stated how it origi- nated in abscess, and was kept up by the urine passing through the fistulous track so long as the contraction remained in front. Wlien this condition has continued for some time, the sinuses and the main fistulous canal connected with the opening in the urethra behind the stricture become much consolidated; and lined with a structure resembling mucous membrane.

REGIONAL SURGERY. 1228 become impacted in the canal, and give rise to much trouble, or even danger. It is obvious, therefore, that lithotrity is not an operation suitable for boys, for in them the urethra is neither large enough to allow of the passage of a full-sized instrument, nor to allow the larger broken fragments to come away readily with the urine ; besides, in children, the bladder is generally very irritable in cases of stone. In children, moreover, the lateral operation of lithotomy is almost unattended with danger, while the irritation caused by the use of the lithotrite is very great. I consider that lithotrity ought, therefore, never to be performed in children. When the prostate is enlarged and dense, as in old people, lithotomy is not so favourable, for in such cases we require to cut very freely, and split up the resistant gland; and though there is little risk of infiltration of urine, and the operation itself is easy enough, and though the patient goes on very well for some time, even for weeks after the operation, yet we sometimes find that at a later period gastric and hepatic irritation set in, dysentery comes on, and the patient ultimately sinks. The wound itself may have healed, but it is the effect of the operation that has killed the patient; and therefore in this class of cases I prefer lithotrity if the stone be small and easily broken, and if the prostate be not of such a form as to present a valvular obstruction to the passage of the fragments of the stone. In these cases we can introduce a full-sized instrument, and by proper medical treatment get over the irritable state of the bladder, and thus there is every chance of a successful result after lithotrity, more especially as the calculi are generally phosphatic. In the female we do not often require to operate for stone, because, from the shortness and straight course of the female urethra, calculi readily pass out of the bladder by the urethra if they are of a moderate size, and hence they do not often attain any great size in the female ; but, when they do, they give rise to intense suffering, and require some operation for their removal. If we perform lithotomy in these cases, or instead of this use me- chanical dilatation, such as the sponge or tangle tent, or special

1173 TREATMENT OF ARTIFICIAL ANUS. from the effusion of lymph and the healing process, we find that the two parallel portions of the bowel gradually tend to ap- proach each other, and come to na angle as it were ; the orifices thus approach nearer the axis of the line of the gut, and what the surgeon has to do is to take advantage of this natural process, and assist it to a certain extent. After a time, as I have said, the portions of bowel tend to become more in a line, but still the passage of fseces prevents closure of the intestine, and the septum will continue to act as a valve, and a fseculent fistvda will be established. Sometimes nature will cure the fistula, but the surgeon occasionally requires to use compressing forceps to efiace the septum and establish the continuity of the canal of the bowel. The blades of the forceps are introduced separately into the two portions of the bowel, and they are very gradually closed upon the projecting septum, so as to compress it. If this be done too tightly at first, violent irritation may follow, and hence great care is required in watch- ing the patient after the first application of the forceps. They are kept on for some time, and gradually the valvular projection of the septum is effaced, and the continuity of the bowel is re- established ; the fajces pass along the track of the bowel, and the natural channel is restored, while the fistula gradually heals. In less extensive gangrene of the bowel, treated by the method I recommended when speaking of the slightly gangrenous or doubtful state of the gut, when a fistula does take place we do not require this treatment, for in such cases there is only one opening ; the continuity of the bowel is complete from the first; the parts become adherent to the integument, and the opening contracts and heals up.

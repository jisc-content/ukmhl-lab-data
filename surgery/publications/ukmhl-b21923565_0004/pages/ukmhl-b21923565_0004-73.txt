1047 TRACHEOTOMY. and by passing a featlier down the tracliea, sprinkling cold water on the face, and performing artificial respiration, I have succeeded in restoring animation; but, except in such cases, there should be no great haste. In performing tracheotomy in the adult, whilst the general steps of the operation are the same, and whilst it is easier of execution in most cases, yet in some respects it presents diffi- culties peculiar to adult life. In children, the space in which we have to make our incisions is absolutely smaller than in the adult, but, relatively, the space is greater between the isthmus of the thyroid gland and the top of the sternum. The space occupied by the larynx and hyoid bone is small, and the cervical portion of the trachea is longer than in the adult. The development of the larynx in the adult alters the relation of parts ;â€”the space between the chin and the lower margin of the cricoid cartilage is increased, whilst the space between the cricoid cartilage and sternum has diminished. The trachea is thus shorter, and not only so, but in proportion to the projec- tion of the larynx and development of the thyroid gland, the trachea descends obliquely backwards from the surface, and its depth a little above the sternum is very considerably increased. In the male, when the neck is short and muscular, the muscles tense, and the trachea working violently up and down as in threatened asphyxia, the difficulties of the operation are very great. In some cases on which I have operated, I have found the trachea situated at a great depth from the surface, and so short a space between the thyroid isthmus and sternum, as not only rendered the operation difficult, but when completed, the orifice of the tracheotomy tube was almost draAvn under the sternum, and I have occasionally been obliged to fix and draw the trachea upwards by means of a sharp hook, till the convulsive movements diminished. As the diseases which require the operation in adults, have little or no tendency to spread downwards, I think that in them the opening in the trachea may often be made with advantage

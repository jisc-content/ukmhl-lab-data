DANGERS OF CONGENITAL HERNIA. 1193 The reason wliy I draw your special attention to congenital inguinal hernia is, that it requires to be, if possible, more promptly attended to than any other form. The state of the parts and the degree of constriction are such, that bad consequences very soon follow any attempts at reduction, unless they succeed. In many instances, continued attempts at reduction do much harm. As regards the operation in congenital hernia, the extra- peritoneal operation is not suitable, as the neck of the sac, or the narrow portion of the canal, forms the constriction; and therefore, when operating on the adult, we must open the sac in all cases, to divide the stricture. As regards the peculiar dangers of strangulated congenital hernia.â€”Any one who has carefully noticed the results of such cases must have been struck with the greater fatality in them than in other forms of rupture ; whilst those who have had much experience in operating can scarcely have failed to be surprised at the amount of morbid action which is often pre- sented in the contents of such a hernia in a very short period of time, compared with what we find even in cases of femoral or umbilical herniae. These results seem to me to dej)end chiefly of course on the nature of the constriction, but are increased or modified by the extent of the protrusion, and the treatment adopted prior to operation. The very nature of the constriction is essentially dangerous ; for if we consider the long narrow canal of communication which exists between the general peri- toneal sac and the tunica vaginalis, and the process of condensa- tion, elongation, and increased obliquity, which it undergoes as the patient advances towards adult age, we will at once perceive how difficult it will be for a hernial protrusion to descend ; and having descended into the scrotum, and become distended or congested, how almost impossible to return it by taxis; especially Avhen we further recollect the unyielding texture of the walls of the canal of communication in such a case. This resistant, un- yielding character is easily seen when the hernia is down, and indeed often forms a cause of doubt as to the scrotal swelling being a hernia; for there is apparently no continuous neck pass-

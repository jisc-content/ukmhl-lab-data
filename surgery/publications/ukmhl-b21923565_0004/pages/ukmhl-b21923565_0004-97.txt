CLINICAL CASES AND COMMENTARIES. 1071 cachectic, she had become pale, and felt more feeble than for- merly ; whilst the enormous bulk and weight, together with the increasing deformity, rendered her almost unfit for any duty, and gave rise to great mental depression, so that she was most anxious to have the tumour removed at all hazards. The con- sideration of these first two questions resulted in a decision favourable to operative interference. It now remained to con- sider how far the size and connections of the-tumour admitted of removal by operation without immediate risk to the patient's life ; and to plan the procedure by which this could be most readily and safely effected. The great bulk of a tumour, though always a source of risk, from the extensive incisions requisite for its removal, the amount of surface exposed, and the propor- tional hfemorrhage, venous and arterial, does not necessarily render the operation more difficult; on the contrary, the very size gives a power of leverage which often facilitates the dis- section. But when the mass is so situated as to present a large surface, it may be adherent to, or in close connection with vitally important parts, then the operation required for its re- moval becomes most formidable. These elements of difficulty and danger were present to their fullest extent in my patient's case ; for, besides the enormous bulk of the tumour, it was developed beneath the sterno-mastoid, and its deep surface was necessarily in the closest relation with the great vessels and important nerves in the cervical region, from the lower jaw to within an inch of the sternum, and stretching backwards to the margin of the trapezius muscle ; whilst the facial portion felt fixed in the parotid region, as if deeply niched behind the ramus of the jaw ; and it could be felt projecting towards the fauces within the mouth. The bulk, form, and position of the tumour rendered it impossible to ascertain positively whether or not it adhered at any point to the sheath of the vessels ; and the appa- rent mobility of a large cervical growth can never altogether be depended on ; for, even if it involve or be adherent to the vessels or their sheath, these, being loosely connected, move with the tumour on the more fixed parts. But in the face of these risks

LECTUEE CXII. Treatment of Hernia by Operation—Eesults—The Extra-Peritoneal Operation— The Ordinary Operation—After-Treatment: Local and General. The Operation for Hernia consists essentially in the divi- sion of the constriction of the hernia ; but to reach this con- striction we require to divide certain parts, vs^hich differ in the special hernise. The great object is to expose the constricted part, and to divide it thoroughly and completely. To do this in all cases of hernia, whether large or small, the incision should be made so as to give us plenty of room over the part corre- sponding to the neck of the sac, or where we expect to meet with the constriction. In inguinal hernia, there is no use making an incision down the whole length of the scrotum ; in fact, this very often misleads. The incision should be made where we feel the neck of the hernia, and should extend above and beyond this so as to let us see the parts properly ; and for this, an incision two or three inches in length is quite sufficient. If we expose the parts too much, we are very apt to have a quantity of the intes- tine coming out of the incision. The incision should be no longer in a large than in a small hernia. We should aim at exposing the part where the constriction exists, and then we see exactly what textures we require to divide, for these are different in different herniee, though the principle of the operation is the same in all cases. The constriction may be in the apo- neurosis through which the hernia has passed out ; or it may be in some condensed cellular tissue, external to the neck of the sac, for a few fibres will sometimes cause constriction ; or it may be, and very generally is, in the sac itself. The constriction in old-standing and in congenital herniae is almost invariably owing to thickening in the neck of the sac itself This thickening takes

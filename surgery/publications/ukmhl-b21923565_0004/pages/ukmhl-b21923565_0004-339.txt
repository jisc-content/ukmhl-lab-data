DIFFERENT FORMS OF STRICTURE. 1299 condition, however, is so modified by the position and extent of the deposit, and consequent alteration in structure, as to give rise to the different forms of stricture. These may be classified under two headsâ€”1st, Contractions of the canal of the urethra caused by plastic deposit external to the mucous membrane into the submucous tissue, or involving the other textures and causing, to a greater or less extent, in length and depth, consoli- dation of the spongy erectile structure ; 2d, Contractions or obstruction of the canal due to the deposit and organisation of plastic material on the free or internal surface of the mucous membrane, whether in the form of lateral folds of false mem- brane, thread-like bands of lymph, or false membrane stretching between the surfaces, or projecting wart-like masses. Strictures arising from organised plastic deposit on the submuc- ous aspect of the canal are by far the most frequent. The plastic lymph causing the contraction may be very limited in breadth, but may be deposited so as to include the whole circumference of the canal at the affected point; and as it becomes consolidated and organised, it forms a firm circle round the exterior of the mucous canal, constituting what is termed the annular stricture. This form of contraction may occur at any part of the passage, but is most frequently met with in strictures situated in the anterior regions of the urethra, and especially in those about two inches from the orifice. In such circumstances we can feel a little hard mass from the exterior; and when a solid instrument is passed fairly through such a contraction and along the urethra beyond, the narrow ring of consolidation is very distinctly defined, and can be felt by the finger. On examining the con- stricted point in a morbid specimen of this nature, we find the submucous tissue, and also frequently the spongy texture, consolidated and altered by the new material. On trying to raise the mucous membrane by dissection, we find it firmly adherent at the constricted point, and under it a somewhat flattened band of white fibrous tissue, which is usually very elastic and resilient. In other instances, as in strictixres near the bulb, the new material generally involves a greater extent of

1196 REGIONAL SURGERY. The after-treatment is similar to that of ordinary inguinal herniaâ€”only we must avoid pressure on the testicle, if it lies in the inguinal canal. In some cases we can draw it so far down as to be able to apply the compress higher up. But in cases where the shortness of the cord will not admit of this, there is often difficulty in avoiding pressure upon the testicle in retaining the hernia, and even without direct pressure it some- times inflames, swells, and gives trouble in the treatment of these cases. Infantile Hernia exists in different forms, and has been differently described by surgical authorities. The general cha- racteristics are that it passes down behind, not into, the tunica vaginalis, very often splitting up the constituent parts of the cord from each other, so that it has the spermatic vessels some- times on the surface and sometimes at one or other side. The principal peculiarity is, that in operating on such a hernia we first come down upon a serous sac, which when opened contains no gut. Behind this is some cellular tissue, and under this again is the sac containing the intestine. When operating therefore, if we remember that the part of the tunica vaginalis corresponding to the cord lies in front of the true hernial sac, we will be prepared to proceed without hesitation if we meet with this complication.

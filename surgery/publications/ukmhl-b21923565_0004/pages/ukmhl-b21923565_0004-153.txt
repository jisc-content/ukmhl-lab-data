CLINICAL CASES. 1125 Remarks.—The removal of the sternal half of the clavicle in this case was, I consider, sufficiently warranted by the state of the patient, the constitutional irritation he was suffering, and the repeated formation of ill-conditioned abscesses at the root of the neck, and in dangerous proximity to the large vessels. Under these circumstances there was distinct indication for operative interference, either by removing the diseased portions of the clavicle, or by removing the whole sternal haK of the bone at the articulation. I preferred the latter operation for the fol- lowing reasons :—The diseased portion which presented itself was not loose or detached, and the probe introduced through the sinuses detected other altered portions nearer the sternum ; so that the full extent of the disease could not be accurately ascertained ; and as the character of the disease and state of the patient's general health forbade waiting for nature to throw off' the dead portions, it appeared to me that the operation necessary for the removal of such diseased portions would be equally severe, and the effect less certain, whilst removal of the internal half of the clavicle would remove the whole disease; and as the con- tinuity between it and the acromial end was already broken, union being maintained only by ligamentous tissue, the inner half was really of no use to the patient. The difficulties which in this case rendered the operation more protracted than I expected from numerous trials on the dead body, were owing principally to the previous disease having caused great alteration in the parts around the bone ; these were condensed, and their appearance, relations, and attachments altered close to the position of the subclavian vessels. The firm- ness of the new attachments prevented the clavicle being drawn forwards from these vessels, and rendered a cautious dissection necessary to free that portion of the bone, the altered and ir- regular form of which, from the deposition of new osseous matter, was also a cause of difficulty, as it prevented me keeping the edge of the bistoury close to its posterior surface. I conceive that stage of the operation the most dangerous; but when the posterior surface of the bone is smooth, or when, after separating

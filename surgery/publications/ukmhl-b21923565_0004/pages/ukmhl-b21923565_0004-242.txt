REGIONAL SURGERY. 1210 intestine before proceeding to enlarge the incision, in order that the convolutions may not protrude and embarrass us, or run the risk of injury. As regards large portions of omentum, either in this or other forms of hernia, if much manipulation is likely to be required to return it, bad consequences are apt to follow, so that I be- lieve it is better, in many instances, to remove the mass en- tirely, or in part, rather than continue efforts to return it, as it is very apt to take on a sloughy action. When the hernia is reduced, and the wound closed, we require to apply a compress of lint and a folded towel, supported by a broad binder or flannel bandage. When lecturing on the subject of reducible hernia, and the palliative treatment by trusses, I stated that the consideration of the Radical Cure would be better appreciated after discussing the special herniae. The radical cure of hernia, though it has of recent years attracted attention, and been brought prominently before the profession, has from time immemorial been attempted to be ob- tained by various methods—by operation, or otherwise. Thus, the application of medicated compresses or plasters, combined with rest in the horizontal position for weeks or months, at one period had its successes and its advocates; and as for operative procedures having the same object in view, their name is legion, and they have been practised from the days of Abulcasis to the present time. I can merely name some of the general plans, such as exposing the sac, and, after reducing its contents, applying the heated cautery to the exterior of the neck of the sac; or even opening the sac and cauterising the interior by actual or poten- tial cautery—ligature of the neck of the sac, so as to cause con- solidation and obliteration—incision of the sac—excision of the sac, either by dissecting it from the scrotum, or partial excision of a part of it. The last-mentioned plans were the operations which, together with lithotomy, at one period formed a specialism as we would now call it, in the hands of itinerant operators like Franco and Frere Jacques;—some of them, however, so ignorant, both of the anatomy and functions of the parts, that we are told

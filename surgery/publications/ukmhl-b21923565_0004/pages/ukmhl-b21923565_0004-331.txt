1291 FORCIBLE CATHETERISM. is thus formed, and great benefit experienced. ' By passing a catheter, and guiding it carefully in the first portion of the pro- static part of the urethra, then, by attention to the axis of the pelvis, making it pass into the bladder, by forcing it through the substance of the prostate, and keeping it in for forty-eight hours, a new canal will be opened in a much more direct lineâ€”the urine will continue to pass through it, and the canal will remain per- manently open. This method should only be adopted when we cannot pass a catheter through the ordinary passage. It is safer and more satisfactory in its results, however, than puncturing the bladder above the pubes, and is much more likely to relieve the retention permanently ; and I believe it to be safer than con- tinued efforts to find the natural canal, when there has been much rough treatment with the catheter. 4 p

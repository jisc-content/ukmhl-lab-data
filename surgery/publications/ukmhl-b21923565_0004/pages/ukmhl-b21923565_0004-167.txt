LUMBAR ABSCESS. 1139 an uiiliealthy state of the constitution, and hence that, under any method of treatment, irritative fever may supervene. When the matter is homogeneous, and not curdy, we may draw off the pus with the exhausting syringe, or with tubing under water, as I described when lecturing on chronic abscess ; but if, as is generally the case, the pus is of unequal consistence, it is better to make a free incision, to permit of the pus being fully evacu- ated, and in doing this you may use a piece of folded lint, soaked in carbolised oil, laid over the part. The incision should be made through one fold of the lint, and then the other fold allowed to fall over it; the pus escapes by the sides, or soaks tliroixgh, and when the pus has all escaped, a fresh piece of oiled lint is laid over the other, and covered with gutta percha tissue, and a soft towel folded is placed over all, supported by a bandage. If any irritation follows, this dressing must be removed, and ordi- nary poultices applied. Subsequently the cavity may be washed out with weak carbolic lotion, or the chlorinated soda lotion, or watery solution of iodine. When the abscess projects, and re- quires to be opened in the inguino-femoral region, you must keep in mind the position of the great vessels which are sometimes displaced by the collection; but the more general risks are injury of the saphena vein, or branches of the inguino-pudic artery, or branches of the internal circumflex artery; and hence the inci- sions should be made after careful examination of the prominent part of the swelling, to avoid any large superficial vein, and to ascertain that no artery is felt pulsating at the point you in- tend to make your incision or enter the trocar.

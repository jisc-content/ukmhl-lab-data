viii PREFACE. possible for a Student to have a good knowledge of Anatomy, and yet not be versed in applying that knowledge to the practice of Surgery. Surgical Anatomy, properly understood, implies not merely relation of parts, but such an acquaintance with the position, functions, and relations of the structures entering into the formation of any region, as may assist in the diagnosis and treat- ment of the injuries and diseases occurring in it; or in certain cases to judge how far operative interference is warrantable, and guide us if it be, in planning and per- forming the operation.

The range of subjects treated of in these Lectures is so large as to render it quite impossible to enter fully upon all. I have therefore devoted more space to the important subjects, in which, from various circumstances, I have had an exceptionally large experience, such as Tumours, Diseases of the Vascular System, Excisions of Joints, Amputation, Injuries of the Head, Diseases and Injuries of the Air Passages, Hernia, and Diseases of the Urinary Organs. Even in regard to these the Lectures are necessarily suggestive, not exhaustive as in the case of monographs; the other parts of the work, again, though more briefly treated, will be found to contain all that is essential or of practical interest. In conclusion, I have to acknowledge the assistance aff"orded me by my friend Dr. Taylor, in preparing for the press and compiling the Index, and to Dr. Thomas Balfour, for his assistance in the revision of the later portion of the work. In regard to the artistic department, I am specially indebted to the kind offices of my friend J

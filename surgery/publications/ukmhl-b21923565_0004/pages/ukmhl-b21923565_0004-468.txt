REGIONAL SURGERY. 1424 Remarks.—The features of this case which seem to me most suggestive of remark are: 1st, The small amomit,^ almost entire absence of those morbid appearances which generally result from an inflammation of the peritoneum characterised by such urgent symptoms, and such an extremely irritant exciting cause. When we recollect the amount of organic changes —such as extreme and general vascularity of the serous surface, the eifusion of turbid serum and masses of lymph, and the matting together of the viscera—which usually follow the escape of even a small quantity of the con- tents of the intestines in cases of minute perforation ; or in cases where a comparatively small quantity of urine is extravasated into the sub-peritoneal cellular tissue ; it seems to me that the absence of such appearances in this, and some other similar cases recorded, can only be accounted for on the supposition that the extremely destructive character of the extravasated urine in large quantity, and in immediate contact with the peritoneal surface, may so depress the vital powers as to prevent the formation of the ordinary inflammatory products ; a supposition, however, somewhat difficult to reconcile with the acute nature of the symptoms during life, and the period intervening between the receipt of the injury and its fatal ter- mination. The next remarkable feature of this case, and that which is most diffi- cult of satisfactory explanation, is, the occurrence of retention of urine requiring to be relieved by the use of the catheter whilst there existed a rent in the bladder, through which we might have expected the urine to have escaped freely into the abdominal cavity. I know that it has been suggested that in such cases the urine does escape from the bladder, and that it is drawn off from the peritoneal cavity by the catheter passing through the wound of the bladder. The reasons assigned for this opinion are, first, the large qirantity of urine drawn off in some of the cases, being in amount beyond the capacity of the bladder ; and, secondly, the appar- ently physical impossibility of any considerable quantity of urine being retained in the bladder when such a wound exists in its coats. In regard to the former of these reasons, I do not consider it of much weight ; because, in common with every surgeon who has had much experience in urinary cases, I know that, not unfrequently, cases of retention are met with where the quantity of urine drawn oft" is so enormous as to show it to be very difficult to calculate the capacity of the bladder, under certain circumstances. As to the second reason alluded to, whilst I grant the great difficulty of affording a satisfactory explanation of the retention of urine co-existing with such a wound of the bladder, yet the opposite hypo- thesis presents physical conditions eqiially difficult of explanation ; and it will not do to reject all the phenomena observed during the progress of a case, merely because we have great difficulty in explaining the co-existence of certain apparently opposed physical conditions. In the present case, the symptoms, both objective and subjective, noted during life, appear to me to amount to a demonstration that the urine evacuated by the catheter was contained in the bladder, and not diffused through the peritoneal cavity. A tumour corresponding to the distended bladder could be felt above the pubis, and disappeared when the urine was drawn off. The quantity on each occasion was not beyond the average amount in retention, and after the first thirty-six hours it was clear and

In cases of patients affected with tertiary syphilis, we not unfre- quently meet with a hard indolent enlargement of the testicle, combined with hydrocele—Syphilitic Hydko-Sarcocele. This condition is one in which you must be very cautious in having recourse to removal of the testicle, when the disease occurs in a cachectic person, or one past middle life. In such cases I have seen a low unhealthy form of gangrenous erysipelas attack the wound, and diffuse infiltration take place along the cord, and lead to fatal results. Puncture of the hydrocele and injec- tion with iodine do good, if assisted by internal remedies but removal of the testicle under the peculiar state of the constitution I consider to be hardly warrantable. In scrofulous patients subacute orchitis frequently terminates in suppuration in the substance of the gland, and gives rise either to extensive sinuses and small suppurating cavities in the gland, or to a larger ulceration of the tunica albuginea and scrotal coverings at some point, followed by the protrusion of a fungus of very formidable appearance. This latter condition is termed the ScKOFULous Fungoid Testicle. The treatment of sinuses in the substance of the testis con-

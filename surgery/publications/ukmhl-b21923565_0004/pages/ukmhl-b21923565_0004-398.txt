REGIONAL SURGERY. 1356 infiltration of the loose submucous tissue. When we examine the part we find two swellings with a deep narrow sulcus be- tween them. In front there is the swelling caused by the mucous lining of the prepuce and the glans penis ; posteriorly, the swollen and inflamed integument of the prepuce; and on separating the swellings we perceive at the bottom of the intervening sulcus the tight constriction caused by the un- yielding margin of the prepuce. In the treatment of paraphy- mosis we must remember that, unless the condition be relieved, strangulation of the constricted parts will be the result, and sloughing not only of the prepuce, but even of the glans penis, may occur. We must therefore be prompt in our measures of relief If called to the patient in the early stage ; by punctur- ing the oedematous swelling in front, and by compressing the glans penis with one hand whilst we draw forward the prepuce with the other, we often succeed in removing the malposition of parts. But if there is any difficulty, the operation required for paraphymosis is so simple and so slight that we should have recourse to it at once. The operation consists in separating the two swellings, so as to expose the constriction at the bottom of the sulcus, and then with the point of a tenotomy knife or narrow bistoury notching the constricting ring deeply at two or three points of its circumference ; this at once relieves the con- striction, and the prepuce is easily replaced, and when this is accomplished, the marks of the knife can scarcely be perceived. The so-called operation is really less painful and less likely to injure the parts than attempts at reduction by pulHng forcibly on the prepuce. Cold-water dressing, to allay excited action, is all the after-treatment which is required. Inflammatory swelling of the testicle—Orchitis, or Hernia Humoralis, as it is sometimes termed—arises from various causes, but perhaps more frequently during retrocedent gonor-

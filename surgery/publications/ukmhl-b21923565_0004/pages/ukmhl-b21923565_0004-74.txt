REGIONAL SURGERY. 1048 above the isthmus of the thyroid, by pushing that structure down, so as to expose the upper rings of the trachea. Hitherto I have not done so ; but from what I have seen of the diffi- culties in short muscular necks, I would especially advise that to be done when operating for laryngeal spasm depend- ing on aneurism, particularly if there be any reason to suspect that dyspnoea depends on direct pressure, as by doing so we will diminish the risk of injuring the aneurismal sac on introduc- ing the tube. Both in the adult and child it is sometimes advisable to fix the trachea with a sharp hook before opening it. The position of the patient, and general steps of the opera- tion, are the same as in tracheotomy in the child. The incision through the skin should be commenced a little above the cricoid cartilage, and continued downwards in the mesial line, for two or two and a half inches, through the skin, fat, and fascia, so as to expose the intermuscular texture connecting the sterno-hyoid muscles. The superficial veins are seen and guarded. Next the intermuscular texture is freely divided, and the sterno-hyoid and thyroid muscles separated with the handle of the scalpel. Then the large inferior thyroid veins and the isthmus of the thyroid body are pushed out of the way with the point of the finger, and the trachea opened, above or below the isthmus, as the nature of the case may determine. In operating on persons in whom the rings of the trachea are ossified, the surgeon should- provide him- self with a pair of very strong scissors or small bone-pliers, to divide the ossified rings. The trachea-tube should always have a broad shield or metal band to maintain it in position. The after-treatment is somewhat similar to that for the operation for croup. Any venous hfemorrhage generally ceases when the difficult breathing is relieved. If, however, it should continue, a little bit of lint pressed under the shield of the tube will suffice to arrest it.

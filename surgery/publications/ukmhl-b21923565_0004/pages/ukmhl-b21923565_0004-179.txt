1151 EFFECT OF THE TRUSS IN CHILDREN. measuring-tape over the lower aperture, pass it slopingly upwards to about two inclies below the crest of the ilium, across the back to the same point on the opposite side, and from that, sloping down again, to the opening. The measure in inches will give the size of the truss required. State the kind of hernia, and the side on which it is situated. Whilst in adults afflicted with hernia the use of the truss can only be considered as a palliative, in children a carefully- applied truss, worn continuously, very generally effects a radical cure, by retaining the protrusion and compressing the canal through which it had descended; for, as the abdominal cavity enlarges, and its parietes are developed, the obliquity of the canal increases, so that the tendency to hernia is checked by the altered relations of the openings, whilst at the same time the textures are condensed by the continued pressure. In applying trusses in children, the pads or compresses should be of a flattened form, and not conical, for the latter form has the tendency to keep open the aperture and prevent permanent closure. This error is often committed in fitting trusses for umbilical hernia in infants, in which it is not uncommon to find the truss fitted with a conical or button-shaped pad, with the view of pressing into the aperture through which the rupture emerges. This may, no doubt, directly prevent the escape of the protrusion, but it also effectually maintains the aperture patent, and so prevents a radical cure. Operations for effecting the radical cure of hernia, though connected with the treatment of reducible herniee, will be better understood after considering the special hernise, and the opera- tive procedure in strangu.lated herniae.

Such lesions, therefore, as miyht in other parts of the body heal without treatment, are by these causes pro- tracted and aggravated, so that, instead of being ameliorated by time, their severity is generally in direct proportion to their duration. Partly from an ill-founded hope of natural recovery, and partly from delicacy and fear, patients generally postpone con- sultation until increasing pain and declining health compel them.

1097 CLINICAL CASES AND COMMENTARIES. have little hesitation in saying that bronchitis or broncho- pneumonia almost invariably occurs after it. I draw attention to this because bronchial effusion forms a most serious complica- tion in very young children after tracheotomy, and is indeed one of the great objections to the operation in cases of croup. When present to any extent it has generally been held, in this country at least, to contra-indicate tracheotomy, and, I think, witli good reason. In children under three or four years of age, from the small size of the tube we can introduce, it is apt to become choked with the tenacious mucus, as happened in one of the cases nar- rated ; and as, of course, we cannot make the infant understand how to cause forcible expulsion of the mucus from time to time, by placing the fingers so as to diminisli the orifice of the tube, or of the wound, as we can in older children or adults, such a case is entirely dependent on the care and experience of the attendant or nurse in the after-treatment; and the danger of extensive bronchitis in a child of that age, even apart from other complications, is too well known to need to be insisted on. In no operation, perhaps, do the chances of success depend more on the care and watching of the patient by experienced attendants than in tracheotomy. In looking back on the cases detailed, I cannot but think that, had the patient Lindsay been in the hospital, the residt would probably have been as successful as the cases of Blakeley and Stark ; certainly his state at the time of the operation was fully as favourable, and, when I last saw him alive, he was progressing well. Indeed, the history of his case shows pretty clearly, that the paroxysm of dyspnoea, owing to the obstructed tube, led to fatal cerebral congestion and effu- sion. In all cases, it is obviously desirable to remove the tube early; but the foregoing 'Cases, as well as other cases of tracheo- tomy, have shown me that you can never venture to do so with- out being prepared to replace it at any moment on account of some paroxysm of obstructed respiration; and this implies the necessity of having proper assistance at hand, a condition not easily attained in private practice.

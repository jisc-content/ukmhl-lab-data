EXPLANATION OF THE PLATES. HERNIA.—Clinical Case.—Plate LVIII.—Page 1410. View of the parts in a case of femoral hernia, in which the irregular obturator artery constricted the hernial protrusion, and required to be tied and divided to relieve the constriction. The distal end of the obturator artery is obliterated, and the ligature has sepa- rated. The ligature still remains on the proximal end of the artery, which is much diminished in size, whilst the epigastric is proportionately enlarged. See Clinical Cases.

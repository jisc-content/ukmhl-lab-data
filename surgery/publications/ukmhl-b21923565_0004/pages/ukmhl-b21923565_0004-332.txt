Eetention of Urine from Stricture of the Urethra—Spasmodic or Congested Stric- ture : Treatment—Organic Stricture—Anatomy of the male Urethra—Patho- logy of Urethral Stricture—Morbid Changes in other parts of the Genito- urinary Organs arising from Stricture—Fistula in Perineo. Perhaps the most frequent and dangeroiTs cause of retention of urine is contraction of the canal of the urethra, leading to ob- struction, and constituting Stricture of the Urethra. The urethra may be contracted either temporarily from some irritation leading to spasm and engorgement, or from true organic stricture, resulting from inflammatory affections, such as gonorrhoea, lead- ing to consolidation and contraction in the parts. To the former of these kinds of constriction—the functional, or spasmodic, or engorged stricture—the term stricture should scarcely be applied. It is a mere temporary contraction, for there exists no real stricture. It arises in most cases from some irritation about the neck of the bladder, as in gonorrhoea, when the prostatic part of the urethra becomes irritable and the patient is constantly passing water over it, or from exposure to cold, or after some debauch. The bladder becomes distended, and the patient can- not pass water at all—the penis is semi-erect—the spongy part of the urethra is engorged, and there is a feeling of contrac- tion and irritation, and intense pain and spasm about the rectum and neck of the bladder, with spasmodic attempts to make water —the patient striving in agony to pass a few drops of urine. In such cases the patient may suffer to such an extent from the retention, that we may require at once to use a catheter to relieve him; we must, however, be very cautious in using it, and employ means to allay the pain and irritation when passing it

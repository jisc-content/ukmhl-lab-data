1268 REGIONAL SURGERY. towards and opens the membranous part of the urethra, and runs his knife along the groove of the staff into the bladder. He now introduces the forefinger of his left hand into the rectum above the base of the prostate, to guide the knife. ISText, by raising the handle of his knife, he depresses its point, so as to puncture the bladder immediately above the base of the prostate, and then placing his left forefinger so as to press on the projected point of the knife, he carries it down, dividing the anterior wall of the rectum, prostate, sphincter ani, and intervening structures in the central line. Or he may proceed in a different and more sum- mary manner. Placing two fingers of the left hand into the rectum, as for puncture of the bladder, the surgeon feels the groove of the staff above the base of the prostate, and then introducing a long sharp-pointed curved bistoury flat upon the fingers, he turns its point forwards, punctures the bladder in the groove of the staff where it is felt above the prostate, and by throwing back the handle of the bistoury carries its point forwards along the groove into the perineum, projects it through the skin about an inch in front of the anus, and then drawing the blade towards himself, lays the track of the wound through the bladder, urethra, and rectum, freely open. Through this large wound any stone that can possibly pass through the inferior outlet of the pelvis may be extracted ; and whilst few will be found who would follow this method as a general plan, I should undoubtedly prefer it to the high operation for the extraction of large calculi, and, as I have stated, the results in regard to safety to life, and even as to the healing of the recto-vesical wound, are more satisfactory than we might have expected. The risk of haemorrhage must be kept in mind, for hsemorrhage from branches of the middle heemorrhoidal artery, or from the inferior part of the prostatic plexus, is liable to occur, but from the size of the opening, the bleeding, if noticed, can in general be easily arrested by ligature or pressure. Before concluding the consideration of the operative pro- cedure in lithotomy, I would draw your attention to the im-

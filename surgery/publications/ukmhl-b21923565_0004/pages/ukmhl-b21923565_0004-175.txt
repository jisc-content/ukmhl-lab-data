1147 EXCITING CA USES OF HERNIA. congenital or acquired, in the abdominal parietes, which renders them less able to resist impulses which project the viscera against the weakened parts, and are similar, or rather the same, conditions I have already mentioned when describing the descent of a hernia. The exciting causes are chiefly due to the action of the abdominal muscles upon the contained viscera, forcing them .towards the weak points in the parietes. This may occur under different circumstancesâ€”as, for example, from some sudden and violent effort; or as the result of frequent though less violent muscular efforts continued during a long period of time, as in certain chronic diseases, such as stricture, or enlarged prostate, when the abdominal muscles are called into action to assist the muscular coats of the bladder to overcome the obstruction ; or in cases of chronic bronchitis, where the diaphragm and other abdominal muscles are caUed into action by the constant efforts in coughing. In either the sudden or more chronic form, if you recollect the elastic and mobile nature of the floating viscera, and consider the effect produced on them when pressed on from above and below, by the opposing forces of the diaphragm and levator ani, and from before and laterally by the recti, oblique, and transversales muscles, you will understand how the elastic mass so com- pressed tends to escape towards the least resisting points of the parietes, and to be protruded, either suddenly or gradually, at one or other of the weak points, according to circumstances. In regard to the part at which the protrusion may take place, that will depend partly on some predisposing weakness in struc- ture, as already explained ; partly on the shape of the abdomen and pelvis ; and partly on the form of the diaphragm, as tending to cause the force to impinge upon certain points rather than others. The late Mr. Vincent, in his work on Surgical Practice, explains this effect produced by the diaphragm by reference to its figure and the curves of its muscular fibres. " The figure of the diaphragm is that of an arched dome; but having a tendinous expansion in the middle, it is divided into two arches of muscular fibres. Now it is clear that if a muscular fibre 4 F

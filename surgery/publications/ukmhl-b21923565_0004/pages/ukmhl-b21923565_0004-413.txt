CHIMNEY-SWEEPERS CANCER. 1371 even when the skin is so affected as to enable us to save but little, if any, it is wonderful how these organs become covered in by borrowing from the loose integuments of the ab- domen and perineum. Delp^che, in his Clinique Chirurgicale, has given the de- tails of a case of elephantiasis of the scrotum in which, by plan- ing his incisions, he obtained a covering for the parts at the time he removed the tumour; but in such prolonged and complicated dissections amongst hypertrophied and vascular tissues, the risk of the patient sinking from loss of blood is so great that it is better to take the more rapid methods of procedure. Before pro- ceeding to the removal of the diseased mass, careful examination should be made to ascertain that there is no hernial protrusion on either side, as that condition has been found present, and if it be, the steps of the operation must be conducted with great care, and in some cases a large scrotal hernia might contra-indicate the operation. The scrotal integuments are sometimes attacked by epithelial cancer. The parts present the usual appearances of that disease, and must be removed by the knife before the neighbouring lymphatic glands become affected. In operating, the integu- ments should be removed wide of the diseased part, and very little anxiety need be experienced as to there being sufficient covering left. In one case I removed almost the whole of the scrotal integuments, so that at the time it was impossible to cover in the testicles, yet in less than six weeks the wound was completely cicatrised without any apparent deformity; at all events, we must remove the disease thoroughly if we interfere at all. There is a peculiar form of epithelial cancer of the scrotum in which the disease seems to arise from the effects of a direct local irritant. I allude to what is termed Chimney-Sweeper's Cancer, or Soot-Wart, It is said by some that this is a peculiarly malignant form of disease, and it is quite true that if it be allowed to go on until the inguinal glands become affected and ulcerated, and till the ulceration extends A u

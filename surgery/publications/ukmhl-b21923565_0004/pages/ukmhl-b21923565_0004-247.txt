LECTUEE CXVI. Injuries of tlie Bladder and Urethra : their Dangers ; Treatment—Stone in the Bladder : Causes ; Symptoms—Diagnosis between it and other Diseases— Prognosis as to result of Operations, according to the Nature of the Concre- tion. I NOW pass on to treat of the injuries and diseases of the pelvic viscera, commencing with those of the genito-urinary system. Injuries of the Bladder or urethra may occur as the result either of penetrating wound or of force directly applied ; or from indirect force in certain injuries of the pelvis. The most frequent site at which the urethra is wounded or lacer- ated is in the perineal portion of its course. In this position I have seen several cases of direct wound from persons falling on some sharp substance ; in some of the cases, in young children, it occurred from the breaking of an earthenware chamber-pot. In these cases the wound attracted immediate attention, and prompt treatment. The catheter was introduced at once, and retained for twenty-four or forty-eight hours, until the soft parts in the perineum were glazed with lymph, and then introduced occasionally from time to time until the wound finally closed, and also for some time subsequently, to prevent the contraction giving rise to stricture. All the cases of this kind which I have seen, did well at the time ; but I have had to treat some of them in after years for very bad stricture, owing to their neglect of the occasional introduction of an instrument. In such cases, when the superficial wound is small, or the soft parts over the wounded urethra imperfectly divided, I would advise the practice I have always adopted of dilating the wound freely in the line of the raphe of the perineum, to afford free outlet for the urine, pus, and sloughs of cellular tissue.

In entering on the subject of Abdominal Heenia, I cannot help feeling how inadequately I can treat of so important a department of surgery in the space I can devote to it in a course of lectures in which so many other diseases must be considered; and I feel the difiiculty all the more perhaps, because I have had, owing to various circumstances, a larger amount of experience in hernial cases than falls to the lot of most surgeons. This renders the task of condensation more difficult; for with the practical knowledge that there are scarcely any two cases of hernia exactly alike, and that these individual peculiarities have important bearings on the practice in each case, it is not easy to lay down a few general principles when exceptional conditions are so numerous. The value of experience in such circumstances is rather in regard to details and emergencies in complicated cases. I shall, however, attempt to bring before you, as succinctly as I can some general principles of action embodying and founded on results tested by my own experience. By the term hernia we mean a protrusion of a part of the viscera through some weak point in the abdominal parietes, generally through some natural canal or opening, which has become dilated, or through some adventitious aperture, caused by separa- tion of aponeurotic fibres, from distension of the abdominal parietes. Except in cases of direct penetrating wounds, pro-

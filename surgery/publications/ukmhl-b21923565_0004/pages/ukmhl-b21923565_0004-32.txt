We now pass on to the consideration of Injukies and Diseases OF THE AiE-PASSAGES. As these are of great importance, re- quiring prompt and decided surgical interference, the student should make himself familiar with all their details, and espe- cially with those circumstances which indicate the necessity of having recourse to the operations of tracheotomy or laryngotomy. We shall first treat of Injuries of the air-passages. Injuries of the larynx are of different kinds, and may arise from blows, or from falls upon the box of the larynx, or from compression, as in manual strangulation. In young subjects the cartilages of the larynx are very soft and pliable ; and whilst they may, by direct violence, be pressed against each other, for a time, so as to prevent breathing, still their natural elasticity causes the parts to regain their normal form immediately after the pres- sure has been removed. In persons beyond middle life, however, the cartilages are strong and resistent, possessing both elasticity and absolute strength, so that they are not easily compressed by direct force. The cases where there is most risk of injury to the larynx are either those of young subjects, for the reason stated, or those of persons, rather advanced in life, where the cartilages are beginning to undergo ossification. When the cartilages are completely ossified they acquire a certain amoimt of resistance, and are not likely to yield to an ordinary degree of force; but

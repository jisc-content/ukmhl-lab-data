IMPERFORA TE ANUS: AFTER- TREA TMENT. 1401 ing to fatal consequences. In all such cases it is necessary to maintain the orifice patent, and to prevent contraction during the healing process. A portion of gum elastic, or wax bougie, is generally used for this purpose, or a portion of sponge tent. The sponge tent is useful after a time, but too irritating at first. The substance I have found to answer best immediately after the operation, is a conical suppository composed of beeswax and soap. Afterwards a large bougie or a sponge tent should be introduced occasionally to prevent contraction. The tendency to contraction continues for a long timeâ€”for years indeed. In one case in which I had operated I was con- sulted by the patient when he was about twenty years of age on account of the inconvenience caused by the contraction of the orifice. I found it would hardly admit a No. 9 urethral bougie, yet he was in perfect health. I enlarged the orifice freely by a crucial incision, and advised him as to the occasional use of the rectum bougie, and as I have heard nothing of him for many years, I presume the contraction has not recurred. One peculiar anatomical fact in regard to imperforate anus is, that in the worst form, even when there is no anal depression, it has been found on dissection that the fibres of the superficial sphincter can be distinctly traced under the skin. In cases where the cul-de-sac cannot be reached, it has been proposed to open the descending colon.in the left lumbar, or the sigmoid flexure of the colon in the left iliac region, and success- ful cases are recorded, but in general we could hardly expect, or even I may say desire, such a success in an infant.

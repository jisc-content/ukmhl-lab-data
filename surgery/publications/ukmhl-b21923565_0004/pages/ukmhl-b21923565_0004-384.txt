When retention arises from some special cause, that, of course, must be attended to, besides relieving the bladder with the catheter. Thus, in the case of retained menstrual discharge, the hymen must be divided by a small crucial incision; the opening dilated with the finger, the collected discharge evacu- ated, and the vagina washed out with tepid watery solution of carbolic acid, and an opiate given, as considerable irritation and even danger of metritis sometimes follows this simple operation. "When caruncles or the painful vascular wart-like growths are present, they must be removed by ligature, or the knife or scissors, and the cut surface touched with nitrate of silver. Polypoid tumours of the uterus must be removed if their cha- racter and attachments admit of that being done; and in cases of ante- or retro- version of the uterus, means must be taken to re- place and maintain the organ in its natural position. Should an organic stricture be found, it will be best treated by gradual dilatation, or by splitting it, as in Holt's operation in the male, and then the patency of the canal must be maintained by the occasional use of a bougie or catheter.

The patient, when suffering from chronic laryngitis, may get a little fresh cold ; a sort of subacute attack supervenes—effusion from the vessels occurs into the loose cellular tissue, which, superadded to the previously existing swelling, nearly blocks up the larynx, and if irritation and spasm come on, death may result. Whilst these chronic conditions vary to a certain extent, the immediate cause of death is generally a sudden attack of oedema glottidis. A patient so afflicted has generally, in addition to a troublesome and harassing cough, very marked symptoms of general debility. He presents a pale and sickly aspect. His lips are blanched or livid.

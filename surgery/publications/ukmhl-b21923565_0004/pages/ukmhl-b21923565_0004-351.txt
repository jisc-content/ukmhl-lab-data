CATHETERISM IN STRICTURE CASES. 1311 moderate and sustained degree of force is warranted, and neces- sary to pass the instrument onwards to the bladder. I would here advert to another point in reference to pass- ing the catheter'in tight strictures â€” namely, that when the instrument has fairly passed through the stricture, it is some- times difficult to guide the point through the membranous and prostatic portions of the canal, from the firmness with which the body of the instrument is held in the stricture, and hence the use of the finger of the left hand being introduced into the rectum to guide the point of the catheter in its onward course. In all your manipulations in such cases, you must keep before you the natural direction and course of the urethra, in conjunc- tion with the anatomy of the parts, both in their healthy and morbid states ; but the tact in using instruments, and various manoeuvres by which difficulties are sometimes overcome, can, I believe, only be learned by each one for himself, as the result of experience; and on such experience, and the resources which he has in himself, will depend the greater success of one man than another in the treatment of stricture. In difficult cases of tight unyielding stricture, the probe-pointed steel stricture- staff is often of service to make way for the silver catheter, which, when of small size, has not sufficient rigidity to enable us to direct it so readily through the contraction and onwards. My colleague, Dr. Watson, uses a probe-pointed steel catheter. I never myself found occasion to use it, but I can conceive it of service in some cases. In most cases, however, when there has been great difficulty in passing a small instrument in cases of retention, I think it advisable to leave in the catheter, and should prefer a silver to the steel instrument for that purpose, and I confess to a dread of the temper of a hollow steel instrument, so that I have in very difficult cases proceeded by passing a steel staff, and then followed it by the silver catheter, or else performed perineal section at the time, and emptied the bladder by a full- sized gum catheter, and left it in for some hours. The latter method is rendered imperative in some cases by the viscid or

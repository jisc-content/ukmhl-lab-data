It now ouly remains for me to describe the two forms of the mesial operation, which I must do very briefly. The simple Mesial Operation of Lithotomy is performed as follows :—A staff somewhat similar to that used in the bilateral operation is intro- duced into the bladder, and given in charge to an assistant, and the patient is then secured in the usual manner. The surgeon commences his incision about an inch and a half in front of the anus, exactly over the central line or raphe, and continues it back till within a few lines of the anus. This incision is carefully deepened anteriorly until it exposes the posterior part of the accelerator urinse muscle covering the bulb, and the posterior fibres of that muscle are divided in the middle line, and the bulb pressed forwards and guarded by the finger, the rectum pressed backwards, and the finger feels for the staff in the mem- branous part of the urethra. The point of a narrow knife is now entered into the groove of the staff, with the back of the blade directed towards the rectum. When the knife is felt to have entered the bladder, the cutting edge is turned back towards the lower surface of the prostate, and carried down through the substance of that gland exactly in the middle Hne, the rectum being at this stage protected, and pressed back with the fore- finger of the left hand. The wound is next dilated with the finger, and when the stone is felt the staff is withdrawn, and the forceps or scoop introduced and the stone extracted. In some

LECTURE CIV. (Edema Glottidis : its Nature and Treatment—Croup and Acute LarjTigitis : Similarity of their Symptoms—Pathological Changes in the different Stages of Croup — The Physical Manifestations which accompany them — Treat- ment, Medical and Surgical—Indications and Arguments for and against Tracheotomy—The Proper Time for performing it. The Diseases of the Air-passages may be classified under the two heads of Acute and Chronic. The acute forms include (Edema Glottidis, Acute Laryngitis, and Croup or Cynanche Trachealis. CEdema. Glottidis, as its name implies, consists of an enlargement or swelling of the textures around the glottis, arising from infiltra- tion of serum or sero-purulent matter into its submucous tissue. It is rather the result of various kinds of diseased action than a special disease. It may arise, in cases of Bright's disease, from sudden dropsical effusion into the soft textures about the glottis, or it may occur after cynanche laryngea, from effusion of serum into the loose cellular tissue about the larynx. CEdema glot- tidis may also come on after tonsillitis or scarlatina ; it not unfrequently fol- lows erysipelas ; and is not by any means rare as a result of local irritation arising from mechanical or potential irritants. Thus, the accidental swallowing of foreign bodies, or of the mineral acids, or of boiling water, may give rise to it. In fact, any inflammatory affection of the larynx, tongue, or other parts in the neighbour- hood, may be followed by oedema glottidis. The obstruction to 3 X Fiff. 30.

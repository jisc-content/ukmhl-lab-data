RELATIONS OF DEEP EPIGASTRIC ARTERY. 1183 cord, and crosses over the course of the great epigastric artery (&), running from without inwards, so that the neck of the hernia (a), where it emerges from the deep opening, corresponds at its inner side to the artery, while in the direct inguinal hernia the artery lies to the outer side of the hernia. This used to be considered of great import- ance as regarded the opera- tion. In oblique inguinal hernia the rule was to turn the edge of the knife obliquely upwards and outwards, so as to avoid the deep epigastric artery ; whereas in a direct inguinal hernia, if we divide the stricture by cutting outwards, we would be almost sure to injure the artery, and therefore the surgeon was warned that he must be very careful in deciding whether the hernia be direct or oblique. Sir Astley Cooper showed that practically we only require to divide the few fibres forming the constriction ; and if we carry the knife directly upwards parallel to the mesial line, so as to divide the constriction at its centre, there is no risk of wounding the artery whether the hernia be the oblique or direct form. In regard to the Diagnosis of inguinal hernia, I have already stated the absolute diagnostics of hernia, and these being kept in mind, I have now to bring before yoix what is sometimes termed the differential diagnosis, or the distinction between this form of hernia and other diseases occurring in the regions which it occupies. When the swelling is confined to the inguinal canal, the diseased conditions which are most likely to simulate hernia are, hydrocele of the cord, cystic tumors, or fatty accumulations developed in the canal in front of the cord, or abscess over the cord.

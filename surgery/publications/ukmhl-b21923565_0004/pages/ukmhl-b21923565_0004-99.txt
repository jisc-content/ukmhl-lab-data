CLINICAL CASES AND COMMENTARIES. 1073 diminishing loss of blood—which has been advised and adopted in the removal of tumours from the neck and face—I rejected as worse than useless, as not only incurring unnecessary risk to the patient, but as likely to lead to danger by inducing a false security in the operator, as its ligature could not control the retrograde haemorrhage from the free anastomosis superiorly ; whilst the free incision along the sterno-mastoid enables the assistant to control the carotid trunk quite as effec- tually, should it be necessary. Besides, in such a dissection, wound of the great internal jugular vein is much more likely to occur than injury of the carotid ; and the best means of avoiding either is to disturb the natural relations of the vessels as little as possible, and to dissect with the edge of the knife directed towards the deep surface of the tumour, whilst the assistant insinuates his fingers in the track of the dissection, so as to protect the vessels. I decided, after clearing the tumour from the great vessels, to dissect the rest of the cervical portion from below upwards, so as to avoid injury to the plirenic nerve : and then to proceed with the dissection of the facial portion from above downwards and backwards, so as to leave the part which felt most fixed in the deep parotid region, and where I expected the largest vessels to enter the tumour, to the last. This plan I carried out, as detailed in the description of the operation, with the able assistance of my colleagues, Drs. Gillespie and Watson ; and I had the satisfaction of removing entirely this enormous tumour, and so relieving my patient from what she and her friends had long regarded as a hopeless dis- ease. In a letter I have received from Mrs. Jepson, dated October 8th, 1863, she says :—" I am happy to inform you that I am in good health; the scars do not look bad ; they are perfectly healed up, and gradually appear less." When I last heard of her, about a year ago, she was quite well, had had two children, and remained free from any appearance of the tumour returning.

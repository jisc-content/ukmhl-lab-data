REGIONAL SURGERY. 1070 cellular slieatlis are not destroyed ; and even if the growth has formed adhesions to the sheath, the vessels themselves are free ; whereas in malignant growths we find no such limitation. On the contrary, the disease often invades all the textures, destroy- ing the cellular sheaths, and involving the vessels and nerves themselves ; and even when the mass of such a tumour is en- closed in a dense cyst, and apparently movable, it is not truly limited ; but the narrow prolongations of the diseased structure dip deeply amongst the textures, and form such connections as to defy any certainty of complete removal, as happened in the cases recorded by J. Bell and Warren, already referred to. In the case of Mrs. Jepson, the originally slow progress of the growth, the comparatively unimpaired state of her general health, together with the appearance of the tumour and the absence of that anxious expression of countenance which marks most cases of malignant cachexy, were all conditions indicative of the simple character of the growth ; whilst the more rapid increase latterly noticed, though a reason for interference, was only what we find in most tumours, however benign, and depends on the enlargement of their vessels, and consequent increase of nutritive supply. So far, then, as the character of the growth was concerned, there was everything in favour of operation, as the tumour was neither likely to involve the neighbouring tex- tures nor liable to recur after removal. The second consideration was, the probable progress of the tumour if left to itself. As yet, neither respiration, deglutition, nor any vital function, had been affected by the growth ; but then it had, of late, begun to increase more rapidly in bulk, and over the most prominent part the skin had a dusky red appearance, which showed a tendency to ulceration ; and when that once commences, even in simple tumours, we know how rapidly they fungatc, slough, and bleed—degenerating locally, and exhausting the patient by discharge and pain—and that their removal then becomes much more difficult and dangerous. Besides, the nutrition of the growth was evidently carried on at the expense of the patient's general health ; for, though not

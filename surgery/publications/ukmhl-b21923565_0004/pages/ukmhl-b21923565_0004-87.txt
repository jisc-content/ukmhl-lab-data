1061 CLINICAL CASES AND COMMENTARIES. Bemarlcs.—It may seem at first sight of little use to leave the mere symphysis remaining, as, when deprived of the support of the lateral portions, it was as likely to be retracted along with the tongue as to prevent that occurrence. The reasons which induced me to leave that portion of the bone were—1st, That it would afford a better hold for the gentleman who assisted me, to prevent retraction during the operation ; 2dly, That when the wound healed it would afford support to the lower lip, and thus in some measure prevent the constant escape of saliva ; and that as it would contract adhesions to the cicatrix, by preserving the attachments of the muscles of the tongue, the patient would be enabled to speak and swallow better than if it had been removed ; and, lastly. By preserving somewhat the appearance of the chin, the operation would be followed by less deformity, and the patient rendered more comfortable; whereas, if the symphysis had been removed, the retraction of the lower part of the face would have been greater, the tongue would have formed adhesions to the fore-part of the lip, and thus, from its pendulous position, have given rise to a constant and profuse discharge of saliva, as was the case in the patient mentioned by Sir George Ballingall, and speech would necessarily have been very indistinct. The result of the case has fully justified these conclusions : there has been no violent retraction of the tongue; the patient is able to speak as well as before the operation; she swallows easily, can shut and open the mouth, and protrude and retract the tongue readily. The escape of saliva when sitting up is very trifling, and is gradually becoming less. A section of the jaw, made by my friend Mr. Goodsir, shows the tumour to be of a dense solid structure except in its centre, where soft degeneration was apparently just com- mencing. The woman lived for fourteen years after the operation, and had a certain amount of power of chewing with the front teeth, so that she could eat animal food. On examination after her death, I found that the space on each side of the symphysis, from which the jaw had been removed, was occupied by a very dense

The employment of caustics in the treatment of stricture was had recourse to in old times, in the first instance, in consequence of the erroneous pathological opinion, that the obstruction was always due to the projection of caruncles or warts from the lining membrane of the urethra, the destruction of these growths being the object aimed at by this plan of treatment. In more recent times, the application of nitrate of silver in the treatment of stricture was revived by John Hunter, and subsequently ex- tensively practised by Sir Everard Home and others. It was first used, not to destroy the contraction, but with a view of allaying the morbid irritability often present in cases of stric- ture. Some forms of stricture are excessively irritable, so that the passage of an instrument invariably gives rise to constitu- tional disturbance, as well as intense pain at the time. Hunter used the nitrate of silver in such cases at first, with the view of exhausting the morbid irritability of the part, and altering the action of the morbid surface, as we do in the case of irritable ulcer. To that extent the treatment was justifiable and useful. It happened, however, that, in some cases in which the caustic had acted more energetically than usual, the contraction was destroyed, and that large bougies could be introduced into the bladder more rapidly than by the ordinary treatment. This led to the caustic or armed bougies being used, so as to effect de- struction of the contraction, as a method of treatment; and this,

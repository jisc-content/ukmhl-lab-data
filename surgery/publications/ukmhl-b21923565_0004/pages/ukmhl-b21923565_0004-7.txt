Practuke of the Upper Jaw is Bot common, except as the result of direct force, such as a blow, or a kick from a horse. In general the injury is easily diagnosed on account of the swelling and the mobility of tlie alveolar process. In a case lately under my care in hospital, there was a displacement which might have given rise to a difficulty in the diagnosis. The case simu- lated one of dislocation of the lower jaw—the molar teeth of the upper jaw were pushed downwards, and did not correspond to those of the lower, the mouth could not be closed, and the lower jaw seemed to project. But it was merely the back part of the lower jaw which was pushed down, and, on examining the parts fully, the injury was easily diagnosed and remedied. The treatment of fracture of the upper jaw is to model the parts into position as far as possible, and then to apply a bandage or handkerchief, to retain the jaws in apposition. Fkactures of the Lower Jaw are very common, and may occur at almost any point of the bone—through the angle of the jaw, for example. Not uncommonly we have a double fracture, the jaw giving way at the angle, and at a point a little to one side of the symphysis on the opposite side of the jaw, or on both sides of the symphysis. lu these cases we find that tlie gum-texture is 3 T

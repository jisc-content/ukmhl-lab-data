EXPLANATION OF PLATES. LIGATURE OF ARTERIES.—Plate XXVIL—Page 649. Fig. 1. Outline figure, showing the lines of incision for exposing the arteries of the arm and forearm. Fig. 2. Lines of incision for exposing the common carotid, third portion of the subclavian, and upper third of the axillary artery. Fig. 3. Incision for exposing the femoral artery at the apex of Scarpa's triangle. Fig. 4. Form of aneurism-needle recommended. Plate XXVIIL—Page 660. Fig. 1. Sketch from nature, showing the parts as seen after performing ligature of the right common carotid artery above the omo- hyoid muscle. Fig. 2. Sketch after ligature of the left common carotid below the omo- hyoid muscle. Fig. 3. Dissected view of the parts concerned in ligature of the carotid, showing the relative anatomy of the artery, vagus nerve and internal jugular vein, when the sheath is removed in front. The small nerve, the descendens noni, is also seen in front, or superficial to the sheath. Fig. 4 shows the incision for exposing the third portion of the subclavian artery. The outer margin of the stemo-mastoid is divided more largely than usual, to exhibit the relative anatomy of scalenus anticus muscle to the artery. The position of the external jugular vein ; posterior belly of the omo-hyoid muscle, trans- versalis colli artery and the brachial plexus of nerves are also seen, the cellular tissue having been dissected away to expose these parts.

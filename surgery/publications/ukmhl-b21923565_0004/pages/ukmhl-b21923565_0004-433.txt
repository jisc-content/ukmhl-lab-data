1391 FISTULA IN ANO. Abscess in the Vicinity of the Eectum was alluded to in the early part of the course, but it is necessary briefly to recon- sider the subject here, owing to its connection with Fistula IN Ano. From some of the local causes of irritation which we have just been considering; from the presence of foreign bodies, such as portions of bone perforating the rectum and lodging in the tissues external to it; exfoliations from the pelvic bones ; or, from a debilitated habit of body, inflammation may be set up in the neighbourhood of the rectum, and result in the formation of abscess in the ischio-rectal fossa. The pus, bounded below by the dense integument of the hip, by the ischio-rectal fascia, and levator ani internally, and the strong obturator fascia exter- nally, makes its way towards the rectum at the inner and lower part of the space where the ischio-rectal fascia becomes thin and cellular immediately above the sphincter ani, and there it undermines, thins, and ultimately perforates the bowel; the abscess very generally opens also towards the integuments of the hip, and so gives rise to sinus or fistula. After evacuation of the abscess, the openings formed, and the tracts or cavities connected with it do not heal, for mucus or thin fjeculent matter or flatus from the gut passes into and keeps up the irritation, and these causes, together with the con- stant movements of the parts affected, prevent the healing process by contraction from taking place, and as a result we have the formation of Sinus or Fistula. The term is used to express that condition which we meet with in cases where the cavity of an evacuated abscess has failed to contract and heal, but where it remains open and continues to pour from its surfaces a thin unhealthy discharge of a gleety or muco-purulent character. Gradually the walls become thickened and callous, the cavity diminished in size, the lining surface smoothly glazed, like a mucous membrane, the discharge lessened in quantity and altered in quality. The action is sluggish, without tendency to heal, and thus the diseased condition becomes established. On introducing a probe at the opening, it is found to pass

Puncture of the Bladder for Eetention of Urine in cases of Stricture—Puncture by the Rectum : by Incision from the Perineum—Extravasation of Urine—Symp- toms of rapid Extravasation from yielding of the Urethra behind the Stric- ture—Treatment—Extravasation resulting from neglected Urinary Abscess— Fistula in Perineo—Different forms of Perineal Fistulse, and their Treatment —Retention of Urine and Catheterism in the Female. Occasionally, but very rarely, cases of retention occur in which the surgeon requires to puncture the bladder. There are two methods of doing this. The bladder may be punctured from above the pubes, as already described when speaking of diseased prostate, or by the rectum in cases where the prostate is of its natural size. The latter is a very simple mode; rather too simple in fact, becaiise some surgeons are much inclined to re- sort to it, rather than persevere in attempts to pass the catheter. In retention of urine from stricture, unless there be absolute destruction of the canal, the surgeon ought always to be able to pass a catheter. If he perseveres skilfuUy, he will hardly ever fail in doing so, though it requires, as I have already shown, some determination and experience. Sometimes it may happen that a person who has had few opportunities and little experience in treating stricture will be called in to a difficult case ; and then, if he cannot obtain further aid, puncture of the bladder by the rectum is certainly preferable to delay, or dangerous efforts with the catheter. When the bladder is distended, and the prostate healthy, the bladder bulges towards the rectum and be- tween the vasa deferentia and vesiculee seminales on either side, there is a point below the reflection of the peritoneum from the rectum to the bladder, where that viscus is in close contact with the bowel. In puncturing the bladder from the rectum, the surgeon

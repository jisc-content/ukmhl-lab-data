REGIONAL SURGERY. 1000 occurring in tliis region, the injuries and affections of the air- passages requiring surgical treatment, and injuries and diseases of the pharynx and gullet. The Tumours which occur in the Cervical Eegion, whether we regard them in reference to operative surgery or diagnosis, and the question of the treatment to be adopted, are undoubtedly amongst the gravest subjects which the practical surgeon has to deal with. It is, however, impossible to do more, in a course of lectures, than to lay down some general principles, and throw out some suggestions, illustrating them by reference to special cases. The circumstances and position of tumours vary in almost every case, and consequently the surgeon in considering their character, symptoms, and treatment, must depend, in each case, on his knowledge of the anatomy and functions of the dif- ferent structures in relation to, or likely to be affected by, the tumour. The tumours we meet with in the neck, besides the important division into simple and malignant, may be sub- divided into those which are new developments,—true tumours, and the enlargements or hypertropliies of natural structures, such as those of the thyroid body. / Of true simple tumours those most frequently met with are the fatty, situated most generally in the submaxillary and lateral regions of the neck, and placed superficially; the fibrous and adenoid growths, occupying, usually, the parotid and deep cervical regions, and having close relations to important parts. The malignant tumours are the different forms of medullary and hard cancer. Perhaps the most important point which the surgeon has to decide, in reference to a cervical tumour, is its nature—whether simple or malignant. If the growth be, from its history and appearance, of simple character, then, however deeply situated, or however near important structures, it is not likely to involve them ; and consequently, although operations for the removal of such deep-seated tumours are perhaps the most difficult in sur- gery, still they may be undertaken with perfect safety and

REGIONAL SURGERY. 1044 the body, if it be witliin the larynx ; and, if he be skilful in the use of the instrument, he may even succeed in extracting it with the laryngeal forceps now employed in removing polypi and other growths from the glottis. Should any circumstance in the case, however, render the trial of this method of extraction inexpedient—as, for example, great irritability of the fauces, or firm impaction of the foreign body below the level of the vocal cords—the surgeon will at least proceed with the greater confi- dence to operative interference when he has ascertained the exact situation in which he may expect to find it. In these circum- stances, when the body is evidently in the larynx, the best treatment would be to perform the operation of laryngotomy, as by this means the surgeon cuts directly down upon the offending substance, making it visible through the incision, and, of course, rendering its removal extremely easy. The operation of Laryngotomy, except in its situation, is very much the same as that of tracheotomy. The superficial incision should be commenced about the middle of the thyroid cartilage, and prolonged downwards in the mesial line to the lower border of the cricoid, and the deep incision is made in the same direction through the crico-thyroid membrane into the larynx ; but in order to get sufficient room, it is frequently prolonged downwards through the body of the cricoid cartilage, or the crico-thyroid membrane may be divided transversely. In the course of the operation the edges of the two sterno-hyoid muscles are separated from each other, and a few veins which lie over the larynx are to be avoided, as they may be sources of bleeding. Some little hsemorrhage may also take place from the small crico-thyroid arteries, which cross the crico-thyroid mem- brane in a horizontal direction, but these seldom give any trouble. I would now, in conclusion, offer a few remarks upon the more impoi'tant operation of Teacheotomy. The operation of tracheotomy is one often spoken of as per- fectly simple and easy, and so it is in many cases ; but even in

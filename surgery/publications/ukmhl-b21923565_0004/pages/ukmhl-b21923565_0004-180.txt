Irreducible Herni^e require to be subdivided according to the causes which oppose their reduction. Thus, a hernia may be irreducible owing to adhesions between the protruded por- tion of bowel or omentum and the hernial sac, which prevent the contents of the sac being returned into the abdomen. In such cases the changes have probably taken place slowly ; and although the protrusion is so far fixed as to prevent its reduc- tion, it is seldom so largely adherent as to prevent the portion of intestine being affected by the peristaltic motion of the bowels ; and so its function, though perhaps somewhat impeded, is not in- terrupted, nor indeed materially affected. The patient may suffer occasionally from irritation in the hernia, flatulent distension and sluggish action of the bowels, but in general there are no marked symptoms connected with this state ; of course the condition of the patient is always extremely hazardous, as he is liable to inflammation, or strangulation of the protrusion being induced by various causes, such as external injuries or disorder of his digestive organs. Secondly, a hernia may be irreducible from some alteration in form and increased deposit of fat in a portion of protruded omentum which has been left unreduced for some time, and has become so altered in form or bulk as to be no longer capable of being returned through the opening by which it had descended. In this case, if the patient applies for surgical aid

REGIONAL SURGERY. 1414 And this leads us to the consideration of what these complica- tions are, and how such difficulties may be best met and overcome. Though I have mentioned the irregularity of the obturator artery as being an obvious and serious complication in the case, it was by no means that which gave rise to the greatest difficulty; —indeed, from my remarks under the first head, it may be seen, that I hold that, except for the other conditions of the hernia, the irregular vessel would not have given rise to much difficulty, or been in much danger of being wounded. The real difficulty which complicated the operation was, I think, the bulky and irregular form of the protruded ccecum ; its comparatively fixed position, by its peritoneal a,ttachments, near the site of the femoral opening; and its posterior cellular con- nections, not allowing it to slip back like a portion of the floating intestine; and last, not least, the state of the bowel, from the previous attempts at the taxis, forbidding all further pressure or manipulation that could possibly be avoided. The form and connections of the ccecum always render its reduction slow and gradual, even under more favourable circum- stances, where the bowel can safely bear moderate compression, and where the constricting textures have been very freely divided,—as I found in a case of inguinal coecal hernia, on which I operated some months ago, where there was no limitation to making the incision of the constriction very free indeed ; and I have also seen the same difficulty, though to a much less degree, in cases where the sigmoid flexure of the colon formed the con- tents of inguinal herniae. In femoral hernia, however, where our incisions must, in general, be much more limited, and, especially, when we have ascertained the presence of an irregular artery round the upper part of the ring, the causes of difficulty I have alluded to become very embarrassing, and require us to adopt great caution in dividing the constricting textures. It was the eccentric pressure of the bulky distended g-ut which brought it into contact with structures which do not ordinarily form the seat of stricture, and in this way the irregular artery, dragged

Passing from the cervical region, I now proceed to consider the Injuries and Surgical Diseases of the ThoraX; and the operations required for their relief. This region, for the purpose of distinction, may be divided into the superficial pectoral, and deep or proper thoracic regions. In the former, I must also include the axillary space situated between the thorax and upper extremity. In the superficial region we meet with a great variety of morbid growths requiring surgical operations for their removal. In the case of axillary tumours, their relation to the important vascular and nervous structures contained in that space renders it necessary that the surgeon be exceedingly careful in his diagnosis and in his operative proceedings, almost as much so as in the case of deep cervical growths. I have had occasion to remove the whole of the great pectoral muscle from its thoracic and clavicular attachments to its insertion into the humerus, on account of a medullary sarcomatous tumour developed in its structure. The coraco-clavicular aponeurosis was almost destroyed by pressure of the growth, and the axillary vessels and nerves were fully exposed during the dissection. In another case, I removed an enormous malignant cystic tumour occupying the axillary cavity, and pushing aside the scapula behind and the pectoral muscles in front. I need hardly say the dissections in such

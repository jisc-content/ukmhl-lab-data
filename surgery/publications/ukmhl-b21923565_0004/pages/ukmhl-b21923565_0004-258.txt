LECTURE CXVII. Operations for the Eemoval of Vesical Calculi—Lithotrity and Lithotomy : the Cases most suitable for these Operations—Preliminary Exploration of the Bladder, or Sounding—Lithotrity. There are two great methods of getting rid of stone in the bladder, Lithotomy and Lithotrity, each method being more suitable for certain cases than for others. When lithotrity can be performed in cases where everything is favourable for it, there is no doubt that the operation is one attended with less risk to life than lithotomy ; but then, unfortunately, it happens that the cases suitable for lithotrity are compara- tively rare. In private practice, among the better class of patients, lithotrity can be performed much more frequently than in hospital practice ; for in the former the patient generally applies to a surgeon early, whilst the stone is still small and friable, and before its presence has excited chronic vesical irrita- tion, and when it can therefore be crushed under the most favour- able circumstances. But there are certain conditions which must be attended to in deciding which is the preferable operation in each individual case. What then are the conditions favour- able for the performance of lithotrity ? First, the stone must be of a small size, or at all events not large ; it must also be of a somewhat friable composition, and likely to yield readily to the crushing instrument introduced into the bladder per urdhram, because the force we can employ is limited by the size of the canal. The stone should be friable in a particular way. It should break up readily into small fragments or sand. The oxalate of lime calculus is not friable in this way ; it breaks rip into a number of smaU sharp fragments, which are not easily broken up completely, and these sometimes get impacted in the urethra, and cause a great deal of trouble and danger ; hence

SYMPTOMS OF STRANGULATIOlSi. 1157 may undergo marked remissions ; it may be present at first, and then become less violent, so that we might think the patient somewhat better ; but this often depends on the stomach being empty, and vomiting returns if liquid or solid food be taken. Then the symptoms become more serious. The tumour be- comes less painful, perhaps, but the integuments covering it become of a dusky red hue ; the abdomen becomes more tympa- nitic ; the pulse small and irregular ; and the vomiting changes in character. At first the matter vomited may be greenish in colour, but ultimately the contents of the gut are vomited, and —from the arrested peristaltic movements—faeculent vomiting takes place. The upper portion of the bowel is obstructed from the first. Occasionally, when the portion of intestine which has been strangulated is very high up, we may have the appearance of bilious stools even when in reality strangulation is most com- plete ; but this is not common. When the bowels have been emptied at first, we find that nothing more passes, for nothing can pass from above the constric- tion, unless in cases where only a portion of the canal of the gut is constricted. The skin gets cold and clammy, the features become sharp ; there is constant hiccup, and, unless relieved by operation, the patient dies from gangrene of the intestine, with all the symptoms of collapse. Before this takes place, however, the local symptoms are usually well marked. Emphysema takes place under the skin, the tension becomes diminished, and the tumour feels doughy or emphysematous. The bowel gives way into the sac, and unhealthy sero-purulent matter forms in the subcutaneous tissue over the hernia. These are the typical symptoms of a hernia passing from the state of acute incarcera- tion to strangulation. We may also have all the violent and

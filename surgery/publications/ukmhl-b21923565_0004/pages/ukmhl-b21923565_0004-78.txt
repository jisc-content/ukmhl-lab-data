Of these, two pairs, the blades of which open in dif- ferent directions, are ^ generally required, so as to adapt them to seize the foreign body according to the posi- tion in which it may be. These forceps should always be used with great care, so that the foreign body may not be pushed downwards, if its ex- traction be at all pos- sible. When a smooth rounded body, such as \\ a coin, has entered in- to the stomach, we, of course, desire to get it evacuated by the bowels as speedily as possible. Our object is to accelerate as much as possible the passage of the foreign body through the in- testine, so as not to afford time for permanent lodgment. This can be best accom- plished by giving, in addition to bulky farinaceous food, gentle laxatives, such as small doses of castor-oil; after two or three of which the foreign body is generally passed along the small intestine very readily.

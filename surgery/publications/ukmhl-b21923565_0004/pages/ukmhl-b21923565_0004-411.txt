IRRITABLE TESTICLEâ€”ELEPHANTIASIS SCROTI 1369 Neuralgia of the Testicle, or Irritable Testicle, is an excessively painful affection, but scarcely admits of surgical treat- ment. Castration has occasionally been had recourse to as a last resource, when the intensity of the suffering was unbearable, but the remedy is hardly warrantable, for 4;he relief is only tempor- ar}^ The divided cord becomes the seat of neuralgic pains, or the opposite testicle is soon affected ; and in some few cases, where the painful symptoms were cured, the patients, forgetting their former sufferings, have reflected on the surgeon for yielding to their importunities for relief and removing the testicle. The remedies most generally useful as palliatives are the application of blisters over the lumbo-sacral region, the cold douche to the spine, and cold baths to the genital organs, together with proper constitutional treatment by means of chalybeates and quinine, and taking great care to prevent accumulation of fseculent matter in the large intestine. In some cases marked benefit follows the use of Lallemand's cautery applied to the prostatic portion of the nrethra. Hypertrophy or Elephantiasis of the Scrotum, though of rare occurrence in this country, is occasionally met with, and in warm climates the affection is not uncommon. The whole integuments of the scrotum are swollen, thickened, and altered in structure, so as to form an enormous tumour, in which the penis and testicles are deeply imbedded, the integuments of the prepuce, hypertrophied and covered with indurated excres- cences, alone remaining visible, as shown in the woodcut on the following page. In such cases the only remedy is removal of the whole tumour, which, as it is a simple hypertrophy, lias no tendency to return. Such operations are attended with great risk from the immediate loss of blood, and therefore, except when the tumour is comparatively small, it is scarcely admissible to attempt any dissection for the purpose of saving the genital organs, but to proceed more summarily to complete ablation of the mass by a stroke of the long amputating knife.

1198 REGIONAL SURGERY. unoccupied. Tliis space is bounded on the inner side by cres- centic fibres from tlie crural arch and from its falciform process, and also fibres from the lower pillar of the external oblique tendon and conjoined tendons, passing down towards the pubes, and towards the spine of the pubes, forming Gimbernat's liga- ment, or the crescentic margin of the crural arch. Behind, we have the pubes, covered by the pectineus and fascia ; and in front we have the crural arch formed by Poupart's ligament and the abdominal fasciae. The space so bounded is one of the weak points of the abdominal walls; it is merely closed internally by a deli- cate layer of tissue derived from the transversalis fascia, called the internal cribriform fascia. There is often a sort of indentation corresponding to the space, which is fUled by a small, deep, absorbent gland. This is the only point where a femoral hernia can protrude. The protrusion passes down on the inner side of the sheath of the vein, and passes through the crural ring or canal, which is bounded in front by the crural arch, internally by Gimbernat's ligament or cres- centic margin of the arch, behind by the fascia iliaca, and on the outer side by the sheath of the femoral vein. (Fig. 38.) Through this ring or space the hernia passes down and appears in the thigh, immediately below and behind the falciform edge of the fascia lata, which is stretched in front of it, and it lies upon the pubic portion of the fascia lata. The hernia is covered in this region by the cribriform fascia, the thin upper portion of which it either distends and carries before it, or it sometimes dilates and passes through one of the foramina in that structure. The relations of tliis cribriform fascia should be carefully studied, and

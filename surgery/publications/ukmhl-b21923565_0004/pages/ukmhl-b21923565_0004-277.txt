SURGICAL ANATOMY. 1245 branous portion of the urethra, and is occupied by the muscular fibres of the compressor urethrse, and a plexus of veins, whilst, about 16 lines in front of the anus, the artery of the bulb runs across the space from without inwards, close to the anterior layer of fascia, and immediately below it, and close behind the bulb, the ante-prostatic or Cowper's gland is situated. If, at this stage of the dissection, we mark a line beginning about an inch and a quarter in front of the anus, close to the raph^, and passing obliquely downwards and outwards about midway between the anus and tuber ischii, we indicate the line of incision in the lateral operation of lithotomy, and we see the parts which must be divided to reach the triangular ligament. If the posterior margin of that fascia be lightly touched with the knife, and the finger entered deeply about the middle of the line of the incision, and directed upwards and to the central line of the peri- neum, as if to reach the subpubic arch, the groove of the staff will be felt in the membranous part of the urethra, and you will notice that the artery of the bulb lies anteriorly and superficially to the part of the urethra into which the knife should be entered. If, on the contrary, you were to cut the triangular ligament as far forwards as the extent of your external incision, you would be very likely to divide the artery of the bulb. If you now examine the mesial line of the perineum, you will perceive that whilst it is the shortest and most direct route to the neck of the bladder from the perineum, there is only a very short space between the bulb and anus, and that this space diminishes between the bulb and rectum, as we pass upwards. Indeed, in many subjects, the bulb completely overhangs the membranous part of the urethra. At the same time, however, you will observe that no important structures occupy the recto-urethral space, that the rectum can be easily pressed back, and that by dividing the muscles and other textures connected at the central point of the perineum, and by bulging forwards the convexity of the staff, the membran- ous urethra can be made easily accessible. Still, the mesial inci- sion must necessarily be limited as compared with the lateral,

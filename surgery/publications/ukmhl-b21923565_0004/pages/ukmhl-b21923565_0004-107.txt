CLINICAL CASES AND COMMENTARIES. 1079 very cautiously, for two reasons : first, the great vein might b.e partly involved or displaced by the tumour, and thus liable to be wounded at some unexpected part; and secondly, by the absence of the vein the sympathetic nerve and thoracic duct were left uncovered, and these important stnictures, undistin- guishable amongst the tissues discoloured by blood, were exposed to great risk of injury. The phrenic nerve, from its white colour and comparatively superficial position, was easily enough seen and guarded. Indeed, the absence of the vein from its natural posi- tion, and the uncertainty as to whether it might be displaced, I consider the most embarrassing condition in the operation. In describing the operation, I have stated that on dissecting the flaps from the surface of the iipper part of the tumour I tied a large vein, which I was inclined to think was the displaced internal jugular vein ; and my reason for supposing this, was, that the vessel could be traced from the angle of the jaw passing downwards over and partly in a groove on the surface of the tumour in relation with the deep surface of the sterno-mastoid, and very much in the line of the jugular ; but as it was obliter- ated about the middle of the neck its continuity could not be traced lower down. The pervious portion was about the bulk of the forefinger, and full of blood for about two inches, when it became a flattened cord. I should presume, from the relations of the tumour, that it had probably originated at an earlier age even than that stated, viz. the third year, -when it was first noticed by the patient's friends, and that it had developed itself from above downwards, and thus insinuated itself between the parts which usually occupy the common sheath, raising the vein on its surface and pressing the artery and vagus inwards, before its bulk overlapped them. I draw attention to this point, because it is well to be prepared for similar difficulties ; and I believe that the history of the case may guide us, as these ana- tomical relations seem to me to depend specially on the original position and development of the growth in early life, before the cellular texture of the common sheath has become condensed, and are not likely to be met with in cases where the tumour

I would do so even although there were enlarged glands in the groin; and from what I have seen I would not despair of success in arresting the ulceration, for I have great belief in the doctrine that cancroid disease, arising from a local cause, is seldom truly malignant as regards the constitution; and at all events, by such procedure as I advise, we can hardly make matters Fig. 48. merely been affected sympatheti- cally.

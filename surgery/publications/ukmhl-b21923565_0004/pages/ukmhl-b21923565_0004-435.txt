FISTULA IN ANO : TREATMENT. 1393 or lip to the orifice. Into this opening the probe is passed, the forefinger of the left hand being at the same time inserted into the rectum. By means of the probe we ascertain the extent and direction of the sinus, and by means of the forefinger being gently opposed to it from within the bowel, we search for an opening, through which, if it exist, we can readily pass the probe. If there be no internal opening present, we ascertain the part of the bowel which has become most attenuated by the diseased action. Besides the fistu.la proper, there are often numerous sinuses passing in different directions towards the hip and perineum. The Treatment will depend greatly upon the nature of the case. If you have been able to discover an internal openmg, and have had great difficulty in finding it, you will do well not to withdraw the probe, but to retain it, and introduce a bistoury into the bowel, and cut out the probe. Thus, the intervening septum between the bowel and the cavity of the sinus will be laid freely open, and the diseased surface will gradually contract, granulate, and heal. If the internal opening be easily found, you may withdraw the probe, and introduce in its stead a probe- pointed curved bistoury; although I consider it advisable to bend and leave in the probe in all cases, to ensure complete division of the septum. The probe point of the bistoury is Fig. 52. pressed against the point of the finger within the bowel, and both are withdrawn. Thus you will make a simple clean cut through the intervening textures constituting the septum, and leave the surfaces to granulate and heal. Should you fail to

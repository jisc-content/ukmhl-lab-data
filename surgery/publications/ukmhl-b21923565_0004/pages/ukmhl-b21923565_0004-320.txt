In to-day's lecture I begin the consideration of those diseases of the urinary organs which present the common symptom of retention of urine. Eetention of Urine may arise from various causes, mecha- nical and constitutional. A direct mechanical obstruction is sometimes met with in the shape of a calculus impacted in the urethra, which effectually prevents the flow of urine. This often occurs in children as well as adults, and the accompanying symptoms are severe in direct proportion to the size of the stone. In children the calculus is generally small, and— owing to the great contractile power of the bladder, and direction of the urethra—it is generally projected far forward by the force of the urine—whence it is only prevented from being completely ejected by the narrow orifice of that canal. In treating such a case it is necessary, in order to remove the foreign body, to press it forwards towards the orifice of the urethra, and then if possible to expel it. If the orifice be too small to allow of this, it should be slit open, and the calculus then removed, after which the urine will flow freely. In the event of the textures being divided, it is necessary during the after-treatment to pass a catheter occasionally, so as to prevent the parts from contracting too much during the healing process. In the case of an adult, owing to the direction and curvature of the urethra, a calculus generally becomes impacted at a more

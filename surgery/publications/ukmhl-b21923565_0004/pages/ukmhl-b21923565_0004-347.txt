1307 DIAGNOSIS OF STRICTURE. supplying the bladder and adjacent pelvic viscera, giving rise at first, by reflex action, to functional, but, unless cliecked, ulti- mately leading to organic alteration in the medulla spinalis. The symptoms of this condition are very alarming, simulating as they do those of incipient paraplegia, and in some cases culminat- ing eventually in that condition. Thus, vre have neuralgic pains in the lower extremity, and also in the lumbar region, cramps or spasmodic twitches of the lower limbs, especially when in bed, a feeling of dull weight and constriction over the lower part of the abdomen, and gradually increasing weakness of the lower limbs. It is of course quite possible that chronic disease of the medulla spinalis may occur coincidently with stricture or vesical affection ; but, in the cases I refer to, the symptoms are pro- duced, in the first instance, reflexly, and depend, as I have said, on long-continued irritation of the branches of the lumbo-sacral plexus, and also of the organic nerves of the hypogastric region. The chronic congestion of the vessels of the pelvis and neigh- bouring parts will also conduce to give rise to this condition. When these symptoms, therefore, arise in cases of stricture, we are, I think, warranted in forming a more favourable prognosis, as the morbid conditions with which they are connected are, in the first instance, merely functional; and if the treatment of the local affection—the stricture—be successfully carried out, and means taken to allay the irritation of the iirinary organs, and to relieve congestion, the alarming symptoms will disap- pear, and organic changes in the nervous centres will thus be prevented. In regard to the positive diagnosis of urethral stricture, that can only be arrived at by examination by instruments, when carefully and methodically conducted, for all the symp- toms of stricture, whether constitutional or otherwise, depend- ing on the local obstruction, may arise from other causes. In conducting an exploration with instruments, I have said it must be carefully done, and on some fixed principle, for otherwise it is quite possible to be misled by such an examination. Thus', if taking for granted the statements of the patient that he has a stric- 4 Q

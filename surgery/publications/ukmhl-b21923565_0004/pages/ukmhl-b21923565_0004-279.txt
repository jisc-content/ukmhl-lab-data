INCISION OF THE PROSTATE. 1247 also demand our special attention, for the direction and the extent to which we can carry our incision through its substances without dividing that part of its base where the reflection of the fascia takes place, forms one of the most important points in regard to lithotomy. The form of the prostate has been well compared to that of a chestnut. It surrounds the commence- ment of the urethra, at the neck of the bladder. The great por- tion of the substance of the gland lies posterior to the canal of the urethra, about one-third or one-fourth of its substance lying on the anterior or pubic aspect of the canal. The prostate is placed somewhat obliquely, its apex directed downwards and forwards, whUst its body and base rest upon the rectum, the base as it were embracing the neck of the bladder, and con- nected with the vas deferens and vesiculte seminales, whose ducts pass into and through its substance. If we take the measure- ments of the prostate in different directions, we shall find that in the mesial line, from above downwards, from its base to its apex, it measures from twelve to fourteen lines in the adult, and that its longest axis on each side is from the apex, at the mem- branous part of the urethra, obliquely downwards and outwards, which gives a difference of from three to four lines more than the mesial measurement; and this direction is also that in which the incision is least likely to injure the reflection of the ileo- vesical fascia, as it runs lower down and parallel to the line of reflection. Incisions made in similar directions, through both sides of the gland, will of course double the size of the opening in the prostate, and give us the largest aperture we can obtain consistently with the non-division of the base of the gland. But to understand how stones are readily and safely extracted by the ordinary lateral operation, though much larger than we should suppose the opening of the prostate would permit, we must consider the character of its structure. The prostate, in its normal healthy state, is soft and yielding, composed of a congeries of mucous follicles interspersed with a peculiar fibrous structure, which some anatomists consider as mus- cular, and these textures are enclosed in a very thin but

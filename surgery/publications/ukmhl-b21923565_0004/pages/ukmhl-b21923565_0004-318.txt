REGIONAL SURGERY. 1278 mined by the proportion of young patients operated on. If the number of children be large, the results will be proportionately successful. This circumstance, I think, accounts in some measure for the variations of success which, not only individual surgeons, but particular hospitals may experience. In the earlier years of my practice a great many young patients came under my treatment, and for a long time I never lost a patient, but latterly young patients seem to have become scarce, for I find the youngest I have operated on during the last four years was a gentleman thirty-five years of age. If an hospital be situated in the vicinity of what I may term " a stone district," it wUl be most likely to receive a great many more children suffering from calculus than an hospital at a con- siderable distance, for parents are naturally unwilling to be parted from their children under such circumstances. Now that many surgeons in the country operate, comparatively few children with stone are brought to Edinburgh, except from the vicinity; whilst adults still resort to it, for the benefit of surgical aid, from Caithness and other districts where stone is of frequent occurrence. As to the statistics of lithotomy in the future, I am also inclined to think that these will appear less favourable than formerly, because the cases now properly chosen for lithotrity— namely, those in which the stone is small, the bladder not very irritable, and the other urinary organs generally healthy—are just the cases which were the most favourable for lithotomy. Hence the abstraction of such cases wiU diminish the average of suc- cessful results, and make lithotomy appear more fatal than it used to be. I have had no experience of lithotomy in the female, and, as I have already stated, I consider lithotrity as in all respects pre- ferable to lithotomy or dilatation; but in any case of large or hard calculus, where lithotomy is required, the operation is per- formed as follows :—The patient being under chloroform, and held in the ordinary position, a straight grooved staff or director

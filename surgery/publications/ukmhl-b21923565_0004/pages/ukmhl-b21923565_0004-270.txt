REGIONAL SURGERY. 1238 in my opinion, add to the mischief. The safest plan, in such cases, is to push back the fragment into the bladder by gentle pressure with a full-sized catheter, or by a stream of tepid water injected into the urethra. Should the fragment be large and firmly impacted near the sinus of the bulb, I consider that an incision in the middle line of the perineum would be safer prac- tice than attempting its removal by urethral forceps, however ingeniously devised for the purpose. In extreme cases, where one or more fragments have become impacted in the prostatic or membranous portions of the urethra, the mesial or lateral opera- tion of lithotomy should be performed. Such cases, however, must be of very rare occurrence if ordinary precautions are observed.

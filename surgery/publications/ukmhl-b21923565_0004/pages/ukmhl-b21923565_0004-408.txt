REGIONAL SURGERY. 1366 cold I use in all cases of excision of tumours, and find that it obviates oozing of blood, and keeps the local action within due bounds. It must of course be watched as to its effects, for in some instances it may prove too depressing, and interfere with union. Eemoval of a very large tumour of the testicle can be effected easily by a single longitudinal incision of the scrotum ; but it is always, I think, advisable to remove a very considerable portion of integument, to diminish the cut surface left, the number of vessels requiring to be secured, and the risk of re- actionary oozing of blood, whilst the removal of the loose skin also facilitates primary union. Besides tumours of the testicle, properly so called, we meet frequently with simple chronic enlargement of the gland, which in general yields more or less readily to strapping with adhesive plaster, or friction with mercurial and camphor liniment, or iodine liniment, combined with the use of internal deobstruent medicines, such as iodine, or a mild course of mercury. In some instances the swelling is obstinate, and proves a source of annoyance to the patient, and then castration may be war- rantable, but not until a fair trial has been given to other means.

1328 REGIONAL SURGERY. have almost invariably used a gum catheter, and in all cases I leave a plug in the instrument, which can be withdrawn when necessary. Bad results might occur from tying in a full-sized instrument for any cause, if the bladder is permitted to be con- stantly empty, owing to the continuous draining away of the urine. The after-treatment of perineal section is very similar to that of lithotomy casesâ€”anodynes at first, and the free use of dilu- ent drinks, to allay irritability of the bladder. The catheter should be withdrawn at the end of forty-eight hours, or earlier, if it cause much irritation. At the end of ten days a No. 8 or No. 9 catheter should be passed, and then at intervals of eight days, as the wound heals. For the first fortnight the patient should be kept in bed, but after that he may be allowed to sit up, or walk about, unless the wound be irritable. In concluding this important subject, I would briefly state, in a dogmatic form, the methods of treatment I should recom- mend in cases of stricture. 1st. In the simpler cases of non-irritable stricture, and where the patient cannot conveniently be confined to the house, even for a few days, vital dilatation methodically carried out on the principles I have laid down. 2d. In more severe, irritable, indurated, and resilient strictures, I prefer Holt's method of splitting the stricture, as it involves very little risk, is uncomplicated with wound, and is therefore attended with less necessity for confinement in the after-treat- ment. 3d. In tight cartilaginous and irritable strictures, with in- duration in the perineum or abscess, or complicated by fistulous openings, I should recommend perineal section on Mr. Syme's principle.

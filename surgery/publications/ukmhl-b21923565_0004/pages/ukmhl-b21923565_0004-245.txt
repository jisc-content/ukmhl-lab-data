STATISTICS OF HERNIAL OPERATIONS. 1213 canal. It is impossible, however, to describe satisfactorily the details to be attended to in performing these special operations without quoting very largely from Mr. "Wood's work, and as abridged descriptions of such procedures are apt to mislead, I would refer you to Mr. Wood's monograph on the subject for details. I referred at page 1162 to the results of 127 cases of stran- gulated hernia on which I had operated. These results were collected many years ago, and since then I have operated on a large number of hernial cases ; but as I have not been so careful or methodical in noting results as I formerly was, I subjoin the brief summary of cases referred to, as a contribution to the general statistics of strangulated hernia. Summary of 127 Cases of Strangulated Hernia. Nature of Hernia. No. Recovered. Died. Inguinal * 46 38 8 Femoral 77 60 17 Umtilical and Ventral 4 3 1 Total . 127 101 26 Of 46 Inguinal Hemise, 4 occurred m females. „ 77 Femoral „ 14 occurred in males. The Umbilical and Ventral Herniae aU occuiTed in females. Tlie causes of death in the 26 fatal cases were as follows :— In 17 cases the bowel was distinctly gangrenous. „ 7 „ peritonitis had commenced prior to the operation. (Four of these were cases of congenital hernia.) „ 1 „ pysemia proved fatal on the eighth day. „ 1 „ melsena was the cause of death, t 26 ■ The age of patients on whom the operation has been per- formed is not unfrequently made the subject of notice in me- * Of the inguinal herniae, 8 were congenital herniae, and of tliese 4 died. + In this last case the protrusion, a large scrotal hernia, was returned with great °ase by the extra-peritoneal operation, within sixteen hours from the time of its descent; but the patient, before applpng for medical aid, had resorted to most violent efforts ro reduce it.

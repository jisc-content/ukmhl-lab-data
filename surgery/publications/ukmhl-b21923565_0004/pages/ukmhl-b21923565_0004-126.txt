REGIONAL SURGERY. 1098 must always Le a formidable objection to traclieotomy. If par- tially loose, it may be so placed as to act as a valvular obstruc- tion at the lower aperture of the tracheotomy-tube; and if the membrane exist in the complete tubular form, as in that state it is often but loosely attached, it may collapse, on the trachea being opened, and cause immediate suffocation. If I am correct in holding the opinion that bronchitis or crupous exudation, when present to any extent, form objections to tracheotomy, it must be evident that very few of the cases which we see in young children admit of its performance with reasonable chance of success, except at a much earlier period of the disease than is generally thought proper to consider of its propriety in this country. In estimating the success of the operation for croup in France by M. Trousseau and other surgeons, we must keep in mind, not merely the comparatively great success of what has proved by no means so successful an operation in this country : but, taking into account the early stage in which it has often been performed there, we must ask ourselves whether many of the cases might not have recovered under active treatment with- out such a hazardous operation. In very young children, under three years of age, besides other dangers incident to the opera- tion at that period, the bronchitis, which follows the operation, must render the chance of success very small indeed, and-the unfortunate results of such cases often prevent the surgeon being permitted to perform tracheotomy in cases proper for it. As to the question of the propriety of the operation in cases such as that of the child Walker, where the laryngitis sujoervenes during scarlatina, even though the operation, as in his case, may effect all the benefit we could expect in relieving the dyspnoea, the state of the patient in other respects hardly affords much liope of recovery, and we can only regard the operation as a palliative. Viewed merely in that light, however, I think few who have seen a patient struggling in agony for breath would not feel satis- fied even with the temporary relief afforded by the operation in that case ; besides this further consideration, that Avithout it there was no chance for life being prolonged even a few hours.

CHRONIC LARYNGITIS. 1039 the results liave been almost luiiformly successful. I therefore strongly advise that the operation be performed when the con- dition is going on from bad to worse, and when the paroxysms are becoming frequent, even though they be not present when we see the patient; for when spasm is absent, we can give the patient chloroform, and perform the operation easily. We may remove the tube after a little, and if necessary insert it again. The tube, when retained permanently, should have a hole on its convex side, so as to allow the patient to speak. There are some cases of chronic disease of the larynx which are comparatively rare. For example, the Warty Disease,, in which the diagnosis is rather difficult. The patient suspects the diseased condition sooner than the surgeon. He feels something like a small pea or seed hanging in his larynx, and there is irritation and cough. For- merly, when the diseased condition was made out, we performed tracheotomy without hesitation, and removed the ex- crescence ; but now there may not be any necessity for the operation, as a skilful operator with the laryngoscope may some- times succeed in removing them by the mouth with a pair of forceps made for the purpose. There are other conditions of an ano- malous nature requiring tracheotomy. A large tumour of the thyroid body, for instance, may produce spasm of the glottis by irritating the recurrent laryngeal nerve. In one case of this kind the disease disappeared under treatment by blisters locally and iodide of potassium internally; but after two years the patient returned with the tumour as prominent as ever. I then proposed to tap the cyst of the tumour, but before I could do this my house-surgeon was obliged to perform laryngotomy. * Warty disease of the Larynx.

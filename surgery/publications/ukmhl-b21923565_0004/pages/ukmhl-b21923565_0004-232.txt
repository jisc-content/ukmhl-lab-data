REGIONAL SURGERY. 1200 the latter it is not uncommon. When a hernial protrusion passes through the femoral opening, then, from the way in which the cribriform portion of the fascia of the thigh is arranged, the protrusion tends to pass up towards the abdomen, so that it lies obliquely, and resembles in some instances a small inguinal rup- ture, and this flexure of the body of the hernia upon its neck constricts it still further. If we attempt the taxis therefore, whilst the gut is in this position, we will simply bend it further upon itself, and cannot possibly reduce it. We must first bring the body of the swelling in a line with its neck, and the whole into the axis of the opening through which it has passed out. The hernia descends into the thigh through the saphenous opening at its upper part, but the term has given rise to much misappre- hension, for it is sometimes understood to mean the saphenous edge or lower part of the saphenic opening ; that edge is reflected back upon the vein, and therefore a hernia could never pass out there, unless it passed down between the vein and its sheath, and this it is said does happen sometimes, but I have never seen a case of it. At the upper part of the saphenic opening we have the weak point corresponding to the femoral ring, and when a hernia descends, it passes down immediately below the falciform edge, and invariably occupies the inner compartment of the fascial sheath. A hernia which has emerged at the point just indicated, when of small size, passes at first directly down on the thigh, projecting the superficial cribriform fascia, glands, and skin, before it, and forms a small rounded or sometimes a flattened swelling at the upper and inner part of the thigh immediately below the crural arch. As the hernia enlarges, the connections of the cribriform fascia prevent it passing further down the thigh, and so the body of the swelling is pressed up towards the abdo- men, and lies along the line of Poupart's ligamentâ€”its deep surface resting on the fascia of Scarpa, whilst its superficial aspect is in relation with the common superficial fascia of the groin, and the ascent of the swelling is limited above by the angle of union of the fascia of Scarpa with the superficial fascia of the abdomen.

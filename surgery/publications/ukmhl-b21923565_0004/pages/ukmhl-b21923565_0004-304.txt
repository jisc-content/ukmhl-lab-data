REGIONAL SURGERY. 1264 forceps introduced, and the stone extracted, as in the lateral method. I have never performed this operation on the living. In some cases where the stone was large I have divided the right side of the prostate with the probe-pointed bistoury, and in ordinary cases I have found this to answer well enough ; but in a case on which I had to operate lately, where the stone was of a very large size and of a disc-like or circular form, lying across the cavity of the bladder, which it nearly filled, I found great difficulty in seizing and extracting the stone, even after free division of the right side of the prostate and enlargement of the lateral incision, owing to the obliquity of the stone in reference to the lateral incision ; and I feel satisfied that the bi- lateral operation, with the external incision somewhat modified, would render the grasping and removal of the stone much easier. Moreover, I think every surgeon who has had to enlarge the prostatic incision, by cutting the right side of the gland with the probe-pointed knife, must have felt a want of certainty as to the exact extent and direction of this second in- cision ; whereas the double lithotome, as now improved, makes a perfectly smooth incision, passing equally through each side of the gland obliquely downwards and outwards in its longest diameter. My objection to the external incision of Dupuytren's method is, that it really does not correspond to the prostatic incision, is very limited in extent, and does not afford a free exit for the urine. The semilunar incision no doubt is intended to present two dependent points at the horns of the crescent; but if we look at the external incision when completed on the sub- ject, or in the representation given of it in the posthumous work of Baron Dupuytren, edited by M. Sanson, we see that the wound is no longer crescentic, that the skin towards the anus stretches across in a straight line forming the chord of the arc, so as to prevent the urine escaping readily. Were I to perform the bilateral operation, I should begin the external incision about an inch in front of the anus, and then carry it obliquely down- wards and outwards, as in the lateral operation, first on the left

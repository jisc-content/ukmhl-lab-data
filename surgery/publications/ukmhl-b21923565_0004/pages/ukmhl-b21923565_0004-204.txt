LECTUEE CXIII. Complications met with in cases of Hernia before and after Eeduction—Illustra- tive Cases—Precautions in operating which they suggest—Special Herniae, and their Treatment—Inguinal Hernise: Direct and Oblique—Differential Diagnosis. I HAVE now brought amder your notice the usual patho- logical conditions in cases of hernia, and the general principles on which the treatment of these conditions should be conducted ; but before proceeding to the consideration of special herniae, I must refer briefly to some complications, occasionally met with, which may render our diagnosis as to strangulation of the pro- trusion, and consequently our decision as to the line of practice to be adopted, more difficult. Some of the conditions which may cause doubt as to the nature of a swelling occupying the position of a hernia, such as hydrocele of the cord in inguinal, and en- larged glands in femoral hernia, I have already alluded to, and they will require to be noticed when speaking of special hernise. At present I shall confine myself to noticing two conditions— 1st, Cases of old irreducible hernia, in which symptoms usually indicative of strangulation occur. 2d, Cases in which symptoms of strangulation continue, after a hernia seems to have been fairly reduced by taxis. The former condition is that in which there is most diffi- culty in deciding as to the symptoms depending on strangula- tion. One of the conditions which enables the surgeon to decide and act promptly, by operating early, in an ordinary case of strangulated hernia, is, that hitherto the rupture had always been reducible by taxis, but has become suddenly irreducible, and is accompanied by symptoms more or less urgent. This can only be accounted for by constriction of the protrusion;

1058 REGIONAL SURGERY. simple form. It is not so much a stricture, properly speaking, as a cancerous tumour filling up and leading to obstruction of the oesophagus. It is usually placed either opposite the manu- brium of the sternum or close to the cardiac end of the stomach, and is more common in the latter position. Should the history and appearance of the patient point to malignant disease, instrumental interference is useless and hurt- ful. The occasional passage of bougies or the tube, may be re- quired to introduce food, but their continued regular passage, as in simple stricture, for the purpose of dilatation, not only excites the disease to greater activity, but often causes serious hae- morrhage. The treatment is wholly palliative. To perform gas- trotomy in such cases- would be absurd, and would bring little credit to surgery. In one patient attending the hospital just now, with malignant disease at the cardiac extremity of the stomach, it is curious that the passage of an instrument relieves rather than excites the disease. Simple organic stricture is treated by the passage of bougies, and if necessary, a tube to introduce food into the stomach. The bougie should be of gum-elastic, and should be allowed to remain in for a few minutes. The size should be gradually increased every four days, unless this excites too much irrita- tion. The irritation at first caused by the instrument ceases as the stricture dilates. The process of dilatation must be a gradual one, and therefore bougies should not be passed too frequently. After the dilatation has been fully accom- Fig. 33. plished, it is advisable to pass a bougie occasionally to prevent risk of recurrence of the contrac- tion.

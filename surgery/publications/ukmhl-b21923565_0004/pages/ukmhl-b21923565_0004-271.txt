LECTUEE CXVIIL Lithotomy—Supra-pubic, or Higli Operation—its Dangers, and Proposals for diminisliing them—Steps of the Operation—After-Treatment—Sub-pubic or Perineal Lithotomy—Different Methods—Anatomy of the Male Perineum with reference to Lithotomy. I SHALL now describe to you as succinctly as I can the prin- cipal methods of performing Lithotomy, or the operation of cutting for stone. The methods of performing the operation of lithotomy may be first classified under two great divisions—Supra-pubic and Perineal Lithotomy. The former, or High Operation, is never now performed except as an operation of necessity. In cases where there is any deformity in the bones of the outlet of the pelvis, or where the stone is excessively large, so that it cannot be extracted through the lower outlet of the pelvis, the high or supra-pubic operation is the only means of relieving the patient. It has, however, been proposed in such cases, rather to cut into the bladder by the lateral operation, and introduce a powerful crushing instrument, so as to break up the stone in the bladder when it is so large that it cannot be extracted in the usual way. The supra-pubic operation has this great disadvantage, that, whenever the bladder is opened, it subsides behind the pubis, and the urine tends to infiltrate into the loose sub- peritoneal cellular tissue of the pelvis. To obviate this a variety of methods have been proposed. Some recommend an incision to be made in the perineum opening into the mem- branous portion of the urethra, and a tube or catheter in- troduced into the bladder, to give a free dependent opening for the urine to escape, and so prevent, or at least diminish

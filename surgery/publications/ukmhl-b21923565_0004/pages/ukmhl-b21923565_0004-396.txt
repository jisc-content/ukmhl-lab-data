During fhe progress of gonorrhoea the irritation caused by the disease may induce tlie affections of the prepuce, termed phymosis and paraphymosis; but as these conditions arise also from other causes, we may as well consider them in their general character. The condition termed Phymosis consists in the prepuce being elongated, closing in the glans penis, its orrfice being contracted and thickened, so that it cannot be drawn back to uncover the glans. Phj'mosis frequently occurs in children as a congenital condition, and is, ex- cept under some accidental circum- stances, unattended by swelling or inflammation. But when it super- venes on gonorrhoea or syphilis, the prepuce is swollen, hard, and its margin slightly oedematous. In such circumstances, by the use of acetate of lead lotion, and injecting tepid water beneath the prepuce,the swelling diminishes, and the glans penis can be exposed. If this condition, however, has been permitted to exist till consolidation of the inflammatory swelling has taken place, the discharge is apt to collect beneath the pre- puce, and give rise to abrasion of the opposed surfaces, and partial adhesion may take place between the glans and lining

REGIONAL SURGERY. 1084 Remarhs.—-In reflecting on the case wliicli I have just detailed, some phenomena of a very unusual kind present them- selves. In the first place, when we regard the history of the case given by the child's mother, the sudden manner of the attack, together with the urgent symptoms of asphyxia when first seen, and the almost immediate relief afforded by opening tlie trachea, although no foreign body was expelled ; and if we add to this, that while the child breathed freely through the tube, both sides of the chest seemed to expand equally, and at the same moment; but that, on the other hand, whenever the tube was removed, and the opening in the trachea closed, difficult respiration ensued—I think few medical men would hesitate to pronounce as their opinion, that the foreign body was entangled in the larynx ; and yet the case just narrated affords an example of all these symptoms being present, whilst the foreign body was impacted in one of the ramifications of the bronchus. It may indeed be urged, and I confess I cannot quite divest myself of the idea, thafe the foreign body was in the larynx when the child was first seen, and liad thus given rise to tlie very urgent symp- toms which led me to operate ; and that, owing to the struggles of the cliild during the operation, it had been dislodged from the larynx, and j)assed into the bronchus. Still, allowing this sup- position to be true, it leaves unexplained the cause of difficult respiration which constantly ensued on withdrawing the tube, and closing the opening in the trachea. This is perhaps the most pecu.liar feature of the case ; and I can only attribute it to the irritation caused by tlie presence of the foreign body being conveyed along the nerves distributed on the mucous lining of the bronchus and trachea, towards the larynx, and so exciting spasmodic action of the muscles which close the glottis. Last, but not least in point of practical interest, is the imusual situation of the foreign body in this case ; for, so far as I am aware, there is no case recorded in which a large-sized foreign body has found its way into the left bronchus. Indeed, most writers on the subject speak of the foreign body passing down into the right bronclms, as if it were a constant rule.

In Wounds of the Abdomen, as in those of the chest, the danger is great in proportion as the wound is penetrating or superficial; but even in a wound of the abdominal parietes, at certain points there are special risks. Along a certain line we have the branches of the internal mammary artery, and, lower down, the great internal epigastric artery, which may be injured in a non-penetrating wound of the abdomen. The blood may become effused between the fascia transversalis and the peritoneum, or into the sheath of the muscles, and thus a very large amount of blood may be lost, sufficient to de- bilitate or even to cause the death of the patient. In such cases, of course, the state of the wound, its direction, the general symptoms of haemorrhage, and the peculiar, low state of the pulse, would indicate what had happened, and then we should enlarge the opening, so as to get at the bleeding point, and secure the vessel by ligatures. Where the wound is non-penetrating, and no great blood- vessel is wounded, there is still another risk, not immediate, but secondary — the risk that, from the weakening of the abdominal parietes, a traumatic hernia may occur afterwards. The abdomen may be wounded, the wound dividing the fibres of the external and internal oblique and transversalis muscles.

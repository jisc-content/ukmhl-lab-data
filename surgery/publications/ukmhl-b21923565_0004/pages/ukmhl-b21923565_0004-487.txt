For my own part, I confess that I have always found more interest in, and more direct instruction from, discourses or lectures on Surgery, than from the systematic treatises, however elegant the composition of the latter. In teaching, I have adopted what may by many be considered too dogmatic a method ; but the necessity for this has been long impressed on me by experience as a Teacher and as an Examiner at different Medical Boards. The multiplicity of subjects which engage a Student's attention leaves him but little time to weigh and decide controverted points, even supposing him to possess the knowledge requisite for such decision, and hence I think he has a right to look to the Lecturer for distinct definite instruction, founded on a fair and truthful digest of his own experience.

1192 REGIONAL SURGERY. the tunica vaginalis, as you are aware, are originally one con- tinuous serous sac. As the tunica vaginalis descends into the scrotum, the portion passing through the canal becomes nar- rowed, and bulges out when it emerges into the scrotum; thus two serous sacs are formed, connected by a narrow canal, which continues pervious till the birth of the child, when in general the communication becomes obliterated. It is usually said that the tunica vaginalis is drawn down into the scrotum as the testicle descends, but the tunica vaginalis is generally in the scrotum before the testicle comes down. When this continuity between the peritoneum proper and the tunica vaginalis con- tinues after birth, if the canal does not become obliterated, then there is a narrow communication between the abdomen and the tunica vaginalis along the cord. A hernia or portion of bowel may descend through this narrow canal into or towards the cavity of the tunica vaginalis, and this is what constitutes a congenital inguinal hernia. The testicle is very often found lying in the canal, and the cord shorter than usual. When the hernia descends into the scrotum in such a case, the tunica vaginalis forms the sac of the hernia. In many cases, a portion of gut merely protrudes through the lower opening of the canal of com- munication just within the tunica vagi- nalis in the scrotum. The resistant cha- racter of the canal through which it has passed prevents more passing down, and in such circumstances there is a difficulty in the diagnosis. In a strangulated congenital hernia, where we can see and feel fluid within the scrotum, with pain in the lower part of the abdomen, we may find nothing but what seems to be a thickened cord ; yet, in some of these cases, we find that what appears to be a swollen spermatic cord is really a portion of in- testine contained and constricted within the canal, and often tightly strangulated.

Diflferential Diagnosis of Herniae continued—Diagnosis between Hernia and In- flammation of the Descending Testicle in Cliildren or Adolescents : between Hernia and Hydrocele, Hsematocele, Cirsocele, and Special Tumours of the Cord and Testis—Keduction of ObHque and Direct Inguinal Hernia by Taxis and by Operation in Adults and in Cbildren—Modifications of Oblique Inguinal Heruise—Congenital—Infantile. There is one condition likely to simulate an inguinal hernia in the canal, which I have purposely refrained from speak- ing of, that I might draw your attention specially to it, as I have seen errors of diagnosis occur which might have led to very serious risk. I allude to cases in young children or adolescents, in whom the testicle has not descended into the scrotum. In such instances, from injury or some in- definite source of irritation, it sometimes happens that the testicle becomes inflamed and swells, and becomes as it were compressed or almost strangulated by the dense structures bounding the canal. Under these circumstances there is a tense and excessively tender elongated swelling, occupying the canal and bulging the intercolumnar fascia at the external ring ; and along with these local conditions there are severe constitutional symptoms, vomiting, tenderness, and swelling of the abdomen, frequently constipation, and invariably a great amount of fever. The coincidence of such symptoms with tense, tender, and irreducible swelling in the inguinal region, excite suspicion of strangulated hernia ; and even when, from examination of the scrotum and the history of the patient, you arrive at the conclu- sion as to the true nature of the case, still you will oiten feel anxious lest there may possibly be some hernial complication ; and this, more especially, if the bowels do not act under the effects of medicine. In such cases you must take into account

1357 ORCHITIS: TREA TMENT. rhoea ttan from any other. I have already described the mode of invasion and character of its symptoms when it results from gonorrhoea, and as these are the same from whatever cause the disease arises, I need not repeat them here, but shall simply state the treatment most suitable for its cure. The plan of treatment most generally useful is to deplete at the first by opening one or two of the small scrotal veins, and im- mersing the testicle in moderately warm water to encourage the bleeding, which is afterwards arrested by a bit of adhesive plaster, and the patient is made to remain in the recumbent posture, with the scrotum supported on a cushion, while lint dipped in slightly tepid anodyne lead lotion is applied over it. The bowels should be kept gently open, and the diet should be strictly antiphlogistic. If the disease occur during retrocedent gonorrhoea, all specific remedies should be abandoned, and cam- phor mixture, aerated potash water, and other diluents substi- tuted for them. In many cases effusion takes place into the tunica vaginalis, constituting acute hydrocele, and great relief is given by punc- turing the distended sac, and so relieving tension. In some cases I have made small incisions into the swollen testis, with great relief, and without any bad after effects ; but I have not carried out the practice, as I am impressed with the belief that the risk of exciting irritation more than counterbalances the relief which the incisions afford at the time. In many instances, if we see the case at the commencement, compression of the testicle by me- thodical application of adhesive strapping will often prevent the accession of swelling, and cure the disease; and, in all cases, the strapping applied after the painful symptoms are subdued, is Fig. 44.

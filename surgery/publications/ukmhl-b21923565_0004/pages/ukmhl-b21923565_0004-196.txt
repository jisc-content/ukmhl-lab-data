REGIONAL SURGERY. 1168 any relief from the operation, died -witli intense suffering. When we cut off such a portion of bowel, and divide the constriction at the same time, as the patient is recumbent while a portion of the fluid faeculent matter passes externally, part of it also passes back into the abdomen along the external sur- face of the gut, and so more acute peritonitis is set up. I there- fore divide the constriction freely, and draw down the gan- grenous portion of the gut beyond the stricture, and leave it in the wound, merely covered by lint soaked in warm water. I give the patient an opiate after the operation, and then some hours afterwards I open the gut and cut off the gangrenous portion, so as to allow the faeces to escape. By that time lymph has been effused around the protruded gut, and the risk of fagculent fluid passing back into the abdomen is very miich lessened. I have seen great benefit derived from this method in diminishing pain by obviating acute peritonitis, even though it may not lessen the great mortality after the operation when the bowel is gangrenous. When the state of the bowel is doubtful, which is most frequently seen in femoral hernia, the plan I have adopted for many years to prevent effusion taking place into the abdomen, is to draw the bowel down and examine it as usual, and then simply return it—not into the abdomen—but just within the ring, keeping the doubtful part of the gut opposite the wound, so that I can feel it readily; no dressings are applied on the wound beyond warm-water lint; the patient is placed in bed with the pelvis somewhat raised, so as not to allow the rest of the bowel to drag back the doubtful portion, but this is not very likely to occur, owing to the effusion of lymph which takes place. In many of these cases it happens that perforation does take place afterwards ; generally from the sixth to the eighth day after the operation. The patient is relieved from all the symptoms of strangulated hernia by the operation ; opiates are given to check the action of the bowels at first, but in about a week a small quantity of thin faeculent or bilious matter is dis- charged from the wound, and this gradually becomes more

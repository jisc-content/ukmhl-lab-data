FASCIA OF THE GROIN. 1199 nothing in regard to the anatomy of femoral hernia has puzzled me more than to understand what can be the reason for such diversity of description and views as to the cribriform fascia; for, after many years' experience in dissecting and demonstrating these parts, together with careful examination of them for my own special satisfaction, I have not been able to see any reason for describing this cribriform fascia otherwise than as a continu- ous portion of the fascia lata, always presuming, of course, that no artificial dissection is made to separate the natural connections of the parts. If the subcutaneous superficial fascia be carefully raised, commencing over the saphena vein, and the fat be cleaned away with the handle of the scalpel, so as to expose the saphenic edge, the falciform process, and the fascia lata generally; we see between the falciform edge above, and the saphenic edge in- feriorly, a continuous layer of fascia stretching from the iliac towards the pubic portion of the fascia lata; thinner, perhaps, and reticulated by foramina for vessels, but still perfectly con- tinuous with the two great portions of the fascia. If the handle of the knife or a probe be passed under the saphenic edge, and pressed downwards, it is resisted in its progress, showing that here also, though the edge is abruptly reflected, the membrane is continuous, and above, at the falciform process, where the re- flexion is less sharp, the continuity can be seen. It is only .by artificial dissection that we can destroy this continuity, and make a distinct saphenic opening as it is called. As to the description of its being a portion of the superficial fascia of the thigh, that is evidently incorrect; for the saphena vein, the superficial branches of the common femoral artery, and their accompanying veins, together with the superficial set of femoral glands, form a natural separation between that fascia and the cribriform. As little do I see any reason for considering or describing the cribriform as a distinct structure, for any such distinction must be purely artificial. As the space already described between the iliac vein and Gimbernat's ligament is wider in the female than in the male, femoral hernia is commoner in females than in males, though in

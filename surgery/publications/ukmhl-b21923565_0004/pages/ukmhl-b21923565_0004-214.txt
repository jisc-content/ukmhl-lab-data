REGIONAL SURGERY. 1184 Encysted hydrocele of the cord at its upper part has a very close resemblance to a small inguinal hernia, but there is want of direct impulse, whilst we find irreducibility, tension, fluctuation, and dulness on percussion, without hernial symptoms; when the swelling is prominent, the light test for transparency can some- times be applied. In most cases its defined form, and position in relation to the cord, together with the history and irreducibility, leave little doubt. But if such a case becomes complicated with symptoms of strangulation, there is no safe diagnostic, short of cutting down upon the tumour to make sure; for cases have occurred in which a small hernia had descended behind a hydro- cele of the cord and become strangulated. Encysted tumours in the canal are rare, and when present, their globular form and the cord being felt free above the cyst, the mobility of the cyst, its irreducibility and want of direct impulse, are generally sufficient to settle the question of diagnosis. Fatty masses in the canal are not very common, and when developed high up, so as to cover the cord in the whole length of the canal, they present very much the feeling and character of omental hernia ; indeed, it is almost impossible to distinguish them during life from small irreducible omental hernise. Should symptoms of strangulation occur under these circumstances, and the surgeon cut down upon the swelling and encounter such a defined mass of fat, he must take care not to be thrown off his guard, but should slit up and examine the canal thoroughly, lest a small constricted rupture be also present. Abscesses, acute or chronic, sometimes occur in this region, and I have already spoken of these and their symptoms; but I cannot say that I have ever seen any case where there was difficulty of distinguishing between such abscesses and hernia.

REGIONAL SURGERY. 1106 relation to the subclavian artery and vein At the sternal articulation, the sterno-hyoid and thyroid muscles, and their fascial covering, intervene between the joint and the vessels ; and if the rhomboid ligament, connecting the clavicle with the rib, be thoroughly divided, and the articulation opened in front, we can twist round the articular end of the bone, so that, by keeping the edge of the knife cutting upon it, the remaining texture can be divided without much risk. We may complete the disarticulation with a probe-pointed knife, if that be thought necessary. Keeping in mind these details, the general method of performing the Operation is as foUows :â€”An incision is made upon the clavicle along its whole length, if the entire bone is to be removed; or, in cases of partial removal, to beyond the point where the section of the bone is proposed. At each end of this incision two short perpendicular incisions are made, and the attachments of the sterno-mastoid and trapezius muscles, superiorly, and those of the pectoral and deltoid inferiorly, together with the other soft parts, are dissected from the clavicle. In the case of excision of tlie entire bone, its acromial articulation is opened, and the clavicular attachments of the conoid and trapezoid ligaments divided. Then, by means of a pair of strong tooth-forceps, or the lion-forceps, the acromial end of the bone is elevated, so as to allow the sub- clavian muscles and other deeper attachments of the bone to be safely divided. In this stage of the operation the operator should keep the edge of his knife directed towards the lower surface of the clavicle, so as to cut the textures upon the bone, and avoid risk to the subclavian and supra-scapular vessels, which are in close proximity; and as the textures are divided, the clavicle is gradually drawn more forwards, away from the chest as it were, still further to secure the safety of the vessels. The costo-clavicular ligament, at the sternal end of the bone, must be thoroughly divided, and the sterno-clavicular articula- tion freely opened in front; then, by using the now loosened clavicle as a lever, its sternal articular extremity can be

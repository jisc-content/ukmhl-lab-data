Having directed your attention to the anatomy of the perineum in so far as it is connected with lithotomy, I now proceed to con- sider the different methods of performing that operation. In lithotomy, besides the preliminary treatment common to all great operations, there are some special preliminaries to be attended to. On the day before the operation the patient should have a dose of castor-oil to open the bowels, and, about two hours prior to the operation, an enema of warm water should be administered, to clear out any fseculent matter from the rectum. I generally advise the patient to take a draught of water about half-an-hour before the operation, so as to have a moderate amount of urine in the bladder; but if the patient cannot retain his water, or if the urine is passed as he comes under the influence of chloro- form, the safest plan is to introduce the catheter, draw off the remaining urine, and inject about six ounces of tepid water into the bladder. The patient should be placed on a firm table, about 2J or 3 feet high, and the stool for the operator to sit on should be about a foot lower. In children there is no necessity to tie up the patient, the limbs are held in position by assistants ; but in adults the patient must be properly secured. At one time this was done by means of long bandages, or lithotomy garters, as they were termed, wound round the wrists, hands, and ankles. All that is requisite, however, can be accomplished by the short lithotomy loop or garter represented in Plate liii. Fig. 4, applied

PERINEAL SUTURE. 1381 preferred by some to the silver or copper wire. It is, in my opinion, of very great importance that the upper point of the vaginal wound be thoroughly secured, both that discharges may not enter and hinder union there, but also to prevent passive haemorrhage taking place into the vagina when reaction occurs. To secure this, before tying the other sutures, I take a short curved haemorrhoid needle, armed with fine silver wire or silk, and pass it across the apex of the incision at the highest point, and tie the ligature firmly. In one case, from neglecting this, I had considerable trouble from haemorrhage into the vagina after reaction.

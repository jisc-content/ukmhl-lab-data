TUMOUR OF THE HUMERUS. 37 progress, there would not iinfrequently be an opportunity of afFording effectual relief without resorting to the extreme measure of amputa- tion. Thus, a tumour, the largest it is believed on record, growing from the humerus, which I removed with complete and j)ermanent relief, although weighing nearly foui'teen pounds, left the lower half of the bone perfectly unaltered. It must have commenced in the head, which was expanded into an enonnous mass, of a cup shape, enclosing the glenoid cavity, and neigh- homing part of the scapula, so that in its in- fancy this tumour might certainly have been removed without takinsf off the arm. Indeed, if even a third part of the bone required to be taken away along with the tumour, I should tliink it better to do this than amputate at the joint, since, if the muscles did not shorten sufficiently to restore useful action of the shoulder, the hand and forearm woidd at all events be completely serviceable. Many years ago, a fine healthy- looking boy from Kirkcaldy came under my care, on account of a tumour, the size of a small orange.

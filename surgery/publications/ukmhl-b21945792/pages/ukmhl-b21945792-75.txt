RESTORATION OF THE LOWER LIP. 63 downwards iu this form A to the extent of rather more than an inch, and from each of the lower ends the knife is cm'ved outwards and upwards in a curved line sufficiently far to complete the flaps of this shape which are then raised so that the t^^o straight portions formed in the first instance meet together in the middle line, where they are united by sutm^es, which also maintain all the other cut edges in contact, while the pro- minence of the chin, retaining its natural connec- tions, serves as a support for the new lip. E. B., aged 62, recommended to my care by Dr. Anderson of Selkirk, was admitted on the 9 th of November last, on accoimt of an epithelial cancer, including the whole of the lower lip. On the 21st, I removed the whole of the dis- ease by two incisions from the angles of the mouth, to the prominence of the chin, and from this point cut on each side, at first downwards and outward in a straight line, and then in a curved direction outwards and upwards, so as to free the flaps, which were detached, raised, and united in their proper position l)y silver sutures;

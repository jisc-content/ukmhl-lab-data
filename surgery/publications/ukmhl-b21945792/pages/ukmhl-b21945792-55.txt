AMPUTATION AT THE ANKLE. 43 of my body ou the naked stumjD without incon- venience ; and, with a single stocking over it, am in the habit of walking through the house when my boot is not at hand. The artificial foot I wear, within an ordinary half boot, is made of light wood, with a spring across the part corresponding to the roots of the toes. This spring, however, is of no use, as the rigidity of the boot enclosing it prevents its acting. The foot might as well be made of one piece of wood. At the heel it is hollowed into a concavity, corresponding to the shape of the stump, but rising up before and behind into two pro- longations, which, seen in section, would resemble the horns of a crescent. The foot is cased in shamois leather, which is carried up from the borders of the concavity, and cut into the shape of the upper part of a lady's cloth boot. Like it, also, it is laced up the inner side, and has a tongue; the latter is made of thick soft leather, and is of much service in securing the fitting of the foot. There are no straps or buckles, or steel supports of any kind, nor are they needed. From

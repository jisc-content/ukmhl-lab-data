But, in regard to axillary aneurism, the state of matters is precisely the opposite, since the artery is readily within reach at the seat of dis- ease, and exposed with great difficulty at any part of its coiurse nearer the heart. Thus, it will be found that almost all the earlier operations per- formed on the Hunterian principle for axillary aneurism were mortifying failm'es, and that it has been only since Mr. Ramsden led the way to liga- tm'e of the subclavian at the best place for the pmvpose, that this mode of treatment has proved at aU satisfactory. Even in this improved, or, as it has been thought, perfect state, the operation will be found to have been abundantly fruitful of fatal results, as appears from the researches of Mr. Erichsen, whom all the cases that he could find on record have led to the conclusion that 50 per cent perish from the various effects of hemor- rhage, inflammation, and deep-seated suppuration â€”the true average being obviously much more unfavourable, as the successful are less likely to

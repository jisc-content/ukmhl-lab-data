UNION BY THE FIRST INTENTION. 102 UNION BY THE FIRST INTENTION. In the year 1826 I published a paper on the treatment of incised wounds, with the view of shewing that the method then employed in their treatment was much opposed to primary union. At that time the practice was to close the wound immediately after its infliction by straps of adhe- sive plaster, then to apply a pledget of ointment, and lastly to envelop the part concerned with a long bandage, which was not undone until the fourth day, in order that what was called the ad- hesive inflammation might subside before the first dressing. The imperfections of such a process will appear at once, when the steps by which the adhesion of cut surfaces is accomplished are taken into account. John Hunter erroneously supposed that blood became organized so as to constitute the bond of union; while in more recent times Mr. Paget has fallen into a mistake no less serious b}' denying that there is any \niiting medium at all required.

THE EXCISION OF ENLAEGED TONSILS. 101 from tlie blood trickling into the pharynx and causing the patient to congii. But the latter in- stnmient is still more to be deprecated, since, besides being so difficult to manage in such a nar- row inaccessible space, as to render its perform- ance in most cases little better than a sham or pretence, it is also dangerous, for instead of di-awing the tonsil inwards, and away from the carotid artery, so as to make its excision perfectly safe, as is done by the hook or forceps, it presses the gland outwards and closer to the vessel. It is therefore with no surprise that I have heard of a fatal hemorrhage from this source. Fearing that, through the influence of these faulty means, a most useful operation may again fall into discredit, I beg to enter my protest against any deviation from the old rule of " hamulo exci- pere et scalpello excidere." The best knife for this purpose is a probe-pointed curved bistoury, which, being applied with its convex or blunt edge up- wards, and urged with a sawing motion of its blade downwards, easily and safely accomplishes the object in view.

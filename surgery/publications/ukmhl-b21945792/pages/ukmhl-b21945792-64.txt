EXCISION OF THE ELBOW-JOINT. 52 free access to the joint, but also allows the trans- verse part of the wound tu heal by the fii-st in- tention, and thus prevent the obstacle to mobility, which would result from the process of granulation followed by cicatrization at this part. In cases of anchylosis, from disease, or fracture with dis- placement of the articulating extremity of the humerus, great difficulty was experienced in i"e- moving the mass of consolidated bone, until I adopted the plan of sawing it through transversely at the prominence of the ulna, and then exposing the two surfaces thus obtained, so as to allow the requisite extent of division. In regard to the degTce of mobility attain able, I am led to believe that there exists a great misapprehension, since the cases which are seen here generally occasion much surprise to those who have been accustumed to the practice else- where. It would hardly be correct to say that both flexion and extension are always complete, but unless these conditions are obtained, we cer- tainly do not regard the result as successful. The extent of bone removed determines the degree

It is when the fractured bone has been improperly set, and the limb is found to be shorter than its fellow, that the surgeon racks his patient by desperately tugging at the ban- dages, and all to no purpose, as the muscles are sure to conquer in this contest. Indeed, when it is recollected that the proper stimulus to muscu- lar contraction is tension, the result of such a conflict will not appear so surj)rising as that any one should so far forget his jjhysiological prin- ciples as to engage in it. Instead of exciting the muscles to contract by subjecting them to exten- sion, the great objects in treating a fracture should be to place them at rest, and by protecting them from all sources of irritation to oppose their contractile action. For this pm-pose the pre- venting of motion is of most consequence, since

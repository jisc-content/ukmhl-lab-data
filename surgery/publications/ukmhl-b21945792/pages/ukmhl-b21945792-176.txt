16*4 LIGATURE OF THE CAROTID ARTERY. at the margin of the orbitâ€”and the remedy by ligatm'e of the carotid. The symptoms are so similar to those of aneurism by anaternids, that it seems at first sight as if there could be no doubt in regard to the natm'e of the disease. But it must be admitted that the sud- denness of commencement, without any premoni- tory sign or congenital preparation, together with the efiectual relief afforded by tying the arterial trunk leading to the part concerned, are not con- sistent with the ordinary featm'es of an aneuris- mal erectile tumom*. The only opportunity of solving the difficulty by dissection occmTed in the practice of Mr. Nunnely, who tied the carotid for what seemed to be a tumom- of the kind in question; but, on examination of the patient, who died soon after the operation, did not find any distinct evidence of the disease. While the patho- logy of this peculiar derangement thus remains obscure, it is satisfactory to learn, that m such cases the carotid artery may be tied with almost the certainty of affording complete and permanent relief.

42 AMPUTATION A'J' THE ANKL?:. the saw. Tliu result will bu best explained hy the following statement, dated 9th June 1846 D]-. Wilson to Mr. Syme. Edinburgh, 9th June 1846. Deae Sirâ€”You will remember that I lost my foot in January 1843. The stump healed rapidly, and in six weeks had all closed, except one small aperture, from which a slight watery discharge continued to come till the month of June, when it suddenly ceased, and complete cicatrization occurred. Since that period, I have experienced no pain or uneasy sensation of any kind, in the stump, nor any tenderness, making standing or walking irksome or unpleasant. I have very rarely experienced the feeling of the lost foot being still part of the body and the seat of pain, which is so common a complaint among those who have been deprived of limbs. For the last two years, I am not aware that I have known this sensation at all; if I have, it has made no impression on my memory. 1 can lean the Aveight

FISTULA IN ANO. contributious to pathology and practice, M. Eibes conveyed two very serious errorsâ€”by maintain- ing that the internal opening was always present, and that it was formed, in. the first instance, by ulceration of the mucous membrane, so as to pro- duce an abscess, by allowing the escape of intes- tinal matters into the celluar textm'e. That both of these positions are untenable, may be proved beyond the possibility of question, by examining the cavity of an abscess which gives rise to fistula soon after it has opened externally spontaneously, or been evacuated by incision. It will then be found, by iaserting a finger into the rectum and a probe into the sinus, that the mucous membrane, though to more or less extent denuded and ex- tremely thin, is at that period always quite entire. Haviag had my attention directed to the ob- servations of M. Ribes soon after their publica- tion, and ascertained the accuracy of his statements in regard to the position of the internal orifice, and the efficacy of a limited incision, I was sur- prised to find his views so inconsistent in other rcsj)ectH witli iriattci's of fact admitting of such

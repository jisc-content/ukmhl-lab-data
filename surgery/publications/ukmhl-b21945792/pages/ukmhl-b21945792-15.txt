3 FRACTURE OF THE THIGH BONE. every displacement of the broken surfaces must tend to mitate their muscuLar coverings, and hence the great value of Mr. Pott's improvement in the construction of splints, by making them long enough to extend beyond the joints at both ends of the broken bone. It is upon the same principle that the splint of Desault proves so use- ful, since its influence extends over all the articula- tions of the limb, and by preventing any one of them from mo^dng, keeps the whole in a state of perfect quiet. In treating a fractm^e of the thigh-bone, the first step should be to draw out the limb to its proper length, direction, and shape; and if this cannot be done readily on account of the patient's involuntary resistance, it may be accomplished through the aid of chloroform. Two splints of wood, leather, or pasteboard, the full length of the thigh, from the trochanter major on one side, and the perineum on the other, to below the knee on both sides, are then to be applied and secured by four or five looped bandages, and lastly, the long splint wrapped in a sheet or table-cloth, of which

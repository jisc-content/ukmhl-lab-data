UNION BY THE FIRST INTENTION. 103 The truth is, that after the bleeding has ceased, a discharge of serum and lymph or organisable matter takes place from the cut surfaces, which are then glued together, if sufficiently approxi- mated, and retained in contact. This process, instead of requiring to be preceded by inflamma- tion, is certainly subverted by it, so that heat, redness, and pain, may be regarded as evidence that adhesion will not be the result. But the old system of dressing by complete closure of the wound immediately after its infliction, prevented the discharge of both blood and serum, and thus allowed these fluids to accumulate so as to distend the cavity, and separate its sui^faces beyond the limits of adhesion, whence inflammation was ne- cessarily excited as the precursor of suppm^ation and granulation. From what has been said, it must be obvious that the bleeding vessels of wounds which are de- sired to heal by the first intention, should be care- fully secured, not merely for the prevention of injurious licmorrhage, but also to oppose the accumulation of Ijlood in the cavity.

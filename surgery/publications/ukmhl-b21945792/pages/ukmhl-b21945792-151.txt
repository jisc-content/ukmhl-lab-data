139 POLYPUS OP THE NOSE. 111 tlie coiu'se of a few days, during whicli one of the profuse bleedings took place, the requi- site sanction having been obtained, I was re- quested to do whatever seemed proper; and therefore, with the assistance of Dr. Duncan, which I had asked in anticipation of hemorrhage, pro- ceeded without delay to the operation. I used the ordinary small polypus forceps, and by a single twist of them brought away the whole of the morbid growth through the nose without any bleeding worthy of mention. Thus a disease regarded as incurable was instantly removed; the respiration became free; there was no more hemorrhage; and the general health soon became restored; so that the patient was able before long to return to Canada, where he resumed his military duties. He afterwards went to India and commanded one of Her Majesty's regiments during the mutiny campaign, never having experienced the slightest tendency to relapse, or any inconvenience except the loss of his olfactoiy sense, which was not regained.

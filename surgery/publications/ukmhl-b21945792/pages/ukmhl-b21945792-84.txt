^2 FISTULA IN ANO. Pott, who cxphiiiied, that the clifticulty of licaliiig proceeded not from any peculiarity of vital action in the texture, but from the mechanical obstacle presented by the thin septum that lay between the fistula and bowel, of which the simple division was sufficient to insm'e recovery. The princij)le of treatment thus established, though greatly superior to the old practice, was far from being perfect, since it requii-ed that the septum should be divided throughout the whole of its extent, which could not be done without con- siderable pain and trouble, the risk of haemorrhage, and a tedious recovery,^â€”Avith careful cbessing of the wound to prevent its edges from adhering prematurely.

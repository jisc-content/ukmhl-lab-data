FORMATION OF NEW BONE. 26 a severe shock, as its surface became bare to the extent of several inches, and showed that there would be an extensive exfoliation. At the end of six weeks the discharge, which had all along been profuse, appeared so disproportioned to the strength of the patient, who was greatly emaciated, and apparently threatened with the initative fever which precedes sinking—that amputation seemed requisite as a prudential measure, while it was at the same time ascertained that the bone had died throughout its whole thickness, and thus rendered the operation indispensably necessary. For, although the patient might possibly escape the danger of longer delay, it was e^ddent that in the event of his doing so, the limb could not be of any use to him from the deficiency of bone. It was therefore removed. It was long ago ascertained by Sir A. Cooper that in a limb provided with two bones, a loss of substance in one of them—unless its extent be very limited—does not admit of osseous repara- tion ; all that can be done towards it being a sort of conical prolongation of the di^'idcd extremities.

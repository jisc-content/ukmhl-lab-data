In order to make the requisite dissection, I next attempted to close the orifice by means of forceps, but found that it had the form of a slit which could not be thus commanded. It was also so near the clavicle, that pressm^e could not he employed below it, and, to my still greater concern, lay on the inner, or tracheal side of the vessel, so that the compression required for its closure, instead of being backwards upon the ver- tebrae, was outwards upon the vein. In these circumstances it seemed proper, so far as possible, to lessen the opposing difficulties, and I therefore ran a bistoury through the skin and the sternal portion of the sterno-mastoid, so as to divide this part of the muscle together with the superjacent integument. I then seized the edge of the slit in the artery, as it lay under my finger, with catch forceps, and desired them to be held so as to draAv the vessel towards the trachea, while still sub- jected to compression; then carefully scratched with the point of a knife until the arterial coat

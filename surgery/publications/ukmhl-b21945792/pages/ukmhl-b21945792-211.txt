On the 22d the patient being rendered un- conscious by chloroform, I dilated the urethra by introducing a succession of bougies gradually Lucreased in size, until the point of my finger was admitted into the neck of the bladder, where, feeling the tense resisting fibres situated there, I made a very slight incision hardly more extensive than the blade of a narrow straight bistoury em- ployed for this pm'pose.

The poLQt of most interest in this case is the illustration it afibrds of the advantage which attends a combination of dilatation and cutting for obtaining access to the bladder. Both of these means, when employed separately, are apt

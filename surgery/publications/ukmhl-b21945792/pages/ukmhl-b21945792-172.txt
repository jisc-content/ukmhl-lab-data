1 CO ANEURISM OF THE CAROTID ATHKKY. was broiiglit into view at its external edge, a little above the aperture, where a ligature was passed by the needle and tied. I repeated the same procedure below the wound, and, when it was completed, had the satisfaction of finding that my finger could be withdrawn without the slightest appearance of bleeding, instead of the tremendous gush which had previously attended its slightest displacement. The ligatures sepa- rated on the tenth day, and the patient, who had suffered no inconvenience since the operation, was dismissed on the 17th of July. I have thus particularly related the steps of this operation, because it was by far the most arduous that has ever occurred in the course of my surgical experience. Indeed, even now I can- not, without a shudder, reflect on my position, when the slightest displacement of one hand must have instantaneously caused a fatal hemorrhage from the carotid artery, and a ^^^?ong direction of the needle by the other, to the smallest possible extent, would have given issue to an irrepressil)le stream from the jugular vein.

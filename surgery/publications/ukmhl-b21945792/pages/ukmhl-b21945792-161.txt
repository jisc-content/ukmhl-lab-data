AXILLARY ANEURISM. 14.9 maud of the vessel. I then laid the cavity freely open, and with both hands scooped out nearly seven pounds of coagulated Ijlood, as was ascer- tained by measiu^ement. The axillary artery ap- peared to have been torn across, and as the lower orifice still bled freely, I tied it in the fbst instance. I next cut through the lesser pectoral muscle, close up to the clavicle, and holding the upper end of the vessel between my finger and thumb, passed an aneurism needle, so as to apply a ligatm-e about half an inch above the orifice. The extreme eleva- tion of the clavicle, which rendered the artery so inaccessible from above, of com'se facilitated this procedm-e from below. Everything went on favourably afterwards. The edges of the wound, which had been brought together by stitches of the silver suture, united chiefly by the first inten tion. The ligature was found loose on the thir- teenth day, the pulse gradually decreased in fi-e- quency as the patient regained his strength, and the discharge, which was at first profuse and mixed with clots of blood, progressively diminished.

The operation thus became established in Edinburgh, whence it must have been carried across the Tweed by many of the Englishmen who pursued their studies here, but does not appear to have found much favour in London until, at a comparatively recent period, it all at once came into fashion as a remedy for deafness, of which it is occasionally, but very sel- dom, the cause. Since the operation thus became generally adopted, it appears that the simple and efficient means originally employed for its performance have been supplanted by others in every respect inferior, such as scissors and guillotines. Of these, the former are very objectionable on account of their inability to execute the section with cer- tainty at one stroke, while it is difficult, or almost impossible to obtain an opportunity for a second.

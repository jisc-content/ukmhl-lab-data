86 HEMOKllHAGE FROM THE RECTUM. making another examination, I found that the external part of the sphincter was tightly con- tracted, and knowing that this might be the cause of bleeding, made a division of the tight muscular fibres. No blood was subsequently discharged, and the patient soon regained his healthy aspect. There is still another source of hemorrhage from the rectum, of which I have met with only one example. The patient was a young lady whom I saw along with the late Dr. Graham, the professor of botany. She had lost so much blood as to excite attention by her altered appearance, and was brought from the country in quest of relief. I could not detect any hemorrhoidal disease, or any other recognised derangement ; but observed, that when expulsive efforts were made, the blood issued from a small round orifice, apparently seated in a varicose vein. To this point I npplied n ligature, with the effect of affording complete relief.

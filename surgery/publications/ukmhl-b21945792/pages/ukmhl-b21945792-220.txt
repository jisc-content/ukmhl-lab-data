REMEDY OF STRICTURES, 208 Stream, the fistulous opening closed, find the pa- tient was dismissed cured on the 2d of Febniary. CASE II. A gentleman nearly 60 years of age, recom- mended to my care by Dr. Madstonc Smith of Exmouth, came here last sj)ring suflFering from a stricture of the urethra, which had existed for more than twenty-five years, and although treated by surgeons of skill and experience, had been long regarded as truly impermeable. I found a fistula in perineo, with great induration extending to the verge of the anus; but on the second day after the patient's arrival succeeded in passing a metallic bougie fairly into the bladder without any pain or a drop of blood. The dilatation was then carried on by successive steps and with in- tervals of sufficient length for preventing any undue irritation ; but all to no purpose, since the water still dribbled from the orifice of the urethra, and escaped in nearly an equal quantity by the fistulous opening, while the patient was dis- tressed by frequent calls to empty the l)ladder.

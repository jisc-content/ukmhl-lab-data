65 SPASMODIC STRICTURE OF THE AOTS. tlie conditions to which tlie titles above mentioned have been applied, since the tightness is not variable or fitful, and yields to a mode of treat- ment that proves ineffectual when employed for the spasmodic affections of other parts, while under fissiu-e cannot well be included a form of the disease, by no means rare, in which the sore is seated entirely within the spliincter. M. Boyer, to whom we are indebted for the first systematic account of both the derangements in question, described them as almost always existing together, the contraction being seldom, and the ulceration never found alone. He therefore concluded that the former was probably the primary, and, at all events, the dominating disease, and felt confirmed in this opinion, by observing that whenever the con- traction was removed, the ulcer healed.

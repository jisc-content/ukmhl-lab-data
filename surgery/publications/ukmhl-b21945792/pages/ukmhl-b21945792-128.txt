116 HYDROCELE OF THE NECK. HYDROCELE AND HEMATOCELE OF THE NECK. Collections of serous and also of dark coffee- coloured fluid are not unfrequently met with in the neck and neighbouring parts of the chest, where they have received the same designations as those given to accumulations of a similar kind in the tunica vaginalis. Such tumom^s are some- times connected with the thyroid gland, but may exist quite independently of it, and require the same treatment as the morbid conditions fi-om which they have received their respective titles. The iodine injection may be regarded as certainly efiectual when the fluid is serous, and even when it has the bloody character this means should be tried before having recom'se to the more severe measure of incision. In this case it may be neces- sary, however, to repeat the injection, in order to complete obliteration of the cavity.

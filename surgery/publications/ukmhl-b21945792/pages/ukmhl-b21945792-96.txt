HEMORRHAGE FROM THE RECrrUM. 84 Dr. Paterson to Mr. Syme. My dear Mr. Syme—The Rev. Mr. laboured under large and exhausting discharges of blood from the rectum, which had been going on for years. As there were some external hemorrhoids, you considered that these were most likely the cause of the hemorrhage. They were accordingly removed, since when there has been no bleeding whatever ; and nearly six months have now elapsed since the operation.—Yours, etc. RoBT. Paterson. J^ith, 31s< May 1861. How the presence of external j^iles causes bleeding from the bowel, or how their removal prevents it, I am quite unable to explain; but do not, on this account, regard these facts as of less importance in practice. If their occurrence were extremely rare, they would be of less consequence, but happening so frequently, as I have had occa- sion to see, their recognition is obviously a matter of no small practical importance.

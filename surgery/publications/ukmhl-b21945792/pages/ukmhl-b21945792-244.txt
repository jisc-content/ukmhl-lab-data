His Lectures on the Covenanters were addressed to popular audiences, and they are calculated to be exceedingly popular. . . . They have merits of their own; they are in passages very eloquent; they are full of graphic touches; they appeal with no small success to our S)-mpathies; and, though we cannot endorse the leading idea of the book, we must do it all honour as an advance upon previous ideas on the same subject."—Times. " This is an excellent little book, written in a large-hearted, earnest, pious, and thoroughly manly spirit " The style is forcible graphic, and robust; now and then perhaps a little stiff, sometimes pseudo- rhetorical, but, in general well suited to the subject These men, whatever be the reader's prepossessions, are really worth reading about. There was manhood in them."—Spectator.

The only vessel requiring ligature, which was a small branch of the circumflexa ilii, having been tied, I pressed the peritoneum inwards, and without any delay or gToping, placed my finger on the bifurca, tions of the common iliac. Finding that any attempt to bring the vessel into view would be quite impracticable, I proceeded to pass the needle imder it with such guidance as was afibrded by the very distinct perception of its coats, which in this situation are so loosely connected with the neighbouring parts as to render this mode of pro- cedure less dangerous than it might appear at first sight. Feeling the point fairly past the artery, I slid down a pair of dressing forceps, seized the thread, disengaged it, and completed the liga- ture with all the tightness possible. The tumour immediately became greatly reduced in size, and entirely lost its pulsation, but at the end of two

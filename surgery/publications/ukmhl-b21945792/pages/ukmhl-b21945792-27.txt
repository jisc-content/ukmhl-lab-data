UNUNITED FRACTURE OF THE HUMERUS. 15 joined with their employment, which wouhl have been equally efficient, although not associ- ated with any other remedial means. By the careful application of proper splints the humerus may be kept sufficiently free from motion for the accomplishment of osseous union under ordinary cii'cmnstances ; but to obtain that absolute immobility which is requisite for effecting con- solidation when delayed beyond the proper period, is attended with no small difficulty. Indeed, the only mode jof attaining this object seems to be the same as that employed in regard to disease of the hip-joint, with a similar view, which produces its effect by completely suspending action in all the articulations of the limb. In this case, how- ever, such simple means as the long splint are not applicable, and the only way of keeping all the joints at rest is to envelop the whole limb, together with the scapular region, in a firm case of starched pastel^oard, extending from the finger points to the back of the shoulder. When the morbid condition is too firmly established for being remedied by the mere en-

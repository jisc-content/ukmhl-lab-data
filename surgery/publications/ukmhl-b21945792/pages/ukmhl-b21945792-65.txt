53 EXCISION OF THE ELBOW JOINT. of mobility, and also the power of controlling it. For if too little is taken away, there will be more or less complete anchylosis; and if too much, such a relaxation of the muscles as must prevent their efficient action. In order to eradicate all the diseased or carious portions of the bone, it would very seldom be necessary to remove more than the articulating sm-face. But if limited to this extent, the operation would prove a failure in respect to mobility ; while, on the other hand, if the humerus were shortened three or four inches, as in the solitary case of Sir P. Crampton, a very long time would be required for the muscles regaining their motive power. As a general rule, I should say that the section ought to be about the commencement of the condyloid projections of the humerus, and at the base of the coronoid process of the ulna. As to the uniting medium, it might be expected, from analogy with what happens in fractures when there is no osseous union, that the medium of connection between the bones would be of a ligamentous nature, not imitating a joint, l)ut

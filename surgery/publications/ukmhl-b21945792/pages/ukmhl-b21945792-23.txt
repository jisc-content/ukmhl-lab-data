11 DISEASE OF THE HIP-JOINT. CASE I, A. D., aged 6, from Kiiiross, was admitted on the 17th of February 1860. Since the beginning of the year he had been falling off in flesh and strength. He complained of pain in the left hip and knee.

On the 12th of April the splint was taken off, the Hmb being straight, and the pain gone. On the 16 th the patient was dismissed cured. CASE II. F.

On the 22d the long splint was applied as usual. On the 23d of March the pain was gone. On the 28th he was dismissed cured.

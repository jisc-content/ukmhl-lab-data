POLYPUS OF THE NOSE. 133 dies having been tried without any good effect, a polypus was at length detected, but not considered remediable. More lately, an attempt had been made to extract it without success, and the symp- toms becoming more aggravated, the patient was sent to me. On examination I found a fibrous growth completely blocking up the nostril, and projecting backwards into the pharynxâ€”the boy, from long continued hemorrhage, being extremely emaciated and quite anaemic. I therefore lost no time in performing the operation as it has been described, by making the fore and middle finger of the left hand, placed behind the soft palate, co-operate with the small forceps introduced through the nostril. In this way the tumour was easily removed, though not without considerable bleeding, which, however, was the last sustained by the patient, who left the hospital on the 15th, and is reported to have soon afterwards completely regained his health.

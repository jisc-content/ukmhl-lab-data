Both of these errors originated from the desire of lessening pain and protecting the patient from the effects of excessive irritation, but were in truth com23letely opposed to the objects in view. For the tumours allowed to remain were apt to inflame, while the portions of them that had been merely strangled necessarily did so, in conse- quence of the obstructed circulation. The appli- cation of a ligature, says Sir A. Cooper, "is exceedingly painful if it be drawn tightly and so said Sir Charles Bell, with other sm-geons of eminence. To the directly oj)posite conclusion I was led by observing the very different effects of partial and complete strangulation on the same patient, and therefore adopted the principle of so far as possible including every part of the hemorrhoidal enlargement in the ligatm-es, and drawing them with the utmost practicable degree of tightness. The process is thus rendered either entii-ely free from pain, or attended by such a slight degree of it as easily admits of being coun-

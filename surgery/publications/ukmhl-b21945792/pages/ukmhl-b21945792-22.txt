10 DISEASE OF THE HIP JOINT, placed ill a proj)er position, and does not shew any tendency to resume its abnormal position after consciousness is regained. The length of time dm'ing which the sj)lint is required varies with the circumstances of the case, but in general does not extend beyond from three to six weeks. The patient's friends are frequently apprehensive of the health suffering from confinement, but are soon satisfied on trial that the effect is quite con- trary. The only medical treatment required is regulation of the bowels and diet—which should be nourishing, but not stimulating—wine being forbidden, and animal food restricted within narrow limits. Cod liver oil, if it can be taken without repugnance, will be useful; but nothing can be more preposterous than the common prac- tice of administering iodine, and mercury in such cases, or on other occasions when a strumous con- stitution is suspected.

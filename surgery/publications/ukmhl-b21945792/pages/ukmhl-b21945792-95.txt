83 HEMORRHAGE FROM THE RECTUM. Ml'. Craig of Ratho to Mr. Syme. My Dear Sir—The operation performed on Mr. D. in July 1845 was most successful. He was then 47 years of age, and looked quite anae- mic, ha^dng for many weeks lost a large quantity of blood at stool; the amount had daily increased, but the most carefid examination of the anus and rectum revealed nothing more than a quantity of loose skin external to the orifice. When he sat upon the stool in our presence, pure blood to the amount of several ounces was speedily discharged, and formed a cake of coagulum in the utensil. You merely removed the whole of the loose skin by scissors, saying that you had reason to believe this would prove sufficient, and the result was a complete and permanent cure, as the patient never passed any more blood, and is still in good health.—Yours, &c. James Craig. Ratho, 1861.

5S9 ON CLIMATES. Scilly islands, or at Guernsey or Jersey, as a situation fully exposed to the influence of the sea air; for tliere can he little doubt, that for equability of temperature, a very small island must have great advantages above every other situation on shore. But in the present state of our knowledge on this sub- ject, although we are fully justified in recommending a resi- dence in Devonshire or Cornwall as advisable in a certain stage of consumption, it does not appear that any meteorolo- gical observations will authorise us to represent the advan- tages, to be gained by such a residence, as by any means equivalent to those, which maybe found in remoter situations ; nor that the empirical testimony, derived from accounts of the comparative prevalence of the disease, is at all so clear, or so firmly established, as to make up for the want of evi- dence of a great and decided superiority of the climate. In the South of Europe, the situations which have been most frequented are Lisbon, or some other part of the pen- insula, the neighbourhood of Montpelier, and different parts of Italy. In Spain, and probably in Portugal, consumption is said to be not common, but by no means wholly unknown; and whether from accident, or from causes which are likely to have a constant operation, the climate of Portugal has certainly failed, in a number of instances, of producing any material benefit, where there has been apparently a very fair chance for the patient’s recovery. With respect to the South of France, it is perhaps sufficient to remark, that the general proportion of deaths from consumption at Marseilles is fully as great, as the greatest which has been observed in London, where, according to Dr. Heberdeii’s remark, its prevalence has of late years been so much increased. In Italy the disease appears to be decidedly less frequent; and there is no reason to doubt but that, in the Southern parts of that country, there may be situations in which the climate approaches to that of the neighbouring islands. It is however highly probable that some of these islands possess very considerable advantages over almost every part

ON CLASSIFICATION, 29 239. Generic names, which have been already em|oloyed, are to be preferred, where it can be done without incon- venience. [Sometimes however it is better to employ a new terra than to alter materially the application of an old one.] 240. Such generic names, as express an essential character or habit are the best. 242. An ancient name should be employed for a genus long established. 243—245. A good name once established ought not to be changed, even for a better or more ancient one. 246. If a genus is to be divided, the old name must remain attached to the most common species. 247. Generic names are to be written in Latin letters, the Greek letters being expressed, according to the established custom.

Long and harsh names are to be avoided. Names should scarcely exceed 12 letters. 250. Terms of art ought not to be employed for generic names. 251. Names of classes and orders are to be governed by the same rules as those of genera. The name is to be single, not unmeaning, hybrid, bar- barous, equivocal, inapposite, personal, too long, nor harsh. 253. Names of classes and orders should include their characteristic marks. [Dr. Cullen professes to have followed the precepts of Linne respecting denominations, as far as he has found it practicable.]

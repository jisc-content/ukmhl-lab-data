LAWS OF COMBINATIONS. 559 animal chemistry rather as immediately connected with phy- siology, than as a department of general chemistry, I pre- sume that abler men than myself, who may hereafter employ themselves in similar researches, may extend the science to a degree of perfection, which, to judge from its present state, could scarcely be expected, or even hoped. B. REMARKS ON THE LAWS WHICH GOVERN THE COMBI- NATIONS OF INORGANIC NATURE. ^ Larbok. II. 561. [This extract is retained rather as a historical document, relating to an important era in the progress of chemical science, than for the superior clearness or accuracy of the statements contained in it. A simpler and more satisfactory view of the whole atomic theory is now to be found in the common elementary works of the later English chemists.] 1. When two simple bodies^ of opposite electrochemical properties^ are capable of being united in various propor- tions^ the quantities of the positive body^ supposing that of the negative body to remain constant^ are multiples of the least possible quantityby the numbers 1, 1^, 2, 4... For example, lead, in its different states of oxydation, is combined with 7.7, 11.55, and 15.4 parts of oxygen. The two latter numbers are multiples of 7.7 by 1| and 2. In the two sulfurets of iron, 100 parts of the metal are united with 58.75, and 58.75X2zzl 17.5 parts of sulfur. Rem. 1. If we supposed the quantity of the positive body to remain constant, the result would be nearly the same, but the expressions would be more complicated. Rem. 2. The multiplication by 1| seems to be only ap- parent, from our not being acquainted with the combination which ought to be the first member of the series. Thus,

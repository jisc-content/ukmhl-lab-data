606 ON THE FUNCTIONS of an alkaline or an acid caustic, and its texture is conse- quently destroyed by the chemical attraction of such an agent, when it comes into contact with it. As far, there- fore, as the functions of animal life depend on the loco- motions of the solids or fluids, those functions must be capable of being illustrated by the consideration of the me- chanical laws of moving bodies ; these laws being fully adequate to the explanation of the connexion between the motive powers, which are employed in the system, and the immediate effects, which they are capable of producing, in the solids or fluids of the body : and it is obvious, that the inquiry, in what manner, and in what degree, the circula- tion of the blood depends on the muscular and elastic powers of the heart and of the arteries, supposing the nature of those powers to be known, must become simply a question belonging to the more refined departments of the theory of hydraulics. In examining the functions of the heart and arteries, I shall inquire, in the first place, upon the grounds of the hydraulic investigations which I have already submitted to the Royal Society, what would be the nature of the circula- tion of the blood, if the whole of the veins and arteries were invariable in their dimensions, like tubes of glass or of bone; in the second place, in what manner the pulse would be transmitted from the heart through the arteries, if they were merely elastic tubes ; and in the third place, what actions we can with propriety attribute to the muscular coats of the arteries themselves. I shall lastly add some observations on the disturbances of these motions, which may be supposed to occur in different kinds of inflammations and of fevers. When we consider the blood vessels as tubes of invariable dimensions, we may suppose, in order to determine the velo- city of the blood in their different parts, and the resistances opposed to its motion, that this motion is nearly uniform ; since the alternations, arising from the pulsation of the heart, do not materially affect the calculation, especially as the^

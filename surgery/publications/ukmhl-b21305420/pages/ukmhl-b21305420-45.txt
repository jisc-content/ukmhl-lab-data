OF PHYSIC. 13 comprehending them. It is true that, on account of the ex- cellence of the clinical and practical lectures, it has been more usual to visit Edinburgh at a period later than even the second year; but to me the acknowledged superiority of these lectures did not appear a compensation for the loss of time in attending others, which could only be repetitions of what had before occurred in the two first years spent in London. The choice of lectures must naturally depend on the previous acquirements and abilities of the student: but there is no danger of his attending too many in the begin- ning : since he will at first have little occasion to read, or to employ any more of his time with reference to his pursuits; and he need not be afraid of filling up as many of his hours with lectures, as his powers of attention enable him to un- dertake. The practice of taking notes from lectures is of clear and decided utility : and every student ought to make it a point to keep correct and complete notes of one course of lectures, on each department of medical science. But it will seldom be advisable to take notes of a first course, where two of the same kind are to be attended; in order that the mind may, in the first instance, be wholly devoted to following and com- prehending the lecturer.

I have never yet heard a lecture, which I found it difficult to follow, as mi-

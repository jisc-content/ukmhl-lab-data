640 R EMARKS grains of the blue mercurial pill, for ten or twelve days. A similar plan was pursued throughout the summer, by ray colleague. Dr. Warren, who was so good as to take charge of my patients, during my absence from town : on the 9th of August, he ordered a blister to the region of the liver, the mercurial pill, and a diuretic mixture with pure potass, nitrous ether, and digitalis ; on the 16th, some tincture of squills, with half a grain of elaterium, twice a day ; after- wards once a day ; then every other day.

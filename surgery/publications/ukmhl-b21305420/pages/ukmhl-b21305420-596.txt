ON THE LAWS 564 others it is exprlled by heat, and some metallic hydrates lose it only by being boiled in water. D. Where two oxyds are simply combined, the portions of oxygen which they contain are probably always either equal, or one a multiple of the other ; the one assuming the charac- ter of a weak acid with respect to the other : and this sup- position is rendered still more probable by the direct ana- lysis of double salts. E. The same observation may be applied to the binary combinations of acids, discovered by Davy, Gay Lussac, and Thenard, where the weaker serves as a base, which is only separable from the stronger by means of some other base, or by water, which the acids divide between them- selves. In the case of the union of the muriatic and carbo- nic acids, the quantities of oxygen are equal. 4. When more than two oxygenized bodies are united^ the oxygen^ in that which contains the leasi^ is a submultiple of that which is contained in each of the others. Â« A. 1. In salts and supersalts, the oxygen of the water of crystallization is a multiple of the oxygen of the base, by 1, 2, 3, to 10, or sometimes more. In supertartrate of potass, nitrate, muriate, and oxalate of ammonia, 1. In sulfate of lime, and of ammonia, and in muriate of barita, 2. In nitrate of bismuth, 3. In sulfate of copper and zinc, 5. In acetate of soda and muriate of lime, 6. In green sulfate of iron, 7. In sulfate of soda, 10. 2. In the subsulfate of iron, the oxygen of the water is equal to that of the base, and double that of the acid. In the subsubnitrate of lead, the oxyen of the water is only one third of that of'the base or of the acid. B. 1. In double salts, or triple compounds, the quantities

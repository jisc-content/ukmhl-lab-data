OF COMBINATIONS. 569 C. MISCELLANEOUS REMARKS. Larb. II. P. 200. The purest iron, of which the specific gravity was 7.8439, became less dense when laminated, its specific gravity being only 7.6 ; if there was no error in the opera- tions, [which however were very carefully repeated.] P. 577. According to Wiinsch’s experiment, it seems probable that some transparent mediums intercept the in- visible heat of the sun’s rays. P. 578, Seebeck has found that blue light causes oxy- muriatic acid and hydrogen to unite rapidly without any ex- plosion : orange light much more slowly. D. ANALYSIS OF CINCHONA. Afh. III. 347. By various solutions, evaporations, and precipitations, good yellow” bark is found to contain, in 100 parts. Of insoluble fibre and salts 73.75 Resin .50 Two modifications of tannin 7.35 Bitter syrup and calcarious salts 6.87 Cinchonate of potass, and lime, with brown extract 2.50 Mucilage, soluble only in boiling water 2.70 Brown colouring extract 1.25 Loss, chiefly of tannin rendered insoluble by precipi- tation 5.08 1. Cinchona probably derives its medical properties chiefly from a variety of tannin, which has an astringent and bitter taste, is of difficult solution after evaporation, precipitates solution of gelatin, and gives a green colour with sulfate of iron. Some of it is probably in the state of difficult solu- bility in the-first intance, and is first precipitated from the solution : this is partly dissolved in carbonated alkalis, and affords a gelatinous lump in cooling : that which is after- wards deposited is more soluble in the alkali, but leaves a powdery substance undissolved. This tannin of bark pre- cipitates tartar emetic and gelatin, like that of galls, but not iron ; it reddens litmus paper, and it affords, w ith infusion of

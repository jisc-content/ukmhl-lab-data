616 ON THE I'U NCTIONS becomes more energetic, so that, from this consideration, a force somewhat smaller would be required in the heart; on the whole, however, it appears probable, that the former of t these corrections must be the more considerable, and that the force of the heart must be measured by the pressure of a column, rather more than less than one hundred and one inches high : nor would this force by any means require a strong exertion of muscular power; for it only implies a ten- sion of something less than three pounds for each inch of the circumference of the greatest section of the heart; and sup- posing the mean thickness half an inch, an equal number of the fibres of some other muscles of the body would be capable of exerting a force of more than two hundred pounds, in the state of the greatest possible action. The force, here assigned to each pulsation, agrees ex- tremely well with the inference that may be drawn from an experiment of Hales, on the ascent of the blood in a tube connected with an artery of a horse. The whole height of the column being nine feet, the blood rose about three inches higher during each pulsation, which was repeated fifty or sixty times in a minute : now we may suppose the accelera- tion to have extended a little beyond the first half of the space thus described, so that two inches were described in two fifths of a second ; and if there had been no friction, nor any other cause of retardation, there can be no doubt that at least four inches would have been described in the same time; but the same column of nine feet, if it had been ac- tuated by its own weight, would have described thirty one inches in the same time ; consequently the force with which the blood was forced through the artery was nearly one eighth of the whole force of tension, as it appears in the for- mer calculation. The magnitude of the pulse must diminish in the smaller arteries in the subduplicate proportion of the increase of the joint areas, in the same manner as the intensity of sound is shown to decrease in diverging from a centre, in the sub-

628 ON THE FUNCTIONS ally after venesection. But if a very small number only of capillary arteries be obstructed, other minute branches will still be capable of receiving the blood, which ought to pass through them, without any great distension or increase of pressure; and this exception is sufficient to explain another experiment of Dr. Wilson, in which a small obstruction, caused by puncturing a membrane with a hot needle, failed to excite an inflammation. This species of inflammation is probably attended by less heat than the former; and where the obstruction is very great, it may perhaps lead immedi- ately to a mortification, which is called by the Germans a cold burning.‚Äù The most usual causes of inflammation appear to be easily reconcileable with these conjectures. Suppose any consi- derable part of the body to be aflected by cold ; the capil- lary vessels will be contracted, and at the same time the temperature of some parts of their contents Avill be lowered, from both of which causes the resistance will be increased, and the arteries in general will be more or less overcharged ; if then any other part of the system be at the same time debilitated or over heated, its arteries will be liable to be mor- bidly distended, and an inflammation may thus arise, w hich may continue till the minute vessels are supported and strength- ened, by means of an effusion of coagulable lymph. The immediate effect, either of cold or of heat, may also some- times produce such a degree of debility in any part, as may lay the foundation of a subsequent inflammation : but the first effect of heat in the bloodvessels appears to be the more ready transmission of the blood into the veins, by means of which they become very observably prominent: and cold, which checks the circulation in the cutaneous vessels, probably occasions a livid hue, by retaining the blood stagnant longer than usual in the capillary vessels of all kinds. It may be objected, that an obstruction of the motion of the blood through a great artery ought, upon these principles, to produce an inflammation in some distant part: but in this case, the blood will still find its way very

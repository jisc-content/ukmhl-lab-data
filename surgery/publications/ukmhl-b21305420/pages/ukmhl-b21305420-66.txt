APHOniSMS 34 [The same disease, existing in a different part, may some- times constitute a different species; but when the part differs neither in its structure nor its functions, it can only afford the distinction of a variety. Cull. syn. proleg. p. xxvi. For example, inflammatory fevers, with different local affections, require to be considered as separate species; but simple in- flammations of different parts merely as varieties. Dr. Willan appears to have arranged a great number of mere varieties as distinct species. In Ploucquet’s Nosology, the species and subspecies, varieties and subvarieties, depending on places, causes, or combinations, are multiplied without mercy : even Cusson, so much praised by Sauvages and Cullen, seems not wholly to have avoided a similar error, which is very likely to happen to those who confine themselves to a small part only of the whole system.] CHAPTER X.

They may be arranged either in the direct or the inverse order of time. Linne generally adopts the inverse order. 321. Each synonym is to begin a new line. [The Linnean synonyms, including the specific characters, require a larger space than the usual citations of medical or other authors.] 322. Synonyms must be accompanied by the names of the authors, and the pages of the works in which they are to be found. The author’s own name may be omitted, in references to former works; those of other authors are to begin with ca- pitals, but the woiks quoted are to be indicated by single words, beginning with small letters, as Tournef. paris. 381. 323. The name of the first discoverer should be noted, in order to assist in the history of the science. [The references to ancient authors have generally been omitted by Cullen, on account of the inutility as well a

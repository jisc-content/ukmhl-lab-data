OF THE HEART AND ARTERIES. 607 are much less sensible in the smaller vessels than in the larger ones, and the principal part of the resistance arises from these small vessels. We are to consider the blood in the arteries as subjected to a certain pressure, by means of which it is forced into the veins, where the tension is much less considerable ; and this pressure, originating from the contractions of the heart, and continued by the tension of the arteries, is almost entirely employed in overcoming the friction of the vessels : for the force required to overcome the inertia of the blood is so inconsiderable, that it may, without impropriety, be wholly neglected. We must there- fore inquire, what the magnitude of this pressure is, and what degree of resistance we can suppose to arise from the friction of the internal surface of the blood vessels, or from any other causes of retardation. The magnitude of the pressure has been ascertained by Halesâ€™s most interesting experiments on a variety of animals, and may thence be esti- mated with sufficient accuracy for the human body ; and for determining the magnitude of the resistance, I shall employ the theorems which T have deduced from my own experi- ments on very minute tubes, compared with those which had been made by former observers under different circumstances; together with some comparative experiments on the motion of water and of other fluids in the same tubes. Dr. Hales infers, from his experiments on quadrupeds of different sizes, that the blood in the human arteries is sub- jected to a pressure, which is measured by a column of the height of seven feet and a half: in the veins, on the con- trary, the pressure appears to amount to about six inches only : so that the force which urges the blood from the greater arteries through the minuter vessels into the large veins, may be considered as equivalent to the pressure of a column of seven feet. In order to calculate the magnitude of the resistance, it is necessary to determine the dimensions of the arterial system, and the velocity of the blood which flows through it. Ac-

ON CLASSIFICATION. 53 ' 298. The specific character must be expressed in positive terms, not negative. Privatives are often unavoidable, although in some measure objectionable. Indivisum, inerme, enerve, avenium, acaulis are allowable; non papposum, non asperum, non bifidum, bad. [Cullen observes that distinctions deduced from the ab- sence of symptoms are not good, but sometimes unavoidable. Synops. proleg. p. xxxvi.] 299. Resemblances, if ever employed for specific charac- ters, must be striking and well known. As the ear, the finger, or the eye. 301. Adjectives must immediately follow their substantives. 303. Conjunctive particles are to be excluded from specific characters, except where they are necessary to the sense. 304. Successive adjectives are not to be separated by commas. We use a comma for separating the parts which are men- tioned, a colon for a subdivision of any part: thus, Bauhinia inermis, foliis cordatis semibifidis: laciniis acuminatoovatis erectodehiscentibus. 305. A specific character must never contain a parenthesis, whether distinguished or not by the appropriate mark. A parenthesis is bad, as implying a defect of oi’der. CHAPTER IX. Of varieties, §. 306. To the generic name and specific character the distinction of a variety may be added, where it exists. ' The knowledge of the varieties of plants is more import- ant for domestic and culinary purposes, than for the advance- ment of natural history. 307. The generic name, the specific character, and the marks of varieties, are to be printed in different types. As CoNVALLARiA scapo nudo : corolla plena. 310. Very slight variations are to be disregarded. 315. The specific character must agree with all the va- rieties, as far as is practicable. 317. It is often as difficult and as important to reduce va- rieties to their proper species, as species to their proper genus. D

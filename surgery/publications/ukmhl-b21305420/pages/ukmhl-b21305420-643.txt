OF THB HEART AND ARTERIES. 611 can be no doubt that the resistance of the internal surface of the arteries to the motion of the blood must be much greater than would be found in the case of water: and supposing it about four times as great, instead of twenty inches, we shall have eighty, for the measure of a column of which the pres- sure is capable of forcing the blood, in its natural course, through the smaller arteries and veins; which agrees very well with Hales’s estimate. This determination of the probable dimensions of the ar- terial system, and of the resistances occasioned by its dif- ferent parts, is in some few respects arbitrary, at the same time that it cannot be materially altered without altering either the whole quantity of blood contained in the body, the diameters of the smallest capillary vessels, the mean number of bifurcations, or the magnitude of the resistance, all of which are here assumed nearly as they have been laid down by former observers : the estimation of the length of the successive segments only is made in such a manner, as to reconcile these data with each other, by means of the ex- periments and calculations relating to the friction of fluids in pipes. The effect of curvature in increasing the resist- ance has been hitherto neglected ; it can be only sensible in the larger vessels; and supposing the flexures of these to be equivalent to the circumferences of two circles, each two inches in diameter, the radius q being 1, we have r— .0000045» v'^ qk — —.0000045 X720 X 64z=.207, or about one fifth of an inch, for the measure of the additional resistance arising from this cause in the case of water, or four fifths for blood, which is a very inconsiderable part of the whole. It might be questioned whether the experiments, which I have made, with tubes of an inch in diameter, are suffi- cient for determining, with accuracy, the degree in which the resistance would be increased in tubes, of which the diameter is only one sixth part as great; and it may be 2 R 2

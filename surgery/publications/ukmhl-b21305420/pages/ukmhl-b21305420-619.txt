VII. AN ESSAY ON THE MEDICAL EFFECTS OF CLIMATES. Treatise on Consumption^ p. 82. A COMPLETE system of meteorology, even so far as the properties of climates, with regard to temperature only,- are concerned, presents almost as great difficulties as a complete theory of the nature and cure of diseases. In this, as in many other departments of medical knowledge, we perpet- ually find a multiplicity of accounts, apparently well attested, but totally at variance with each other, which render it de- sirable to appeal to some more satisfactory testimonials, than the results of common and superficial observation ; while the evidence, which would be required for forming useful conclusions, upon safe and scientific grounds, although in this case completely within the scope of the human faculties, is still such as to require, for its production^ a combination of perseverance and accuracy, which has certainly never yet existed, and which probably can scarcely ever be expected to be found in a sufficient number of collateral observers. Any voluminous work on the subject, whether systematic or empirical, must unavoidably contain much useless, and some erroneous matter â€¢ and a short statement of a few facts, which appear to be tolerably well ascertained, first, respect- ing the physical characters, and secondly, respecting the medical effects of the principal climates which deserve our notice, is all that it will be possible to attempt in the pre- sent essay.

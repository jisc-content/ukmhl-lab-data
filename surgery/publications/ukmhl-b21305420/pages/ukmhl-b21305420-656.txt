ON THE FUNCTIONS G24 attend the increase or diminution of its muscular exertions: [sometimes also there may be a spasmodic contraction of an arterial trunk ; and sometimes perhaps a partial obstruction from a small coagulum within a paralytic and debilitated vessel.] There is also another way, in which the diminution of the strength of an artery may increase the apparent mag- nitude of the pulse, that is, by diminishing the velocity with which the pulsation is transmitted : for we have seen that the magnitude of the pulse is in the inverse ratio of the length of the artery distended at once; and this length is propor- tional to the velocity of the transmission : but it must be observed, that the force of the pulse striking the finger would not be affected by such a change, except that it might be rendered somewhat fuller and softer, although a considerable throbbing might be felt in the part, from the increased dis- tension of the temporary diameter of the artery. How little a muscular force is necessary for the simple transmission of a pulsation, may easily be shown by placing a finger on the vena saphena, and striking it with the other hand at a dis- tant part; a sensation will then be felt precisely like that of a weak arterial pulsation. The deviations from the natural state of the circulation, which are now to be cursorily investigated, may be either general or partial; and the general deviations may consist either in a change of the motion of the heart, or of the capa- city of the capillary arteries. When the motion of the heart is affected, the quantity of blood transmitted by it may either remain the same as in perfect health, or be diminished, or increased. Supposing it to remain the same, the pulse, if more frequent, must be weaker, and if slower, it must be stronger; but this latter combination is scarcely ever ob- servable; and in the former case, the heart must either never be filled, perhaps on account of too great irritability, or never be emptied, from the weakness of its muscular powers. But the immediate effect of such a change as this, in the functions depending on the circulation, cannot be very material, and it can only be considered as an indication of a derangement

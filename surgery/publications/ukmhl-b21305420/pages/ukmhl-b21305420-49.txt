OF PHYSIC. 17 If lectures were perfectly composed and delivered, and perfectly remembered, they would supersede the necessity of books of any kind : and on the other hand, a-well selected course of reading would be very little inferior to oral instruction, except with regard to the inspection of prepara- tions, and the practice of dissection and operations. But in a pursuit so extensive as that of medicine, it is necessary to employ each of these modes of study with almost as much diligence, as if we depended entirely on it for information ; and it becomes desirable, that a course of reading should be pointed out, which may either be adopted collaterally with the attendance of lectures, or subsequently to it, or in both ways. Thus it will be highly proper to read some elementary chemical work, before any chemical lectures are attended ; and during dissection, some of the best books of anatomy should be employed, for comparing the descriptions with the actual appearances: and a similar mode should be adopted with respect to other departments. The principal course of practical reading will however more properly follow the completion of the established plan of elementary study; beginning with any department which may be chosen for an academical discussion or dissertation : and after graduation, in the many years which must elapse without much active employment, continuing the pursuit, by comparing the notes of lectures with the best authors in each department, and reducing the memorandums which have been made in reading, into a uniform system with those notes. Nor will there, in all probability, be any want of time for so extensive an undertaking: a sensible writer on medical c

154 PARANEUllISMI. is not sufficient to characterize even a variety; Apoplexia mentalis, 7; distinguished only by the cause, which is Iierc extraneous to the disease. Apoplexia sanguinea, Sennert.

Apoplexia sanguinea, Sauvages, I. 845; Carus spontaneus? 838; Cataphora coma? 835. B. With a feeble pulse, and a pale countenance. Apoplexia serosa, Cull. syn. xlii. 2. A difference of treatment is frequently required according to the distinction of these varieties: but it can seldom be ascertained, during life, Avhether there is a rupture of a vessel, and a consequent effusion of blood, or an oozing of serum into the ventricles, with a general disease of the coats of the arteries, except that in the latter case the symptoms are commonly more simply paralytic.

Apoplexia venenata, Cull. syn. xlii. 6. Seems scarcely to differ from C. apoplexia b, unless w hen it comes under the denomination Venenatio, or Asthenia. The case most directly in point is the Carus ab insolatione, Sauvagesy I. 142. But on the whole there seems not to be any sufficient reason for making this a distinct species.

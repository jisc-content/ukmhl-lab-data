The use of the semicircular canals has never been satisfactorily explained: they seem, however, to he very capable of assisting in the estimation of the acuteness or pitch of a sound, by receiving its impression at their opposite ends, and occasioning a recurrence of similar effects at different points of their length, according to the different character of the sound; while the greater or less pressure of the stapes must serve to moderate the tension of the fluid within the vestibule, which serves to convey the impression. The cochlea seems to be pretty evidently a micrometer of sound. Y. Vision.) (Eye.) See Nat. Phil. I. 447. II. 310.

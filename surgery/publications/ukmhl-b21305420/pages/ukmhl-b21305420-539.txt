IV. CHEMICAL TABLES. A. TABLES OF SIMPLE AFFINITY, AND OP SOLUBILITY IN WATER AT 60Â» F. The substances inclosed in parentheses are inserted in their respective places in order to avoid inconsequences among the simple afl&nities. The numbers marked with asteriscs may be employed for the determination of double decompositions: those which are inclosed in parentheses are inconsistent with the corrected order of simple elective at- tractions. See Phil, trans. 1809. S. Soluble. L. Little soluble. I. Insoluble. H. Boiling hot. It must be remembered that a substance, less strongly at- tracted by another than a third, will sometimes precipitate this third from its combination with the second, where a supersalt or subsalt is readily formed : thus the oxyd of lead decomposes the muriate of soda, forming a submuriate of lead ; the tartaric acid decomposes all the salts of potass, forming supertartrate of potass ; and the carbonic the sub- acetate of lead, leaving the acetate. A saline draught also, consisting of the acetate of ammonia, is decomposed and made pungent by the addition of pure magnesia, which stands below ammonia in the order of elective attractions, the mag- nesia probably forming a triple acetate with one part of the ammonia, and setting the rest at liberty.

The muscles which move the eye are subjected to insuperable associations of sympathy, although their motions are in one sense strictly voluntary. For instance, when one eye is diseased, it is by no means sufficient to cover this eye only, ‘‘ in order to give rest to its muscles,” as has been advised by a modern author, (Phil, trans. 1797,) since these muscles unavoidably follow the motions of the sound eye, as we may easily feel through the eyelid. Nor can we disturb the parallelism of the vertical diameters of the irides by any effort that we can make. FA THEMATOLOG Y. Gesenius pathematologie. 8. Erf. 1786.

ANIMAL C’HEMISTIIY. 555 lin detected it in a calculus from the bladder of tortoise ; hence it follows that man is not the only animal in which this acid is formed. The bladder resembles the intestines in its chemical nature. Its mucus may be collected by a filter, in small masses, which when dried generally become red, and show traces of uric acid ; if again moistened, they do not recover their viscidity. Calculous concretions were totally misunderstood by phy- siologists from Galen down to Paracelsus. Van Helmont compared them to tartar; Hales, Boyle, Boerhaave, and Slare examined them with some attention. Scheele dis- covered in some the uric acid, which he always found pre^ sent in the fluid that forms them, and hence concluded, that this acid was always the principal component part of the calculi. The properties of the uric acid have been still further investigated by Henry ; and the examination of cal- culi was pursued by Austin, Walther, Brugnatelli, and Pear- son. At length Dr. Wollaston published, in the Philoso- phical transactions for 1797, his analyses of gouty concre- tions and of urinary calculi, which he proved to consist of four principal kinds, containing uric acid, phosphate of am- monia and magnesia, oxalate of lime, and phosphate of lime. Three years afterwards, Fourcroy and Vauquelin published a still more extensive investigation, in which Wollaston’s discoveries are confirmed; although his name is not mentioned, either in this essay, or in Fourcroy’s Systeme des connois- sances chimiques : but having examined nearly 600 different specimens, they were enabled to make many important remarks on the modifications of their composition; they also discovered the presence of two additional substances, the urate of ammonia, and silica. The latter existed only in two specimens, and the former Brande considers as merely a combination of the uric acid with urea, although his rea-r^ sons do not appear to be altogether conclusive,

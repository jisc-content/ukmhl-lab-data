OF THE HEAIIT AND ARTERIES. 613 whole, it is not improbable, that in some cases the resist- ance, opposed to the motion of the blood, may exceed that of water in a ratio somewhat greater than I have assigned ; but this must be in the minutest of the vessels, while in the larger arteries the disproportion must be less : so that, how- ever we may view the subject, it appears to be established, that the only considerable resistance which the blood ex- periences, occurs in the extreme capillary arteries, of which the diameter scarcely exceeds the hundredth part of an inch. We cannot suppose that the dimensions of the sanguiferous system agree uniformly, in all its parts, with the measures which I have laid down ; but the truth of the inference is not affected by these variations. For example, there may perhaps be some arteries commuicating with veins, of which the diameter exceeds the eleven hundredth of an inch; but there are certainly many others which are much more minute ; and the blood, or its more liquid parts, passing through these more slowly, it must move more rapidly in the former, so that the resistance may in all be equal to the pressure, and the mean velocity may still remain such as is determined by the quantity of blood passing through the aorta. There is indeed some uncertainty in the measure of the globules of the blood, which I have made the basis of the dimensions of the minute arteries ; and I have reason to think, that instead of inch, their greatest dia- meter does not exceed or even -3general re- sults of the investigation are not however affected by this difference : it will only require us to suppose the subdivi- sions somewhat more numerous, and the branches shorter, j^See the Essay on Blood and Pus. “ It is” also ‘‘ not im- probable that the viscidity of the blood may be a little greater than is here supposed, and the increase of resistance in the smallest vessels somewhat less considerable, so as to give a tension, in the arteries of a middle size, not quite so great as is calculated. Mr. Cooper has however never seen aneurysms of the radial and anterior tibial arteries con-

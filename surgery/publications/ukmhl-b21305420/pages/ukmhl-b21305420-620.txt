588 AN ESSAY The simple iudications of a thermometer, howerer ac- curately they may be observed, in the most unexceptionable exposure, by no means afford a correct test of the tempera- ture, as it affects the human system : nor is it possible to express the modifications produced by wind and moisture, even supposing them to be easily known, by any numerical measure which shall be applicable to every relative situation of the individual. I have known an atmosphere at 65°, with a thick fog, and a very little wind from the N. E., appear, to a person taking moderate exercise, most oppressively sultry ; although a person, sitting long still, might have felt the same air uncomfortably cold. Moisture must make both heat and cold more sensible ; the one, by diminishing per- spiration, the other, by increasing the conducting power of air. Wind is doubly concerned in affecting the properties of a climate ; first, as the great cause of preventing a general accumulation of heat over considerable tracts of country ; and secondly, as having a similar eflfect with respect to the immediate neighboui hood of the person; and its operation is as generally perceptible in the latter way, where we have no precise mode of estimating its magnitude, as in the for- mer, where it is correctly indicated by a thermometer suf- ficiently exposed : although, in fact, the most shaded fixed thermometer may often be observed to indicate a tempera- ture many degrees higher, than that of the breeze which is circulating in the neighbouring country. Still more com- monly by the sea side, the wind exhibits the temperature of the water over which it has blown: at Worthing it is seldom above 64° in the tiottest weather, although the sea, when the tide flows in at noon, over the heated expanse of sand, is sometimes raised to 78°, where it is several feet deep. To the inhabitants of these islands, the most important properties of the climates of other countries are those, which render them more or less fit for the residence of persons, liable to catarrhal or consumptive affections. Hence, warmth and equability of temperature, especially in the winter months, are the first objects of our inquiry in the

OF THE IIEAEtT AND ARTERIES. 621 resistances, immediately dissipate the blood with a con- siderable velocity, and completely prevent any local accu- mulation, unless the elastic powers of the vessel itself were diminished ; and this is, perhaps, the most important, as well as the best established inference from the doctrine that I have advanced. â–  It appears that a mola has sometimes been found in the uterus, totally destitute of a heart, in which the blood must have circulated in its usual course through the veins and arteries : in this case it cannot be ascertained whether there was any alternate pulsation, or whether the blood was carried on in a uniform current, in the same manner as the sap of a vegetable probably circulates. If there was a pulsation, it may have been maintained by a contraction of the artery, much more considerable, and slower in its progress than usual; and with the assistance of a spontaneous dilatation ; the resistance in the extreme vessels being also probably much smaller than usual : if the motion was continued, it would lead us to imagine that there may be some structure in the placenta capable of assisting in the propulsion of the blood, as there may possibly be some arrangement in the roots of plants by which they are calculated to promote the ascent of the sap. The circulation in the vessels of the more im- perfect animals, in which a great artery supplies the place of a heart, is of a very different nature from that of the more perfect animals : the great artery, which performs the office of the heart, is here possessed of a muscular power commen- surate to its functions, and seems to propel the blood, though much more slowly than in other cases, by means of a true peristaltic motion. It appears also from the observations of Spallanzani, that in many animals a portion of the aorta, next the heart, is capable of exhibiting a continued puls- ation, even when perfectly empty and separated from the heart; but this property is limited to a small part of the artery only, which is obviously capable of being essentially useful in propelling the blood when the valves of the aorta are closed. The muscular power of the termination of the

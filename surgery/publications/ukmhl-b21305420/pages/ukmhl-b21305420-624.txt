592 AN ESSAr remote we become from the mild gales of the Atlantic, while the prevalent South Westerly winds, in passing over a con- siderable part of the continent, must have lost much of their warmth. It is scarcely necessary to observe, that both Malta and Madeira present, numerically, a mean temperature for the winter months, as favourable for an invalid as can pos- sibly be desired. Equability of temperature is a second quality, of no small importance, as tending to diminish the chance of incurring, or aggravating, pulmonary diseases, by repeatedly taking cold. When, indeed, the temperature is much below 60Â°, the most material changes are those which occur upon going from the house into the open air; so that a cold climate be- comes, in some degree, of necessity a changeable one also. The regularity of this change, and the power of avoiding its effects by additional clothing, as well as of obviating them in some measure by exercise, contribute however to lessen its influence; and it does not therefore altogether supersede the effects of that changeableness, which consists in a great ex- tent of variation of the temperature of two successive days, or of different hours in the course of the same day. The simplest, and perhaps the best, mode of appreciating the effect of the extent of such a variation, in deteriorating a cli- mate, is to observe, for each month, the greatest variation, at the same hour, in any two successive days within its duration. The mean variation of successive days may also be computed, in order to assist in the comparison ; and the mean diurnal range, or the space through which the surface of the mercury moves, in ascending and descending, through- out the day and night, will give a collateral estimate of a similar nature. The best practical mode of deducing this range from the observation is, to find separately the mean of the heights for the morning and afternoon, and to double their difference. Where none of these particulars can be obtained, the extreme variation of each month will afford a character not altogether unimportant.

An intermitting or remitting fever, not contagious, with well marked exacerbations; usually periodical. The cause of such fevers appears to be exclusively the exhalation from half dry mud. 1. A. quotididna. The paroxysms recurring daily, and com- monly in the morning. 2. A. tertidna. The paroxysms recurring at the interval of about two days, commonly about noon. 3. A. quartdna. The paroxysms returning once in three days, commonly in the afternoon. 4. A. errat'ica. With paroxysms either irregular, or at longer periods than three days. These species are constituted in imitation of Dr. Cullenâ€™s genera; bnt, in fact, they often pass into each other, and are not more distinct than the intermittent and remittent type, or the simple and the bilious: and it will be most convenient to class most of our modern references under the heads Intermittents of temperate climates.

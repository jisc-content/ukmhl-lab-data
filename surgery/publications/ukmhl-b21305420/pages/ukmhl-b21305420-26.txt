ADVERTISEMENT. XX of the bloody which had formerly appeared in the Philosophical Transactions^ is now added to the detached essays here inserted; and it is followed by a paper on Palpitation^ from the Medical Transactions of the Royal College of Physicians, which has appeared to me to be of considerable importance in assisting the diagnosis of dropsy of the chest. For some explanation of the grounds of my decision in certain questionable cases^ I beg leave, in addition to what I have stated in my preface, to refer to a Letter, which is reprinted at the end of this volume, from the Medical and Physical Journal. 1 June^ 1823.

ON THE STUDY 12 age, whether at home, or at a private or public school, with the addition of arithmetical and mathematical learning, until the time of going to a university, which, if a boy has been diligent, need not be later than sixteen. At nineteen or twenty then, we may suppose the study of physic to com- mence, and that five or six years are to be allotted to its completion; the previous time having been spent in ac- quiring a sufficient proficiency in the Latin, Greek, French, Italian, and German languages, in mathematics and natural philosophy, and perhaps the elements of botany and che- mistry, besides drawing and some other similar accomplish- ments. There will be time enough after this for physic; and if the student has been placed at a university where no physic at all is to be learned, he will have no occasion to complain that his time has been mispent. Indeed a metro- polis must possess advantages for the study of physic, and disadvantages for many other studies: hence it seems a natural consequence that a university ought not to be the principal school of physic in any country. The example of Edinburgh must be allowed to prove that such a combina-? tion is not altogether impracticable; but it will not readily be granted by the inhabitants of South Britain, that we do not possess in our universities a greater fund of abstract science, and in our metropolis more favourable opportunities for the acquisition of medical knowledge, than are any where to be found in Scotland, or perhaps in the rest of Europe. Probably however the first year of medical study cannot be better spent than in an attendance of the lectures which are delivered in Edinburgh: they are in general more ele- mentary there than elsewhere; and a person, wholly unac- quainted with the subject, will find no difficulty in readily

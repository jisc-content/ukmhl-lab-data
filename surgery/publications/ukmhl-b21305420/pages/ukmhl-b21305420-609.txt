577 BLOOD AND PUS. M hich constitute a fleece, that preserves a uniform diameter throughout its length ; and the difference is still greater be- tween the fibres which grow on different parts of the animal; so that to take a single measurement, or even any practicable number of measurements, by the most accurate micrometer, in the usual acceptation of the term, for a criterion of the quality of a fleece, can tend only to the propagation of error or conjecture in the semblance of the minutest accuracy. Kven with the Eriometer, the difficulty of obtaining a fair average of the quality of a sample of wool is extremely great; it is absolutely necessary to preserve the fibres as much as possible in their natural relative situation, and to examine “them near the middle of their length; the ends next the skin are almost always considerably finer, and the outer ends generally coarser, than the rest; but this difference is' greater in souie kinds of sheep than in others, and as far as I have observed, it is less in the Merinos and their crosses than in other sheep: there is also far less difference in the different parts of the same fleece* in these breeds than in others ; still however this difference is very observable, although it is pro- bable that’some part of the sheep might be found, which in all cases might fairly be considered as affording nearly the average of whole fleece; and I‘imagine that the part of the back about the loins is the most likely to be possessed of this property ; so that the middle of the fibres of this part of the fleece might be assumed, in the finer kinds of wool, as afford- ing a fair measure for the whole. 3. Scale of the Eriometer. The theory, which suggested to me the construction of the eriometer, requires some corrections in its immediate applica- tion, which depend on circumstances not completely under- stood : at present therefore I shall only employ, for the de- termination of the true value of the numbers of its scale, an experimental comparison of its indications with some micro- scopical measurements, w hich Dr. Wollaston has been so good as to perform for me, with an admirably accurate micrometer of his own invention. 2 p

REMARKS ON 576 number representing the magnitude of the substance ex- amined. The instrument may be rendered more portable, though somewhat less accurate, by merely making the per- forations in a blackened card, furnished with a graduated piece of tape. An eye not shortsighted will generally require the assistance of a lens, when the instrument is made of the most convenient dimensions, which I have found to be such as to have two circles of points, one at ^ and the other i- of an uich in semidiameter, with their corresponding scales. The central perforations are about and of an inch in diameter .; the points 8 or 10 only in each circle, and as minute as possible. The light of the sun might also be em- ployed, by fixing the circle of points at the end of the tube of a telescope : but it rather adds glare than distinctness to fhe colours: nor have I been able to gain any thing by look- ing through coloured glasses, or by using lights of different qualities. Where the object consists of fibres which can be arranged in parallel directions, a fine slit in the plate or card affords brighter colours than a simple perforation (W.) and the points must in this case be arranged in lines parallel to the slit; but if care is not taken to stretch the fibres suffi- ciently, the employment of the slit in this manner will make them appear coarser than they really are. The colours will still appear, even if there be a considerable difference in the dimensions of the fibres or particles, but they will be so much the less distinct as the difference is greater. In this case the measure indicated will be intermediate between the extreme dimensions ; although most commonly it will be somewhat below the true mean, the colours exhibited by the finer fibres prevailing in some degree over the rest. The latitude, how- ever, which the Eriometer affords in the regularity of the substances measured by it, and its collecting into one result the effect of many thousands of particles, or of an endlefs variety of small differences in the diameters of fibres, give it an unquestionable preference over every kind of micrometer which measures a single interval only at once, with respect to all applications to agriculture or manufactures; for in reality there is not a single fibre of wool among the millions

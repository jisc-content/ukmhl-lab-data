550 A SKETCH OF is, that the process should be conducted slowly and in weak infusions; when it is too much hastened, the external parts of the leather are overloaded with tannin, impede its ad- mission into the internal parts, and afford a hard, brittle, and thin leather. The rete mucosum of Malpighi has not been examined; it has only been observed that its dark colour in Negroes is bleached for some days by the oxymuriatic acid. The epi- dermis is not soluble by long boiling in water, but is dis- solved by caustic alkalis and by acids, and in most of its chemical relations resembles the hair and the nails. The sebaceous matter of the skin has not been immediately ana- lysed ; but Vauquelin has examined that which accompanies sheepâ€™s wool, and found, that it contains, together with car- bonated alkali, albumen, with the acetates of lime and potass, and a peculiar saponaceous compound of potass, lime, and a resinous fatty substance. He derives its greasi- ness from a part of the oil, which is separated as the alkali becomes carbonated in the air: but it seems difficult to con- ceive how carbonated alkali can exist together with pure lime. Vauquelin and Buniva found a curdy kind of fat on the skin of the foetus, which defends the cuticle from the effect of the liquor aranii. The secretion of the skin is distinguished by the evapora- tion to which the extent of the surface renders it liable ; its quantity has been very carefully examined by Sanctorius, Dodart, Keil, Robertson, Rye and Lining; and lately by Lavoisier and Seguin in France, and by Cruikshank in Eng- land: on an average it is found to amount to 4^ pounds in a day, being most abundant during digestion, and least so immediately after eating. Cruikshank collected in a glass, in which he kept his hand, the fluid that exhaled, and he found it pure water. There was a portion of carbonic acid in the air, which was probably derived from the effect of the air on the matter that evaporated, since its volume was not increased. He found that more water was collected

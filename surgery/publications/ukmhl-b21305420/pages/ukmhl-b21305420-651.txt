OF THE HEART AND ARTERIES. 619 in the case of an elastic tube, the velocity of the transmission of an impulse being rather diminished than increased by an increase of tension, the reasoning is still stronger and simpler; for it may here be safely asserted, that the anterior parts of the dilatation, which must be forced along by any progressive contraction of the tube, can only advance with the velocity appropriate to the tube, and that its capacity must be pro- portionate to its length and to the area of its section : now the magnitude of its section must be limited by that degree of tension which is sufficient to force back through the con- traction what remains of the displaced fluid, and the length by the dilfference of the velocity appropriate to the tube, and that with which the contraction advances ; consequently if the contraction advance with the velocity of a pulsation, as any contractile action of the arteries must be supposed to do, this length necessarily vanishes, and with it the quantity of the fluid protruded; the whole being forced backwards, by the distending force which is exerted by a very small dilated portion, immediately preceding the contraction. It might indeed be imagined, that the contraction follows the pulsation with a velocity somewhat smaller than its own; but this opinion would stand on no other foundation than mere conjecture, and it would follow, that the pulse would always become more and more full, as it became more dis- tant from the heart; of which we have nothing like evi- dence ; nor would a moderate contraction, even if this sup- position were granted, produce any material eflTect. For example, if the velocity of the contraction were only half as great as that of the pulsation, which is the most favourable proportion, it would be necessary, taking sixteen feet in a second for the velocity of the pulsation, that the section of the arteries should be contracted to about one half, in order to produce, by their progressive contraction only, the actual velocity of the blood in the aorta; one sixteenth of the blood being carried, in this case, before the contraction : but if the contraction were only such, as to reduce the section of the artery to which is probably more than ever actually

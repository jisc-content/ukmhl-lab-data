610 ON THE FUNCTIONS the distance of an inch and a quarter only from the extreme capillary arteries, the pressure of a column of one twentieth of an inch only is required for overcoming the whole fric- tion, and at the twenty fifth division, where the artery does not much exceed the diameter of a human hair, the height to which the water could rise, in a tube fixed laterally into the artery, is only two inches less than in the immediate neighbourhood of the heart. In order to judge of the comparative resistance produced by fluids of different degrees of viscidity, I employed the same tubes, by means of which I had determined the friction of water, in extreme cases, for ascertaining the eflTect of dif- ferent substances held in solution in the water: since it is impossible to make direct experiments on the blood in its natural state, on account of its tendency to coagulate: and those substances, which have the power of preventing its co- agulation, may naturally be supposed to produce a material change in its viscidity. The diameter of one of the tubes, which was cylindrical, was the fortieth part of an inch: the bore of the other was oval, as is usual in the finest tubes made for thermometers : the section, divided by one fourth of the circumference, gave a one hundred and seventy second for the mean diameter. 1 caused some milk, and solutions of sugar of different strength, to pass through these tubes : they were all transmitted much more sparingly than water, with an equal pressure, and the difference was more considerable in the smaller than in the larger tube, as might naturally be expected both from the nature of the resistance, and from the result of Gerstnerâ€™s experiments on water at different temperatures. In the first tube the resistance to the motion of milk was three times as great as to that of water; a solu- tion of sugar in five times its weight of water produced twice as much resistance as water; in twice its weight, nearly four times as much as water: but in the narrower tube, the weaker solution of sugar exhibited a resistance five times as great as that of water, which is more than twice as much as appeared in the larger tube. Hence there

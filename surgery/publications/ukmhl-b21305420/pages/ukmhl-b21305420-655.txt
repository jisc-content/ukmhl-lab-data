623 OF THE HEART AND ARTERIES. According to this statement of the powers which are con- cerned in the circulation, it must he obvious that the nature of the pulse, as perceptible to the touch, must depend almost entirely on the action of the heart, since the state of the arteries can produce very little alteration in its qualities. The greater or less tension of the arterial system may indeed render the artery itself, when at rest, somewhat harder or softer; and, if the longitudinal fibres give way to the tend- ing force, it may become also tortuous : possibly too a very delicate touch may in some cases perceive a difference in the degree of dilatation, although it is seldom practicable to dis- tinguish the artery, in its quiescent state, from the surround- ing parts. But the sensation, which is perceived when the artery is compressed, as usual, by the finger, is by no means to be confounded with the dilatation of the artery; for in this case an obstacle is opposed to the motion of the blood, against which it strikes, with the momentum of a consider- able column, almost in the same manner as a stream of water strikes on the valve of the hydraulic ram; and in this man- ner, neglecting the difference of force arising from the dif- ferent magnitudes of the sections, the pressure felt by the finger becomes nearly equal and similar to that which is originally exerted by the heart: each pulsation passing under the finger, in the same time, as is required for the contrac- tion of the heart, although a very little later; and more or less so, in proportion as the artery is more or less distant; the artery remaining then at rest for a time equal to that in which the heart is at rest. When therefore an artery appears to throb, or to beat more strongly than usual, the circum- stance is only to be explained from its greater dilatation, which allows it to receive a greater portion of the action of â€¢ the heart, in the same manner as an aneurysm exhibits a very strong pulsation, without any increase of energy, either in itself, or in the neighbouring vessels; and on the other hand, when the pulsations of the artery of a paralytic arm become feeble, we cannot hesitate to attribute the change to its permanent contraction, since the enlargement and con- traction of the blood vessels of a limb are well known to

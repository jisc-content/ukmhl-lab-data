FACULTIES OF THE MIND. 98 theory, it brings us very little nearer to a clear idea of the nature of sensations, as affecting the mind; for there seems, both in the eye and in the ear, to be an arrangement to supersede the necessity of the performance of the numerical operation of counting vibrations within the brain; each sentient point of the retina appearing to be capable of receiving only three distinct and primitive impressions of colour, variously combined; and the semicircular canals, with the cochlea, probably serving to substitute the impression of certain parts of the nerve being peculiarly affected, for that of the frequency of the recurrence of the pulsation. The other organs of sense, which are destitute of this intermediate arrangement, seem to be capable of much less precision in appreciating the relations of the subjects of their respective functions.

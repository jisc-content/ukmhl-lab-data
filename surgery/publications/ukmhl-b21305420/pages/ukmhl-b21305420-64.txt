APHORISMS 32 [Thus Podagra atonica, cum ventnculi vel alius partis internae atonia, et vel sine expectata aut solita artuum inflam- matione, vel cum doloribus artuum lenibus tantum et fagaci- bus, et cum dyspepsia vel aliis atoniae syraptomatis, subito saepe alternantibus.” Dr. Cullen professes to have less ap- prehension of too many words than of too few: a principle which is highly proper as applied to a detailed description, but not to a specific character. If 12 words were thought too few for the specific characters of diseases, we might allow of 15 or even 20; but for 30 there can be no possible occasion. Dr. Willan’s valuable work on cutaneous diseases loses much of its utility from the total omission of regular specific characters.] 292. Specific characters must contain only such words as are necessary for distinguishing the species from others of the same genus. . 293. When a genus contains only one species, a specific character is superfluous. [There may however be cases in which a character, pointed out as likely to be essential, by a person well acquainted with the species, may be useful in distinguishing it from others subsequently discovered.] 294. When a new species of a genus is discovered, the characters of all the other species must be accommodated to it, if they become inadequate. 295. The words forming a specific character are not to be compounds resembling generic names, nor purely Greek, but Latin; and the more simple they are, the better. Belleval gives, as specific characters, Chondrilla vo'nohv'n.av'Kosj Glycyrrhiza Hieracium [The trivial names of Ploucquet’s Nosology are some- what similar, hydrocatarrhophicus,” meranaestheticus,” spondylexarthreticus;” such words as these are inconve- nient from their mere length.] 296. The specific character ought not to be embellished by the flowers of rhetoric, but natural and faithful. 297. The specific character admits neither comparatives nor superlatives.

OF THE IIEAIIT AND AllTERIES, 617 duplicate ratio of the quantity of matter affected by its mo- tion at the same time. For example, in the arteries of the tenth order, of which the diameter is one thirteenth of an inch, its magnitude must be only one third as great as in the aorta, that is, the greatest progressive velocity of the blood must be eight inches and a half in a second only, and the dilatation one fiftieth part only of the diameter. In the vessels of the twentieth order, the dilatation does not exceed of the diameter, w hich is itself the 140th part only of an inch : so that it is not surprising, that Haller should have been unable to discover any dilatation in vessels of these . dimensions, even with the assistance of a powerful micro- scope. If we estimated the magnitude of the pulse in the aorta, frem the excess of the temporary above the mean ve- locity, which w^ould perhaps be justifiable, that magnitude would become still less considerable. These calculations agree extremely well with each other, and with experiment, as far as they relate to the power of the heart, and the affections of the smaller arteries. But there is reason to think that the velocity of the pulse in the larger vessels is much more considerable than has been here stated ; and their dilatation is also less conspicuous, when they are exposed to view, than it would probably be, if it were as great as is inferred from the velocity here assigned. I have demonstrated, in the hydraulic investigations which I lately laid before the Royal Society, that the velocity of an impulse passing through a tube, consisting of perfectly elastic ma- terials, is half as great as that of a body supposed to have fallen from the given point to the base of the modular column of the tube : and that the height of this column is such that the tube would be extended without limit by its pressure; consequently it must be greater than the height of a column equivalent to the pressure by which the tube is burst. Now it has been ascertained by Dr. Hales, that the pressure, re- quired for bursting one of the carotids of a dogj is equal to that of a column of water one hundred and ninety feet high ; nor does he remark that the artery was very materially

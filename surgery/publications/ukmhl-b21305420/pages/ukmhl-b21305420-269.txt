XV. CAUMA. 237 Borsieri, Bianchl, Pringle, Lieutaud, Saunders, BalHie und Sdmmering.) Case examined 24 March, 1812. John James, about 20, has for some months expectorated bile, and passed faeces without any; he was some time in Portugal, and was there supposed to have had a hepatitis. He*was slightly salivated, and latterly took powerful cathartics, but without effect: his strength gradually declined, his cough increased, and his appetite failed. The common biliary duct, at its entrance into the duodenum, was completely blocked up by the coats of a hydatid: a considerable cavity in the right lobe of the liver communicated freely, through the diaphragm, with the lungs, in which was a still larger cavity: the whole was filled with bile, and with hydatids of various dimensions, all empty and flaccid except a very few. The lungs on the left side were tolerably sound. Bilious expectorations have very frequently been relieved by purgatives; and it has sometimes been found of advantage to order the bile to be swallowed (C.) ; but in this case the stomach rejected almost all liquids that were offered to it: sometimes opiates were given in pretty large doses, which might have been expected to release the obstructing substance, if it had been confined by. any spasmodic stricture; and it is difficult to say what further mode of relief could have been employed, if the precise nature of the disease had been ascertained.

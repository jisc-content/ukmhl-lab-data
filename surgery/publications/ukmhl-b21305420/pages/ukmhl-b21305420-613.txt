BLOOD AND PUS. 581 the candle, and their dimensions will be no longer variable, whatever may be the state of the pupil. But the candle must in this case either be placed at a distance, or be partly concealed from the eye, unless one edge of the aperture pro- ject so far beyond the other, as to limit its visible extent. Now the substance, in which the lens of a microscope is con- tained, presents a small aperture capable of exhibiting elfects of this kind, which however can only be expected to appear when the light is peculiarly circumstanced. The aperture of the highest magnifier that I have employed is of an inch, which answers to about n.330 of the scale of the Eriometer, and would consequently exhibit a bright ring at of the distance of a minute object viewed through it, while the darkest part within this ring would be at about of that dis- tance : and the focal distance of the lens being about of an inch, the diameter of the apparent dark circle would be TTTTo inch, and that of the bright one ; and the dimensions would be nearly the same if any other small lens were employed, with an aperture half as great as its focal distance ; so that the constancy of such an appearance, not- withstanding a change of magnifiers, might increase the pro- bability of error. It is obvious that a shade of this kind, sur- rounding the central parts of a globule, if they happened to be much brighter than the rest, might give rise to a mistaken idea of inequalities in its form or structure; and it is possible that when a particle is darker than the surrounding medium, some parts of its surface may have lines of a similar nature projected on them in an inverse order. The particles of the blood are about of an inch in diameter, varying fiom T0W5 extremely possible that an object of these dimensions may exhibit a light point near its centre, which may be surrounded by a dark and then by a light annular shade within the limits of its disc. There are also several other sources of error in different lights, and in a focus more or less imperfectly adjusted; it is however sufficiently evident that no fallacy of this kind can have given rise to all the appearances, which have been already described, as ob- servable in the particles of the human blood, and still less to those which are observable in the blood of some other animals.

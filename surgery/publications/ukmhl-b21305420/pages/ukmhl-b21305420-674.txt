642 REMARKS ON PALPITATION. the infusions of gentian and senna, with the tinctures of jalap and squills. When the dropsical symptoms subsided, the beating and palpitations ceased also: so that we have, in this case, no positive proof that the pulsation did not arise from the simple reflux of the blood in the internal and exÂ« ternal jagular veins; since it is well known, that such a reflux does often actually take place, and exhibit a vibratory motion, of a nature nearly similar, in cases of palpitation, without any water in the chest.* * After several vicissitudes of abatement, and return of the symp- toms, this patient sunk under the disease in March, 1815. The last attack was too sudden to allow her being conveniently removed back to the hospital; but it was her own wish that an examination should be made after her death, and Mr. Hewett, a pupil of the hospital, had the goodness to perform the dissection. There was no material collection of water on either side of the thorax, but there were about 12 ounces in the pericardium, and the heart was considerably enlarged, especially the right auricle, Mr. Hewett had also lately seen another case, in which a collection of water in the pericardium had caused a singular pulsation on the right side of the chest. These dissections, though they do not immediately illustrate the appearance of pulsation in the neck, which is sometimes so remarkable, assist in confirming the truth of the observation, that water effused in the chest may not only be a cause of palpitation, by disturbing the regularity of the motions of the heart, but also by rendering the effect of those motions sensible in parts more or less remote from their origin.

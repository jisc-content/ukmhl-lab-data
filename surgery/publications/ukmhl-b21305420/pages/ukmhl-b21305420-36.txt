4 ON THE STUDY hensive grasp of a powerful mirrd, which can embrace the relations of all the various parts of the whole subject, and can illustrate and improve the science, by a comparison of its different departments, and by the new lights which they throw on each other : and the question extends to all other professions, and to the general education which is necessary to those who engage in them. Its solution must however depend, in great measure, on the nature of the acquirement which is proposed to be obtained. A mathematician may arrive at the highest possible degree of eminence in the dif- ferent modes of calculation, without requiring any assistance from an accurate knowledge of different languages; a lin- guist may be completely master of all subjects of grammar and criticism, without the slightest acquaintance with geo- metry : and there are other branches of study, so confined within themselves, and so capable of accurate deduction and precise definition, as to be completely independent of all others, and to require the exercise of clear apprehension and correct memory only for their pursuit. Other departments however defy all attempts to subject them to any didactic method, and require the exercise of a peculiar address, a judgment, or a taste, which can only be formed by indirect means : a composer of music, for example, would make him- self ridiculous, if he attempted to put in practice the vision- ary proposition of Kircher, who states it as a problem, to be solved like those of the elements of Euclid, the nature of an affection or passion of the mind being given, it is required to delineate it correctly in a musical composition.‚Äù And it appears that physic is one of those departments, in which there is frequent necessity for the exercise of an incommunicable faculty of judgment, and a sagacity, which may be called transcendental, as extending beyond the

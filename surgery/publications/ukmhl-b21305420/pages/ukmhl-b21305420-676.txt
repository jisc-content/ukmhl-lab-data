G44 A LETTER TO THE EDITORS OF A us: and how you will be able to exculpate yourselves be- fore them for so unaccountable a misrepresentation, which you have expanded into a whole page of argument, I am utterly at a loss to foresee. You have either censured M'hat you have not read, or what you have read and forgotten ; for I cannot believe you both mischievous and foolish enough to advance such an accusation, at the moment that you were fully aware of its falsehood. Whether or no you were in the same happy predicament of inattention or oblivion when you asserted that I spoke lightly of the clinical lectures of Edinburgh,” I will not pretend to determine ; perhaps you will solemnly maintain that to mention in express terms their excellence^'* and acknowledged superiority^*'* 15) is to speak lightly of them; but this is more a matter of opinion than the for- mer, and therefore I shall not expect you to retract it. It is, however, an absolute misstatement to say that I have considered the affections comprehended under the term PNEusis as one disease; for I have most carefully remarked (p. 28) that I have intentionally united different diseases, as species constituting the same genus^ according to their natural analogies, and to the most convenient mode of treating of them : uor have you been more correct in insinu- ating that the gout is to be found in two places, without any reference from one to the other ; for in fact there are re- ferences in both the passages, in which I have thought it necessary to mention respectively the different forms of this very anomalous disease. The charges, which you have grounded on these supposed offenses, do not very materially affect the general merits of the work ; nor should I think i(s credit much diminished by admitting the truth of all else that you have advanced against it, especially if you succeeded in convincing your readers that it ought to be in the library of every medical scholar to whom tlie work of Ploucquet is inaccessible,” and

629 OF THE HEAllT AND ARTERIES. copiously into the parts supplied by the artery, by means of some collateral branches, which will always admit a much larger quantity of blood than usually passes through them, whenever a very slight excess of force can be found to carry it on, or when the blood which they contain finds a readier passage than usual, by means of their commuttication with such parts as are now deprived of their natural supply. It is difficult to determine, w hether blushing is more pro- bably effected by a constriction or by a relaxation of the vessels concerned ; it must, however, be chiefly an affection of the smaller vessels, since the larger ones do not contain a sufficient quantity of blood to produce so sudden an effect. Perhaps the capillary vessels are dilated, while the arteries, which are a little larger only, are contracted ; possiby too an obstruction may exist at the point of junction of the arteries with the veins; and where the blush is preceded by paleness, such an obstruction is probably the principal cause of the whole affection. â€¢ With respect to the tendency of inflammation in general to extend itself to the neighbouring parts, it is scarcely pos- sible to form any reasonable conjecture that can lead to its explanation : this circumstance appears to be placed beyond the reach of any mechanical theory, and to belong rather to some mutual communication of the functions of the nervous system, since it is not inflammation only, that is thus pro- pagated, but a variety of other local affections of a specific natnre, which are usually complicated with inflammation^ although they may perhaps, in some cases, be independent of it. Inflammations, however, are certainly capable of great diversity in their nature, and it is not to be expected, that any mechanical theory can do more than to afford a probable explanation of the most material circumstances, which are common to all the different species. Besides these general illustrations of the nature of fevers and inflammations, the theory which has been explained

602 AN ESSAY West Indies, coming into a colder climate, are peculiarly liable to the attacks of these diseases. Dr. Hunter, how- ever, observes, that notwithstanding this exemption in favour of the natives of the West Indies, a residence in this climate appeared to be of no manner of advantage to persons, who were already affected by incipient consumptions when they arrived there. We cannot doubt the accuracy of this evi- dence, as far as regards the facts, which came immediately under Dr. Hunterâ€™s observation ; they principally related to the military, who perhaps laboured under some peculiar dis- advantages j but other practitioners have given much more favourable reports of the events of cases, in which they have made trial of the effect of a residence in this climate ; and if we may be allowed to draw any inference from the qualities of a climate, as indicated either by the thermome- ter, or by its effects on the constitutions of the inhabitants, there can be little doubt that a residence in Bermudas, in a temperate and sheltered part of Jamaica, or in some other of the West India islands, together with the equable qualities of the sea air, to which the patient must be exposed during the voyage, must present every advantage, towards the re- covery of a consumptive person, that climate alone can pos- sibly bestow. In other diseases, the effects of climate are perhaps less exclusively beneficial; although it appears that gouty persons often derive considerable benefit from a residence in the hot- test countries, as in the East Indies, or at Ceylon in parti- cular. Dr. Gregory seems to be persuaded that life may be lengthened, and the inconveniences of old age retarded or mitigated, by repeated emigrations into warmer and warmer climates, after the age of 50 or 60, according to circum- stances : and he thinks that even posterity may be bene- fited by an emigration of this kind. In wdiatever situation the residence of an invalid may be fixed, it is of no small importance that the aspect and ex-

Microscopical fallacies, I shall here take the liberty of inserting some remarks, which I cannot attempt at present to render intelligible to any, who have not entered into the minutest refinements of physical optics : to such as are unacquainted with the latest investigations, I fear they must appear involved in a degree of obscurity almost enigmatical. When a small object is viewed in a microscope, especially if the light is admitted by a limited aperture, it will often appear to be surrounded by some lines of light and shade, or of colours, which might be supposed to depend on its mag- nitude, in the same way that the eriometrical colours are de- rived from the magnitude of the objects examined. In re- ality, however, their existence and their dimensions depend on the aperture of the microscope, and not on the magnitude of the particles in its focus. To prove that this aperture may produce such an effect, hold any object, for instance, the finger or the nail, so as to intercept all the light of a candle, except a narrow line, and this line will seem to project other lines parallel to it into the adjoining shade. Now these lines depend on the interposed object on one side, and on the margin of the pupil on the other ; for if we take an object a little narrower than the pupil, we may see them on both sides of it; and causing the pupil to contract by throwing more light on the opposite eye, they will expand, as the space, through which they are admitted,-is diminished by the con- traction. We may also very distinctly observe, if we look in this manner at a narrow line of light instead of a candle, that the dispersive powers of the eye manifestly convert its image on the retina into a spectrum of red, green, and blue light; sufficiently confuting the conjectural hypothesis of the achromatic property of its refractive substances. If again we substitute a minute hole or slit in a card for the inter- posed object, the sides of this aperture will now determine the magnitude of the fringes which are seen at the edge of

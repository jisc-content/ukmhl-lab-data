626 ON THE FUNCTIONS observable from the effect of cold, and in the first impres- sion produced by a cold bath : nor is it impossible, that such a contraction may exist in the cold fit of an inter- mittent. although it seems more probable that a debility of the heart is the primary cause of this affection. Besides these general causes of derangement, which ap- pear to be more or less concerned in different kinds of fever, there are other more partial ones, which seem to have a similar relation to local inflammations. The most obvious of these changes are such as must be produced by partial dilatations or contractions of the capillary vessels; since, as I have endeavoured to demonstrate, any supposed de- rangement in the actions of the larger vessels must be ex- cluded from the number of causes which can materially affect the circulation. It cannot be denied, that a diminu- tion of the elastic, or even of the muscular force of the small arteries, must be immediately followed by such a dis- tension as will produce a resistance equal to the pressure : the distension will occasion an increase of redness, and in most cases pain : the heat will also generally be increased, on account of the increased quantity of blood which wdll be allowed to pass through the part; and since the hydrostatic pressure of the blood acquires greater force, as the artery becomes more distended, it may be so weak as to continue to give way, like a ligament which has been strained, until supported by the surrounding parts. In this state a larger supply of blood will be ready for any purposes which re- quire it, whether an injury is to be repaired, or a new sub- stance formed ; and it is not impossible, that this change in the state of the minute vessels may ultimately produce some change in the properties of the blood itself. The more the capillary arteries are debilitated and dis- tended, the greater will be the mean velocity of the circula- tion ; but whether or no the velocity will be increased in the vessels which are thus distended, must depend on the extent of the affected part; and it may frequently happen

618 ON THE FUNCTIONS dilated ; and deducting from this height the five feet which express the actual pressure in the arteries of a dog, the re- maining one hundred and eighty five feet will give a velocity of at least fifty four feet in a second, for the propagation of the pulse in the dog. It is not however ascertained, that all the membranes, which may have surrounded the artery in this experiment, are called into action in its ordinary puls- ation, much less that the force, developed by their tension, varies precisely according to the general law of perfectly elastic bodies: but this mode of calculation is still amply sufficient to make it probable, that the velocity of the pulsations, in the larger arteries, must amount to at least forty feet in a second, although some very considerable de- ductions must be made, on account of the resistances of various kinds, which cannot beâ€™ comprehended in the calcu- lation. The artery must not be supposed to subside, immediately after each pulsation, precisely to its original dimensions, since it must remain somewhat fuller, in order to supply the capillary arteries, and the veins, in the interval between the two successive pulsations ; and in this respect it differs from the motions of a wave through a canal, which is open on both sides : but the difference may be understood, by supposing a partial reflection of the pulse to take place at every point where it meets with any resistance, which will leave a gene- ral distension of the artery, without any appearance of a retrograde pulsation. I shall proceed to inquire, in the third place, into the nature and extent of the functions which are to be attributed to the muscular fibres of the coats of the arteries ; and I ap- prehend that it will appear to be demonstrable, that they are much less concerned in the progressive motion of the blood, than is almost universally believed. The arguments, jvhich may be employed to prove this, are nearly the same that I have already stated, in examining the motion of a fluid, carried along before a moving body in an open canal; but

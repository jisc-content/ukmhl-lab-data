20 ON.THE STUDY whether a physician’s patients die or recover under his care.” But in the first place, it is obviously impossible, that the public should ofiTain any extensive or accurate knowledge whatever of the history or event of any great variety of cases, that occur even to a physician already eminent; and in the second place, if such a detail were before the public, it would often surpass the utmost sagacity of the best informed medical men themselves to determine, how far the event of each case was unavoidable, and how far it depended on the treatment. This uncertainty may be illustrated by the example of the very candid Dr. Brown, who has lately examined, with great apparent accuracy, the records of a public institution, conducted by men of the highest celebrity in their profession, and has thought himself under the disagreeable necessity of inferring from them, that the course of fever is nearly, if not fully, as tedious and as severe, when treated by the best established remedies, as when wholly left to nature. Happily however for the credit of physic, this conclusion appears, upon proper consideration and calculation, to be completely unwarranted by the registers from which he has deduced it. In fact the results of about 300 cases of fever, admitted into the infimary in question, may be very simply stated in this manner. The mean duration of the whole disease was 12 days : the mean time of admission was between the 6th and 7th day; but the mean duration of those cases, which were admitted at the commencement of the disease, was somewhat less than 9 days. Hence it may be inferred, not only that the duration was shortened at least 3 days by the early employment of medical agents ; but also that this difference was the effect of a difference of only 3j days in

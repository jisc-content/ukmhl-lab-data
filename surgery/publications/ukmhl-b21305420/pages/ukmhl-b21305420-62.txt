APHORISMS so CHAPTER VIII. Of specific differences. ยง 256. A perfect name includes a generic and a specific name. All solid learning in natural history, agriculture, and medicine, depends on the knowledge of species. 257. A legitimate specific name or character distinguishes the species from all others of the same genus. Trivial names, often called specific names, are subjected to no very accurate rules. All specific characters, which distinguish the species from others, not of the same genus, are superfluous and bad. Trivial names are only limited to a single word. [Substantives have an advantage over adjectives, as being more convenient, when brevity is required ; for instance, aphis acetosae, sphinx flipendulae. Dr. Bostock is mistaken in thinking that the principles of nomenclature, adopted by naturalists, entirely prohibit the use of single names on all occasions ; and with this opinion most of his objections to the London pharmacopoeia fall to the ground. It would be convenient if every disease, which requires to be distinguished in a popular work, or an official report, could be designated by a single appellation either generic or specific : but this cannot always be effected; nor is it always done in natural history.] 259. Specific characters must be taken from circumstances not subject to vary. 260. Magnitude affords no specific distinction. [Thus the degree of putrescency scarcely affords a sufficient distinction between nervous and putrid fever.] 261. Comparisons with other genera are to be excluded from specific characters. 262. Comparisons with other species of the same genus are bad. 283. Care must be taken to exclude varieties from the rank of species. 284. Each species must bear the name of the genus. 285. The specific name must always follow the generic.

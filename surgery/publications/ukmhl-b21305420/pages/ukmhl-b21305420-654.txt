ON THE FUNCTIONS 622 vena cava is also capable of assisting the passage of the blood into the auricle. It is not at all improbable that a muscle of involuntary motion, which had been affected throughout the whole period of life by alternate contractions and relaxa- tions, might retain from habit the tendency to such con- tractions, even without the necessity of supposing, that the habit was originally formed for a purpose to be obtained by the immediate exertion of the muscular power : but in fact the partial pulsation of the vena cava is perfectly well cal- culated to promote the temporary repletion of the auricle, which it must retard, for a moment, the column which is ap- proaching, at a time that it could not be received. [See the note from the Edinburgh Journal.] There is no difficulty in imagining what services the mus- cular coats of the arteries may be capable of performing, without attributing to them any immediate concern in sup- porting the circulation. For since the quantity of blood in the system is on many accounts perpetually varying, there must be some means of accommodating the blood vessels to their contents. This circumstance was very evident in some of Halesâ€™s experiments, when after a certain quantity of blood had been taken away, the height of the column, which mea- sured the tension of the vessels, frequently varied in an irregular manner, before it became stationary at a height proportional to the remaining permanent tension. Haller also relates, that he has frequently seen the arteries com- pletely empty, although in some of his observations there was probably only a want of red globules in the blood which ' was flowing through them. Such alterations in the capacity of the different parts of the body are almost always to be attributed to the exertion of a muscular power. A partial contraction of the coats of the smaller arteries may also have an immediate effect on the quantity of blood contained in any part, although very little variation could be pro- duced in this manner by a change of the capacity of the larger vessels.

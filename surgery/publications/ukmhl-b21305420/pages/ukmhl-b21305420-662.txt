Thus it may be shown, that any diminution of the tension of the arterial system must be propagated from the point at which it begins, as from a centre, nearly in the same man- ner, and with the same velocity, as an increase of tension, or a pulsation of any kind would be propagated. Hence the effect of venesection must be not only more rapidly, but also more powerfully felt in a neighbouring than in a distant part: and although the mean or permanent tension of the vessels of any part must be the same, from whatever vein the blood may have been drawn, provided that they under- go no local alteration, yet the temporary change, produced by opening a vein in their neighbourhood, may have relieved them so efl'ectually from an excess of pressure, as to allow them to recover their natural tone, which they could not have done without such a partial exhaustion of the neigh- bouring vessels. But since it seems probable, that the mi- nute arteries are more affected by distension than the veins, there is reason in general to expect a more speedy and ef- ficacious relief in inflammations, from opening an artery than a vein : this operation, however, can seldom be performed without material inconvenience; but it is probably for a similar reason, that greater benefit is often experienced from withdrawing a small portion of blood by means of cup- ping or of leeches, than a much larger quantity by vene- section, since both the former modes of bleeding tend to relieve the arteries, as immediately as the veins, from that distension, which appears to constitute the most essential characteristic of inflammation. In a case of haemorrhage from one of the sinuses of the brain, a very judicious phy- sician lately prescribed the digitalis : if the effect of this medicine tends principally to diminish the action of the heart, as is commonly supposed, it was more likely to be injurious than beneficial, since a venous plethora must be increased by the inactivity of the heart; but if the digitalis diminishes the general tension of the arteries, in a greater proportion than it affects the motion of the heart, it may pos-

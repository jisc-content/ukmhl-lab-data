ON CLIMATES. 591 From December to February. London Edinburgh Paris 39.7“ 36.7 36.8 January. London, 1814, 8 and 3 Penzance, M. S. 1814, 8 and 2 28.8" 37.4 It appears from this comparison, that none of the situations here enumerated. North of Lisbon, except Penzance, has any material advantage over London in the mildness of its winter. The best parts of Devonshire seem to be about a degree and a half warmer; Torquay however may perhaps be a little milder than this ; the account, which was kept at Ilfracombe, must have been taken from a thermometer in a confined or a sunny situation. But Penzance may be fairly considered as having a temperature 4^" higher than London in the coldest months ; nor are the journals here employed the only which allots such a superiority to the climate of this extremity of our island. [Dr. Forbes says that taking No- vember, December, and January together, London is 5° colder than Penzance, (p. 11); but instead of 39" and 44" (p. 13) the true means are 39.7" and 44", giving a ditference of 4.J.* only for the years compared, which seem, however, to have been a little too favourable to Penzance.] It is remark- able, that temperature of the three coldest months is the same at Paris as at Edinburgh, being, in both these cities, about three degrees lower than in London. There are probably particular spots on the coast of Hampshire or Sussex, which, from their sheltered situation, must be considerably less sub- ject to the effect of the Northern and Eastern winds, than most other parts of the island ; and Hastings, or its neigh- bourhood, may perhaps be reckoned among the most eligible of these ; but the further we go up the channel, the more

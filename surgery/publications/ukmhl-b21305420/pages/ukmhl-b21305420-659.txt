62T OF THE HEART AND ARTERIES. 2 s 2 that the velocity may be much more diminished on account of the dilatation of the space whicli the blood is to occupy, than increased by the diminution of the resistance. And on the other hand, the velocity may be often increased, for a similar reason, at the place of a partial contraction. Hence we may easily understand some of the experiments which Dr. Wilson has related in his valuable treatise on fevers : the application of spirit of wine to a part of the membrane of a frogâ€™s foot contracted the capillary arteries, and at the same time accelerated the motion of the blood in them, while in other parts, where inflammation was present, and the vessels were distended, the motion of the blood was slower than usual. Another species of inflammation may probably be occa- sioned by a partial constriction or obstrnction of the capillary arteries, which must indeed be supposed to exist where the blood has become wholly stagnant, as Dr. Wilson in some instances found it. This obstruction must however be ex- tended to almost all the branches, belonging to some small trunk, in which the pressure remains nearly equal to the tension of the large arteries ; for in this case it will happen, that the whole pressure will be continued throughout the obstructed branches, without the subtraction of the most considerable part, which is usually expended in overcoming the resistances dependent on the velocity ; so that the small branches will be subjected to a pressure, many times greater than that which they are intended to withstand in the natural state of the circulation ; .whence it may easily hap- pen that they may be morbidly distended ; and this dis- tension may constitute an inflammation, attended by redness and pain. Nor is it impossible, that obstructions of this kind may originate in a vitiated state of the blood itself, al- though it would be difiicult to prove the truth of the con- jecture; it seems, however, to be favoured by the observa- tion of Haller, that little clots of globules may often be observed in the arteries, when the circulation is languid, and that they disappear when its vigour is restored, especi-

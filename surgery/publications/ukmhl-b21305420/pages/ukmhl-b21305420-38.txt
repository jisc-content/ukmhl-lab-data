6 ON THE STUDY that genius, without which all possible knowledge is insuf- ficient to make a genuine and complete physician. “ A man can be neither a philosopher nor a physician,’^ says Herz, ‘‘ by imitation or by rules, but by native genius alone.’’ The inestimable advantage of a naturally acute judgment and delicate discrimination is no where more striking, as Freind has remarked, than in the profession of physic. 3. Of all this the most convincing proofs will imme- diately occur to us. Medicine not only comprehends so very extensive a range of knowledge, but its truths are often so profound and so much concealed from a cursory inspection, so intricate, so much disguised, distorted and obscured by a multitude of delicate and invisible causes, that nothing less than the all commanding eye of the most enlightened under- standing, than the all penetrating and all searching power of genius, can possibly recognise that which is hidden in dark- ness, can follow that which is remote into the last traces that it imprints, can distinguish certainty from opinion and probability, can separate the essential from the accidental, and finally can analyse and develope every subject of inves- tigation so completely, as to leave no further doubt respect- ing any of its properties, which are cognisable by human means. 4. Nor does any art, except that of war, require so much intrepidity, courage, and promptness in judging and in acting, as the art of physic. How often does the life of a patient depend on the decision of a moment! This precious moment, the timid physician, who is discomposed, and stupefied, and confused, by the unexpected appearance ol danger, by unforeseen circumstances of doubtful import.

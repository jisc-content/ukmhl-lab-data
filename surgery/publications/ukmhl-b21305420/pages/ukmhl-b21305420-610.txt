578 REMARKS ON The dust or seed of the lycoperdon bovista he finds to be of an inch in diameter; this substance gives very distinctly 3.5 on the scale of the Eriometer; and 3.5X85000zz^9750. The globules of the blood measured ; and immediately afterwards, when examined in the same state by the Erio- meter, indicated about 6^; and 6.5 X490Oz:31860. A wire of platina, obtained by a very ingenious method, peculiar to Dr. Wollaston, measured -y-jVcjJ when coiled up, gaven. 9 of the Eriometer; and 9 X 3200:1128800. The mean of a consi- derable number of comparative observations on fibres of wool, between n. 20 and 30, afforded also 28800 for a product. A mean of these experiments gives very nearly for the unit of the scale of the Eriometer. Some former inves- tigations had led me to attribute to this unit a value somewhat smaller, especially for the lowest numbers; and I had ob- tained a formula, and made a table, for ascertaining the true dimensions of any substance measured by the instrument, ac- cording to the result of these investigations; but since my later experiments seem to have superseded the mode of cal- culation which I had adopted, I think it unnecessary to in- sert the table here. Having sufficiently ascertained the true value of the indica- tions of the eriometrical scale, I shall now enumerate the measurements of the principal substances which I haxe ex- amined with the instrument.

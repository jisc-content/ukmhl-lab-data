598 ■ AN ESSAY t^iis proportion seems to be much too great for a tolerably hfealthy city; and on the whole it does not appear that Dr. Price’s observations can by any means be adniitted as conclusive. With respect to the evidence atforded by the prevalence of diseases, it has been observed by Dr. Gregory, that removing from a colder to a warmer cli- mate may be beneficial, even in those diseases to which the inhabitants of the warmer climate are subject; but if they appeared to be equally or more subject to any disease than the inhabitants of the colder, there would surely be little encouragement for the change ; for instance, in a person supposed to be liable to diseases of the liver, it would surely be injudicious to undertake a voyage to a hot climate, with a view of avoiding the chance of taking cold, since the Avell known frequency of hepatitis, in such climates, Avould much more than counterbalance any prospect of advantage from the change. The frequency of consumptions is decidedly greater in cold than in hot climates, but not by any means in exact pro- portion to the depression of the mean temperature. The principal situations, that require to be compared with the metropolis, as a standard, are the South of England, the South of Europe, the islands of the Mediterranean, Madeira, and the West Indies. There do not appear to be any precise accounts of the pro- portionate mortality from consumption at any place upon the Southern coasts of this island, on a scale sufficiently extensive for the comparison, but there is abundant reason to think that such reports would be greatly in favour of the salubrity of these coasts, more so indeed than any conclu- sions, that we should be at all authorised to form, from such thermometrical observations, as have hitherto been com- pared. A greater number of registers is still wanting to obtain sufficient evidence for the inquiry : and it would be desirable that some journal should be kept at one of the

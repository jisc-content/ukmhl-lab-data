APHORISMS 28 223. Generic names of hybrid origin, for instance partly Greek and partly Latin, are to be rejected. 224, 225. Generic names including other generic names are unworthy of a scientific nomenclature. 226. Generic names ending in oides are prohibited. 227. Generic names, derived from others by the addition of a syllable, are disapproved. 228. Generic names very nearly resembling each other are likely to cause confusion. [For instance, Synochus and Synocha. In fact words formed for one language should be capable of being translated into another, so as to retain their sense, independently of any termination, which must be peculiar to a single language, or to others most nearly related to it.] 229. Generic names not derived from Greek or Latin are forbidden [220]. Some barbarous words, approaching in their forms to classical ones, are however allowed. 230. Generic names, which have been common to the dilferent kingdoms of nature, are to be confined to one sense. 231. Generic names common to natural history and anatomy, pathology, therapeutics, or the arts, are to be avoided. [Thus lichen must not be a genus of diseases: and I have been obliged to change the name spiloma into spilosis, having found that the botanists had taken possession of this also.] 232. Generic names contradicting the properties of some of the species are bad. 233. Generic names must not be identified with those of natural classes or orders. 234. Diminutives and derivatives of a similar nature are allowable as generic names. [The diminutives of other generic names are however scarcely admissible.] 235. Adjectives are inferior to substantives as generic names.

589 ON CLIMATES. theoretical comparison of climates. Moisture is supposed, by some, to be favourable, by others, to be unfavourable, to such persons : it may therefore be safely neglected, except as tending to increase the evils depending on a want of equa- bility of temperature. The effluvia of moist ground are suf- ficiently well known as the causes of paludal fevers; further than this they require no particular investigation. Nor can we attempt to assign any reason for peculiarities, which ren- der some situations preferable to others, for some individuals only, labouring under a given disease, as asthma ; which is sometimes induced by the atmosphere of cities, and some- times of the country ; and which is occasionally mitigated by a residence in places having no marked distinctions from such as are less favourable to it, as Kensington, and perhaps some others. In the hotter seasons, there are few diseases, and few con- stitutions, which would require a climate milder than our own : in the colder, an increase of the facility of circulation, which heat appears to afford, may often be beneOcial, partly perhaps as exciting perspiration, and partly as preventing too great a congestion of blood in the internal parts of the body. The mean temperature of the six winter months is therefore the first point of comparison, that requires our attention, and such a comparison may easily be derived from the registers, w’hich are usually kept in circumstances nearly similar.

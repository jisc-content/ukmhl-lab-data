542 A SKETCH OF bile; and that when the bile is present in the stomach, it is always in consequence of disease. The division, which Everard Home has supposed to exist in the human stomach, does not appear in itself to be highly probable : but his experiments on the two kinds of absorp- tion, whieh are observable in fluids entering the stomach, and on the functions of the spleen, will lead, if they be con- firmed by future investigations, to the most important results. The chyme, having acquired, by some such means, a proper consistency, enters the duodenum, and there meets tlie bile; which seems to be decomposed by it, not being found as bile in the contents of the intestines, but having its proper sub- stance changed into a yellow or greenish fatty matter like spermaceti, which affords the dark colour. That the pre- sence of the bile is not however absolutely necessary for the formation of chyle, is proved by cases of jaundice, in which the discharge of bile has been interrupted for one, two, or more weeks, and yet the person has not died for want of nourishment. The chyle is separated from the insoluble part by the operation of the absorbents ; but in order that the mass may not remain dry, the chyle is gradually washed out of it by the intestinal fluid, w hich is successively poured out and reabsorbed, until at last the whole is extracted. What Vauquelin and Sage have done on this subject is not very accurate. Einhof and Thaer have minutely examined the dung of cattle; and I have found that, in the human sub- ject, I of the contents are aqueous, holding in solution the salts commonly found in the blood, a certain quantity of phos- phate of magnesia, and the peculiar extractive animal mat- ter, besides a small portion of undecompounded bile. The solid part contains all that is undissolved or precipitated, to- gether with the mucus in which it is involved. The experiments of Vauquelin, on the quantity of earths of different kinds consumed and excreted by fowls, seem to show, in conjunction with some other experiments on vege-

641 ON PALPITATION. remaining two or three days in this state, she died on the 3d of February. Upon examination after death, there was no appearance of any thing like aneurystn in any part of the arterial sys- tem ; the heart was a little enlarged, and some of its valves, especially those of the pulmonary artery, were much ossi- fied, so that the free passage of the blood was impeded: there was a considerable quantity of fluid in the pericardium j in the right cavity of the thorax, and in the ventricles of the brain, but little or none on the left side of the chest: the liver was of a dark colour, but otherwise natural. The ossi- fication may possibly have originated from some rheumatic inflammation, at an early period of the disease, and probably occasioned the palpitation, either by its immediate irritation, or by causing an accumulation of blood. I estimated the water in the cavity of the thorax, as amounting to about a pint. Dr. Harrison thinks it was much less ; but as all the dropsical symptoms had subsided, in a great degree, during the latter period of the disease, and with them the palpi- tation in the neck, there is reason to suppose, that the effu- sion into that cavity had formerly been much more consider- able. CASE II. Esther Shakespear was affected, at the time of her admis- sion into St. Georgeâ€™s Hospital, in the course of last winter, with symptoms much resembling some of those, which have been described in the case of Lydia Smith ; the beating in the neck was very evident, and appeared to be equally in- dependent of arterial or venous pulsation ; but since it af- fected both sides equally, it did not afford the same kind of evidence respecting the transmission of the palpitation from the heart. There were, however, abundant symptoms of ascites and general dropsy, combined with hydrothorax, and all these were repeatedly subdued by draughts, consisting of *2 T

But whatever may be the merit of the German physic, it exists as a written system, and may be learned from books exactly as it is delivered from the professorial chairs. In practical anatomy the great cities of the continent have some advantages even over London; but these advantages are of such a nature, as to affect the purse of the student more materially than the progress of his studies. At the same time it cannot be questioned that the hospitals of Paris, and especially of Vienna, may afford, at a proper period, much that is highly worthy of a young physician’s observation. After a first winter spent in Edinburgh, and a summer employed in botany, chemistry, and other preliminary studies, with the interposition of such occasional relaxation as the necessary travelling may easily he made to afford, the next winter ought to be devoted to practical anatomy in London: and this study, together with that of physiology, will occupy very properly the student’s whole time. As the spring advances, he must become a pupil of an hospital, which must continue to be his principal and daily object at every subsequent period, while practical lectures on physic, surgery, midwifery, and the materia medica, should be attended with diligence, whatever branch of the profession he has chosen for his particular occupation; for however necessary it may be to separate the different departments of practice, no part of the elementary or preliminary studies

OF THE HEART AND ARTERIES. 615 tered nearly in the same proportion, as far as we are capable of estimatiug the quantity, which was probably contained in the larger Tessels of the animal. Hence it follows, that the velocity of the pulse must be nearly the same as that of an impulse transmitted through an elastic fluid, under the pres- sure of a column of the same height, as that which measures the actual arterial pressure: that is, equal to that which is acquired by a heavy body falling freely through half this height. In man, this velocity becomes about fifteen feet and a half in a second ; to which the progressive motion of the blood itself adds about eight inches ; and with this velocity, of at least sixteen feet in a second, it may easily happen that the pulse may appear to arrive at the most distant parts of the body without the intervention of any very perceptible interval of time. The velocity of the transmission of the pulse being known, it is easy to determine the degree in which the arteries are dilated during its passage through them. The mean velocity of the blood in the aorta being eight inches and a half in a second, its greatest velocity must be about three times as much, since the contraction of the heart is supposed to occupy only about one third part of the interval between two succes- sive pulsations; and if the velocity of the pulse is sixteen feet in a second, that of the blood itself must be about one eighth part as great; so that the column of blood occupying eight inches may occupy only seven; hence the diameter must in- crease in the ratio of about fifteen to sixteen. The tension will also become one eighth greater, and the force of the heart must be capable of supporting a column of one hundred and one inches. The force would, however, require to be somewhat increased, from the consideration that the force re- quired at the end of any canal during the reflection of a pul- sation or wave of any kind, is twice as great as the force exerted during its transmission, and the force employed in the origination of a wave or pulse in a quiescent fluid, is the same as is required for its reflection; on the other hand, a weaker pulsation, proceeding into a narrower channel,

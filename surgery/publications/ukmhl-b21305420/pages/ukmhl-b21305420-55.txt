II. APHORISMS 11ELA.TING TO CLASSIFICATION extracted principally from THE PHILOSOPHIA BOTANICA OF LINNE'. CHAPTER VI. Of generic characters. ยง. 151. The foundation of methodical science consists of two parts, arrangement and nomenclature. 152. Arrangement is either theoretical, relating to classes, orders, and genera, or practical, relating to species and varieties. 153. Arrangement or method is either synoptical or syste- matic. 154. A synopsis depends on arbitrary divisions, proceeding in pairs at each step, and is not admissible in botany, except as a key or index. 155. A system proceeds in its arrangement by five steps; classes, orders, genera, species, and varieties, A synopsis in 5 steps extends only to 32 varieties; a system may comprehend 100 000, if each division contains 10 members. 156. System is the Ariadnean thread, without which all is confusion. 157. Species in natural history are supposed to have been originally created distinct. 158. Varieties may be as numerous as the individuals which have been produced. [It is however only such varieties, as are in some measure hereditary, that require to be particularly noticed.]

VI. REMARKS ON THE MEASUREMENT OF MINUTE PARTICLES, ESPECIALLY THOSE OF THE BLOOD AND OF PUS, 1. On the form and magnitude of the particles of the blood. The form and magnitude of the coloured particles of the blood is a subject not only interesting and important in it- self, but is also capable of assisting, by means of comparative observations, in the determination of the magnitude of the capillary arteries, and the investigation of the resistance which they exhibit; it may also be of advantage to obtain some tests capable of ascertaining, whether these [particles undergo any change in diseases of various kinds, and what is their relation to the globules of pus, and of other animal fluids: hitherto the measures of the particles of blood, which have been considered by various authors as the most accurate, have differed no less than in the ratio of 2 to 5 ; and there is an equal degree of uncertainty respecting their form, some admitting the truth of Mr. Hewsonâ€™s opinions, and a greater number rejecting them without any satisfactory evidence. In such examinations, it is only necessary to employ a full and unlimited light, in order to obtain a very distinct outline of what appears manifestly to be a very simple substance, and we thus seem to have the clear evidence of the senses against Mr. Hewson ; but we must remember, that where the substances to be examined are perfectly transparent, it is only in a confined and diversified light tha't we can gain a correct idea of their structure. The eye is best prepared for the

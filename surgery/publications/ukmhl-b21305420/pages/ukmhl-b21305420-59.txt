ON CLASSIFICATION. 27 would be to have about 12 divisions at each step. But it must be remembered that we have been proceeding on the supposition of characters variable at pleasure, so as to be accommodated to the convenience of classification: while in reality such an accommodation is only practicable in a very moderate degree; since we are often bound to follow a method much less regular, wherever there are any traces of a natural arrangement, capable of afibrding facility and stability to our system.] CHAPTER VII. Of names, §. 218. He who establishes a new genus is bound also to give it a name. [This must be my apology, for the introduction of a greater number of new words, than I should have wished to employ without such a necessity.] 219. A generic name must be decided on before a specific one is formed. 220. No man in his senses would employ a generic name destitute of etymological meaning. Barbarous words are considered as destitute of meaning. [This canon, though perfectly consistent with classical elegance, and though of great utility for the assistance of the memory, is disapproved by some good judges, as leading to imaginary hypotheses respecting the nature of the thing named : for myself, I see no great danger from such miscon- ceptions, and I am therefore disposed to adhere to the Linnean rule. Thus the term myringa, arbitrarily given by Sennert to the membrane of the tympanum, is deserve«dly forgotten.] 221. Generic names, consisting of two entire and separate words, are prohibited. 222. Generic names, consisting of tw o Latin words united together, are scarcely to be tolerated. Such compounds of Greek origin, on the contrary, are elegant.

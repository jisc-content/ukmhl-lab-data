ON THE STUDY 8 of mankind and of the world. Without this knowledge, he will be subject to err at every step that he takes, and will be in perpetual danger of injuring and disgracing the pro- fession which he follows. Without this, he will every where find impediments insuperable to all his learning: all his in- formation will be useless, obscured, disputed, or misunder- stood, if he raises prejudices and excites disgust, by an im- friendly, obstinate, inflexible, ungraceful, inconsiderate, stiff*, coarse, or bashful behaviour; and his embarrassment will perpetually disturb the free operation of his faculties, and impede the application of his knowledge. It is the physicianâ€™s duty, to take every man, who entrusts himself to his care, as he is, with all his failings, and to treat him in such a man- ner, as to obtain his confidence, and to fulfil his wishes. Men of all classes and ranks in life, of all dispositions, ca- pacities, characters, and opinions; in every imaginable situa- tion, of every age, constitution, and temper, have equal claims to his assistance and his attention. He must know how to give every one his due; and wherever his profession calls him, how to adapt his conduct to the circumstances in which he finds himself. The wisdom, the selfdenial, the grace, the dignity, the decency, the noble frankness and openness of heart, the accommodating disposition and agree- able manners, which are required of him, can only be ob- tained by means of a good education, united with oppor- tunities of becoming acquainted with the world, and habits of intercourse with society. It is extremely to be lamented, that young men of the best families, who must be supposed to have the advantage of the most refined education, seldom devote themselves to the study of physic. To this remark, Great Britain affords some exceptions; but, as far as I know, they arc scarcely to be found in any other country.

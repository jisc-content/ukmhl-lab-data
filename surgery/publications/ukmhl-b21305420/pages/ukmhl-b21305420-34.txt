ON THE STUDY 2 pretensions. However inadequate the possession of superior talents alone may be to insure the confidence of the public, it must be a mistaken opinion, although it has been asserted by persons of no ordinary observation, that a man of great abilities is morally incapable of being a good ^ physician; and that even the most acute powers of mind would, in the practice of physic, become so effectually blunted by constant intercourse with nurses and invalids, as to lose all their original advantages. Dr. Radcliffe, who might have been esteemed a competent judge, told Dr. Mead, as a great secret, that the true way to succeed in physic was to use every body ill: but Dr. Mead used nobody ill, and succeeded better than Dr. Radcliflfe. It is well to be familiarised to such paradoxes as these^ in order to be prepared for the lesser contradictions and mortifications which will sometimes occur to the most fortunate practitioners. In fact there is no study more difficult than that of physic : it exceeds, as a science, the comprehension of the human mind : and those who blunder onwards, without attempting to understand what they see, are often very nearly on a level with those, who depend too much on imperfect generalisations, applied to facts, which can scarcely be subjected to any well marked analogy. Hence it may happen, that talents and labour may become useless for want of a proper direction : although, if they had been confined to the simple track of patient and detached observation, wâ€™hich alone is witliin the scope of the more humble practitioner, they must at least have ascertained each fact with more care and greater precision than the mere empiric, and in all probability must have made some combinations of experience, which would have been bene- ficial to mankind and honourable to themselves.

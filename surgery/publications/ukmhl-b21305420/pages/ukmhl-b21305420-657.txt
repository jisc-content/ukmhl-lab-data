OF THE HEART AND ARTERIES. 625 in the uervous and muscular system, which is not likely to lead to any disease of the vital functions. When the quan- tity of the blood transmitted by the heart is smaller than in health, the arteries must be contracted, until their tension becomes only adequate to propel the blood, through the ca- pillary vessels, with a proportionally smaller velocity, and the veins must of course become distended, unless the muscular coats of the arteries can be sufficiently relaxed to afford a diminished tension, which is probably possible in a very limited degree only. In this state the pulse must be small and weak, and the arteries being partly exhausted, there will probably be a paleness and chilliness of the extremities : until the blood, which is accumulated in the veins, has suffi- cient power to urge the heart to a greater action, and per- haps, from the vigour w Inch it may have acquired during the remission of its exertions, even to a morbid excess of activity. Hence a contrary state may arise, in which the quantity of blood transmitted by the heart is greater than in perfect health ; the pulse will then be full and strong, the arteries being distended, so as to be capable of exerting a pressure sufficient to maintain an increased velocity, and to overcome the consequent increase of resistance ; a state which perhaps constitutes the hot fit of fever; and which is probably some- times removed in consequence of a relaxation of the extreme arteries, which suffer the superfluous blood to pass more easily into the veins. Such a relaxation, when carried to a morbid extent, may also be a principal cause of another ge- neral derangement of the circulation, the motion of the blood being accelerated, and the arteries emptied, so that the pulse may be small and weak, while the veins are overcharged, and the heart exhausted by violent and fruitless efforts to restore the equilibrium ; and this state appears to resemble, in many respects, the affections observed in typhus. When, on the contrary, the capillary vessels are contracted, the arteries are again distended, although without the excess of heat which must attend their distension from an increased action of the heart, and possibly without fever: an instance of this appears to be exhibited in the shrinking of the skin,which is frequently 2 s

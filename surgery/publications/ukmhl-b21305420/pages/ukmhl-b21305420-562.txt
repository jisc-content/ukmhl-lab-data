A SKETCH OF 530 however, be confessed, that if these experiments have been correct, it is very difficult to understand how this extraordi- nary expenditure of carbon is to be replaced ; since, besides the consumption for other purposes, respiration alone must require the carbon contained in at least 8 or 10 pounds of food in the day, which is much more than is usually taken. Notwithstanding that the changes, which the blood under- goes in the lungs, are in all appearance similar to those, which take place when it is simply agitated in common air or oxygen, still the nervous system appears to have an in- fluence over the process, without which it cannot be carried on. Dupuytren divided the 8th pair of nerves, near the oesophagus, in horses and in dogs, and observed that the animal, though its respiration w as unimpaired, soon died for want of oxygenization. When an artery was opened, and the nerve on one side was divided, the arterial blood became darker for a few moments, but then resumed its red colour; if the nerves were divided on both sides, the blood remained venous, and the animal died, while the red colour of the lips and nostrils became black. If, instead of dividing, he only compressed the nerves, the arterial blood became dark, and remained so, as long as the compression was continued, but resumed its scarlet colour as soon as the compression was removed. These experiments sufficiently prove the influ- ence of the nerves on the change of the blood in the lungs, supposing them to have been accurately performed. It is however well known that Baglivi and Bichat made similar experiments, and drew from them conclusions totally oppo- site to those of Dupuytren. Ducrotay de Blainville, a coun- â€¢ tryman of Dupuytren, has also repeated his experiments, and found that though the animals actually die some time after the division of the 8th pair of nerves, their death is by no means produced by the prevention of the change occa- sioned in the blood by respiration. This has been further examined by Emmert, with all the accuracy which is re- quired for a good experimenter. Pie has fully shown, that the division of the 8th pair of nerves has no immediate in-

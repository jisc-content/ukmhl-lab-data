I have thought it necessary to enter into this examination of the facts advanced by Dr. Brown, which have hitherto been generally considered as authorising the inferences that he has drawn from them, because the discussion appeared to be essential to the conclusion of an essay like the present: since if it were true that the medical science of the most celebrated professors could effect so little, under circumstances so favourable, as he has supposed, the public would have scarcely any motive left for encouraging a pursuit so fruitless, nor an individual for devoting himself with zeal and enthusiasm to the attainment of knowledge, where nothing further than doubt and difficulty could reasonably be anticipated. It is our duty not to depreciate the advantages of which we are actually in possession ; and while we use our utmost exertions for the improvement of our profession, and for the interests of humanity, we must not omit to assign their proper value to the few steps, which the labours of ages have in reality

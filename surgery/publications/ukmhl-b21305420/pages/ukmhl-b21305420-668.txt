It may indeed be supposed, that the pressure of the water acts, in this case, merely by forcing the abdominal viscera higher up towards the thorax, and leaving the great arteries more exposed to the touch; but, if I am not mistaken, such a dis- placement of the viscera would be inadequate alone to ac- count for the distinctness, with which the pulsation may sometimes be felt, especially when the action of the heart has been accelerated, as by swimming, or otherwise. But, without adverting further to this indirect effect of a surrounding fluid, I shall attempt to deduce from the un- deniable efScacy of a fluid contained in a cavity, in trans- mitting an impulse through it, an explanation of some very anomalous appearances, which sometimes accompany palpi- tations of the heart; and which, not being completely understood, have led on the one hand to a mistaken idea of the existence of aneurysm, and, on the other, to a false opinion of the total independence of the motions of the dif- ferent parts of the arterial system, immediately continuous with each other. In the case of Lydia Smith, a further account of which will be subjoined, principally from the notes obligingly com- municated by Dr. Harrison, a palpitation was observed in the right hypochondriac region, and on the right side of the neck, which exhibited a vibratory motion, more rapid and less regular than that of the pulse felt at the wrist; and a similar vibration was observable in the heart itself: the pulsation in the neck was not confined to the jugular veins; it was more forcible and extensive than it could have been, if it had originated from those vessels ; and it had more the appearance of a violent throbbing of the carotid artery, although, in the axillary artery, the pulse was comparatively regular and natural. Hence it was at first inferred, by some judicious and experienced observers, that there must be an aneurysm in the ascending branch of the aorta, w hich occa- sioned the irregularity in the action of the carotid, but of

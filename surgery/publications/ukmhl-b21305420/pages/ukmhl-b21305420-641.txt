OF THE HEART AND ARTERIES. 609 It may be supposed that the heart throws out, at each pul- sation, that is about seventy five times in a minute, an ounce and a half of blood : hence the mean velocity in the aorta becomes eight inches and a half in a second ; and the velo- city in each of the succeeding segments must of course be smaller, in proportion as the joint areas of all the corres- ponding sections are larger than the area of the aorta: for example, in the last order of vessels, of w'hich the diameter is the eleven hundredth of an inch, the velocity will be one ninety third of an inch : and this result agrees sufficiently wrell with Hales’s observation of the velocity in the capillary arteries of a frog, which was one ninetieth part of an inch only. It is true, that Haller is disposed to question the accuracy of this observation, and to attribute a much greater velocity to the blood flowing through the capillary vessels, but he did not attempt either to measure the velocity, or to determine it by calculation : nor is this the only instance in which Haller has been led to reason erroneously, from a want of mathematical knowledge: he may, however, have ob- served the particles of blood moving in the axis of a vessel with a velocity much exceeding the mean velocity of its whole contents. If we calculate upon these foundations, from the formula which I have already laid before the So- ciety, it will appear that the resistance which the friction of the arteries would occasion, if water circulated in them in- stead of blood, with an equal velocity, must amount to a force equivalent to the pressure of a column of fifteen inches and a half: to this we may add about a fourth for the resist- ance of the capillary veins, and we may estimate the whole friction, for water, at twenty inches. The only consider- able part of this force is derived from the term ^ in the value of^: this term increases for each successive seg- ment in the ratio 1 : 1.49425 = 1 : and the sum of the series is to the first term, as to 1. It appears also, n—1 that a very small portion only of the resistance is created in the larger vessels : thus, as far as the twentieth division, at 2 R

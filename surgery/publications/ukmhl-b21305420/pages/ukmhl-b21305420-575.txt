ANIMAL CHEMISTRY. 543 tables, that these earths must be composed and decomposed in different ways, as may be required for the processes of organic life. Chyle, from its colour, and its coagulating when boiled, was for a long time compared to milk, and supposed to con- tain a large portion of sugar of milk : but this erroneous hypothesis is now corrected. In the thoracic duct, the milky appearance is less conspicuous, since it is diluted by the lymph of the lymphatic absorbents, and it is commonly of a yellow grey colour ; it coagulates in the air, and the coagulum acquires by degrees a red colour. Hence there is reason to believe that the whitish substance, suspended in the chyle, is the colouring matter in an imperfect state, re- quiring the contact of the air in order to be completed. The experiments of Halle, Emmert, and Reuss agree in showing that chyle, in every thing but its colour, resembles blood, but is much more diluted. From Fourcroyâ€™s doctrine, that the colour of the blood depended on the subphosphate of iron, it necessarily followed that the colouring matter con- tained in the chyle must be in the state of albumen, united with neutral phosphate of the protoxyd or oxydiole of iron, which, upon entering into the mass of the blood, was ren- dered a subphosphate by the alkali of the blood, while the protoxyd was changed in the lungs into an oxyd; but since this salt of iron cannot be discovered in the colouring matter, this erroneous conjecture falls to the ground. The intimate nature of the liver and spleen has been little investigated ; but the liver exhibits properties resembling those of the bile, and when spontaneously decomposed, under certain circumstances, it readily changes to a fatty matter like spermaceti. 9. Bones, The combustible part of the bones was shown by Papin, Herissant, Lassone, and particularly Haller, to be cartilaginous, and to be capable of affording gelatin by boil-

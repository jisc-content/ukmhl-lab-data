. ON THE FUNCTIONS 612 doubted whether the analogy, derived from these experi- ments, can be safely employed as a ground for asserting, that so large a portion of the arterial pressure is employed in overcoming the resistance of the very minute arteries. But it must be remembered, that these experiments are at least conclusive with respect to the arteries larger than the tubes employed in them, and even to those which are a little smaller; so that the remaining pressure, as observed in ex- periments, can only be employed in overcoming the resist- ance of the minuter arteries and veins; and these observa- tions tend therefore immediately to confirm the analogy drawn from the experiments on the motion of water. It might indeed be asserted, that the viscidity of the blood exceeds that of water in a much greater ratio than that which is here assigned ; but this is rendered improbable by some experiments of Hales, in which, when the intestines were laid open, on the side opposite to the mesentery, so that many of the smaller arteries were divided, the quantity of warm water which passed through them, with an equal pressure, was only about twelve times as great as that of the blood which flows through them in their natural state ; and it is probable, that at least three or four times as much of any fluid must have passed through them in their divided, as in their entire state, unless we suppose that the coats of the divided vessels, like many other muscular parts, are capable of being contracted by the contact of water. In some other experiments, it was found that a moderate de- gree of pressure was capable of causing water to exude so copiously through the exhalant vessels of the intestines, that it passed through the aorta with a velocity of about two inches in a second, although these vessels do not naturally allow any passage to the blood : on the other hand, it some- times happened that very little water would pass through such channels as naturally transmitted a much larger quant- ity of blood : a circumstance which Dr. Hales very judicious- ly attributes to the oozing of the water into the cellular membrane surrounding the vessels, by means of which they were compressed, and their diameters lessened.

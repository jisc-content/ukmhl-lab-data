REMARKS ON 572 investigation, bj beginning with the blood of a skate, of which the particles are so conspicuous, and of so unequivocal a form, as to set aside at once the idea of a simple homo- geneous substance. They are oval and depressed, like an almond, but less pointed, and a little flatter; each of them contains a round nucleus, which is wholly independent in its appearance of the figure of the whole disc, being sometimes a little irregular in its form ; seldom deviating from its cen- tral situation, but often remaining distinctly visible while the oval part is scarcely perceptible; and as the portion of blood dries away, becoming evidently prominent above the thinner portion. This nucleus is about the size of a whole particle of the human blood, the whole oval being about twice as wide, and not quite three times as long; the nucleus is very transparent, and forms a distinct image of any large object which intercepts a part of the light by which it is seen, but exhibits no inequalities of light and shade, that could lead to any mistake respecting its form. But if we place some particles of human blood under similar circumstances, near the confine of light and shade, although they are little, if at all, less transparent, we immediately see an annular shade on the disc, which is most marked on the side of the centre on which the marginal part appears the brightest, and con- sequently indicates a depression in the centre, which Dela- torre mistook fora perforation. It is most observable when the drop is drying away, so that the particles rest on the glass: and when a smaller particle is viewed, it has merely a dark central spot, without any lighter central space. Nor have the particles ever appeared to me as flat as a guinea,‚Äù although their axis is sometimes not more than one third or one fourth of their greatest diameter; if they Avere much thinner than this, their diameter would be more diminished than it is when they become spherical, by the effect of an aqueous fluid : while this form corresponds to a diminution to about of the original diameter. They may indeed possibly absorb a part of the surrounding moisture in the change : but they do not seem to have their dimensions much

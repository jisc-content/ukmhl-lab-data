ON CLIMATES. 603 posure of the house, which he occupies, should be selected with a view to the qualities of climate which he is desirous of obtaining. We have an illustration of the truth of this remark, in an observation recorded by Dr. Garrick, respect- ing the influenza of 1803. One of the most open and ex- posed of the buildings on Clifton hill is Richmond terrace, which forms three sides of a parallelogram, fronting respec- tively the East, South, and West; on the East side, not one family, and scarcely an individual, escaped the complaint, while on the South side, a great majority, both of persons and families, in all other respects similiarly circumstanced, escaped it entirely.‚Äù Such facts as these are among the few which afford solid grounds for medical reasoning, and they deserve the more attention, as they relate to circumstances of continual occurrence, and of perpetual influence on our health and comfort; and in proportion as both the medical and the meteorological sciences become founded on a firmer basis, it cannot be doubted that their beneficial effects will be more and more experienced, as well in the preservation of health, as in the treatment and cure of diseases.

G.^7 0\ PALPITATION. \ M’hich the effects were not sufficiently powerful to disturb the natural transmission of the blood through the axillary artery. Such a state of the circulation appeared to me^ however, from the physical investigations of the motion of the heart and arteries, which I have detailed in the Philosophical Transactions, to be absolutely impossible; and this convic- tion led me to a repeated and minute examination of the peculiar symptoms. I then found, upon making strong pres- sure on the right side of the neck with a single finger, that the motion of the carotid artery was very perceptible, and totally independent of that of the superficial parts, being precisely synchronous with the pulse at the wrist, although it required considerable attention to distinguish it from the more irregular palpitation. Hence it became clear, that one half of the supposition, which I was combating, was erro- neous, the pulsation of the axillary artery not being at va- riance with that of the carotid ; and that the other half was without evidence, the existence of an aneurysm not being capable of explaining a beating, independent of the arteries. I have divided, in my Medical Literature, p. 182, the species,cordis^ into two varieties, A, affecting the pulse, a disease of the ventricle and J3, not affecting the pulse, probably of the auricle; the more common.” The disease, in this case, could only be referred to the second variety : and it could only be supposed, that a fluid, preternaturally accumulated within the thorax, transmitted the effect of the irregular action of the auricles, by which the whole heart, and the parts in contact with it, were agi- tated, up to the membranes and integuments, in the neigh- bourhood of the clavicle, on the one side, and down to the abdominal viscera on the other : and it was easy to explain the occurrence of the palpitation on the right sid(; of the neck and abdomen, so much more distinctly than on the left, by considering the effusion of water as confined, in great measure, to the right cavity of the thorax. 1 he justice of this opinion was completely evinced by the examination

ON CLIMATES. 397 diseases are fatal. Thus when we find, that in Stockholm the annual deatlis amount to of the population, in London TT* Pays de \aud to and in some villages in diflferent parts of Great Britain to only, or even less, we cannot hesitate to consider a residence in the country as gene- rally more healthy, than in a metropolis similar to either of those cities; although it cannot fairly be concluded that the healthiness is precisely in the proportion which might be in- ferred from this comparison, until we have considered how far the eflfect of emigration to a great town may influence the ap. parent mortality. After the age of 8 or 10, th(> probable duration of life may be estimated with sufficient accuracy, as Demoivre has very ingeniously shown, by assuming that, of a certain number of persons born together, one will die annually until the whole number is become extinct; and it is well known, that this number may in common cases be supposed to be 86 ; so that at any given age, for instance 36, we may find the probable duration of life by deducting it from 86, and halving the remainder, which will give us 25 for the estimate required ; and if this law were universally true from the time of birth, it is easy to show that the mortality in a metropolis would always be increased by the accession of settlers ; so that if, for example, the whole population were supplied by settlers at 20, and all children were sent to a neighbouring village to be educated, the mortality of the town, instead of would become 1; (43—10)= and that of the village would be 1: (86—10) and that any partial changes of a similar nature would cause a smaller alteration of the appa- rent salubrity, in proportion to their extent. But the mor- tality during infancy is actually much greater than is assumed in the simple hypothesis of Demoivre, and from this circum- stance, as well as from the frequent return of aged persons into the country, Dr. Price has inferred that emigration in gene- ral has no tendency to increase the mortality of cities. In reality the question depends altogether upon the mortality which may be supposed to take place within the first year, which is often estimated at one third of the births; but

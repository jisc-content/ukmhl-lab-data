ANIMAL CHEMISTRY. 527 difference is so much the more remarkable, as it is precisely the reverse of what would be expected, from the compara- tive nature of the usual food of men and of oxen. Perhaps this circumstance may be greatly illustrated by the results of future investigations respecting the elementary or compound nature of nitrogen. In the capillary vessels, the coloured particles of the blood become darker, and possibly the colourless parts in the lym- phatic arteries may undergo some analogous change. Pro- bably the fibrin penetrates with the serum into these colour- less vessels, although it would be difficult to collect their contents in a sufficient quantity for analysis. The chemical nature of the bloodvessels has been little examined, except that Bichat has subjected their membranes to the effects of maceration. The fibrous membrane of the arteries, without doubt the most remarkable of all, has long been considered as composed of cylindrical muscles. Haller was of this opinion, and founded on it his doctrine of the pulse, which is still taught in our elementary works. The idea was, however, rejected by John Hunter, and Bichat endeavoured in vain to produce in the arteries of living ani- mals any perceptible effect, by the strongest chemical and mechanical stimuli; whence he argued, that the pulse de- pended on the effect of the heart only, producing a loco- motion in the arteries, without any dilatation. My experi- ments have proved, that these fibres cannot possibly be mus- cular, since muscular fibres are soft and flaccid, containing more than | of their w eight of humidity, while those of the arteries are dry, and quite elastic, and since the muscles agree in their chemical properties with the fibrin of the blood, being soluble in acetic acid, and entering into combinations of difficult solubility with muriatic and nitric acids, while the arterial fibres, on the contrary, are insoluble in vinegar, but are dissolved pretty easily in the diluted mineral acids, and not separated from them either by simple or prussiated alkalis, which are the precipitants of fibrin, [as well as of

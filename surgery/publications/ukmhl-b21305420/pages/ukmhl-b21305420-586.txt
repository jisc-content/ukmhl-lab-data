A SIC ETCH OF 55i which is precipated by sublimate, is, besides albumen, which is very probably present in a state of disease, a peculiar ex- tract nr mucilage, which is not soluble in alcohol, but, like that which is soluble, always accompanies the lactic acid and its salts. It is not precipitated from the recent fluid, as long as it contains an excess of acid; and perhaps this circumstance is concerned in the precipitation by sublimate in the case of fever. Besides these substances, which were before unknown, I found also some silica, which, in a very few cases, I have also detected in calculi. This earth prob- ably exists in all the fluids of the body in very minute quantities; it is derived from the water employed in cook- ing and for drink, and not being separable by any processes carried on within the body, must be found in the fluid excretions. The experiments of Cruikshank, Nicolas, Sorg, Thenard and Bostock have shown that the product of diabetes is liable to considerable variation ; that the sugar formed is easily destroyed in chemical operations, and that it cannot be dis- covered in the blood. I have found it in one case wholly wanting, where the urea had altogether disappeared. After evaporating the fluid in a gentle heat, a brown substance was dissolved in abundance by alcohol, and afforded a stiff extract; it contained the lactic acid, with a little trace of lactate and muriate of ammonia, but consisted almost entirely of the animal extract which accompanies the lactates, was o precipitated by tannin, and left after combustion a little muriate of soda, which showed a slight trace of uncombined alkali. Rouelle, Fourcroy, Vauquelin, Brande, Chevreul and others have analysed the urine of various animals ; and per- haps we may consider as belonging to this subject the ana- lyses of a mass of fowlsâ€™ dung from the South Sea, called guano, which have been executed by Fourcroy, Vauquelin, and Klaproth, who found a large portion of uric acid in it. Brande thought that he found it in the camel, and Vauque-

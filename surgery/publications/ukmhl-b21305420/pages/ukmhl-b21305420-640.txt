ON THE FUNCTIONS 608 cording to the measurements of Keill and others, we may take I of an inch for the usual diameter of the aorta, and suppose each arterial trunk to be divided into two branches, the diameter of each being about ± of that of the trunk, (or more accurately 1 : 1.26 i= iQ—and the joint areas of the sections about a fourth part greater, (or 1.2586 : 1 ~ 10099896). This division must be continued twenty nine times, so that the diameter of the thirtieth segment may be only the eleven hundredth part of an inch, that is, nearly large enough to admit two globules of the blood to pass at once. The length of the first segment must be assumed about nine inches, that of the last, the twentieth of an .inch only ; and supposing the lengths of the intermediate seg- ments to be a series of mean proportionals, each of them must be about one sixth part shorter than the preceding, (or 1 : 1.1961 zz 10 —-07776)^ mean length of the whole forty six inches, the capacity to that of the first segment as 72.71 to 1, and consequently the weight of the blood con- tained in the arterial system about 9.7 pounds. It is pro-- bable that this calculation approaches sufficiently near to the truth: for the whole quantity of blood in the body being about 40 pounds, although some have supposed it only 20, others no less than 100, there is reason to believe that half of this quantity is contained in the veins of the general cir- culation, and that the other half is divided, nearly in equal proportions, between the pulmonary system and the remain- ing arteries of the body, so that the arteries of the general circulation may contain about nine or ten pounds. Haller allows 50 pounds of circulating fluid, partly serous, and partly red, and supposes i of this to be contained in all the arteries taken together : but in a determination which must be in great measure conjectural we cannot expect perfect accuracy ; and according to Haller’s own account of the proportions of the sections of the arteries and veins, the large trunks of the veins appear to be little more than twice as capacious as those of the arteries, and the smaller branches much more nearly equal, so that wc cannot attribute to the arterial system less than of the whole blood.

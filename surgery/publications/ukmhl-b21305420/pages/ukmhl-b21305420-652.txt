ON THE FUNCTIONS (m happens, the velocity produced would be only about ^ as much; and if the contraction were only to which is a sufficient allowance for the smaller arteries, about lo^^only of the actual velocity in the aorta could be produced in this manner, even upon a supposition much more favourable to the muscular action of the arteries than the actual circum- stances. A small addition must be made to the force re- quired for producing the retrograde motion, on account of the friction to be overcome, but the general reasoning is not affected by this correction. The contraction of the artery might also be supposed to remain after each pulsation, so that the vessel should not be again dilated until the next pulsation, or, in other words, a spontaneous dilatation might be supposed to accompany the pulsation, instead of a contraction : but such a dilatation would be useless in promoting the progressive motion of the blood, since a larger quantity of blood, conveyed to the smaller vessels, without an increased tension, would be in- effectual with respect to the resistances which are to be overcome. It is possible indeed that the muscular fibres of those arteries in which the magnitude of the pulse is sensible, like the fibres of the heart, may be inactive, or nearly so, during their dilatation, and that they may contract after they have been once distended, with a force which is in a certain degree permanent; the greater momentum of the blood, which accompanies the dilatation, enabling it to enter the minute arteries with equal ease, although assisted by a tension somewhat smaller: so that the same mean velocity maybe sustained, as if the arteries were simply elastic, and a little smaller in diameter, with a very little less exertion of the heart. But the distribution of the blood could never be materially diversified by any operation of this kind : for if any artery were for a moment distended by such a variation, so as to exceed its natural diameter by one hundredth part only, a pressure would thence arise equivalent to that of a column about two inches high, which would, in spite of all Â»

REMARKS ON 574 transparent, is the most easily detected by looking through them at a small luminous object, either directly or by re- flection, as, for example, at the image of a candle seen at the edge of a portion of the fluid, held in a teaspoon ; in this case, wherever there are small particles in suspension, for instance, in milk diluted with water, they will produce a minutely tremulous or sparkling appearance, which is rendered still more distinct by the assistance of a lens, and which depends on the diversified interception of the light, while the particles are carried over each other by the in- ternal motion of the fluid. This test is applicable to all cases of minute particles held in suspension; where however the greater number of the particles are nearly equal in di- mensions, the luminous object viewed through them exhibits a much more striking appearance, for it is surrounded by rings of colours, somewhat resembling those of the rainbow, but differently arranged, and often beautifully brilliant. The blood, a little diluted, always exhibits them in great /perfection, and they afford a very accurate criterion for the distinction between pus and mucus : mucus, containing no globules, affords no colours, while those which are exhibited by pus exactly resemble the appearance produced by the blood, the rings being usually of the same dimensions: whence it follows that the globules are also of the same size, for the dimensions of the rings vary with those of the par- ticles which produce them : and there can be little doubt, from this circumstance, that the globules found in pus are the identical globules of the blood, although probably some- what altered in the process of suppuration. A minute quan- tity of the fluid to be examined in this manner may be put between two small pieces of plate glass, and if we hold the glass close to the eye, and look through it at a distant candle, with a dark object behind it, the appearance, if the globules are present, will be so conspicuous as to leave no doubt re- specting their existence.

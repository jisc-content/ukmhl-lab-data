The greatest possible equability of temperature seems how- ever to be obtained in a sea voyage to a warm climate, in which the variation seldom amounts to half as much as in the most favourable situation on shore, even on a small island ; and in pulmonary cases, the motion of a ship would probably, in general, be rather beneficial than otherwise, while the fatigue of travelling in bad roads, and the danger of sleeping in damp beds present an alternative, by no means favourable to a journey by land. The direction of the wind alone can seldom have any im- mediate effect on the salubrity of the climate, except by variously modifying its temperature, according to the seas or countries over which it blows. There is a method of com- puting the mean direction of the wind, which does not ap- pear to have been hitherto adopted, but which affords a very simple and intelligible result, although somewhat laborious, if extensively applied. It consists in finding the bearing and distance of a point, to which a light body would be carried by the wind in the course of the year, supposing the velo- city to be constant, when its variations have not been ascer- tained by observation. It is obvious that the bearing of such a point will show at once the mean direction of the prevalent winds; and its distance, compared with the effect of a con- stant wind for the same time, as a unit, will indicate the degree in which those winds have prevailed. ,Prevalence of winds.

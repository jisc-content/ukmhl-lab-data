AN ESSAY 600 of the continents which surround them, at least as far as we can judge by their affording a climate of that description, which seems to be the most desirable ; for actual experience will not allow us to be too confident of obtaining success, even from a residence in these. Dr. Domeier informs us, in his very interesting account of the island of Malta, that the thermometer seldom varies here more than 6® in the 24 hours, or stands below 51°, even in the depth of winter; while in Lisbon he has seen ice, and both ice and snow in Naples ; besides that, in these two cities, the difference between day and night often amounts to 20°. If an invalid leaves England in the middle of August, the voyage lasts about a month, and is often of itself highly beneficial, so that he arrives at Malta, in time to be fully prepared to be further benefited by the mild winter; it appears, however, from the more particular account which Dr. Domeier else- where gives of the temperature, that it continues throughout October rather higher than is altogether desirable, being seldom below 70” throughout that month ; and in a country where there is scarcely any visible foliage, walls occupying universally the place of hedges, this cannot be a matter of perfect indifference. [As far as I have been able to judge from a very super- ficial comparison, in the course of a single summer, I should prefer Pisa or Leghorn, to any other parts of Italy : Naples is supposed to have an atmosphere too sulfureous for weak lungs ; and to be liable to keen winds in the winter: Rome has perhaps too many temptations to imprudent exposure in visiting its curiosities : otherwise it has many advantages for a winter’s residence . but I should suppose it more liable to currents of wind than Pisa; and if Pisa were too near the mountains, it might easily be exchanged for Leghorn, which I found much cooller than Pisa in hot weather, and which would probably be milder in cold. I also found that Rome was much hotter than Naples in the summer, and I should expect it to be at least as much colder in winter.]

ANALYSIS OF CINCHONA, 570 galls, a yellowish white precipitate. The parts deposited during evaporation, dissolved in boiling water, do not pre- cipitate gelatin or tartar emetic, but retain the property of affording a green colour with iron, and a precipitate with infusion of galls. By these properties cinchona may be dis- tinguished from other substances, which may approach to it the more nearly as they possess more of them : coffee, for example, has only one of the properties, that of giving a green colour with iron. Some such substances may, per- haps, be employed with advantage instead of bark; for instance, besides the alburnum of the pine, the willow and ash bark, the geum, the cascarilla, the tormentil, the bistort, and the bark of the padus. The ash not being astringent, I have sometimes added to it some tormentil and ginger, with which it made an excellent tonic, and even, according to the experiments of some of my friends, seemed to cure quartan agues. 2. The syrup contained in bark is intolerably bitter, and is, in all probability, very materially concerned in its medi- cal effects. Some of the bark brought from Brasil contains it so abundantly, that it overcomes altogether the ordinary taste of bark. 3. The cinchonate of lime much resembles the malate, but is not precipitated by lime water, nor by neutral acetate of lead. Vauquelin has called the yellow syrup like acid, which is obtained from it, the cinchonic : the characters of this acid have a very strong resemblance to those of the lactic. 4. The mucilage of bark is precipitated by acids and by alcohol, but not by tannin ; it does not afford jelly. 5. The fibrous portion is probably less abundant at the internal surface of the bark, and this part might perhaps be separated, with some advantage, for medical use.

25 ON CLASSIFICATION. 187. An essential character affords a singular and appro- priate criterion of the genus. Its excellence depends on its brevity. 188. A factitious character distinguishes the genus only from others of the same artificial order. 189. A natural character contains every thing remarkable that is found in all the species of the genus. It may often require alteration when new species are discovered. 190. Aiâ€™actitious character is a substitute for an essential one, which is always the best when it can be obtained. A natural character is a work of great labour, but, when completed, it is the basis of all systems, the guardian of genera, and is applicable to every correct and practicable mode of arrangement. 193. No character can be infallible unless it has been compared with all the species of the genus. 198. A generic character must not contain comparisons, except with things perfectly well known. 199..201. The character must be expressed in select, accurate, distinct, and compendious terms, sufficient in number, but not superfluous. A proper and correct use of terms has preserved anatomy, mathematics, and chemistry from barbarism : the want of it has been highly pernicious to medicine. 202. The character must remain invariable in every possible system that can be adopted. With this precaution, the introduction of a new system is no misfortune. 203. A genus may consist of a single species, although it more usually contains several species. 204. What is established respecting the characters of genera must be understood, with some latitude, of those of classes. 205. Classes are more arbitrary than genera, orders than either. 206. The more naturally classes are established the better. 207. Great difficulty arises from the excessive length or number of classes and orders.

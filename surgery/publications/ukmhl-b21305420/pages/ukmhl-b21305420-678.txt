646 A LETTER TO THE EDITORS OF A rangement. You object to my conversion of generic into trivial names ; but, in fact, if we wish to find a disease from its name only, we must look for it in an index, and then it is of no importance whether the name is generic or trivial; if from its nature and symptoms, we must consult the defi- nitions, and the alternative remains equally indifferent. When you say that I have made a classification of names, and not of diseases, I am utterly incapable of comprehend- ing your meaning, nor can I easily believe that you had yourselves any distinct idea of what your words were in- tended to express. You assert that my genera are founded on forced analogies ; but in proof of this assertion you ad- duce no argument, and scarcely even an example, except in the case of the arrangement of the Aphtha of Cullen as a typhus, in which, though with some hesitation, I have fol- lov/ed Dr. Crichton : on this occasion you very concisely and I suppose satisfactorily answer my note of interrogation by a note of admiration^ and there the illustration ends. That the mildest and most terrible of diseases are the children of one family,” is certainly not more unnatural than that an equal diversity should occur in the same in- dividual disease, that is, in the same species ; for instance, no fever can be slighter than some cases of scarlatina, and none can be more inevitably fatal than others. You dis- approve my having melted down Dr. Willan’s orders into genera ;” but I had the pleasure to find, in conversation with that respectable author before his death, that he him- self considered it as a very proper adaptation of his partial method to a more extensive system, which he had the good- ness to say he considered as extremely neat, and altogether unexceptionable ; indeed it is impossible to read his account of what he calls species, without perceiving that a great number of them are mere varieties of the same disease. Almost all the instances of apparent repetition, that }ou have pointed out, relate to cutaneous diseases, in wliicli, as 1 have expressly observed, 1 have tliought it better to follow Dr. ^Vi]lal^s arjungement with very little alteration,

So far, therefore, is it from being the duty of a physician always to follow the footsteps of nature, that it is often necessary for him to take a directly opposite course, and oppose her efforts by every means in his power. EXTERNAL SENSES. SENSE OF FEELING. This sense is common to every part of the nervous sys- tem ; in some places, however, it is much more acute than in others ; for instance, in the skin, and especially at the points of the fingers.

Hence it is so frequently conjoined with many diseases, and is often more intolerable than the disease itself. A moderate degree of pain stimu-

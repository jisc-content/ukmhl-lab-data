100 or fall, and the patient is of a full habit of body, it will be proper to take away blood, giving him at the same time a couple of table-spoonfuls of the following mixture, every two or three hours: Take Infusion of Roses 8 ounces; Diluted Sulphuric Acid 30 drops; Purified Nitre ^ drachm: Using some gentle purgative, such as castor oil, Epsom salts, &c., every second or third day, to keep the body open. Should the discharge of blood continue after these measures, astringent medicines, such as those used in spitting or vomiting of blood, may be given; be- ginning with those of the mildest kind; and, to allay irritation, from a quarter to half a grain of opium may be given every four or six hours. When the discharge of blood is a consequence of stone in the bladder, kidney, &c., it is only to be cured by removing the offending cause; but as this is not always practicable, we should be satisfied with moderating the symptoms, and making them as mild and tolerable as possible; for which purpose, the patient should drink co- piously of mucilaginous drinks, such as barley water, solution of gum arable, decoction of marsh- mallows; and he should take small and repeated doses of opium, combined with cooling medicine, as advised under the head of spitting of blood. \

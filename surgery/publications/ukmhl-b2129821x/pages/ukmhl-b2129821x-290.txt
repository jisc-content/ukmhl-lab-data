228 The disease seldom appears before the ninth month, and very rarely shows itself after the se- cond year of a child's age. It comes on slowly; and the first appearances of it to be observed are, flaccidity of the flesh, wasting of the body, pale- ness and loss of colour in the cheeks, if they have been of a rosy complexion, a slight swell- ing of the face, &c. &c. The child is listless, and miwilling to exert itself on the least occa- sion, and is unable to walk. The appetite is often not much impaired, but the stools are un- usually frequent and loose, and the belly appears uncommonly full and tumid. With respect to the faculties of the mind, the understanding is generally very mature, but in a few cases stupi- dity and fatuity ensue. There is fever at the commencement of the disease; but in its more advanced stage, a frequent pulse, with other symptoms of a hectic nature attend. In some cases the disease proceeds no further, and the child gradually recovers its health and strength; the limbs being left, however, in a distorted state. In others it continues to increase, till at length every function of the animal economy becomes afifected, and the scene is closed in death. The cure of rickets depends upon invigorating the system, by bracing up the solids, promoting digestion, and the formation of good chyle.

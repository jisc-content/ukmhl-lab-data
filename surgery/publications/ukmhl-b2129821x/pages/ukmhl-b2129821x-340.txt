278 TIC DOLOUllEUX, OR PAINFUL AFFECTION OF THE NERVES OF THE FACE. This is one of the most painful chronic com- plaints to which the human frame is subject.* The principal relief in this disease has been derived from the operation of dividing some of the nerves of the face. This will keep off the pain for the space of three, or four months'; when, from the reunion of the divided nerves, it returns with all its pristine violence. The best medical treatment we are now ac- quainted with is, the exhibition of the carbonate of iron. The world is indebted to Mr. Hutchin- son, an eminent surgeon in Nottingham, for this valuable discovery. Mr. has published a work on * Sir Astley Cooper, Bart., in hi.; lecture (April 15), observed, that " The pain experienced by those afflicted with Tic Doloureux is indescribable ; it is of the most acute and distressing kind. I have seen it cause the tears to trickle down the cheeks a fine old weather-beaten naval officer, a man who had fearlessly faced the cannon's mouth." " It is in general like the pain of electricityâ€”patients will exclaim ' Oh! I had a shock at tliat moment.' It pro- duces a kind of flickering through the nerves ; its motions are like summer lightning, and the pain cannot be com- pared to anything more appropriate than the horrid sen- sations created by electric shocks."

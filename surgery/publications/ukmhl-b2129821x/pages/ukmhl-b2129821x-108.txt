Strong purgatives, also, on this ac- count, should be avoided. The difficulty of breathing and oppression at the chest will be best relieved by a large blister immediately over the part affected; and if there be nausea or inclination to vomit, a gentle eme- tic may be administered; but, where this is not the case, antimonial medicine, as directed in inflam- mation of the lungs. To procure a perspiration, and in order to keep up a constant effect, they should be repeated every two or three hours, the patient, at the same time, drinking plentifully of luke-warm liquors, such as barley-water, &c. Costiveness may be removed by clysters, or gentle laxatives; such as manna, lenitive electuary, Epsom salts, &c. Throughout the course of this disease, as in all those of the inflammatory kind, abstinence from animal and high-seasoned food must be strictly enjoined. Where much weakness pre- vails, or where the patient has long been accus- tomed to a free use of fermented liquoTs, a small quantity of wine or porter may be allowed.

72 cation of a blister, where the pain is settled in one particular part, and not accompanied with much inflammation, may be of sei-vice; or the part may be rubbed with some stimulating lini- ment, such as the camphorated spirit, with a fourth part of the solution of ammonia added to it. But, if the pains be of the wandering kind, shifting from one joint to the other, this will not be of any use. Warm fomentations, in the acute form of rheumatism, should not be employed, as they are found to increase rather than assuage the pain. f-* When the external inflammation and pain suddenly subside, and the disease attacks the head, heart, lungs, or stomach, so as to endanger the life of the patient, blisters should be applied in the neighbourhood of those parts where it originally existed, to counteract the effect of its translation to another part. Poultices to the joints, after bleeding with leeches, where the joints are painful and swell much, renewed morn- ing and evening, are serviceable in allaying the pain; e. g.â€”- Take Rye Flour 1 pound ; Stale Beer, or Vinegar 4 ounces ; Muriated Natron 2 ounces : work them up into a paste, and apply on linen round the joint.

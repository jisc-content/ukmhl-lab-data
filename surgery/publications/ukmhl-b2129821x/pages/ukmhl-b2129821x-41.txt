xxxi most be applied to correct morbific or diseased dispositions, and to obviate various particulars which were shown to be remote or possible causes of diseases. From the way in which the several temperaments are commonly men- tioned by systematic writers, it would seem as if they meant that every particular constitution could be referred to one or other of the four ; but this is far from being the case, since by much the greater number of people have temperaments so indistinctly marked, that it is difficult to say to which of the temperaments they belong. When we actually meet with people who either have, 1st, Too much strength and rigidity of fibre, and too much sensibility ; 2nd, Too little strength and yet too much sen- sibility ; 3rd, Too much strength, and but little sensibility; 4th, or but little sensibility joined to weakness, we should consider such people as more or less in the valetudinary state, who require that these diseased dispositions should be particularly watched, lest they fall into those diseases which are connected with the different temperaments. FIRST CONSTITUTION. Those who have too much strength atid rigidity of fibre, and too much sensibility, being liable to suflfer from conti- nued fevers, especially of the inflammatory kind, their scheme of preserving health should consist in temperate living, both as regards diet and exercise; they should studiously avoid immoderate drinking, and be remarkably cautious lest any of the natural discharges be checked. People of this habit bear evacuations well, especially bleeding : they ought not, however, to lose blood but when it is really required that the quantity should be lessened ; because too much of this evacuation would be apt to reduce the constitution to the second-mentioned temperament, in which the strength is deficient, but where sensibility is redundant.

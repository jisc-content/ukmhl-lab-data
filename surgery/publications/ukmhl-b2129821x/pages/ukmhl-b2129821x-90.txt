28 Treatment.â€”In the treatment of this com- plaint, if the inflammation run high, the pulse be quick and hard, with difficulty of breathing, 12 or 14 ounces of blood ought to be draw from the jugular vein, (supposing the patient to be a grown person), in preference to the arm; but if the symptoms do not run high, it will be sufficient to draw blood by applying several leeches under the ears, particularly on the affected side. At the commencement of this disease, and be- fore fever sets in violently, an emetic, given in time, often proves useful, and not unfrequently checks its complete formation. The bowels must be kept free by the occasional use of ape- rient medicine. Where the inflammation is severe, the early application of a blister or a mustard poultice round the throat, or to the back of the neck, has been attended with the most decided benefit; but in slight cases it may suffice to rub the parts twice or three times a-day with some camphor liniment, putting a piece of flannel round them afterwards. It is also of service in this complaint to wash the mouth and fauces with mildly-astringent gargles, somewhat sharpened with some acid j and also to scrape and cleanse the tongue.

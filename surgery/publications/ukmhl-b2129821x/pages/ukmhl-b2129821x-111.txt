49 to be applied over the stomachj or cupping may be adopted, if preferred. A large blister may next be applied, and the cure assisted by fomenting the whole of the belly, as well as by administering frequent soothing and laxative clysters.* A warm bath will prove beneficial; and bathing the feet in warm water is also recom- mended. In consequence of the irritable state of the stomach, it will not retain medicine; and it is only after the violence of the pain and the fre- quency of vomiting are abated, by the preceding treatment, that opiates can be given, even in the form of clysters. But when the disease is some- what brought under, opium may be given this way, as well as internally, in small doses. The stomach may be sheathed from any acrimonious substances coming in contact with it, and which may have caused the inflammation, by the pa- tient taking small draughts of some mild diluent drink, such as chicken broth, linseed tea, or barley-water, in which a small quantity of gum arable has been dissolved. When, however, the nature of the offending matter is known, the proper specific remedies may be resorted to, (See Poisons.) * See Appendix* D

XXV / DISORDERS OF RESPIRATION. Kespiration may be obstructed from various causes, seated either in the lungs tliemselves or the surrounding parts. But from vvliatever cause this obstruction may arise, it undoubtedly produces all those diseases which proceed from an interrupted circulation. The lungs themselves also being at length compressed, and not suffered suffi- ciently to dilate, cannot throw off the vapour which arises from them; hence they are frequently oppressed with moisture. At the same time they are irritated, so that a greater quantity of mucus, and that of a thicker kind than usual, is secreted; by which means the passages through which the air enters them, are stopped up, till a violent cough at length throws off the load. There are other dis- orders also of the respiration, such as cough and sneezing, which, though at first sight they may seem very dangerous, are not destitute of use, and may even be reckoned among the most salutary attempts of nature to relieve patient. Often, however, they are attended with danger^ or very great imeasiness ; namely, when they are either too violent or exerted in vain. It is necessary, nevertheless, for a physician to know the nature, causes, and effects of these, that he may be enabled to promote them when necessary, and to stop them when they are hurtful or useless, COUGH. Cough consists in a violent, frequently Involuntary, and sonorous expiration, suddenly expelling the air with great force through the glottis* somewhat contracted, the con- vulsion of the muscles serving for expiration gives a great force to the air, while the contraction of the glottis produces the sound. It is often long continued, being repeated at certain intervals, during each of which the inspiration is *Tlie Â»uperior opening of the cartilaginous cavity at tho bottom of the tongue, b

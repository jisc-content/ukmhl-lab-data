xlvi or twa at the utmost, is sufficient; after which they should dr}' and dress as speedily as possible. On coming out of the water, particularly after sea bath- ing,wherethe air is keen and sharp, although the heat of the water is more uniform than in rivers, should chilliness or trembling come on, a small quantity of weak brandy and water, to which a few drops of the compound spirit of lavender may be added, nill be found to be the best re- storative—using a gentle degree of exercise. Other means may be used, should these prove ins^ufficient; such as put- ting the patient to bed, and procuring warmth, Jkc. The pleasing glow of heat diffused over the body, after cold bathing, is a proof that it may be continued with benefit. THE HOT EATII. , By a hot bath is understood any degree of heat between 9.^° and 96° of Fahrenheit. It has a peculiar tendency to bring on a state of repose, to alleviate any local irritation, and thereby to induce sleep; it promotes personal clean-- liness ; is excellent to children aflFected with convulsions; in diseases of the skin ; restores suppressed perspiration ; relieves gouty, rheumatic, and hectic patients ; and com- plaints in the region of the kidnies and loins. It is also used in the puffy swellings in the legs, and obstructions peculiar to females, &c. It is, upon the whole, a safer re- medy than the cold bath, and more peculiarly applicable to very weak and irritable constitutions, whom the shock procured by the cold immersion would overpower, and who have not sufficient vigour of circulation for an ade- quate re-action. In all cases, where the local formation of matter is the solution of the general inflanmiatory symptoms, experience directs the use of warm relaxing applications, rather than those which, by exciting a general re-action, would increase the local complaint. This object is particularly to be con- sulted when the part affected is one that is essential to life.

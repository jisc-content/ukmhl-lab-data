273 SUPPRESSION OF THE MENSES. Any interruption to the menstrual flux, after it lias been once established, except when occurring from conception, is always to be considered as a suppression. Where it is proper to employ medicine to re- store the menses, any of the following forms may be given; viz.— Take Compound Tincture of Savin 1 ounce ; Tincture of Black Hellibore ^ ounce : Thirty drops, three times ^ay, in a wine glass* ful of pennyroyal water.^—(See Female Pills in the Appendix, p. 8). Also— Take the above Pill with Myrrh, and Compound Iron Pill, of each 1 drachm ; Subcarbonate of Soda 1 scruple; divide into l^ipills, and take two twice a day. on, Take Compound Tincture of Aloes 1 ounce ; Tincture of Castor 4 drachms ; Wine of Iron 1 ounce. Women should be cautious, in treating them- selves for this complaint, that they do not mis- take pregnancy for it. Nor can they be too careful, under an actual suppression of the menses, to avoid getting their feet wet, as well as all exposures to wet and cold. N 5

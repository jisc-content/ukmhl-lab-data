Another very important use of the warm bath is in that species of eruption termed Herpes,* (see p. 285), by re- laxing the skin, and rendering it more pervious, and ad- mirably preparing it for receiving the stimulant applica- tions, of tar ointment, mercurials, &c., that are intended to restore it to a healthy state.

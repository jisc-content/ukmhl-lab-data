291 All persons labouring under worms ought to discontinue the use of vegetable food^ particularly that of the raw description, as it increases the \'igour of the worms more than animal food. In tape-worm, the fern root, in powder, as prescribed by Madame NoufFer, in her celebrated remedy, has been efficaciously employed when other remedies have failed. The dose for an adult, of the male fern root, is from one to two drachms, fasting in the morning; after the e- cond dose, a purge, consisting of five grains of calomel and twenty-five grains of jalap is given. Spirit of turpentine, it appears, has recently been given with very good effect in tape-worm. The dose for a delicate female, will be an ounce; for a robust female or small man, one ounce and a . half 5 for a robust man, two ounces; taken early in the morning, in milk, when purging will be speedily produced by it, &c. Cowhage, made into an electuary with treacle or honey, is also given in tape-worm, and in that species of it which resembles the earth-worm. The dose is a table-spoonful night and morning; it should be taken before food, or immediately after- wards, but never on an empty stomach. After three or four doses, a purge of calomel and jalap, as here recommended, should be given. (See ; Electuaries, p. 331.) o2

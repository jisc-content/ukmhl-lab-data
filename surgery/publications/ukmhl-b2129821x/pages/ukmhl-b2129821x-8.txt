JV, PREFACE. In the Appendix,-wluch, like the Introduction, constitutes a valuable feature in the work, Domestic Pharmacy is laid down, in a simplified and agreeable form, embracing only such preparations as are easily at- tainable, and in more general requisition than others.â€”Tlie Key to the Domestic Medicine Chest is also arranged on the same plan: tjie virtues and doses of such articles being selected which are known fora experience to be those mostly called for by all who prescribe for them- selves. In presenting the reader with a list of Nostrums, that is, Quack Medicines, with the quantity, quality. Sec. of their ingredients, it may be superfluous to add, that this is not done, by any means, to recom- mend them either to private families or individuals, who can always be supplied, at one-fifth of the price, at the counter of the apothecaiy^pr thfe druggist with the genuine articles, and with less risk to their lives; for, it must be clear to every one possessing the least knowledge of medicine, that what might, at one stage of disease, prove serviceable, at another would do harm ; in fact, an indiscriminate continuance in its use might destroy the patient. Themotive, on the contrary, which in- duced the Author to exhibit, to the credulous and less experienced eye^ the nostrums in question,*is to convince them that the profession IS not, as supposed by many, ignorant of their component parts ; con- sequently with all their pretended and contradictory virtues; for many indeed there are, even at the present enlightened period, who imagine that advertised nostrums are secrets unknown to any one but their iiiventors, and, on this account alone, properties so extraordinary are ascribed to them that the unwary give them an exclusive pre- ference to the legitimate and approved prescription of the qualified physician; and this, it would seem, merely because the former are more destructive and expensive than a recipe from the latter, of a more simple and more efficacious nature, given without secrecy or re- reserve. Happily, however, for mankind, the clouds and mysteries of Charlatanism are fast dissipating before the irresistible rays of science, in defiance of every obstacle that hitherto has beea opposed to their progress.

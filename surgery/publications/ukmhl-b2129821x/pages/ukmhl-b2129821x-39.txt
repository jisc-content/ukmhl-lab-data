xxix moisten the intestines ; or, it may arise from mere debility, from palsy of the fibres, perhaps, or from a deficiency of the usual stimulus ; for instance, of the bile, or from too dry or slender a diet. The consequences of long-continued costiveness are, first, an affection of the alitnentary canal, and then of the whole body. The stomach becomes dis- eased, and does not digest the aliments properly ; the whole body is left destitute of its usual stimulus; the blood is corrupted, perhaps from the putrid matter contained in the intestines being resolved into it; the circulation through the intestines is impededâ€”hence frequent and irregular congestions, vaicus of the reins, piles, &c. "What is more, the intestines themselves, being overloaded, distended, and irritated by a heavy, acrid, and putrid load of aliment, or other matters, are excited to new and unusual contrac- tions, which, if they do not get the better of the obstruc- tion, bring on colic, iliac passion, inflammation, and gan- grene, fatal in a very short time. For other disorders of the alimentary canal, see Dyscnteiy, Tenesmus, Nausea and Vomiting, Iliac Passion, Cholera, Sec. Sec, under their respective heads, In the practical part of the work.

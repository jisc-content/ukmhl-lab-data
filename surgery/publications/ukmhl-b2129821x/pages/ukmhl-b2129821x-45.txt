XXXV SPECIFIC MORBIFIC DISEASES PREVENTED, ETC., Thus, then, with respect to those kinds of morbific mat- ter which do not invariably produce a specific disease : but there are others of a specific nature, some of which are generated spontaneously in the body, and which seem to arise from errors in diet, or other circumstances of ill- management with respect to the animal economy ; and hence it is sometimes possible, to a certain degree if not altogether, to prevent the bad consequences that usually result from them. For example, there are instances where returns of the gout have been prevented or retarded by strictly adhering to a milk diet.—Rheumatism has also been sometimes warded off by wearing a flannel shirt, or by an uninterrupted use of the cold bath.—Stone in the bladder, &c., may be retarded in its progress, and pre- vented from giving much pain by the internal use of soap and lime water, by soap lees taken in milk and veal broth, or by the use of aerated alkaline water; which may, perhaps, be considered as being both more safe and more eSicacious, and, at the same time, more pleasant than any of the other practices.—The scurvy may be prevented by warm clothing and perseverance in brisk exercise, by drinking wine or cider, and eating freely of such vegetable substances as can be obtained in those situations where this disease is most apt to show itself.—In constitutions where there is an hereditary dis- position to scrofula (king's evil), if early precaution be taken to strengthen the solids by cold bathing, nourishing diet, and the moderate use of wine, the constitution which gives rise to the disease will probably be prevented from producing any very bad effects. PHEVENTION of other KINDS OF MORBIFIC MATTER, ETC. There are other kinds of morbific matter, of the specific kind, received into the body by infection or contagion.—

XXlll These, however, are scarcely to be observed in a healthy person, but are evident enough in one that is feverish, especially when the fever is a hectici* Debility itself often renders the pulse quicker than usual; in consequence of the action of the right ventricle of the heart not being sufficient to empty itself, it is the sooner dilated again, and, of necessity, contracts the sooner. This is the reason why physicians are unable to judge of the strength of the circulation from the frequency of the pulse. In all fevers, however different from one another they may be, the pulse is found to be too quick, partly from de- bility, partly from the acrimony of the fluids, and partly from the blood being repelled from the surface of the body, and the accumulation of it in the larger vessels, where it acts as a stimulus. The pulse is seldom observed too slow, unless the mobility of the body be much diminished, as in decrepid old age, or from compression or diseases of the brain, &c. As long as the frequency of the pulse continues the same, its beats may be either fi\II, great, strong, and hard, or soft small, and weak. A full, great and strong pulse, takes place when the ventricle strongly and completely empties Itself; throwing out a great quantity of blood into the arteries, which fully distends them, and stimulates them to a stronger contraction. A pulse of this kind is common in strong, healthy men, and is seldom to be reckoned a symptom of disease. But should it be too strong, and strike the finger of the person who feels it violently and sharply, it is called a hard pulse, the hardness of which is produced by a sudden and violent contraction of the heart and arteries, which distends even the remote branches, as those of the wrist, too suddenly and smartly, and also ex- * Hectic fever is generally a symptom of some other complaint, such ai the green-sickness, king's evil, consumption, diseased viscera, &c. It is known by exacerbations at noon, but greater in the evening, witli slight remissions in the morning, after nocturnal sweats ; the urine de- posits a sediment (furfuraceo lateritious), accompanied with good ap- petite and moderate thirst.

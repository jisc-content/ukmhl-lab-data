The motions of ex- piration, peculiar to coughing, are made more rapidly and violently than usual; and, after several convulsive respirations, a sudden and full inspiration succeeds, in which, the peculiar sound, known by the name of " hoop," is emit- ted. After this sonorous inspiration has taken place, the convulsive coughing is again re- newed, and continues in the same manner as before, until a quantity of mucus is thrown up from the lungs, or the contents of the stomach evacuated by vomiting, which generally terminates the fit; the patient is then enabled to resume the amusements he was engaged in before it came on, and often expresses a desire for food. It is distinguished from every other disease by the convulsive cough, followed by the sonorous inspirati(m above described ^ and, by terminating in vomiting or expectoration. The most favourable symptoms in hooping cough are, when the expectoration or discharge from the lungs is moderate, the fit neither fre- quent nor violent, the respiration during the in- tervals free, the appetite good, no fever, mode- rate bleeding from the nose, &c.

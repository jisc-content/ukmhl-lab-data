The supertartrate of potass (cream of tartar or crystals of tartar) is a very powerful remedy, and is administered in doses of two or three drachms every hour, till copious evacuations are produced, either by urine or stool; using, at the same time, tepid diluent drinks plentifully. This medicine should be taken every or every other morning, according to the strength of the patient j and as the thirst is a very distressing sjTuptom in this disease, the patient should be allowed to talie aÂ« muc^i wa^r, or jnM mucilaginous liquids,

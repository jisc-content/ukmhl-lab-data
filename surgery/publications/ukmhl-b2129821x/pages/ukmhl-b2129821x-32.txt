xxu have passed whole days, and even months, in almost unin- terrupted sleep.—(See Sleep, p.xix). OF THE PULSE. ^ Medically speaking, the beating of the artery at the wrist is termed the pulse. It depends upon the impulse given to the blood by the heart; hence physicians feel the pulse to ascertain the quickness or slowness of the circu- lation, which, indeed, is very various, as well with regard to frequency as to the strength and equality of its strokes and intervals. Its usual standard in a healthy adult is about 70 beats or pulsations in a minute. In a foetus or child in the womb, it is, perhaps, more than double this amount; and in an infant a few weeks old, hardly less than 120. As we grow up this quickness diminishes; so that in extreme old age it sometimes does not exceed 50, or is even slower. This rule, however, is not without ex- ceptions ; for many, especially those of an irritable habit, have the pulse much quicker; while others, in the vigor of their age, have their pulse remarkably slow. In women it is usually somewhat quicker than in men. It may also be rendered quicker, both in a healthy and in a diseased state of the body, by the application of various kinds of sti- muli. Exercise, more especially, by accelerating the re- turn of the blood through the veins, increases the quick- ness of the pulse in a surprising degree. Various kinds of irritations affecting the nervous system—as intense think- ing, passions of the mind, pain, beat, stimulating medicines, wine, spices, &c., have all the same effect; as well as the acrimony of the blood itself, which is thought to quicken the pulse. On first awaking in the morning, the pulse is slow, but gradually becomes quicker, owing to the variety of irritatuig matters applied to the body. Its quickness is increased after taking food, especially of the animal kind, or such as is hot or highly seasoned. Towards the evening a slight fever comes on, for which rest and sleep are the remedies.

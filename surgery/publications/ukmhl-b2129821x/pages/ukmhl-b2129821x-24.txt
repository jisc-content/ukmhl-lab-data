xiv not see distinctly, unless the object be very near them. This disease arises from too great a refraction of the rays of light, by reason of their being too soon collected into a focus by the crystalline lens, and diverging again upon the retina,* by which means they make an indistinct picture upon it. The most common cause is too great a convexity of tlie eye or some of its humours—as too prominent a cornea, &c. It is a disorder common to young people, which is sometimes removed when they grow older. As soon as the first approaches of short-sightedness are observed, it is supposed it may be obviated by the person's accustoming himself to view remote objects, and keeping his eyes off very small and near ones ; as, on the contrarj', it may be brought on bj' the opposite custom ; because tlie eye accommodates itself somewhat to the distances of those objects which it is accustomed to view. But a concave glass, which causes the rays of light to diverge more than they naturally would before falling upon the cornea, is the most simple and certain remedy. Long-sighted people are those who cannot see an object distinctly, unless it be at a considerable distance from them. This arises from a cause opposite to the former ; namely, the eye being too flat, so that there is no room for refracting the rays, and bringing them into a focus. This defect is most common in old people, and is remedied by the use of convex glasses. Nyctnlopis are those who see better with a very weak than with a strong light. It is a defect very seldom met with in the human race, though every person is sensible of it who has been long kept in the dark, and is then sud- denly brought into the light. The disease arises from too great a sensibility of the retina, and the pupil of the eye being too open. The sight is subject to many grievous disasters.

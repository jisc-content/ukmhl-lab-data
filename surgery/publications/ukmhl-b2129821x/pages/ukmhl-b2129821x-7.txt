PREFACE, A Manual of Domestic Medicine, if an inference may be drawn from the pre-existing number of productions of a similar nature, is less wanted at the present moment than any other work. Tliose already extant are certainly, with much plausibility, ostensibly addressed to the heads of families, &c,, to direct them in tlie treatment of disease; but in reality, and this is well known, many of them are better calcu- lated to effect harm than good. By attempts at simplification, with the intention of making themselves intelligible to all classes of society, the style of them is rendered equally quaint and non-medical; nor in the illustration of disease are they less unhappy in the selection and order of their materials, either in a nosological or curative point of view. A Book that treats of diseases, whether intended for general or domestic purposes, ought, doubtless, to be established upon practical medical principles ; and any aberration from the established practice, is not only the height of presumption and empiricism, but a most absurd and unequivocal incongruity, irreconcilable with the impor- tance, as well as with the benefit that must naturally be anticipated from such an enterprise. In the arrangement of the following materials, particular regard has been paid to render them as clear and explicit as the nature of the different subjects would permit; steering the middle course be- tween brevity and prolixity, and without running either into the extremes of medical abstruseness, or descending to the tameness of a too familiar phraseology. On the other hand, if a few important diseases have been inten- tionally fimitted, such, for instance, as Gutta Serena or Anjaurosis, a disease, in fact, depending upon a paralysis of the optic nerves ; and others, again, the consequence of morbid structure or malorganisation of parts, (Sec, the reason, it is hoped, is sufficiently obvious to require no explanation here ; for, where the Faculty itself is baffled, certainly little success could be looked for in any other quarter. To supply, however, these omissions, a variety of important, interesting, and in- structive subjects have been introduced, that are not to be met witU in any other work of the kind.

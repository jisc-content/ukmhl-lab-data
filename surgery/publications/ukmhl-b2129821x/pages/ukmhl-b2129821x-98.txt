Mulled port wine, or pure port, or diluted brandy should be frequently administered where the symptoms run high 5 and, as the disease ad- vances, the patient's strength must be supported by diluted wine, with sago, arrow-root, tapioca, &c. &c.; for ordinary drink, wine whey, or negus acidulated with oranges and lemons. The patient's chamber should be kept cool, the floor often sprinkled with vinegar, air freely admitted, and fumigated by casting powdered nitre over a chafing-dish containing live coals; all sources of putrid effluvia should be removed, the stools re- gularly taken away, and the patient's linen fre- quently changed. A change of air is often ne- cessary after the attack.

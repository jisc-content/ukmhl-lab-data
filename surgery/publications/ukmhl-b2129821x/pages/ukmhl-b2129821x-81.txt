19 PHRENSY, OR INFLAMMATION OF THE BRAIN, ETC. Inflammation of the brain is characterised by strong fever, severe pain in the head, redness of the face and eyes, intolerance of light and sound, watchfuhiess and violent delirium. The causes which give rise to phrensy, or in- flammation of the brain, are those which directly stimulate the membranes or substance of the brain, or which increase the flow of blood in its vessels: for exampleâ€”violent fits of passion; in- tense study; excessive venery; severe exercise; external violence of any kind, such as blows on the head, concussions, fissure or fracture of the skull; immoderate use of vinous and spiritous liquors; want of sleep; a long continued exposure to the heat of the sun; and the suppression of long-accustomed evacuations, as the piles, the menses, issues drying up; it is also preceded by acute fever, or some inflammatory complaint, &c. &c. The treatment of this disease is the same with that of inflammations generally; but in phrensy, or inflammation of the brain, the most powerful remedies are to be immediately employed. Large and repeated blood-letting is especially necessary, until fainting ensues, leeches to the temples, drastic purges, bathing the feet, shaving the head.

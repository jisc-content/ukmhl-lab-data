xxxiv the fluids have been exhausted, the prevention of further waste must be attempted by the nse of strengthening stomachics, nourishing diet, and abstaining from mental or bodily fatigue.—(See Atrophy, &c., p. 196). VITIATED FLUIDS. These are to be considered as tainted either with the different kinds of general acrimony, or as betraying signs of some of the species of morbific matter which give rise to particular diseases, such as the stone, scurvy, &c. ACIDITY OF INFANTS, ETC. During the state of infancy, there may sometimes be observed a remarlcable acidity, which not only manifests itself in the first passages, but also seems to contaminate the general mass of fluids. As this, however, originates from weak bowels, our views, when we mean to prevent the ill consequences, must be chiefly directed to strengthen the digestive organs, as on their soundness depends the formation of chyle ; hence small doses of rhubarb and the preparations of steel (either the natural water impreg- nated with the mineral or the muriate of ammonia and of iron, in doses of a few grains, according to the age of the child) are to be administered; and tlie diet is to be so re- gulated as not to add to tliis acid tendency; brisk exercise is also to be enjoined, with frictions on the stomach, belly, and lower extremities. When the fluids tend to the putrescent state—which shows itself by fetid breath, sponginess and bleeding of the gums, a bloated look, and livid cast—the diet should prin- cipally consist of fresh vegetables and ripe fruits ; wine in moderation, due exercise, and stiengthening bitters.—(See Dyspepsy, p. 126). Where acrimony shows itself by itch- ing eruptions, uncommon thirst, and flushing heats, no- thing will be more beneficial than the sulphureous and moff'at waters, using, at the same time, a course of diet that shall be neither acrid nor heating.

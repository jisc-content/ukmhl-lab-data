Tlie vapour bath forms a valuable remedy in a variety of cases. In most of the hot natural waters on the conti^ nent, the vapour bath forms a regular part of the bathing apparatus, and is there highly valued. In no country, however, is this application carried to so high an extent as in Russia, where it forms the principal and almost daily luxury of all the people, in every rank, and it is employed as a sovereign remedy for a great variety of complaints. The Hon. Mr. Basil Cochrane, some short time back, pub- lished a treatise on the vapour bath, from which it appears be has brought the apparatus to such perfection, that he can apply it to all degrees of temperature, partially or generally, by shower or by steam, with a great force or a small one, according to the particular circumstances under which pa- tients are so variously placed who require such assistance.* Connected with this article is the air pump vapour bath, or machine, to which the inventor has given this name. This apparatus has been found efficacious in removing pa- roxysms of the gout, and preventing their recurrence, in acute and chronic rheumatism, palsy, diseases of the skin, ulcers, lumbago, sciatica, &c. It has also been proposed in chilblains, leprosy, yaws, cramps, female obstructions, and dropsy, with every probability of success. MEDICATED BATHS.

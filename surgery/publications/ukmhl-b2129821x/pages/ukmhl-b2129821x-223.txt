161 A late writer* states, that equal portions of linseed oil and flour of sulphur made into a mixture, and a tea-spoonful given three or four times a day, or less frequently, according to the age of the subject, has produced beneficial effects in mitigating the violence of this disease. "Some people," he observes, " consider it the sovereign remedy in this distressing complaint." As the body is usually very costive in hooping cough, gentle laxatives will be necessary to re- move it, such as senna tea, manna, &c. Stoned prunes, roasted apples, &c., which children readily grasp at, may also be given, to remove or prevent this symptom. Frequent bathing of the feet in warm water is likewse recommended. Change of air has invariably been found serviceable in this disease. Flannel next the patient's skin should also be worn; and the greatest attention ought to be paid to young children, by cautiously watching them when the cough comes on, to put them immediately in the erect position, bending them a little forward, to guard against suffocation. They should also, when placed in bed, have their head and shoulders raised. Their diet should be light, and of an easily digestable nature. ^* Dr. Waterhouse, {Boston, America.)

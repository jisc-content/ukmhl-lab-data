163 Hence palpitation arises from any affection of the mind, and in hysterical women. It may also arise from an affection of the stomach, ocr casioned by v/orms, surfeit, wind, or from various acrid substances in contact with the inner coat of this organ. It also, not unfrequently, accom- panies the gout, when repelled or thrown froni the extremities towards the trunk of the body, or even when a fit is coming on. Sometimes it arises from general weakness of the solids, as well as from local causes : also, from any difficulty in breathing; in short, from a combination of niany of the before-mentioned causes, or from some of them producing others. The treatment of this disease consists in re- moving the exciting cause as soon as it is ascertained. If it arise from fulness of habit, -bleeding, purgatives, rest, and spare diet; if from weaknessâ€”bark, bitters, preparations of motions are produced by the customary stimuli. It is de- pendent on certain habits of body ; sometimes it is heredi- tary. Women have a greater share of mobility than men; infants have a great deal, often too much of it; youth less tiban infancy ; and old age commonly too little. A lazy, sedentary life, full diet, fulness of the blood, suppression of customary evacuations, &c. &c., produce too great mobility. Torpor is the opposite to too great mobility; as the op< posite to too great debility is rigour.

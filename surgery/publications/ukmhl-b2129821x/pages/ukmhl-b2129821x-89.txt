27 INFLAMMATORY SORE THROAT. The causes which generally give rise to this complaint are, exposure to cold, either from changes in the weather, from being placed in a partial current of air, wearing damp linen, sitting in wet rooms, or getting wet in the feet, coming out of a heated or crowded room suddenly into the open and cool airâ€”all of which may give a sudden check to perspiration. It may also be occasioned by violent exertions of the voice,, blowing wind instruments, acrid substances irri- tating the fauces, (cavity behind the tongue), and by the sudden suppression of any accustomed evacuations. It differs from the malignant or putrid sore throat by not being contagious, and by princi- pally attacking the youthful and those of a full and plethoric habit, and is chiefly confined to cold climates, occurring usually in spring and autumn; whereas the malignant sore throat is contagious, and chiefly attacks those of a weak irritable habit, and is most prevalent in warm climates. Many people are so strongly predisposed to this complaint, as to be attacked with it from any considerable application of cold beyond what they are habitually accustomed to. c 2

230 Where children, with this disease, can be per- suaded to take bark, a few grains of the extract may be given mixed up in port wine. And to assist the effect of the above remedies, a gently emetic may be occasionally given, particularly in those cases where the appetite and digestion are considerably impaired. The bowels are to be kept open with some gentle laxative. In removing obstructions of the abdominal viscera in children, and to restore the health, by soliciting the return of the secretions, Sir A. Cooper, Bart,, strenuously recommends the fol- lowing mixture; viz. â€” Take Tincture of Peruvian Bark, and Tincture of Rhubarb, of each 1 ouneei Oxymuriate of Quicksilver 1 grain: Mix, and let a tea-spoonful be given twice or three times a day. When there is rickets with mesenteric ob- struction, the above will be found to produce a very beneficial effect j with occasional doses of from three to five grains of the compound pow- der of chalk with opium. Should the rickets have proceeded from a ve- nereal taint, tonics and mercury may be com- bined ; if from worms or difficult teething, the means advised imder those heads may be adopted.

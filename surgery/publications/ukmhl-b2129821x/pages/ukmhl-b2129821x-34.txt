XXIV cites them "to sudden and violent contractions. A hard pulse, therefore, denotes too great an action of the heart and arteries ; and it may arise from varions causes. A small, weak and soft pulse, is generally owing to causes opposite to the former; audit indicates a contrary state of the circulation and nervous system. It frequently re- quires stimulants; but does not generally require blood- letting, nor can it easily bear it. The pulse is said to intermit, when the stroke does not return after the usual interval, and, perhaps, not till after twice, thrice or four times the usual space. This kind of pulse appears to be almost natural and constant in some animals, and is common to some men, even in the most per- fect health ; and should these be seized with a fever, the pulse sometimes becomes regular; nor can the disease bÂ» reniov- ed before the intermission has returned. Moreover, there are many people in whom, though their pulse beat equally while in health, the slightest illness makes it intermit; and in others, such as hypochondriac and hysteric people, who liave a great deal of mobility in their constitution, the in- termission of the pulse is felt without applying the finger to the artery, merely by the uneasiness which they feel in their breasts daring those intervals in which the pulse is deficient. An intermitting pulse occurs in diseases of the breast, especially when water is collected within it; and also at the termination of all diseases, particularly of fevers, when the strength is neajly exhausted, and on the ap- proach of death, of which it is generally the forerunner. There are many other variations of pulse euinnerated by physicians, most of which, however, are cither uncertain ; or, from not being confirmed by experience, arc not to be depended on.

lU when taken away, removes it; and, when changed, changes it. There are also remote causes, which physicians have been accustomed to divide into the predisponent and excit- ing ones. The former are those which only render the body fit for a disease, or which put it into such a state that it will readily receive one. The predisponent cause is always inherent in the body itself; though, perhaps, it originally came frojn without; for instance, heat or cold, a very spare diet, and many other circumstances, may operate as predisposing causes, inducing plethora, inanition, or the like. But the exciting cause may either come from within or without. By a combination of the predisposing and exciting causes, arises the proximate cause, which neither of the two taken singly, is often able to produce. A body predisposed to dis- ease, therefore, has already declined somewhat from a state of perfect health, although none of its functions are arrested in such a manner that the person may be said to be diseased. The predisponent cause, nevertheless, by con- tinuing long, may arrive at such a length, that it alone, with- out the interference of the exciting cause, may produce a real disease. The exciting cause also, though it should not be able to bring on disease, yet if it continue long, will imme- diately gradually destroy the strongest constitution j and render it liable to various disorders ; because it either pro- duces a predisponent cause, or is converted into it, so that the same thing may sometimes be an exciting cause, some- times a predisponent one, or rather a cause of predisposi- tion ; of which the inclemencies of the weather, sloth, luxury, &c., are examples. HEREDITARY DISEASES. Under every consideration, diseases seem to have their origin from the very constitution of the animal machine ; hence many disorders are common to every one when a proper exciting cause occurs, though some people are much fioore liable to certain diseases than others.

69 OF INTERMITTENT FEVERS, OR AGUES. These are divided into the quotidian, or daily; the tertian, or third day; the quartan, or fourth day agues, implying the distance of time observed between the periods of their return. There are other varieties and forms of this disease; but here we shall only notice agues, in the ordinary mode of appearance. When agues arise in the spring of the yearj they are called vernal; in autum, autumnal agues. They, often prove of obstinate cure and duration in warm climates; but more particularly where drop- sical swellings exist, and enlargement of the liver and spleen. They are more prevalent in marshy countries, and are said to arise in consequence of marsh vapour, the effluvia arising from stagnant water or marshy ground, when acted upon by the heat of the sun, &c. Poor watery living, excessive fatigue, weakness, exposure to cold and moisture, damp atmospheres, lying in damp rooms or beds, suppression of some long-accustomed evacuation; the recession, or falling in, of eruptions, &c., are also among the exciting causes of ague. Each paroxysm of this type of fever is divided into three different stages, called the cold, the hot, and sweating stages 3 and these regularly succeed each other.

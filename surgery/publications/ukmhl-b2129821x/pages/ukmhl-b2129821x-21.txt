xi tongue. When this is wounded, or removed, or diseased, then the taste, becoming too acute, is painful, &c. Tlie sense of taste may be impaired, like that of any other external sense, from various diseases of the brain and nerves ; of which, however, there are but few in* stances. In some people it is more bhmted, as well as more acute, than in others ; and where the sense of taste is deficient, that of smelling is also so. It is sometimes deficient, owing to tlie want of saliva; for a dry tongue cannot perceive any taste : hence this sense is very dull in many diseases, especially in fevers, &c. It is also frequently depraved ; as when, for instance, we have a perception of taste without the application of any thing to the tongue ; or, when any thing is applied to it, we feel a taste different from wbat it ought to be. This happens, for the most part, from a vitiated condition of the saliva, which is itself tasted in the mouth. Independent of this, the taste may be vitiated from other causes, &c. In almost every disease, especially in fevers, physicians inquire into the state of the tongue, and not without the greatest reason ; as from this they can judge of the state of the stomach, of the thirst, or rather the occasion the patient has for drink, when, on account of delirium or stupor, he neither feels his thirst, nor is able to call for drink. And, lastly, from an inspection of the tongue, physicians endeavour to form some judgment concerning the nature, increase, and remission of the fever, &c. SMELL. The seat of this sense is in that very soft and delicate membrane, filled with nerves and blood-vessels, which covers the internal parts of the nose, and (he various sinuses and cavities proceeding from thence. As, by our taste, we are enabled to judge of the soluble parts of bodies, so, by our sense of smelling, we can detect those very volatile and subtle parts which fly into the air; and, like the organ of taste, that of smell is kept moist, that its

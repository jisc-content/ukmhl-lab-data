10 adult, an hour or two before bed-time, and in a similar proportion to those of a younger age. Instead of the tincture of opium, children at the breast may take a small quantity of the syrup of poppies. But if, notwithstanding the preceding means, the tumour should show an evident tendency to suppurate, its progress must be hastened by .the application of bread and milk or linseed meal poultices. Before, however, the poultice be applied, the part affected should be well fomented with flannels wrung out of a warm de- coction or infusion of emollient herbsâ€”such as camomile flowers, marshmallows, poppy heads, &c.; or, when these cannot readily be procured, the part may be fomented with warm milk and water, as hot as it can be borne, or eyen with warm water alone. When the suppuration is complete, and the tumour is soft to the touch, and the matter lies near the surface, it may be opened with a lancet at its most depending part, and the matter thus suffered to escape; observing to press the whole of it out. The wound afterwards may be dressed with dry lint, and a pledget spread with basilicon laid over all, when pus will form, and granulations of new flesh will fill up the cavity in the wound.

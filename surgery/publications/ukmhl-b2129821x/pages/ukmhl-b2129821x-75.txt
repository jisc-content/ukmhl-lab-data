This is the second species of inflammation, and implies an inflammatory affection con- fined principally to the skin, when seated out- wardly, and to the mucous membrane when in- ternally, with hardly any evident swelling; being of a mixed red colour, readily disappearing upon pressure, but quickly returning again; the redness, not being regularly circumscribed, but spreading unequally, with a pain like to that of burning, which gives rise to a number of small blisters (which in unfavourable cases degenerate into obstinate ulcers); terminating usually by the fall- ing off of the scarf skin, and sometimes in gan- grene, but never in suppuration, unless combined with inflammation of the preceding species. Tlie treatment of this kind of inflammation is also different from the former. It more parti- cularly attacks those advanced in years, of a weak, irritable, and spare habit.

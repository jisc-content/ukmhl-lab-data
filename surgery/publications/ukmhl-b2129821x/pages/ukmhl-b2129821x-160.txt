98 VOMITING OF BLOOD. This is a discharge of dark-coloured grumous blood from the stomach, in greater or less quantity, mixed with alimentary matter; pre- ceded by a sense of weight and dull pain or anxiety in the region of the stomach. The causes giving rise to 'it are a plethoric habit, suppression of evacuations, blows, bruises, &c. It seldom proves fatal from the loss of blood, but often occasions considerable weak- ness. It is also a frequent occurrence of some other disease; and the success of the treatment here will depend on the probability of that disease being cured. When vomiting of blood is accompanied with symptoms which indicate an inflammatory dispo- sition, general bleeding, spare diet, and sedative remedies, should be resorted to. If it depend on other causes, tonic and astringent remedies, with sulphuric acid and opium; for instanceâ€” Take Infusion of Roses 13 drachms ; Diluted Sulphuric Acid 10 drops ; Syrup of Roses 1 drachm ; Tincture of Opium 10 drops : Make a draught, to be taken every two hours.

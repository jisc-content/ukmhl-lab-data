122 OR, Take bruised Mastard-seed ; and Horse-radish Root, of each 4 ounces ; Bruised Orange Peel 1 ounce; Water 4 pints: boiled down slowly to one pint; strain the liquor off, and let the patient take a wine glass full three times a dayj adding to it occasionally, thirty drops of the ammoniated tincture of vale- rian. Besides applying stimulants, tonic medicines, such as are recommended in indigestion, may be used internally, when palsy is known to arise from any debilitating cause. The palsy, or loss of nervous power in parti - cular limbsj which may be a consequence of that painftil and obstinate colic caused by poison of lead, is found to be peculiarly relieved by using the Bath waters, more especially when applied externally, either generally or on the part .effected. The diet in palsy should be light, nutritive, and of a warm, aromatic nature. Exercise, should the patient be able to walk, as much as the patient's strength will bear; and, if deprived of the use of his limbs, he may be carried abroad in a carriage, or on horseback. Rubbing the parts with strong stimulants should be frequently used.

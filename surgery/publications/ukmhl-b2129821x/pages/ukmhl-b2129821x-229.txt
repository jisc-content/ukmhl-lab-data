167 A very strong infusion of roasted coffee has been found to give ease in a fit of asthma. Sir John Pringle * says it is the best abater of the periodic asthma he has seen. The coffee ought to ;be of the best Moka, newly burnt, and made very strong immediately after grinding *t. He commonly ordered an ounce for one cup, which is to be repeated fresh after the interval of a quarter or ,half an hour—to be taken without milk or sugar. Dr. Percival states, that he has frequently directed coffee in asthma with great success. Warm water, inhaled from the spout of a tea- ' pot, has afforded relief in severe fits of this com- plaint : also an infusion of camomile flowers. With the addition of a little aether, may be used, for the same purpose, and probably with better effect. In spasmodic asthma, smoking tobacco has proved of service. Latterly the roots of stramonium or thorn-apple, have been much em- • Coffee, as a medicine in asthma, in general, is men- tioned by Masgrave in bis Treatise de Asthritide Ammala ; but he first heard of it from a physician in Litchfield, who had been informed by the old people of that place, that Sir iohn Floyer, during the latter part of his life, kept free from, or at least lived easy under, his asthma, from th« ase of very strong coffee. This discovery he made after the pablication of bis book on this di»ease.

X ITCHING. This is an uneasy sensation, accompanied with a desire to scratch the part affected ; it is often very troublesome, although it seems to be more closely allied to pleasure than pain; as the latter proceeds from too great an irritation, either chemical or mechanical; the former from a slight one. Tilillation, or friction, for instance, from the skin being in contact with a woollen shirt, to a person unaccustomed to it, and of a delicate constitution, excites itching, as also do many acrid fossils, vegetables, and animals.

This sense accompanies a variety of diseases, and is very rarely depraved, unless, perhaps, in tlie case of de-; lirium, where all the functions of the brain are disturbed in a surprising manner.

Nothing can be tasted which is not capable of being dissolved by the saliva. Neither is it sufficient for a body to be soluble that it may be tasted; it must have some sahne or acrid property, in or- der to stimulate the nervous subsfance of the tongue; hence, whatever has less salt in it than the saliva, is to- tally insipid. The taste is rarely found to be too acute, unless through some fault in the epidermig covering the

9 321 Injection of Starch zcith Opium. — Starch, from one drachm to two; cold water, 2 ounces; warm water, 4 to 6 ounces; opium 2 grains to 4. Rub the powdered opium and starch together till they are minutely divided; then add, gradually, the cold water, and lastly the hot water. A common Injection.—Baxley water, from 1 pint to 2; olive oil, 2 ounces; Epsom salts, 1 ounce: mix them for use:—or, to the barley water add from 2 to 3 ounces of olive oil. The first is \rell calculated for emptying the lower bowels, without stimulating them too forcibly. When the decoction of barley is used for injections, it should be much thinner than as directed for a demul- cent drink, which, if diluted with an equal portion of boiling water, answers very well. Injection of the Gall Nut.—Powdered galls, 1 ounce; distilled water, pint: boil to a pint, and strain., This injection, administered t^vo or three times a day, will be found to afford considerable relief, where there exists a tendency to a frequent falling down of the fun- dament ; and it is also often very proper in the bleeding piles; and, in some cases, two or three grains of opium will give increased effect to this injection. Injection of Castor Qil.—Castor oil and honey, of eacli, 1 ounce; infusion of linseed, 10 ounces : rub the castor oil with the honey until they become intimately blended, and add the linseed infusion gradually. When an injection is intended to act quickly on the lower bowels, this will be found, in general, safe and effectual. p 5

196 ATROPHY. By atrophy is meant a gradual emaclatlou and decay of the whole body, unattended either with a difficulty of breathing, a cough, or any evident fever at first, but usually accompanied with loss of appetite, impaired digestion, depression of spirits, and general languor.. From whatever cause it may arise, it is usually very difficult to cure, and not unfrequently terminates in dropsy. Those causes which most commonly give rise to it, are poor diet, unwholesome air, scrofulous disposition, debility and excesses of every kind, continuing to give suck too long, free use of spi- rituous liquors, uneasiness of mind, worms, &c., although it not unfrequently comes on without any evident cause. The beginning of the disease is marked by luggishness, lassitude on the slightest exertion, depravity and loss of appetite; wasting of the flesh; paleness of the countenance, Avith bloating; swelling and prominence of the belly; puffy swelling of the feet; bowels irregular and cos- tive ; change of colour and smell of the faeces; and foetid breath. The continuance of these symptoms are followed by alternate flushing and paleness of the countenance; the skin becomes hot and dry; quick and feeble pulse 5 thirst,

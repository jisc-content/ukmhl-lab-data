Xll ifeQAation may be thfe more exqaisite, partly by its proper mucus and partly by the tears which descend from the eyes. Some kinds of odours greatly affect the nervous system, and produce the most surprising effects. Some gratefully excite it, and immediately recruit the spirits, when almost sinking, while others produce fainting, and sometimes death itself. The sense of smelling is sometimes too acute, either from disease of the organ, which happens more rarely, or from the too great sensibility of the nervous system in ge- neral. It is more frequently, however, too dull, either in consequence of diseases of the brain and nerves, as from some violence done to the head, or from some internal cause; or it may proceed from a dryness of the organ it- self, either on account of the customary humours being suppressed, or turned anotiicr way, or from the membranes being oppressed with too great a quantity of mucus, or tears, &c, HEARING. This sense is more frequently impaired than almost any of the rest, from the delicacy of its structure. It frequently becomes too acute, either from the general habit of the body being too irritable, such as happens in hysterical or lying-in women, or from too great sensibility of the braiti itself, which is not unfrcqucutly remarked in fevers, as well as in inflammation of the brain, &c., or it may proceed from a disease of the ear itself, as when it is affected with inflammation, pain, or too great a degree of tension. It may be rendered dull, or it may be altogether destroyed, so that the person shall become totally deaf, from the same causes acting with different degrees of force. This hap- pens, especially, from the want of the external ear; or from the auditory passage being stopped up with mucus, wax, or other matters ; or from the sides of the canal growing together, as sometimes happeus after suppuration

This termination however of inflammation is con- fined to glandular parts, and is most frequently met with in the breasts of females. SYMPTOMS DENOTING THE TERMINATION OF INFLAMMATION IN SUPPURATION. When the patient is seized with repeated shiverings—when the fever and inflammatory appearance cease suddenly without any percep- tible reason—when, instead of acute pain, a heavy and dull uneasiness is felt in the afl^ected part—when the most elevated part of the tumour appears soft and white, while the other part of it has its redness increased, and when a fluctua- tion can be felt under the finger on pressure, we may infer that a termination in suppuration has ensued.

xvi also be occasioned by disease, such as palsy, spasms, rigi- dity, &c., of the muscles which manage the eye; by epi- lepsy, water on the brain, and other diseases of the head. It is a remarkable physiological fact, that if the optic nerve did not enter the retina in an oblique direction, but passed directly through its centre, we should all either have squinted or seen double. VERTIGO, OR SWIMMING IN THE HEAD. The sensation known by the above names has been re- ferred by physicians to the sense of vision, though it would rather seem to belong to that of feeling, or of con- sciousness ; for in many instances the disorder is not re- moved either in the dark or by shutting the eyelids. The vertigo takes place when external objects, really at rest, seem to reel, whirl round, to tumble, or to move in any manner of way. If the disorder be very violent, the per- son is neither able to see, on account of dimness of sight, nor can he stand, as the power fails which ought to govern the limbs. An inclination to vomit usually accompanies swimming of the head, and the one generally produces the other. This disorder is observed to be both the symptom and forerunner of some dangerous disease, such as apo- plexy, epilepsy, hysteria; discharges of blood from the nose and other parts ; suppression of the menses; ple- thora, fever ; injuries done to the head ; sudden loss of blood; various motions of the head and of the whole body; and not unfrequently by affections of the mind itself. Although, for the most part, vertigo is a symptom con- comitant on other disorders, it is sometimes a primary disease, returning at intervals, increasing gradually, and equally impeding and destroying the functions of both body and mind.

lii il ia of no sei vice whatever. It is recommended in torpor of the sanguiferous system ; in torpor of the absorbent ves- sels ; in palsy ; green sickness ; in paralysis of the optic nerve (gutta serena); a tendency to fainting; general de- bility ; certain spasms affecting particular parts, e.g. St. Yitns' Dance ; stiff joints, &c. In all these it is most effi- cacious, but it often fails when the disease is of long stand- ing. It succeeds most frequently in St. Vitus' dance, and is applied in this case either by drawing large sparks from the part affected, or by making sparks pass from one part to another ; and the quantity taken or given ought to be varied according to the disease. In palsy, electricians often draw short vivid sparks three or four inches long. This, in the generality of cases, does harm; it ought to be moderately applied; small sparks should be taken, and frequently repeated, from a given spot; viz. a pretty strong electric burst, not very vivid, so as to produce a considerable degree of excite- ment, or make small shocks pass from one part te another. Chlorosis (green sickness), which had for a time resisted sleel, has had the menstrual flow appear while rather strong shocks were passing from the pubes to the spine; but many cases of the same complaint have cot been in the least benefited. Paralysis has often been caused by it. Wherever there ia a tendency to apoplexy, great cau- tion should be observed in the application of electricity ; and ia no cases should it be applied to the head. A true apoplexy has been produced by it.

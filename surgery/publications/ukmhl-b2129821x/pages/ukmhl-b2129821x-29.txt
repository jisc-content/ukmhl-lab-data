xix called spasm. Spasm, therefore, is a violent, constant, and preternatural contraction of the muscular fibres ; but a convulsion is an unusual and violent contraction, alter- nated with relaxation. People are rendered liable to spasm by too sensible a habit of body or too great mobility ; and hence it is a dis- ease common in women, in infants, and in weak, luxurious, lazy, and plethoric people. It is brought on those already predisposed to it, by any kind of stimulus applied to the brain, or to any nerve, muscle, or nervous part connected with it; of which we have examples in the teething of children ; worms lodged in the intestines, and irritating them ; any acrid matter infecting the blood, or much af- fecting the stomach and intestines; the irritation of any nerve, or of the brain itself; from a hard tumour of bone ; swelling ; too great fulness of the vessels ; pain ; vehe- ment aflFections of the mind ; sudden evacuations, or poison admitted into the body. Frequently, however, the ma- lady takes its origin from slight causes, little known, and not easily observed. It is both the cause and effect, and frequently constitutes the greatest part of many diseases. (See Tetanus or Cramp, p. 131.) SLEEP. The use of sleep is sufficiently obvious from the effects it produces. It restores both the powers of the mind and body when exhausted by exercise, giving vigour to the one and restoring the other to its accustomed alacrity. By means of sleep the muscles are again rendered active and moveable, after they have become wearied, rigid, painful, and trembling from hard labour and severe exercise. It moderates the quickness of the pulse, which usually in- creases at night, and brings it back to its morning stand- ard. It seems also to assist the digestion of the alimeut; it diminishes both secretions and excretions, and renders tlie fluids thicker than otherwise they would be, particularly in a body endowed with much sensibility or mobility.

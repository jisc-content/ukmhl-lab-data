xlii tlieni; aud are eitlier natural or artyicial. The natural hot baths are formed of the water of hot springs, of which there are many in difi'erent parts of the world ; especially in those countries where tliere are, or evidently have been, volcanoes. The artificial hot baths consist of water, either fresh or salt, in its natural degree of heat; or they may be made cold by art—as by a mixture of nitre and sal ammoniac, &c. The chief hot baths in our country, are those of Bath, Buxton, and Matlock; which latter, however, are rather -warm or tepid, than hot. The use of these baths is found to be beneficial in diseases of the head—as palsies, «&c.; in diseases of the skin—as leprosies, &c.; obstructions and constipations of the bowels; the scurvy, and in many dis- eases of women and children. DIRECTIONS FOR THE USE OF THE COLD BATH, &c. ' " Cold bathing has this good alone, It spurs old John to hug old Joan, And of the matrimonial two makes one." The cold bath, though popularly esteemed one of the most innocent remedies yet discovered, is not, however, to be adopted indiscriminately. On the contrary, it is liable to do considerable mischief in all cases of diseased viscera, and is not, in any case, proper to be used during the existence of costiveness, which should preriously be obviated by appropriate laxatives. As a preventive remedy for the young, and as a general bracer for persons of a re- laxed fibre, especially of the female sex, it fiequenlly proves highly advantageous; and, in general, the popular idea is a correct one, that the glow wliich succeeds the use of cold or temperate baths, is a test of their utility ; while, on the other hand, their producing chilliness, head-ache, &c., is proof of their being pernicious. Cold water is a powerful tonic, but, like all others, is liable to the same abuses, consequently, in this respect, capable of doing mischief.

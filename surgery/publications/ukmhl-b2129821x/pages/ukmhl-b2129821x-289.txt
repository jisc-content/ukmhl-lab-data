In some families it is an hereditary disease, though parents who have been affected with it have sometimes a healthy and robust offspring. Children of the poorer and more profligate classes are those most commonly affected with it; although there are circumstances which conduce to it, such as a damp cold residence, impure air, want of at- tention to cleanliness, bad nursing, want of ex- ercise and food, weakness, &c.

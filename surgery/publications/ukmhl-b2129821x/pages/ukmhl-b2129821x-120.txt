58 are improper. Those who are liable to frequent returns of this disease, or to obstructions of the kidnies, should carefully guard against getting wet in the feet, as well as against all exposures to cold; they should prefer lying on mattresses to feather beds, use moderate exercise, and by no means to drink any kind of wine in which tar- tar abounds. INFLAMMATION OF THE BLADDER. The symptoms of this disease are tension and pain at the bottom of the belly, with a frequent desire to make water, difficulty, in voiding it, or a total suppression of it, together with a frequent desire to go to stool, and fever. This complaint is oftener a consequence of in- flammation in the neighbouring parts than a primary affection of the bladder itself. It is sometimes, however, occasioned by a suppression of urine, and consequent distension of the blad- der, or by a stone of considerable size lodged within it. The treatment advised in inflammation of the kidney will be proper here; except that we should not give liquids in great quantities, lest the blad- der be distended beyond what it is capable of bearing.

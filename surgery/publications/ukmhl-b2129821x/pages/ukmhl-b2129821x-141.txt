79 OF FEVERS. This class of diseases is usually divided into intermittents or agues, remittents, and continued fevers, from their taking up different times in the order of their natural duration; some having a number of paroxysms, which follow each other in regular succession at some distance of time, as in agues J in others, fresh paroxysms imme- diately succeed the crisis or turn of the former, so as scarcely to leave the patient entirely free from fever, as is the case in remittents; and in others again, there is such a quick succession of paroxysms, that one comes on before there is any visible abatement of the febrile symptoms, as in continued fevers. There are several species of fever compre- hended under the head of typhus ; there is, how- ever, no specific difference in them, as they seem to arise either from a different degree of power in the cause, varying circumstances in the cli- mate or season of the year, peculiar constitu- tional affection; or, from some particular state of the fluids, which gives a predisposing tendency to putrescency.

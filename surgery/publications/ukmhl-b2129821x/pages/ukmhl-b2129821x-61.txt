li ELECTRICITY* AS A CURATIVE AGENT. Electricity is a property which certain bodies possess when nibbed, heated, or otherwise excited, whereby they attract remote bodies, and frequently emit sparks or streams of light. The efficacy of electricity in the cure of several diseases has been supported by many very respectable authorities. It has, for a length of time, been employed as a local and general stimulus; though, for the most part, in consequence of it being chiefly found in the hands of people little acquainted with the nature and extent of disease, the proper time of applying it, and the extent to which it ought to be carried, to constitutions in which it is likely to prove serviceable, it is adopted in the most absurd and contradictory manner possible, and not too without being accompanied with danger. When a person stands upon an insulated stool, and is charged with electricity, and this is gradually withdrawn, the pulse becomes quicker and the perspiration is in- creased. If sparks be drawn from a part, there is a glow of lieat, and often, if these be powerful, redness and in- flammation. Electricity is certainly a powerful stimulus to the nerv- ous system, but has all the bad qualities of a high excitant. If applied too strong, it exhausts the irritability, and thus it is that lightning kills ; if not applied sufficiently strong, * The ancients GrÂ»t obaerved this property in amber, which they colled Electrum and hence aroRC the word Electricity. Eleclrieitas, from elee- Irum, r]\eKrpov, from r]\^Klwp, the sun, because of its bright shining colour; or from tA/cw, to draw, because of its magnetic power.

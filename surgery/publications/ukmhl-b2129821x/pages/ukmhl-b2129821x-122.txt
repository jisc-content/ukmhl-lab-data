Rheumatism and gout are, however, sometimes combined. In these cases, it is neither necessary nor possible to discriminate between the two. The attacks of the latter are chiefly in the spring of the year and the beginning of winter, and the disease sel- dom appears at an earlier period of life than from thirty-five to forty.

23G Blisters, applied to swellings of the glands have brought them to a quicker state of suppuration than they would otherwise have done. The sti- mulus of a blister, where the swelling of a gland has become indolent and stationary, rouses it to a state of renewed action, which probably may dispose it to suppurate. In some instances, both blistering and electricity have, however, been attended with a directly contrary effect, and have occasioned them to disperse, a step which should invariably be attempted on the first appearance of any tumour, or enlargement of any joint, by swelling of the parts surrounding it. The means usually employed for this purpose, are local bleeding, sea-water, poultices, hemlock, mercu- rial ointment, electricity, blisters, &c.; sea-bath- ing, where it can be adopted, will prove the best of all remedies, &;c. When the process of suppuration is sufficiently advanced, the contents of the abscess are to be discharged at once with the lancet, if the collec- tion be not large; if otherwise, by repeated puncturation at proper intervals, closing the orifice to prevent the access of external air, in the same manner as practised by skilful surgeons, in the treatment of an abscess of the loins, into whose hands the disease, at this stage, equally as in the first, should more particularly be entrusted.

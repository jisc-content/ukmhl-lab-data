26 mild diaphoretics, (medicines which promote perspiration), and the patient to be kept warm : poultices of bread and milk, with roasted onions, will be of service. Should the disorder not yield to these measures, the patient should lose some blood, apply a blister behind the ears, and take a composing draught or pill going to bed. The rheumatism may sometimes produce these complaints : a bladder, filled with warm water, and applied as warm as it can be borne, will be of use; also camphorated spirits rubbed behind the ear. A noise in the ear may be relieved by passing the vapour of aromatic plants into it through a funnel, or by introducing a few of the following saponaceous drops into it, viz.— Take Oil of Almonds; Spirits of Compound Lavender; Tincture of Castor—of each '. 1 drachm: Mix. If the pain in the ear be merely spasmodic, or arising from a defluxion of acrid matter into its cavity, cupping and bleeding the back of the head will be beneficial; putting into the ear, at the same time, dossils of lint or cotton, dipped in the oil of almonds, to which a little of the oil of amber and tincture of opium may be added.

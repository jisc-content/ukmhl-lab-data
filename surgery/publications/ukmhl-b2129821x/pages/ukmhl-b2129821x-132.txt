70 the symptoms remit^ a brickdust-like sediment; and there is a tendency to sweating in the course of the disease, which rarely brings rehef with it. There is scarce a disease, says the late Dr. Clarke, more hereditpy than rheumatism : and, he might have added, no disease is so apt to shift from one part to another. Chronic rheumatism affects the head, shoulders, knees, and other large joints ', and continues shift- ing from place to place without either fever or inflammation; continuing in this manner for a length of time, it ultimately goes off, leavi^ig the parts that have been affected in a weak state, and very liable to returns of the complaint on the ap- proach of moisture, or damp weather. There is little or no danger from rheumatism in its chronic form; but those who have once been attacked with it are more or less liable, ever afterwards, to be visited with it; and a stiff joint is sometimes the consequence of frequent relapses. Nor is acute rheumatism accompanied with much danger, as it usually goes off spontaneously, or is removed by the timely employment of proper remedies, although in some cases the patient has been de- stroyed by a general inflammation, and now and then by a translation of the rheumatic affection to some part of vital importanceâ€”such as the head, lungs, heart and stomach.

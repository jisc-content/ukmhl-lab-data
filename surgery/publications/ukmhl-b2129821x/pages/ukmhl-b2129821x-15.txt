V tlons, they produce the most dangerous diseases, and frei qnently death itself. DISEASES FROM ACCIDENTS OR EXTERNAL CAUSES. From the innumerable accidents and dangers to vvhicli mankind are exposed, they frequently have thdr limbs broken, receive wounds and contusions, sometimes incur- able ; and these misfortunes although they owe, in the first place, their origin to external causes, often terminate in internal diseases. DISEASES FROM INTERNAL CAUSES. The dangers which come from without are not less, nor fewer in number, than those which arise from within. At every breath man pours forth a deadly poison both to him- self and to others. Not only is the effluvia of the lungs hurtful, but from every part of the body there issues forth a most subtle and poisonous matter, perhaps of a putrescent nature, which, from having been long accumulated, and not having been suffered to diffuse itself through the air, infects the body with the most grievous diseases; neither does it stop here, but produces a contagion which spreads far and M ide among mankind. From too much or too little exercise of our animal powers also, no small danger ensues. By in- activity either of body or mind, both are impaired ; and tho danger is not much diminished from over-exertion. By- moderate use, all the faculties of the mind, as well as all the parts of the body, are strengthened and improved; and here nature has appointed certain limits, so that exercise can neither be too much neglected, nor too much increased with impunity. For this reason, those who use violent ex- ercise, as well as those who consume their time in sloth and idleness, are equally liable to diseases of different kinds; for this reason also, the bad effects of too great or too little employment of the mental faculties.

He was distinctly methodical in his habits. Rising at a quarter to eight, he went out at half-past nine, and woe betide the coachman if he were late with the carriage. He returned for dinner at half-past one, and would go out again at three o’clock. He was a most abstemious man, and for many years he would never allow stimulants on his dinner- table. At a later date, when he gave dinner parties, he would join in the wine to a slight extent, but directly the guests had departed he would say to his nephew, James Stephens, “ Put those glasses and decanters out of my sight.” His nephew Edward Stephens lived next door, but the two houses intercommunicated.

36 LIFE OF JOSEPH JORDAN He foam’d at the mouth with the rage he felt, And he wrinkled his black eye brow, “That rascal Joe would be at me, I know, But zounds, let him spare me now! ” Then out they sent the ’Prentices— The fit it left him weak;— He look’d at his brothers with ghastly eyes, And faintly struggled to speak. “All kinds of carcases I have cut up, And now my turn will be; But, brothers, I took care of you, So pray take care of me. “And my ’Prentices now will surely come And carve me bone from bone; And I who have rifled the dead man’s grave Shall never have rest in my own. “Bury me in lead when I am dead, My brethren I entreat; And see the coffin weigh'd, I beg, Lest the plumber should be a cheat. “And let it be solder’d closely down, Strong as strong can be, I implore; And put it in a patent coffin, That I may rise no more. “If they carry me off in the patent coffin, Their labour will be in vain; Let the Undertaker see it bought of the maker, Who lives by St. Martin’s Lane. “And bury me in my brother’s church, For that will safer be; And I implore, lock the church door, And pray take care of the key.

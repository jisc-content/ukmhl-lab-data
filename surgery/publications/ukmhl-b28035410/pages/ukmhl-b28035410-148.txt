122 LIFE OF JOSEPH JORDAN the first stage of the operation becomes now a great disadvantage. “ I am happy to present an instrument invented by Mr. Jordan possessing both these properties by a contrivance which displays great ingenuity. An extract from Mr. Jordan’s letter explains it ... . which, with a needle on this principle, I beg leave to submit to the Society. “ When an aneurism needle is passed under an artery and turned in the wound the length of the needle is the diameter of a circle, a segment of which must be formed or the parts forced from their natural position; and, although the diameter may be diminished by increasing the curve of the instrument, to do this with the common aneurism needle requires more force than it is desirable to use. When the instrument is passed under the vessel its shape is worse than useless. But if we could convert the shaft into an elastic substance its flexibility would render the turning of the instrument easy. With this view I have formed the enclosed needle. “ Cut off about five-sixths of the shaft of a common aneurism needle, and to the curved portion join a piece of elastic steel of a convenient length, in the upper part of which is an eye for the passage of a ligature. To give this the necessary firmness I have a small silver sheath which slides upon the steel and covers it except at the superior part where the eye is formed. This sheath opens laterally, and may be taken off when the firmness of the needle is no longer necessary.” The following account of the invention of the Ear Speculum is of interest:—“In 1845 Charles Jordan, a clever mechanic and inventor, and a nephew of Joseph

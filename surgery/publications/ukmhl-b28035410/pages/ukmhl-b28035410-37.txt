CHAPTER II. Professional Career. Mr. Jordan commenced practice in 1812, joining Mr. Stewart who was already well established in “ Four Yards,” a narrow street oft’ Back King Street. The title of the firm being Bancks, Stewart and Jordan. Apparently the junior partner soon retired, for we find him advertising in “ Wheeler’s Chronicle,” Sept. 14th, 1814, as follows : — To Students of Anatomy. Mr. Jordan will open rooms for the study of Anatomy on the 1st of October. Bridge Street. In the advertisement for 1815 the word “ re-open ” is used, and the address given is 69 Bridge Street; the dissecting- room being apparently in Back Queen Street, off Deans- gate, a few minutes’ walk from the house.* * With reference to this it seems proper to mention that at the distribution of prizes at the Chatham Street School of Medicine, in 1854, Mr. Brigham said :—“I attended his opening lecture (Mr. Jordan's) when we only mustered a dozen, Anatomy and Surgery being at that time the prinripal pursuits and the principal sources of study.” On the same occasion Mr. Wilson, senior 8urgeon to the Infirmary, said :— “ I was an early participator in the benefits conferred by Mr. Jordan on the whole profession. Indeed, I might almost say I have been a student under Mr. Jordan myself. I do not know any man except Mr. Jordan who would have sacrificed the time, the ease, and every- thing else, even his own advancement, for the purpose of affording his professional brethren an opportunity of following their medical studies. I remember Mr. Abemethy telling me that when he began lecturing on Anatomy he had only four pupils in a small room in Bartholomew Close; and I remember the time when Mr. Jordan taught Anatomy in a small place in Back Queen Street. If I were to attempt to give the students present the beau-ideal of a medical man (for remember the medical man is not a student merely in his younger days, but he continues to study through life) it would be Mr. Jordan.”

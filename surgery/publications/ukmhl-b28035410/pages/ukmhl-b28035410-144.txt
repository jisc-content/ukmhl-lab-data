120 LIFE OF JOSEPH JORDAN Winter Lectures. General and Microscopic Anatomy and Physiology, by Mr. Turner, Mr. Smith and Dr. Roberts. Descriptive Anatomy and Dissections, by Mr. Lund. Chemistry, by Mr. Stone. Principles and Practice of Medicine, by Dr. Watts and Dr. Brown. Principles and Practice of Surgery, by Mr. Dumville and Mr. Southam. For Session 1857-58 the notice is repeated with the same address. Mr. Greaves giving the introductory lecture. For Sessions 1858-59, 1859-60, 1860-61 again the same locality of the school appears. The addition to the title of the school shows that the union of the two schools was on a different footing from those amalgamations that had previously occurred. This fact and the change of address rather favour the view that the Pine Street School became amalgamated with that of Chatham Street, and not vice versa. The alteration of the address from Chatham Street to Grosvener Street was more apparent than real, for the building was at the corner of the two streets named, a new entrance being made in Grosvener Street. After occupying these premises five years the school removes to Faulkner Street, where considerable altera- tions had taken place. Part of the museum was taken away, and the space added to the lecture theatre beneath to increase its height. What was left of the museum was still a large room with a roof light at one end. The dissecting room on the top storey still extended from Faulkner Street to Pine Street.

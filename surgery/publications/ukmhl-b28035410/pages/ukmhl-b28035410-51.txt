39 PROFESSIONAL CAREER The third night as by lanthorn light, Through the churchyard they went, He bade them see, and shew’d them three, That Mister Joseph sent. They look'd askance with greedy glance, For the guineas they shone bright, For the Sexton on the yellow gold, Let fall his lanthorn light. And he look'd sly with his roguish eye, And gave a well-timed wink; And they could not stand the sound in his hand, For he made the guineas chink. And conscience, late that had such weight, All in a moment fails, For well they knew that it was true * A dead man tells no tales. And they gave all their powder and ball, And took the gold so bright; And they drank their beer and made good cheer Till now it was midnight. Then, though the key of the church door Was left with the Parson his brother, It open’d at the Sexton’s touch, Because he had another. And in they go with that villian Joe, To fetch the body by night, And all the church looked dismally, By his dark lanthorn light. They laid the pick-axe to the stones, And they moved them soon asunder; They shovell’d away the hard-prest clay, And came to the coffin under.

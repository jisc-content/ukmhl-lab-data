32 LIFE OF JOSEPH JORDAN .and enabled the possessor of it to legally charge for medicines. All honour is therefore due to this Society for the liberal view it took of Mr. Jordan’s teaching, and the medical profession owes a considerable debt of gratitude for the concession. Much credit is due also to Dr. Hull for his persevering efforts with the College authorities in urging the import- ance of the matter. Nothing could have appeared more hopeless than the task which Mr. Jordan had set himself to perform, the destruction of the monopoly held by the London schools and the establishment of provincial medical education. The teaching of Anatomy and Surgery was entirely engrossed by the Metropolitan schools, and it must be remembered that many teachers were also examiners, so it was of course to their interest to retain the monopoly of teaching entirely in their own hands. It may be very easily perceived therefore that they were loth to share with others a privilege which was so profitable to themselves. Their large and lucrative fees would be re- duced, besides the power and authority, almost autocratic, which year after year they held over students and the profession. The first and most important privilege was now obtained and Mr. Jordan received the reward of all his labours. Ilis satisfaction was rendered complete when Dr. null received a letter dated April 24th, 1821, from the Royal College of Surgeons of London, recognising Mr. Jordan’s lectures. It is here given in facsimile.* The recognition by the College was not of vital import- ance after the Apothecaries’ Hall had been so generous, because the diploma of the former was simply optional, The original is now in the Owens College.

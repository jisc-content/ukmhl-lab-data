PREFACE. In putting forth this tribute of admiration for the originality, industry, and perseverance of a Manchester Worthy, whose work was the germ of provincial medical schools, I am actuated by two motives; a desire to give the present generation some idea of the early days of medical education in this city, and a wish to place on record some particulars of the life of him who initiated it. As regards the former it has never been adequately dealt with, the only work bearing on the matter being The Memoirs of Thomas Turner, which deals with the subject only after the important movement had been in operation some years; and, as regards Mr. Jordanâ€™s share in it, many of his friends have considered that his merits have not been sufficiently recognised. Mr. Walter Whitehead is the first public speaker I have known who hus done his memory justice, and this he did in a most generous manner in his Presidential Address to The British Medical Association iu Manchester in 1902. No apology, I trust, is needed for recalling the portrait of an old world type of character, and I regret that I am not able to give a fuller account of his private life, or a more representative selection from his correspondence. The frontispiece, by Alfred Brothers, gives a good idea of Mr. Jordan as he appeared in 1853; the other photograph, too, and the bust in the Infirmary are excellent likenesses of him at an earlier date, as is also the portrait in the library of the Owens College.

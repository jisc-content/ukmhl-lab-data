PROFESSIONAL CAREER 53 resembled that of a parliamentary election. A contrast to the present mode of electing members of the staff.* The election of Mr. Jordan as Surgeon to the Royal Infirmary was the acme of all his aspirations. He now stood in the same proud position which had been occupied by his old friend and master, William Simmons. The appointment was also some consolation for the loss of his Medical School, and finally healed the soreness which had existed for so many years amongst his rivals. In the Session 1838-9 Mr. Jordan, after repeated requests, joined the Pine Street School as co-lecturer on Surgery with Mr. Ransome, junior, and afterwards by Dr. Stephens’ persuasion, he transferred the contents of his Museum to the new Museum of the School, erected in 1842. He lectured for one session only, Mr. Ransome continuing alone until 1850, when by the request of the School, Mr. Jordan resumed his lectures for this and the following year, when he retired altogether from school work, and confined himself to Clinical lectures at the Infirmary, Mr. Covency succeeding him. Mr. Jordan presided at the distribution of prizes at the Chatham Street School of Medicine at the close of the Session 1853-4, and as the proceedings are interesting the most important parts of the Report are here given. Mr. Southam, the Registrar, addressing Mr. Jordan, said: — * I may say here that at that time it was customary for the members of the staff to visit Infirmary patients at their own homes, as there were no paid officers to do this work. Sometimes Mr. Jordan would delegate this duty to an advanced student. Each member of the staff had his own pupils and retained the fees paid by them. This was the cause of much jealousy, as the more popular men had the greater number of pupils.

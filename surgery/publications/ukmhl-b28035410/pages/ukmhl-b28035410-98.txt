80 LIFE OF JOSEPH JORDAN matters he would carry the snuff loose in his waistcoat pocket, lie admitted that such slavery was anything hut beneficial, and he tried to break himself of the habit by buying his snuff in small quantities in paper. He would put this package on the sideboard at the far end of the room, and was thus compelled to rise from his chair every time he wanted a pinch, but soon tiring of this labour, he carried his paper to the table, then changed the paper for a common snuff-box, and would finally return to his favourite. The snuff he used was called Wilson’s S.P. The maker’s name was Wilson, but the brand was a joke, referring to George Wilson, Chairman of the Anti-Corn Law League, and his inseparable companion, S. P. Robinson, the Secretary. It is with pleasuro that I am able to record some words of an old student at the Chatham Street School, which throws further light on the quaint idiosyncrasies of my subject: — “ Mr. Jordan was a very active and popular surgeon, willing to praise any good work, and desirous of imparting instruction to students. Prompt to repress hypercritical opinions. On one occasion he answered what a student presumed to be a poser, by asking him to describe the branches of the femoral artery, much to the confusion of the man. If a foreign celebrity introduced any practical novelty we soon knew what Langenbeck and Bonnet thought of it, these men being his great ideals at that time. When he came home from his annual trip to Paris he announced the fact for a month afterwards by mounting a tricolour over his cravat. Sometimes foreign guests were entertained at his house, when for a time the most modern furniture was introduced, to be returned to the makers on their departure.”

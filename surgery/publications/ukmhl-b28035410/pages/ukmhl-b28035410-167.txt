JAMES STEPHENS, L.S.A., M.R.C.S., F.R.C.S., Was surgeon to St. Maryâ€™s Hospital, having been appointed in 1841. He resigned in 1848. He was a clever and cautious obstetrician, and invented an instrument for replacing the prolapsed funis. He published a report of thirty-three successful cases in The Lancet. He died on December 1st, 1887, aged 72. At the time of his death he was the oldest practitioner in Manchester except John Boutflower. James Stephens must have been a hard worker, as may be gleaned from what has been stated in connection with his brother and his uncle. He did not become famous in any way, owing probably to his domestic ties and his extensive private practice; yet he had abilities which unfortunately lacked direction, and he had no ambition, otherwise his opportunities for advancement were such as fall to the lot of few men. He was, however, of great service in enabling his distinguished relatives to devote so much of their attention to the educational part of medical science by attending to their interests at home, and for this I think he deserves to be remembered. He had a lively disposition and cheerful temperament, was gentle, thoughful, kind, and free from the impulsiveness of his uncle; in his later years he was quiet and fond of reading. He had a retentive memory and could i-eadily quote poetry. One of his favourite books was Abercrombie on the Intellectual Faculties. His profes- sional favourites were Watson, Graves and Trousseau.

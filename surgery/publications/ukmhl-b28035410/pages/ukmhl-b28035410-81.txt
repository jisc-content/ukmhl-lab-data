65 METHODS OF TEACHING Medical Schools, because they supplied, in addition to lectures, practical experience in medicine and surgery. No doubt it was a desire for completeness and to fix responsibility that animated the College of Surgeons to issue the celebrated ordinance of 1824, which has already been quoted, though unfortunately the proceeding bore another complexion, and was unjust to the Anatomical Schools which had been of excellent service in the education of the medical student. All the early volumes of The Lancet go to show that the teachers in the Medical Schools who formed the officers of the Corporations, viewed the teachers in the private schools with jealousy. There was really no occasion whatever for this jealousy if the Anatomical Schools were not regarded as Medical Schools, except on account of the selfish reason that they attracted students •who otherwise would have attended the privileged hospital schools. But the condition of completeness of medical education varies according to the development of knowledge. There- fore what was complete in 1811 could hardly be considered so in 1824. To my thinking, a Medical School in all its branches ought to be conducted under one roof. The only schools that complied with this condition in England which were recognised were the four hospital schools in London—viz., the united borough hospitals of Guy’s and St. Thomas’, St. Bartholomew’s and The London. Previous to the ordinance of 1824, the College of Surgeons had made in 1823 a bye-law, to the effect that certificates only of the winter course of dissections would be accepted. This was directed against the Anatomical Schools, where the teaching of Anatomy was continuous summer and winter, and so the education of the student was cheapened, as less time had to be spent in London.

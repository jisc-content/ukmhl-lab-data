The Winter Session of this Institution commenced on Wednesday last, when the Introductory Lecture was given by Mr. Turner to as large an auditory as perhaps was ever assembled in the theatre of the establishment. Mr. Thorpe, Mr. Ainsworth and other lecturers of the Pine Street and Marsden Street Schools were present. The lecturer commenced by stating “ that he had been requested by his colleagues to deliver an address embracing the importance and nature of the medical profession, and the means which that Institution afforded for the acquisition of sound medical and chirurgical knowledge “ During the recess the lecturers had not been idle, but had endeavoured to make such arrangements as they deemed likely to be advantageous to the students and to the prosperity of the School. “ Amongst the alterations with regard to the lecturers and lectureships, had been the appointment of Mr. Stephens to the Demonstratorship of Anatomy, and to the Lectureship of Pathology. “ Mr. Stephens, as they all knew, had been long engaged in the Anatomical branch of his profession, and had showrn himself at various times an excellent Pathologist.” In 1835 a few changes are noticeable: — Pine Street Medical School. Anatomical Demonstrations by Mr. Stephens and Mr. Stott.

EDWARD STEPHENS 135 “ He was one of the most dexterous men in the use of the forceps, and in all midwifery operations I have met with; he had an extensive knowledge of Gynaecology, especially of the diagnosis of abdominal and pelvic tumours .... he had great aptitude for teaching, and was a learned man in every branch of his profession.” Edward Stephens generally acted as locum-tenens for his colleagues in their absence. He continued Mr. Turner’s lectures when that gentleman was ill; also the lectures on Medicine after the death of Dr. Howard; and Mr. Heath’s lectures on Midwifery on various occasions. Even after his retirement Mr. Turner and Mr. Smith used to send him the students’ papers for examination. He is stated by Herbert Renshaw to have been “ a very gentle and polite surgeon.” The portrait here given of him is taken from a photographic copy of the painting by William Bradley, now in the Owens College. The following letter is interesting in connection with a once celebrated club in Manchester: — My Dear Sir,— Let me remind you that the members of John Shaw’s Club dine together to-night at the Star, at six o’clock. It is a half-crown dinner with extra for punch. You and your brother will be expected, and will have to pay the half-crown whether you attend or not. Yours truly, John Leigh. Thursday morning (1855 probably.—F. W. J.). James Stephens, Esq.

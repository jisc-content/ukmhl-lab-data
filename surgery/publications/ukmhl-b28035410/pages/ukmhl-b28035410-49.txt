PROFESSIONAL CAREER 37 “And all night long let three stout men The vestry watch within; To each man give a gallon of beer And a keg of Holland’s gin, “ Powder and ball and blunderbuss, To save me if he can, And eke five guineas if he shoot A Resurrection Man. “And let them watch me for three weeks, My wretched corpse to save; For then I think that I may stink Enough to rest in my grave.” They put him in lead when he was dead, And with precaution meet; First they the leaden coffin weigh, • Lest the plumber should be a cheat. They had it solder’d closely down, And examined it o’er and o’er, And they put it in a patent coffin, That he might rise no more. For to carry him off in a patent coffin, Would, they thought, be but labour in vain, So the Undertaker saw it bought of the Maker, Who lives by St. Martin's Lane. In his brother’s church they buried him, That safer he might be; They lock’d the door, and would not trust The Sexton with the key. And three men in the vestry watch, To save him if they can. And should he come there, to shoot they swear A Resurrection Man.

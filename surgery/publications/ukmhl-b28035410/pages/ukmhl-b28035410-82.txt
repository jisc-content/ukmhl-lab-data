LIFE OF JOSEPH JORDAN 66 Mr. Jordan’s School was on a somewhat different footing from other private undertakings, for he, ever desiring to conform to the regulations of the College and Hall, had held his courses of dissection only in the winter. To show how the vario\is subjects of education were mixed, and that a certain course of lectures might include more lhan its title would lead one to infer, it is to be mentioned, that at Guy’s Hospital Medical School the teaching of Physiology, or the laws of the Animal Economy as it was termed, at first combined with that of Midwifery, was afterwards, and until 184G, combined with that of Anatomy; and, as an instance of a step in the right direction, we know that Sir Astley Cooper separated Anatomy and Surgery, and then appointed assistants to superintend the students in the dissecting room, instead of, as hitherto, the lecturer accompanying his students thither, and repeating there what he had just been telling them in the lecture theatre. Before the passing of the Apothecaries Act in 1815 students had not the benefit of a prescribed course of study, and the facilities for teaching were very imperfect. The only requirements of the College of Surgeons were certificates of attendance on one course of Anatomy, and one course of Surgery, to which was added, in 1813, a certificate of one year’s attendance on the surgical practice of a hospital. At that time medical education was in a very lax condition, and medical students were at liberty until March 19, 1824, to obtain their training how they pleased so long as they were able to pass their examination. Hospital attendance, too, was on an indifferent basis. I contend therefore that the schools of Anatomy whose certificates were recognised by the College of Surgeons were practically Medical Schools.

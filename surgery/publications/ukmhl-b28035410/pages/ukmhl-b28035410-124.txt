Mr. Turner’s, I should imagine, were of a popular character of a high order, for he lacked the means of giving systematic instruction, and he practically said so himself, both in the above advertisement, and in a speech which he made at the Albion Hotel (see page 76 of his Memoirs) at the conclusion of his first course: — “ Secondly, to do away with the idle prejudice that Anatomy and Physiology are exclusively professional studies .... that they are branches of general know- ledge, and not limited in their utility to the extension and improvement of the healing art.” Ibid., Oct. 2, 1824. School of Anatomy. Mr. Jordan will commence his Anatomical course of lectures on Anatomy and Physiology on Monday, Oct. 4. Hours of attendance, 12 to 1. Dissections as usual.

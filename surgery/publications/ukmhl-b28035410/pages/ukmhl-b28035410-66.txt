LIFE OF JOSEPH JORDAN no man, and one calculated to do honour to the post about to bo filled Mr. Jordan, it was well known, had been connected with the town many years. He commenced his career in that valuable Institution, and about 1813 first practised in Manchester; and about 1814 began those courses of lectures which laid the foundation of a School of Anatomy which had distinguished this town in no ordinary degree. John Brooks, Esq., seconded the nomination of Mr. Jordan, who he said had been thrice a candidate, the first time having only eight or ten votes; the second time running a good second on the poll, and he hoped that this time he would be placed at its head. He exonerated Mr. Fawdington and his committee from all share in the canvass which had been commenced before the death of Mr. Whatton on an unfounded report of his decease, and also from taking any part in the publication of an anony- mous letter which appeared in the newspapers of Saturday last. Mr. It. C. Sharp, in nominating Mr. Joseph Atkinson Itansome, said:—“On the part of his committee he had been authorized to say that the anonymous letter adverted to by Mr. Brooks had not emanated from them.” A poll having been demanded on the part of the can- didates, it immediately commenced in the TWn Hall, and, for ladies, in the Matron’s room of the Infirmary, and at its close at two o’clock the numbers were: — Mr. Jordan Mr. Fawdington . Mr. Itansome Mr. Heath . 46G 350 54 30 Mr. Jordan was accordingly declared duly elected.

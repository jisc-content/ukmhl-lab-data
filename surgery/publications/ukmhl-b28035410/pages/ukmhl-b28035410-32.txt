LIFE OF JOSEPH JORDAN 22 inoculation, contribute to protract the existence of such a curse on mankind as the small-pox.” The following is the communication Mr. Jordan received from Mr. Simmons, referred to in his letter to his mother : Dear Sir,— It will always give me true pleasure to hear of your welfare, and therefore I need not say how glad I was to hear from you. Your flattering and grateful expressions are more than equivalent to any opportunities of instruction I may have thrown in your way; and that they have redounded to your comfort or advantage in life will always yield me consolation. Go on in the same line of diligence and integrity, and the conclusion will be alike honourable, as the outset has been commendable. The novelty of your situation will wear off by degrees, and then if not fond of a military life you will at least become reconciled to it. Recluse life is hardly suited to the habits of a professional man, and in the Army the best knowledge of mankind is to be acquired. We live by the world, and to know it we must mix with the world. I am sorry you are so long kept out of the Assistant- Surgeoncy; meanwhile, however, you will be making some progress in military tactics, and eventually may become a general officer. Of you, it may be truly said that you fight with a two-edged sword—the lancet, the symbol of safety and of life, and that foul instrument of destruction by which so many have fallen to rise no more. Thus fortified what shall appal you? Nothing particular has occurred here since you left us; in quietude, however, it would be unnatural for us to remain long. . . . Mrs. Simmons desires to be remembered to you

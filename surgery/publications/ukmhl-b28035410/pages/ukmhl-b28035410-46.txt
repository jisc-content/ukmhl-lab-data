LIFE OF JOSEPH JORDAN .34 readily perceived by the examiners in London that students from Manchester were particularly well equipped in Anatomical knowledge. During the whole time that Mr. Jordan lectured on Anatomy (upwards of twenty years) he never had a student rejected in this subject. This point was alluded to in the House of Commons in the arguments and discussions on the necessity of passing an Act of Parliament to legalize the prosecution of Anatomy, occasioned by the discovery of the horrible murders com- mitted in Edinburgh by Burke and Hare in 1828, as a means of obtaining bodies for dissection.

Graves were rifled in the night time and the bodies carried away in

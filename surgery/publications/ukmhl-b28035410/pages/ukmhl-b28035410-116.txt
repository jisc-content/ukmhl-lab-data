94 LIFE OF JOSEPH JORDAN words from a notice which appeared in the Manchester Guardian for April 2, 187-3 : — “ Mr. Jordan’s nature was most simple and gentle, and yet he was possessed of perfect coolness and determination. Without ever being a brilliant surgeon, he was to the last a thoroughly large-minded and large-hearted medical man. Never prejudiced against a project because it was new, nor bigoted in its favour because it was old. Indeed, of him it might truly be said, * Both gladlie would he learne and gladlie teache.’ ” The Lancet of May 31, 1873, says of him: — “ In his private practice, extending over fifty years, Mr. Jordan ever showed a special devotion to the relief of the sickness and suffering of the poor. His great professional skill often unpaid, and even supplemented by a liberal purse, and that genuine kindred feeling which ever doubles the value of a gift, won for him the blessing of thousands.”

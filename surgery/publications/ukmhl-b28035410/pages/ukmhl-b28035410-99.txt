81 PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS The last remark alludes to Mr. Jordan’s personal indifference to appearances. His professional rooms were anything but comfortable, and as a lifelong bachelor the lack of a wife’s presence about the house was evident. His sitting-room was the only apartment that wore any approach to comfort, and was filled with old-fashioned furniture, the walls being adorned with portraits, two of which, by William Bradley, were of Edward and James Stephens.* Adjoining this room was a well-stocked library, which contained many valuable anatomical works. His bedroom was a very curious place. The chief article of furniture was a simple camp-bed. The walls were covered with book-shelves, and there were books on the floor and books on the chairs. They were piled about so that he could easily reach them when in bed, and he would not allow anyone to disturb them. There was hardly room to stir. The only time that thorough cleaning operations could take place was when Mr. Jordan was away in Paris, and on his return he would complain that he could not find any book he wanted. It is related of Mr. Jordan by Mr. Whitehead, that a medical friend, who called upon him when he was ill, espied a set of bones under the bed, which Mr. Jordan said he found convenient to keep at hand that he might distract himself by their study. A former house-surgeon of the Infirmary says of Mr. Jordan. “ He was a good clinician, a cool operator, was trusted and looked up to by students as a sound teacher and a man of original thought.” Mr. Jordan prided himself on the steadiness of his hand.

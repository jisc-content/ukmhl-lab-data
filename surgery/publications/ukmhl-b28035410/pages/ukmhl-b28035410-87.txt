METHODS OF TEACHING 71 respect was in advance of liis time in the provinces, and even in advance of the hospital Medical Schools of London, and so foreshadowed the method of teaching of modern times. The writer of the History of Guy’s Hospital, published in 1892, on page 472, says : — “ In comparing the teaching of the medical schools of to-day with that of its predecessor in the last century, the changes which we recognise seem to be chiefly due to two causes—firstly, the institution of examining corporations from which legal qualifications to practise, or it may be degrees, can only be obtained by the fulfilment of certain requirements; and, secondly, the tendency to supplement professional teaching of any branch of science by practical demonstration of the methods employed in its investigation. “ The multiplicity of classes and demonstrations which now form so large a Bhare of the curriculum of any medical school is partly the result of the former cause, but is mostly due to the discovery that scientific instruction can be more readily conveyed by actual work at the subject than by the older and decaying method of formal lectures upon it.” When Mr. Jordan started his school there was no legal qualification to practise required, and therefore no curri- culum.

119 APPENDIX In the prospectus of the school a feature is made of the presence of demonstrators in the dissecting room to direct the students in their work; and of the opportunity of private dissection by medical practitioners. These were special features of Mr. Jordan s school. (In fact, Mr. Southam stated in his report for the Session 1853-4 that the school was established in order to carry on the system of instruction so well begun by Mr. Jordan.) While the elaborate courses on Microscopy and Chemistry show that the lecturers were determined to take full advantage of advancing knowledge. Another old student tells me that in 1856 there were about eighty students, and that this school was a formidable competitor of the Pine Street School; the lecturers made strong efforts and spared neither time nor labour to make it a success. Dr.-Stephens says:—“ The school became so perfect, and the premises were so commodious and well lighted, that it soon began to supersede the old dark building in Pine Street, and it would probably have done so altogether, but an amalgamation took place in 1856. So now there is only one school as it was in the beginning of Mr. Jordan’s time.” The last advertisement of the Chatham Street School was for the Session 1855-6, and the next announcement of the Pine Street School being: — Manchester Royal School of Medicine, being the amalgamated medical schools of Manchester. Session 1856-57. The winter term will commence this day, October 1st, at 12 o’clock, when the introductory address will be delivered by Mr. Turner at the school, Grosvener Street, Piccadilly.

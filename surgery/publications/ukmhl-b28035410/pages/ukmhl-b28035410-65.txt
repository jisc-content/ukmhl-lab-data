Mr. Walter Barton Stott, who was a demonstrator at Mount Sreet, and surgeon to the New Bailey Prison, was one of the founders of the Children’s Hospital, along with Dr. Alexander, in 1831.* In 1835, owing to the sudden death of Mr. Whatton, the post of Surgeon to the Royal Infirmary again became vacant, and Mr. Jordan renewed his candidature. The election took place on December 31st, 1835, in the large room of the Town Hall, at one of the most largely attended meetings of Governors ever assembled, and on the motion of Mr. Ednrund Buckley, Mr. John Bradshaw, the treasurer of the Institution, was called to the chair. Mark Philips, Esq., M.P., in proposing Mr. Joseph Jordan as in every way qualified to fill the vacant office, expressed his regret for the bereavement which the Institution had suffered in the death of Mr. Whatton, in whom they had lost, not merely a townsman, highly talented and gifted, not merely a scholar and a gentleman, but, in connection with that Institution they had lost a most valuable public officer; and nothing could have in- duced him (Mr. Philips) to come forward to propose an individual to fill that vacancy which the death of Mr. Whatton had created, if he had not felt satisfied that he was supporting the claims of one who had a full right and title to their best consideration as an eminent professional * See Manchester Guardian for April 13th, 1878, for obituary notice of Mr. Stott.

EDWARD STEPHENS 129 Surgery of Berlin on August 14th, 1828. He was the first Englishman, I believe, to pass this examination; it was conducted entirely in Latin. A copy of his Thesis for the Leyden degree is still in existence; it is entitled ‘‘ Disser- tatio Medica Inauguralis de Amaurosi Functionale.” The following letter, addressed to Mr. Jordan, 4, Bridge Street, is interesting : — Dear Uncle,— .... I have undergone a very strict and very severe examination this morning by Professor Sandifort in private. I can assure you it does them honour; they give a very strict, a very proper examination. Not a word was spoken in any language but Latin, and it lasted from eleven to one precisely. I did not expect so much as this, but I can assure you it is no joke passing at Leyden. I have three other public examinations to undergo, and to defend my Thesis in Latin for an hour in the Grand Hall of the University, where I shall be obliged to mount the rostrum, dressed in a black suit, black silk stockings, and a sword by my side. The day before the Thesis is defended it is the custom for the student to ride up and down the town in a carriage with his two Parnnymphs, as they are called, and leave a dissertation with each of the Professors. But I shall endeavour to avoid this if possible, being a stranger, but Paranymphs one is obliged to have; they are young men who are to support you in defending the Thesis, all which is conducted in Latin. After this, against the following morning, you have to prepare some anatomical dissection, such as the radial nerve and its branches. I am not afraid, I can assure you. I had no trouble with my examination with Professor Sandifort,

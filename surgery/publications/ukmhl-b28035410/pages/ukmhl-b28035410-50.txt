LIFE OF JOSEPH JORDAN 38 And the first night by lanthorn light, Through the churchyard as they went, A guinea of gold, the Sexton shew’d, That Mister Joseph sent. But conscience was tough, it was not enough, And their honesty never swerved; And they bade him go with Mister Joe To the devil as he deserved. So all night long by the vestry fire They quaff’d their gin and ale, And they did drink, as you may think, And told full many a tale. The cock he crew cock-a-doodle-doo, Past five! the watchman said; And they went away, for while it was day, They might safely leave the dead. The second night, by lanthorn light, Through the churchyard as they went, He whisper’d anew, and shew’d them two, That Mister Joseph sent. The guineas were bright and attracted their sight, They looked so heavy and new, And their fingers itch’d, as they were bewitch’d, And they knew not what to do. But they waver’d not long, for conscience was strong, And they thought they might get more, And they refused the gold, but not So rudely as before. So all night long by the vestry fire, They quaffed their gin and ale, And they did drink, as you may think, And told full many a tale.

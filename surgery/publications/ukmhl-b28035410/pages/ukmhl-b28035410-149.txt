123 APPENDIX Jordan, devised an instrument for examining the ear, for which his name deserves to be remembered, as the modern otoscope is merely an adaptation of it. He showed the instrument to his uncle, who immediately examined the inventor’s ear, and exclaimed, ‘By God! I can see the membrana tympani, which has never been seen before.’ ” Charles Jordan invented also an eye speculum, an electric barometer, an endoscope for examining the bladder, a photometer for the use of Sir H. Roscoe when Professor of Chemistry at the Owens College, and a variety of other instruments.

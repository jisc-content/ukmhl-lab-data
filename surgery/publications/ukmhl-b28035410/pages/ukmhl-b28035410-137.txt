Marsden Street School was the first of the medical schools in Manchester to introduce Medical Jurisprudence into the curriculum, though the subject was not required by Apothecaries’ Hall until 18-36. It was introduced into the Pine Street syllabus in 1833. The students at the various schools seem to have been on very good terms with each other, as I read in Dr. Stephens’ notes of students from other schools visiting Mount Street on interesting occasions. With regard to the lecturers, it is interesting to note that Mr. Radford, who had been lecturer at Mount Street, took Midwifery at the Marsden Street School at its open- ing.

In 1833 Mr. Radford was associated with Mr. Partington at the Pine Street School on the retirement of Kinder Wood. Mr. Davies was lecturer on Chemistry at both these schools simultaneously. In 1834 the Pine Street School advertised extensively in view of the competition of its rival, the Marsden Street School. Additional lecturers were appointed. 1. Anatomy, Mr. Turner, daily at 12.

28 LIFE OF JOSEPH JORDAN There are no particulars to he found relating to the place in Back Queen Street, except the reference to it in the foregoing note. No allusion is made to it in the adver- tisements, and Dr. Edward Stephens, who was apprenticed to Mr. Jordan in 1819, whose notes I am using, does not mention it.

The other served as the museum, which still contained a number of fine anatomical specimens, one of which, I remember, was

LIFE OF JOSEPH JORDAN 86 they were easily led away from their studies to consort with people whose company was dangerous. I again venture to draw upon the words of an old student who has supplied me with an interesting description of the man:—“As a student, I have very pleasant recollections of him, for he took notice of me, was glad to be questioned, and was always ready to help by answering anyone in his wish for information; he had a strong individuality not to be easily forgotten, old-fashioned in dress which never varied, a long brown coat often snuffy, a deep neckcloth or stock, and so so linen, giving the impression that he lacked a wife to look after him; the contrast between him and his well-groomed friend Mr. Turner was very marked. As a surgeon he was a close observer, kind and considerate to patients, especially to women and children, and soon arrived at his diagnosis. It was a treat to stand by him at such times, and be taught by him. Speaking to him about the difficulty of gaining all I wanted because little children could not describe their ailments, he replied, ‘There was one advantage, they can tell no lies.’ I am proud to have known and been cheered in my studies by so good a type of the surgeon of the middle of the last century as the late Joseph Jordan.” Mr. Jordan was one of the founders of the Chetham Society in 1848. He was elected a member of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society in 1821, was a member of the Natural History Society; and in 1857 was elected a Vice-President of the Manchester Royal Institution. Mr. Jordan, together with other gentlemen, formed an Antiquarian Society, which they called The Order of Rosicrucians or Brotherhood of the Holy Cross. The first meeting was held at John Leigh’s house, 26, St. John

132 EDWARD STEPHENS students. Ilia brother James frequently rose from bed at 4 a.m. to prepare specimens for the class. After this was over the students would repair to the accident room of the Infirmary, go round the wards till noon, and then return to the school for the Anatomical lecture. At the end of the Session 1840—41 Dr. Stephens resigned the demonstratorship, Mr. Stott and Mr. Wm. Smith succeeding him. He retained the lectureship of Pathology until 1850-51 when he retired altogether from teaching, being succeeded by Dr. Renaud. Dr. Stephen’s health was much shattered by a dissec- tion wound from which I do not think he ever thoroughly recovered. He was twenty-five weeks in bed, he had five large abscesses in the arm and over the chest, and with all this a horrid malignant fever. He lost all hope of recovery. On his retirement he received a letter of regret from his colleagues which contained this resolu- tion : — “ That they have received with much satisfaction the intimation from Mr. Edward Stephens that Mr. Jordan will continue to lecture on Surgery during the ensuing session, and that Mr. Edward Stephens will lecture for Mr. Jordan whenever indisposition or engagements will prevent Mr. Jordan from meeting his surgical class.” Dr. Stephens says:—“When Messrs. Jordan and liansome resigned the lectureship of Surgery it was offered to me, but I declined it on account of ill-health and the great labour ataehed to it.” In a cordially expressed letter to him Mr. Turner says : —“ For although ill-health prevents you from acting as a teacher in the school we never fail to regard you as our colleague.”

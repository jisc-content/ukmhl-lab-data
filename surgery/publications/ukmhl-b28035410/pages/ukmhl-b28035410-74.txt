LIFE OF JOSEPH JORDAN 58 mean that state of mind which led Galen, in dissecting parts of the human body, to exclaim ‘ I feel while I am describing these things as if I were singing a hymn of praise to the Deity who made them,’ depend upon it you will never become eminent in your profession. “ In looking about in this great city you are struck with wonderful specimens of art, you admire the ingenuity and are astonished at the art of man. But you are studying Nature, and what is Nature but the Art of the Creator. Here, therefore, you are studying the perfection of art. If I were asked which part of the body is the most beautiful, I would say, that which you study the most, for the more you study it, the more you will be sensible of its beauties. Nor can you imagine anything so perfect. Unless you are impressed with these feelings, depend upon it, you have chosen a wrong profession, and I would advise you to leave it, for I consider a respectable shoemaker a much happier man than an ignorant surgeon, and whether you succeed or do not succeed in the world you will be equally unhappy.”

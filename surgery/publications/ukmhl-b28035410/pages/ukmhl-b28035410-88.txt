LIFE OF JOSEPH JORDAN imply that Manchester students had not yet been recognised. Turner viewed Jordan’s School with envy, and started in opposition with a scheme which was more ambitious, for it included the systematic study of subjects which were then regarded as somewhat of the extraneous order—viz., Materia Medica, Therapeutics and Botany. Mr. Jordan’s School afforded seeds for development which might have been taken as the germ of such a medical institution as Mr. Turner conceived when he took so much pains to establish his rival school. Here was an opportunity for Mr. Turner to gratify his ambition in establishing a school worthy of this important city by approaching Mr. Jordan on the subject, for he admits that rising members of the profession have been educated in this neighbourhood. As events have occurred, though undoubtedly Mr. Turner was the founder of the Pine Street School, and had a large share in the development of medical teaching in Manchester, yet there is no gainsaying the fact that Mr. Jordan, to take a wider view, was the real founder of provincial medical teaching in a systematic and regular form, and thereby broke down the monopoly of the London institutions. Credit is due to Mr. Turner for improving the facilities for medical training then in existence. But it must not be forgotten Mr. Jordan was the real pioneer of the movement. Therefore both teachers are entitled to equal honour. In conclusion, let me say that, in the transference of the Museum from the Pine Street School to The Owens College, it has been apparently forgotten, that a con- siderable portion of the specimens belonged to Mr. Jordan. They were deposited by him in the Museum of that School

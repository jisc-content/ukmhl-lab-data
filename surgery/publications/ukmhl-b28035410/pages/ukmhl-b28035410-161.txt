133 EDWARD STEPHENS He had been a teacher twenty-five years, viz., eight years at Mount Street and seventeen at Pine Street.” He found in one of the bodies at Mount Street an obliterated aorta, which he dissected out, and his brother James made a permanent preparation of it; it is now in the Owens College Museum. The case was reported in the North of England Medical Journal, August, 1830,* and a series of drawings of it were made by Mr. James, the artist. In the same museum there is another specimen made by Dr. Stephens showing the tanned skin of the neck with the mark of the rope with which the subject was hanged, along with the trachea and oesophagus. When the cholera raged in Manchester in 1832 Edward Stephens had the first case that occurred, and he was appointed one of the medical officers in connection with the epidemic. A warehouse in Jordan Street, Knott Mill, was taken and fitted up as a hospital for cholera patients. The doctor would go at 8.30 a.m., see the patients, and on his second visit at 11.30 would perhaps find the wards empty, the patients having died. The sadness of it all so affected him that he was taken ill himself. He had a very sensitive disposition. Another hospital was an old police-station next door to the Iiising Sun Inn, Shudeliill. The medical officer there wished to have a certain part of the body for dissection, and so he decapitated one of the dead, but the friends of the patient, wishing to see the body, opened the coffin; the absence of the head so enraged them, that crowds of people collected in a hostile manner, and pulled down the building. The doctor had to flee. •Quoted by The Lancet in 1830. Vol. 2, p. 732.

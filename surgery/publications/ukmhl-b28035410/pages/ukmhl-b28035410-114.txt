92 LIFE OF JOSEPH JORDAN the 1st Royal Lancashire Militia, on whose memoirs I have drawn for some particulars of this regiment, was at the beginning of the nineteenth centuiy influenced by his friend Dr. John Mitchell, of Lever Street, and afterwards of Mile End, Stockport, to such an extent as to become convinced that the millenium was approaching. His faith was, however, put to a crucial test by Mr. Jordan : — “ \ou believe that the millenium is within two or three years? Tell me candidly.” “ Certainly, I do.” “ And then will come the thousand years’ reign of the saints upon earth?” “ Certainly.” “ All things will be held in common by all men; there will be no such word as property, and that within the next two years.” “ Most certainly.” “ Then, Hibbert, I will give you, at this moment, five years’ purchase of all your property.” The offer, it is needless to say, was not accepted. Another intimate friend and pupil of Mr. Jordan’s was Thomas Bellot, surgeon R.N., brother of Henry Bellot, Surgeon to the Stockport Infirmary. He translated the remaining portion of “ Galen on the Hand,” which Mr. Jordan had commenced. He translated also the Aphorisms of Hippocrates, and wrote a treatise intending to prove the Sanscrit origin of the English language. In the copy he presented to Mr. Jordan he inserted this address: — “ Josepho Jordan, illustri medico, hunc librum honoris et observantiae causti dono dedit vetus amicus auctor editorque. Thomas Bellot, R.N. Kalendis Martiis. MDCCCLVI.”

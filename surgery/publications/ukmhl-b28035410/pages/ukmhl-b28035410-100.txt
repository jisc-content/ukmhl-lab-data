LIFE OF JOSEPH JORDAN 82 taken by Mr. Brothers in 1850, a copy of which forms the frontispiece of this work, he is represented holding the letter from the College of Surgeons recognising his lectures. The text in the original photograph can he made out with a magnifying glass. Dr. Stephens, in writing of Mr. Jordan, says : — “ He adopted a plain style in lecturing, preferring, as he said, pure English words to their scientific synonyms, in order that his remarks might be quite lucid and under- standable. His manner of teaching is peculiar, essentially his own, much in the Abernethian style, mixing dry details of anatomical description with anecdote and jokes, sweeten- ing with interesting physiological views. Nothing so dry and dull, but he would make it interesting. He was always eminently successful in forming first>rate ardent students, who ultimately became excellent practical surgeons, as the present generation (1861) of medical men, especially surgeons, in this and neighbouring counties testify. “ No man ever carried with him more than Mr. Jordan the attachment and respect of his pupils. His class at the Infirmary was always the most largely attended. “ Speaking constitutionally of Mr. Jordan one may very properly say of him, as The Lancet says of our Premier, “ he is a physiological phenomenon ”; he enjoys all the juvenile energy, pleasantry and alacrity for business that belong to men in middle life, alive to all that is new, enjoy- ing a keen appetite for any improvement in our art, which he immediately puts to the test of trial, and adoption if good, rejection and condemnation if otherwise. He had a cheerful disposition, a sound condition of body, a good digestion waiting on appetite, and, withal, temperance both in eating and drinking.

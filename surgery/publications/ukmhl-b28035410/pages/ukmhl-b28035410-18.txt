PREFACE I feel, in a manner, qualified to undertake a work of this nature, from the fact that I was brought into frequent association with Mr. Jordan, during the time that I was apprentice to his nephew, James Stephens. Also I have in my possession a number of papers written by Edward Stephens, in 1859, for the purpose of supplying George Wilson, Mark Philips, M.P., and Milner Gibson, M.P., with the informa- tion necessary in their endeavour to obtain some mark of Her Majesty’s favour for Mr. Jordan. These papers were confided to me by Mrs. Wilson, and they have proved of the utmost value in the preparation of this work. I have pleasure in hereby expressing my thanks to the following ladies and gentlemen, who have kindly supplied me with much useful information, and for access to records, etc.: F. Renaud, M.D., F.S.A.; F. A. Southam, M.A. (Oxon.), F.R.C.S.; William Bale, Esq., M.R.C.S.; Thomas Knox (Mr. Jordan’s coachman); Thomas Pinder, Esq., M.R.C.S.; Edward Stone, Esq.; the Editor of The Lancet; the Author of The Life and Times of Thomas Wakley; Francis Fowke, Esq., Secretary of the British Medical Association; J.

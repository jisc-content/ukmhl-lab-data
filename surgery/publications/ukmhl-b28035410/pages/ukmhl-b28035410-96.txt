LIFE OF JOSEPn JORDAN 78 filled his life, and he had no leisure for anything else. Everything which did not directly influence his calling had to be set aside. lie was enthusiastic in his Infirmary work, and always considered it of more moment than his private practice. No patient, however wealthy, would have precedence on his attention, if he felt it his duty to go to the Infirmary first. He visited the institution most days when I knew him, which was towards the close of his career as hospital surgeon, and he was always ready at unusual times to attend there in cases of emergency. In appearance Mr. Jordan was tall and spare, lie had a commanding, dignified presence, with characteristic features. He possessed a buoyant and happy disposition,* was quick at repartee, and had a merry laugh which was quite infectious. He was popular with all classes of society, and especially with students as a clinical teacher. He was the subject of a parodied version of The Fine Old English Gentleman. He and his yellow carriage were well known objects in Manchester. One of Mr. Jordan’s intimate friends was Dr. Hull, celebrated for his advocacy of the Caesarian operation (he was a very busy man, and was possessed of great endurance and hardiness. He use to rise at six o’clock, and it was no uncommon occurrence for him to ride to Lancaster or Buxton or other distant place). I am informed that Dr. Hull often sought Mr. Jordan’s advice for surgical cases, and that it was not an unusual circumstance for the doctor to call for him at four o’clock in the morning, Jordan meanwhile growling * One day, in his old age, when he was in a merry mood, he proposed that he and I should go to Knott Mill Fair, which had been for many years an annual institution in the city. I remember he trudged along in quite an independent way, and thoroughly enjoyed threading his way through the crowds of people and seeing the shows.

70 LIFE OF JOSEPH JORDAN early training, Mr. Jordan was evidently fitted for tlie career of a medical teacher. An apprenticeship with him was therefore something to be desired in those days, and was very different from an apprenticeship with a mere practitioner. It would to some considerable extent supply the needs of Mr. Turner’s idea of a preparatory education, and it supplied the knowledge the student required to enable him to pass his examinations. It must be remembered that at the beginning of the nineteenth century apprenticeship was the only means of acquiring professional knowledge, and to improve the system would be the first consideration of the reformer. Improvement in medical training is one benefit that resulted from the establishment of provincial Medical Schools, though, with their development during the last thirty years to the present high degree of excellence, apprenticeship has, with doubtful advantage, been abolished. Mr. Turner must have spent his own pupilage to some purpose, for he left Bristol in the autumn of 1815, and entered as a student at Guy’s, under Sir Astley Cooper. He passed his College of Surgeons and Apothecaries’ Hall examinations in 1816, and in the summer of that year wrent to Paris for further studies, lie therefore did remarkably well, and must evidently have received an excellent preparatory education to enable him to pass his examinations in so short a period after his arrival in London. There is no doubt that his experience as an apprentice was as valuable to him in shaping his future career as Mr. Jordan’s experience and observations were to him, though the final development of their plans differed materially. Mr. Turner had theory and lectures in view, Mr. Jordan a practical or experimental method, and in this

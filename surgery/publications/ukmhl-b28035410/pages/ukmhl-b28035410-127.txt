103 APPENDIX in the Anatomical lecture-room, Pine Street, behind the Infirmary. Syllabus of the course may be had at the room, Lying-in Hospital or Xo. 11, King Street. Another notice states that: — Mr. Dalton will give early in the session a course of Pharmaceutical Chemistry at the lecture-room, Pine Street. Dr. Stephens says of the Pine Street School: — “ There was no chemical laboratory, no museum, and no notice of qualification. Dalton’s course, I remember, was a very short one, and began late in the session. “ The official London programme of medical study was not followed nor established. And as the school did not open for over a month past the regulation date the.correct number of lectures could not be given.” Mr. Blackinore, who attended Dalton’s lectures, says that he commenced at seven p.m. and would continue to lecture until nine or even ten p.m., quite regardless of time, until, hearing the Infirmary bell ringing, the students would creep out to get their supper.

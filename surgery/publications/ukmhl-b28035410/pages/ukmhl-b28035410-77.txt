CHAPTER III. Methods of Teaching. At the beginning of the nineteenth century and for a considerable time afterwards, medical education in this country was entirely in the hands of London teachers. As we have seen Mr. Jordan’s Anatomical School altered this state of things. This was his claim, and I think we may concede that the School, after its recognition by the authorities, was a medical school in the fullest acceptation of the term, and was thus the first established Provincial Medical School, or, as Mr. Walter Whitehead expressed it in his excellent historical address to the British Medical Association in 1902:—“We must, I think, assign to Mr. Jordan the honour of being the real father of the Man- chester Medical School.” When Mr. Jordan began practice in 1812, it was with the intention of obtaining the means whereby he might, by teaching anatomy, break down the monopoly of the London Schools, and at the same time gratify his taste for his favourite pursuit. (This is tdiown by opening a dissecting-room so early in his career, for we find him advertising his Anatomical-rooms in 1814). His system was essentially practical, and was recognised as such.* He taught Anatomy by lectures and demonstra- tions, and superintended his pupils in their dissections. His advertisements show that his lectures were intended * See Mr. Southam’s remarks in the report of the Chatham Street School, for Session 1853-54.

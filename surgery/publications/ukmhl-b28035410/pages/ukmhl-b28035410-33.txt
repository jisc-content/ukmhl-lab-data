EARLY YEARS 23 as well as your young friends. ... I beg my best respects to Captain Levy and Mr. Wright. And with best wishes for your success, Believe me, Dear Sir, Very truly Yours, etc., W. Simmons. Manchester, 2^th March, 1807. Ensign Jordan, First Royal Lancashire Militia, Plymouth. There is not much to be said about Mr. Jordan's military life. He found it agreeable enough, and he made many acquaintances in the different towns visited by his regi- ment. A brother officer, the Lieut. Samuel Hibbert before referred to (afterwards Dr. Hibbert Ware) became his life- long friend. He also made the acquaintance of Sir James MacGrigor, Director General of the Army Medical Depart- ment. His regimental duties, it is well to observe, did not prevent him continuing his professional studies, especially in anatomy. The pursuit of this subject compelled him to beat a precipitate retreat from Kidderminster on account of the body of a child, wffiich he had obtained for dissec- tion, being discovered in his possession by the parents. He did not stay many years in the Militia, for he used jocosely to say he had no opportunity of being in action; the only service he saw was in the Nottingham riots. Feeling that a military life led to nothing except a pension he retired. In 1811 Mr. Jordan went to London for the purpose of continuing his studies before settling down to the pro- fession of a gentleman in private practice.

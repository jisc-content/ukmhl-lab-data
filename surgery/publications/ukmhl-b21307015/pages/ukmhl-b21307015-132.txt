102 MEDIAN AND ULNAR. deep layer of muscles in the fore-arm. It passes beneath the pronator quadratus muscle, and pierces the interosseous membrane near to the wrist. On reaching the posterior aspect of the wrist, it joins a large and remarkable ganglion, which gives off a number of branches for the supply of the joint. The Superficial palmar branch arises from the median nerve immediately above the annular ligament, and is distributed to the integument in the palm of the hand. The Digital branches are five in number ; two pass out- wards to the thumb; one to the radial side of the index finger; one subdivides for the supply of the adjoining sides of the index and middle fingers ; and the remaining one, for the supply of the adjoining sides of the middle and ring fingers. Ulnar Nerve. The Ulnar nerve runs along the ulnar side of the fore- arm to the wrist, crosses the annular ligament with the ulnar artery, and divides into two branches, superficial and deep palmar. Relations.—At the elbow the nerve lies in the groove between the inner condyle of the humerus and olecranon, and between the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle. At the commencement of the middle third of the fore-arm, it becomes applied against the artery, and lies to its ulnar side, as far as the hand. Branches.—The branches of the ulnar nerve may be arranged into four groups : — Upper arm - To the triceps muscle. Fore-arm - Muscular. Dorsum of hand - Dorsal branch. t-, T si j T Superficial palmar. Falm of hand < ^ 1 , 1 J L Deep palmar. A few filaments are given to the short head of the triceps. The Muscular branches supply the muscles on the ulnar side of the fore-arm. The Dorsal branch passes beneath the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris, at the lower third of the fore-arm,

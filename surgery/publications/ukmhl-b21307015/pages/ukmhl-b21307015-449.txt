NASO-PALATINE GANGLION. 419 ophthalmic nerve ; 2. a short thick branch from the pos- terior inferior angle to the inferior division of the third nerve, 5.; and, 3., a long filament, 7., which passes back- wards to the cavernous sinus, and communicates with the carotid plexus. 3. The Naso-palatine ganglion {fig- 49.) (Clo- * Fig. 49. The cranial ganglia of the sympathetic nerve. No. 1. The ganglion of Ribes. 2. The filament by which it com- municates with the carotid plexus (3.). 4. The ciliary or lenticular ganglion, giving off ciliary branches for the supply of the globe of the eye. 5. Part of the inferior division of the third nerve, receiving a short thick branch from the ganglion. 6. Part of the nasal nerve, receiving a longer branch from the ganglion. 7. A slender filament sent directly backwards from the ganglion to the sympathetic branches in the cavernous sinus. 8. Part of the sixth nerve in the cavernous sinus,' receiving two branches from the carotid plexus. 9. Meckel’s . ganglion (spheno-palatine). 10. Its ascending branches, communi- cating with the superior maxillary nerve. 11. Its descending branches, the posterior palatine. 12. Its anterior branches, spheno palatine or nasal. 13. The naso-palatine branch, one of the nasal branches. ’* The point where Cloquet imagined the naso-palatine ganglion to be situated. 14. The posterior branch of the ganglion, the Vidian nerve. 15. Its carotid branch, communicating with the carotid plexus. 16. Its petrosal branch, joining the angular bend of the facial nerve. 17. The facial nerve. 18. The chorda tympani nerve,, which de- scends to join the gustatory nerve. 19. The gustatory nerve. 20. The submaxillary ganglion, receiving the chorda tympani nerve from he gustatory. 21. The superior cervical ganglion of the sympa- thetic.

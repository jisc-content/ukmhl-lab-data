/ INTERNAL EAR. â€” VESTIBULE. 303 Internal Ear. The Internal ear is called labyrinth, from the com- plexity of its communications, and consists of a series of cavities which are channelled through the substance of the petrous bone. It is situated between the cavity of the tympanum and the meatus auditorius interims. The Labyrinth (fig. 35.) consists of the Vestibule, Semicircular canals, Cochlea. The Vestibule is a small oval cavity, situated imme- diately within the inner wall of the tympanum. It is named vestibule, from being, as it were, the hall of com- munication between the other cavities of the ear. It therefore presents a number of openings corresponding with these different cavities. They may be arranged, like those of the tympanum, into large and small. The Large openings are seven in number, viz. the Fenestra ovalis, Scala vestibuli, Five openings of the three semicircular canals. The Small openings are the Aqueductus vestibuli, Openings for small arteries, Three openings for branches of the auditory nerve. The Fenestra ovalis {fig. 34-. 3. fig. 35. 2.) is closed by the lining membrane of the vestibule, and by the foot of the stapes. It is the opening into the tympanum. The opening of the Scala vestibuli is the communication between the vestibule and the cochlea. The Aqueductus vestibuli is the commencement of the small canal which opens upon the posterior surface of the petrous bone. It gives passage to a small vein, which terminates in the superior petrosal sinus. The Openings for the arteries and nerves are situated in the internal wall of the vestibule, and correspond with the termination of the meatus auditorius internus. I he Semicircular canals are three bony passages which communicate with the vestibule; one is perpendicular

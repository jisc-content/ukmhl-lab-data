430 SYMPATHETIC. LUMBAR GANGLIA. splanchnic nerve, but receives many filaments from the solar plexus. The Spermatic plexus is formed principally by the renal plexus. The Inferior mesenteric plexus receives filaments from the aortic plexus. Lumbar Ganglia. The Lumbar ganglia are four in number, of the pecu- liar pearly grey colour, fusiform, and situated upon the anterior part of the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae. The Superior and inferior branches of the lumbar gan- glia are branches of communication with the ganglion above and below, as in the dorsal region. The External branches, two or three in number, com- municate with the lumbar nerves. The Internal branches consist of two sets ; of which the upper pass inwards in front of the abdominal aorta, and form around that trunk a plexiform interlacement, which constitute the aortic plexus ; the lower branches, 15., cross the common iliac arteries, and unite over the promontory of the sacrum, to form the hypogastric plexus, 16. The Aortic plexus is formed by branches from the lumbar ganglia, and receives filaments from the solar and superior mesenteric plexuses. It sends filaments to the inferior mesenteric plexus, and terminates in the hypogastric plexus. The Hypogastric plexus (fig. 50. 16.) is formed by the termination of the aortic plexus, and by the union of branches from the lower lumbar ganglia. It is situated over the promontory of the sacrum, between the two com- mon iliac arteries, and bifurcates inferiorly into two lateral portions, which communicate with the sacral ganglia and sacral plexuses of the spinal nerves. It distributes branches to all the viscera of the pelvis, and to the branches of the internal iliac artery. Sacral Ganglia. The Sacral ganglia, 17., are four or five in number. They are situated upon the sacrum, close to the anterior sacral foramina, and resemble the lumbar ganglia in

POPLITEAL REGION. 41 The deep popliteal fascia is Fig- 5.* tkjnj ant| wju removed with- out being observed, unless the dissector proceed cautiously. It is a part of the common deep fascia investing the entire limb. Beneath the deep fascia is a quantity of adipose sub- stance which fills up the whole popliteal space, from the bone and joint to the surface, and protects and supports the po- pliteal vessels and nerves. It will be recollected, that at the upper part of this popliteal space the great ischiatic nerve divides into two branches of nearly equal size â€” the popli- teal and peroneal. The popli- teal, 4., runs along the middle line of this space, from apex to apex of its diamond-shaped area. It is placed near to the surface, and is easily found on slightly separating the adipose tissue. This nerve divides the region into two equal halves: in the external one will be found two small nerves, branches of the popliteal and peroneal, called communicans poplitei and communicans * Fig. 5.

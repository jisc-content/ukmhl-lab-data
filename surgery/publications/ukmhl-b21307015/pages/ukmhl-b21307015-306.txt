276 NOSE. 2. The Muscles are brought into view by reflecting the integument: they are the pyramidalis nasi; compressor nasi; levator labii superioris alasque nasi; and depressor labii superioris alaeque nasi. They have been already described with the muscles of the face. 3. The Bones of the nose, are the nasal, and nasal pro- cesses of the superior maxillary. 4. The Fibro-cartilctges give form and stability to the outwork of the nose, providing at the same time, by their elasticity, against injuries. They are five in number, the Cartilage of the septum, Two lateral cartilages, Two alar cartilages. The Cartilage of the septum, somewhat triangular in form, divides the nose into its two nostrils. It is connected above with the nasal bones and lateral cartilages; behind with the ethmoidal septum and vomer; and below with the palate processes of the superior maxillary bones. The alar cartilages and columna move freely upon the cartilage of the septum, being but loosely connected with it by perichondrium. The Lateral cartilages are also triangular : they are con- nected, along the middle line, with the cartilage of the septum ; above, with the nasal bones; behind, with the nasal processes of the superior maxillaiy ; and below, with the alar cartilages. Alar cartilages. â€” Each of these cartilages is curved in such a manner as to correspond with the opening of the nostril, to which it forms a kind of rim. The inner portion is loosely connected with the same part of the opposite cartilage, so as to form the columna. It is ex- panded and thickened at the point of the nose to consti- tute the lobe; and, upon the side, expands into the oval form of the ala. Besides these, there are some small irregular cartila- ginous plates, which will be discovered in the course of the dissection, but which are unworthy a separate descrip- tion. The whole of these cartilages are connected with each other, and to the bones, by perichondrium, which, from its

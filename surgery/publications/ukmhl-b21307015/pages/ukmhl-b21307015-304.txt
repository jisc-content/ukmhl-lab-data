MEDULLI-SFINAL VEINS. 274 the theca vertebralis and the vertebrae. They commu- nicate freely with each other by means of a complicated plexus. In front they form two longitudinal trunks, which extend the whole length of the column on each side of the posterior common ligament, and are joined on the body of each vertebra by transverse trunks, which pass beneath the ligament, and receive the large vertebral veins from the interior of each vertebra. They pour their blood into the vertebral veins in the neck, into the intercostal and azygos veins in the thorax, and into the lumbar and sacral veins in the loins and pelvis, by means of communicating trunks, which escape at the interver- tebral foramina. The Medulli-spinal veins are situated between the pia mater and arachnoid; they communicate freely with each other, and form plexuses, and send branches through the intervertebral foramina with each of the spinal nerves, to join the veins of the trunk.

273 N 5 SPINAL VEINS. ception to these characters; its anterior root is larger than the posterior, and there is frequently no ganglion on its posterior root. After the formation of the ganglion, the two roots unite, and constitute a spinal nerve {Jig- 28. 19.), which escapes through the intervertebral foramen, and divides into an anterior branch, for the supply of the front half of the body, and a posterior branch, for the posterior half. The Spinal nerves are divided into Cervical 8 pairs Dorsal 12 Lumbar 5 Sacral 6 31 The Cervical nerves pass off transversely from the spinal cord; the dorsal are oblique in their direction ; and the lumbar vertical, and form the large assemblage of nerves at the termination of the cord called cauda equina. The Arteries of the spinal cord are, the anterior, pos- terior, and lateral spinal, which are derived from the vertebral; and branches from the intercostal and lumbar arteries, which enter the canal through the intervertebral foramina. The Veins of the vertebral column are divided into three sets: — Dorsi-spinal, Meningo-rachidian, Medulli-spinal. The Dorsi-spinal form a plexus around the spinous, transverse and articular processes and arches of the ver- tebrae. They receive the returning blood from the dorsal muscles and surrounding parts, and convey it into the meningo-rachidian veins. The Meningo-rachidian * veins are situated between . These veins are sometimes, though most incorrectly, termed “ sinuses: venous sinuses are canals existing in any structure, and merely lined by the internal coat of a vein ; but the meningo- rachidian veins have as many coats as other veins.

306 ORGAN OF TASTE. 2. The smaller or posterior to the vestibule and semicir- cular canals. The Anterior branch divides into a number of minute filaments which pierce the base of the cochlea, and expand in its mucous lining : others enter the modiolus, which is hollowed into canals, to receive them, and pass off through small openings in its circumference to expand in the mucous membrane covering the lamina spiralis. The Posterior or vestibular portion of the nerve divides into three branches, which"are distributedâ€”1. The larger to form the utriculus communis, and the membranous tubes of the perpendicular and horizontal canals. 2. To form the sacculus proprius. 3. The smallest to form the membranous tube of the oblique canal. The Arteries of the labyrinth are derived principally from the auditory branch of the inferior cerebellar artery. Organ of Taste. The Tongue is composed of muscular fibres, which are distributed in layers arranged in various directions : thus some are disposed longitudinally, others transversely, others again obliquely and vertically. Between the muscular fibres is a considerable quantity of adipose substance. The tongue is connected posteriorly with the os hyoides by muscular attachment, and to the epiglottis by mucous membrane, forming the three folds which are called frcena epiglottidis. On either side it is held in connection with the lower jaw by mucous membrane, and in front a fold of that membrane is formed beneath its under surface, which is named frcenum linguce. The surface of the tongue is covered by a dense layer analogous to the corium of the skin, which gives support to the papillae. A rapht marks the middle line of the organ, and divides it into symmetrical halves. The Papillce of the tongue, are the Papillae circumvallatae, conicae, filiformes, fungiformes. The Papillce circumvallatce are of large size, and from

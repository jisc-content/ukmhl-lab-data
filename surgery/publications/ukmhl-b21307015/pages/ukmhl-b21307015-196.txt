166 FACIAL NERVE BRANCHES. The Branches of the Facial Nerve are, Within the aque- ductus Fallopii After emerging at the stylo-mastoid foramen On the face J Tympanic, \ (Chorda tympani *}. ‘Communicating, Posterior auricular, Digastric, _ Stylo-hyoid, f Temporo-facial, \ Cervico-facial. The Tympanic branches are two small filaments, which are distributed to the stapedius and tensor tympani mus- cles. The Chorda tympani quits the facial nerve just before it emerges from the stylo-mastoid foramen. Entering the tympanum at its posterior and superior angle, it crosses its cavity between the handle of the malleus and long process of the incus, to its anterior inferior angle. It then escapes through the fissura Glaseri, and joins the gustatory nerve at an acute angle between the two pterygoid muscles. Enclosed in the neurilema j- of the gustatory nerve, it descends to the submaxillary gland, where it unites with the submaxillary ganglion. The Communicating branches are filaments which it receives from the glosso-pharyngeal and pneumogastric nerves. The Posterior auricular nerve ascends behind the ear, and crosses the mastoid process to the occipito-frontalis muscle; it gives branches also to the attollens and re- trahens muscles of the pinna. The Digastric branch supplies the posterior belly of the digastricus muscle. The Stylo-hyoid branch is distributed to the stylo-hyoid muscle. The facial nerve then enters the parotid gland, and divides into its two ultimate trunks — temporo-facial and cervico-facial. * The chorda tympani is not a branch of the facial, but being in close connection with it, and being given off from it like a branch, we have inserted it here lest it should be overlooked. •}• No proof of this independent relation of the chorda tympani to the gustatory nerve has yet been afforded by anatomy ; and recent physiological discoveries throw much doubt over the question.

Dorsalis pedis artery. Operation. — The dorsalis pedis artery is to be exposed, by making an incision two inches in length along the external border of the tendon of the extensor proprius pollicis muscle, beginning at the ankle joint. The artery, accompanied by its two veins and nerve, rests upon the bones of the tarsus, between the tendons of the ex- tensor proprius pollicis and extensor Iongus digitorum. Near to the base of the metatarsal bones it is crossed by the innermost tendon of the extensor brevis digitorum. Branches : Dorsalis pedis, Tarsea, Metatarsea, — interosseae, Communicating, Dorsalis hallucis,— collateral digital. The Tarsea arches transversely across the tai'sus, sup- plying the articulations of the tarsal bones and the outer side of the foot; it anastomoses with the external mal- leolar and posterior peroneal arteries. The Metatarsea forms an arch across the base of the metatarsal bones, and supplies the outer side of the foot; it sends branches (interossem) to the dorsal interossei muscles, and receives communicating branches (per- forantes) from the plantar arch. The Nerves supplying the dorsum of the foot are five in number : Internal peroneal cutaneous, External peroneal cutaneous, Anterior tibial. External saphenous, Internal saphenous.

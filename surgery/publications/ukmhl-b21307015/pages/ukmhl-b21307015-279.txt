FORNIX. 249 M 5 by the corpus fimbriatum, and on the other by the under surface of the thalamus opticus. The internal boundary of the lateral ventricle is the septum lucidum (Jig. 25. 7.). This septum is thin and semi- transparent, and consists of two laminae of cerebral sub- stance attached above to the under surface of the corpus callosum at its anterior part, and below to the fornix. Between the two layers is a narrow space, the Jifth ven- tricle (Jig. 24. 4.), which is lined by a proper membrane. The Fifth ventricle may be shown, by snipping through the septum lucidum transversely with the scissors. The corpus callosum should now be cut across towards its anterior extremity, and the two ends carefully dissected away. The anterior portion will be retained only by the septum lucidum, but the pos- terior will be found incorporated with the white layer beneath, which is the fornix. The Fornix [Jig. 24. 5.5. Jig. 25. 4.) (arch,) is a tri- angular lamina of white substance, broad behind, and ex- tending into each lateral ventricle, and narrow in front, where it terminates in two crura (Jig. 25. 5.), which arch Fig. 25.* * Fig. 2o.

354* LIVER. LIGAMENTS. VESSELS. the transverse fissure to the posterior border of the liver, is the fissure for the ductus venosus. The Fissure for the gall bladder is simply the depression in which that organ is lodged, and the fissure for the vena cava a deep notch, sometimes a short tunnel in the posterior rounded border of the liver through which the vessel passes. Upon the upper or convex surface of the liver are seen its ligaments : these are, the Two lateral, Longitudinal, Coronary, Round. The two Lateral ligaments are formed by the two layers of peritoneum, which pass from the under surface of the diaphragm to the liver. They correspond with the two lobes; one being the right, the other the left lateral liga- ment. The Longitudinal ligament (broad, ligamentum sus- pensorium hepatis) is an antero-posterior fold of peri- toneum, extending from the notch on the anterior border of the liver to the junction of the lateral ligaments. At the union of the longitudinal ligament with the two lateral, a triangular space is left which is uncovered by peritoneum, and where the diaphragm is in contact with the substance of the liver. The peritoneum around this space forms a kind of corona, hence it is called coronary ligament. The Round ligament is a fibrous cord, situated between the two layers of peritoneum in the anterior border of the broad ligament. It may be traced from the umbilicus to the notch in the anterior border of the liver, and through the longitudinal fissure to the vena cava. It is the re- mains of the umbilical vein of the foetus. The vessels entering into the structure of the liver are also five in number : they are, the Hepatic artery, Portal vein, Hepatic veins, Hepatic ducts, Lymphatics.

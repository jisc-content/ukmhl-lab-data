Vi PREFACE. nical operations of the Anatomist, the practical views and reflections of the Surgeon. The plan which he has pursued in the arrange- ment of the chapters, and in the description of the various regions, is that which seems to the Author the best calculated to assist the student in the dis- section of the body. He has commenced with the Lower extremity; which from the size and bold de- velopment of its component structures is usually selected for the “ coup d’essai ” of the young dis- sector. The student is first instructed in what manner to make his incisions and reflect the differ- ent layers; — the anatomy of each layer and of each organ is described as he approaches it; and tables and plans are continually introduced to enable him to embrace at a single glance the chief features of the different regions. The obscurity in which many parts of anatomy have been and are still involved, has led to a general indecision of description among anatomical writers which is highly injurious to the student, as tending to excite doubt and uncertainty in his mind, which it is most difficult and often impossible to entirely remove. To obviate as much as possible this diffi- culty, the Author has carefully selected the most frequently occurring phenomena as a standard, and has steadfastly adhered to that standard throughout the work; with the feeling that, if a subject be once well known, the occasional peculiarities and varieties maybe easily attained. Acting upon this impression, he has adopted a severity and terseness of description that might not be warranted by other circumstances.

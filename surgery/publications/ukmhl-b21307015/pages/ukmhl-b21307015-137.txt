107 DEEP LAYER. F 6 MUSCLES. bring into view the deep layer, which consists of five muscles. Deep Layer. Supinator brevis, Extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, â€¢ primi internodii pollicis, secundi internodii pollicis, indicis. The Supinator brevis cannot be seen in its entire ex- tent, until the radial extensors of the carpus are divided from their origin. It arises from the external condyle and external lateral ligament, and winds around the up- per part of the radius to be inserted into the upper third of its oblique line. The posterior interosseous artery and nerve are seen perforating the lower border of this muscle. The Extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis is placed imme- diately below the supinator brevis. It arises from the ulna, interosseous membrane, and radius, and is inserted, as its name implies, into the base of the metacarpal bone of the thumb. Its tendon passes through the groove im- mediately in front of the styloid process of the radius. The Extensor primi internodii pollicis, the smallest of the muscles in this layer, arises from the interosseous membrane and radius, and passes through the same groove with the extensor ossis metacarpi, to be inserted into the base of the first phalanx of the thumb. The Extensor secundi internodii pollicis arises from the ulna and interosseous membrane. Its tendon passes through a distinct groove in the radius, and is inserted into the base of the last phalanx of the thumb. The Extensor indicis arises from the ulna as high up as the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, and from the inter- osseous membrane. Its tendon is inserted into the apo- neurosis formed by the common extensor tendon of the index finger. When the posterior surface of the lower extremities of the radius and ulna is examined, a number of grooves will be seen, through which the tendons of the muscles of the posterior region of the fore-arm pass to their destina- tion upon the hand. In the subject, the posterior annular

390 SCROTUM. TESTICLES. Vessels and nerves The Arteries of the penis are derived from the internal pudic; they are the arteries of the bulb, of the corpora cavernosa, and of the dorsum of the penis. The Veins return the blood by the sides of the arteries to a plexus situated around the neck of the bladder. The dorsal vein is of very large size, and runs from before backwards in the groove on the dorsum of the penis. It passes between the two portions of the sus- pensory ligament, and beneath the pubic symphisis, to open into the vesical plexus. The Lymphatics pass outwards to the inguinal glands. The Nerves are branches of the internal pudic nerve and hypogastric plexus, and accompany each branch of the arteries. Scrotum. — The Scrotum (purse, leather bag) is the tegumentary fold which contains the testicles. It con- sists of two layers, the integument and dartos. The Integument is extremely thin, and in very large quantity. It is covered with hairs issuing obliquely from the skin, and having prominent roots. Along the middle line it is marked by a raphe. The Dartos is a contractile fibrous layer, situated im- mediately beneath the integument, and forming a distinct covering. It also divides the cavity of the scrotum into two equal chambers by a septum (septum scroti) of the same structure. The Structure of the dartos is intermediate between muscle and elastic fibrous tissue, and is called by some authors “ dartoid tissue.” Testicle. — The Testicles are lodged within the two cavities formed by the dartos, and are surrounded by an extremely loose and abundant cellular tissue, which con- tains no adipose substance. The Coverings of the spermatic cord and testicle, are the Spermatic fascia, Cremasteric, Fascia propria. The Spermatic fascia is the intercolumnar fascia de- rived from the external abdominal ring, which is carried downwards with the testicle in its descent in the foetus.

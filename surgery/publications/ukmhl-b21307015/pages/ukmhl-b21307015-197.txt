FACIAL NERVE.—COMMUNICATIONS. 167 The Temporo-facial gives off a number of branches which are distributed over the temple and upper half of the face, supplying the muscles of this region, and com- municating with the branches of the supra-orbital nerve. The inferior branches, which accompany Stenon’s duct, form a plexus with the terminal branches of the infra- orbital nerve. The Cervico-facial divides into a number of branches that are distributed to muscles on the lower half of the face, and upper part of the neck. The cervical brandies form a plexus {Jig- 14. 11.) with the superficial^ colli nerve over the submaxillary gland. The Facial nerve has been named sympatlieticus minor, on account of the number of communications which it maintains with other nerves. These will be best seen in a tabular arrangement: — In the petrous hone it communicates with At its exit from the stylo-mastoid fora- men, with { { Auditory nerve, Petrosal branch of Vidian, Otic ganglion.

From the supra-orbital, infra-orbital, and mental fora- mina, will be found issuing the terminal branches of the fifth nerve distributed to the face. They form plexuses of communication with branches of the facial nerve. Ascending obliquely across the face from the anterior inferior angle of the masseter muscle to the angle of the eye, is the facial artery; and descending along the anterior

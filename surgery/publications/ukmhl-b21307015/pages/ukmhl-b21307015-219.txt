189 internal jugular vein. The Petrous portion is in relation with the carotid plexus, and is covered by the Casserian ganglion. The Cavernous portion is placed to the inner side of the cavernous sinus, and is crossed by the nerves passing to the orbit, viz. third, fourth, ophthalmic branch of the fifth and sixth, and branches of the sympathetic. The Cerebral portion is lodged in the fissure of Sylvius. Branches. — There are no branches given off by the cervical portion of the internal carotid: from the other portions are derived the following : — Internal Carotid.— Branches. . Petrous portion Cavernous portion Cerebral portion Tympanic. Anterior meningeal, Ophthalmic, Anterior cerebral, Middle cerebral, _ Posterior communicating. The Tympanic is a small branch which enters the tym- panum through a minute foramen in the carotid canal. 'The Anterior meningeal is distributed to the dura mater and Casserian ganglion. The Ophthalmic artery enters the orbit through the foramen opticum, to be distributed to tbe globe of the eye and surrounding structures. Its course and branches are described with the dissection of the orbit. The three remaining arteries are described with the membranes of the brain, Chapter VI. The Veins of the head and neck are the external and internal jugular. The former receives its blood from the i temporal, internal maxillary, and auricular veins, and ! from the superficial parts of the neck, and descends !. obliquely backwards between the platysma myoides and | sterno-mastoid muscle, to terminate in the subclavian I vein behind the clavicle. The Internal jugular vein commences at the jugular • fossa, in the foramen lacerum posterius, where it receives the blood from the sinuses in the interior of the cranium. It descends the neck at first behind, and then to the outer side of the internal carotid artery, and continues its course within the sheath of the common carotid, and,

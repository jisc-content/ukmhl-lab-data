481 APPENDIX. The Circunijlexa ilii arises from the outer side of the external iliac, nearly opposite the epigastric artery. It ascends obliquely along Poupartâ€™s ligament, and curving around the crest of the ilium inos- culates with the ilio-lumbar artery. It is situated between the peritoneum and iliac fascia, and pierces the iliac and transversalis fasciae, to be distributed to the muscles of the parietes of the abdomen. The Coccygeus rmiscle is a tendino-muscular layer of a triangular form. It arises from the spine of the ischium, and is inserted into the side of the coccyx and lower part of the sacrum. It is in imme- diate contact with the lesser sacro-ischiatic ligament.

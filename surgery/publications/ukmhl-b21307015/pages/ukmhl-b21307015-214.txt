INTERNAL MAXILLARY ARTERY. 184 divide the cylinder of the artery completely across, so that the extremities of the vessels may be retracted within the superficial fascia. The middle coat of the artery becomes contracted by this proceeding, and is drawn within the external one. The internal maxillary artery passes inwards behind the neck of the lower jaw to the deep structures in the face ; we require, therefore, to remove several parts for the purpose of seeing it completely. To obtain a good view of the vessel, the zygoma should be sawm across close to the external ear, and the malar bone near to the orbit. Turn down the zygomatic arch with the masseter muscle. In doing this, a small artery and nerve will be seen crossing the sigmoid arch of the lower jaw, and entering the masseter muscle (the masseteric). Cut away the tendon of the temporal muscle from its insertion into the coronoid process, and turn it upwards towards its origin: some vessels will be seen entering its under surface; these are the deep temporal. Then saw the ramus of the jaw across its middle, and dislocate it from its articulation with the temporal bone. Be careful in doing this to carry the blade of the knife close to the bone, lest any branches of nerves should be injured. Next remove this portion of bone, and with it the external pterygoid muscle. The artery, toge- ther with the deep branches of the inferior maxillary nerve, will be seen lying upon the internal pterygoid. These are to be carefully freed of fat and cellular tissue, and then examined. 10. The Internal maxillary artery {Jig. 15.18 .Jig. 16. 4.) * Fig. 16. The internal maxillary artery, with its branches.

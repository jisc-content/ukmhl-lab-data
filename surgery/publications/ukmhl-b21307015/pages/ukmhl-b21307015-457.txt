GREAT CARDIAC PLEXUS. 427 variable size, situated beneath the arch of the aorta, to the right side of the ligament of the ductus arteriosus. It re- ceives the superior cardiac nerves of opposite sides of the neck, and a branch from the pneumogastric nerve, and gives olf numerous branches to the cardiac plexuses. The Great cardiac plexus is situated upon the bifurcation of the trachea, above the right pulmonary artery, and behind the arch of the aorta. It is formed by the convergence of the middle and inferior cardiac nerves, and by branches from the pneumogastric nerve. The Anterior cardiac plexus is situated in front of the as- cending aorta, near to its origin. It is formed by the communica- tions of filaments that proceed from three different sources; lstly, from the superior cardiac nerves, crossing the arch of the aorta ; 2ndly, from the cardiac ganglion beneath the arch ; and 3dly, from the great cardiac plexus, passing between the ascending aorta and the right' auricle. The anterior cardiac plexus supplies the anterior as- * Fig. 50. The sympathetic nerve, its entire length. No. I. The superior cervical ganglion. 2.

INTERVERTEBRAL SUBSTANCE. 449 Of the articular processes, Capsular ligaments, Synovial membranes. Of the spinous processes, Inter-spinous, Supra-spinous. Of the transverse processes, Inter-transverse. The Anterior common ligament is a broad and riband- like band of ligamentous fibres, extending along the front surface of the vertebral column, from the axis to the sacrum. It is intimately connected with the interver- tebral substances, and less closely with the bodies of the vertebrae. It is composed of three layers of fibres which are closely interwoven with each other ; the first layer con- sists of short fibres, which cross the intervertebral sub- stances from each vertebra to the next; the fibres of the second layer pass from each vertebra to the third above or below it; and those of the third, or superficial layer, from each vertebra to the fourth or fifth vertebra above or below it. The Posterior common ligament lies upon the posterior surface of the bodies of the vertebrae, and extends from the axis to the sacrum. It is broad opposite the inter- vertebral substances, to which it is closely adherent; and narrow and thick over the bodies of the vertebrae, from which it is separated by the communicating branches between the great spinal veins. The Intervertebral substance is a disc of fibro-cartilage, interposed between each of the vertebrae from the axis to the sacrum. It is composed of concentric layers, which diminish in density from the circumference to the centre, where it is soft, pulpy, and elastic. When examined from the exterior, each layer is found to consist of oblique fibres, which alternate in their direction, proceeding from left to right in one layer, and from right to left in the next, and so on for the rest.

LUMBAR PLEXUS. BRANCHES. 376 Fig. 6. page 53. The Genito-crural {Jig. 2. 5.) proceeds also from the second lumbar nerve. It traverses the psoas magnus from behind forwards, and runs down on its anterior surface to near Poupartâ€™s ligament, where it divides into two branches; genital, which passes through the internal abdominal ring, and is distributed to the spermatic cord; and crural, which supplies the integument on the inner side of the thigh. The Crural nerve {Jig. 2. 6.) is formed by the union of branches from the second, third, and fourth lumbar nerves. It passes beneath the psoas magnus, and runs along its outer border to the thigh, where it is distributed: see page 25. The Obturator nerve {Jig. 2. 12.) is formed by the union of two branches, one from the third and the other from the fourth lumbar nerve. It runs along the inner border of the pelvis, resting upon the pelvic fascia to the obturator foramen, through which it emerges to supply the muscles on the inner side of the thigh. The last lumbar nerve, tbe lumbosacral {Jig. 6. l.) descends into the pelvis to join the four upper sacral nerves, and assists in forming the sacral plexus.

INFERIOR MAXILLARY NERVE. 218 the other escaping through the outer wall of the orbit, to supply the temporal muscle. The Posterior dental branches {Jig. 22.13.) pass through small foramina, in the posterior surface of the superior maxillary bone, and supply the posterior teeth. The Middle and Anterior dental branches {Jig. 22. 14. 15.) descend to the teeth, the former beneath the lining membrane of the antrum, the latter through distinct canals in the walls of the bone. The Inferior maxillary nerve {Jig. 22. 17.) is the largest of the three divisions of the Casserian ganglion, and is augmented in size by the anterior root of the fifth, which passes behind the ganglion, and unites with the inferior maxillary, previously to its exit from the foramen ovale. By turning up the ganglion, this portion of the nerve may be easily seen, as a white rounded cord, altogether different in appearance and structure from the ganglion, against which it lies. * Fig. 22.

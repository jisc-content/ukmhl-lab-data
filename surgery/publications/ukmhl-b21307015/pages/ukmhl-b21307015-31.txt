PRACTICAL AND SURGICAL ANATOMY. INTRODUCTION. The human body is composed of certain principal struc- tures, which occupy the same relative position to each other, wheresoever they be examined. To obtain a good knowledge of these, is therefore the first duty of the dissector; the more particularly, that a just conception of their nature and position will greatly facilitate the future progress of his studies. These parts may be thus arranged, in the order of their superposition: â€” Integument, Superficial fascia, Deep fascia, Muscles, ' Vessels, Arteries, Veins, Lymphatics, Nerves, Bones and ligaments, and cellular tissue, the common connecting medium of the body, by which they are all held together. The business of dissection, therefore, consists in di- viding and turning aside the integument, the superficial fascia, and the deep fascia; in freeing the muscles from their enveloping cellular tissue ; in separating them, so as to display the vessels and nerves which lie between them ; and in following the latter to their ultimate rami- fications.

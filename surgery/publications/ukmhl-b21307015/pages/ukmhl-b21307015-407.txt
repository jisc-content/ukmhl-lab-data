CHAPTER IX. PELVIS AND ORGANS OF GENERATION. The student must now turn his attention to the study of the viscera of the pelvis; therefore, after examining their relative position from above, he should proceed to separate the os innominatum of the left side, so as to obtain a side view of these organs. For this purpose he must divide the pubis with the saw on the left side, a little external to the symphisis. Then let him cut through the psoas muscle and iliac vessels opposite the sacro-iliac symphisis, and divide the ligaments of that articulation. Next cut away with the scalpel the structures adhering to the inner surface of the pubis and ischium of the same side, force the os innominatum outwards and remove it altogether. We shall first consider the contents of the male, and then of the female pelvis. The Viscei'a of the male pelvis are the Bladder, Prostate gland, Yesiculae seminales, Rectum. A careful dissection of the side of the pelvis, when the os innominatum has been removed, will bring these organs distinctly into view. Bladder. â€” The Bladder is an oblong membranous viscus, situated behind the pubis and in front of the rectum. It is larger in its vertical axis than from side to side. It is divided into body, fundus, base, and neck. The body {fig. 45. l.) comprehends the middle zone of the organ ; the fundus, 2., its upper segment; the base, 6., the lower broad extremity, which rests upon the rectum ; and the neck the narrow constricted portion which is applied against the prostate gland. The bladder is retained in its proper situation by ligaments. I he walls of the pelvis, in addition to the bones by which they are formed, are lined internally by the peri- toneum ; the pelvic fascia, which is continued downwards from the iliac fascia, and is attached below to the sides of

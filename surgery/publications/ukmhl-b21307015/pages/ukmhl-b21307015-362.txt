332 DIRECT INGUINAL HERNIA. that canal must be laid open. The layers to be divided would then be, the Integument, Superficial fascia, Aponeurosis of the external oblique, Cremaster, Fascia transversalis, Peritoneal sac. Oblique inguinal hernia in its course through the spermatic canal lies above the spermatic cord. In rare cases the hernial protrusion may separate the components of the cord, so that some of them may lie in front of the tumour. Hence one of many reasons for extreme care and caution in operating for strangulated hernia. Turning again to the inner wall of the abdomen, and observing the position of the internal ring, the epigastric artery will be seen ascending to its inner side. And on the inner side of the artery is a smooth and rather depressed triangular surface, which is the seat of the protrusion of intestine in direct inguinal hernia. Direct inguinal hernia is named from passing directly through the external abdominal ring. It pushes before it a sac of peritoneum, the transversalis fascia, the conjoined tendon, and as it escapes at the external ring receives an investment from the intercolumnar fascia. Its coverings are therefore, the Integument, Superficial fascia, Inter-columnar fascia, Conjoined tendon, Transversalis fascia, Peritoneal sac. In escaping at the external ring it often carries the spermatic cord before it, so that the vessels of which it is composed become spread over the front of the hernial sac, or slip to one side. The Seat of stricture in all the varieties of inguinal hernia is always the neck of the sac. In recent oblique hernia the neck of the sac is formed by the internal ring. In old and large hernia, the internal ring is dragged down so as to

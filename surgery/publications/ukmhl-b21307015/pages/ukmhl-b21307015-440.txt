410 CONTENTS OF THE PERINEAL FASCIA. the bulbous portion of the corpus spongiosum with the artery enter- ing its posterior part; then let him cut across the corpus spongiosum at about its middle, and, turning it down from the rest of the penis, remove it altogether by dividing the urethra close to the deep perineal fascia. This proceeding displays the convergence of the crura penis, and the round opening in the deep perineal fascia, through which the urethra passes. The student must then carefully dissect off the an- terior layer o.f the deep perineal fascia, which will bring into view the membranous part of the urethra, the compressor urethrae muscle {Jig. 48. 8, 9, 10.), the artery of the bulb (13.), the internal pudic artery (12.) at each side, and two small yellowish bodies (11.) about the size of lentils, placed immediately beneath the urethra, Cowper’s glands. * Fig. 48. The structures contained between the two layers of the deep perineal fascia. No. 1. The symphisis pubis. 2. 2. The ramus of the pubis and ischium. 3. 3. The tuberosities of the ischia. 4. A triangular portion of the superficial fascia turned down, and shown to be continuous with the deep fascia (6.). 5.5. Two portions of the superficial perineal fascia, showing its connection to the ramus of the pubis and ischium. 6. 6. The posterior layer of the deep perineal fascia, the anterior layer having been removed. 7. The membranous portion of the urethra cut across. 8. The superior fasciculus of the compressor urethrae muscle of one side. 9. The inferior fasciculus of the compressor urethra;. - The two fasciculi (8.) and (9.), constitute Guthrie’s muscle of one side. 10. The pubic portions of the compressor urethrae, Wilsons muscles. 11. Cowper’s glands, partly embraced by the lower fas- ciculus of the compressor urethrae muscle. 12. The internal pudic artery passing posteriorly to the crus of the compressor urethra*

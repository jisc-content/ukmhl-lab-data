371 R 6 STRUCTURE. URETERS. fibrous capsule. When divided by a perpendicular sec- tion, it presents two structures, an external, vascular (cortical), which is of a red colour, and consists chiefly of the ramifications of vessels, and an internal, tubular (medullary), of a light colour and smooth texture, formed by the aggregation of the minute excretory tubuli. The tubuli are arranged into conical processes, called Cones. Each cone terminates in a Papilla, which is pierced by a number of minute openings, which are the terminations of the tubuli. The points of the papillae are invested with mucous membrane, which is continuous with the lining of the tubuli, and forms a small cup-like pouch, the Calyx, around the extremity of each papilla. There are from fifteen to twenty of these calices. Their union at each extremity, and in the middle of the kidney, forms three larger cavities, the Infundibula, and the union of the three infundibula constitutes the Pelvis, from which the ureter passes downwards to the urinary bladder. The Ureters are dilatable tubes, of about the size of a goose quill, and eighteen inches in length. They descend along the posterior wall of the abdomen, and cross, in their course, the psoas muscle, common iliac artery, and vas deferens, and terminate in the posterior and lateral part of the base of the bladder, after passing for some distance obliquely between its coats. At the concave border of the kidney, the vessels observe the following relation to each other from before back- wards, the veins are situated most superficially next the branches of the artery, and then the pelvis and ureter. The kidney is supplied with nerves by the renal plexus, which is derived from the solar plexus and from the lesser splanchnic nerve. The student must now examine the Muscles, which are situated on the posterior wall of the abdomen. These are the Diaphragm, Psoas magnus, Psoas parvus, Transversalis, Quadratus lumborum, Iliacus internus.

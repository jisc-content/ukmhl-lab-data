ELEVATORS OF THE OS HYOIDES. 161 cartilage of the first rib. It is inserted into the body of the os hyoides. The sterno-hyoidei are separated by a considerable interval at the root of the neck, but approach each other as they ascend. The Sterno-lhyroideus, broader than the preceding, arises from the posterior surface of the upper bone of the sternum, and is inserted into the oblique line on the ala of the thyroid cartilage. The Thyro-liyoideus is the continuation upwards of the sterno-thyroid muscle. It arises from the oblique line on the thyroid cartilage, and is inserted into the body and great cornu of the os hyoides. The Omo-hyoideus shoulder) passes obliquely across the neck from the scapula to the os hyoides. It arises from the upper border of the scapula, and from the tx-ansverse ligament of the supra-scapular notch, and is inserted into the body of the os hyoides. It is a double- bellied muscle, its extremities being muscular, and the middle a rounded tendon. The tendon glides through a loop formed by the posterior layer of the deep fascia, which serves it as a pulley. Actions. — The four muscles of this group are the depressors of the os hyoides and larynx. The three former drawing these parts downwards in the middle line, and the two omo-hyoidei regulating their traction to the one or other side of the neck, according to the position of the head. Third Group. — Elevators of the Os Hyoides. Digastricus, Stylo-hyoid, Mylo-hyoid, Genio-hyoid, Genio-hyo-glossus. These arc best dissected by placing a high block beneath the neck, and throwing the head backwards. The integument has been already dissected away, and the removal of the cellular tissue and fat brings them clearly into view. The Digastricus (§*$, twice, yao-Typ, belly) is fleshy at each extremity, and tendinous in the middle. It arises from the digasti’ic fossa, immediately behind the mastoid process of the temporal bone, and is inserted into a de-

CERVICAL PLEXUS. — BRANCHES. 205 Its Branches may be arranged into three groups, as- cending, descending superficial, and descending deep. Superficialis colli, Ascending Auricularis magnus, Occipitalis minor. ” Acromiales, Descending { Superficial Deep Claviculares. Communicans noni, Phrenic, Muscular. The Superficialis colli {fig- Id. 11.) crosses the sterno- mastoid muscle obliquely, and divides into two branches; one is distributed to the integument on the side of the neck, the other ascends to the submaxillary region, and forms a plexus with the cervical branches of the facial. The Auricularis magnus {fig. 14. 13.), the largest of the three, curves around the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid, and ascends by the side of the jugular vein to the external ear, supplying that organ and the integument over the parotid gland and side of the face. It communicates in the parotid gland with the facial nerve. The Occipitalis minor {fig. 14. 14.) ascends along the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid muscle, and is dis- tributed to the integument on the posterior part of the head. The Claviculares {fig- 14. 15.) and acromiales are several large branches which descend over the clavicle, and are distributed to the integument of the chest and shoulder. The Communicans noni is a long branch formed by filaments from the second and third cervical nerve: it descends and forms a loop with the descendens noni over the sheath of the carotid vessels. The Phrenic nerve is formed by filaments from the third, fourth, and fifth cervical nerves, receiving also a branch from the sympathetic. It descends to the root of the neck, resting upon the scalenus anticus muscle, then crosses the first portion of the subclavian artery, and enters the chest between it and the subclavian vein. Within the chest it passes through the middle mediastinum,

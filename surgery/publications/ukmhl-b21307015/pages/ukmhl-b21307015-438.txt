408 INTERNAL PUDIC ARTERY. — BRANCHES. under the name of dorsalis penis. Its branches are — Within the pelvis — Middle hemorrhoidal; In the perineum — External hemorrhoidal (3 or 4), Superficialis perinei, Transversal is perinei, Arteria bulbosi, Arteria corporis cavernosi, Arteria dorsalis penis. The External hemorrhoidal arteries are three or four small branches given off by the internal pudic while behind the tuberosity of the ischium. They are distributed to the anus, and to the muscles and fascia in the anal region. The Superficial perineal artery is given off near the attachment of the crus penis: it pierces the connecting layer of the superficial and deep perineal fascia, and runs forwards in front of the transversus perinei muscle, and along the groove between the accelerator urinae and erector penis to the scrotum, to which it is distributed. It gives nutrient branches to the perineum as it passes forwards. One of these, larger than the rest, crosses the perineum, resting on the transversus perinei muscle, and is therefore named transversalisperinei. The three remaining arteries are the proper vessels of the penis; they are distributed to the corpus spongiosum, corpora cavernosa, and dorsum penis. The Artery of the bulb (Jig. 48. 13.) is given off from the pudic nearly opposite the opening for the transmission of the urethra: it passes obliquely inwards between the two layers of the deep perineal fascia, and pierces the anterior layer to enter the corpus spongiosum, to which it is distributed. The Artery of the corpus cavernosum (Jig. 48. 14.) pierces the crus penis, and runs forwards in its interior, supplying its cellular structure. The Dorsal artery of the penis (Jig. 48. 15.) ascends between the two crura and the symphisis pubis to the dorsum penis, and runs forwards by the side of the sus- pensory ligament in the groove between the corpora cavernosa to the glans, distributing branches in its course to the body of the organ and to the integument.

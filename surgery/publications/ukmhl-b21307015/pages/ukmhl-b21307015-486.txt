456 ARTICULATIONS OF THE PELVIS. 3d. Betiveen the Sacrum and Coccyx. Sacro-coccygean anterior, Sacro-coccygean posterior. 4 th. Between the Ossa Pubis. Anterior pubic, Posterior pubic, Superior pubic, Sub-pubic, Inter-articular fibro-cartilage. 1. The Anterior sacro-iliac ligament consists of short ligamentous fibres, passing from bone to bone on the anterior surface of the joint. The Posterior sacro-iliac ligament is composed of stronger fasciculi, passing in the same direction on the posterior aspect of the joint. One of these, longer and larger than the rest, is distinguished by the name of the oblique sacro- iliac ligament. It is attached by one extremity to the posterior superior spine of the ilium ; and by the other, to the posterior surface of the third piece of the sacrum. The Interosseous ligament consists of a number of strong ligamentous fibres, which pass horizontally between the two rough surfaces, on the posterior half of the sacro-iliac articulation. This ligament is the principal bond of con- nection between the sacrum and the ilium. The surfaces of the two bones forming the sacro-iliac articulation, are partly covered by cartilage, and partly rough and connected by the interosseous ligament. The anterior half is coated with cartilage, which is thicker on the sacrum than the ilium. The surface of the cartilage is irregular, and is provided with a very delicate synovial membrane, which cannot be demonstrated in the adult; but is apparent in the young subject, and in the female during pregnancy. 2. Betiveen the sacrum and ischium. â€” The Anterior sacro-ischiatic ligament is triangular in its form ; it is attached by its apex to the spine of the ischium, and by its broad extremity to the side of the sacrum and coccyx. The Posterior sacro ischiatic ligament, considerably larger and more posterior than the preceding, is narrower in the

ANTERIOR BRACHIAL REGION. — MUSCLES. 81 e 5 tention were needed, he should recollect that every man is a judge of so common a proceeding; and that this operation well performed has elevated a surgeon to a ba- ronetcy. Anterior Brachial Region. The Deep fascia of the upper arm may now be dissected back ; this will bring into view the muscles of the anterior brachial region: these are the Coraco-brachialis, Biceps, Brachialis anticus. The Coraco-brachialis, a name composed of its points of origin and insertion, arises from the coracoid process in com- mon with the short head of the biceps, and is inserted into a rough line on the inner side of the middle of the humerus. The Biceps (bi — KsipaXvj, two heads) arises by two ten- dons, one the short head from the coracoid process in common with the coraco-brachialis ; the other the long head, from the upper part of the glenoid cavity. The muscle is inserted by a rounded tendon into the tubercle of the radius. The long head, a long slender tendon passes through the capsular ligament of the shoulder-joint enclosed in a sheath of the synovial membrane ; after leaving the cavity of the joint it is lodged in the deep groove that separates the two tuberosities of the humerus, the bicipital groove. A small synovial bursa is interposed between the tendon of insertion, and the tubercle of the radius. At the bend of the elbow, the tendon of the biceps gives off from its inner side a narrow tendinous band {fig. 8. 13.), which protects the brachial artery, and is con- tinuous with the fascia of the fore-arm. The Brachialis anticus muscle arises by two fleshy ser- rations from the depressions on either side of the inser- tion of the deltoid, and from the anterior surface of the humerus. Its fibres converge to be inserted into the coro- noid process of the ulna. Posterior Thoracic Region. — First Layer. Trapezius, Latissimus dorsi. If the subject be turned upon its face, the posterior

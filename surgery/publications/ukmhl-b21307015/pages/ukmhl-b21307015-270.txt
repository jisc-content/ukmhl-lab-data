240 CIRCLE OF WILLIS. upon to answer how this circle was formed, we should say by the anterior communicating, anterior cerebral arteries, and internal carotids ; posterior communicating, posterior cerebrals, and basilar artery. The Circle of Willis includes within its area, several parts of the base of the brain, which should also be attended to. They may probably be more advantageously explained in a diagram, thus : — Anterior communicating. xv Internal carotid. Commissure of the optic nerves. Tuber cinereum. Infundibulum. Internal carotid.

The Encephalon (tv KefaXt], within the head,) or contents of the skull, are the cerebrum, cere- bellum, medulla oblongata, and membranes. To form a just conception of these structures, it is necessary that the principle of development should be briefly explained. Development of Cerebro-spinal Axis in Animals. The centre of the nervous system in the lowest animals possessed of a lengthened axis, presents itself in the form of a double cord. A step higher in the animal scale, and knots or ganglia are developed upon one extremity of this cord; such is the most rudimentary condition of the brain in the lowest forms of vertebrata. In the lowest fishes the anterior extremity of the double cord displays a suc- cession of five pairs of ganglia. The higher fishes and

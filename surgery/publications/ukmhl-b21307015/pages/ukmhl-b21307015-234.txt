CERVICAL NERVES. 204 Inferior, communicating with the third cervical gan- glion. External, communicating with the third, fourth, and fifth cervical nerves. Internal, a large branch which descends to the heart; the Middle cardiac nerve (n. cardiacus magnus). The Inferior cervical ganglion, of a semilunar form, is situated immediately behind the vertebral artery, sup- ported by the transverse process of the seventh cervical vertebra. Branchesâ€”Superior, to communicate with the second cervical ganglion. Inferior, to communicate with the first dorsal ganglion. External, to communicate with the fifth, sixth, and seventh cervical nerves; and one or two small filaments which ascend along the vertebral artery. Internal, several branches to communicate with the recurrent nerve ; and a branch to the heart, the Inferior cardiac nerve. The cardiac nerves are very irregular, both in origin and course: they cross the innominata artery on the right, and the left carotid on the left side, and pass in front of the trachea to the base of the heart. The Cervical nerves are eight in number, and increase in size from above downwards. The first (sub-occipital) passes out of the spinal canal between the occipital bone and the atlas ; the last, between the last cervical and first dorsal vertebrae. Each nerve, at its escape from the intervertebral foramen, divides into an anterior and pos- terior branch. The anterior branches of the four upper cervical nerves form the cervical plexus; the posterior branches, the posterior cervical plexus. The anterior branches of the four inferior cervical and first dorsal form the brachial plexus. The Cervical plexus is formed by loops of communi- cation which pass from one nerve to another: the com- municating branch between the first and second nerves is very small ; the others have several communicating branches which are larger in size. The plexus rests upon the levator anguli scapulas and posterior scalenus muscles.

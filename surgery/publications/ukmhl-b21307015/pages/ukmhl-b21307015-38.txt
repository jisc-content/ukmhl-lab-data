SURGICAL OBSERVATIONS. 8 of the component parts of the limb which he is about to study. The thigh may be dislocated at the hip, or at the knee; the muscles, or their tendons, may be ruptured; the arteries may be wounded or diseased, requiring that incisions of considerable extent or depth should be made in their course, and a ligature placed around them ; or nerves may be ganglionated, and demand removal; lastly, the whole limb may be disorganised, and call for ampu- tation. In each and every of these circumstances, relief is simply and effectually bestowed, if the operator be well acquainted with the situation and dissection of the various structures which may be implicated in the accident or disease ; and these are to be learnt only in the dissecting room by careful observation and manipulation. Having the lower extremity extended on the table before him, and the leg everted, let the student carry aline (Jig.l. l.) from the extreme point of the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium to the symphisis pubis, and then an- other, 2. from the middle of the preceding to that projection upon the inner condyle of the femur, which gives attachment to the internal lateral ligament of the knee-joint; this will mark the course of the femoral artery. If the leg be perfectly straight, without inversion or eversion, the line must be carried to the apex of the patella. Again, if a line, 3., be drawn from the spinous pro- * Fig. 1.

NERVES OF THE FORE-ARM. 101 buted to the anterior and posterior aspects of the wrist joint. The posterior is the largest. r ■ The Digital branches supply the collateral branches to the little, ring, and middle fingers, and the ulnar side of the index finger. The Superficial palmar arch receives the termination of the deep arch, near to the carpal extremity of the little finger, and terminates in the superficialis volae, upon the ball of the thumb. Nerves of the Fore-arm. The Nerves of the fore-arm are the cutaneous, the median, ulnar, radial, and posterior interosseous. The cutaneous nerves, derived from the external cutaneous, internal cutaneous, and spiral cutaneous, have been already described (see pages 77, 78.) Median Nerve. The Median nerve runs down the anterior aspect of the fore-arm, from the bend of the elbow to the hand, where it divides into its five terminal branches. Relations — At the bend of the elbow, it passes between the two heads of the pronator radii teres and flexor sublimis digitorum muscles. In the fore-arm, it lies between the flexor sublimis and profundus, and at the wrist it passes with the tendons of these two muscles beneath the annular ligament into the palm of the hand. Branches. — The branches of the median nerve may be arranged in two groups, there being none given off in the upper arm. Fore, arm Hand { { Muscular. Anterior interosseous. Superficial palmar. Five digital. The Muscular l/ranches are distributed to the muscles on the anterior aspect of the fore-arm. The Anterior interosseous is a large branch, accompany- ing the anterior interosseous artery, and supplying the f 3

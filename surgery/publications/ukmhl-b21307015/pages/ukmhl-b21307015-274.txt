CORPUS CALLOSUM. 244 substance presented to the view on the removal of the upper part of each hemisphere ; it is surrounded by the thin stratum of grey substance, which follows in a zigzag line all the convolutions and the fissures between them. In the middle of the centrum ovale majus is the broad band which connects the two hemispheres to each other, the corpus callosum. The Corpus callosum (fig. 24. 1.1. jig. 25. l.) (callosus, hard) is a dense layer of transverse fibres, connecting the two hemispheres, and approaching nearer to the anterior than to the posterior extremity of the brain. Anteriorly it forms a rounded border {jig. 25. 2.), and maybe traced downwards to the base of the brain, in front of the com- missure of the optic nerves. Posteriorly it forms a thick rounded fold {jig. 25. 3.), which is continuous with the fornix. Beneath the posterior rounded border of the corpus Fig. 24.* * Fig. 24. A diagram, representing a transverse section of the brain. . Nos. 1. 1. The corpus callosum, or great commissure of the hemi- spheres, extending transversely into each hemisphere. 2. The raplid, a linear depression between two slightly elevated ridges. 3. S. The lateral ventricles. 4. The space between the two layers of the septum lucidum, called the fifth ventricle. 5. 5. The fornix. 6. 6. The thin edges of the fornix, called corpora fimbriata. 7. The velum in- terpositum. 8. 8. The plexiform borders of the velum interpositum, called choroid plexuses. 9. 9. The thalami optici. 10. The space between the two thalami, called third ventricle. 11. The grey com- missure of the thalami optici, called middle commissure, or commis- sura mollis of the third ventricle. 12. The line of the base of the brain.

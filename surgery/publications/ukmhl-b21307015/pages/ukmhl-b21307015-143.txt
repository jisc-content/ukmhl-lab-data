113 CHAPTER III. THORAX. The Thorax is the conical cavity situated at the upper part of the trunk which contains the chief organs of respiration and circulation. Dissection. â€” Its dissection consists in dividing the ribs on each side from the second to the fifth, and removing the anterior wall of the chest by separating its muscular connections, and sawing across the sternum. The Boundaries of the chest are the ribs, intercostal muscles, vertebral column, and sternum, which form its cir- cumference. The first rib, and thoracic fascia above, and the diaphragm below. It is much deeper on the posterior than on the anterior wall, in consequence of the obliquity of the diaphragm. The Muscles of the chest are the intercostals and trian- gularis sterni. The intercostals consist of muscular and tendinous fibres, which are directed obliquely between the ribs. They are disposed in two planes, the external and in- ternal, and cross each other in the direction of their fibres. The jExternal intercostals, eleven on each side, com- mence posteriorly at the vertebral column, and advance forwards to within a few inches of the sternum, becoming gradually thin and aponeurotic. Their fibres are directed obliquely downwards and inwards, pursuing the same line with those of the external oblique muscle of the abdomen. The Internal intercostals, eleven on each side, com- mence anteriorly at the sternum, and extend backwards to within a short distance of the vertebral column. Their fibres are directed obliquely downwards and backwards, and correspond in direction with those of the internal oblique muscle of the abdomen. Ihe intercostal vessels and nerves pursue their course between the two planes of muscles.

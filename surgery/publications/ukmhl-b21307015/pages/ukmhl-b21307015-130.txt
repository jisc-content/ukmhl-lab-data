ULNAR ARTERY. BRANCHES. 100 deep fascia, the sheath of the vessels, and, at the wrist, the palmaris brevis muscle and tendinous band. In wounds of arteries, wherever they occur, both extremities of the vessel are to be tied ; and this is the rule of practice for wounds in the palm of the hand. The Branches of the Ulnar artery may be arranged into four groups : — Elbow J Anterior ulnar recurrent. (_ Posterior ulnar recurrent. Fore-arm { Interosseous Muscular. f Ant. inteross. Post, inteross. — recurrent. Wrist Hand {Carpalis anterior. Carpalis posterior. Digitales, four. The Anterior ulnar recurrent returns upon the elbow, between the pronator teres and brachialis anticus and inosculates with the anastomotica magna. The Posterior ulnar recurrent returns upon the elbow, by passing beneath the origins of the superficial layer of muscles, and then between the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris. It inosculates with the inferior profunda and anastomotica magna. The Common interosseous is a short trunk, which divides into the anterior and posterior interosseous arteries. The Anterior interosseous runs down the fore-arm upon the interosseous membrane, and at the upper border of the pronator quadratus pierces that membrane, and de- scends to the back of the wrist, where it inosculates with the posterior carpal branches of the radial and ulnar. The Posterior interosseous artery passes back through an opening between the upper part of the interosseous membrane and the oblique ligament, and is distributed to the muscles on the posterior aspect of the fore-arm. It gives off a recurrent branch, which returns upon the elbow beneath the anconeus muscle, and anastomoses with the posterior articular branch of the superior profunda. The Muscular branches supply the muscles situated on the ulnar border of the fore-arm. The Carpal branches, anterior and posterior, are distri-

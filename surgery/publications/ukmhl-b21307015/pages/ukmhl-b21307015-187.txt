ARRANGEMENT INTO GROUPS. 157 and form so many regions, by which the muscles may be grouped and arranged. Thus we find the, 1. Superficial group. 2. Depressors of the os hyoides and larynx. 3. Elevators of the os hyoides and larynx. 4. Lingual group. 5. Soft palate group. 6. Pharyngeal group. 7. Prevertebral group. 8. Proper muscles of the larynx. These eight groups therefore, will form so many dis- tinct ideas, by which the composition of the neck and the arrangement of its muscles may be associated in the mind. To facilitate still more the learning of these mus- cles, the student is informed, that with the exception of the two first, each group consists of five muscles. This is better shown in the following table : â€” 1. Superficial group. Platysma myoides, Sterno-cleido-mastoideus. 2. Depressors of the os hyoides and larynx. Sterno-hyoideus, Sterno-thyroideus, Thyro -hyoideus, Omo-hyoideus. 3. Elevators of the os hyoides and larynx. Digastricus, Stylo-hyoideus, Mylo-hyoideus, Genio-hyoideus, Genio-hyo-glossus. 4. Muscles of the tongue. Genio-hyo-glossus, Plyo-glossus, Lingualis, Stylo-glossus, Palato-glossus. 5. Muscles of the soft palate. Levator palati, Tensor palati, Azygos uvulae, Palato-glossus, Palato-pharyngeus. 6. Muscles of the pharynx. Constrictor inferior, Constrictor medius, Constrictor superior, Stylo-pharyngeus, Palato-pharyngeus. 7. Prevertebral group. Rectus anticus major, Rectus anticus minor, Scalenus anticus, Scalenus posticus, Longus colli.

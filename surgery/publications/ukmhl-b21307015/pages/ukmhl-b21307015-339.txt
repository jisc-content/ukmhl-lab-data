309 PAPILLARY LAYER. CORIUM. The Coriurn [fig. 36. l.) is the base of support to the skin, and owes its density of structure to an interlace- ment of fibrous bands which form a firm and elastic web. Fix. 36.* On its under surface it presents a number of areolae, in which are lodged cells of adipose tissue. It is connected by this surface with the general superficial fascia of the body. On the upper surface, the fibres are more closely ag- gregated, and form a smooth plane for the support of the papillary layer. The corium differs very much in thickness in different parts of the body; thus, on the lips, eyelids, and scrotum, it is extremely thin. On the head, back, soles of the feet, and palms of the hands, it is very thick, and on the more exposed parts of the body it is much thicker than on those which are protected. The Papillary layer (fig. 36. 2.) is soft, and formed by minute papillae which cover every part of its surface. On the body generally, the papillae are irregular in their form and distribution : they are best seen in the palm of the hand or sole of the foot, where they are distributed in linear ridges, as is indicated by the linear markings on the cuticle. In these situations each papilla resembles a molar tooth, having four tubercles, one of them being generally longer than the others. Between each of the papillae is the open- ing for the perspiratory duct. The papillae beneath the nail have a peculiar arrange- ment and structure. At the root of the nail the papillae * Fig. 36.

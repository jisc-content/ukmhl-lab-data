234- lateral SINUSES. inner wall of the vein is enabled to perform the office of a valve, and prevent the reflux of the blood into the veins in an over-distended condition of the sinus. The Inferior longitudinal sinus is much smaller than the superior. It is circular in its form, and contained within the free margin of the falx cerebri. It terminates posteriorly in the straight sinus at the anterior border of the tentorium. The Straight sinus (fourth,) is the sinus of the tento- rium. It receives the venae Galeni * from the velum in- terposition, and runs backwards along the arch of the tentorium to the termination of the superior longitudinal sinus. The Occipital sinus is a small venous channel, which collects its blood from around the foramen magnum, and ascends along the fixed border of the falx cerebelli, to terminate in the torcular Herophili. The Lateral sinuses, starting from the termination of the superior longitudinal, curve around the occipital bone in the fixed border of the tentorium, and descend on each side behind the base of the petrous bone to the foramen lacerum posterius, where they pour their current into the internal jugular vein. These sinuses rest successively on the occipital bone, posterior inferior angles of the parietal, temporal, and occipital bones. The point of termination of the superior longitudinal sinus is therefore the centre of convergence of the straight and occipital sinuses, and the starting point of the lateral sinuses. Hence it is named the conflux of the sinuses or torcular Herophilif The sinuses of the base of the skull are, the Cavernous, Inferior petrosal, Circular, Superior petrosal, Transverse. The Cavernous sinuses are so named from presenting a cellular structure in their interior.

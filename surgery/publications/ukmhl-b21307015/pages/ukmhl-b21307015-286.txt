BASE OF THE BRAIN. 256 The Corpora restiformia, or inferior peduncles, diverge at the upper extremity of the medulla oblongata, and enter the cerebellum, forming, by their divergence, part of the lateral boundaries of the fourth ventricle. Their fibres surround the corpus rhomboideum, and are ex- panded into the lamellae of the cerebellum. The Processus e cerebello ad testes are the superior pe- duncles : they ascend from the corpus rhomboideum on each side to the testis, and also form part of the lateral boundaries of tbe fourth ventricle. The valve of Vieus- sens, by connecting the two processus h cerebello ad testes from side to side, and the cerebellum and testes from behind forwards, also contributes to the antero-pos- terior communication. The Crura cerebelli are the terminations of the trans- verse fibres of the pons Varolii, or great commissure of the cerebellum, which serves to estabish a transverse communication between the lateral lobes. Base of the Brain. The student should now prepare to study the base of the brain ; for this purpose it should be turned upon its incised surface, and if the dissection have hitherto been conducted with care, he will find the base perfectly un- injured. The arachnoid membrane, some parts of the pia mater, and the circle of Willis, must be carefully cleaned away in order to expose all the structures. These he will find arranged in the following order from before backwards: â€” Longitudinal fissure, Olfactory nerves, Fissure of Sylvius, Substantia perforata, Commencement of the transverse fissure, Optic commissure, Tuber cinereum, Infundibulum, Corpora albicantia, Locus perforatus, Crura cerebri, Pons Varolii, Crura cerebelli, Medulla oblongata.

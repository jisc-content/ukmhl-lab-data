345 FOLLICLES. — GLANDS. In the loose cellular tissue connecting the mucous with the fibrous layer, are situated the four kinds of mucous glands belonging to the mucous membrane: these are Simple follicles (Lieberkuhn’s), Glandulas solitariae, Glandulae aggregate (Peyer’s), Duodenal glands (Brunner’s). The Simple follicles, or follicles of Lieberkuhn, are small pouches of the mucous layer, situated in immense numbers in every part of the membrane. The Solitary glands are very generally called Brun- ner’s, but erroneously ; for that anatomist confined his description to those situated in the duodenum: we have, therefore, attached his name only to the latter. The solitary glands are found in the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine ; but are most numerous in the ccecum. They are small flattened granular bodies, without any apparent opening upon the surface of the membrane. The Aggregate, or Peyer’s# glands, are principally situated near to the lower end of the ileum, and occupy that portion of the intestine which is opposite the attach- ment of the mesentery. They present the appearance of oval patches, covered with small irregular fissures, which separate the secreting lobules. The Duodenal, or Brunner s\ glands, are small flat- tened granular bodies, compared collectively by Von Brunn to a second pancreas. They resemble in structure the small salivary glands so abundant beneath the mucous membrane of the mouth and lips; and, like them, they open upon the surface by minute secretory ducts. Besides the mucous follicles and glands, there are a considerable number of small lengthened follicles em- bedded in the mucous membrane of the stomach, which secrete the gastric juice — the gastric follicles. * John Conrad Peyer, an anatomist of Schaffhausen, in Switzer- land.

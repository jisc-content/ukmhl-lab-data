105 MUSCLES. — SUPERFICIAL LAYER. f 5 Posterior aspect. — Superficial Layer : Supinator longus, Extensor carpi radialis longior, carpi radialis brevior, communis digitorum, minimi digiti, carpi ulnaris, Anconeus. The Supinator longus muscle is placed along the radial border of the fore-arm. It arises from the external con- dyloid ridge of the humerus, nearly as high as the inser- tion of the deltoid, and is inserted into the base of the styloid process of the radius. This muscle must be divided through the middle, and the two ends turned to either side to expose the next muscle. rThe Extensor carpi radialis longior arises from the external condyloid ridge below the preceding. Its tendon passes through a groove in the radius, immediately behind the styloid process, to be inserted into the base of the metacarpal bone of the index finger. The Extensor carpi radialis brevior is seen by drawing aside the former muscle. It arises from the external condyle of the humerus, and is inserted into the base of the metacarpal bone of the middle finger. Its tendon is lodged in the same groove of the radius with the extensor carpi radialis longior. The Extensor communis digitorum arises from the ex- ternal condyle, and divides into four tendons, which are inserted into the second and third phalanges of the fingers. The same peculiarities exist in the arrangement of these tendons as was before noticed in the extensor tendons of the foot. Opposite the first phalanx, the tendon {Jig. 9. 2.) spreads out so as to form a broad aponeurosis, which covers the whole of the posterior aspect of the finger. At the first joint the aponeurosis divides into three slips. The middle slip, 3., is inserted into the base of the second phalanx, and the two lateral portions are continued on- wards on each side of the joint, to be inserted into the last phalanx, 4. Little oblique tendinous slips connect the ten- dons of this muscle as they cross the back of the hand.

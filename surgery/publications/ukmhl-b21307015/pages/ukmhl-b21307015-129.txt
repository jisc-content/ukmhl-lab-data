99 ULNAR ARTERY. — RELATIONS. ulnar side of the fore-arm to the wrist, crosses the annular ligament, and forms the superficial palmar arch, which ter- minates by inosculating with the superficialis volae. Relations. — In the upper or oblique portion of its course, it lies between the superficial and deep layers of muscles of the fore-arm. In the second part of its course, it is placed between the flexor carpi ulnaris, and flexor sub- limis digitorum. While crossing the annular ligament, it is protected from injury by a strong tendinous arch, thrown over it from the pisiform bone; and in the palm it rests upon the tendons of the flexor sublimis, being covered in by the palmar fascia. Plan of the relations of the ulnar artery. In Front. Superficial layer of muscles. Deep fascia. In the Hand. Tendinous arch from the pisiform bone. Palmaris brevis muscle. Palmar fascia. Inner Side. Flexor carpi ulnaris. Ulnar nerve (lower two thirds). Deep layer of muscles. Flexor profundus digitorum. In the Hand. Annular ligament. Tendons of the flexor sublimis digitorum. Operations. — The ulnar artery is usually tied in three situations : — 1st. At the commencement of the middle third of the fore-arm, where it emerges from beneath the flexor sublimis. 2d. In the lower third. 3d. As it crosses the annular ligament. In the two first operations the border of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle is the guide for the incision, in the latter the pisiform bone. The high operation is the most difficult, on account of the depth of the artery and the danger of separating the wrong muscles. The lower operations are simple and easy, the artery lying quite superficially. The ulna nerve lies immediately to the ulnar side of the artery from the com- mencement of the middle third to the wrist, and therefore is not en- dangered in the upper operation. The venae comites are at each side. The structures to be cut through are the integument, superficial fascia, F 2 ILLCl Ott(o» Flexor sublimis digito- rum.

DESCENT OE THE TESTICLE. 44.5 canal, at this period, is occupied by a cellular cord of considerable thickness, called the giibernaculurn testis. The cells of this structure appear to be filled with a gelatinous fluid; and its use would seem to be to keep the spermatic canal properly dilated, and to direct and precede the testicle in its course downwards. The upper extremity of the gubernaculum is attached to the pos- terior border of the testicle, and its lower end is con- nected with the cellular interior of the scrotum. The Descent of the testicle is very gradual and pro- gressive. Between the fifth and sixth month it has reached the lower part of the psoas muscle, and during the seventh it makes its way through the spermatic canal, and is drawn onwards by the gubernaculum. While situated in the lumbar region it is behind the peritoneum, and is covered on its anterior surface and sides by that membrane, which constitutes its proper serous covering, the tunica vaginalis propria. As it de- scends into the scrotum it carries with it its investing peritoneum, and thus forms a pouch of serous membrane, which communicates with the cavity of the peritoneum. This pouch being constricted by the spermatic canal, be- comes gradually closed from above downwards, until it leaves only a small bag which surrounds the testicle, and forms the tunica vaginalis rejlexa. If the pouch do not immediately close, fluid collects within it, and may be pressed upwards into the cavity of the peritoneum ; this is congenital hydrocele. At other times the intestine descends into the pouch, and gives rise to the formation of congenital hernia. See fig. 41.

221 SYMPATHETIC — CRANIAL GANGLIA. L 3 The Auricular nerve (Jig- 22. 24.) passes directly backwards behind the articulation of the lower jaw, against which it rests. In this situation it divides into two branches, which reunite, and form a kind of plexus. From the plexus two branches are given off— one, 25., to communicate with the facial nerve in the parotid gland. The other, or temporal branch, ascends upon the root of the zigoma in front of the external ear, and is distributed to the pinna, the meatus, and the integument of the temple. It is pressure upon this nerve, which produces the agony of pain in abscess in the meatus. Cranial Ganglia of the Sympathetic. Six sympathetic ganglia are described as existing in the head: thev are, the Ganglion of Ribes, Ciliary ganglion, Spheno-palatine, or Meckel’s, Naso-palatine, or Cloquet’s, Otic, or Arnold’s, Submaxillary ganglion. The Ganglion of Ribes is a small ganglion of commu- nication between the sympathetic filaments of the anterior cerebral arteries. It is situated on the anterior commu- nicating artery. The remaining five ganglia are situated in relation with the fifth nerve and its branches. Thus, The Ciliary ganglion communicates with the nasal Dranch of the ophthalmic nerve. The Spheno-palatine is the sympathetic ganglion of the ;uperior maxillary nerve. 1 he Naso-palatine ganglion (if it exist) is a dependence >n the spheno-palatine. The Otic ganglion is situated on the internal pterygoid lerve, in relation with the motor root of the inferior naxillary nerve. The Submaxillary ganglion communicates with the gustatory nerve. W e shall describe them here *, in the order in which * ^ rnore rninute description of these ganglia, with an engraving, /ill be found in the Chapter (i On the Sympathetic Nerve.n

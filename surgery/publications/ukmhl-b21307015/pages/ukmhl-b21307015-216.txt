186 INTERNAL MAXILLARY ARTERY. Deep temporal branches, External pterygoid, Internal pterygoid, Masseteric, Buccal. Superior dental, 11., Infra-orbital, 12., Pterygo-palatine, 15., Spheno-palatine, 14., Posterior palatine, 13., Vidian, 16. Maxillary portion (Jiff- 16. 4.) — The Tympanic branch, 7., is very small and not likely to be seen in an ordinary dissection ; it passes into the tympanum through the fissura Glaseri. The Inferior dental, 10., descends to the dental foramen, and enters the canal of the lower jaw in company with the dental nerve. At the chin it escapes with the nerve from the mental foramen, and anastomoses with the in- ferior labial and submental branches of the facial. It supplies the teeth of the lower jaw, sending small branches along the canals in their roots. The Arteria meningea media, 8., is the great artery of the dura mater. It passes between the roots of the dental nerve, and through the foramen spinosum in the spinous process of the sphenoid, to the deep groove at the anterior inferior angle of the parietal bone. It divides into several branches, which ramify upon the external surface of the dura mater, and anastomose with corre- sponding branches from the opposite side. The Meningea parva, 9., is a small branch which ascends to the foramen ovale, and passes into the skull to be distributed to the dura mater. Muscular portion (Jig. 16. 5.).— The distribution of the muscular branches is implied in their names, sup- plying the five muscles of the temporo-maxillary region. Pterygo-maxillary portion (Jig- 16. c.)— The branches of this portion of the artery cannot be seen at the present stage of the preparation; they must be left until the dissection has proceeded more deeply. The Superior dental branch, it., is given off from the Muscular portion (Jig. 16. 5.) Pterygo-maxillary portion (fig. 16.- 6.)

227 l 6 SOFT PALATE. which is continued into two projecting pillars or half arches that are continuous below with the sides of the base of the tongue and pharynx. Between the projecting pillars is a niche lodging the tonsil. Fauces. â€” The boundaries of the fauces are the soft palate above the tongue below, and on either side these two jnllars of the soft palate, with the intervening tonsil. The Muscles of the soft palate are Azygos uvulae, Levator palati, Tensor palati, Palato-glossus, Palato-pharyngeus. If the mucous membrane be carefully raised from off the soft palate, these muscles will be brought distinctly into view. The Azygos uvulce is not a single muscle, as might be inferred from its name, but a pair of small muscles placed side by side in the middle line of the soft palate. They arise from the spine of the palate bone, and are inserted into the uvula. The Levator palati arises from the extremity of the petrous bone and Eustachian tube, and spreads out in the structure of the soft palate. This muscle must be turned down from its origin on one side, and removed, and the superior constrictor dissected away from its pterygoid origin, to bring the next muscle into view. The Tensor palati (circumflexus) arises from the sca- phoid fossa at the base of the internal pterygoid plate and from the Eustachian tube, and descends to the hamular process around which it turns, and expands into a ten- dinous aponeurosis, which is inserted into the transverse ridge on the palate plate of the palate bone, and into the raphe. The tensor palati is separated from the levator by the Eustachian tube and pterygoid origin of the su- perior constrictor. These three muscles are placed in the reverse order of their description from before backwards ; the tensor palati being the most anterior, next the levator palati, and then the azygos uvulae.

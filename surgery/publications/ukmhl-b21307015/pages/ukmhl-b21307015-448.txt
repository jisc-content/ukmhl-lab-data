SYMPATHETIC CRANIAL GANGLIA. 418 above; inferior or descending, to communicate with the ganglion below ; external, to communicate with the spinal nerves; and internal, to communicate with the sympathetic filaments of the opposite side, and to he distributed .to the viscera. Cranial Ganglia. Ganglion of Ribes, Ciliary, or lenticular ganglion, Naso-palatine, or Cloquet’s ganglion, Spheno-palatine, or Meckel’s ganglion, Submaxillai-y ganglion, Otic, or Arnold’s ganglion. 1. The Ganglion of Ribes {fig. 49. l.) is a small gan- glion situated upon the anterior communicating artery,and formed by the union of the sympathetic filaments, 2., which accompany the ramifications of the two anterior cerebral arteries. These filaments are derived from the carotid plexus at each side; and, through their intervention, the ganglion of Ribes is brought in connection with the carotid plexus, 3., and with the other ganglia of the sympathetic. This ganglion, though of very small size, is interesting, as being the superior point of union between the sympathetic chains of opposite sides of the body. 2. The Ciliary ganglion (lenticular) {fig. 49. A. fig. 21. 22.) is a small quadrangular flattened ganglion situated within the orbit, between the optic nerve and the external rectus : it is in close contact with the optic nerve, and is surrounded by a quantity of fat, which renders its dis- section difficult. Its Branches of distribution are the ciliary, which arise from its anterior angles by two groups ; the upper group, consisting of about four filaments; and the lower, of five or six. They accompany the ciliary arteries in a waving course, and divide into a number of branches pre- viously to piercing the sclerotic around the optic nerve: they supply the tunics of the eye. A small filament is said, by Tiedemann, to accompany the arteria centralis retinae into the globe of the eye. Its Branches of communication are three: 1. from the posterior superior angle to the nasal branch, 6., of the

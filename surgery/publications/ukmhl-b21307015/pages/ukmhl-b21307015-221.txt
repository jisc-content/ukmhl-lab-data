COURSE. RELATIONS. 191 nev border of the scalenus anticus. On the left side, 10., it ascends perpendicularly to the inner border of the scalenus anticus; the remainder of the course of the artery is the same on both sides. The Second portion, 6. ll., passes transversely outwards between the two scaleni. The Third portion, 7.12., downwards and outwards over the first rib. The relations of the first portion are best seen in the accompanying plan. Right Side (oblique). Infront. Parallel. Vena innominata. Crossing it. Pneumogastric nerve. Cardiac nerves. Phrenic nerve. Behind. Crossing. Recurrent laryngeal nerve. Left Side (perpendicular). In front. Pleura. Parallel. Pneumogastric nerve. Cardiac nerves. Phrenic nerve. Crossing. Vena innominata. Behind. Pleura. Parallel. Thoracic duct. From the superficial and deep position of the two ar- teries, the right lies in front of the pleura which covers its posterior surface, whilst the left is situated near the vertebral column, behind the pleura. The innominata vein is in front of the artery on both sides, lying parallel to it on the right, and crossing it at the upper part on the left. In consequence of the oblique direction of the artery on the right side, it is crossed by the pneumogastric, 13., :ardiac, and phrenic nerves, and the recurrent winds iround it, whilst on the left side they all run parallel vith it. The thoracic duct is placed immediately behind md parallel with the first portion of the artery on the eft side. The Second portion of the artery is situated between ncumogastric nerve, giving off the recurrent* around the subclavian rtery. 14. The left pneumogastric, sending its recurrent branch * round the arch of the aorta. * * The two recurrent laryngeal erves.

168 EXTERNAL JUGULAR VEIN. border of the masseter to join the artery, as it crosses the border of the jaw, is the facial vein. The Integument, which has already been partly removed from the neck, may now be dissected back altogether, bounding it by an incision made along the line of the clavicle. The superficial fascia is next to be removed, and with it the platysma myoides, noting the direction in which its fibres run. The deep fascia is thus brought into view, extending from the border of the trapezius to the middle line on the front of the neck. In relation with this fascia on the side of the neck, are certain parts which demand the student’s especial attention: they are, — The external jugular vein, The ascending branches of the cervical plexus, viz.— Superficialis colli, Auricularis magnus, Occipitalis minor. Sterno-mastoid muscle. The external jugular vein lies upon the deep fascia. The nerves lie partly between the two layers of the deep fascia, and partly superficial to them. The muscle is between the two layers, being the cause of their separation. The External jugular vein (fig. 14*. 8.) is the superficial venous trunk of the neck ; it receives the returning blood from the exterior of the side of the head, being formed by the Temporal vein, Internal maxillary, Posterior auricular, and near to the clavicle is joined by cutaneous veins from the back of the neck. Immediately beneath the parotid gland it communicates with the internal jugular vein. . .... Course. — Emerging from the parotid gland in which it lies imbedded, it descends somewhat obliquely along the side of the neck, and behind the clavicle to the sub- clavian vein. Relations. — It lies upon the sheath of the sterno-

The Pliaiynx is situated behind the mouth, and ex- tends from the base of the skull to the fifth cervical vertebra. The (Esophagus commences opposite the fifth cervical vertebra, and descends the neck, behind and rather to the left of the trachea. It then passes beneath the arch of the aorta, and along the posterior mediastinum in front of the thoracic aorta to the cesophagal opening in the diaphragm, where it enters the abdomen, and terminates at the cardiac orifice of the stomach. The Stomach is an expansion of the alimentary canal, situated in the left hypochondriac region, and extending into the epigastric. On account of the peculiarity of its form, it is divided into a greater, or splenic, and a lesser, or pyloric end, a lesser curvature above, and a greater curvature below, a cardiac orifice and a pyloric orifice. The Great end is not only of large size, but expands beyond the point of entrance of the oesophagus. The pylorus is the small and contracted extremity of the organ. The two Curvatures give attachment to the perito- neum ; the upper curve to the lesser omentum, and the lower to the greater omentum. I he Small intestines are divided into three portions, duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The JJuodenum (called SdySc/faSa/cTvXov by Herophilus) is named from being equal in length to the breadth of twelve fingers. Commencing at the pylorus it ascends obliquely to the under surface of the liver : it next de- scends perpendicidarly in front of the right kidney, and Q 3

402 CHAPTER X. ANATOMY OF THE PERINEUM. The Perineum is the inferior part of the trunk of the body in which are situated the two great excretory outlets, the urethra and the termination of the alimentary canal. These are parts of delicate and complicated structure, and largely supplied with vessels and nerves. They are also peculiarly liable, from the nature of their functions, to causes of irritation and disease. Indeed, disease is more frequent and various in this region, than in any other of the body. Nearly the whole of the affections admit of relief or cure from operative procedure. Hence the peri- neum is the most important surgical region of the entire system, and incisions are made through it to great depth and in various directions. A good knowledge of its com- ponent structures and relations is therefore highly ne- cessary to the Surgeon, for a misdirected incision, by wounding important parts, would involve the most serious consequences, and probably prove fatal to the patient. The anatomical composition of the perineum is the same as that of any other part of the body, consisting of integument, superficial fascia, deep fascia, muscles, vessels, and nerves. But to suit the peculiar functions of this region, they are somewhat differently distributed and ar- ranged. To obtain a clear and precise idea of the nature of the perineum, the student must take in his hand a pelvis in which the sacro-ischiatic ligaments have been left in their proper positions. Let him now turn to the outlet of the pelvis, and he will be enabled to trace the boundaries of the perineum. In front he will have the arch of the pubis, cm each side the ramus and tuberosity of the ischium and great sacro-ischiatic ligaments and behind the coccyx. If he draw a line transversely across this outlet from the anterior extremity of one tuberosity of the ischium to the same point on the other, he will divide the open- ing into two parts of nearly equal size. The anterior

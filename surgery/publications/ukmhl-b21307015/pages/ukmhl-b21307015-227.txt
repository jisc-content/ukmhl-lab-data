The Glosso-pharyngeal nerve presents agangliform swelling, the ganglion of Andersch +, jig. 19. 6. (gan- glion petrosum), upon that portion of its cylinder which is situated in the jugular fossa. It then passes forwards between the jugular vein and internal carotid artery, to the stylo-pharyngeus muscle, and descends along its in- ferior border to the hyo-glossus, beneath which it passes to be distributed to the mucous membrane of the tongue, and to the mucous glands of the mouth and tonsils. Its Branches may be thus arranged: — Communicating branches with the , . Facial, Pneumogastric, Spinal accessory, Sympathetic. Tympanic, Muscular, Pharyngeal. The Branches of communication are common to the facial, eighth pair, and sympathetic; they form a com- plicated plexus at the base of the skull. origin of the glosso-pharyngeal nerve. 6.

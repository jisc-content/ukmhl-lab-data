326 CREMASTER MUSCLE, from the lower border of the muscle, which ac- company the cord down- wards to the testicle, and form loops around it: this is the cremaster muscle. In the descent of oblique inguinal hernia, which travels the same course with the spermatic cord, the cremaster muscle forms one of its coverings. The Cremaster, consi- dered as a distinct muscle, arises from the middle of Poupart’s ligament, and forms a series of loops upon the spermatic cord. A few of its fibres are inserted into the tunica vaginalis, the rest ascend along the inner side of the cord, to be inserted,, with the conjoined ten- don, into the pectineal line of the pubis. A large nerve is seen piercing the lower fibres of the internal oblique muscle, and passing through the external abdominal ring with the spermatic cord, to which it is distributed ; this is the scrotal branch of the ilio-scrotal nerve (superior musculo-cutaneous). * Fig. 38. The internal oblique and transversalis muscles in the inguinal region, with the boundaries of the inguinal canal. No. 1. The internal oblique muscle. 2. A part of the transver- salis muscle seen by drawing down the internal oblique. 3. The lower arched border of the two muscles, forming the upper boundary of the canal. 4. Poupart’s ligament, forming the lower boundary of the canal. 5. The fascia transversalis. 6. The conjoined tendon of the internal oblique and transversalis descending behind Poupart’s liga- ment, to be inserted into the pectineal line. Numbers 5 and 6. form the posterior boundary of the canal, the anterior boundary being formed by the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle which is removed. 7. The internal abdominal ring, an opening in the transversalis fascia, the commencement of the canal. 8. A dark outline marking the situation of the external abdominal ring. The dotted lines between the two rings show the situation and course of the spermatic cord.

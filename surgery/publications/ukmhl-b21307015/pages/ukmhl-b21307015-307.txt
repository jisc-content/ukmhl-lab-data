277 NASAL FOSS®. membranous structure, permits of the freedom of motion existing between them. 5. The Mucous membrane, lining the interior of the nose, is continuous with the skin externally, and with the pituitary membrane of the nasal fossae within. Around the entrance of the nostrils it is provided with the vi- brissce. 6. Vessels and Nerves. — The arteries of the nose are the lateralis nasi from the facial, and the nasalis septi from the superior coronary. Its Nerves are the facial, infra-orbital, and nasal branch of the ophthalmic. Nasal Foss.®. To obtain a good view of the nasalfossce, the face must be divided through the nose by a vertical incision, a little to one side of the middle line. The Nasalfossce are two irregular, compressed cavities, extending backwards from the nose to the pharynx. They are bounded, superiorly, by the sphenoid and ethmoid bones, lnferiorly, by the hard palate, and in the middle line they are separated from each other by a bony septum. The boundaries of this cavity will be more simply expressed in a tabular form, thus: — Nasal bones. Cribriform plate of ethmoid. Sphenoid. - C3 V.

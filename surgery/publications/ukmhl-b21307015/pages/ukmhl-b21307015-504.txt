TARSAL LIGAMENTS. 4-74< The transverse ligament of the tibia and fibula occupies the place of a posterior ligament. The Synovial membrane invests the cartilaginous sur- faces of the tibia and fibula, sending a duplicature upwards between their lower ends and the upper surface and two sides of the astragalus. It is then reflected upon the anterior and lateral ligaments, and upon the transverse ligament posteriorly. Dislocations. — The dislocations occurring at this joint, are four in number: — 1. Tibia inwards, the foot being turned outwards. This is Pott’s dislocation, and in this case the deltoid ligament is ruptured, and the fibula fractured, at about three inches from its lower extremity. In a more severe case, a portion of the fibular side of the tibia is split off, and the broken end of the fibula rests upon the cartila- ginous surface of the astragalus. 2. Tibia outwards, the foot being turned inwards. In this case, which is the most serious of the accidents occurring to the ankle joint, the inner condyle of the tibia is fractured, the deltoid ligament remaining whole ; the fibula is splintered, and the astragalus is sometimes fractured. The external ligaments generally remain whole ; if the fibula be uninjured, they must be rup- tured, 3. Tibia forwards: this is a partial dislocation ; the tibia is thrown forwards so as to rest partly on the scaphoid bone ; and the fibula is fractured. 4. Both bones backwards: this is extremely rare ; there are not more than one or two cases on record. 5. Articulation of the Tarsal bones. — The ligaments which connect the seven bones of the tarsus to each other are of three kinds,— Dorsal, Plantar, Interosseous. The Dorsal ligame?its are small, flattened fasciculi, which pass from each bone to all the neighbouring bones with which it articulates. The Plantar ligaments have the same disposition on

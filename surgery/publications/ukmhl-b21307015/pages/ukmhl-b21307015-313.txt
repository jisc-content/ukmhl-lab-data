283 CHOROID COAT. of the iris by a gentle pressure with the edge of the knife. The dis- section of the eye must be conducted under water. In the course of this dissection the ciliary nei'ves and long ciliary arteries will be seen passing forwards between the sclerotic and choroid, to be distributed to the iris. 2. The Second tunic (fig. 30.) of the eye-ball is formed by the choroid and iris; the ciliary processes being an appendage developed from its inner surface. The Choroid \ (fig. 30. l., fig. 32. 4.) is a vascular membrane of a rich chocolate brown colour upon its external surface, and of a deep black colour within. It is : * Fig. 30.

A long ciliary artery and nerve. 4. The ciliary ligament. 5. The iris; the two sets of fibres are very distinctly seen, the external, radiating towards the centre, and the internal, circular, surrounding the pupil 6. f The word choroid has been very much abused in anatomical lan- guage ; it was originally applied to the membrane of the foetus called chorion, from the Greek word x°P10l,> domicilium, that membrane being, as it were, the abode or receptacle of the foetus. Xopiov comes from xuPeu> to take or receive. Now it so happens that the chorion in the ovum is a vascular membrane of a peculiar structure. Hence the termchoroid x°PiOV «<8or, like thechorion, has been used indiscriminately to signify vascular structures, as in the choroid membrane of the eye, the choroid plexus, &c., and we find Cruveilhier in his admirable work on Anatomy, vol. iii. p. 463., saying in a note, “ Choroide est synonyme de vasculeuse.”

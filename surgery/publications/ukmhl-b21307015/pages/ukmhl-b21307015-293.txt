Trifacial. 1st pair, Olfactory. — This nerve rests against the under surface of the anterior lobe of the brain, being lodged in the narrow interval between two convolutions, and retained in its place by the arachnoid membrane. It arises by three roots, 1. Internal, from the substantia perforata. 2. Middle, from a papilla of grey matter t embedded in the anterior lobe. 3. External, from a long root which is traced for a considerable distance along the fissure of Sylvius, into the middle lobe. The union of these roots forms a nerve, triangular in form, and soft in structure, which expands into a bulb (bvlbus olfactorius'), and rests upon the cribriform plate. Its branches are transmitted through the numerous foramina in the cribri- form plate, to be distributed to the mucous membrane of the nose. 2d pair, Optic. — The optic nerve {Jig. 26.) arises by ' two roots, — one, 8., from the corpus gcniculatum externum, I 6.; the other, 9., from the nates. It winds around the crus cerebri as a flattened band, and unites with its fellow of ! the opposite side to form the commissure, lo. The two [ nerves then diverge from each other, to enter the orbit through the optic foramen, pierce the sclerotic and choroid coats of the eyeball, and expand in the retina, 11. The commissure rests upon the processus olivaris of the sphenoid bone, and its posterior border is closely connected with the tuber cinereum. On entering the orbit, the nerve obtains a firm sheath from the dura mater, which is continuous with the sclerotic coat of the eyeball.

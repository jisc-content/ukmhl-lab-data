6 I/I G AMENTS.— JOINTS. objects sought for in the shaft of the bone, the extremities are expanded into broad surfaces, that they may transmit the weight of the body with perfect security to the bones below. In the formation of a joint a new organ is introduced, “the ligament” (ligare, to bind). It consists of short strata of fibres passing from bone to bone, in order to con- nect them together. The different varieties of joint demand a different arrangement of these ligaments. Thus the hinge joint, as the elbow, wrist, knee, ankle, moving in one direction only, has necessarily a squareness of form, and is provided with a ligament to each of its four sides. These are named from their position, anterior, posterior, and lateral. A great proportion of the joints of the body are constructed upon this simple principle. When more extensive movements are demanded, the ball and socket joint is provided, and to accommodate its circular form, the four ligaments are, as it were, united into one, which completely surrounds the ends of the two bones. Hence the capsular ligaments of the hip, the shoulder, and the thumb; and when repose and solidity are the great objects, as in the vertebral column, the pelvis, the carpus, and tarsus, small slips of ligaments are seen passing from bone to bone in every direction in which these straight bands can be arranged, without inconvenience to the general plan. These then are the structures of which, with the ex- ception of the viscera, the whole animal frame is com- posed ; and it is incumbent upon the student of anatomy to possess a clear and distinct idea of all these parts, their uses, and natural dependencies, before he can hope to display and examine them in the body with advantage.

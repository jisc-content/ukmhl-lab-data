25 CRURAL NERVE. genito-crural nerve, 5., forming the internal cutaneous nerve of the thigh, has also been de- scribed (page 13.) The Crural or femoral nerve, G., is the largest of the branches from the lumbar plexus. It is formed by the union of the second, third, and fourth lumbar nerves, passes beneath the outer border of the psoas magnus muscle, and runs downwards in the groove between that muscle and the iliacus internus to Pou- part’s ligament. It is there se- parated from the femoral artery by the breadth of the psoas muscle, usually not more than half an inch wide ; and imme- diately below Poupart’s liga- ment divides into three sets of branches: —Cutaneous— fig. 1. 13. fig. 2. 8. ; three or four in number which pierce the deep fascia to supply the integument, forming the middle cutaneous nerves on the forepart of the thigh. One or two of these will be seen to pass through the sar- torius muscle. Muscular—fig. 2. 7. distributed to the muscles on the forepart and outer side of the thigh : and Saphenous — fig. 2. 9.

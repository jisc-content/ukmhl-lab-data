265 MOTOR TRACT. 8., of the calamus scriptorius. It winds around the corpus restiforme, and enters the meatus auditorius interims, together with the facial nerve, which lies in a depression on its surface. At the bottom of the meatus it divides into two branches, which are distributed to the internal ear. It is extremely soft in its structure : hence its syno- nyme, portio mollis. The corpora pyramidalia are the continuations of the anterior columns of the spinal cord \ hence theii function is motion. The prolongation of these fasciculi through the pons Varolii into the crura cerebri is the motor tract, * Fi". 27. The origin and distribution of the auditory nerve. No. 1. The corpora quadrigemina. 2. 2. The processus e cere- l oello ad testes, at each side. 3. 3. The corpora restiformia. 4. The .pace included between these four bodies, the fourth ventricle. 5. The opening of the canal of communication which leads from the hird ventricle, the iter a tertio ad quartum ventriculum. 6. The :alamus scriptorius. 7. The posterior median columns of the spinal :ord, which form by their divergence the point of the calamus, which s also called the ventricle of Arantius. 8. The lines: transversae of he fourth ventricle, which are the lines of origin of the auditory rerve. 9. The anterior branch of the auditory nerve, distributed to he cochlea. 10. The posterior, or vestibular branch. 11. The itriculus communis, which conceals the sacculus proprius from view. 2. The ampulla of the oblique semicircular canal. 1 3. The ampullae f the perpendicular and horizontal semicircular canals. N

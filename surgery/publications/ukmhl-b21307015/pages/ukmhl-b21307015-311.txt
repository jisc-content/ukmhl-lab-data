The Sclerotic and cornea form the external tunic of the eyeball, and give to it its peculiar form. Four-fifths of the globe are invested by the sclerotic, the remaining fifth by the cornea. Fig. 2f.* The Sclerotic {fig. 29. \.Jig.Zc2. l.) (er/cX^o?, hard) is a dense fibrous membrane, thicker behind than in front. It is continuous, posteriorly, with the sheath of the optic nerve, which is derived from the dura mater, and it is pierced by that nerve as well as by the ciliary nerves and arteries. Anteriorly it presents a bevelled edge, which receives the cornea in the same way that a watch-glass is received by the groove in its case. Its anterior surface is covered by a thin tendinous layer, the tunica albuginea * Fig. 29. The external tunic of the eye. No. 1. The sclerotic coat. 2.

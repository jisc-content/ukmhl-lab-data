MUSCLES. DEEP GROUP. 56 from the ground, as dancing, leaping, &c. Taking their* fixed point from below, they steady the leg upon the foot. Deep Group. An Intermuscular fascia serves to separate the super- ficial from the deep group, and by its strong attachments to the bones at each side, binds down the muscles closely in their places. On removing this fascia, the muscles are brought clearly into view â€” Popliteus, Flexor longus pollicis, Flexor longus digitorum, Tibialis posticus. The Popliteus muscle (poples, the ham of the leg) forms the floor of the popliteal region at its lower part, and is bound tightly down by a strong fascia derived from the middle slip (page 39.) of the tendon of the semi-mem- branosus muscle. It arises by a rounded tendon from a deep groove on the outer side of the external condyle of the femur, beneath the external lateral ligament. It spreads obliquely over the head of the tibia, and is inserted into the surface of bone above its oblique line. This line is often called, from being the limit of insertion of the popliteus muscle, popliteal line. The Flexor longus pollicis is the most superficial of the three next muscles. It arises from the lower two thirds of the fibula, passes through a distinct tendinous canal into the sole of the foot, and is inserted into the base of the last phalanx of the great toe. The Flexor longus digitorum (perforans) arises from the surface of the tibia, immediately below the popliteal line. Its tendon passes through a sheath common to it and the tibialis posticus behind the inner malleolus into the sole of the foot, where it divides into four tendons, which are inserted into the base of the last phalanx of the four lesser toes, perforating the tendons of the flexor brevis digitorum. The flexor longus pollicis must now be removed from its origin, and the flexor longus digitorum drawn aside, to bring into view the entire extent of the tibiali sposticus. The Tibialis posticus (extensor tarsi tibialis) lies upon

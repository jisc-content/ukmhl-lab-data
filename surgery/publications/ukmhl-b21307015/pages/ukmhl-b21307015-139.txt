109 PALMAR REGION. â€” MUSCLES. and the extensor1 minimi digiti supplies that finger with the power of exercising a distinct extension. Palmar Region. The Muscles of the hand are arranged hi three groups : a radial group belonging to the thumb; an ulnar group to the little finger ; and a palmar group situated in the middle of the palm of the hand. The muscles of the Radial group are the Abductor pollicis, Flexor ossis metacarpi (opponens), Flexor brevis pollicis. Adductor pollicis. The Abductor pollicis arises from the scaphoid bone and annular ligament. It is inserted into the base of the first phalanx. Cut this muscle from its origin, and turn it upwards; you will then see The Flexor ossis metacarpi (misnamed opponens); it arises from the trapezium and annular ligament, and is inserted into the whole length of the metacarpal bone. The flexor ossis metacarpi may now be divided from its origin and turned aside, in order to show the next muscle. The Flexor brevis pollicis consists of two portions, be- tween which lies the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis. The external portion arises from the trapezium and an- nular ligament; the internal portion from the trapezoides and os magnum. They are both inserted into the base of the first phalanx of the thumb, having a sesamoid bone in each of their tendons to protect the joint. The Adductor pollicis is a triangular muscle; it arises from the os magnum and metacarpal bone of the middle finger; the fibres converge to its insertion into the base of the first phalanx. Ulnar group. The muscles of the little finger are the Abductor minimi digiti, Flexor brevis minimi digiti, Ilexor ossis metacarpi (adductor). On removing the integument from the ball of the little finger, a thin layer of muscular fibres is found between

246 LATERAL VENTRICLE. — FLOOR. into its substance. It is grey on the exterior, and of a pyriform shape. The broad end, directed forwards, rests against the corpus striatum of the opposite side ; the small end, backwards, is separated from its fellow by the interposition of the thalami optici. The corpus striatum is the superior ganglion of the cerebrum. The Tenia semicircularis [tenia, a fillet) is a narrow band of medullary substance, extending along the pos- terior border of the corpus striatum, and serving as a bond of connection between that body and the thalamus opticus. It is partly concealed by a large vein (vena corporis striata), formed by small vessels from the corpus striatum and thalamus opticus. This vein terminates in the venae Galeni. The vein is also overlaid by a yellowish band, a thick- ening of the lining membrane of the ventricle. This was first noticed and described by Tarinus, under the name of the horny band. We may, therefore, term it tenia Tarini. * The Thalamus opticus [thalamus, a bed) is an oblong body, having a thin coating of white substance on its sur- face ; it has received its name from being the origin of the optic nerve. It is the inferior ganglion of the cere- brum. The border only of the thalamus is seen in the floor of the lateral ventricle. We shall, therefore, defer its further description until we can examine it in its entire extent. The Choroid plexus (xopiov— £<So?, resembling the chorion) is a vascular fringe extending obliquely across the floor of the lateral ventricle, and sinking into the middle cornu. Anteriorly it is small and tapering, and communicates with the choroid plexus of the opposite ventricle, through a large oval opening, the foramen of Munro. This foramen (fig. 25. 9.) maybe distinctly seen by pulling slightly on the plexus, and pressing aside the septum lucidum with the handle of the knife. It is * Peter Tarin, a French anatomist: his work, entitled “ Adver- saria Anatomica,” was published in 1750.

Fig. s.* The Internal cutaneous nerve, {fig. 8. 15.) is one of the internal and smallest of the branches of the axillary plexus : it pierces the fascia imme- diately below the axilla, and runs down the inner side of the upper arm, to the bend of the elbow, where it divides into several branches, which pass in front of the median basilic vein, and are distributed to the in- tegument on the inner side of the fore-arm as far as the hand, communicating in their course with the external cutaneous. The Intercosto-humeral cuta- neous nerves are the external branches of the first, second, and third intercostal nerves: they pierce the external inter- costal muscle, and supply the parts in the axilla and the in- tegument on the inner side of the arm. That from the second intercostal nerve is the longest * Fig. 8. The superficial anatomy of the bend of the elbow. No. 1. The radial vein. 2. The cephalic vein. 3. The anterior ulnar vein. 4.

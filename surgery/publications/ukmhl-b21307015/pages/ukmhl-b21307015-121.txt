91 AXILLARY PLEXUS OF NERVES. Formed by Anterior branches' of the four last Axillary cervical nerves " Plexus. and first dorsal. Humeral Branches. " Short thoracic. Long thoracic. Supra-scapular. Subscapular. Descending Branches. External cutaneous, Median, Internal cutaneous, Ulnar, Circumflex, Musculo-spiral. The Short thoracic nerves {Jig. 7. 9. 13.), two or three in number, are distributed to the muscles and integument at the upper part of the thorax accompanying the supe- rior and inferior thoracic arteries. The Long thoracic (external respiratory of Bell) is a long branch arising from the fourth and fifth cervical nerves, immediately after their escape from the interver- tebral foramina. It passes down behind the plexus and upon the side of the chest, resting on the serratus magnus muscle, to which it is distributed. The Supra-scapular nerve passes backwards to the notch in the superior border of the scapula, through which it emerges into the supra-spinous fossa, supplying the supra-spinatus and neighbouring muscles. The Subscapular nerves are three in number ; they pass inwards, and supply the subscapularis muscle. One of them, larger than the others, accompanies the sub- scapular artery, and distributes branches to the adjoining muscles. The terminal branches of the plexus are arranged in the following order â€” the external cutaneous, and one head of the median to the outer side of the artery ; the other head of the median, internal cutaneous, and ulnar, upon its inner side; and the circumflex and musculo-spiral behind. The External cutaneous nerve {fig.*l. \T.,Jig.^>. 14.) (musculo-cutaneous, perforans Casserii) pierces the coraco-brachialis muscle, then passes between the biceps and brachialis anticus, to the outer side of the bend of the
